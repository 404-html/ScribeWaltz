Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Well, hey fuckers, ha ha

Bitch. This episode of the Joe Rogan experience is brought to you by legal zoom. If you have a situation like you want to become incorporated, do you want to become an LLC? You want to make a will. Uh, you want to handle some standard legal stuff.

Speaker 1:          00:00:56       Most of the time you got to go to a lawyer, you got to make an appointment, go somewhere, sit down, talk to some dude or a woman, give them a ton of money. And it's very frustrating that you can't handle that stuff on your own. Legal Zoom though allows you to handle most of those types of transactions. Like will's like, uh, becoming yellow, an LLC. All those things you can do online. Naked. Okay? You don't even have to be sober. You could be playing with yourself. You could have your cock in one hand and a mouse and the other and no one can stop you. Man. They can't tell you what to do. They don't own you. Okay? But if you go to, there's silly little legal box, the legal box, we have to say, hi, the lady that sits at the desk and once to fucking jump off a bridge, you have to say, how did that check bored out of her skull?

Speaker 1:          00:01:47       And then you have to give up credit card information, your address and your this and your that. And then you wait for the guy to let you in and then, oh Jesus. And then somebody cops on you as SARS. Oh, Brett Dunkin. That's not what happens. Anyway, legal zoom.com go there and check it out. Use the code. J R e and save yourself some money. Is it January? No. Legal Zoom is rogue again. Which ones? Jerry? Uh, they really should all be universal stamp dot coms Jerry. Yeah, use a code name Brogan and save yourself some money. It's an excellent service. Brian is actually used it, although I, you know, I wouldn't really and really bring that up, but they can do things for you and they can also get you in touch with a legitimate independent attorney if you get like along the process and you know, I've done this before with certain things where you're a, you're going over some fine print of something and you're like, oh, okay, I got to stop here.

Speaker 1:          00:02:40       I don't know what the fuck I'm doing this. This shit just got deep. I just wanted to deep water. Well if you, if you feel that way, legal zoom can connect you with an independent attorney and a legal team is not a law firm. They just offer you legal services online that you could do yourself. They will guide you through it. But if you get confused, they hook you up with an attorney. Use a code name rogue and save yourself some money. We'll also brought to you by stamps.com if you've ever been in those desk squad kitty cat shirts at Brian red band cells and there's a new one on the way out. Uh, it's available right now for presale. If you go a death squad.tv, it's my favorite yet. It's pretty dope malicious and it's a much higher quality than the other ones with uh, the, the ink is like printed into the shirt itself instead of being like a plastic decal.

Speaker 1:          00:03:27       They're very cool. Brian Cells, all of those himself does, it makes them himself hasn't printed and then actually sends them out himself. So if you get a box from Brian, read Ben, it's been touched by his DNA. It might, it's, it's healthy. I mean it's not, it's on dangerous DNA, but you know you, you could convict him or something if you wanted to like take this box and he licked things on there and you could say, this motherfucker licked my ass and just stick it on your ass and then go directly to a doctor and then they swab your ass with the cute. My point is stamps.com is a simple way of sending things through the mail with just using your own personal computer and a printer. Instead of going to the post office with a box of shit that you're trying to sell and have it all laid out, you could do it all at home.

Anyway, you use the code j r e@stamps.com and save yourself some money and excellent service one that we fully endorse here on the Joe Rogan experience podcast. This episode is also brought to you by on it. And this is the last sponsor, I swear to the baby Jesus. Um, on it. Makers of Alpha brain, the cognitive nootropic subst. Well, I don't know if most people don't know what the fuck you're talking about.

Speaker 1:          00:05:10       When you say new tropics, when nootropics are, is essentially vitamins that enhance the way your brain functions. It gives you all the fuel that you need to create neurotransmitters, the building blocks, if you will, a very controversial stuff. Read up on it. But one thing that I can tell you with utmost confidence now is we've already done the first in a series of double blind placebo tests and had excellent results with Alpha brain. So that was a big relief because you take something and even though you read a bunch of shit that says it does a really good, and even though you're read all these positive results and even though you read even peer reviewed evidence about the actual ingredients that are in Alpha brain until you get your own double blind placebo study, people don't give a fuck about you. Unfortunately it was only, we did it with 20 people and four dropped out.

Speaker 1:          00:05:56       It's enough to to have like a full blown study. So we're going to do another one. But the point is the results were positive and it was done the correct way. Double Blind Placebo Style and a, it showed improvements in memory, improvements in cognitive function. We'll explain it all once the uh, the piece is published, but it's a huge weight off my back and a lot of the people's back because rightly so, whenever someone comes out with something that says that it's a brain enhancing supplement, people start thinking about all those big Dick pills that you see and those porn ads don't really work. You start thinking about, oh, a lot of other snake oil type situations. I personally have been using nootropics though for a long time. I started out with a Roman house skis neuro one. It's a, a, a common atory a thing like this that you mix it, you make a drink out of it. And I, uh, I read about it and Bill Roman [inaudible] who was a football player, he started making that stuff, uh, and using nootropics after dealing with head injuries from concussions from football. It's a fascinating topic that most people are kind of ignorant about. But if you're, if you're interested in it, I suggest you pursue it because there is definitely some fruit at the end of that tree. Um, we're also, um,

Speaker 2:          00:07:06       can I pipe in for a second? Yeah. I'm not sponsored by on it for some reason. I don't know what I did do it Venda on it company. So, but I can honestly say because I have no financial stake at all. In fact, I've been rejected by the company that I love. I take Alpha brain and what Joe won't say, is it speed? It's just, it's good speed. It's like low level Adderall. I don't get that at all. I don't get that at all. It's not, that's not what

Speaker 1:          00:07:36       the function of the nutrients inside of it or, or you know, like designed to do.

Speaker 2:          00:07:40       Yeah, it gives me a very good, when I say speed, I don't mean bad. I mean that's good. It's like a nice buzz. You take it and you feel awake. I like taking it a all day when I have it. I go through the jars within three days. They're just gone. Well, it gives you weird dreams. Oh fuck man. My, I took a nap today that was like Jacob's ladder taking Alpha brain and I swear I was in it, an airplane sucking on the feet of this woman. She was flying the plane. Yeah. And I was like laying on dirt, sucking her feet. I had an offer for

Speaker 1:          00:08:21       brain dream the other day. Uh, I tweeted about it. It was about Bobby Collins. The comedian was doing a talk show out of his apartment and in the opening montage of his talk show is Sam Kinison his comb over and it's flying around the air, getting pelted by meteors while it's flying around, just like explosions. His comb overs flying around in the sky and the meteors are hitting his comb over. It was the most nonsensical, ridiculous. You can't make this up dream. And I woke up in the middle of it because my alarm went off and it was one of those where it's like, you're right in the middle rem sleep and you'll, your alarm wakes up and you're like, what the fuck? Yeah, that is good. I don't, I think that was one of the best pieces of at least anecdotal evidence. Alpha brain actually was working that was doing something was the, the uniformity of the reports of people saying that it affected their dreams in a very radical way.

Speaker 1:          00:09:13       Why are you making everything Paul Pink? Uh, go to [inaudible] dot com it's a lot of the shit we sell, including Kettlebells, these primal bells that, or kettle bells with a awesome designs carved into them. We hired a special effects designer to make an angry, angry chimp. We've got a gorilla coming out soon. We've got a a bunch of a really cool designs in the future. We sell a bunch of healthy shoots that's tossed around. We sell powders. It enhances your body's ability to produce testosterone. All of these things. Also, all these controversial things. They're all explained with science and references on on [inaudible] dot com use the code name Brogan. Save 10% off Duncan trussell's here and were fin to get our free gone. Hello. Hey pitches.

Speaker 3:          00:09:57       Oh, good experience. Joe Rogan podcast by night all day. Ooh,

Speaker 1:          00:10:07       Nice. So that worked all day. Did the show all day. And this never feels like work. This always feels like, ah, the podcast, the podcast. It's nothing. It's not work. I mean, it isn't. It isn't. It's never,

Speaker 4:          00:10:20       I mean, if you start thinking this is work, there's going to be a lot of coal miners. You think your toxic Duncan Trussell on TV today. Oh, crazy. Yeah. Kind of freaking out it.

Speaker 1:          00:10:35       I thought you would handle it well, but you're not. You kind of tricking, tweaking a little bit.

Speaker 3:          00:10:39       I'm excited. How do I not be excited about this? I'm just fine

Speaker 4:          00:10:44       with, you know, you're handling it very well. I mean, it's exciting and it's like a thank you for getting me on the show. Thanks for doing it. You may of that. That's a cool thing. Manda usher uh, your friends into something like that. Cause it's, it's, so, it's been such a freakish year for me, man. You know, it's like in the beginning was fucked up. Balls snipped off for folks who don't know, you got cancer of your balls, ball got snipped. They took one of your testicles home. They threw it. Oh, I always wonder where it is. It's going to cat's litter box somewhere. But it's great because the year culminated in being out in the Pacific northwest with you.

Speaker 3:          00:11:27       Hi. As a fucking watching hunting for Sasquatch,

Speaker 4:          00:11:35       it really was like, well this is great man. This is like a one. This is, this is definitely one of the coolest years of my life. That was so fun. It was so fun. It really is. It's like

Speaker 1:          00:11:44       we've sort of, we've made this life inside of a simulation. Like it doesn't make any sense. Like when you actually have a job where you get to go. Like we went Utah last week looking

Speaker 5:          00:11:54       for Ufos and giant bulletproof wolves. These people, they see wolves that turn into messed and disappear and the fucking show up on top of barns. The size of a horse. Yeah. Bulletproof wolves. The size of a horse. We're, we're having so much fun. It's so ridiculous. Like we're talking to so many crazy people and so many really interesting like sciencey people too.

Speaker 4:          00:12:15       Yeah. It's so fun to be around, that's for sure man. It's definitely spun me around in a lot of ways. It's helped me understand how religions starts. It's helped me. I go stand delusion. Yeah. It's helped me understand that part of myself that is delusional or the part of myself that uh, is either too eager to disbelieve something, are too eager to believe something. Like that's where my pendulum swings. Right? Like, and in that middle place, people don't like that middle place places. Yeah. People don't like it there, you know? Cause that middle place is the mystery. People don't like that feeling. That's why I live. Yeah. That's my spot. Yeah. I think it's cool to get there, but God dammit, it's like that's no fun. I mean

Speaker 5:          00:12:57       be there with my life too though. I like to be there with my life. I like to be, that's one of the reasons why I do so many different things. At the same time, I don't like to be comfortable that much. I mean I like too comfortable in friendships and I like to be comfortable in relationships. But as far as like work stuff and life stuff and and, and my pursuits, whether it's a competition or exercising, I don't like to be comfortable. I think that's, that's the enemy. I like to be plenty comfortable when I'm at home and I'm lounging, yeah, I'm chilling with my family or I'm hanging with my friends. I love being comfortable then. But other than that I don't like it. So like when it, when it comes with an idea, like an idea of what is or isn't, what is or isn't possible, that middle spot of the pendulum where it's all weird.

Speaker 5:          00:13:38       That's my favorite spot because I like when you're in a situation and people go big foot, you believe in big foot and then you bring a guy like Jeff Meldrum, that guy that we talked to, the anthropologist who is, you know, you've got a phd, an expert in human movement. And he starts explaining things like the metatarsal break that you find in these footprints that indicates it's built like a gorilla's foot, not like a human foot because human beings don't have, and then you see this break and he demonstrates it and then you start going, huh, you're talking to a fucking smart dude. The believes his shit. Like this is weird. Yeah. And then we asked him if we'd be willing to cut off a pinky. Oh yeah. Toe. I, yeah. Got Weird. You have to watch the show Dunkin.

Speaker 4:          00:14:21       I can't have to wash the shaking and watch myself on TV. Oh, you can. You were great. Uh, the, uh, the, that place is a very zen place, man. That's like, why this a Zen Roshi I met when I went on this Rom doss retreat. That's what she kept saying again, again, is live in the mystery. That's where we belong, is in the mystery. It's, you don't, you can't, you're not going to know what happens after you die. You're not going to figure that out. And the place of like the Zen place or the Buddhist or the nonattached place to be as a place where you are, it's not that you don't know or do know, it's some other state of just, I guess being at the crest of the wave of the universe articulating itself and as you,

Speaker 5:          00:15:04       yeah, and what's important when I say that I like to be in the ministry, what I, what I really mean like that about that is if it's a mystery and there's some shifts, it's not a mystery at all. And that's also a part of the thing. It's recognizing what is an actual ministry. And when you do find it, like the nature of reality, if you get to one of those weird ones, the possibility of a universal power that's controlling the world and moving it into a certain direction. The idea that this is all some sort of a mathematical program and that good and evil and sex and love and all this different shit, good and bad, all sort of make sure that this thing keeps moving. That's the real mystery. It's not chem trails. Okay. You know what I'm saying? Like it's, it's not, it's not ghosts.

Speaker 5:          00:15:53       The real me. There's plenty of mystery. The real mystery is does every decision that you make literally branch off and start a whole new reality and a whole universe that you live in? Because sometimes it feels like that and I'm not sure, and I don't think you're sure either. When someone tells me they're sure or are shorts not, are they sure there? Sure. It is either one of those. It's unacceptable because you can't be sure. There's things that you can't be shoring. Those things are really weird and it's hard to get comfortable in those things. It's hard to get comfortable, like holding on, holding on to those ideas and like and pondering them because a lot of them, the implications they, they, they transfer through your entire life. The implications are, well if you really are building up a career and bill, but you're, you're, you're just a part of the ether and you're part of like some sort of a gigantic super organism. Like why are you concentrating so much on yourself? Like why are you twisting your mustache at the end with wax? Why you, why you doing this? Why you buying, you know, $2,000 shoes that you hope somebody notices? Why are you, you know, what are you doing? W what, what is going on? Yeah. Are those things distracting you from the mystery,

Speaker 4:          00:16:57       you know? Well, I mean it seems like there's two parts to a person, which is the, the, the part that is the personality that conditioning everything you've learned, all the, all the tricks that you've learned from other people. A lot of imitation, you know, a lot of observing things in the, imitating them and forgetting that you imitated them. There's probably personality and components in us that we picked up in the fourth grade from some kid we thought was cool and just forgot about it and it stuck inside of us. And so then there's this idea that we're kind of like, uh, the human body itself is a hive and it is a hive that within which dwell all these different bees and the bees are all the different aspects of our personality. We're not one person. We're a harmony of personalities that are always sort of through cause like if you think of the you and you're really pissed off whenever you're yelling at someone or in a state where you find yourself in a confrontational place and then you think of the you and you're chilling at home with your family, that's like two different people, you know.

Speaker 4:          00:18:04       And so that's the idea is that there's all these different parts of us that are rolling through all the time, always rolling through and that we are constantly working to uphold the continuity of being by acting in certain ways all the time. And quite often you'll hear us like if you're in a relationship or something, someone will say like, I don't know you anymore. It was this person you know and it's because really what they're seeing is the other one something, one of the other dominant personalities that lives inside of you that starting to poke its head out every once in awhile and people that don't have a good transition between those. Those are the people we call multiple personality disorder people. Yes, exactly. And how many, how many Abby's are in there with you Abby? Yeah man. That's what it is and when those, when those in and you see are, when people say that they're channeling or when people are demon possessed, really what's happening is one of these personalities that is gotten shoved way deep down in the dark part of the hive is managed to claw it's way out and it's so different than all the other ones that people are like, this guy has got a demon in him when really the truth is we're just this cluster of of selves that are all sort of like the way it's been.

Speaker 4:          00:19:18       This, I heard there's this mystic named Gurdjieff who described it as like a mansion where all the servants are running amok. So it's a mansion where all the servants who were supposed to have certain jobs and certain areas where they work in the mansion of just lost and forgotten what they're supposed to be doing. They're all going crazy. And so then modern person is wandering around with this kind of constant, chaotic stream of personalities that aren't disciplined in any way. And so the beginning of spiritual life for the beginning of discipline, martial arts, whatever the thing is, is where the master of the house returns. And that's considered the personality that develops. Once you control all those different facets of the self, and that's what you become is the master of the House who's gone away. And while he was away, all of the servants went nuts. That's what happens when you get drunk like gay, the mass design here. Woo. Yeah. There were over your face [inaudible] tags.

Speaker 4:          00:20:17       Yeah. Where's my keys? Yeah. And it's also why you have to be compassionate to people. If someone around you has been a dick to you. So you know some really stupid people when someone's addicted them will never forgive them for the rest of your life. You'd be like, you remember the time you said that to me? Oh, you know, and it's like, well, that was just a part of me that came out. That's not me. That's not the totality of me. That's just somebody made who managed to get to the window and scream, scream something. That's a real problem. Those people that want to bring up, that happened a long

Speaker 1:          00:20:48       time ago over and over and over again. Oh. And just always use it as a button to get sympathy. Like, that's not good. That's not healthy for you. It's not healthy for them. It's not healthy for anybody. Like people that can't let certain things. I mean, there's certain things you shouldn't let go. You know? Like if you were in a concentration camp and Hitler killed your family, you'd be like, Hey Dick, you know my family. But if you're like, you know, if you yelled at someone because he didn't want to get up and take out the trash, like let's you know, let that go.

Speaker 4:          00:21:18       Yeah, you got to let it go. Mostly you gotta just let it go if you can. It's, it's hard though man. I mean I, I ruminate over shit that people have done to me sometimes. Like I'll find myself from ruminating it, which is such a waste, such a waste of time. Dude, I had Graham Hancock, I skyped with Graham Hancock on my podcast today. Oh that's beautiful. Blew my mind man. He like, that guy is so God damn smart.

Speaker 1:          00:21:41       He's got a book out now, a fiction book called War War War Guy. Yeah. And he's really excited about it

Speaker 4:          00:21:47       when he starts talking about history. It's amazing cause you feel like you're with somebody who is actually lived during that time when he was describing like a Mayan sacrifices. When he starts talking about that, it's not like reading it in a history book. Like when he talks about the jagged Flint tools to slice open the chest. I'm not even doing it. I get why? Don't know what acronyms, terrible accident. But he, yeah, the thing he was talking about today, and it was, I, it was, you know, inspired from talking about his book is this idea a gnostic idea, which is, uh, gnosticism is this weird philosophy that believes that the god that everyone worships currently, uh, and, and all the different religions, the Christian God, the, uh, Muslim God, any God that's being worshiped is actually an evil force known as the demiurge. It's something that is, uh, actually Satan. So the thing that the Christians are the thing that whispers in the Christians ear, that it's time to go to war or the thing that convinces some uninstall omic terrorist, a strap, plastic explosives to his chest and go running into a cafe. It's like an evil force that's been controlling the planet and manipulating the people on the planet by pretending to be a god and causing them to do insane things. Where's this concept come from? Not, it's called gnosticism.

Speaker 1:          00:23:14       Well, I know at Gnosticism is, but this concept of that is from,

Speaker 4:          00:23:17       yeah, and that's the demiurge and the demiurge created humans. So humans are all the children of the demiurge. Humans are the children of this force, which is kind of the spirit of matter that is all about dominance and fear, right?

Speaker 1:          00:23:33       Troll what a crazy idea. And that's why people like overwhelmingly throughout human history, there's never been a period of time where no one's done anything evil ever. There's never been a period of time as far we can tell as far

Speaker 5:          00:23:46       as written history, there's never been a period of time where nobody controlled anybody. Nobody hit anybody, nobody murdered anybody. And then we stole anything. Nobody raped anybody, nobody beat their kids. There's never been one time where like nothing happened bad for like a year. Everybody was just hugs and love and kisses. But yet we hold on to this idea that well, people were mostly good. We're basically good. Yeah, peaceful in their hearts. All people are basically good. But if you look at the totality of the, the behavior of human beings and you factor in the time of utmost piece to time of ultimate peace, it's a zero. There's 0% ultimate peace in the totality of the human race. It's never happened. Yup, that's right. You occasionally get that in the household. You occasionally get that in a community where there's just a mild disagreements. They tried to keep it to a little bit of Shit, talking behind people's back, you know? But then as you spread out and he'd get into cities, there's no cities where nobody gets robbed. No, they don't exist in religion.

Speaker 4:          00:24:45       Communities want to talk about some fucking stink holes. Dude, I'm reading this book by Jon Krakauer called under the banner of Heaven, which is about fundamentalist Mormons. Do you know about this? No. Whew. Holy Shit. Does that like the Jeffries Guy? Yeah, there's it. I think so. The Jeffries, which was the Jeffries Guy,

Speaker 5:          00:25:06       was the guy that goes, just got arrested. He was the polygamists.

Speaker 4:          00:25:10       Yes, yes, yes. Yeah. It's, so here's the way it works. There is, in this book it talks about, I can't remember the town, but there is an area that is run completely by a guy named Uncle Ruan or was run by this guy named uncle rule on who is a Mormon fundamentalist. This, these are, these people are rejected by the, uh, mainstream Mormons because the government came in at one point and said, you guys can't be polygamous. It's illegal. And so they had to renounce polygamy. And this was something that according to this book, Joseph Smith said was the essence of Mormonism. It's still one of the most deepest, most important parts of Mormonism is that you have multiple, or what they call a plurality of wives, morality. That's good learning. So, and here's the thing. This is why you need a bunch of wives. If you are a fundamentalist Mormon, you are only supposed to have sex with your wife when she's ovulating.

Speaker 4:          00:26:03       Which means if you only have one wife, you're not only going to have sex a few times a month, once a month. I don't know how women ovulate once a month. If you have 15 wives, you can fuck every night. So it's very important to have as many wives as possible because then you could have sex with them all the time. And they're always humping. And a lot of these guys have so many children. They, one of the, I can't remember which one it was. It might've been uncle Ruan. I can't remember which one had so many children that they named them according to the year. So if you were born in like 1979 you are, your name would have an ae. So it'd be like an about Angus Ari. And then you would, what year your kid was born in by the first letter of his name.

Speaker 4:          00:26:46       Wow. That's how many kids are having. So then you have girls and your girls get to be the age of 14 and you've got a pal. Like if I had a 14 year old kid and I was a fundamentalist Mormon, I feel like, Joe, why don't you marry my daughter Laurie? She just started bleeding and then I would give her to you and you would immediately start fucking her. And so that's what they're doing out there. It's like, it's just like just herds and packs of pregnant teenagers that have been impregnated by these older dudes who have so many wives. And this shit is, I think it's still going on today, man. There's whole communities dedicated to this polygamist lifestyle, which is a lifestyle that Joseph Smith said was one of the most important aspects of Mormonism according to this book. The other thing about Joseph Smith, do you know what he did before he found he founded Mormonism?

Speaker 4:          00:27:42       What he was what was called like a treasure seeker and so you would use magic stones to peer through to that would show you our secret treasure was buried and he, there was a huge lawsuit against him because he convinced all these people that he could find Berridge pressure. That was also what he said about the golden tablets. Yeah, that was it. He could use a seer stone and see it through a magic rock. That's how he could read the golden tablets before he was doing the seer stone and the angel a mower Moroni before he's using the seer stone and the Angel Moroni came to him. He was actually getting work convincing people like, hey look, I've got a magic rock and there and I can find your silver for you. Because there was like a guy who hired him because he knew that there was some silver hidden up in the hills somewhere and Joseph Smith went around with like wards looking through the courts and finally after like three months of hiring him by the month, they took him to court and they're like, hey, this guy can't really find treasure with that.

Speaker 4:          00:28:43       Rock me. Well, he's out there looking every day. Wouldn't you have loved to seen like a video of him talking of Joseph Smith, like talking and explaining his strategies and what he does and you know what Mormonism is all about. Yeah, man. I mean, exactly. I just love, I just love that idea of like, uh, that here's a man who was, look, come on, let's just admit it. Here's a man who's like, just basically like a classic con artists. Come on, man. You're really telling people you can find treasure with a rock. No one's ever found treasure. That's something like when I was in the third grade that I would lie about to a kid in the playground or something, but this guy was making money off of it. It's just very interesting to see something grow roots and, and flourish in the way that that Mormonism has when, when just with a very simple investigation end of the, uh, you've got lawsuits, there's written records against Joseph Smith. Yeah. Cause he was taken to court for lying.

Speaker 5:          00:29:54       No, no, no, no, no. But the angels really did take the golden tablets. He really, he really is the, the one he really did find the loss work of Jesus. He really can look at it with a magic rock. And for him it was always a magic rock. Yeah. Magic rock. That was his, that was his angle. It magic rocks. But meanwhile, when we were in Utah, we were in Utah the other day and docking and I show up and when we arrive, there was these hordes of people that were waiting for these elders and the elders of the young kids that go away on a mission. Yeah. All Mormons when they're young or they're old, they're supposed to go on these recruiting missions as elders where they go, they wear a suit and tie and they go to third world countries or wherever they go. Some of them go to third world countries and they recruit people and so these guys were returning from their missions and they were all like dolled up in their finest suits and what their ties on and when they showed up people just scream and cheer and it was for Dunkin.

Speaker 5:          00:30:53       I was so strange because we were like these weird heretics that are walking through them were high. We've got coffee in our hands. They're not even allowed to drink coffee. And so by the way, by the way, by the way, they're also one of the highest per capita users of antidepressants because the fact they're not allowed to drink and not allowed to take coffee. They are allowed to take prescription medications. So weird. They just chomped at shit.

Speaker 4:          00:31:18       Isn't that weird? Yeah, it's really weird. Especially when when like sober people like people who are like really into being into sobriety or like chomping on like Xanax and shit. And it's like, what's the why? What's the difference between that and booze? Really?

Speaker 5:          00:31:31       I know a woman who criticizes pot on a regular, but she's very ignorant. She Criticizes Pod, she takes his Xanax every night to go to sleep. She cannot sleep without a Xanax. She'll take a Xanax and that's how she goes to sleep.

Speaker 4:          00:31:44       Yeah, man, I, it's a really confused, that's a very confusing issue. Drugs are bad. I, that's why I love Terence Mckenna's breakdown of that, where he's like, come on every morning we are brewing a fucking drug. We wake up every morning and we haven't machines designed to extract alkaloids from coffee beans that we put into our bloodstream before we go to work every morning. And that's not looked down as strange at all. And not only that, every labor contract is negotiated with a break for this drug in it. The coffee break. Yeah, but that doesn't count. So when you tell people like, wait, no, really the entire planet or this it North America wakes up slurps back a drug every morning just to get ready to go to their jobs and then they take, what are they called? Coffee breaks and coffee breaks. If you were telling me like, Hey, I'm going to go take a cocaine break, do you mind if I call you gotta you gotta fucking problem. Well, how about

Speaker 5:          00:32:41       fact that they're taking Xanax to go to sleep and then they get drunk on the weekend?

Speaker 4:          00:32:44       Well, yeah, you add on top of it that they're getting drunk. They're taking, uh, Xanax and pets. Very popular nowadays. It's very popular. I understand why it's, have you done it? Yeah. What's it like? It's awesome. You just like go to instantaneous, like an instant relaxed. I'm trying to, okay. Like, let me, I'll try to think of a description of it. Okay. Think about a night when you've had a really good show and you wake up the next morning and you're laying in bed, you've had a good sleep, you're not hung over. And it that dawning realization like, man, that was a good show last night, but you're still relaxed and laying in bed and you're like, ah, that's what Xanax does. Fau. Yeah, just it's like the opposite of any kind of anxiety or uh, any kind of like tightening up. You might have it gets rid of that, but I've noticed that, uh, there's a bit of a residual effect with it. It's not a clean drug. At least it hasn't been for me where like a couple of days after you take it, you feel kind of greasy and weird. And when I've taken Xanax, I've gotten the hiccups, which is really strange. Yeah. I'll start like having like Xanax hiccups. The way I've heard it

Speaker 5:          00:33:54       bribed is that you, it, it, it alleviates a lot of your anxiety, but then it's almost like a rubber band. It like snaps back. It gives you more anxiety than you had before. Um, my friend who takes it, he tells me he has, he takes it almost every day and he can't get along without it. He needs it like for anxiety. He tells me when he gets off of it, he gets really freaked out.

Speaker 4:          00:34:16       What the fuck is anxiety, man? I, that's the reality. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          00:34:20       The reality of your life, the reality of your body. This guy who, uh, is uh, addicted to it, he takes it every day. He's also a, he's also overweight and he also drinks too much. Right. He's got issues and so he, I don't think he likes to address those issues. Right. And so instead of addressing those issues, he says he has anxiety.

Speaker 4:          00:34:41       Man. There are certain things though that were where anxiety is unavoidable, man. I like, I just think there's certain times that emerge in your life where anxiety is not all a lot of the time it's an indication that you're fucking up. Yes. But sometimes it's just a natural reaction to life. It's so high. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          00:35:01       Life itself. The inevitability of your demise. There's no getting around it. You know, the, the, the ruthlessness of the day to day grind can also give you anxiety. The idea that even though it's Friday and you're off of work, oh my God, I'm going to have to go back there on Monday and I'm gonna work eight to nine hours, whatever I have to do, including overtime, and then I'm going to do it again on Tuesday and then on Wednesday, and then on Thursday, and then Friday again, and then I'm gonna get a little break again. And during that break I got a lot of shit to do. So it's not really a break and that just that alone, as it accumulates over time, then you start to, you start to accumulate bills and you start to accumulate responsibilities, social responsibilities, responsibilities, and the pressure of all that. Ken, for Rick, you the fuck out because it's a never ending.

Speaker 5:          00:35:45       Just a, a line of ants that goes on for millions of miles. They're all tasks. Every, every ant that you see in front of you, every dot. Every just like a million pages is all things you have to do, things you have to read. And it never ends. If you have a job, a regular job, especially, that's one of the reasons why you should never, if you can avoid it, never have a job. I mean, if you need to have a job, get a job, but if you could find something that you love to do, you don't have a job, then what you are is a lucky fuck. Yeah. And then what you have is a cool gig. You know, like whether if you're a comedian or a chef or a carpenter or something you love, you know, a guy who builds motorcycles, he loves it. He goes to work on grammar. Yes. Anybody who loves doing what they're doing, that truly is the key to this life. And everybody's just going to be different. Your love is going to be different than my love. You can't really judge, can't judge what people like, what they don't like. You can judge what you like and don't like, but you know, it's like music tastes or tastes in food or anything. Things are weird. You know, things are weird and we vary wildly. But yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:36:46       Yeah. The, the, the uh, what I want to mention, the idea I've been thinking about of uh, um, uh, it's called a temporal, temporal peripheral vision, temporal, the temporal periphery. So like humans develop peripheral vision to deal with the predators so that it's something to two at the, to our side we could see a Predator coming. And so we have this kind of like side view that helps us out. It's a very important thing. Some animals don't have that. They can only look straight forward, right? But we have a, we're, we can see off to the side a little bit and that's a super important evolutionary trait. Well, we also have the exact same thing in the sense that, but it's a temporal peripheral vision where are, we can think about the past and we can think about the future. And anxiety is always related to things that we're looking at in the temporal periphery.

Speaker 2:          00:37:37       Nine Times out of 10, if you come into the present moment, you won't feel anxious. You could be sitting in a doctor's office about to go get your cat scan. And if you could really pull yourself just into the moment and what's happening there, you wouldn't be, you'd be 90% less afraid. But the moment you step past that sliver of the present moment, that light beam and end of the darkness of the future, that's where the anxiety pounds your fucking ass, man. It's like touching an electric fence. It's because things are always fine. If you really look at it, things are always fine. Up until the Zombie rips your intestines out of your stomach, things are generally pretty okay. You know that. That's the, so that's the real conundrum. And I think that's the, uh, the, um, the thing that is so perplexing about it being a human being, as you know, that you're carrying around with you. The ultimate, which is the present moment, but you can't stay in it. You don't have the discipline to stay there fully. You're always wandering off into the future, always wandering off into what you have to do, what's coming tomorrow, what's coming in the next few minutes. You know what I mean? It's so curious. That right there in front of us is the ultimate Xanax.

Speaker 5:          00:38:56       Well that's why the the shallow feelings of materialism, you know, what is materialism? Well it's fixating on objects to fill up your attention span for fixating on them instead of all the other shit that you could be thinking about instead of you. You're your own designing your own personal philosophy for life, finding out what you like and don't like about your past behavior and incorporating it into the present. Living in that moment, being aware of what's happening and managing it correctly. All that's too much. So you start thinking about the future. I'd love to have a house that's like 6,000 square feet and I want to have 50 acres of land. I want to be on top of a mountain and I want to have gun ports, you know, start, you just start counting points. You know what I'm saying? You start like thinking about shit.

Speaker 5:          00:39:38       Cause if those motherfuckers come, I'm going to be ready. And instead of like being like right there in that moment or you start thinking about you know what a piece of shit you were when you were a little kid and he used to yell at your mother. You mean you could start thinking about weird shit and it could fill up your present and it's part of being a human being is managing the thought that that you hold on to managing what you, what you gravitate towards. It's so hard to do if you just got fired from a job, it's very difficult to see the silver lining you like shit. You just, that feeling of getting just fucking kicked out of a job and someone doesn't want you work. Then when you are a failure you failed and you're like, Oh God, it's so hard to go.

Speaker 5:          00:40:20       Come on, let's go and have a good time. Like you don't want to have a good time. You feel fucking terrible that much because it's also, there's a dance going on, a balancing act, if you will. And that balancing act is you got to learn from the fuck ups and the only way you really learn is to feel like shit and you, it's best if you feel like shit for a while because then it really sinks in. The can't show up an hour late every day. You can't smell like whiskey after your lunch break. You can't yell at your boss because you're, you know, you've got to have a hangover and you're crabby that day. You can't do those things because you can get fired. And when you get fired at fucking sucks. But every time I've ever gotten fired in my whole life, why fucked up? And I got fired. I made like an evolutionary jump as a person after that. Absolutely. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:41:06       Every stupid thing that I've ever done that's resulted in disaster has always made me a million times better.

Speaker 5:          00:41:12       And why is that? Because you have a terrible feeling and you don't want to have that feeling again. So it's forcing you to really focus on whatever the hell it is.

Speaker 2:          00:41:21       Well, this is the, this is the, this is, I mean it's something that you don't want to accept. You know, you want it to be, you want the universe to be something that's more or something

Speaker 4:          00:41:34       that's that that's more compassionate, but it really does seem like a huge portion of what makes people great is their ability to overcome internal difficulties or external difficulties andF and failure and, and, and that's something that wouldn't, you're failing. It won't give you any, it won't help you when you're failing thinking like, oh, this is, I guess this is helping me. I guess it does relieve some of the pain of the thing when you realize that you're in a kiln and you're the failures that heat, that sort of transforming you into something.

Speaker 5:          00:42:06       Yeah. There's, I think that it's, the feelings are there, are they have they serve like an evolutionary purpose or a purpose that's in line with progress. A purpose that's in line with moving forward and taking things to a next level, which is why where we always feel at at our best. I always find that one of the reasons why I try to like do like a lot of things at once as cause I like figuring things out and I like when things get better. I like when a joke that I'm working on becomes better. I like when it grows and becomes real. Not like when you write something down then you add to it and then it becomes better. I like getting better at a skill, like a martial art or a game. I love getting, I love getting better at video games. It's a great feeling.

Speaker 5:          00:42:51       Yeah, and if you're not getting better at things, if you're not, if you don't have some sort of improvement in movement, if that's not the general trend that you find your life in, I find that I don't feel happy. I find that that greatly affects my happiness. And I also find that's one of the most difficult things to achieve if and when you have a job that you don't enjoy because the majority of your time and focus during the day, they take all your best hours. Man, you think about what a job is, a nine to five they take the hours that you are the most awake, the most tuned in, the most aware of, the most focused on the world. So if you want to figure out how to get out of your job, you got to take your weakest time. That's all they give you. They give you your time where you're the most tired and most likely to sit in from the TV and the most likely to just have a beer the most likely to take a nap. They give you those times and they say, all right, you want to get out of this fucking system. Here's your time.

Speaker 4:          00:43:44       Well, this is why I like chanting and I think chanting is a fantastic tool that you can use in those times because chanting something that you can do at work to get fired. No, you do it in your mind. You don't say it out loud, but in your mind you can start doing a mantra. Um, you definitely don't have to say mantras out loud. You could just say it in your mind so that, uh, in the midst of, uh, when stress comes, you can actually start training yourself to start doing a mantra inside of your mind and said, cause normally can't do that if you're working. Sure. If you have to interact with people and you have a good deal while you're talking to people, I'm doing it right now. I could do it right now. My mind, I can definitely write down how are you doing that if you're going to concentrate on what you're doing because it's something. Yeah. Can you give Audis? Yeah. Can you, can you what,

Speaker 5:          00:44:32       which Duncan, am I talking to you right now? Can you, um, do you think you could give something your full attention, like a job while you were chanting in the back of your head at the same time?

Speaker 4:          00:44:40       Honestly, the next time you find yourself in the midst of like working, you know, doing some mundanity and of your whatever it is, right? Watch, become mindful and you will see that some percentage of us focused on the task at hand. But then another part of you is always thinking, always thinking, always processing, always a whole other conversation is always going on in people's minds. It's an inevitability, you know, and some people have more focused than others, but in general there's always that, uh, that part of the mind that's like an electric wire and a puddle. There's just sort of skipping around and spraying out random thoughts. Well that's the part of your bind, that chance, that's the part of your mind that you begin to train to start doing it. A mantra, which is like a simple mantra. So that that thing, if you can, instead of it being like, ah man, what the fuck got out of the cat scan doesn't mean I have cancer. Jesus Christ, man, I wish my ges was wider. I fucking hate that song or whatever. Whatever. Here you, whatever your mind is stupidly spraying up, you start training that when you can. They would go

Speaker 6:          00:45:45       rom mom, mom, mom, mom,

Speaker 4:          00:45:49       and you read it. It's like throwing a dog. A bone. What? What? Why Rom Rom Ron. Was it just a sound? Just bad? It's a mantra that people recommend. It's cause it's got the on minute, but it also has this nice little are that you can wrong, wrong, wrong.

Speaker 5:          00:46:04       Do you think that people who have like ADHD or isn't Ada, which, which, which is the one that the guy on his deathbed said isn't real? Is it Adhd? Like add is real, but the guy who created the Adhd said it was bullshit. I don't know. Yeah, that's it's Adhd is that one? Yeah. What did, what was exactly what happened? He was on his deathbed. He's like, ah. I was just bullshitting.

Speaker 4:          00:46:23       Yeah. I wonder if he was being serious about it or if it was just because he was crazy. How is fucked? Right, right.

Speaker 5:          00:46:29       Yeah. What, what is the difference to add his attention deficit disorder and Adhd, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, isn't it? How much of the, I mean, how, how accurate is their prognosis or the diagnosis of add? Because so often they're dealing with kids and kids are bored as fuck, you know, and it's not because they have a disease. It's because you're making them do something boring as fuck. Like I know because I have children, I watch how how they develop as like little, little people sort of learning how to get through things. It's difficult for them to sit down. They got fucking energy. They want to dance and play and have fun. They want to throw things and, and wrestle with each other and play. When you make them sit, even if they're 10 or 12 there's still juiced up with life. And if you make them sit and just do things, they get fucking bored. And they know that what they're doing is not as fun as baseball. They know what they're doing is not as fun as the video game that they're addicted to. They know it's not as fun as playing with their friends when school's over so they can't wait to get the

Speaker 4:          00:47:30       fuck out of there. And then you say, well this boy has got a disease. Well, no they don't. You're, you're offering them shit sandwiches and they're not hungry. Yeah, no shit. I, and that's why I think it's a funny term, attention deficit disorder because these kids, there's no deficits in attention. There's uh, there's uh, maybe a, it's a attention control disorder in the sense that they can't control what they focus their mind on. I know I have an attention control this order because I can be sitting on my porch and then like look down at my phone and not look up for another 15 minutes. Okay, but stop right there because you don't, because if it's something that you really love, like starcraft, you can fucking lock on to that shit for hours. You can tune in with 100% of your being for hours. That's not an attention deficit disorder.

Speaker 4:          00:48:19       What you have is a love of starcraft, which you have is you find the one thing that you do just fucking really vibe on and you chase after that five on sounded very seventies. No, it's true. Mantle family on everybody. But I think that it's a, I, if I had my, if I could, I would much rather, and maybe this is an impossibility or fantasy, but I'd much rather have the ability to lock my attention on anything I wanted to with the exact same level that gets locked on to things that I enjoy. Because I think if I could do that, then I would be able to. Uh, but you can, if you actually enjoy it, if you actually enjoy it, you can. Yeah. But certain things like books, uh, like especially like really long novels. Like I'm just listening to the stand, the Stephen King audio, but Stan, or it's good, but I'll tell you the first like two hours, there's a lot of shit in there that doesn't involve people coughing up sprays of thick briny plague mucus and wandering through an apocalyptic wasteland.

Speaker 4:          00:49:26       There's just a lot of character development. That's not that fun, right? But you need, you need to focus on that because it brings the characters to life more a Kendall's the fire of the story. So it's like sir, you know, and also, uh, running, you know, and I go jogging the first 30 minutes or 20 minutes aren't exactly a blast. Like my mind is going everywhere. But then this thing will kick in where suddenly you're like, ah, this is fucking amazing. It feels so good. But to get there, you need to get through the first 30 minutes or however long of not enjoying it or fucking Jujitsu. And I was taking Jujitsu with Eddie Bravo, man, that wasn't my mind was everywhere. And like I know if I just had the ability to focus on that for a year, then that would have radically transformed my life. So that's why I say I wish that I could figure out a way to make my mind become immersed in anything that I want it to instead of what it wanted to get immersed in it. You still can, not only can you still

Speaker 5:          00:50:28       do it, you, you, what you described is the very difficult aspects of things that you really enjoy. It's a, a subset or a, another aspect of how you like find what you enjoy and make what you enjoy better. And that that involves doing things that you don't enjoy at all. It involves work. And that's the weird sort of thing that happens to kids when they learn a sport or they learn a martial art or you know, you, you try out for the wrestling team or something when you realize like, I love wrestling, but to get really good at wrestling, you gotta go through wrestling practice and that's a mother fucker. And that's like this thing that you learned in life. But you know, when you're dealing with something that you want to describe as attention deficit disorder, that I don't think that applies to that.

Speaker 5:          00:51:13       I think all that is, is a conditioning of discipline and a recognition that discipline is like a mode that you can put your mind into and that you can achieve. And it's also one of those things where if you, you have a characteristic that you cultivate on a regular basis, then it becomes a part of who you are. If you get used to, uh, an act, do you get used to have it? All you have to do is do something for 90 days and that will become who you are. You say, I'm going to take yoga every day for 90 days. It seems impossible. People had been doing it for years. You can do it. Just get up every morning at eight o'clock whenever the fuck the class is and take it for 90 days. You will be a fucking Yogi by the end of those 90 days.

Speaker 5:          00:51:55       That will be who you are, right? But how many people ever actually do that? That's the, the discipline that that life requires. And that's one of the lessons that you learn once you apply yourself to something. You learn how to develop your human potential. And one of the ways of developing is a force yourself into and through situations. But you're, you still love the things that you love, like video games, like doing standup comedy, things that don't require the discipline at all. You still pursue them and have this passion for them. It's just there's other stuff too that's not on the surface. You just have to work to get to it. Got To get good at Jujitsu. Fucking sucked when I first started doing it, but I knew that these guys were way better than me and they were an immortal. There were just people who practice more, right? So in getting killed, I realized, Ooh, if I just keep doing this, I can eventually do that to someone else. And when I first started playing quake, same thing. I was getting crushed. I would go online and spin around in circles and dude would shoot rockets into my face. It was a terrible feeling. And then I've learned how to get really good at it because

Speaker 4:          00:52:59       I know, yeah, same was star craft. Man tries starting that shit off, man. You'll get your ass handed to you. I still do. By the way, everybody starcraft people out there, I should make this very important announcement. This Friday at 1:00 PM I will be a live streaming, a match between me and Pendleton ward, the creator of adventure time. It was a play. Starcraft kicked my ass the last time we played. We're having a rematch and it's being cast by our tosas and Jeff Robinson who are these like professional starcraft casters and there's a caster. What does that mean? It's like what you do for the UFC, but they do it for Starrco, a broadcast, a broadcast. So when you're playing starcraft, they will do commentary on your strategy. And me and Pendleton suck so bad. So it'd be like you casting a UFC with, with like me to go in Ra fighting.

Speaker 4:          00:53:56       Yeah, it'd be, yeah. It's like just, we're not good at all, but it's cool to get these two like super professional casters to do it. So that's at 1:00 PM Pacific Time. I think it's going to be on twitch TV, but I'll tweet about it. For those of you who like star craft, you can watch us flail. Don't get an as eating, drinking the mountain dew and eating no Doritos. He's slowly, I could imagine a cat thing. I think that game is like one of those. I think starcraft, like you have to be on the ball all the time. Correct me if I'm wrong. You have to be the whole time. You can't be like eating chips, right? No, you can't eat fucking chips if you're, if you're going to play a real game of, sorry, you got to eat your cashews and drink your coke and then he start playing.

Speaker 4:          00:54:39       You might be able to take some swigs of water and the first four minutes or so when you're building up your army and your little circle, things are just beginning to grow, but you got ten six basically. It's all time, man. I'm not going to get an a starcraft. I was with Dunkin in Utah. We had a long drive to and from location. It was like two hours from the airport and we got into a starcraft conversation and the passion in his voice, when he describes starcraft, it's like, man, if you put that much effort into anything else in your life, it becomes, this is a real problem is that those things don't pay off. You know, they don't give you anything back. No, I get really awesome at them, but then at the end of the day you don't have a car. You don't have a house to show that you're the best tennis player.

Speaker 4:          00:55:27       No Man. Pete Sampras like that guy has a giant ass house. But like you know, if you become like the motherfucker had starcraft, how much can you make? What are the best pro star craft guys make $40 dude, I have no that. I think they make real money. I know they can make you can make real money. I think I'm wrong. If you go to team liquid, I, I've saw somewhere there was a listing of like how much like in fact when the Pete, when they, when players start playing in tournaments as part of their credits, they will show the amount of money that they've won over the course of their career play. Wow. So you could see how much money these people want, but it's look professional. Starcraft as a young man's game. This is for somebody who's neurology hasn't been frazzled by countless hits of LSD and nitrous oxide. It's like you've got to have like quick, quick fucking what's called APM, which is actions per minute. Will they love this stuff? By the way, Alpha brain would definitely go over well with some of these people who play the game. I play the game just for just for fun. I mean it's, but I do recognize the time suck that it is an inevitably when I'm playing, I'll look at my watch and think, why were you not writing for the last two hours? We just been running purple things all over a screen for two hours.

Speaker 5:          00:56:46       Doesn't do anything for you. It gets you, it does do something for, I shouldn't say that because it has been proven that it has a positive effect on cognitive function. Okay. It strengthens your, uh, strengthens your decision making abilities. Yeah. And it makes your brain fire at a rapid pace. They, for real, they've figured this out with video games, right? That you're dealing with intense series of things going on and you're managing them and it's like an exercise for your mind.

Speaker 4:          00:57:12       I just think it's a drug and I think that it's like some drugs have benefits and I think that it's a digital drug and I think that when you're, when you're playing so that, you know, when I'm playing a video game for a long time, uh, for a really long time, like if it's, when I was addicted to world of Warcraft, which I'd, I'm not anymore, I don't play anymore. But when I was due to the world of Warcraft, which was a true video game addiction, and I think about spending a couple of days playing that game is the main activity in my day. I don't really see much of a difference in physical activity between me and somebody who just got on the spike and shot some heroin into his veins. You know, I, he's going to be sitting on the couch nodding in and out. I'm going to be sitting on my chair focused on a fantasy world and clicking buttons.

Speaker 4:          00:58:03       But our caloric, we're not burning a lot of calories. We're just kind of sitting in a, in other words, if that team, if my monitor was turned off and I was just sitting there doing the same thing, I might as well be, it's like heroin, except that I don't have a chemical inside of me. So it's a drug, it's a fucking drug. And when the rift comes out, when these new oculus rift, yeah, man, when that shit comes out, people are going to have to accept the fact that we found another way to get high. That's as easy as addictive and potentially life destroying is any other hardcore narc.

Speaker 5:          00:58:38       Well, you keep hearing about these people that abandon their babies because they, uh, they've been playing a video game and they let their kids starve to death. You hear about that shit all the time. It's happened several times. And you know, these, these video games are only getting more and more powerful. So their impact, what you're getting now is way stronger than anybody ever got from monopoly and Pong. You know? And then when Pong became, you know, the PAC man, and then when pac man became, when you're dealing with now something that's way, way, way, way, way more powerful. And the question comes up is, are we really designed to handle that kind of stimulation? Right? Our brains are set up for a whole series of rewards that we get for finding food. You find a rabbit, you shoot it,

Speaker 4:          00:59:22       then you get to eat. You know, there's that thrill of catching it and eating it. Well, it said of rabbits, you're doing swords or whatever the fuck you're doing and you're serving your deserves. You're sending your troops over this three d mountain range. You know, you're setting a trap. On the other end and they retreat so you can attack from the back end as well. Yeah, it'd be evil, evil to touch it. I don't want to fuck with you. I love it man. That's exactly what you just described as a great strategy and that's part of the fun of the game is like you start learning new strategies. There's cheese strategies is what they're called, which is like leave out a trout when you attack within the first six minutes it's like, oh or four minutes. There's lane, it's lame and cheese is lame. So like Ah, there's, there's like some like you can, instead of spending your time building a giant army, if within the first five minutes you can build a very small army and get that into your enemies base, taking them by surprise and they haven't built up any defense, then you can sometimes defeat your enemy within the first five minutes of the game because they weren't prepared for what's called a rush.

Speaker 4:          01:00:23       And that's called a cheese attack and it pisses people off and it's so fun to Piss people off when you're playing. Cause then they'll chat to you like you fucking new piece of shit. What are you doing? Cause they get really mad cause it's lame cause it's just a lie. Is it lame though? It seems like it's an option. Well it's lame because it's, it's it and I used to not, I used to think, I used to think like you think and because I would love to do cheese attacks and I thought it was funny but you don't do it anymore. You want to be taken seriously. I don't want to be taking seriously. I enjoy the game more when I have bigger armies. It's more fun when you like have to deal with more variables and you let the thing expand to like the, the game is divided into phases.

Speaker 4:          01:01:02       So it's like mid game and game and the beginning of the game and each of these phases, there's different strategies that you employ according to what your enemies doing. It's kind of boring looking though, you know, I mean I won't argue with that. A little dudes are like, there are no big deal. They're not very distinctive. I like how they explode when you shoot out him and still back to that. What was that? So look what we have here is I can't, I can't see very well, it appears that we have Taryn, these are Terrans attacking. I can't tell what those fucking, they turn into like little red puddles, the explode when you shoot at some odd Dunkin Zombie Mod. Oh, it's a Zombie. Oh Wow. Starcraft Zombie mode. That looks fun. So that's Terrans attacking zombies. There are zombies that are actually in the game, but I've never seen those zombies before.

Speaker 4:          01:01:46       I wish it was um, more first person. I wish you have the opportunity to go first person and then above just for the visual enjoyment of it kind of cooler. Really cool. I keep praying that blizzard releases some version of it where each member of the armies can be somebody else playing like halo styles. So each of the armies are like each individual troop is being controlled by some other players somewhere else. Oh Wow. Fucking awesome. That be crazy. So you, you literally would be an army of people. How many people would you get it into a game then? Well, you, you can only get a maximum of 200 units, so or, or 200. Not 200 units, but it's like 200 supply is what it's called because for every, uh, every unit requires like for uh, the Zerg to create units. You, you'll Max out your unit.

Speaker 4:          01:02:36       So you start off, you can only have 10 units on the board and then you have to build a thing called an overlord. And for each overlord you get an, you can build another five units. So you could have a potentially 200 people as individuals. 200 different individuals logged into a server. Well it wouldn't be at 200, but it would be like, you could have like 130 or 150 or something because a certain units and anyway, it's like it would be fucking wild. It would be of 150 people online representing a team. I mean is that what's going to happen with oculus rifts? That seems like that would be totally possible, I think. I think that is going to happen with Oculus rift and I think that, uh, how many people are going to die having heart attacks play on that, playing that and probably not many, but oculus rift having sex.

Speaker 4:          01:03:17       But what about the running with the fucking running on the fucking Omni Directional treadmills? Yeah, on the Omni. Yeah. You're, no, you're right. I mean I think that's going to be one of the problems that we see is people are going to get sick and people are going to like go into cardiac arrest. People are going to have the most amazing legs ever. People are going to be ripped, but they're getting there. People are going to be using, this is something that uh, Silva was talking about and he had a word for like the mixture of certain psychedelics and video games. Silva who? Jason Silva, Jason Silva, he had this, uh, he was talking about some kind of mix of psychedelics and video games. So it's like not only are you going to be putting the rift on, but you're going to be taking some synthetic drug that helps you merge into the video game more so that you can merge into it more.

Speaker 4:          01:04:01       You get deeper into it. Maybe it'll just be marijuana bath salts, but you're going to smack that fucking riffed on man and I haven't seen much mention of of porn yet with the Oculus riff, but come on man. Think about first person porn. They film the first porn with the Google glass. Yeah, some guy film porn with Google glass. There you go, man. I don't think Jo would like starcraft. I think you'd be more like like a battlefield for battlefield. His battlefield where there's tons of people playing out. Well that's way better balance. You're in that direct. You're in three d like this so you can get in planes, you can get in tanks [inaudible] me. This to me speaks to me as like an individual, like as a human being, experiencing life. Like I know I'm just in a video game, but you're running around with a machine gun.

Speaker 4:          01:04:45       You're flying around in a plane, it's like you're seeing it from the point of view of an actual player when you're looking at it above. I'm sure it's really cool, but it lacks that feeling like it's actually happening. It's apples and oranges. It's, it's chess versus quake itself, a whole different thing. You're, you're controlling, you know, it's multitasking to the nth degree. Makes them with planning and mixed them with strategy, with these kinds of first person shooters. You're dealing with a whole different type of gameplay and there those are fucking fun, man. Let me, I was just telling Brian, I can wait for the new grand theft auto. Yeah. Wow. That looks amazing. And that's not even on the new generation of consoles, man. That's just a, that's a, uh, that's on the, we'll have access to that in a few months and it looks so fun and I, there's like a giant forest in it I've heard. And there's rumors that there's a big foot that lives in the floor. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:05:41       That's awesome. I know, man. I can't wait. Did you ever play quake, uh, like a dual? Did you ever do doubles with quake? Yeah, duals are fascinating because they got it down to when they know when weapons would respond. So the whole key to a duel was controlling the map. You had to know where the rocket launcher is. You got to get to the guy before the rocket launcher respond. You had to make sure that he never got a good weapon. So all you have is like a little blaster when you spawn. And then if somebody kills you and they're all armored up and they're filled with weapons, they can fuck you up. And the key is like you got to figure out a way to kill that guy while he's all armored up. It's very, very difficult and it becomes like this massive dual to get to various strong spots on the map. Where's the armor? Where's the the rail gun? Where's this? And where's that?

Speaker 4:          01:06:24       It's so fun. And it's so funny, the way to fun. Unfortunately, I, I'd actually deleted my fucking star craft so funny two nights ago to lead and stark. So many times I tried again. I deleted starcraft and then Pendleton texted me and he's like, uh, w w w I want to come over on Friday and kick your ass. It starcraft again. And then it's like, oh fuck you man, we'll play. Because I played Pendleton. I didn't know that he knew how to play. Oh, I got really cocky and was like being lazy and fucking around. And then he likes stomped my ass. He like crushed me and them in the most horrible way. So I wasn't prepared for that. I thought he was like, just, just a, just started playing. And you know what I think he had, that's a pathetic thing. That's how bad I suck.

Speaker 4:          01:07:10       It started just started playing and he got back. He's just really a really, really smart guy. I mean, have you seen adventure time? Yeah, it's genius. So when you do it, um, it's possible for someone to just learn like right away. No, not me. I, I'm, I've been playing now for like, you can learn the basics pretty few years and I just, I'm still on the silver league. The silver league. I just got out of the bronze league, which is the lowest league. It's just such a Dork. I gotta pee. I'll be right back. All right, sorry. Hey everybody. Hi.

Speaker 1:          01:07:43       I had a pizza, but I've been holding it in, but that's cool. You go and then we'll go. Have you seen this, um, this new campaign about pornography? They, somebody sent it to me on Twitter at pornography is the new drug. Like this is the new drug and that, and it's like fight, fight or blog. Like they're fighting pornography. It's like fight or blog and fighter. It's very odd. It's a w what are, what are they saying? Well, you know, they're essentially saying things that people have always said about pornography, that people get addicted to, that it can affect your relationships. And yet, Ken, with some people, but it's another one of those things. It's just like TV, booze, cigarettes, any it fill in the blank, right? It's like, yeah, yeah. You could just jerk off all day. And sometimes that happens to all of us for like a week, you know, especially when you're single, you know when you were single, like you could easily when you're live. But when I lived by myself and I was single, I can easily have jerked off twice a day for like a weekend in a row.

Speaker 7:          01:08:37       Yeah. The other day I, I I masturbated and then like I would like two minutes later I was like, oh, I'm in masturbating. I'm like, wait, I still have comm on my hands. Like I wasn't even like, like no time had passed. I was only a few minutes.

Speaker 1:          01:08:48       Yeah. People are weird. The weirdest fuck. And Yeah, when you get something like pornography where you could just watch people fucking get stimulated for short, you can get addicted to that. But does that mean that because you get addicted to it, it shouldn't be available to people that enjoy it? Does that mean, you know, does that mean that just because you think it dehumanizes people and objectifies people that everyone looks at it that way?

Speaker 7:          01:09:10       Is that it definitely is changing that the kids nowadays, Oh yeah. Like these girls, like, you know, I forget who, I think it was, Sarah Tiana has a bit about it where, where, you know, like the girls are growing up nowadays things, it's normal to get cummed on their face. So, you know what I mean? Like that's what you're supposed to do when you have sex, you know, or you're supposed to have a fist in your ass once in a while and, and all the cause the porn so shocking and crazy and he's like in, they're watching it at such a young age that, you know, usually back in the day you used to look at a playboy Django, the hacker has nice boobs. You're not seeing like crazy full on triple x porn back then and people are seeing it on the phone and they're in nursing. It's at a young age.

Speaker 1:          01:09:47       Yeah. It's almost like you can't stop it. Yeah. And you know, the other thing is how about grooming, grooming, the grooming, the pubic hair. Oh yeah. Porn one that porn won that battle. Okay. Everybody does it now. It's very rare that girls let their whole box get get crazy and France is going extinct actually because of that. That's, yeah. That's awesome. I'm going to pee now. Feel free to talk shit about me while I'm gone.

Speaker 4:          01:10:12       Isn't that amazing that crabs are going extinct? Yeah, that's weird. They're like the indigenous people and the rain forest that are getting wiped out. To think that we had something that you know is going to be extinct one day. Disney should do a cartoon about like a tribe of crabs living in the pubic hair or someone who's on the verge of shaving their her pussy and they've got to like convince her not to do it. Save it,

Speaker 7:          01:10:36       do I? I love it, man. I had this girl recently that had a bush and I forgot how nice it was to have a bush. You can just a little teeny Bush.

Speaker 4:          01:10:45       I get it. I mean I, if a girl wants to shave her pussy because it makes her feel better, I think it's good, but it's not something I really, I liked that much. I like it when there's some hair down there. I always just feel weird when they've, they've decided to take that leap because I mean if, if it makes them more comfortable, it makes sense. But if they're trying to appeal to some notion that that's what guys want, I think that could be a little off base. You know? I don't, I don't know that that's exactly the,

Speaker 7:          01:11:14       the thing that guys fantasize about, man, just a nice shave pussy, right. I, I've never gotten it. I've never, that's never been a thing that, it just made me feel like, wow, you're really committing to, to fucking right. I just recently started shaving my balls because Joe says that he shaves his balls and he'd be like, you know what? I've never really just like shaved him completely bald and so I did and it's so much nicer. When do you use just a razor? Put some soap on it or some shaving cream and I could Gillette sensor once I was trimming my pubes and I sliced a piece of my like Oh, skin with the scissors. It was really sad because like I was about to go on a date and I'm like, I got to trim this Bush. And I ended up like cutting a piece of my skin off. So it's like now if we end up having sex, she's gonna think I have some kind of soul. Never going to believe you either. I can't. Like I was trimming my cubes for you. I was so excited that I cut myself.

Speaker 1:          01:12:08       I caught my dick and a zipper once more than once, but once in a way that it left like a mark, like a little herpes mark or something. So painful. Yeah. Well, yeah, you got to wear underwear, you know? Yeah. You got it. One time I caught it with underwear and it was not that bad. I've, I've caught my dick so many times and a zipper. I can't even imagine if I had a countertop, I'd be so sad and I'll fucking stupid. I am. It's more than a dozen over my whole life, but one time it was bleeding. That's how Jay Dow Chase Algaes. Yeah, I could button flight. Nowadays, I hate zippers, but I'm flies a good move. I got a problem, man. I, I need to figure out better pants. I need to start wearing pants that are too big and then like get a belt that ties it down because when, when pants fit my waist, they don't fit my troll like thighs.

Speaker 1:          01:12:52       Well you just, you know, I mean, do you get straight leg? Do you get I get bought baggy ones then they're not baggy. They have to be like skateboarder baggy to be baggy on me. Like regular Levi five oh ones. Good fucking luck. Those I can't put those on. I can't even get those. I get those halfway up. My fine. They're stuck. I can't, I can't wear them. Like that's the regular jeans that guys are supposed to wear. I can't wear those. I guess. Can't you buy him big and just go to a tailor? I think I'm going to have to buy him the right length, but a wider waste just to see if they make the legs. They must make your legs bigger than they figure you're a fat fuck. Yeah. This, uh, I got a, I got a real problem with that though because on TV I look like I'm wearing girls jeans because my jeans, like they're tight on the top. Like I'm wearing skinny jeans. You can see my pack. It was just all bundled in there and talked.

Speaker 7:          01:13:39       There's this app called Tinder. Have you heard of the rent? No. No, I haven't heard of it. It's Tinder. Tinder is this thing where it, what it does, it's based on location and it will uh, it will pull up a girl's photo and it will say like, this girl is like block from you. And he say like, uh, like POW or like us thumbs up or thumbs down and you can like look through their photos and everything like that. But, uh, my friend Benji Afflalo, he found this like secret. So what we do is we just sit there as fast as we can and except, except, except, except don't even look at the foot cause you're like going through like millions of them and if they like you back, uh, it brings up a chat room. And this guy I know, he says that he's gone for the last six months. He's uh, gone on like 30 dates and about 90% of them he's fucked.

Speaker 5:          01:14:27       Yes man. I guys, that guy's on a rampage. Fuck me. And addicted to pornography. That's what he's doing. We were talking to when you went to p about there's a some new campaign called about pornography being the new drug and uh, I don't disagree, but I don't agree that you should stop it. I don't agree that you should tell people they can't do it. I don't agree that you can tell people they shouldn't watch it. I feel like it's like everything else, just like booze, just like cigarettes, just like coffee. You can, you can overdose on star Trek, starcraft. You can overdose and everything and you could overdose on porn or a regular person. I th I believe it's possible to watch, to jerk off, watch a little bit of porn and then go about your day. I know people that do that. I just know age, these fucking fundamentalist creeps would get there.

Speaker 5:          01:15:15       God Damn Morality and ethics and fear dynamics out of our orgasms. I don't think that this is a fundamentalist organization. I don't, I sound from what I looked maybe from what I looked though, it didn't reference religion at all. It seemed to be that was just there. You know, it was just a, uh, uh, an organization that thinks that pornography itself is detrimental to society and to relationships. And I could see how they would say that, but I say no. I say though, the behaviors of people that are addicted, those are the things that are detrimental to societies and those behaviors can manifest themselves in porn. They can also manifest themselves in gambling. They can manifest itself in a lot of different crazy things. People are fucking nuts. And the regular day to day job of no risk, no reward, that that pattern of life is not fucking rewarding. And because of that, people have these big, they'd go on these nutty Chase's often to the woods of craziness and they'll, they'll bet their entire house on a fucking hand of cards.

Speaker 5:          01:16:18       They'll still do nutty shit. That man, it's not always because of a mundane jobs, but there's a part of us, whatever it is, whatever is the cause of it. The point is there's a part of human beings that will just get obsessed with something and get crazy with something and just fucking along with it and then go, oh Jesus, what did I do? And it could be that with pornography I'm sure. But it could be that with almost anything. And if you looked at the amount of people that watch pornography and aren't crazy and don't objectify women because of it and aren't mean to people because of it and don't hate and don't want to rape and kill, I would have to assume that that's much larger. And there's also studies that show that people that are exposed to whether it's extreme like rough sex or, or, or different types of sex are different, different, you know, different sexual acts that it can ease their desire to perform those acts that it can actually like, especially like things like, like rough sex.

Speaker 5:          01:17:20       Like there's some people that have like fantasies about that they can watch it in a porn and never want to hit somebody. Right. And they think that it can act as, you know, it can have some sort of an alleviating effect. And I don't know if these studies are biased. I don't know if you know, they were, they went into it trying to prove something and if it's been rejected by science, but I know the argument is kind of strange that it has that sort of alleviating effect that has that sort of a release mechanism effect like violent movies. A lot of people feel the same way. I find it an incredibly strange that we have no problem with violent movies. There's very little blow back to these Batman movies. Zombie movies are all these different movies, but yet if there was that same type of extreme sexuality in a film, we would lose our fucking minds. Yeah. But it is an extreme violence just as disturbing, if not more disturbing than extreme sexuality.

Speaker 2:          01:18:13       Well, isn't it funny that the two even get put in the same goddamn category? Right. Did there even compared like one, you have like just pleasure seeking people, trying to reach a temporary utopian states, uh, by coming on the other, you have people actively killing each other and yet somehow people even bring those two together. It's like talking about dragons versus butterflies, like one just supposed to be fun, you know, and I think that's one of the, that that's one of the problems with this repressed sexual culture that we live in is that what ends up happening is people watch porn and what they're seeing a lot of times is the result of sexual repression. You know, when you get that creepy narrator, I'm sure we've talked about this before, but that guy who were like ruins the porn. You know what I'm talking about? The creepy narrator like, yes, Ooh, what do we have here? A little dirty girl. You dirty, you dirty, you want to suck.

Speaker 5:          01:19:03       He's known as the worst was when the camera man does it. The girls having sex with the guy and the camera has gone, Oh yeah, you want to suck his cock it all the way down. You're like, Hey, what's going on here? Who's that creep at the camera? You know that fucking Weirdo.

Speaker 2:          01:19:18       So fucking weird man. And it's like, Eh, the, the, the, that porn down, you know that thing? What is that? Where suddenly no, yeah, this is what we're doing.

Speaker 5:          01:19:28       And sometimes it's the girl too. Sometimes girls can be like, oh yeah, fucking baby. Oh yeah. And you're like, Hey Jesus, what's going on here? That thing. So all the screaming. Yeah. That thing, that thing is so weird. And that is just a result I think of sexual repression. Okay. I don't know about that. I think is to some guys, that's what they like to hear. Some guys want to hear that girl being all loud and obnoxious. Fuck my ass baby. And then some guys also want to hear the guy, you know, I think we saw the style. So everyone's wildly, everyone's got their own style. The point is, how weird are we were extreme violence is the expendables. It's everywhere

Speaker 4:          01:20:08       now. They shoot someone that had their fucking brain explodes. That's someone's baby. That guy just shot someone's baby that grew up in the head. And His fucking skull exploded and we accepted cause he's the bad guy. Right. You know, and w w w why is that acceptable? Why is that not just acceptable but barely criticized? Well it's because a long time ago some really fucked up dudes started controlling everything and it's been going on and on like that for a very long time. And we're the, we're the descendants of super sexually repressed fundamentalist religious fanatics who came over here to start Utopian societies and is part of their understanding of things. Decided that they were going to lock that pussy underneath a Bible. And that's what where we're at today. She's true, isn't it? That is what it is, isn't it? Yes. It's just a, it's just a, a really beautiful Massey act that's kind of embarrassing, but it's just ultimately fun and we've managed to turn it into a Goddamn multiside h p Lovecraft monster that you're not supposed to talk about.

Speaker 4:          01:21:14       Certainly never show it to your kids. Never want your kids to see sex ever. That's the worst thing. It's like the most we, it's just fucked up. It's like Nancy Grace Shit man. It's taking off. Did you hear about that? Yeah. Some guy was trying to kill Nancy grace. Yeah, with once at knives and stuff. What was he on his way to her house or something? I don't know. You Know Jamie? Yeah. Jamie. Well Poor Nancy grace. Are you all doing, are you allowed in bed? Am I loud in bed? Yeah. Do you make noises there? You the fuck are you, I don't want to know. It takes a little secret. I very, uh, very wildly like in all things. I do like to talk so that I can hear you. It depends on what kind of sex is happening. What kind of ball gag he's gotten. His mouth. It depends on outside. Did you guys see that? And Yoko Ono thing speaking a ball gag. I've seen that

Speaker 5:          01:22:06       new thing that she did. The, the, the sing, the cover of the Adele Song.

Speaker 4:          01:22:10       I saw that. That's kind of old. I've seen that.

Speaker 5:          01:22:12       How old is it? A Dell has only been around for a couple of years. I mean, I saw it like a year ago. 2012. Yeah. Pull it. Pull it up. Because this bears repeating for the fix for folks who haven't seen this in a home that's a kitty. She does this thing. I Dunno. I mean it's almost like now she's like heard the criticism. So she's just taken it to the next level and making it a joke. And so Yoko Ono is at this art gallery and uh, she pulls up this microphone. It's really, she's like really strange. Someone like you as the song and uh, she's dressed like real weird and people still sort of give her attention because she was John Lennon's wife and John Lennon was, you know, a motherfucker in his time. So she gets up to this microphone. So weird.

Speaker 8:          01:23:07       No,

Speaker 9:          01:23:14       and I'm sure most of the people in the crowd were like, what the fuck John Lennon, what did you do to us? Isn't it

Speaker 2:          01:23:26       kind of making fun of a doubt? I don't know. I think she be, cause that's kind of like, maybe that's her interpretation of modern music or something. Like she's like making fun of what she considers to be the empty, uh, emptiness.

Speaker 5:          01:23:40       Sir. The book. And you're looking into it too far, pal. This is why I say not because she never did anything good before that. It's not like she did something that was like really cool and interesting and then people really got into it and then she's doing this as a parody. No, this is what she's always done that, that thing

Speaker 2:          01:24:00       there, that law.

Speaker 5:          01:24:02       She's always done that like bill burr had this whole Clarius bit about Chuck Berry and John Lennon doing a solo together. They're a duo rather and there they're singing this song and you know John Lennon's they're singing and Yoko ono is like playing the, the fucking tambourine, the background and she just pulls up a microphone and goals.

Speaker 2:          01:24:20       Nah,

Speaker 5:          01:24:22       like she, she makes this crazy noise and like, and you could see the look on Chuck Berry's face. Like they've, whoever made the video of the bill birthing did an awesome job. He is it mischief maker? Did he make it? No. Some other dude, whoever made it, they froze frame. Right. When Chuck Berry had this crazy looking as I was like, yeah,

Speaker 2:          01:24:39       what the fuck the bitches do, man. I've noticed that there's people like that. He will attach themselves to things and ruin it. Like there's always a lot of times you'll find yourself around someone who's just going to squawk out some bullshit and ruin everything. Yeah, I would love to see that Brian.

Speaker 5:          01:24:55       Yeah, it's yet to see the bill version of it. Okay.

Speaker 10:         01:24:58       No, but anyway, she's up to playing the bongos. Right. So John Lennon, Chuck Berry, two of the greatest of all time harmonizing singing this hit from the 1950 [inaudible]. That's what this moment is about. And Yoko in the middle of it can't handle that. She's not getting any shine. She takes the fucking microphone out of the stands, starts playing the Bongo and as they're singing, you know, go, go Johnny go whatever. She picks up the mic and I swear to God goes, yeah, some fucking crazy shit.

Speaker 2:          01:25:30       Fucking open as wide as they are in that fucking, what did he do? What is it

Speaker 5:          01:25:41       bout the some dudes like a John Lennon type guide that seems by all accounts to be like one of the coolest people that's ever lived. This brilliant artist, these amazing songs, this great way of looking at life. And then he has this really weird way

Speaker 2:          01:25:56       Asian fetish man back then it wasn't that common to have an Asian girlfriend. Right.

Speaker 5:          01:26:01       I think it was also who she was. I think some women will provide, they will provide like a guidance thing to some guys like Ozzy Osborne's wife, obviously a very strong woman, very opinionated, successful business woman and she takes care of one of the craziest guys in rock and roll. That's why that show was so interesting because you've got this guy that's like eating pigeons heads on stage. He's a fucking animal. He's done every drug known to man. He goes on stage and kids go fucking crazy. It's fucking awesome. He represents the ANC asked of every fucked up kid. He's God Damn Ozzy Osborne, you know, and he's singing crazy train and everybody's going nuts. And then he's got this wife who's like on the ball taking care of shit, putting things in line, managing his career, make sure he gets paid. Let's with, we're going to do a reality show, honey, you know, and all of a sudden a whole reality check and he's running around.

Speaker 5:          01:26:54       He's barely talk, he's going to fucking reality show his wife and his kids are getting all the attention because I mean, well not all the attention, but I mean he's, he's, it's almost impossible to understand them, but they find this and hit, in his case, it was a positive, you know, he found this woman who was like really on the ball, but in John Lennon's case, not, he just found this woman who just said, come here, hold my hand, I'll take this, I got this. And she just, I've seen it happen. I've seen it happen with comics. Have you ever met a comic and a, they have a girlfriend that sort of running the show? Kristina Brzezinski Thompson girls, Polaris. That's, that's a bad one. But I had a friend back in the day, he, sadly, he's passed. Um, but he had a girlfriend and his girlfriend was, you know, sort of like his manager type situation.

Speaker 5:          01:27:39       Just running the show. Like, you know, deciding what he does, what he doesn't do and they get, you know, they get linked up together and it gets, it gets weird. It's like they become a package deal. Like every time you're around Mike, you're also around sending like, oh Jesus, here we go. Or they'll start sharing emails. Yes. Oh, that's a big one. That's a big one. Where they have the same email account. Yeah. He may even the wife have the same meal. Okay. Dude, I'm not trying, I don't know your wife. We're not friends. Okay. I'm trying to send you an email. Do you have your own email so we can talk shit and I can maybe send you a porn link and not, and not have to deal with your wife going, hey, that's a shared email account and an appreciate you sending him all your bullshit.

Speaker 5:          01:28:17       Every time you call they're on fucking speaker. Oh, that's bad. Yeah, that's bad. Or how about when the woman answers the phone and it's his cell phone? Yeah. You know, you're like, hello. I thought I was calling Mike. Oh, who is this? Is Mike there? Yeah. Who is this please? Like, oh Jesus. Like you know, not even famous people. Uh, this is Cho. Can I talk to, and then you like, dude, why is your girlfriend answer your phone? Oh Hey, I don't care. You know, it's no big deal. It's just laying around like that person is like controlling your environment. So weird. Isn't it so weird? So it's weird. It's just as weird if a guy does it. If the girl's phone's ringing the cruiser. Hello, Debbie. Oh yeah, I'll get her old army. I ate Joe. I hate that. Sloan you to talk to Debbie.

Speaker 5:          01:29:04       So creepy man. When people try to control each other like that, it's so spooky, isn't it? It is spooky. It's dangerous too. It's tricky. It's dangerous. You got to just know when someone really likes you and if they don't like you either find someone that does or figuring out what's wrong with yourself. If you don't, you're going to get in that cycle of, I'd like that girl that I dated that went through my phone and it took screenshots of every single text I did the hook, every photo that I had in there and send it to herself. Like, like pretty much spent four hours while I was sleeping in bed, just going through my phone and making copies of everything. Well that's obviously a person that thought you were doing something different than what you were doing. She just decided that she had the right to do that.

Speaker 5:          01:29:44       You know, have the right to do that to people. Don't, you know, and that's one of the weirdest things about, to become the NSA. You don't have the right to go through someone's phone. I mean, if someone's lying to you, yeah, that sucks. It sucks that someone lied to you, but you know what sucks just as bad. Are you going through their fucking phone? That's, that's uh, I mean, finding out that someone betrayed you by betraying them, nobody wins there. You know, that's not a win. And it's certainly not a win if you're using it to, to fuck. It's like people need to figure out a way to just get along better. I don't know what it is. I don't know how, how you eliminate the 50% plus divorce rate that we have in this country. I don't know how you get it so that people can figure out how to not be that person, not be the woman, not be the man.

Speaker 5:          01:30:29       Not me the problem, but fuck. It's so, it's so hard to do. Yeah, you got to let go, man. You just got to let go. I mean, you got to let go. It's, if somebody is going to leave you, they're going to leave you. Well, it's not just that it's you gotta let go while you're with them too. That's what I mean. I'm saying like going through, by the time it gets to the point where you're going through somebody emails to see if they're cheating on you, that fucking, that ship has left the port. It's over. Whether they're cheating on you or not. You guys are so unconnected that you don't know what they're doing. Well, you never know what someone's doing and now you don't trust what they're doing. Right. You're still on connected. Did you hear about that guy that disappeared for 22 years or I think it was 19 years, something like that.

Speaker 5:          01:31:12       Long ass time. His family assumed he was dead. They had five children. They got a life insurance policy, $800,000 and it turns out he was living with his gay lover in Palm Springs. Wow. Talking to you tweeting right now. You're not really hearing I'm sculpting. Joe. When he squeezed, it's called thing. Played Out. What's wrong with this guy? Like he was a deeply religious guy and just couldn't deal with his sexuality. It was just too crazy for him. He couldn't handle it and then he went crazy. He went on a vacation and just never came home. He just moved in with this gay guy and just starts sucking cock and taking the but and then just loved it. Just like this is the place for me. So much so that he abandoned his children and now his children, like they were eight at the time. Now they're grown.

Speaker 5:          01:31:57       Like one of them was a grown woman and she has children of her own and she's like, I would never do that to my kids. Like he doesn't understand like he left when I was eight. That was devastating to lose your father when you're eight just because you know you can't come out of the closet. So you go and you never come back for like x amount of years, 1516 whatever the fuck years it was. And then finally do come back and like, look, I fucked up. Like wow, people can do that too. But that's one of those things you've got to realize like we're crazy. We can, that's, that's also in the wheel house of human behavior. It is. Ukie I mean that's the trick I think of relationships. It's just you gotta be in, you have all kinds of things. You've got to be in the moment with the relationships.

Speaker 5:          01:32:38       If you start holding onto the idea that that shit's going to last forever, you're, you'll start going crazy. That, that, that's never the case. It's just never the case. You have to appreciate the moments that are good and then the moments that aren't so good, you've got to trust that things are going to get better. Yeah. And you've got to have a support system. You got to have some exercise in your life to blow out the fucking bad hormones can have a lot of shit going on. And we're not told this. You got to figure it out over stumbling through your life, running in the wall. This is the question I have for you. It's something I've been thinking about. Men in a relationship is a great way to bring it up. Okay.

Speaker 5:          01:33:18       If you don't feel loving towards someone, if you don't feel it, and that quite often happens in relationships where you just not feeling it right. How were you supposed to act? In other words, you can't, if you're not feeling it and you start acting like you're feeling it, aren't you being dishonest or phony? Hmm. Well, you have to. That's a really, that's a giant general question and that's the problem because it really depends entirely on the moment. It depends entirely on you that person. The variables are so vast. The variables of of people, the variables of scenarios, the variables of lifestyle, the variables of culture, the veil variables of what part of the world you're living in. There's a lot of variables when you're going to answer that question and it's like, why do you know you're not loving what that person who have fucked, I don't know your situation and to find out your situation would take a long time. I would have to have a definitely deeply delve into each one of your individual lives and they wake up in the morning, you're a little hung over. I'm not even talking about relationships. You go to work, you feel like shit. You don't feel kind, empathetic, compassionate at all. You don't want to listen to anybody. Yap.

Speaker 11:         01:34:31       Okay.

Speaker 5:          01:34:32       Are you faking it? If you start acting kind to the people around you, what's better to follow that feeling and just be kind of like closed off or to try to act as though you're happy. Are you care about the people around you? Well that's a different scenario and that scenario, I feel like you have an obligation to be kind to the people that are around you as much as is humanly possible without compromising your own sanity, without, you know, getting to the point where someone's taking advantage of you being kind and they're just ruining your life and acting like a shithead all time and you're like, hey dickhead, how about pay attention to yourself? How about you not do that? How about you not spew out every stupid thought that comes out of your fucking mouth that ruins everybody else's conversation because you're doing something really selfish, right?

Speaker 5:          01:35:15       Sometimes you have to do that. Sometimes you have to regulate. But other than that, like if you go into work hung over, that's on you bitch. All right. Be Nice to everybody and you as a human being, you should do it because you want to do it. And if you think, I don't want to do it, you're in the wrong frame of mind, period. And that's not a generalization. And that type of a scenario, what I thought you were talking about was inside the confines of a relationship. And if you don't feel loving to someone inside the confines of a relationship, well you know, there's so many possible variables, but I ultimately think if you're, if you're a balanced person, if you're, if you are at least in the mode of balance, like trying to attempt to achieve balance, you should go with your instincts. And if this is not the person for you, this is not the person for you. Right. You know?

Speaker 2:          01:35:59       Yeah, no, I'm in, I just was using that cause we were talking about it. I just mean in general,

Speaker 5:          01:36:03       you know, there's the prescription, uh, you know, you'll just be nice even if you don't feel it. Yeah, you can be nice. You can be nice. You mean you get sometimes get upset, you know, sometimes you know, just like, oh look, I'm sorry man, I just fucking, today's crazy with me. But you know, unless they're doing something to you, be nice. It's not their fault that you're hung over some, their fault that you're troubled. It's not their fault, you know, as long as they're not like interfering with your ex, as long as they're not being rude or disrespectful to your own space. You know, we have all been there before. Like if you come to me and you're like, dude, I'm sorry I'm just in a shitty mood, but hey, no worry about a man who loves to talk. Just chill, relax. Like that's one thing about guys to like say if you and I were in a car. Okay. And you like to a man, I just don't, I really, I don't want to talk. I just want to sit. I'll be like, I get it. No worries. Just chill. Like you can do that. But yeah. Well if, if a guy and a girl are together and the guy's like, look, I just don't want to fucking talk. I just like, you know, within 10 minutes like, okay, what's wrong? You can tell me what's wrong. What is it?

Speaker 2:          01:37:02       It's such a problem, man. It's such a problem cause cause like I like to be quiet sometimes. Like I like to just have moments of quiet and stuff and it really is tough because sometimes it feels like girls translate that quiet into exactly what you're saying. And it's a real problem.

Speaker 5:          01:37:20       Well men and women are so fucking radically different as human beings with the hormone levels, the, the, the life experiences, the goals and dreams and the fact that men want to fuck women. And the fact that women are willing to let men fuck them. It's like all of it is so bizarre. There were so radically divided in like who we are and then yet we love each other and yet we're constantly around each other. And if you're in a, a relationship that you know is that you really enjoy and is really serious, you're around them all the time. Like most of the day on a regular basis. You know? And it's strange. It's a Greg Fitzsimmons is a fucking great bit about it where he talks about like if I had to choose to be with one person on an island for the rest of my life, he goes, if it was you or my wife, I'd be like, sorry honey, I'm going to live with Joe on an island.

Speaker 5:          01:38:10       It's like he goes, cause we're going to have fun. He goes, when was the last time you went to, I'm going to have a great conversation with my wife. He's like, that doesn't fucking happen. He's like, he goes, yeah, I love her. Yeah, we have children together, but I'm hanging out with my friend. He goes, yeah, we're not going to get any sex but so what? We'll just go jerk off in the bushes. Then we'll make each other laugh or the rest of the day and, and you know that's because we are, we're we're men and we understand men. And that's why when women get together and they tell jokes about purses and shoes and what a fucking 50 shades of grey or whatever the fuck they're into, whatever their, their, their style of person is into, you know, whether it's whatever, feminist jokes, whatever, they get together and they laugh at the shit that they think is funny.

Speaker 5:          01:38:53       And if you were there, you'd be like, Oh fucking Christ. But for them it's so awesome. They're laughing, they're lol in and they're saying stupid shit to each other that they like to hear. Why? Because they don't have estrogen or they don't have testosterone. Rather they have estrogen, they have ovaries, they don't have a penis, they have a vagina, they have totally different setup. It's a different animal. It's a totally different thing. So for you to try to become what she wants you to be, that's madness. And for you to want her to become what you want her to be like, that's madness too. Like you got to figure out what each other is and just sort of accept it. And as soon as you don't do that, you're fucked. You're fucked. It's, you're just going to fucking hit the rocks. It's not gonna last.

Speaker 5:          01:39:34       It's gonna fall apart. You're closing your eyes and hitting the gas and one day eventually going to hit something. It's not gonna work. All right. Yeah, it's true. So when someone's going through your fucking emails and checking your text messages and sending all that shit to themselves, that's not, it's never going to work. It's never going to work for all the raw what? You don't know, he's crazy, right? You don't know Brian red bands a freak and you're not paying attention, right. How are you not paying attention? Did you not know this guy? I know this guy. You know I don't have to look at his phone. I know him. You know, it's like you, we were so radically different though that that is a lesson that's so easily said and so impossible to absorb. And then it doesn't help that if you tune into the view, you know, and they're all going, oh no girl, he needs to give you his phone.

Speaker 5:          01:40:18       You need to take that phone. You need to be able to look at that phone anytime of day, whatever you want, you need to be able to do that. Pornography is just as bad as cheating. I've heard that. I've heard that there was an argument that was on the, uh, the fight porn website though a woman was saying that porn was watching. Porn is just as bad as cheating, but just crazy talk, you know, it's there. We just, we're just weird. It's totally different at Muskrat's in Unicode, he's dating a girl once, a long time ago and I made the mistake of leaving porn up on the computer and leaving and like, she came in and saw whatever porn website add

Speaker 4:          01:40:54       up in my apartment. I don't remember why she's going into my apartment, but I remember coming home, I guess I told her to meet me there or something. I don't have American coming home. She's sitting on my bed and she's in tears and she's like, is this who you are?

Speaker 2:          01:41:07       This is what you like. You like jerking off to this shit. I'm not good enough for you. It was shocking because I, at that time I didn't

Speaker 4:          01:41:17       realize it. That was some women, wait, I associated my four minutes or five minutes of lubing up my hand and jerking off to some random gay porn clip is like something, um, something offensive. Yeah. I didn't cause it's such a small little, it's such a small little thing. That's what you failed to mention though. It was gay porn. That's why she was pissed off. Wow. Wow. Yeah. I would, I date with a girl whose mom is I older than, or younger than me. Oh, Christ. He's there any booze in here, man. Can we get a drink? Yeah, I have ice. Uh, no. Yeah. Was it was nine, 925. It's not going to start until 10 o'clock. Um, we're at the Ice House tonight, folks. If you have an a, if you're in the neighborhood and you haven't made plans for the evening, hey dude, did you happen to get ice? Did you show, did you see that fucking Pacific rim?

Speaker 1:          01:42:11       Uh, no, I didn't. Did you? Yeah, you did see it. We were talking about it the other day.

Speaker 4:          01:42:15       Oh, ugh. Ugh, oh my fucking God, man. So really add, it's visually really cool, but the characters are, I tweeted that in like it and caught a lot of flack from really people who like robots and Godzillas and they're like Gluco. Have you ever seen a Godzilla movie? You expect that to have good characters and it's like, come on you. Just because it's got fantasy beings in it doesn't mean it can't be good.

Speaker 1:          01:42:41       Right? There's a lot of fantasy beings movies that are awesome. You know, even simple ones like you didn't like Avatar though.

Speaker 4:          01:42:49       Avatar I liked better than I liked. I see. I made it through Avatar. I didn't make it through Pacific rim. I laughed really 40 minutes in. Oh my God, I can't believe that bored out of my fucking mind.

Speaker 1:          01:43:01       That's amazing. And this is a Benicio del Toro or a not be so the Torah,

Speaker 4:          01:43:06       one of those things where he presents it. I don't know if he did, if it was, I'm not positive about that, but he did the same thing with Mama where it's like Guillermo del Toro presents. Mama do you just like, it's attaches a name to it. I mean, I would, I would not go see Pacific rim. I would go see that movie that's coming out this Friday about the, the new, um, what's his name? The guy or did grizzly man. Oh yeah, yeah. Werner Herzog. Yeah. He's putting out a movie called the act of killing.

Speaker 11:         01:43:34       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:43:35       Oh, I heard about. Very disturbing. I heard it's, it's a disturbing and I heard it's brilliant. Yeah. His stuff is always brilliant. So one thing that I didn't connect with with him is that cave, uh, the, the movie about the Cave Art.

Speaker 11:         01:43:49       Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:43:49       Oh yeah. Cave of forgotten dreams.

Speaker 5:          01:43:51       It didn't, for whatever reason, I didn't really, I dunno. I didn't enjoy that. That's a snoozer dude. That one. Yeah. Knocks your ass out. Yeah. I don't know. I don't know why everybody liked that one. I was watching that one. I was like, hmm. I don't, there's nothing there for me. But um, I love the happy people. I told you about that one life on the taiga about all these people that live in Siberia and their trappers and, and fishermen. And hunters and they're just so happy. They're all like dancing and hugging each other and you know, they're living off the land and, and teaching each other how to, uh, how to survive this. It's really a, it's an amazing movie. Yeah. He's a genius man. Yeah. He's a bad motherfucker. And also I heard black fish is really good too. What's blackfish? Black fishes a, I think it's called black fish. It's about seaworld and it's about the way they kidnap orcas and bring them in and how the work is like,

Speaker 4:          01:44:38       you know, every once in a while the oracle will like grab one by the arm or kill one of them got killed. An orca killed one of them, but you know, it's the, these are super intelligent beings that you're keeping in a swimming pool, swimming pool basically. And it's just torture and a hellish exists

Speaker 5:          01:44:54       stents for them and, yeah. And they're like, what? Oh, I can't understand you. I guess you're going to have to keep doing tricks if you want fish. Yeah. Do you want this fish? Okay. You know what I want from you? I want you to flip out of here. I don't know what you're saying. Do you want the fish? You have to flip? Uh, yeah. I know they sound of the dolphins can, will they believe rather than the dolphins have names,

Speaker 4:          01:45:14       names for each other? Yes. Yeah. It's so cool and I'm sure orcas do too. I bet. Yeah. There they killed off ones though. They call them non human people in India. That's what they've started calling them as non human people.

Speaker 5:          01:45:26       Yeah, they're, it's, it's really obvious. They're smartest shit. There's no way that they should be in swimming pools. That's it.

Speaker 4:          01:45:32       So horrific. Did you see that woman in front of the Dolphin? A aquarium doing back flips for them and they stopped to watch her and it's like they're really into watching it. They bought two of them are his sort of sitting there watching. One of them seems to be like grinning. It seems like they're really smiling like they think it's funny or weird. Have you seen when they look in the mirror, have you seen those videos? Yeah. Yeah. That's amazing. They like pose and like they like they really are into them.

Speaker 5:          01:45:59       They're very aware of what they are. Yeah, and I think it's cool to them to see themselves. Like they don't get to see that on the ocean ever. So all of a sudden they have a mirror. It's gotta be a weird thing to have that sort of branch of development where they are. Cerebral cortex is very evolved. They have this very complex language dialects and so complex and so different from ours that we don't understand it. We are trying to pick out patterns and bits and pieces, but as far as anyone been able to translate dolphin until like a code that you could read as English text, no one's been able to do that. They can't do it, but yet they understand what you're saying when you say, hey, you want a piece of fish, you want to be some fish, do your flip. And they'll do the flip. Like they know what you're saying. They, they, they, they can understand what you're saying but we don't understand what they're saying. It's really kind of interesting.

Speaker 4:          01:46:47       It's fascinating, man. I think a lot of what they're doing, I saw some documentary on them. I wish I remember what it was, but it's how their languages, a lot of it's movement too. It's not just the sounds they're making, but on top of it as the movements that they're making with the sound. And it's also a relational to the, to, it's like a more of a dance that they're doing with, what do you call it, a pack of dolphins. What do you call it? I think as a pack. Yeah. I, it's like more, it's, it's like they have more of a unified consciousness than human beings do. They're more of one thing. And so the communication is something that's not as much based on school of Dolphins, a school, a pod, pod, pod, and you go, yeah, a plurality of why

Speaker 5:          01:47:27       they move in very strange ways together like that. That is kind of cool. And they also, they, they're, they're capable of using sound to like to like measure where they're at and their distances from each other. Yeah. You know, their, their languages are really incredibly evolved and complex and they're really beautiful. And the fact that they're like very friendly to human beings and they're playful with human beings. But what's really freaky is there a rude as shit to each other regularly rape. Like they have these rape caves where they'll tuck a female dolphin in and just fucking rape raper forever. They kill babies on a regular basis. And then Orca is were killed dolphins or cause we're talking, we'll target dolphins and killed that often talk. Yeah, we were talking about, they found that dolphins can, um, they have names for each other. Yeah,

Speaker 4:          01:48:16       I know. It's craziness to, did you see that cartoon? Someone did scientifically accurate. Ducktails well, you know Brian [inaudible] it's like duck tales, but the way ducks really are that cartoon ducktails remember duck. That's so cool. Yeah, it's so true. It's really violent. And this in it. Funny and disturbing. Is it violent? Well, ducks ducks are violent. Like all creatures are kind of fucked up. I mean all creatures are not like innocent and it's interesting, but ducks, ducks rape to Jamie

Speaker 5:          01:48:48       glasses over there, right behind your butt or those dirty glasses or clean glasses think they're clean. Likud tell me what's up. Don't look good. Those look like clean glasses. Yeah. Yeah. Bring those bitches over. You've got some ice scientific scientifically. I think what they're doing right now with the, with zoos and dolphins, I think this is the last generation that does that. That's my prediction. My prediction is that they're going to realize in a few years that what they're doing is, is really evil. It's evil and it's unnecessary and they're not allowed to do it anymore. The United States is not allowed to kidnap dolphins and take orchids from their families. They're not allowed to do it anymore, so they have to be bred in captivity or they have some other, like they're, they're realizing, oh, this is the sign

Speaker 3:          01:49:31       talk. Just going over our debt profile and another duck ran over his fucking, the dead stuck dumping piles. Beds. Why does don't lie pants and they're shitting their pants? Male ducks.

Speaker 1:          01:49:49       I wonder if, uh, various feminist movements have gotten a hold of this making fun of rape because this is spread rate. It's just quite rude. I think this is rape culture. I am not. I'm going to be awareness about the fact that ducks are raping each other and that it should be stopped. Oh that's cool. You're cool man. Thank you. It seems like a, I mean the way this is this happening, it's almost like a rape apologist video. That's where they had a woman do it. Well one, you know she's like the uncle Tom of the feminist. She sang it. She sang it. It's not a man. Ducks rape. Can't believe you said that again. You what do you, what about trigger alert people to rape.

Speaker 1:          01:50:30       Why is that? Why the rave culture man? I like. What are you, what's your favorite part about rape culture? Ah, that paintings the, the way the guys breath smells. I like going down. Yeah. No I liked the symphonies. It's like, it's funny how that culture, I'll have a tiny bit please there. You could. Tiny bit the culture there. Well the idea of calling it like rape culture, that's a, some people protest that because when you put something into that sort of a box like oh it's rape culture. Well then what is there a murder culture? Cause they're Kinda is right. There's a gun culture whenever you want to like define something as being negative, you call it a culture that Paul was about full. Thank you. What are we drinking here? I don't know. That's a company who gave that to us. I think somebody gave us that whiskey while ago.

Speaker 1:          01:51:18       Um, I think this might've been the Armenians. We got this Ronda Rousey. You want some? Oh No, I'm good. Still drunk. You're still drunk. How dare you. Brian's live in the crazy rock and roll life. He really is. I really caught up to him like over the last couple of years, like if you follow his Instagram or his Twitter while you guys were in saying when they were in San Diego for comicon it's all just drunken rampages and girls sticking their butts out. The whole thing was a mess. That was so much fun man. Comic con you ever been to comic con? I will do. One time I even went down there was with you is when we did shows last year at American comedy club, but I didn't go to the comic con thing at all. It's too chaotic.

Speaker 7:          01:51:56       Well, like the guy from breaking bad, uh, he wore a mask of them. It leads guy wore a mask of his character so nobody would know who he is. Yeah. And it was like a super realistic mask was kind of like mission impossible mass. So he's like walking around and was like, oh, can I get a picture with you? He's like, yeah, you against dope. And then, uh, uh, when they had the, the panel, they called his name and he came up out of the audience and, and he sat down and was like, what the fuck? Who, who's this weird guy with the mask on? And he just takes off his mask and it's so weird cause he's like taking off his own face.

Speaker 1:          01:52:25       Oh yeah. Maybe I'll go next year. Yeah. And check it out. It seems like something you have to do. I heard Patton Patent recorded his, uh, his comedy special there.

Speaker 7:          01:52:37       You did, dude. I seriously, I went to me and jam band wouldn't, it wasn't yo Benji. Uh, like we went from the beginning of the line and walk to see how far

Speaker 1:          01:52:46       it went and went around the whole entire place. Went down the street around this other building a down this other street. Like it was the longest line I've ever seen for standup comedy or was the venue, what was the venue? It was a, it was a theater that was down the street, like a big theater. I don't know, but it was, uh, it was the one that I did last time. Did you go with, I didn't know the last time. Now it's San Diego's bad ass. I like it a lot. There's a lot of great spots. I forget what the Pandora, I want to say I did the Pandora. Yeah. Think that's it. Yeah. It's a beautiful theater too. It's pretty dope. Yeah. There's a, there's a house of blues there that's a great place to perform American comedy company. Like it used to be that there was no comedy clubs in San Diego.

Speaker 1:          01:53:23       There's today there's mad house right down the street from that House and American comedy company together. And then there's the theaters to, we used to be the San Diego had La Hoya. They had the comedy store and that was it. But now it's like this, like a genuine comedy community down there. Yeah. Fucking love it down there. I love that. It's a comedy club too, right next to Mexico. American comedy companies grade. Go to asco. Uh, no, but Yoshi almost was it Yoshi? Yoshi almost talked me into it because I guess people are saying that it's not as bad as everyone is saying. Like right when you go over, you just get an attack, seek tell him to take you to this one place and like there's like 200 hookers and you just pick which ones do you want out? Dude, let me just before anything on my show, I was interviewing a disease specialists.

Speaker 1:          01:54:05       Right? I interviewed some new guy who scared the fucking shit out of me. Oh, there's a new form of gonorrhea that they cannot cure the Philippines. They're finding it in Southeast Asia and this, this, this form of gonorrhea. Okay. That's the warning shot folks. It's making its way over here and you can't cure it and it kills a lot of people. Good luck. So you just have like Green Shit coming out of your Dick for life. I don't know. I don't know what happens. It's good question. Rots off. Falls off it. Yeah. I don't know what happens. I really don't know what happens when someone says he can't cure gonorrhea. That ain't good. That can't be good. That's not good. No, that's fucked up. That's scary. One of the things about the show that's been fucking terrifying is talking to disease specialists. Dunkin and I went to Galveston, Texas and we went to this level four lab, which is like the highest level.

Speaker 1:          01:54:52       That's like where they deal with like Ebola and like, you know hemorrhagic viruses that those hemorrhagic flus, they tear apart your body and you just bleed out of every hole and you turn into mush. Dude, I was scared to go. I was scared to go and Duncan and I missed our flight. So we went, we had like zero hour sleep the next day we slept for one hour flight. Like just from talking just from I think what, where we weren't even stoned now. We were just having fun talking. We're just laughing at the airport, at the airport, the airport, drinking beer and eating pizza and talking and then we like casually forget that there's a time that flight's happen. Well I was wrong. I thought it was 20 minutes later than it was and they, it was 10 minutes before the flight they had locked the doors and I was like, oh no. Like why can, why don't you let us on? Like we've already locked door. I go, but it's right there. You can't let us on. Like

Speaker 5:          01:55:44       is it that really that hard to open the door? I'm not a terrorist.

Speaker 4:          01:55:46       I didn't like call your name over the intercoms or maybe they did man. I don't think so. Cause he had to take a tram to this.

Speaker 5:          01:55:51       Yeah it was, it was a, this was a crafty situation. But the bottom line is Dunkin and I, we waited at the airport and then we flew there and then we went from there with no sleep, got some coffee and went to meet this disease specialist at this creepy fucking lab where they keep, you know, rabies,

Speaker 4:          01:56:06       this is, uh, this lab is a, this, this lab is straight out of every movie where like a plague starts. It's the, it's like guarded, it's you and it's got an, uh, an outside shell around it. It's got a shell that's basically around another building that has within it different security levels. And in the deepest security levels, that's where they keep the hemorrhagic fever. That's where they keep the Bulla forefoot

Speaker 5:          01:56:33       six cement walls and the whole deal half of filters. Yeah, it was really, they showed us the filtration system. I mean they really have it locked down, but it's in Galveston, Texas and it's word tornadoes. Hurricanes hit like right next to the ocean and they, they, it's like all the good shit is way up high. So if the water comes in, theoretically the water will never reach the areas where the uh, the diseases are. Wow. But it's just, oh, it's so crazy. Like when you really stop and think about what a, what a gamble that is like Montana used to be underwater. Did you, did you know that like the whole fucking thing? He used to be under the great western inland sea, so they're just banking that Galveston is going to stay above ground. Like what, what if a massive shift in the, in the earth's cross happens if there's a giant earthquake right off the coast, guess what? That fucker's underwater now. Yup. I get how, how well do you have that locked down? They claim they claim is totally locked down completely.

Speaker 4:          01:57:30       I was thinking about it and I was, you know, thinking of like the outrage of the light and the Hubris and all that of having like a zoo of deadly viruses. But then what freaked me out even more as I realize that's necessary, we need that because of the gonorrhea that you're talking about and all the countless other things that are happening all over the planet all the time. That's some of that is definitely the thing that creeped me out the most doing this show was a bio at the bar by apocalypse. Yeah. That shit is real and scary and provable and a matter of time and when you see the look on these people's faces, they look like people with a burden. There are people who are operating under the burden of the knowledge that it's only a matter of time before the right duck shit and the right farm yard and the right kid eats that duct meat and that kid sneezes on the right person and 20 million people die. It's only a matter of time. It's like the earthquake that's going to come to la. Like it's not a matter of if, but when, and these people are desperately trying to understand how to create vaccines for shit that maybe doesn't even exist yet. That's scary man. Well there, they've got ahold of it

Speaker 5:          01:58:50       so far. What's really, it's it, it is scary, but it's also really incredibly fascinating that we're, our bodies are essentially ecosystems that we're not just a person. You're a whole bunch of different life forms coexisting together. Yeah. And there there's more bacteria cells in your body than there are human cells. Yeah. Like did the whole thing is it's a mass, a mass of life. There's e coli and all this different flora that lives on your skin. And that's one of the reasons why probiotics. So I always see me drinking Kombucha. I drink this stuff every day or drinking like crazy and I never get sick. Build your immune system as well. It doesn't just build your immune system. It actually creates troops. It creates healthy bacteria troops that fight off aggressively fight off incoming troops. Wow. That's, so if you come in contact with like funky colds or weird showing your hands, the acidophilus and um, and probiotics, various probiotics will actually go after that stuff and keep it from taking hold.

Speaker 5:          01:59:46       Whereas if you have an unhealthy skin flora and you know, ironically what gives you an unhealthy skin flora using antibacterial soap? No Shit. Yep. Using antibacterial soap is bad for you. I didn't cause, yeah, you most stuff you can cure with just soap and water. Unless you're a surgeon and you're about to cut someone's heart open and you're worried about Murcia [inaudible] what you really want is good soap, just soap and there's in fact soap that actually fosters healthy skin flora. There's some stuff called defense soap that a a lot of grapplers use and if you go to defense soap.com they sell this healthy soap. It has tea tree oil and eucalyptus and all these natural remedies for healthy skin flora promotes healthy skin flora and cleans off all the negative shit. You shouldn't be fucking with a antibacterial soap unless you have a real, you know, doctor prescribed.

Speaker 4:          02:00:36       That's crazy, man. I didn't know that because when I go to the airport I'll buy one of those little tubes and slather my hands. That's okay.

Speaker 5:          02:00:42       That's okay. That's not that bad, but putting it on your hands, it's not that bad. When you wash your body with it, that's when shit gets weird. When, when you it, you can wash your hands then a bacterial soap and you'll be fine. But regular old soap and water will kill anything that's bad. You should wash your hands, wash your hands on a regular basis, especially when you are touching a lot of things in public places. And then you touch your eyes, your face. I mean that's how things get spread you. But washing your hands just with soap and water can fix most of that. But when you wash your body with antibacterial soap, you really fuck up the whole like ecosystem on the surface of your skin. I knew a dude who had, um, he had like chronic ringworm. He started getting ringworm from grappling and started getting it everywhere and you know, uh, I think it was Eddie Bravo school him on it who said like, okay, what are you doing?

Speaker 5:          02:01:27       Like how are you getting this all the time? Like, what are you taking? Do you use Lamisil? Am like, oh, something that kills it. Do you take probiotics? Like you got to not use antibacterial soap. You've got to figure out how to like bring your body back to health because this is like a symptom of an issue. These, what ringworm is, is a, an invading army and it's got a stronghold in your system and as a strong in your system because your system's week. So let's figure out why your systems a week. Like what is it? And that's the holistic approach. They're very few people take, they just go, I'll go to put your man and bacterial soap on his back to prom. Right. It's not just that there's, you're, you're a whole system, you know, it's, but it's really hard for us to wrap our hands because I'm not a system of me.

Speaker 5:          02:02:11       You're Duncan Trussell. That's, you know, that's Brian. Like we're people, right? I'm a person. I know who I am and you're not. No, you're, you're, you're, you're, there's like a consciousness that's moving the school of cells, you know, and the school of cells is of, there's a lot of shit going on. That's fucking crazy, man. That's a crazy thing to think about that we're just like a tightly woven school of bacterial fish swimming through the coral reef of matters. Do you one better the each individual cells almost entirely space. So we don't even know what the fuck we are. We're just, we're, we're this combination of different cells that share some sort of a strange relationship with each other, you know, and each cell is mostly just nothing. Yeah, it's a harmony. And by the way, it's a harmony that is destined to fly apart into a million pieces eventually.

Speaker 5:          02:02:58       That's the other, definitely. Maybe, maybe the figure out a way around that Daca Trussell maybe that's an what were talking about when we did the, the robot apocalypse show where we deal with Robo sapiens. All these, when we went to Dunkin and I and Ra went to this global future 2045 conference in New York City and met with all these futurists. Are we going to get in trouble saying all this stuff? I know we're supposed to keep our lit or, well, we're not, we're not giving away any, um, any secrets. We're just talking about how bad ass it was. That was bad conversations we've got to have with these people. Yeah, it was amazing. We're, we're, we're, we're in strange times. People strange fucking times and getting stranger every God damn day. Yeah. It's true. Every day it's getting weirder and weirder. Beautiful and weird and, and I wish, it's just an interesting thing, man. I'll tell you, if you keep doing this show, man, you're going to stumble upon something fucked up. I don't think so. I think so. That's you, man. You always go to that

Speaker 12:         02:03:53       dead babies, Nancy grace, you're going to stumble on some demonic possession thing. You're going to be in the woods. You're going to find some people. They're going to be sacrificing virgin. You're going to have to make a decision, man, and it's going to be like a star trek thing or star craft thing. You're going to have to move your dongle's into a certain parents. Dongles out, dare you. There's no dongles and star starcraft.

Speaker 5:          02:04:13       Yeah. The angrier he got. Yeah. Oh, it was real. It was real folks. It was real. It was beautiful. But it was real. Duncan Trussell is back on economy horse and he will be appearing tonight at the Ice House was lovely comedy or something. Know what this is going to be like Thompson Guerra. Why do you say that? How dare you? Don't be negative. You creating your own reality. This is the secret. Okay. Yeah. I haven't been on stage in two months. He used to see

Speaker 4:          02:04:37       every comic. I knew I been on stage. It's going to be great. It's going to be the Greek side of my window

Speaker 1:          02:04:43       that hasn't been on stage in what says what it says. What if you haven't been on stage and two months that sock.

Speaker 4:          02:04:50       Can you get a spanking from the gods of comedy?

Speaker 13:         02:04:56       Come on. We all know this.

Speaker 1:          02:04:57       I took three months off once. Wow. Yeah, yeah. Long time ago I got just, I was burnt out and I just decided, you know what? I'm in the middle of so much shit. Let me just take some Tylenol and it was the longest I'd ever taken off a comedy and then I remember getting back on stage. It was like, Oh, this is nice. Like immediately fell right back into it. I miss it. First setback was weird. Second setback was comfortable.

Speaker 4:          02:05:21       Yeah Man, I'm, I'm, I'm excited about it but I know I've got, I've got to pay the piper a little bit and I'm willing to pay the right.

Speaker 1:          02:05:27       You're still performing. See that's one of the things that I've found about doing podcasts and uh, doing them on a regular basis. Especially like you get used to talking in front of people, you get, you get you the, the like the anxiety that fucks up your set, that that's alleviated. You're always going on these rants. I mean you're doing these rants when we do the podcast for the show in front of like just the suits and the camera people and the, the, the folks that work on the show and you're going right into it, go right in the flow. You're not being self conscious. You know, you're, you're completely in the moment. And I think a lot of that has to do with doing a lot of podcasts.

Speaker 4:          02:06:04       Yes, for sure. It's just, yes. It's definitely a skill that you develop and you get, you get, you get better at your right man. It is a form of performance and it's, uh, yeah, I love it. It's really fun. It's a lot less anxiety provoking then getting onstage, but I'm excited about getting on stage again. I want to get back into walking around the ice house, you know, just like being in a comedy club, this thing starts arising in me like, fuck, I miss this man that it, but it, it, it becomes such a huge part of your life, you know? But it's like sometimes you do have to take a break. I had to take a break. I, there's just, I couldn't go on stage after my mom died. I was just too weird. It was like, I just, I didn't, I didn't, just didn't want to spend any mental energy dealing with that.

Speaker 1:          02:06:45       I think I told you about the, the time I went on stage after Phil Hartman and died, well, I had one of the worst sets in my life, like you have to, Phil Hartman died where I fucked up and I, I, I, I was just starting getting my stage legs back under me and then I was at a gas station. I ran into a friend who's a police officer and uh, he gave me some details about the case that I didn't know. Yeah. And it was, I'll spare everyone the more but details. But it was enough to really freak me the fuck out. And then I went on stage and just, I couldn't be funny. It was impossible and I had nothing funny to say. I just ate shit. And I knew in the middle of it that I was never going to pull myself out of it. I knew I shouldn't have been up there. I should have taken more time off, you know, whatever I, whatever amount of time, I don't remember how many weeks it was. I took her off. It just wasn't enough.

Speaker 4:          02:07:27       Sometimes I think you got to do that. And I think in comedy sometimes a, a more of a uh, uh, athletic mentality applied to it, which is like you just got to punk, keep constantly punching the bag no matter what. No matter what, just punched the bag no matter what, just just go through it. And I think if you're going to be doing stand up for your whole life, Shit's gonna happen. That's gonna make you have to take some breaks from time to time.

Speaker 1:          02:07:50       Well, even in that as an athletic point of view is a bad point of view because one of the, one of the key things to athletes is don't get yourself in a Rut and keep going. Recognize what you're doing, step back, assess, reanalyze, go back into it. And also if you get injured, don't keep going. Blow rest up. Okay. Give yourself some recuperation. And I think that a, a life injury, like you know, losing a loved one that's a life injury and you've got to recuperate from that injury and you have to deal with the emotional damage the same way you deal with the damage. To a ligament or damage to a muscle.

Speaker 4:          02:08:24       Yeah, and it and it all and then you can it grief. Grief has its own pattern. It's really curious because you can see that there's like a, a cyclical thing where in like it's, it's terrible in cycles, but then the that gets better and better and better and it's really interesting, man. It's a very natural thing, but I don't know how p I, and I've heard of comics who after their folks die, like you keep doing standup. I just don't know how you do that. It's like you got to sit on the bench for a while and then you buy, I just bought a bird feeder. I bought bird feeders and just sat on my porch and you know, like I was like feeding or right after it happened, I was sitting on my porch and I bird feeders and the birds, it started showing up. I'm like, ah, this is great man. This is really nice and peaceful and birds are showing up to the bird feeder and then there's this lack in a fucking bird flew into the window right in front of me.

Speaker 3:          02:09:17       I'm like, I can't escape death. Kill the fucking bird. Stop getting so comfortable, bitch.

Speaker 1:          02:09:27       And on that note, I love you buddy. I love you too. Hey, thanks for putting me on your show, Joe. So cool. It's so cool having you.
