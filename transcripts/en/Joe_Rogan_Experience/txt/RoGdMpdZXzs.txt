Speaker 1:          00:02          Bitches.

Speaker 2:          00:03          Well we've tried, we've tried other online interventions too, so I have my these youtube videos up, but we also designed. I work with some corporations awhile while back because I've done some consulting and I had designed tests to help people hire better employees, which I still do and in fact I work with this company up in California called the founder institute and it's the world's largest stage early technology company incubator. It's created 2,500 companies in the last four years and we test now in 135 cities, but when I was marketing these tests to companies, they kept asking me what could be done about their poorer performing employees and I said, well, I didn't know because it's not that easy to. If you have someone who's problematic, who's troubled, it's not that easy for a manager to figure out how to straighten them out and they just don't have the time.

Speaker 2:          00:53          They don't have the time. They don't have the manpower and they don't have the training usually to do that. But I designed to set of programs called the self authoring suite and one of them. The future authoring program helps people write out a plan for their life, so it helps them to ask you some questions about six dimensions of your life. You know your, your health, mental and physical, your use of drugs and alcohol, your wishes three to five years down the road for intimate relationships, for family, for career, for education, and so on. It asks you, what could your life be like three to five years down the road? If you set it up for you like you were someone you were taking care of, so it asks you those six questions that it asks you to write for 15 minutes about about your vision for your life.

Speaker 2:          01:36          You get to have what you want and what would be good for you. What would that be? And then it asks you to write for 15 minutes about what your life would be like three to five years down the road. If you let your bad habits and your idiocies in your foolishness is in your weaknesses, take the upper hand in, Auger you into the ground because everyone knows about that. And so it's like you get to design the little heaven to strive for and little hell to avoid. And then you write for. Then you basically turned that into an implementable plan. That's the second part of the program. We've used that with about 5,005 to 7,000 university students now mostly in Europe at the Rotterdam School of management. And we've raised their grade point average of their kids. Twenty five percent drop their dropout rate the same and it's had a walloping effect on men and on non Western ethnic minorities, it's moved the nonwestern ethnic minority student population performance at Rotterdam, School of Management from 70 percent below the, the average to above the female Dutch, uh, natives.

Speaker 2:          02:38          And so the other reason I'm telling you this, apart from the fact that it's a very good program. And um, we, we did it at Mohawk college in Canada a year ago and we dropped their dropout rate in the first semester, 50 percent, and that especially again worked well for men because men are at more risk of dropping out now and, and especially for men who didn't have good grades in high school. So not only is there the possibility for the net to provide tremendous dissemination of intellectual material, but there's also the possibility for the net to provide dissemination of psychological interventions that have major impacts on people's mental health and productivity at almost at extraordinarily low cost. So that's really been fun too. So why think providing some that sort of a structure and a framework, giving people the tools just inform of asking them questions.

Speaker 2:          03:29          What would you like to do is describe this, what is your view? And when you do that, you sort of allow them to help themselves outline what they would like to accomplish, which most people don't do. Well, in our education system, our education system was designed in Chicago in the late 18 hundreds to produce factory workers because it was set up when when rural people were migrating to the cities on mass because their kids, first of all, we're likely to get factory jobs and second of all, if you were working in factory, your kids needed to be taken care of and so the purpose of the schools was to train factory workers, which is why everyone's lined up in rows, rows and why there are bells. It's a factory model. The problem with that is that now people's careers basically have to be self determined, but that's never.

Speaker 2:          04:14          That's never part of the education system. Part of the reason I developed these programs was because I realized this is the same course where I'm teaching students that if they would have been in Germany in the 19 thirties, they would have been Nazis. I'm trying to get them to design their lives and it's way better to have someone articulate their own plan. You actually neurologically rewire people by having them formulate their own thoughts, which is why you know, your school teachers used to say, put it in your own words. It's actually very good advice. If they would explain what that means. It's like if you have to conjure up the thoughts and you have to articulate them, then they change you. And so. Well, and so this program has had the, the, the, the effects have been absolutely overwhelming for us as researchers because it's very, very difficult to produce an intervention that actually has a positive effect on people, you know, you hope it does, but generally when you test it out, it's like, no, it doesn't do what you thought it did.

Speaker 2:          05:13          Or sometimes it even has the reverse effect. That sounds fascinating. Now, how do people have, how can someone, a regular person have access to this? It's called self authoring. So that's s e l, f authoring, like, like writing a book, self authoring Dotcom and the programs I gave away the future authoring program, I think it might still be free. Um, it was, yeah, it is until the end of November. I did a video called message to millennials were because one of the things Jonathan Heit said about, uh, he called Karl Marx, the patron saint of the social justice warriors and John Stuart Mill, that patron saint of people say who stood for objective truth and freedom of expression. And I thought that was really smart. He said Brown university is number one for social justice universities in Chicago for truth universities. But one of the things that marks has over John Stuart mill is that mark's is a social revolutionary and young people like to think about ways to change the world.

Speaker 2:          06:10          Right? And that's actually a positive part of their development. It's a stage that the developmental psychologist, Sean Piaget called the messianic stage and he associated that with late adolescence. So like, while young people want to change the world, the problem is, is that that's been harnessed into attempts to change other people, but that isn't what you should do if you want to change the world, you should change yourself. And I don't mean that in some cliched sense. I mean it in the sense that Alexander Solzhenitsyn said when he analyzed the Soviet Union, he said, don't be thinking that the line that divides good from evil runs down political spectrum or, or, or countries or something like that. It runs down right down the middle of your soul and if you want to sort out the world and what you do is you sort yourself out. It's a serious business, right?

Speaker 2:          06:55          They say it's more difficult to rule yourself than to rule a city and that's the truth because you're a complicated and there are horrible monsters inside of you that needed to be tamed and to, and to be brought in, to be brought into alignment and submission so that you can be a powerful and useful person. And I gave away the future authoring program as part of this video. I made suggesting to millennials that instead of rushing out there to change the world by changing other bad people, that they should look inward and sort themselves out properly. And, um, I think we've given away about four or 5,000 of those programs so far. It's about free till the end of November and then what happens with it? Well, the self or the future authoring program is regularly $14 and ninety five cents and the whole self authoring suite which involves.

Speaker 2:          07:41          It's a program that helps you write an autobiography so it helps you sort out things about your past that are still burdening you. You can tell a if, if you have a memory that's more than 18 months old approximately, and when you pull that memory up to mind, if you still have an emotional reaction, that means you haven't fully articulated the memory, you haven't analyzed it causally, you haven't. You haven't freed yourself from its grasp and you're carrying it like a weight and your brain responds to that like the more have more weight you're carrying like that more baggage. Let's say the more of the stress Hormone Cortisol your brain produces and cortisol makes you old. Some of the work has been done by James Pennebaker at the University of Texas at Austin because he. He started to pioneer these sorts of writing programs and he found that if people wrote about uncertain things, past, present or future so they could be traumatic things, they could be uncertain, things that their physical health improved and he.

Speaker 2:          08:39          He did a lot of detailed research trying to figure out why that was and basically came down to the explanation that it was something like an uncertainty reduction mechanism at work. Because your brain is always figuring out how well situated are you in the world. How much do you not know to how much have you mastered? And you can tell that you've mastered things. Because when you go somewhere and you act things turn out the way you want them. That's an indication of mastery and your brain is sort of keeping track across your whole life of how many places you've been, where things haven't worked out compared to how many places you have been, where they have worked out. And if all those places in your past where things haven't worked out, you need to map and master and that. That decreases the existential load on you.

Speaker 2:          09:25          But that actually decreases your psychophysiological load, it makes you healthier, it makes you less stress, and so we've put all that together in this self authoring suite to help people write about their past, to sort it out in a, in a detailed autobiography, it asks you questions about your past, it says, divide your life up into six epochs and then divide each of those that might be, say, oh, birth to kindergarten and then maybe elementary school and then maybe junior high school however you want to do it. And then to write about the emotionally significant events in each of those epochs and then to describe their effects on you and then to analyze how you did in those situations, what you might have done differently, what you might do differently in the future to straighten out your past. And I've done that with my students in my maps of meaning class for about the last 10 years.

Speaker 2:          10:11          And some people have written 15,000 words. It's not that uncommon for students to write 15,000 words and their autobiography. Wow. So that's such great advice. That's such great advice about reconciling with your past. Because so many people just carry it around. Yeah, well, if you're. If you're thinking about your past, what it means is you haven't analyzed the causal chains because you might say, well, why do you remember your past? While you might say, well, it's in order to have an objective record of the past. It's like it has nothing to do with that. There's only one reason you remember the past and that's to be prepared for the future. That's why you remember the past, and so what you're supposed to do is take the past and extract out from it. Wisdom and wisdom is the ability to avoid stumbling blindly into ditches, and so you think, well, here's a time in my past, I stumbled blindly into this horrible ditch and terrible things happened to me.

Speaker 2:          11:04          It's like, okay, you need to take that apart. You need to figure out how was it that that events conspired with your participation voluntarily or involuntarily so that that terrible consequences emerged. You need to know why that happened and how you could react differently in that situation. And as soon as you do that, your brain will leave it alone. You won't obsess you about it anymore because the anxiety producing parts of your brain are basically trying to tell you where there are obstacles in your environment. It's like, look out. Don't go there. Don't go there. It's like, well, don't go there. There's fire. Well, maybe you could master the fire, right? Then you're a wielder of fire. You're not just a victim, and lots of situations are dangerous or not dangerous, depending on your level of mastery, right? Life is like that. And so a negative emotion that's associated with a memory is something that's crying out for mastery and writing can really help with that.

Speaker 2:          12:04          So you're reorganizing your brain. When you write autobiographically, you're, you're basically the emotions. Imagine emotion memories can be stored at different levels of your brain, some sort of primordial reptilian image laden areas that are very emotional opt to finally articulated plans for your future life. Will you want to take everything that's negative and emotional and transform that into a fully articulated vision for your future. And that frees you of your past. You shouldn't be thinking about your past. I mean maybe if you're 80 and you know you're going over a well spent life, that's a whole different thing, but if you're 30, 35 or 20, and most of the time you're thinking about your past, it's like it's like your soul is trapped back there and you need to. You need to free it through investigation and the metaphysical language is appropriate because that is in a sense what you're doing. You're trapped in the past. It's like you've got to break free of that so you can use all your resources to move ahead into the future.
