Speaker 1:          00:00          The joe rogan experience, you gave it an eight. I think garage bands pretty amazing too. The, the program where you can pretty much make your own song pretty easily. Don't they have programs like that for your phone now? Oh yeah. Yeah, absolutely. Absolutely. There was, I don't know if we ever talked about it. There was this, back in the day in my space, somebody linked, uh, one of my songs on their myspace page and like stole it from my web host. And so like when you went to their myspace page, it automatically played a song for myself. So I, what I did is I took that file, took it down, and then made up a quick song and garage band about like, ah, Stacy from Hollywood, California. I want you to suck my Dick and made a whole song just about how I wanted to fuck this girl and stuff like that.

Speaker 1:          00:44          And I replaced that song, that file, what the original file so that when people went to her myspace page, it just started playing that song. Yeah. I just love it. I don't know how that, why even thought about that, but it's pretty funny video. It's funny when you think that with a hot linking and speaking of my space, I think the yesterday what officially really just downsize. They shut off Germany, my space, Germany is dead. Somebody tweeted me, my space cut all their employees like three months ago. Like half of their employees, they cut Jordan and they just did it again. Jordy. Yeah, Jordy was rich and now you're lucky to, you know he's worth comedy central but they use working memory. We would come. My sweets comedy was thriving. I'm sure you did one of those secret shows. I do want a secret shows.

Speaker 1:          01:27          I'm thinking about deleting my mind space live on the air. What do you think do it if they're going to cut, show and ruin. You know, it's funny how we did it with a, I think, I forget who we did it with, like Jason Tebow or something like that. Somebody deleted their, my space the other day live on air a on the old one podcast. Christ. I can't even come up with one original idea, but watch how many steps it is. It's pretty hilarious. It was Ari. Ari did it and it was like three steps. Like they make it really hard. Like are you sure you still have people on it trying to talk to you? Very, very, very, very few. Almost all of it is completely dead as well. You want to go into my mind that also will duel? Yeah, dual one. I paid some money to have my tricked out too at one point.

Speaker 1:          02:12          Yeah. Did you have glitter tags? I don't know. It seems like you would probably cause a failure. I'm just, I can even say it. So if you want to delete your my space now too, and we could have a double my space and I'm going to keep mine hide this motherfucker. It's not easy. I don't even know where to go. Um, here, I'll tell you guys where to go. Hold on. Um, more. Delete my space. I don't even know if I know my family that it's time to let it go. You know what I mean?
