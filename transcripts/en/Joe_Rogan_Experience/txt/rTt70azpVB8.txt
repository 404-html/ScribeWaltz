Speaker 1:          00:00:02       And we're live. What's that brick happy memorial day. Happy Memorial Day. A perfect day to have you want to talk about your project because this, um, it's called a fighting season. It's available right now on iTunes. And for folks who, uh, are not, uh, aware of Rick Schroeder, first of all, how dare you and a actor, I'm now director, producer, you're doing a lot of different things and we've been friends for what,

Speaker 2:          00:00:34       10 years now? 10 years. Yeah. Long time girls introduced this thankfully.

Speaker 1:          00:00:38       Yeah. So you are documentary series is pretty intense man. And you showed me a bunch of it last time I was over your house and I was the, first of all I was really impressed. But one of the things I was really impressed with was your commitment to doing this. I mean you spent a lot of time in, in Afghanistan and uh, like embedded. You were with the soldiers in firefights. I mean you were there pretty much every step of the way.

Speaker 2:          00:01:05       Yeah. I was there 110 days from March until July, 2014 and I needed to be there because I needed to be there that long because just to build trust with the, the soldiers and the units that I would embed with took sometimes weeks alone just to, because everybody looked at me like, what's this journalists doing here? A lot of the guys were 20, 22, 25 in these platoons. No, had no idea of my past. They thought I was just a journalist and camera guy that was there to tell a story that was probably negative. So just took time to build a relationship with them, um, before I got into their worlds. And, but you know, it's funny the, you know, when, when you do go out and got combat patrol and you do have contact with an enemy, then like all of a sudden you know that you're with, you're one of them.

Speaker 2:          00:01:52       So it like totally changes the dynamic, but it has to be some big event has to happen typically for them to accept you. Wow. That's, that's pretty intense man. So what was the motivation to do this? And like, when did you decide, how long did it take to plan this out? Like, yeah, so the motivation is probably, you know, I was always curious about what war was, you know, war is just one of those things that it has affected mankind and, and, and change the course of history since the beginning of time. Right. The act of war. And so, you know, I was always curious about what war was. And I, in my mind, I always thought, wow, I have to experience what it is or else I don't have like a whole picture of what it means to be, you know, in this state of, you know, this condition has man.

Speaker 2:          00:02:41       So I was always looking for an opportunity where I could sort of experienced it. Um, but you know, I didn't come along for a long, long time, but after nine 11, you know, I've been sitting there watching, you know, US fight in the war on terror for 13 or 14 years. My living room, like there were most of us. And you know, I, I had an opportunity because I knew a three star general named Lieutenant General Anderson at the Fort Bragg, North Carolina who was deploying to Afghanistan in the spring of 2014 so I asked Joe, I said, Joe, can I go with you guys? And he's like, why do you want to go? And I'm like, well Joe, I think it's important to document, you know, what we've accomplished or failed to accomplish in that country for the last 13 years. We've spent a lot of money there, we've lost a lot of people there, we've had a lot of handicapped and amputees come from that war.

Speaker 2:          00:03:32       And I think it's important to show what ending a war looks like, how hard it is, how complicated is, how ugly it is. And so he agreed and he said, okay, I'll make it happen. Now this was when you had already started doing that show for the army. You had done this show. What was the show called? The, the project that I started working for, what's called starting strong, started working for the army for, that's a branded content shell. It's like long form kind of, um, a infomercial in a sense, ultimately for the starting strong for the military. I mean, that's a 30 minute, it's not truly a reality show, right? It's, it's, it's branded content. It's, it's messaging that they want in there that I helped produce and I have a government contract and I produced that for them. So in that sense, one of the conversations that we had about that, they, they're fairly restrictive about what you ere and what you don't air and you didn't have a lot of creative freedom with that.

Speaker 2:          00:04:28       That's right. I mean, they, it's a long form commercial jail starting strong, but it's, it's well done and it's real. There's nothing in it that's not, not truthful, but it's definitely controlled by the army and the messaging that they want to put into it. So it's not necessarily balanced. Like the negative aspects are not really shown. You're just kind of showing the things that they want. Yeah. And ultimately they have the final edit there, the final judge and jury on those decisions when you have, you know, a creative, uh, difference. So that really kind of opened your eyes to this possible or open your mind to this possibility of doing this nonrestrictive embedded reality. I mean this is a real, a real documentary that, yeah, this is the real deal. I mean this is, this is John Paul Dejoria, the guy who owns patroned Tequila in me, uh, each kicking in a chunk of money and you know, putting together a film crew.

Speaker 2:          00:05:20       And I scrambled after I talked to Joe Anderson and Fort Bragg in February, I was in Afghanistan by February, by March and I brought three camera guys with me. I brought, I hired a local there and the only limitation the army put on me was they said we are going to have to review for operational security and any things that could endanger our soldiers or give away capabilities, tactics, techniques and procedures of certain weapon systems or things that we employ to defeat the enemy. Which, which is pretty interesting stuff. And I can talk about a little bit with you, some of those tools we have. Like what were the things that you were not allowed to put in? So like when we were on the, let's say I'm a drone, we were, when we were trying to do dynamic or, or um, kinetic strikes with drones on bad guys, we were following, um, known terrorists that had pictures and names and we were following them from the air.

Speaker 2:          00:06:15       Um, and looking for opportunities to shoot hellfire missile and eliminate them. Um, there's certain information that's on the drone feeds the monitor feeds that gives away sort of capabilities of the drone. I see. And so we had to blur that. Um, there was certain weapons systems which are just brand new that you couldn't even talk about and people will know that they're not released to the public. Yeah, that's always tripped me out. Like things like the area 51 stuff and the groom, Lake weather test, all this crazy technology out there and people don't even know about it until it's too late. It's one of the things, not, not too late necessarily, but I mean until it's already employed. One of the things, um, that they attribute to a lot of the UFO sightings. It was like stealth bombers and the B 52 and [inaudible] 51 and all these different technologies they had created out there in the [inaudible] desert and people had no idea they even existed until they started using them.

Speaker 2:          00:07:11       You know, the technology that I saw an experience with the army and the way that they can, you know, fight and conduct war and gather intelligence and stuff was, it was phenomenal. Absolutely phenomenal. Um, at that, that being said, there's only so much you can do to overcome an adversary that's a suicide bomber that's going to, you know, load the car with explosives and drive it into your, you know, check point, um, or walk up to you and detonate. There's only so much you can do with technology. Um, and it's, there's just certain things it's hard to mitigate against and that, that's fanatics. Yeah. And this war in particular and a, the first desert storm war, it was really the first time that they had experienced that as the United States military and experienced that from the enemy, right. Except the Japanese suicide bombers. But the kamikaze is, it was sort of a different story.

Speaker 2:          00:08:03       Yeah. I mean that's the only time I can really remember is the weapon of choice becoming, um, a human, you know, his, his, um, World War II with the kamikazes and then, you know, you started hearing about it in Iraq, um, and that really wasn't employed and Afghanistan for many years early in the war. And then they decided to change tactics and bring, bring that to the battlefield. But you know, the really disgusting thing with, with some of that is, you know, they use kids a lot for suicide bombers. Um, you know, kids that are handicapped, kids that have mental problems, down syndrome or handicaps in some way, they'll actually, you know, radicalize the kids in Pakistan madrassas or schools teach them that, you know, it's, it's, um, it's the highest degree of glory to die in the act of Jihad because without jihad actually you can't actually get the 72 versions. So the kids are actually trained to thank the Americans kind of in a way, or thank the out of the infidels because without the infidels to kill, you can't get the highest degree of,

Speaker 1:          00:09:06       of a celestial glory. That term, 72 virgins. Apparently. I looked it up. What a lot of people think that it's actually like the number 72, but it's like a shit load. It's like saying a shit load, you know, like you how it's more than 72. Well, you know what I mean? It's like, it's a term like, you know, like it's not a, it's not an exact term. I don't know what the a, the definition that would be, but you know, um, you know, people say that, uh, it's a cajillion exaggeration. It was the original, I mean it's not, it's not really defined. It's just a large number of versions that apparently is what they mean by saying 72. Cause I always thought like that's so specific. What does that mean? Yeah. I mean it's a cultural thing obviously, but yeah. Um, so this is really a crazy undertaking.

Speaker 1:          00:09:56       I mean I really, I mean you threw your whole life into this, you separate yourself from your family for many months, a hundred plus days, and then, uh, went over there. And was there any, was there any point in time in the, in the process of this before you launched where you had second thoughts? We did, you know that you were going to commit yourself to such a long extended stay. So I did have second thoughts, um, before I went, you know, especially cause like three days before I left, Andrea and my wife said, don't go. If you love me, don't go, whoa. And so if you love the kids don't go.

Speaker 2:          00:10:33       I got that. And so I had to deal with that like three days before. And that was pretty tough. Um, because I do love my wife and do love my kids, but I went. So, um, but, but yeah, I mean it was definitely a hard, a hard thing to, um, to come to terms with tea, to come to grips with. Um, you know, my camera, one of my camera guys backed out the day of the trip. Um, and I went out there at one time before my team actually and just to scout and look for different embeds in different characters and stuff that I could follow. Different soldiers, different units, different missions. And we follow everything in this just, you know, from three star general who was the commander of the battlefield of in all of Afghanistan to, you know, um, Colonel John Graham, which is a, a great embed where he advises the chief of police and cool, which is 6 million people, cops with RPGs, 13,000 man pill, paramilitary police force in Kabul, heroin industry, thriving black market for weapons thriving and are in bed, was with criminal Graham embedded with the chief of police for cobble, um, you know, trying to secure the city and build the ring of steel.

Speaker 2:          00:11:41       They called it, which was like 50 something checkpoints to try to keep suicide bombers and vehicle borne IED is out of the city before the election because the Taliban had threatened immense bloodshed to disrupt the elections. This was 2014 was just, you know, um, the first peaceful transition of power in Afghanistan, legitimate transfer of power after Karzai. And so the Taliban wanted nothing more than to, to, to disrupt that process. They want Sharia law, they don't want democracy. And so 2014 ended up being the deadliest fighting season in Afghanistan's history, at least while we were there. I don't know about the Soviets, but while we were there and more civilians, more tallyman and more coalition forces were killed in 2014 than any other year. So yeah. So I mean, going into this, I started to get some, you know, jitters here, they're cold feet, but you know, I, I commit and you know, I know how to jump, you know, like hold your, hold your balls and junk kind of attitude.

Speaker 2:          00:12:38       Right. I know how to do that, thankfully. And so that's what you do is you just jump, you know, you just, you just because I couldn't live with myself if I didn't. Right. I mean, you couldn't, I couldn't. And so it was, um, you know, and really what was really stressful though was they started killing journalists in Afghanistan in 2014. It's specifically targeting people that had cameras. And so, you know, every while I was there, you'd get news reports of, you know, two, two dead journalists are dead journalists here are two dead there, you know, purposely shot by our allies, our, our, our own, not our allies, but our, our own Afghan partners that we were partnering with, whether it'd be Afghan national army and a or Afghan Ello, Alp Afghan local police would turn guns on journalists. And it, it turns out, you know, you never quite understand why it happened.

Speaker 2:          00:13:32       A lot of times it's Taliban infiltrate the ranks of the, of the, um, of the security forces in Afghanistan that do that. But, uh, but sometimes it's cultural differences. They don't like cameras pointed at them. They don't like they're there. They don't like you to talk to women. If you talk to women or open a door for a woman, you could insult somebody so much that it's the kind of place where they pull a gun out and they kill you. Wow. Yeah. So the stress, the anxiety just never ends because like on that embed with criminal Graham and the Cabo police, you know, we were a six or seven person team embedded with a 13,000 men, Afghan police force. And so all day long we're surrounding by Afghans with AK is and RPGs. And so every building you go into, you're surrounded by Africans with guns and there's just six or seven years, sometimes two or three of you.

Speaker 2:          00:14:24       And so you're always trying to put your back to the wall. And the anxiety of that is just relentless. Even though Maine, nothing may happen, but just the potential that something's going to happen is kind of exhausting. Yeah. I can only imagine, especially knowing that some of these security forces were killing journalists. Did they give you a list of things? Never do. No. Um, that's how to learn along the way. Yeah. I mean you ask for advice. I mean, I think that's one of the weirdest things about like going to going go into a place like that is there is no rule book. All you can look is for people that have experienced, that have done it before, been there before, and ask and hope somebody takes you under their wing and you know, decides to give you a little bit of comfort, you know, and, and decides to try to teach you something along the way.

Speaker 1:          00:15:12       God, that's gotta be insanely stressful. So I could just call him, imagine being a small number of people also surrounded by all these Afghan security forces and then also having the knowledge that some of these people that Taliban had embedded in some of these people and they didn't filtrate it and they were in the ranks and they were, they were upset that the Americans were there in the first place and they were resentful of the whole situation and, you know, very angry.

Speaker 2:          00:15:43       Yeah. Um, it was, you know, it was mine exhausting my numbing. It was almost like you, you don't know where the enemy is. And it's like, once you know where the enemy is, then at least you can focus on him and you can face him. But the enemy can be anywhere in that kind of environment. And so like it'd be, you know, on a patrol or walking through a village and there's a bunch of guys around and they all got shovels and you know, but you know, some of them are Taliban, you know that for sure. Some of them are talent man, but they're holding a shovel and you can't prove it. So you have to really wait until, you know, they decided they want to fight that day because typically it's up to them. You know, where they fight, when they fight, they're the ones that determine those things.

Speaker 1:          00:16:27       That's gotta be really crazy. So it's very difficult to figure out who exactly the enemy is. You looking at one guy, he might be a farmer and the guy next to him might be Taliban

Speaker 2:          00:16:38       or the guy might be a farmer one day and then he needs money the next, so he picks up as a k or plants an IED the next day because he needs money and he becomes Taliban. Wow. Did you learn the language? No, I'm a few words here or there. What do they speak on? Dari is the people in the north and Pash tune is the people in the south and it's really a tribal conflict that country as opposed to sharia versus Sunni. So what is the conflict? It's, it's very different people. It's the people in the north that are dory there, the Northern Alliance, they're Asian kind of mixed. Um, the, you know, used to have those big Buddhist statues up there and their lands that got blown up by the Taliban than Islam came into that country and sort of kick Buddhism out. And so it sort of all when Islam, um, and then the people in the south or the past tunes, you know, very, very connected to Iran, you know, kind of culturally. Um, and so there's a conflict between those groups. And then there's also conflicts with the states around there. Like India, Afghanistan really likes the Indian people and Indian way of life

Speaker 3:          00:17:50       and the sports, the music, Bollywood, cricket, you know, the Indian businessmen all over Kabul, um, and Pakistan, you know, sort of as at odds with India. And the last thing they want is Afghanistan to be a ally of India to Pakistan doesn't kind of want surrounded by, you know, people they find unfriendly. So there's, the conflict is, you know, diverse. It's, it's, it's heroin, it's poppy, opium. Um, a lot of money comes out of that. And who controls that money and where does the money go? Yeah. And the also the soldiers have to actually help some of these guys that are growing poppies because they get information and because it keeps the, keeps certain allies in place. Like they had this thing on Fox News where Geraldo Rivera was over there and he was trying to, uh, help explain why the soldiers were guarding poppy fields to people at home.

Speaker 3:          00:18:51       That was like, what in the fuck is going on over there? Well, here's the good news. The good news is 90 something percent of that heroin, that opium goes to Iran and Russia. It doesn't come to us. Ours comes out of Mexico. It's not good news for Iran and Russia now, but as a weapon, it's good news. Um, it meaning that the Taliban used heroin is a weapon against us. Like at first when they were in power, they outlawed the growing of it. So it went to zero when they were taken out of power. Um, poppy production exploded and huge, huge growth. And so everybody grows it. It's just such a cash crop. And um, and so, but then they tax it, tell him that makes $200 million a year from, from some of the analysts had talked to, from taxing the growing of it and the movement of it back to Pakistan.

Speaker 3:          00:19:39       Wow. Wow. That's, uh, that's pretty insane. So that, is that one of the primary means of, of generating income for them? Well yet, because in Afghanistan there's basically no roads so they need to grow crops that ha that don't spoil. So when they grow, when they grow up heroin, when they grow that opium, then they can store it in bricks and it doesn't spoil and then they can treat it like gold or silver. And so it's not like, you know, another kind of food or other item that spoils. It's cause they don't have infrastructure to move stuff to market either. So it's partly, those are the reasons partly to that it's such a big crop. The must have been an exam, insane experience and insane culture shock for you going from, I mean you were a child star and now you're a grown man producing documentaries and then you're in this insanely odd world. You traveling around Kabul, which is essentially the only city in Afghanistan, right? I mean most of Afghanistan is and

Speaker 1:          00:20:48       run by tribal bore lords, different SEC segments. What did, what is cobble like? Like, what does it like to travel around that city?

Speaker 2:          00:20:57       It's a very small downtown center that looks fairly modern, that has fairly modern looking buildings that even may have at traffic lights and sewer. But once you get out of that sort of nucleus that may be two or three square miles of infrastructure. It just, because it basically becomes a city of 6 million mud huts and 6 million people, but all living in mud and dirt roads. Um, just a massive, massive village really. And then there's Kandahar in the south. So those are the two, which is just another massive, that has no city center. That's a massive village, Kandahar, um, mud village. And then, and then all these valleys around where there's no roads connecting them. So people live and die in the same valleys without going anywhere

Speaker 1:          00:21:46       in, they have to get all their food from that valley. Yeah. And what's their primary source of food there?

Speaker 2:          00:21:51       They grow it. They grow it. They, they got some of the best berries I've ever tasted. I remember we were having, um, um, needing with some Afghan army guys, um, planning operation and they brought out bowls of like berries and they're like boys and berries and blackberries and raspberries. And there were the sweetest, finest berries I've ever tasted. They would just taste like sugar. They were so sweet. Nothings sour about them. And so it's a very, like, it's very arid place, but where they have water, it's very productive land. They grow amazing fruit orchards, nuts, um, and they have a lot of lambs and sheep. You typically what they eat for meat.

Speaker 1:          00:22:32       And so I would think that in that sort of an environment, it's very difficult for progress to take place. That what progress did we think of like infrastructure, sewage systems, electrical power, running water, all that different stuff. It seems like it's very difficult to, to change. I mean, what, one of the things that I remember from the election was when there was a debate between John Mccain and Obama and Obama was talking about Afghanistan, about bringing troops in Afghanistan. And he was doing it in a way that John McCain thought was very ignorant of the environment. And he said, you know, I don't think, you know, I'm paraphrasing, but he was saying essentially, I don't think you know what it's like over there. Like that place hasn't changed since Alexander the great came through. And when you describe it that way, I think he kind of puts it in perspective for people like these people. It's not going to change. Like it's one of the reasons why the Soviets could never win the war there. It's one of the reasons why it's so incredibly difficult for anybody to make any,

Speaker 2:          00:23:33       well the hope is the Internet. The hope is the internet because like literally several dozen TV stations have sprung up. Several hundred radio stations have sprung up in the last years on the Internet and cell cell signals and cell phones. You know, now there is a group of young people that, and that I've tasted the, the world through the Internet and they see a different world and they see the opportunity, they see that, you know, and, and those are, those are the majority of the 8 million people that came to vote on election day. Um, you know, and, and women and young people. And so the big thing is to try to give that core group of people in that country, the time and the space to grow, to develop and to get, you know, roots of democracy and roots of, of, um, you know, civil order established, uh, to try to deal with the corruption, the huge amount of corruption in the Afghan government.

Speaker 2:          00:24:30       I mean, this is, this is a place where fuel trucks will be coming from Pakistan to say, fill the downtown. The police department's fueled reservoirs in Kabul and on the way, um, so much fuel will be stolen along the way from Pakistan that, but by the time it gets to the edges of Kabul, you know, all eight trucks will be RPG and burned because nobody wants evidence that the trucks were empty. And so that's the kind of level of corruption that that is going on that you know that you have to try to at the ministerial level, the ministers like that's where we've got to make sure we fixed. I'm, the other problem with that country is like, it's, it's, it's sustaining itself. So like you'll go to a outpost and you'll see vehicles that look fairly well, like they can be reused for patrols and they're just sitting there and they'd been sitting there a long time and the commander of the army golf say, what's up with the vehicles?

Speaker 2:          00:25:29       The guys were like, we can only do foot patrols. Well, what's up with the vehicles? Why don't you do vehicle patrols? What? We don't have a fan belt and we can't get a fan belt until we bring the vehicle back to the brigade headquarters 150 miles away to actually get the fan belt put on because they won't push the parts out because of the threat of them being stolen on the way they, they want all the equipment to go back to the brigade headquarters, which you can't get the vehicle. There is no tow truck. So there's those kinds of problems where they have to figure out how to logistically resupply their, their self and sustain themselves. They have to be trained on all that. Wow. That is bananas. What a crazy place. Crazy place. Crazy place. Is there a sense of helplessness about that? When, when you're there, like when you look at this, you liked, how is anybody gonna fix this?

Speaker 2:          00:26:25       First of all, Jamie, can you turn the AC on in here? It was hot. It's fucking hat. Is there a sense of helplessness at all? Um, yeah. You, you, I mean it depends on who you talk to. You talked to the officers in the army and some of the other folks, um, you know, that see the big picture sometimes and they're, um, they believe it's, it can, it can be one, they believe that the Afghans can win it. The Afghans can, can resist the Taliban and then you talk to the enlisted guys and typically every one of them says it's going to take generations and generations to change this. And if it changes, I wouldn't want, I mean, how would you possibly get the internet to these people and these mud huts? I mean it seems like if the Internet is the hope, how do you get the Internet to people that don't have running water?

Speaker 2:          00:27:12       I mean it seems like that would be their number one priority first and, well, I mean they're doing a lot of good there. I mean life. Um, you know, like I was reading some statistics since we got there. Like, you know, the amount of literacy has gone through the roof, you know, life expectancy, infant mortality has gone down, life expectancy has gone up. So many good things have happened in 13 years in that place. We built some roads now and some infrastructure that go all the way around the entire country of Afghanistan is a giant circle. And, and so we've done a lot of good things. Um, but basically the international community, because it wasn't just us, this was a NATO mission. The first time I was told that NATO was ever invoked. NATO wasn't with, started to, uh, you know, work in Europe to defend everybody, uh, against the, uh, access, I guess m and we invoke NATO's support after September 11th and NATO came to our aid.

Speaker 2:          00:28:09       And so that, what was interesting was, you know, there was military members from like 50 or 60 nations in Afghanistan when I was there. A lot of them weren't going out and doing patrols like the Germans were. And some other countries were actually out there engaged. But most of them were sort of, you know, doing stuff that was, um, nation building kind of events as opposed to direct combat. But, um, you know, so that's the hope is that the international community doesn't abandoned this country because if they don't have the money to pay their army and pay their soldiers, it falls apart. So now the United States has pulling out the majority of troops from Afghanistan. And what happens then? What is, what is the, what's the number one concern from the people that have been there that are on the ground? Like what's the number one concern?

Speaker 2:          00:29:03       I think America leaving completely their there. You know, the, the President Asha Afghani and the Prime Minister of Doula Doula came to Washington, I think recently just talked to the president and basically both thanked him and thanked America for all the sacrifice that it's made to help their country. But, but basically basically pleaded with him, don't leave, we need you to stay. We are too fragile. We are too young. And I think that's the biggest fear of, of the people there is that we will completely abandoned them and Taliban will come back into power. Now there's a, there's a growing segment of, um,

Speaker 1:          00:29:42       in this country and all around the world. I guess that I don't like American, uh, interventionalism if that's a word. They don't like the fact that we're nation building. They don't like the fact that we'd go over there and tried to clean up this mess that's existed. I mean, or you know, whatever he called a mass, call it a cultural divide, what, whatever you want to call it. Impose our standards of living and our ideas in this place.

Speaker 2:          00:30:09       Um, but these, the people that live there, they want this, they want to run it. Yeah. I mean the locals are so glad. I mean life under the Taliban was, was brutal and horrible, but back to your point of nation building and stuff, you know, either got to commit and do it or you got to just go do what you gotta do and leave. So like, you know, when we went into Afghanistan, right. And it was to kill al Qaeda and Sama Bin Ladin and we sort of didn't ever want to mess with the Taliban. Really. Taliban didn't have international goals. I don't think they were just wanted their piece of the world. It was al Qaeda. That was, you know, hurt us, attacked us, and Taliban wouldn't give all, I'll kind of over. So we went there and tried to, tried to get kill every, all kind of member we could took awhile still happening.

Speaker 2:          00:30:57       Um, but the, the, you know, we got drug into this Taliban conflict. We've got drug into it and 14 years later we're still there. Um, so, you know, I think there's going to be a debate, national debate one day on nation building and using, you know, the military to, to build nations. Um, because I always thought the military was designed to destroy an enemy and, and then leave. But now maybe that's changing and politicians, you want them to destroy the enemy or kind of destroy the enemy, but then help build up a nation. If that's what you want them to do, then at least build them like that, right? Build them, um, to succeed in that environment. Um, but I think the fighting season, the importance of this is we're going to show, you know, how we left Afghanistan with the fighting season Docu series and whatever happens in Afghanistan down the road, if it, if it crashes and Burns or success story, you know, we'll, we'll, we'll be able to reference the fighting season from the soldiers perspectives of how we left it in 2014.

Speaker 1:          00:32:07       There's a lot of people that are very cynical about nation building because there's a lot of money involved and that money involved. I mean, especially when Dick Cheney was the vice president, of course, he was the former CEO of Halliburton. Halliburton got those gigantic multibillion dollar, no bid contracts to go over there and rebuild areas that we had destroyed. And a lot of people recognize that there was a whole industry behind that. Now, not just the military industrial complex, but this rebuilding industry, the contracting. It was, it became

Speaker 2:          00:32:40       an enormous sense, an enormous source rather of, of money. Yeah. I can't really speak to that too much. Um, what I can say is that, you know, I saw some, some places that the Afghans had built some Afghan bases that they had actually constructed on their own. We paid for them to build it. And you know, some of the guys that control the money were telling me, you know, this would have taken us two years and this much, lots of money to build these guys, built it in, you know, nine months and for way less. Yeah, maybe the craftsmanship is not as good. You know, it's one of like Mexico kind of block housing as opposed to what we might have built. But it was, it was enough. It was official. It's efficient. And so, you know, these guys I was with with the army, we're very proud of the fact that they were able to get money cut loose from that contracting process and get it to the Afghans to help their local economy, to help them build stuff, you know, get employed their people.

Speaker 2:          00:33:37       And so, you know, Joe, I'm sure you know, you know, I don't discount what you say at all. I'm sure that there's, when there's money involved, people do crazy things. Um, but you know, I just know the guys that I was with, they ain't getting paid a lot of money. The soldiers in getting paid a lot of money there, they're walking towards the gunfire, happy to do it for next to nothing and not next to nothing that's disrespectful and they have a sufficient income. But, but it's still not to risk your life. I don't know. They don't do it for money, honestly. They don't do it for month money. The first day you get up in the morning in Afghanistan was a feeling like, like you're in Mars. It's just like you're in a new unit, a new world, you know, you don't know anybody.

Speaker 2:          00:34:27       There's no friendly faces, you know? Nope. Everybody's looking at you like, what are you doing here? Even the soldiers you're with are leery of you. So it's like you're just on your own. You know? It's like you taking care of yourself, self, self reliance in that place. Nobody's going to carry your water. Nobody's going to pack your stuff. Nobody's gonna make sure you make it somewhere on time or don't, you know, you're just self reliant. And so it's, it's just feels like, okay, um, um, I'm on my own and it's kind of a, you know, and then eventually you know that that wears away. You start meeting people and you start seeing friendly faces and there's certain Afghans that you start to, to really, like, especially the interpreters, these young men that are in their early twenties that are risking everything to work with the US army on the hopes that they're going to get on the promise that they're going to get a green card from the State Department.

Speaker 2:          00:35:20       And there's many of them that aren't getting them for, for whatever reasons, I don't know. But these young interpreters that are risking it all, I mean, I remember them saying, please don't put my face on the picture because if the Taliban see it and they can see it now anywhere they said, then, you know, they may kill me. They may, one guy said, they may hang me in my village by quarters and yell to my family, come get some meat. We just slaughtered a sheep. And so I said, okay man, I won't show your face. But like so, so, but anyway, so you served to meet these, these young Afghans and you start to see the commitment they have for their country, for what a better way of life. And it's just so inspiring. And then show it to me, make friends with soldiers and you know, all of a sudden you start to feel like you're part of the, of a, of a, of a group.

Speaker 1:          00:36:11       So you, you go out with these people and are what, what information do they give you about what's ahead? Did they say we're leaving, come with us. I mean, how do you know what's going to happen? Do you, are you privy to meetings? Like

Speaker 2:          00:36:26       yeah, so there's a process called the military decision making process. MDMP and it's when an order comes down from above that you have a mission, you sit and you do a big briefing and you do what's called mission analysis. And so the leadership of the battalion in this case task force, White Devil of the 82nd airborne that we were embedded with on one of these missions. Um, Lieutenant Colonel Paul Larson, the commander of task force, White Devil, um, we will call up mission analysis meeting. And so all of the leadership of the battalion 800 guys, but just the, the leadership would assemble and you would go through the mission, you would talk about it. This is what they want us to accomplish. This is the resources we, we think we need. Um, now I need, you know, all of us to go back and make a mission plan.

Speaker 2:          00:37:09       How are we going to move, you know, 200 guys, you know, 200 miles to the border of Pakistan. How are we going to set up shop out there for two weeks? What villages that were going to air assault based on intelligence that we can generate because they only have finite resources. So everything has to be, everything has to be, all, all operations are, are driven by intelligence. You don't just go somewhere on the hopes you go there because you have a reason to go there. That there's bad guys there, that there's routes there that they're moving explosives from Pakistan and Afghanistan. And so you do an admission analysis and then you know, everybody comes back together a few days later, you lay out the plan, you were fine. The plan, you do the location Scout, I call them location scouts, like a movie, like a movie. Cause I shot him like that.

Speaker 2:          00:37:54       But you, you actually go to the potential forward operating bases, you're going to strike bases, you're going to operate from you scout those you meet with the African partners that you're going to partner with because all these operations we want and we're joint operations Afghans and army next. And so you meet with them and then you come back and you, um, you run it by the general and you say, okay, we've done our homework. This is what we need. This is what we're going to accomplish. These are the risks. And the general looks at the plan and either of course as Jemilla's do either, you know, it says good no or tweak it and they usually say tweak it and you tweak it and then you're off and running. Then you're conducting the operation. Now

Speaker 1:          00:38:38       how did you decide on the amount of days that you went there and how many hours of footage did you have to go through to put together this six part? It's a six part docu series, correct?

Speaker 2:          00:38:47       Yeah. At six one hours. It's also on direct TV for any of you that may have at directv. The CEO Mike White, really quick. Um, I cold emailed him when I got home from Afghanistan and he decided to move out and make this, but I had 650 hours of footage and um, and you know, a lot of it was, you know, kind of dead end stories because you would go out on for a few days with different soldiers on different operations and nothing would happen. And it was just sort of a dead end opportunity that you couldn't develop. So

Speaker 1:          00:39:23       put any of that in there to show that there's a lot of frustration. A lot of these things don't pan out.

Speaker 2:          00:39:29       Not, no, we, we didn't put any dead ends in. We didn't put any dead in characters in let's say we, we, we, we put in all the characters that we wanted to and the missions that we wanted to show [inaudible] and sometimes there was conflict in those. Sometimes, you know, between soldiers you'll see that there's sometimes, you know, everyone has this perception that if you're in the army, you blindly follow orders. It's not the case. You may do that in front of people blindly follow it. But behind closed doors, you, you don't, you don't blindly follow anything when you're dealing with your life and the life of your teammates. The stakes are so high. Everybody wants to go home, you know, nobody wants to be the last person to die in Afghanistan. So, so we actually got to see that whole process of, you know, questioning a superior officer, whether he's doing the right thing or not.

Speaker 1:          00:40:20       So you got to see they, they, they do that in the face of a superior officer?

Speaker 2:          00:40:24       Not Typically in face. Typically behind the scenes they will, if they have to, they will if they have to, if it's in the moment and they don't have time, like in the moment if the guy said go jump off that bridge, I think he would confront him face to face cause it's imminent. Right. But if it's, if it's something that you can let slide for a moment and then go talk to him later, that's typically the way they handle it.

Speaker 1:          00:40:49       Now are you storing tapes? I mean how many, how many guys do you have over there that are filming and how are you getting this stuff back?

Speaker 2:          00:40:56       Yeah, so we're shooting, um, I have three camera teams plus me and so I would embed each camera team with different units doing different missions. Then I would rotate through the camera teams and so we would shoot on, on, on cards and we would back every night and have to backup our media to the hard drives, to rugged hard drives. And then we would, you know, have to charge our batteries because we would run out of batteries oftentimes if we didn't. And then we would send that media back every three, four weeks, we'd send a dump of footage back home. And in my editorial we'd ingest it and start, you know, organizing it, but 650 hours of footage. Wow. So did you have a Internet access when you're out there? Like strong inner access? Never strong satellite. But if you were like, you know, meet a major army base, like um, Kandahar and then you would have internet intermittently but not enough where you could upload footage to a server somewhere. No, very slow speeds. Wow. So you

Speaker 1:          00:42:00       dealing with hundreds of hours of footage then, and you've got to break this down to a six hour docu series and you have to do it justice and you have to do it justice also because not just because it's a significant part

Speaker 2:          00:42:13       of American history, it's the lives of these soldiers that you have become friends with and comrades with. But you're, you, you, you're trying to do this whole thing justice. Well. Yeah, I mean that's the reason to do it. I mean, the reason to do it is to do it justice, to do it right, to show the way it is, to not come at it with an angular is a spin. But just to tell their story and honor how hard they, what they do is, and to honor all those who served there and lost their, you know, it's you, you, you, I did it because I wanted to tell their stories. You know, and you don't do that for money. You don't go get shot at from money. It just doesn't work that way. You go to that because you want, because you feel it's important for the world to know who we are as a nation, who are army is and who the people are behind the army. The army is an amazing group of guys, Great Amazing Institution and people and I thought it was really important too to show who they are. They, they are the best of us. The best of America I think. I mean, they were some of the smartest, bravest, courageous people who, who are doing this because they, they, they feel a sense of love for their country, true love for their country and, and the values that we hold deal deer. And so I wanted to, to show she showcase that

Speaker 1:          00:43:51       they have a true love for our country and true love for the values. And what do they think they're accomplishing by being in Afghanistan? What is the primary sentiment that they think that they're accomplishing by being over there? By eliminating the Taliban, by weakening the Taliban, by empowering the local so that they can help reduce their area of the Taliban.

Speaker 2:          00:44:14       I don't think they even necessarily think about some of those things because they go where the president tells them to go. They go where our country orders them to go. Um, I think that's, it's a, it's, it's a more like personal kind of thing for them. And that is, you know, they, they're willing to risk it all, you know, they're willing to give everything, um, to fight the evil of our generation, radical Islam. And so, you know, they have commitment like you've never seen, like I've never seen. The commitment is phenomenal. You know, you think a suicide bombers committed and have a vehicle borne IED drivers committed and they are, but make no doubt about it. That, that, that our soldier that decides to walk towards the enemy close and destroy him is every bit as committed as, as that suicide bomber. Except we don't go to try to kill civilians like they do.

Speaker 2:          00:45:13       Right. We'd go to try to kill them, the enemy. And so I think that's where they, I think that's the message that I got from my experience there and watching them and I think that they're proud of is that they're willing to do whatever it takes. They'll go anywhere you asked them to. They, they, they just, they will. I heard soldiers say it as long as I've got my body armor and my helmet, I'll go where they have the hell you want me to. What do you think is a difference between the perception the average American has over here safely guarded, protected in, in our country? What do you think the misconceptions that most people have are about what's going on over there? What are the primary misconceptions? Um, that the Africans don't want us there at. The African people don't want us there. The Afghans want us there.

Speaker 2:          00:46:03       The locals want us, they're the ones that don't want, um, you know, radical Islam and Sharia law to govern the land. They want us there. And so I think that's the thing I didn't understand when I went there is, is how much the locals are grateful and thankful that, that we are there and that we've, we've done what we've done. I mean, I had Afghan officers in the army, thank me. I would say to the camera, I would point the camera at them and say, do you have any messages from America? And they would thank America's parents for sending sons and daughters here to die, for us to, to fix us, to help us. Like they really, really are thankful that we're there. And that's just something you don't get a sense of back here. Um, you know, one of the other things I'm most proud about the fighting season that I think you'll get to see is, um, you know, we show how the rules of engagement, um, work in ways, you know, when, when it comes to drone warfare, you know, there's a perception out there that like the u s military establishments out of control, that they're just sort of shooting missiles randomly it bad guys and don't care about killing civilians.

Speaker 2:          00:47:13       Well, I can tell you if you watched the fighting season, you'll see something different to that narrative. You'll actually see how it works and when they're willing to and when they're willing to not risk collateral damage. The, the real issue that people have is when they read just raw, when they read

Speaker 1:          00:47:30       the raw numbers of innocent civilians killed by drones versus the intended targets, and they're pretty heavily and on the side of innocent civilians killed. I think the last count was something like 80% that that's hard for people to swallow.

Speaker 2:          00:47:43       But here's the thing, you don't remember, the army is different than the CIA. It's different than any other branch of the military. That's using drone warfare. And I think that's an important distinction that we have to remember is that the US army fights according to its own. It's a, it's a set of values and principles that are different from other organizations that do that stuff. And I think that's one of the things about the fighting season is you're going to see how, how different they are.

Speaker 1:          00:48:15       Now we also have this conception of these, there's perception rather have these people sitting in a room somewhere with like an Xbox controller, no one near the action and they're controlling these drones and firing. If these black and white screens looking at night vision and a very nondescript images there, they're trying to determine whether or not these are the actual enemy. What is the actual reality of using those drones?

Speaker 2:          00:48:45       Well, I, I was never with the actual pilots of the drones. Where are those pilots? They can be local or they can be over here in the states. I mean they can be, they can be remote. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:48:57       how are they doing it remotely? Like if they do it remotely as it through the internet or is it through satellites

Speaker 2:          00:49:02       gotta be satellite? I would, I don't know. But I would think it's got to be sound light and it's instinct control like there's no delays. It's instinct control of the, of the, of the drone. But when I

Speaker 1:          00:49:11       be some delay, I mean there's a ping,

Speaker 2:          00:49:14       there must be something. But the reality is the guys I was, I worked with, I was with task force white devil when we were using drones. Um, so our guys would be watching the drone feeds and you would be looking on, you know, the enemy to see if you could pick up an RPG, um, or a weapon that's a prestige weapons system because it has to be sort of a, a higher level weapon system to make them a valid military target, let's say. So you would be looking at, at the drone feeds and then the guys would be typing and communicating with the drum pilots in a chat room. And so there's real time communication going on and real time coordination and realtime jags involved. John a judge advocate general's I'm involved in the process at this point of, you know, have you met the rules of engagement because there's different kinds of strikes to there's kinetic strikes, dynamic strikes.

Speaker 2:          00:50:12       So like if you're in, um, uh, troops in combat situation and you're the ground force commander and you're running a company and you know that there's an enemy fighting position by that rock, you know, theoretically you have the authority if there's no other assets available to get the drone to attack the enemy behind the rock as the ground force commander. But then there's other, other, um, kinds of strikes that are like preplanned, like you're going after a terrorist that has a known name and a known face. And so the rules of engagement for him will be different than the rules of engagement for the troops in combat rules of engagement. So there's all these different, and depending on where you're on and the list, how bad they want you is how much risk they're willing to take as far as collateral damage. Was there ever a time when you were over there where you second guessed your decision?

Speaker 2:          00:51:07       No, I, I never, I mean I, okay, one moment we just been in a troops and conduct, we just had like an hour fight with four different enemy fighting positions, about 800 meters north of us. And so we'd had about an hour gunfight from 800 meters. But the bullets when they zip overhead, they sound like they're breaking the sound barrier. And so there's like a sonic boom and you could see them playing in the dust all around you. And so, you know, all that's going on for an hour. And then we, we dropped B, one bomber flew overhead and we dropped, you couldn't see it but it dropped 500 pound bombs on the enemy and the firing stopped and you know, after about a half hour and the ground force commander, Captain Ray Adams said, let's go do a battle damage assessment. Let's walk over there. Let's see, you know, if there's any left.

Speaker 2:          00:51:57       And so at that moment, like when, you know, the platoon is strapping up to walk across 800 meters of open valley desert into this green zone, which is really thick vegetation where they can hide anywhere and there's mud walls everywhere. You know, I'm starting to think to myself at this point, like I have a great wife. I really liked to Panga. I like my, I like my wife. I like my kids, you know, I'm walking with this young platoon, you know, to this place where we were just in a fight. I said, why am I doing it? And I questioned why am I doing it and should I go? And then I thought, oh yeah, I should go, but why? And then I realized I was going because they were going and I had to tell people they were going. So I went with them.

Speaker 4:          00:52:45       Wow.

Speaker 2:          00:52:48       And so you get over there. And what was the damage assessment? Just pieces of clothing. Uh, you know, remanence of people. Um, no, you know, a couple guys hiding that we, that we found, um, had shovels in their hands. They put down their weapons. So there was nothing you could do. And um, as far as like, you couldn't prove anything. So I'll remember that. I remember this one, you know, big, Big Army Guy, I'll letting them and these guys came up to him and after, you know, cat madams question them, the Afghan army guys questioned, everybody knew that they were 99.9% Taliban. You know, they, they said that they didn't hear any guns, didn't hear any bullets. So you know what he talking about? The earth just shook from miles. Um, and we had a look and go and uh, as we let them go, they, they went up to try to shake my hand and I'm holding a camera. I couldn't shake their hand, tried to shake other people's hands. Some people shook their hands goodbye and they went up to this big sergeant and tried to shake his hand and he just said, you know, get the fuck Outta here motherfucker. I'll get you next time. And he was so pissed that we had to let them go. Those guys that just tried to kill his, his buddies, him.

Speaker 1:          00:54:04       And it's only because they didn't have their guns on them. Yeah. Wow. That's so weird. What a weird, weird war.

Speaker 2:          00:54:13       The Afghans look at us most and they must shake their heads sometimes because I mean, I know, I mean I, I think I know what would have happened if we weren't there of camera's weren't there. If the army wasn't there, they, those guys would have never walked out of there.

Speaker 1:          00:54:27       There was a time World War II when the United States had taken a lot of Nazi prisoners and had them in prisoner of war camps in America and treated them very well and it was a chest before they had found out how badly Americans were being treated over in Germany. And there was all these different stories of American, more prisoners being gunned down, firing squads. They would find their frozen bodies tied and bound and there was a big public outcry, congressional hearings, and they were trying to figure out why are we doing this? This is a tough time for America. Why are we treating these Nazi prisoners so well? And they're not reciprocating like what it, what do we do about this? And, um, they decided to keep doing what's right and keep treating the prisoners under the same standards of the Geneva Convention. And it's those, those regulations when things are horrific like that where it seems like where people are like, well, why would you do that? Why would you let them go to those? Those might be the only thing that keep a situation like war from breaking down and becoming even more horrible than it actually is. Agree. I mean, I agree. It sounds counter intuitive, right?

Speaker 2:          00:55:47       I agree. I agree. I mean, if you don't have those standards, then you know, then start, we'll start cutting their heads off, I guess.

Speaker 1:          00:55:56       Yeah, right. Yeah. We'll start making youtube videos. So,

Speaker 2:          00:56:01       but we luckily have those standards and you know, we're not them.

Speaker 1:          00:56:06       And that was, that was one of the main concerns about Guantanamo Bay that we weren't following the Geneva Convention, that we had said that we would, uh, we wouldn't do it for al Qaeda, that I'll kind of, prisoners would not be treated under the Geneva Convention. And the big concern would be what would happen if they catch our troops over there? What would they do to them to know the answer to that? Exactly. That was the whole idea of the Geneva Convention the first place. So even though like what you saw seems counterintuitive. I mean

Speaker 2:          00:56:41       it's Kinda how you have to do it well. Yeah. And the soldiers were frustrated and then of course they follow orders and they let him go and they just hope next time, like he said, I'll get you next time, motherfucker. They just hope next time you hold his gun a little longer so that you can verify with either a drone or with your own eyes that he was an enemy combatant. Wow.

Speaker 1:          00:57:02       Is there a time that stands out that was the most brutal or particularly brutal of all the different and firefights are different, different scenarios that you encountered?

Speaker 2:          00:57:15       You know, it was a time, it was a firefight that I wasn't there for. One of my camera guys was, was there and river was his name. And uh, he's from Oregon. He's a biker and a crazy guy covered in tattoos. And missing his front tooth, total hillbilly love river and um, and so river was in a gunfight with this young platoon and we were reviewing his footage and I saw a tracer go by him, like between us that far away and I just really got Kinda, it's so comb the reality that river almost got shot. And then there was another time when I had to get permission to descend bed. One of my cameramen from the U s army, Jake, uh, camera guy from Australia that I hired who lives there and I had a decent bed, him from the u s army because he was going on a mission with the Afghans.

Speaker 2:          00:58:04       When you say he lives there, do you mean he lives in Afghanistan, Kabul. Whoa. He's a war is a war journalist. She lives there all year round now he's moving to places where he can cover isis. He's an interesting guy. And so and so Jake had it in bed with the Afghans and I had to go meet with the general to get permission to get him in bed with the Afghans because there was no US forces on the ground where he was going. And it was a place called the Tangy valley, very dangerous valley. The side of the law, single largest loss of life of US service members at 38 died in, I shouldn't look a, that was shot down by RPG in that valley. And it was a really important mission because the Tango Valley is just outside Kabul, but it's a Taliban stronghold. So they can, they can plan their operations and attack cool very quickly from the tiny valley.

Speaker 2:          00:58:53       And so he was important that we told this story. And so I went to talk with general towns in and he said, okay, so you know, are you prepared to see your camera guy? Um, you know, in an orange jumpsuit on his knees, on the Internet because the place you're putting in, that's the kind of thing that happens and nobody is going to go get him. No, no US allies or us, we'll go get him. And I said, I haven't said yes. And that was like probably the hardest moment cause I had to make a conscious conscious decision. Right then just say yes. Did you express this to him? Yeah, I mean Jake, Jake knows Jake. Jake knew Jake's Jake. Did you tell him that? That was the sentence that was the way it was described to you? Yeah, I did. What did he say? No problem. Ricky and his cheerful Australian attitude. No problem. Wiki fucking Australians are crazy, crazy, crazy.

Speaker 2:          00:59:51       He's a bull. This guy, he's a boy. Wow. It sounds like a nutty dude. What it, what motivates that guy? Jay Gum was in the Australian army and I think he was involved with some, some event that was really traumatizing involving, you know, some kids getting hurt and killed. And so it was somewhere in Indonesia where the Australians were, I think. And so he ever since has been involved ever since that event. And they left the army. Um, he's been trying to tell the story of how war affects kids and so he's got a special focus on kids. And so that's, that's what motivates Jake I think. And he does this three 65. He's over there all the time. All the time. Does he learn yearn for a normal life? No, he actually learns for the next gunfight. He yearns for the next to gunfight. He, he's one of those guys, the chases gunfights around the world.

Speaker 2:          01:00:44       So he's covering isis right now. He's in with those dudes. The Christian militia is out there that are fighting isis right now. Wow. Wow. That is intense man. So how many, how many reporters or how many a cameraman rather do you have over there? There was, um, four plus me on j could only stay with us for about six weeks and had to leave. And then, uh, one of my camera guys was getting sick all the time. I mean, really bad, sick, dehydrated. Um, and so he couldn't leave the fobs, so he would cover sort of as a fob forward operating bases. And so he would cover like the drone story for me because that's in a controlled environment. And so we would, the other three we go out into the field with various platoons and stuff and operations and then he would stay back.

Speaker 2:          01:01:36       Was there anybody that you got close to over there that you lost? No, I didn't. None of our guys, um, were killed. So we killed Taliban. We didn't have any arg. Our guys killed their wife while we were with them. Uh, fortunately was that the first time you'd see the human body? Um, fully from act of war I'm in PR in the real flesh. Yah, for sure. What was that like was like the first time you saw it was, it's kind of gross is definitely gross. There's nothing pretty about it. It's, it's Har, it's actually its absolute heart. You can tell people died, violent deaths, pieces, pieces, missing chunks,

Speaker 3:          01:02:21       like ugly. Then you had seen all this I'm sure on the Internet. Yeah. And now the difference between seeing on the Internet and being there live, we're all comes home and you realize this is what they're trying to do. To the people that are around you.

Speaker 2:          01:02:37       Yeah. What did that feel like? It's not personal I guess is what I would say. You know, it's, it's not like they want to kill Joe. They want to kill Ricky. They want to kill what we represent, they want to kill what we live, what we are, what we live for, the values we hold dear. And so because of religious fanaticism, because, because I think according to an army, until officer I spoke with I thought was very knowledgeable because in order for, for their, for their, um, prophecies to come true, they have to start world war three and then their profit, we'll come back and you know, bring peace in order to the world. But he won't come back until they are able to trigger a big event, a massive event to start world war three. And so that's, that's the hardcore, hottest motivation.

Speaker 3:          01:03:35       There's a, there's a distinction there between the hardcore jihadist and the average person who's a Muslim. And this is what gets sort of turned around and churned around rather and debated back and forth in America when people start using the term Islamophobia because there are people that practice Islam that a very polite, peaceful people that don't want any harm to occur to anybody, and then there are radical people that are out of their fucking mind and want to shoot people for drawing cartoons. Yeah, the radicals. I mean even in Afghanistan, they'll pay a kid 25 bucks, 20 bucks to go plant an IED.

Speaker 2:          01:04:15       The kids not doing it necessarily because he wants necessarily to fight Jihad. He wants $20 he wants a pair of Levi's. He Wa he doesn't wear Levi's probably, but he wants something and he needs money for it and so that kids, not hardcore Jada, he needs money, but he dies like anybody else.

Speaker 3:          01:04:35       When you, when you, when you step over that line, it's incredible that the only way to really get someone to do something like that is religion. It's really the only way. It's the only way to get someone to blow themselves up. It's the only way to get someone to sacrifice their own lives. You have to give them this idea in their head that something better waits for them after they do it. And you have to have them really, really believe it. And there's only one way. It's gotta be religion. There's nothing else you don't know. One blows themselves up, her Ferrari's. You don't blow yourself up for diamonds because he can't. You can't. It doesn't work that way. Well, think about that. You sex, they use

Speaker 2:          01:05:11       promise of virgins. And that's a powerful basic urge of men sex. And so they must somehow use that in a twisted way to, to play on boys, teenage boys going through puberty, and they convinced them that they're going to have all the sex you want.

Speaker 4:          01:05:32       My Gosh. And you believe it.

Speaker 1:          01:05:37       Well, it's also, you're talking about people with limited education and they're very young. Those, those two factors together and culturally, the entire areas, Muslim. So it's not like the idea of not being Islamic is almost more foreign than the idea of being a suicide bomber.

Speaker 2:          01:05:56       Oh yeah. Especially when some of the suicide bombers or a mortars and revered with posters of them and tributes to them, you know, and

Speaker 1:          01:06:06       there was a school in Pakistan and a, there was a documentary on it or they were a training these young kids to become suicide bombers. And they had this sign on the wall that it, first of all, they showed all these images. They had these enshrined images of the children that had blown themselves up. And they had this, uh, this sign on the wall that said, today's students are tomorrow's holy martyrs. And, and they were explaining, you know, like what that meant and what it means to fight against the, the enemy. And it was, it was just so hard to watch. So hard to look at these young kids that were being indoctrinated into this way of thinking and knowing that this is a washed isn't, well, you can't fix that. You can't go over there now and, and fix those teachers, tell them they shouldn't be doing this, fixed the religious leaders to straighten the mindsets of the people, adjust their perceptions. You're not going to be able to do it. Like you're, you have a, an area of the world that's almost inexorably sick and it just, it is what it is and now we have to deal with it globally. You have to deal with the consequences of those people getting older and going out in the world and affecting people with the ideology that's been sort of embedded into their brain.

Speaker 2:          01:07:28       It's, that's popping up though worldwide Joe. That ideology is popping up in Canada and the US and Europe all through France. Look at Charlie Hebdo. Yeah. So it's like a cancer and that is spreading and it can grow anywhere from any mosque, from any teacher and it's going to take a global, global the whole world to fix it. I don't know how else, you know, we do it except, except it's a, oh it's a world effort to, to sort of show these people a new way and it's got to come from within them. It's got to come from within them.

Speaker 1:          01:08:05       Is there resistance in Afghanistan to religious fundamentalism? Are there people that are against like actively and vocally against Al

Speaker 2:          01:08:16       and against the Taliban? Uh, yeah. I mean there's, yeah, there's millions of people there that don't want Taliban rule and they're active and vocal about about it. There are, and there's a whole initiative where we're, you know, I think it's, I forget the movement, but it's like the anti Taliban movement and it's literally, you know, villages in remote places past June. Wally is, um, one of their laws, you know, but I think it's stems from that kind of culture where they're actively against the Taliban and resisting and fighting and you know, trying to, trying to try to create a new way for themselves. But it's a crazy place. I mean, it's a crazy place. Here's a story. So this guy was telling me he was an African and he was talking to me about how he knew of a story where one African man get killed another and the one who survived.

Speaker 2:          01:09:10       We went to the family of the one he killed and said, I asked for your mercy, forgiveness and protection. And so passion Wally means they have to do that. It means we got to take you, take you in, protect you, feed you, how's you, it's part of this cultural thing. And so they took him in and you know, took him the man that killed their son and or father. And he lived with them many years, you know, 10 years, 12 years, whatever. It was. Long time. And then he decided he was going to go home one day and I, you know, I spent a decade there. They must have forgiven me. They loved me by now. And as soon as he walks through the door, they killed him. And why? As soon as you walk through the door, they killed him. So as soon as he left, as soon as you said he was leaving, yeah, because, because then their obligation was, was fulfilled.

Speaker 2:          01:10:03       That's insane. So this guy had been with them for over a decade under their protection. They were feeding him. Yeah, because of this law. Right. And this is, what is it called again? Posh asked June Wally. And what does that mean? I don't exactly know, but I believe it means that we will protect and take care of you if you ask. Wow. So, so they did it until he left and then they killed him. That that's absurd. That's only, again, that would only take place in a situation where religion was involved, I would think. And then there's other stuff, man. It's just like Chai boys dancing boys. Yeah. What's that about? It's, it's a, it's a, it's a status symbol to have a boy and, and use them for sexual reasons. A status symbol. Yeah. You're a powerful man. If you have a boy. How old are these boys? Young? Six. Eight, 14. How common is this? It's pretty common if, I mean there's not that many chiefs, but if you're achieve

Speaker 3:          01:11:15       like a warlord. Yeah. Or even even less than that. Successful businessman. So, whoa. That's what I said. There's this weird stuff goes on there and, but this is not something that is prohibited. This is prohibited in Islam. I didn't dive into it. I didn't even want to research it. Homosexuality has prohibited.

Speaker 2:          01:11:36       I need more. I'm looking into it. I just heard about it and I heard soldiers talking about it and people that had seen it and yeah, I mean drinking's prohibited. Other things are prohibitive but you know, they, I think they do them.

Speaker 3:          01:11:52       Wow. So how, how is this defined? Like when you're, you're around these people and you see these guys with these six year old kids, like how do you know that it's not as son? How do you know which I was never in the presence of that cause I never saw that. I never saw that. So it's not that common. I don't know what percentage it is, but I don't think it's like, you know, I I'm going to guess 5% 10% that's a lot. Maybe I'm guessing, I'm guessing. Okay. Okay. Right, right. Wow. Yeah. Cause I had heard that from guys who would want over there and perform for the troops that, you know, they'd seen a lot of homosexuality like and a lot of the sexual abuse

Speaker 2:          01:12:38       women are for breeding boys or for pleasure is what statement that they say sometimes. Some guys, some Afghans and women are treated terribly, terribly, terribly. They're horribly under the Taliban, horribly stoned to death.

Speaker 2:          01:12:55       I mean, but even though I don't under the Taliban, there was a, uh, a woman beaten to death in Kabul a few months back because the leader in the church, whatever the church he was going to, uh, um, said that she burned a cron. And in fact he was like an argument they had. He and her were, she didn't like him charging. She had mentally handicapped woman. She didn't like him charging for trinkets that he was selling to people. And so he said, you know, you burned a cross on to people and they killed her. So women are not treated well there.

Speaker 3:          01:13:38       When you got home, when you did the hundred plus days there and go home and came back to your beautiful family and your beautiful house and Southern California, what was that like?

Speaker 2:          01:13:50       Oh my gosh. Um, it was confusing, really confusing at first, uh, months. It took a month to just feel normal. But I was so glad when I got off the plane. I almost kits the dirty gutter in lax because of all the problems we have here. It is such an amazing place when you from a place like that.

Speaker 3:          01:14:13       And so that was the initial feeling and then, and then, uh, it was sort of trying to just sort of, um, care again about the, the normal things in life, you know, caring about whatever it is, bills, um, your, your kids have issues or concerns that you have to learn to find important again because the things that you just experienced where like, well that's not so bad. Okay. So, okay, you just lost all your money. That's not so bad. Okay. You know, you just, um, okay, you just failed that you just got in a car accident that's not so bad. Your boyfriend just dumped you. What are you complaining about? Your bank accounts at zero, what are you complaining about? Like that was all that learning, relearning to care again about other people's frivolous things, but the big picture. But to those people, they're not frivolous cause they don't, haven't had just to that experience you had the lack of perspective.

Speaker 3:          01:15:11       Yeah. Yeah. I mean, the more intense the situation or the more intense experiences are, the more those other experiences seems so doll, which is why spoiled people that don't have anything go wrong. I mean, that's why they'll, they will get freaked out about something so minor and trivial. Yeah. Other victim of their own ignorance and, and success or trust fund, whatever you call it. But the reason why I bring this up is because in a lot of ways, that was you. I mean, you were a young my ass off for everything. You certainly did. That's never me. I didn't grow up with a silver spoon in my mouth. But you read of this show called silver spoons, but I worked right, but you were rich was a floor plan. You were a little kid with eating off a plastic spoons. Right. But you know what I'm saying?

Speaker 3:          01:15:54       A celebrity and a TV star. I mean, you were a huge star when you get there. You know what it takes, it takes an, a massive amount of hard work and dedication and perseverance to get there. Nobody's given it. So this perception that you know, somehow we live, we were privileged. C'Mon, we worked our asses off. I worked my ass off since I was five years old. Right? But what am I saying is you develop that way. I mean, you were famous. I saw you in the champ and I was a little kid. My Dad took me to see the champion. I remember crying when you were crying over John Voight's dead body. By the way, that fucking story that you told me about them being mean to you right before that to get you to cry. That is one of the most fucked up Hollywood actor stories.

Speaker 3:          01:16:42       Did anybody ever told me talking about my dead grandmother? Yeah, I'm can get you emotionally invested in that scene. I mean, it worked. It really worked. I mean, it was incredible. I remember leaving that movie theater fucking crying the Holy Shit. But my point being is you, you lived a life of privilege. You know a lot of ways. Okay. If you say so when it was a little defensive here for that, your privilege, when it's privileged or earned privilege, you earned where five earned. Right. You know what I mean? Earn world before Sorta, okay, you did your work, but I mean you're working in acting. Acting is not that hard. Do you think it's that hard being not a normal kids? Hard. That's hard. Going not to school's hard and not being on on softball, little league teams, hard, all sorts of things were hard, but definitely unusual but not Kabul. Hard knock. Cobble hard. Yeah. Not Cobble hard. So going from that to this and it at this stage of your life, the current stage of your life with all your life experiences, it boiling down to this, this docu series that you're putting together, which is probably the most intense thing you've ever done. Yeah. I mean, what a perspective enhancer that's got to be to go from being a famous child with this view of the world

Speaker 3:          01:18:10       and then as a grown man with a family to be over there in Afghanistan embedded for a hundred days, experiencing firefights on a daily basis almost. It was a great experience, Joe. And it changed me forever. It changed, it changed me forever in many great ways. I don't, I don't see any negative that has come out of it for me honestly. Um, except maybe wanting to do it again, you know, and you want to do it again. I mean that's, that's the risk is has it sort of lit a fire in me to like, well you did a fantastic job by all accounts on this docu-series I read reviews of it. People love it and they, they, they say this is really intense and really, um, what was the word that I'd read? But uh, comprehensive I think was the way they were describing it. Like you, you got deep into this. This isn't something you can cover in a 90 minute documentary, which is why you decided to stretch it out over six hours. Yeah, I mean we look at it from the ending of America's longest war from various perspectives. It's epic in scope, but we get deep inside those, those perspectives, you know, um, and

Speaker 3:          01:19:23       know I just, I don't know what the future brings for me right now because that's honestly the thing I'm most confused about is like how do I go back to, um, you know, certain career choices that I perhaps once was, you know, really excited about and wanting to achieve and goals enacting maybe in acting, even in films, in TV and even in production, even producing, you know, even writing, whatever it may be. Like, you know, I got to figure out again, I got to figure out what, what's next for me cause I have no fricking clue. No clue. Just because this experience was so intense and so powerful that it just sort of reshaped who as a person. Absolutely. Well I'm talking to from the time you returned mean I could tell that it was you. You had, there was almost like a rekindling of a spark inside of you.

Speaker 3:          01:20:15       Like you, you had this new sort of new feeling of importance of what you were working on. That was a very, very intense, absolutely. I mean I really felt, you know, that I was making a difference as opposed to just creating entertainment. Yeah. I really felt like I was making a difference, like, like educating people about the art of war, how battles are fought, the military science behind it. Like, because that's what I found interesting is how do you take an op order and operational order and then develop it and then execute it and then how do you overwhelm and destroy the enemy when you, when you finally find him, how do you overwhelm and destroy the enemy and choreograph the Cynthia destruction in the moment? How do you call in the air weapons teams, the Apaches, how do you call him the B ones and the fast moving jets, how'd he call him?

Speaker 3:          01:21:13       The artillery, how do you call all that and coordinate all that in the moment so that you can destroy the enemy as fast as possible. That's what I wanted to see. C and I and I found it and I, I'm going to show it to everybody. Do you think from here you'll continue to do documentaries exploring the military or will you start doing other things that interested? Because what it seems to me as your friend is that you, you just have to have something that excites you, something that interests you and then you just fucking dive in. Man, you go whole hog now. That's what you do. So it is, it's the only way I've ever known how to do it. As far as anything I've ever made is at worth anything. As far as, you know, any value has been something that I really was excited about doing and wanted to do and was passionate about. And so I, I don't know what's next for me. I mean, I love dogs and maybe I'll do something on dogs, you know, and smile a little more, you know, for while. Yeah, I love dogs. And they're great dogs are gray dog. Two of them.

Speaker 3:          01:22:19       I might need a break. Yeah. I'm going to Alaska, um, at the end of June going floating on a river and fishing with my, my son's and my nephews. That should be fun. 12 days. So that's kind of my break I'm really stoked about. And then I'll come back in July and 4th of July in Alaska by the way is off the hook. Yeah. You can get all the fireworks, all the big kinds you want and just go nuts. So that's what we're going to do. And, and then I'll hopefully figure it out, you know, but I know, I know I got to take my family into account. You know what they want because you know, I got a family. Yeah. Um, well you also have the freedom to make those decisions. You know, you have the freedom to decide

Speaker 2:          01:23:06       what you want to do and then really direct yourself towards whatever your passions are. Is there anything that you're interested in at the level that you were interested in? This military thing? Cause I think the military thing, you had always had an interest for it, but it was really sort of sparked by the series that you had done for the army that would, that really just, it's really my grandfather, it's sparked it like he was a captain in the army World War II and he took six what called deuce and a half flat bed trucks, big trucks with each one had two 50 calibers mounted on the backs. And so, um, he took six of those as close infantry support all the way through France to Germany, to the Rhine River. And I think I was the only person he ever told stories too. But I remember sitting at the feet of his chair, like as a kid growing up and he gave me all this memorabilia, gave me the dagger that he took off a dead Nazi mayor gave me his rifle that he, he carried, you know, gave me the things that is being at the things that he found treasures to him he gave me.

Speaker 2:          01:24:10       And so I think sitting at his feet, you know, sort of is what I'm

Speaker 2:          01:24:15       planted, that seed, you know, of, of the military. And I remember, you know, he would tell me about the green berets and the rangers and, and you know how they would paint their face black and they could move in the night and nobody could see them and they could just kill an enemy very quickly with their hands. Um, and he would tell me, stare stories about them. Germans stretching piano wire across roads. And so as you come down in a willys jeep and everybody's decapitated, they put it right at the height of your head. And so, you know, he told me about stories of coming across those places and you know, and then he, and then we started mitigating it by, by, by putting a steel rod at the front of the jeep to snap the wire before it, before he hit it. And so he would tell me all these stories about what he went through. And I think that's really where my interest came. And to answer your question, I don't know if I'm as passionate about anything, you know, besides my kids, my wife, and, and um, and um, you know, us the u s the u s and what we, you know, and the army that, that defends it. What's also got to be really hard once you experience something that is as intense as being embedded in combat in any crazy war like what's going on in Afghanistan, it's gotta be very difficult to find something that's going to ignite the spark to that extent.

Speaker 4:          01:25:38       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:25:38       Yeah. I'm, I'm, and that's one of the things I'm concerned about, you know, really I am, I'm like, what is next for me? What do I care about enough to do what I did this last time?

Speaker 4:          01:25:50       Uh, don't know.

Speaker 2:          01:25:54       So you just might be a war documentary guy now. I, I don't know if my wife can take that honestly. So I don't know. I don't know what's going to, yeah, and you kind of have to be over there. It's not like you just send people over there, film it, and then come back and edit it. I can't because as far as right now, like it was my, it was, it was my working with those units, those platoons and those leaders in the squads being there, that made all the difference because, because I, I think they understood, they understood my, uh, they could feel while I was there. And if it wasn't, if it's not the right camera guys, if it's not the right people in bed with those units, they'll shut them down. If they feel like you're doing something that will be critical of them.

Speaker 2:          01:26:45       Or are you paying them an unjust light? Yeah. If you're looking for dirt, right. A lot of them must be, they will shut you down. How many embedded reporters that they have over there? Not like, not like we did none. I mean we were the only team that was like this. They had people come from newspapers for three days, two days, five days, you know, go to one place, you know, and, but no, this was a massive, the army putting massive amount of effort into embedding five of us for three months, you know? And ultimately they'll just see, you know, like the ground force commander at those units at the unit level, if, if they don't want you there, there's nobody, no general that said you can come to Afghanistan is going to call up a ground force commander and say you will take these guys, you will show them.

Speaker 2:          01:27:32       It doesn't work like that because ultimately the ground force commander has his authority. He's the guy right there that's going to, you know that that's a keep you alive, that has to protect you, that's to interact with you. And if he doesn't want you, you're gone. So it's really tough to, to, you know, to think about how I could produce this without me actually at least going there to open the doors and to embed people. Right. But then when you went over there the first time to Scout, how many days did you go over there for three weeks? Three weeks for the first time. First Time. And did you come back from that three weeks with any apprehension? Um, yeah. I mean, I came back because I didn't have any, you know, I had to write a big check and I had to put my money where mouth was.

Speaker 2:          01:28:23       And so I had to get John Paul to write a check. And so you know, you invest your friend's money. That's tension. Now that apprehension about that Ma, you know, I never asked a friend to invest money in a project. I've always only invest in my own. And so why'd you decide to ask someone else? Because my wife kept telling me, Ricky, you need partners. You need people to work with, cause I'm kind of on my own a lot, you know, as far as, um, and so she's like, you need to collaborate with people. You need to work together with people. So I asked my friend John Paul and she got pissed. Why you asking our friend for money? I'm like, well honey, he's wanting me to work with people, collaborate with people, jump Paul's my friend and he gets the content. He's a big boy. He can risk the money.

Speaker 2:          01:29:01       He's worth billions. And she's like, yeah, but you've changed the dynamic between us and our friends. And I'm like, honey, it's going to be fine. I didn't know if was gonna be fine. But it was a great feeling when I came home and I, I wrote a check to him, I'll tell you that and paid him back. But I had apprehension about money. I had apprehension about, you know, all those things you think about like I had to buy life insurance for all my camera man. I had to buy death and dismemberment, insurance, disability insurance, you know, I had to make sure that their wives were okay with them going, you know, and, and their moms and their dads because some of the guys were young camera guys are not married. And so, you know, taking on all that responsibility. So I had lots of, lots of, um, lots of reasons to back out all along the process, but just pushed, pushed, pushed.

Speaker 2:          01:29:49       Did you edit the entire thing yourself? Me and a three story teams and my partner, Jim, retired, Colonel Raven. And so what we, what we did was we had three major in beds and we put a camera team, I, sorry, a story, an editor, Tina story producer and an editing editor on each team. So each team only had to learn, say 200 hours of footage. They didn't have to learn all 600 hours of footage. And so then each story producing team and editor would work with Jim and I and we would craft the episodes. And so I, I got, um, I sent, I came back from July, 2014 from Afghanistan. I tried to sell this to a different production companies, different networks throughout the entire summer and fall, couldn't make a deal with any of them because they really didn't want me to end up producing it. They wanted to bring other people to take it over and just sort of acquire the footage.

Speaker 2:          01:30:46       And so turned down some things that could have worked out for different deals and then went into February and had no, like, what am I gonna do with this? Like, I got a lot of money invested in this and I've got a lot of hopes, you know, I told the Army I was going to get it out, what am I going to do? So I emailed Mike White's Yoel, directv cold and him a link to the trailer. And then within 18 hours I had a handshake deal and you know, and that was in, um, February, middle, February. And I had 12 weeks or 11 weeks to edit six one hour episodes from all that footage and hadn't even started. Wow. That's not ideal. Right? It's not ideal. What would you rather, about how much time would you rather have? Uh, uh, maybe, maybe 16 weeks instead of 11.

Speaker 2:          01:31:34       Have you ever considered doing maybe a director's cut if this is really successful, would you, I mean, you have so much footage, it almost seems like you could do another six hours. Well, I never thought about it, but you're right. We could, we could do other things. There's so much that we had to leave behind. There's so much story there. Um, I mean, I can only imagine. We'll see. Um, it's going well. People are liking it. Some of soldiers, Joe on Facebook and sent me messages and said like, thank you for making this because now my wife and my family understand what I went through in Afghanistan or thank you, my son was in, in your series. Thank you for showing us part of his life, you know, really, really nice messages in. And to be honest with that was my goal the whole time was to make something that the soldiers would look at and say, if you want to understand Afghanistan, then watch the fighting season because it's the closest you'll get to war without going. There's nothing closer.

Speaker 1:          01:32:32       I can't wait to watch it. If there's anything else you need to say. Um, is there anything else you want to tell people about this experience? Yeah, yeah. You know what? We don't

Speaker 2:          01:32:41       army strong. The guys I was with were strong, motivated, you know, after 14 years of war. Now we have some really experienced leaders that have been deployed multiple times and been, it had been in this fight multiple times. And so that generation of experience is teaching the next generation. And, um, you know, I just want people to understand that, you know, a military may be having our army maybe having budget issues. I hear about in the paper, I may have other, other issues, but one thing, they don't have a problem with his leadership. The people that lead these young soldiers are like dedicated, trained, experienced leaders. And their goal is to take everyone else gets home. Like seriously, they're goal is to everything they do to mitigate risk as much as possible. So they keep those kids home and you can see it. That's why they train them.

Speaker 2:          01:33:33       That's why they're hard on them so hard. They want to take them all home. And so I just want to leave it with our army strong. You know, it's, it's strong and it's experienced and it's um, it's a privilege to have told their story and a thank you to all of the vets, whoever served and thank you to those families that let them serve because it's a life commitment. It's not like a job. It's like the whole family's involved. And where would we, where would we be without them? I mean, honestly, where would we be without them? We'd have a draft. We'd have, we'd have a draft. I mean, think about it Joe. We have a volunteer army that has been at war for 14 years. All volunteers. I heard, I think chairman joint chief of staff, Keith Mo not Mullane, one of the chairman said, uh, you know, an all volunteer army was never designed to be at war of 14 years. That's why you have conscripts and drafts and we don't need it because we have that many young people that are willing to go out there and do this and answer that call and show up. And I think that's just amazing.

Speaker 1:          01:34:45       And this is the perfect day to do this on Memorial Day. So thanks for coming in here. And uh, thank you everybody that's served. Thank you everybody that's serving.
