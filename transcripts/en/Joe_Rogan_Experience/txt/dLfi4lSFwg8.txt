Speaker 1:          00:00:03       If you hear those clicks, that's me typing. Ladies and gentlemen, I'm not the fastest typer in the world.

Speaker 2:          00:00:11       I get it done.

Speaker 1:          00:00:12       Uh, this episode of the podcast is brought to you by blue apron. Blue Apron is one of my newest and most favoritest. That's not a real word. Um, sponsors because would essentially is, is they send you all the ingredients for healthy meals and you cook them yourself by their directions, uh, with their recipes. Uh, all the portions are measured out perfectly along with spices and a detailed photographs that show you what to do and uh, all the, the various parts of the recipe. It's really interesting and it's kind of fun too cause cooking, you know, if you, if you get like a recipe book and then you have to go to the store, you have to buy the individual ingredients, you have to measure them and weigh them and all that stuff that that's a lot of extra work. That blue apron sort of cuts out and they also provide you with a wide variety of different meals to choose from, which makes it, which makes it interesting.

Speaker 1:          00:01:11       It becomes like a little bit of a project, which I think is fun. Um, but really, really yummy foods like coconut curry, salmon steaks, um, Swedish meatballs with braise, Kale, stuffed cabbage rolls. I've eaten several meals from them so far. They, there the amount of calories that you get from these meals. Also, it's, it's pretty surprising. It's 500 or 700 calories. It's just very low for a really yummy, delicious foods, but they're all prepared and designed by people who really know how to make Yummy, delicious food. Uh, it's not hard to do. I'm not a great, great chef, obviously. Did I have to say that? It's like saying I'm not a doctor. Uh, I'm not a great cook. I know how to cook a few things, but this blue apron thing, I find it fun. I find it like a little bit of a project.

Speaker 1:          00:02:00       You know, it's a lot cheaper than ordering out. You can get everything is $9 and 99 cents per meal. That's all the ingredients in the exact right proportions with simple recipe instructions right to your door. And like I said, there's a wide variety of things that they're going to send you and things to choose from. It's really delicious. It's very healthy for you. Incredible meals.

Speaker 3:          00:05:58       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:06:00       Experience.

Speaker 3:          00:06:07       I got to figure out a better way to do commercials cause it's always weird with two, two people at a three or just sitting there

Speaker 1:          00:06:14       and one person is talking to doing a bunch of money. It creates an uncomfortable air in the room. I'm all right a little bit. Right. It's a little odd. Um, Buddhist Geeks, somebody sent me a link, I guess it was probably a couple of weeks ago on Twitter to you guys. And right away I went, oh, this could be interesting. A convergence of what'd you say? Spirituality, Buddhism and technology. That's what you see and Geeks which always is somehow are connected with um, impairment and vision, which is very strange, right? Like being very studious and intelligent is connected to your eyes are fucked. Like every, you know, I mean you're looking at screens all day, I think. Is that what it must be? Right. Because as I've spent more time in front of a computer, my eyes have steadily gotten worse. Um, but your, your image, the logo is the Buddha with glasses on. So even the divine are not immune to the perils of LCD screens. True enough. Is there a better way around this to, to, uh, to do something where it doesn't completely destroy your vision? Maybe clairvoyants get developed that capacity. That's the only way. But reading does it too, right? Cause we've always associated reading with or is it just getting old and we're just blaming it on a bunch of other shit.

Speaker 4:          00:07:31       Could be that, but I, I think it's staring at things up close. You know, there's just, I think the eyes just get used to staring at things up close and then they can

Speaker 1:          00:07:39       just can't see far away anymore. That's my theory with me. It's the opposite though. My up close vision is starting to suck my, my vision, like looking at you guys at this distance is fine. It's perfect. That might be age then. Yeah, taking the age because also because when I put on reading glasses, um, things just get sharper. I'm like, oh, that's what things really looked like. You know? Like, I could read everything without the glasses, but then when I put them on and see like the, like if you know, you look at pages, you can see the actual detail, the texture and the paper itself. That's all gone to me. That's all gone in the real world. What is Buddhist Geeks? What are you guys doing?

Speaker 4:          00:08:15       Well, we started, um, several years ago as a podcast doing this kind of thing, talking to people and I'm really, in the beginning it was just my sort of early twenties rebellion against the Buddhist tradition. And I wanted to talk to people that weren't part of the mainstream Buddhist world, but had something cool to say. I thought. So we've just basically started by talking to some different rebels, a lot of Gen Xers who are kind of coming up as, as teachers and um, meditation experts are masters. And it sort of started there just as a kind of whim project, uh, with a couple of friends and then people responded. So he kept doing it and we felt a sort of obligation to continue exploring Buddhism, technology, culture, the way it's globalizing. And we just sort of from there, I've just been on a sort of eight year odyssey, uh, and Emily recently, about four years ago, kind of join the team and we have visited in the mom and pop thinks and I love it.

Speaker 4:          00:09:14       I love that that Buddhism has rebels. Absolutely. What is the main, what the main thing that people fight, not fight against but rebel against with Buddhism? I think it's like most religions, you know, there's some aspect of just rebelling against people telling you what to do or, or the feeling that, you know, this system of beliefs is telling you how to live or what to do with your life. I think that's part of it is just kind of breaking apart dogmatic structures and sort of saying, hey, actually we can make this our own and figure out how to do it ourselves because we're the ones that are interested in it. So we have to sort of take ownership of that. And so there's a bit of like, I guess generational pushback, you know what I'm saying? Actually, we don't want to meditate like the hippies dead, you know, we don't want Lotus flowers and incense, you know, we want like our computer screens and meditation apps.

Speaker 4:          00:10:06       You know, we want to do it the way it makes sense to us. What is that an effective way to do it? Like Meditation Apps? Is that real? Is that legit? Are there like some recommended meditation apps? They was better than traditional forms or an alternative I should say to traditional forms of meditation. I think there are, yeah, there's some good ones. I think they're good to start. I mean as soon as you start really getting into it though, then it's useful to, I think still meet space has the upper hand over the APP space. Interesting. Yeah. But I, I'd recommend beautified. That was one that Emily and I contributed to. And it's a, it's a modern mindfulness on the go APP. So it's sort of teaches you how to meditate in different contexts. Like if you're at the gym or if you're, you know, on the tube. Um, you wrote one for working on the computer. Yep.

Speaker 5:          00:10:51       Never heard a couple of her working on the computer. So it's really just about trying to bridge like what we're doing already in our lives with a meditation practice and these ancient traditions that have come down.

Speaker 4:          00:11:02       What do you, what is the APP for working on the computer? What does that entail?

Speaker 5:          00:11:06       Beautifies the APP and then the couple of meditations that I wrote, it's just simple things like I'm bringing your attention to different kind of anchor points. For example, you know we all usually have some sort of touch screen mobile device and so you know, you can use your, use it to bring your attention back as you swipe it, you know, back and forth with your finger. So it's just something, you know, it was very simple to return to so that you know, consciousness and the mind can start to just kind of settle so that

Speaker 4:          00:11:36       you're more aware and five being more aware. It makes a lot of difference. When you say more where you mean, um, cause a lot of people kind of scattered there. They're all over the place. And Dave took one minute. They were on, you know, all kinds of different apps. Do you name one? Is Facebook the devil?

Speaker 1:          00:11:54       No, I do sometimes. Yeah. There's no meditation in Facebook though. Correct? Not yet. Not yet. What I think Facebook's into it, it's a fascination with social interaction. Right? That's what it is. It's just this thing where, you know, I read this piece was talking about the origins of gossip and what, what, what gossip is all about, why so many people are into celebrities and celebrity gossip, the Kim Kardashians stuff and that kind of thing. And the big thing being that our culture doesn't have the same sort of communities that it once had these tribal bonds that expanded from 50 to 150 people to cities of 30 million. They're, they're very confusing for our biology apparently. Absolutely. And so, uh, that's why people gravitate towards what seems to be really a name like this, this, this pull towards, oh my God, she left him and he went up with her and oh goodness.

Speaker 1:          00:12:53       You see those magazine covers, you just want to grab them. And people who have no part of your life at all. You shouldn't be caring about them even remotely, but for whatever reason you're, you're compelled to do it. This is a little bit of that with the Facebook thing. Right. I totally agree. When I read a great article that said, in some sense Facebook brought that experience of living in a tribal village back as a technology. Marsha Mcluhan and his whole sort of theory about every technology brings something back from the past. Yeah. Mcluhan has, one of my favorite all time quotes is that a human beings are the sex organs for the machine world. Ooh, Ooh. Yeah. That's the greatest ever, right? That is one of the all time greatest quick JBS Haldane ains not only does the universe queerer than you suppose it's queer than you can suppose.

Speaker 1:          00:13:38       That's my number one favorite, but number two right up there. Nice cause it is a, I mean McLuhan was right. What are we doing? We're making, we're making computers and we keep making better ones and we keep, we were essentially the evolutionary device that that causes the, the, the things that we've created to accelerate far quicker and innovate far quicker than biology ever has a chance to. And in the process, we're also, it seemingly, at least on the verge of creating some sort of an artificial biological life. Some, whether it's biological, I mean, I don't know what you call artificially created cells that interact with each other the same way human cells do. But we're pretty pretty God damn close. Whether it's a hundred years or 200 years, pretty close to making artificial people. And where's that coming from? It's coming from people. If they are machines, biological machines, McLuhan, we'll be right. And then a new life form will be birthed out of our greasy little hands, not ours, obviously. Yeah, I think that's right. I saw Elon Musk on Twitter a couple of days ago, said, uh, increasingly looks

Speaker 4:          00:14:51       like we're going to be the biological boot loaders for a digital super intelligent.

Speaker 1:          00:14:56       Yeah, most likely there's a bunch of people that don't believe that's happening. I read this interesting article on Kurzweil. The guy was very critical of Kurzweil and uh, he was, uh, I think this guy is like sort of, um, he's a curmudgeon a bit. He's an intelligent guy. But his criticism of Kurzweil was basically a biological criticism of that. Our understanding of the human mind is already, uh, it's fairly limited in terms of like how the human mind processes various hormones and neurotransmitters and proteins and that are, there's no way we'll be able to recreate that because our ideas of human, of the human mind, the biological mine are still constantly evolving and changing and growing and that we're not really ready yet to duplicate the human mind. But my take on that was that we, we don't have to duplicate the biological functions of it to duplicate the actual functions of it is if they figured out a way to make something that not only mimics the memory banks or the, the, the memory access of the human mind, but is much better than it does it in a completely different way and non biological way.

Speaker 1:          00:16:08       And they can figure out a way to download intelligence or download consciousness or memories into that bank. Well, we're not going to really need this, this whole idea of cells and proteins. And I mean that that is, those are the components of the biological machine. But if we can make a better version of that and, and do it like some sort of a synthetic version or some sort of an artificially created version, it doesn't seem to me that we're going to need to know everything about the human mind in order to recreate its processes. Right.

Speaker 4:          00:16:38       Does that make sense? I mean, it makes sense. I, uh, I feel like I'm not enough of a specialist on artificial general intelligence to really know the different, the problem is, I don't think anybody is,

Speaker 1:          00:16:47       I mean, there's a bunch of people that are working really hard at it, but no one's ever done it. So if you haven't done it, who's the hell? How the fuck are you an expert? I mean if, if there's not an artificial human being that is, um, you know, state of the art version 7.0, uh, capable of compassion, understands its actions, hopefully it will be, well, it has to be right. Otherwise we're going terminator style. That's right. Right. That's the real question now. Sort of like the way we did nuclear power before we learned how to shut off nuclear power plants. Like I hope they don't do that with artificial intelligence. Like, wow, let's just get this thing up and running and then we'll figure it out. A way to give it emotions.

Speaker 4:          00:17:25       Mm. Yeah. No, I mean that's what scares me a little with the AI stuff is that it's so much focused on the rational thought process and yet, you know, my experience of being human is that that's barely part of my human experience. Occasionally I'm rational, I have thoughts, but mostly I'm just like reacting to things and emotional and, you know, I don't even know what, what it's running most of my processes. Yeah. That is an issue.

Speaker 6:          00:17:50       Right?

Speaker 5:          00:17:50       Yeah. And I think it's also interesting to see just bringing a little bit of the feminine perspective and it's like, I'm very conscious of like, you know, childbirth and some of these pro, you know, natural things that are on my mind a lot. And so thinking about merging the technology or creating some sort of artificial intelligence, it seems to me that a lot of these conversations start to navigate really quickly towards getting out of the body. And so I, you know, wonder if there is some sort of bridge between, you know, we're going to create something new. And at the same time, like you were saying, like infusing that with wisdom and compassion and some of these biological processes. Are we ever really going to get out of that? I don't know that it's just an underlying assumption a lot in these conversations that I think is interesting.

Speaker 6:          00:18:38       Yeah. It's fascinating because the, the, the general idea of the human body and the, the needs of the body, whether they're the needs for food or the need for the human touch of the need for, uh, the need to breed, all these different things will be completely unnecessary if we're no longer biological and what, what is causing war? What is causing greed? What is causing jealousy are these ancient monkey ideas that are stuck in our genetics, these mechanisms that have sort of forced us into the future, that forced competition. They forced us to cope and adapt. They forced us to learn to interact with each other. And this, along the way we've sort of developed this, these methods for managing the biology and meditation being one of them. Meditation and mindfulness and trying to be centered and being the president has sort of emerged because so many people are like, wow, am I fucking head's all over the place?

Speaker 6:          00:19:41       And this is, hey, this is what I've learned. If you just do this and say, this is where I am, this is what I'm doing. All of this stuff is nonsense. I concentrate on this and this I can get things done with. But if I live in the past and worry about all of the mistakes that I've made and allow them to define them, allow them to define me, rather they can be very limiting and they can really ruin your perceptions in a sense or flavor. Your perceptions in a very, uh, a unsatisfactory or a very unwelcome way or your, your day can be burdened by the past or you could be in the PR like these. All these things are sort of designed to allow us to navigate the biological waters, right? To, to figure out what is the push and pull of this machine. Like why is this machine jealous? Like what's going on here? Why is this want me to be upset at someone else's success? Why does this want me to be upset that someone is attracted to someone else other than me? Why does this want me to be upset at someone else's house or someone else's, you know, family or whatever it is that is tweaking you. What, what's

Speaker 1:          00:20:48       going on in here? Well, it's the machine wants competition because the machine has gotten you to 2014 where a million years ago a monkey crawled out of a hole and a figured out a way to draw an Arrow that points towards where the food is the other monkeys. Oh that way you could be like, aw, I see what you're doing. And then those ideas compiled and they piled on to other ideas. And before, you know, what a million years later, we have a civilization and complex civilization that has all these different influences that have led us to this point. But a lot of them are biological. A lot of the, the very motivations for doing most of what people do on a daily basis are very biological. When those are eliminated, it becomes a real question of like what's life, what exactly are we? And if we reproduce through test tubes or whatever the hell it's going to be, you know, when we become more, you know, three d printers or whatever it's going to be when we become biological, um, copies or artificial biology, like what, what are we and what is life? Yeah. Those are really important question gas. I guess. I think

Speaker 4:          00:22:00       one thing I thought was interesting as I got into the transhumanist stuff, you know, while back was that, you know, they use this term mind uploading to kind of predict, you know, we'd be able to upload our consciousness into the cloud and stuff like that. But I thought it was interesting that later I realized they never then use the term body downloading. So why is it that you can upload your mind to the cloud but you can't then download your consciousness back into different kinds of bodies. And I think it speaks a little bit to what Emily's saying, that there's a lot, a lot of the shadow of the geek culture is a disdain for the physical body and a disdained for limitations, which I totally understand because you know, I think there's part of us that wants to transcend the limits of being human.

Speaker 4:          00:22:43       You know, and it's the same thing that drives the Buddhist meditators to seek for enlightenment in its to realize this thing which is beyond in some sense the limitations of the human experience. And yet, you know, the real mature expression or realization in the Buddhist tradition is to realize that and then to return back into your incarnated physical form and to fully inhabit it. So I hope that the transhumanists in the folks that are building these, you know, seeds of digital superintelligence realize that even if we're able to upload our patterns into the cloud, we still, if, if, if they're still beings who have a sense of, of themselves and, and have some sort of physical substrate, whether it's carbon or silicon, that they're still going to have to deal with certain issues of incarnation, of being in a form of physical form of some sort.

Speaker 4:          00:23:37       Even if it's a very loose digital, you know, very fast flickering at form, they could still, there's still something there and there's still some sort of reference point. And I think that's where the Buddhist tradition has something to say, even about super intelligence and what that experience would be like. Because as long as there's a form and as long as there's an identity, right, like a reference point, uh, me, then there's going to be certain kinds of issues that we can't get rid of. Like then I have to deal with you and have to deal with these other youth. And I then there's things are objects outside of me and some of them I want and some of them I don't want and some of them are just going to ignore. And so even if I were a superintelligent consciousness, which I can't imagine because my imagination so limited, um, I, I still think there will be some amount of fundamental dissatisfaction that's built into the experience of being an individual who has a reference point. And I think that's in some sense what the Buddhist path is about seeing clearly is that most of our existential suffering and despair comes from this fundamental experience of being a separate being who exists on this side of my body.

Speaker 6:          00:24:50       But isn't the experience. I mean if you really stop to think about true enlightenment and being completely and completely in the moment, it doesn't that exist in the animal kingdom exclusively. I mean that's the only way they exist. They exist completely in the moment in a sense that is the most biological of all creatures and that that's a creature that has no existential issues. They, they don't have any angst in terms of their future or their past. They, they, they live and exist completely in the moment. So isn't it just our awareness of the futility of this existence? That's part of the problem because along the way we're innovating, we're expanding, we're growing, we're, we're doing all these different things. We're going to biohack and conferences and whatever the hell you're doing. But at the end of the day, you live and you die. You have a very short window here and it's like, what are you supposed to be doing, I suppose to being joining it?

Speaker 6:          00:25:48       I supposed to be leaving it better for the people that come after you and what's their poor purpose? Like why leave it better for them? And what, what are they doing? They're just leaving it better for the next, at the end of the day, what are we doing? We just enhancing this giant super organism known as the human race and for what purpose? Because we're helping it pollute because we want more planes in the sky. We want better cell phones. Like what? You know these, this, the existential angst of being, of being conscious, of being able to recognize that this is kind of like at the end of the day, like what? This is just a weird little trip you're on. You know you're on a birth to death trip and if you become something that's not human, if you become something that's not burdened by biology, is not burdened by sexual urges or, or any of the petty urges of, of modern human and a life that we

Speaker 1:          00:26:44       all struggle with. What, what exactly are you here for? What exactly is going on? And motivation might be the number one problem with artificial intelligence and it might not even be compassion. It might be that artificial intelligence becomes so intelligent. So it's like, what the F we're not doing shit. Okay, I'm not doing nothing. Why would I do anything? Like why would I expand? Why would I move on? Why would I make more of me? Why would I do anything? Why would I explore galaxies? I don't even have ovaries, you know, I don't have a mind. I don't have a sense of of futility. I don't have a beginning and an end, an end. I can make another one of me with a button like what am I doing? Am I going to go see the top of, you know, the Grand Canyon for what? For what purpose? What am I going to, I'm going to get fly in a plane and go to Paris. Why? What do I go? Shit. I don't have any desire to learn. Like there's no urge to improve and innovate. I'm not biological anymore.

Speaker 1:          00:27:48       Like what is created? Everything that we have, everything that we have, every, every building that we've ever made, every work of art that we've ever created is essentially this thing inside human beings that wants us to innovate and create this, this, this thing that has allowed us to radically reshape our environment that has allowed us to design cities and pieces and pieces of art and pieces of architecture and all these different things that we've created has all come from that same desire, that desire to continually improve. But if, if the human body, if we transcend it with some sort of an artificial creation and we've become far more enlightened, intelligent, the, the ultimate question will be why?

Speaker 5:          00:28:34       Well, I would say the ultimate question for me would be who are we? Yeah. What are we, what you're, yeah. Or what, because you know, when, when I'm listening to you talk about this and I'm like, Huh, there's a part of me that's like, no, like, let's not do that. And then there's this other part of me that's like, yeah, that desire to create and that desire to move forward. And the evolutionary impulse in us all is so strong. And that's what makes us so beautiful. And so when I have really touch into the mystery of it all and the beauty and the wonder and what you're talking about with the art, to me it's like not such a question of trying to get out of this anymore. It's more like a question of how can we use these technologies and the things that we are learning through science and the natural laws of things.

Speaker 5:          00:29:20       Because honestly, if we start to violate much more of our natural laws, our oceans are going to rebel and like our earth is going to become unstable. And we're seeing some of that. So we do have to balance the biological component with the evolutionary impulse. And one thing that comes to my mind is a philosopher Ken Wilber talks about transcend include a lot. So what if, you know, part of what we're doing is learning how to transcend some of our limitations as human beings. And at the same time include some of those limitations, um, that keeps us grounded. Um, I think that's really important as well. Transcend and include.

Speaker 1:          00:29:58       Yeah. I just wonder what would happen if we eliminated all of our biological urges and would things just completely stop? Why would anybody create art if we don't want to impress other folks? Well, if I think of, we have a choice, maybe some, some individuals would choose to do to eliminate those things and maybe some would choose not to. Right? Yeah. Well, if there's like a huge diversity and it's not just one thing that we become, what if it's like many things and people just kind of decided to go off and reprogram their consciousness and various ways why? I've always been fascinated by this idea of constant improvement and it's sort of what fuels modern corporations. This idea of constant growth is it fuels human beings. Like no one is happy with where they are. They want a bigger house, they want a better car.

Speaker 1:          00:30:52       They want, you know, if they're an artist, they want to create their latest, greatest masterpiece. They don't want to sit on their laurels. They want to consistently, constantly improve. Where's the iPhone six I'm still waiting. I'm waiting. I'm like, yeah, we have this consistent, constant need for improvement. And that is essentially designed in into the evolutionary process itself. Like that's what led single celled organisms to divide, become multi-celled organisms to get out of the ocean, to seek land, to seek shelter, to seek improvements in, you know, altering its environment in order to protect itself from predators. It's, which led us to the 21st century to where we are today. Having this conversation that somehow, I don't know if you understand it, but I don't understand how my voice is being processed down into ones and zeros and pump through the sky and people are getting it on their phone right now is they're driving in their car.

Speaker 1:          00:31:43       This is madness. This is a mad, mad, mad world. And what is the, what's the urge behind all of it? Well, it's this biological need for innovation, this biological need for constant improvement and it's, it's designed in the evolutionary process itself. I mean, it's a part of the evolutionary process. I mean, why? Why do animals evolve? Why don't they just say fuck it? If these fish keep grabbing us, let's just, uh, let's just stay the same color and go extinct. No bugs you like start looking like, have you seen caterpillars that like look like predators they have did develop eyes on their backs so that they can look scary so that less animals eat them? Or at least they have gotten to that point where that design, I mean, I don't know how you can ever really, truly, completely explain some of these butterflies that have these elaborate images that have sort of throughout, I mean, how many hundreds of thousands or millions of years of evolution, but it's, it's incredibly fascinating that they've developed this need to figure out how to trick animals so that they can continue to breed.

Speaker 1:          00:32:53       They've improved, they've innovative and that's that. If you could really talk to a butterfly and go listen to it, you only live a week. Why fucker? What do you care? Like if you die or your relatives die, what kind of a bullshit life is this? You know, you live a week, you fly around, people go, Ooh, look at the butterfly. And then it's over. Like, let a bunch of lizards eat you. Let's, let's just get this over with. Let's, you know, come back as a better bug figure out how to exist as a microbe inside the body of the animals that are eating you and then develop from its poop into some magical plant that enlightens the people that eat it or something. But living as a butterfly is bullshit, but they don't think that way. There's just this, it's part of this process is continue to innovate, constantly push forward, make things better. If we stop being biological, does everything just stopped? Does everything just eh, and did you know what, what is the conversation then? What if you don't have a motivation? If the, you, you don't have an expiration date, if you don't have people's, uh, sexual choices to appeal to if you don't have people's social choices to appeal to. If you don't want people to like you, if you don't have any desire biologically, what's the motivation?

Speaker 2:          00:34:11       Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:34:11       Well, I mean, obviously this is highly speculative in a way. Yes. But, um,

Speaker 2:          00:34:17       hm.

Speaker 4:          00:34:18       Maybe I'd just throw in one piece. Sure. Okay. Kind of bring it back down to the, um, to the analog version of, of intelligence, which is, uh, these human bodies sitting here having this conversation. Um, if that's okay with you. Um, I, I'd say there's another piece that's really important in what you're saying. There is the drive to innovate and to transcend, but then I think there's also a very powerful force that moves in the other direction and I would call it compassion or care or love. And it's that part of us that wants to include everything. Like Emily mentioned, transcending and including, you know, we can become better and better and better, but what good is it if everyone else has left behind, you know, what good is it if we're, you know, living, living the high life and there are millions of people who are struggling to feed themselves, um, you know, at some level when we get in touch with the reality of that there's part of us, if our hearts are open, you know, that really resonates with the pain of that and wants to include and wants to respond to that suffering into that difficulty.

Speaker 4:          00:35:27       And I think that's part of the reason life exists as well. It's one of the primary reasons is not just to transcend, but it's also to care for and to respond to the needs of, because we realized it's not just about us. Like it's not just this experience that's important. There are the, all these others, you know, that are also having an experience and they're not unlike me. You know, there, and that's why compassion can can exist because I realize like your experience is not unlike my experience. There's a way in which we have this common, um, hardware wetware this common sense of consciousness. I assume this, you know, calm, common hopes and fears, desires. Um, and so in that sense, you know, I think compassion is a really powerful force that also holds life together and keeps it from fleeing apart into the, into the ethers.

Speaker 1:          00:36:19       But the cynical objective amongst us would look at that and say, well, that's just a mechanism. In order to keep society together to allow this consistent innovation, you, you need people to stay together in order to get people to work together in order to get the maximum amount of productivity out of the human mind and creativity. I mean, there's no, there's only one way they have to love each other. If they don't love each other, they're not going to build shit. They're not, they're going to go live like Ted Kaczynski and hide up in the woods and a little shack and try to stay away from each other as much as possible. Part of the reason why we do so well is because we have compassion. So it could certainly be considered an evolutionary device to ensure innovation and constant growth. And it has, I mean, every society that has done well has been a society that cherished its members.

Speaker 1:          00:37:08       If you don't give a fuck about your members, you get a North Korea type situation where there's no innovation. The, the, the, the country stagnant. Everyone lives in fear. The lights are off at night. And that's a worst case scenario for a modern culture. And that model that is based almost entirely on the, those same ideas that like the, the lack of compassion for your fellow beings exhibited. Like if you looked at the one thing or you ask me, what's the one thing that troubles you most about a brutal dictatorship like North Korea, while the poor people that live there, the poor people that are suffering, that lived there, our compassion as a part of what makes us, it's a, it's a, it's a component, a critical component, which makes us successful.

Speaker 4:          00:37:50       Yeah. And I think, you know, you can look at it from that perspective, but I think there's other ways to look at it. Um, which has that compassion in and of itself as a good, you know, that there's something inherent in the experience of compassion of the open heart that's responding to suffering, which is in itself good. And that hum, you know, when you experience and touch into that space which completely dissolves cynicism, um, in, in the moment of it. Um, there is, uh, there is this feeling of this is this is right. Like this is right to respond to the difficulty of other beings because on some fundamental level we aren't separate from each other and in some fundamental way, the level of the, of the universe itself, you know, everything arose out of this momentary big bang, right? That's our current story about it.

Speaker 4:          00:38:39       Like, okay, what the fuck was that? Where did that w w what was that? That it all came from this nothing, this infinitely small point in space actually, you know, the Big Bang isn't something that happened in the past. It's something that is happening right now. It's something that the, that which was prior to the universe is still here and that is also our nature and that nature is naturally compassionate. It naturally responds. It naturally includes everything. So I think there's something in us that also wants to reunite with our own deepest heart and our own deepest mind, but does it right

Speaker 1:          00:39:13       really? Because if that's the case, and how do you, how do you factor in predators? How do you factor in the, the, the constant competition in the wild that exists everywhere. Compassion really only exists when there's safety. So the only time that exists, when would you know, when you worry about your own existence constantly, it's like this rabid sort of primal struggle. What all that is put to rest and you build up walls and you have a fire and you can hold each other and everyone's together and fine. Then there's the the room and need for compassion. But with the Eagle and the fish, there's no compassion.

Speaker 5:          00:39:52       I think you're speaking to our habitual patterns that get ingrained in us as we grow up. And with the Buddhist training that I've been through, it really does teach us how to start to deconstruct some of that training. I mean, compassion naturally arises in a moment's notice without there being this strong sense of like contraction around our small sense of self. You know, when your child reaches for the stove, you're going to try to jerk it back because you don't want it to burn itself. Right? That's a level of compassion does naturally arising

Speaker 1:          00:40:23       well. That's, that's also being, uh, you're in a mentor role. You're teaching this human being about things and it doesn't understand yet. Yeah. I would think of more of compassion as someone you have no biological connection to at all and you see them in need of help and you help. And there's something that's inherently satisfying about that. Um, when you do help someone, it's very strange. Like me and my friend Todd were driving, we were in North Carolina and we were driving down the road and we saw this car. It had like, um, it's ha hazards on, but they were like really, really damn. And I was on the side of the road. And, uh, as we pass the car, maybe a couple hundred yards later, we saw a guy lying on his back and we were like, oh shit, something happened. So we stopped the car, we got out, we helped.

Speaker 1:          00:41:08       The guy would called nine one one. We got the guy up, he had severe asthma, his car ran out of gas and he, he had an asthmatic attack and fell and, and we spent a bunch of time with this guy and the cops. And, and after it was over, we have this like feeling the guy was safe. The guy was, you know, the guide him in the hospital, in an ambulance. They took him to the hospital. They did, the whole thing was resolved. And we had this like elation, this like light feeling happiness that we did something. Yeah, we were tired and we just flown in and we would rather just go to our hotel, but instead we spend an hour or so and we felt way better. You know, it's like this feeling of elevation you've helped your fellow being right. So it's naturally programmed. Dennis.

Speaker 5:          00:41:52       And so therefore we can continue to cultivate that. And so it's more of a consistent state

Speaker 1:          00:41:57       that's present. That's what I've learned. Yeah. That's where the cynic would say that the whole reason for that is so that these humans can breed and make more humans to figure, figured out a made way to make a better electric car who figured out a way to make like a wormhole.

Speaker 5:          00:42:12       It also reminds me of science in the mirror neurons to, cause we're learning that, you know, we're mirroring each other and what you're doing is effecting me and what I'm doing is affecting you and it's rewiring our brains as we're talking. So, yeah. So I mean, in that sense like we really are so connected that we don't even realize how connected we are. So in a sense, yeah, it is one of the most important things

Speaker 1:          00:42:33       you did connect. Connection is undeniable. And it's, uh, it's fascinating when you see people change the people that they hang around with. Yeah. And they all of a sudden improve or regress. And that's a, that's a consistent pattern with human beings. You find a really good group of friends are super healthy and like to do a lot of exciting, fun things and they're compassionate to each other and you start mimicking that behavior or at least mirroring that behavior, right? Or when you're around people that are just complete massive.

Speaker 5:          00:43:01       So we don't have to be ruled by her biological desires. So when you're saying like greed and hatred and competition and all that, then I mean maybe that is where we are at a certain point in some of us are and with evolutionary drive to continue to create an open and really deepen into what some of the wisdom traditions have been talking about, then you know, it's possible to like, I dunno, evolve ourselves as we're, as we're even talking here.

Speaker 1:          00:43:27       Yeah. But Mike, my question remains like when you remove all of these biological urges, what is the purpose of this thing? Because it doesn't, this doesn't seem to me that there would be any reason to go on if you removed everything biologic.

Speaker 5:          00:43:42       That's just, yeah, that's just something, I mean, you can think like that,

Speaker 4:          00:43:46       but what would be the purpose we do? I think it's hard to know. I mean this is my point of view is like, it's hard to know because we don't know what it would be like, right. To be that, to be whatever that is. Yeah. Mine's go and try to construct it all. So it's sort of like, if we can only imagine what it would be like not to be like we are, but it's hard to imagine what it would be like to be something that has yet not yet emerged. So maybe maybe we could have a followup interview and we've all attained superintelligence and we can be no need for podcasts. Well we can, we can get together in the, uh, the instantaneous MindMeld which is, you know, intelligence and riff on that. That

Speaker 1:          00:44:23       to me seems more likely than any of those other scenarios. I, I, I wonder like what the next step is. I've stopped many times and I've spent like entire days thinking about a thousand years from today to a thousand years from now. Like, what is, what is the difference and what, what is the difference going to be and how radical is it going to be? How radical was the shift? And I really have a feeling that it's going to have nothing to do with the body and all to do with the mind. And I think that this idea of transcending the, the human body, and I have a feeling they're going to figure out some way that the human mind can access other states, dimensions, levels of consciousness that literally the human body will be irrelevant.

Speaker 4:          00:45:10       Well, it already can. Oh yeah. We, we already can access all kinds of crazy stuff for some of the trainings that I've learned in meditation or psychedelics opened that up. Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:45:20       yeah, exactly right. But what's going on there? What is that? Do we know? What is that? Is that, are you opening up the flood gates for human neuro transmitters and the body's ability to process them get skewed and you, it presents you with all sorts of, you know, delusional beliefs and crazy visions because your, your visual cortex can't process all these chemicals correctly. So you have this wild, fantastic ride, gives you the sense of euphoria and this elated sense of being disillusioned with it. Huh? No, not at all. No. Just completely offering the devil's advocate.

Speaker 4:          00:45:54       Yeah, yeah. No, I, I appreciate that. I mean I think that point of view is coming at it from the biological physical perspective, but then there's all said that perspective of consciousness itself, you know, of the experiential aspect of it, which is I think also a part of the challenge of our moment in time I think is, is starting to recognize that both of these perspectives are valid, that the, the perspective of consciousness of experience is also valid. So from the perspective of consciousness, you know, it, those altered states of experience reveal something valid. Now whether or not, you know, we can from that point of view, describe the biology of it. I think it's clear we can't, and so it's useful to have a description of like this is what's happening in the brain, these areas or d, Afrin shading and then these areas are lighting up and all of that stuff.

Speaker 4:          00:46:45       But that's not who we, that's not all of who we are. We're not just brains because you know, we're having thoughts about brains and the only way brains exists is through our, through our internal representations of brains and in, in terms of human consciousness. So I think, you know, that'd be the other perspective is like consciousness itself is also a valid perspective on this. And from that point of view, you know, those moments of altered experience of like compassion, like you described when you realized you helped the person in Asheville, um, and were there for him or you know, when your child's born or when you take a hallucinogenic a medicine with the intention of learning more about your old, you know, your, your deepest nature or something about yourself or going on a meditation retreat and exploring your experience moment by moment. I think those things reveal very important truths that are at the level of consciousness itself that, you know, you can't convince a skeptic or cynic that they're true, but you can give them the instructions and say, hey, run this program and see what happens.

Speaker 4:          00:47:52       Um, and, and, and if you do it with a certain kind of intention, then you know, it, it changes your life. It changes your perspective, it changes your sense of who you are, you know, and what this is all about. And I appreciate that you're pointing out, you know, the, the one side of it, which is that, you know, yeah, this is a, this is a limited trip. Like we don't, we don't really know what the hell is happening here. We don't know how he got into this body. At least I don't remember how I got into this body. I don't know why it's happening. Right. Um, and then like, we're gonna die, you know, at some point, and we don't know when. That's the other thing. We know we're going to die, but we don't know when. We don't know how, um, we don't know how long for now.

Speaker 4:          00:48:32       And so there is a certain, certain kind of like in your face shock about that, that I think we're constantly coping with as human beings. You know, we're crying constantly and compassion can be a way to cope with that. You know and love, like there's a term that the, this Tibetan master used who came to the America and the 70s named chuck him trunk, but, and he said there's compassion and then there's idiot compassion and idiot compassion is when you are trying to respond to suffering because you can't handle it because you don't, you can't actually deal with it. So you try to like make it go away or you try to Oh poor you, poor you, you know, that kind of compassion. So compassion can just as easily be a way to cope with the shocking reality that we don't know what's even going to happen next, let alone like what's going to happen in 5,200 years from now. Um, does that make sense?

Speaker 1:          00:49:26       Sort of. I always felt like compassion was just the way that we kept together the, we kept our love for each other and bonds and that feeling other people's pain is a way to ensure that we minimize that as much as possible. And that it's just sort of a part of the biological process, especially the biological process of transcending the simple monkey mind. And moving into some new state, the the ability to understand each other, communicate, express information and, and, and, and also to be able to conceptualize very bizarre ideas that human beings have kind of based their entire society on. We based our society on bizarre things like laws, regulations, money, the bandwidth, you know, there's a weird concepts that we have had to factor in to our view of the world, the environment, our, our, our interaction with that environment or effect on that environment.

Speaker 1:          00:50:25       How much can we mitigate that? How much is just a necessary evil to maintain our, our wonderful existence with air conditioning and you know, high speed Internet. I mean, what, what are those thoughts were, where are those things going and how much of those are connected to, again, the same thing. This constant need to stay together, help each other innovate, how each other move forward, press forward and continue to grow. And is something like Buddhism or transcendental meditation or anything, are these just sort of like ways to get through this and in a, in a relatively sane way, are these essentially man created technologies, human created technologies to mitigate the natural world?

Speaker 4:          00:51:11       I mean, in a way they clearly are. I mean, cause humans, yeah. I'm sat under trees, you know, in India 2,500 years ago of thousands of years ago and explored their own minds and did come up with various, you know, programs for how to, how to work with experience. Isn't that fascinating that someone a long time ago was like looking around people hacking each other to death with swords and he was like, you know, there's gotta be a way around some of this shit, you know, like what is, what's going on here? Why is everybody, why is every launch in arrows over the top of those walls? Like what the fuck are we doing and why in India, what the hell is going on in India? Yeah. Know, India's been the birthplace of alive developments in consciousness and not coincidentally

Speaker 1:          00:51:56       worships cows who not coincidentally make cow shit from double Angela at animals that siliciden mushrooms grow on and completely connected for sure. Without a doubt. And Soma, you know, the, the ancient vedic traditions and all these ancient Hindu texts that speak of these psychedelic drugs, we don't even know what the hell they were. These important psychedelic aspects of their culture that are completely lost. Like no one knows what Soma is. It means it's a huge part of their ancient religious tradition and you know, whatever it is is like completely up for debate. Some feel it's a common story drug with, you know, the Amanita miscarry and silicide bin and all sorts of different things, but no one knows just all guesswork, but that's gotta be a part of it. Right. Someone ate some mushrooms and said, those cows are awesome. We need to keep those guys around. Don't eat the cows. Eat this. Oh yeah, I don't need the cows like this came from the cows. Yes. You know, like what a trip. I'm just starving people letting cows go because the cows make shit that

Speaker 4:          00:53:04       from scrolling. Yeah man. I think it's crazy too that people figured out how to pay attention and use their body in a way to produce some of those effects and dodgy honestly know to be able to experience that even without mushrooms, you know, to be able to get into this kind of states of consciousness and even to stabilize them, you know, as a, as a kind of of existence. Well

Speaker 1:          00:53:26       Delaney masters people that are really good at, and Delaney, I have a friend who teaches it and he says that he can reach these complete psychedelic states where he's interacting with beings that may or may not be there that he can visually recognize in front of him. Like he can see it as if he's tripping. And I'm like, well, how do you, how are you getting there? It's just years and years and years of mindfulness in this very specific

Speaker 4:          00:53:51       right concentration, you know, is the always tied to and every contemplative tradition, these sort of psychedelic or psychic experiences, it's like the ability to focus and to, to be able to absorb consciousness in one thing seems to be the gateway and to which, you know, all of those other weird, yeah, experiences can arise, but you're told to not pay attention. Those experiences that that's like you're missing the point if you're trying to seek out these hallucinations, Simpson traditions. A lot of Buddhist traditions do sort of suggest dunk, not getting sidetracked by them, but they inform us and change the way that we can relate to things that they are important and goal, that they can definitely do a lot of good work, you know, and, and a lot of weird shit. Oh yeah. I mean sorcery like in Tibet, you know? Yeah. There's like all these people like out there like casting weird stuff at each other.

Speaker 4:          00:54:46       And you know, I don't, I haven't been to Tibet, so I don't know how much of it is like you can just see weird stuff happening and how much of it is their mythology, but all the same, like there's enough weird stories coming out of places of people that have been sitting in caves for millennia exploring their own consciousness. So we're already uploading. I mean, we've been, I guess, uploading, at least on some level. Well, the artwork itself as representative of these experiences, if you look at to baton artwork, it's so trippy. It's mindblowing. So psychedelic. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. We did it. A meditation a couple of weekends ago, and one of the guided meditations was to imagine a lotus flower in your heart that had a thousand petals and each petal with shooting off a beam of clear light that connected with another pedal and another being's heart.

Speaker 4:          00:55:34       And that sort of spread it out infinitely. But it also went in both directions, like in terms of the atomic and quantum level and the universes within Adams. And it went outward in all directions. And I'm like, wow, okay these these dudes were, you know, cause they mostly were dudes that were able to do this. These dudes were like exploring the furthest reaches of, of the inner, you know, Cosmos. What do you mean by there were mostly dudes that were able to do this? Well, I mean the cultures of Tibet and most of these places, you know there were nuns and there were women doing the practices, but I don't think they had as much opportunity to do them because of the, you know, the Organization of their cultures. But there's not a biological limitations and achieving these experiences. No. Actually the Tibetans say women have an easier time at, at these practices for seven. Imagine that

Speaker 1:          00:56:24       because testosterone is so controlling and limiting in that sense. Like there's so much ego bound to testosterone and also the, the mortality of testosterone, like being the one that survives and all that, it is inexorably sort of connected to the, the, the sex hormone over the mail. I would imagine that that would be more limiting. Emily has a better meditator than I am. I practice twice as hard and experience half the results. Do you guys ever go in a sensory deprivation tanks? I have not done that. I haven't done that yet. How dare both of you, I know, I know it's such a confusing thing to me because I've been such an advocate on the sensory deprivation tank and I talked to so many people that are into meditation and like how do you not use the one tool that is essentially like designed for the best meditation possible?

Speaker 1:          00:57:12       Well retreats, you know, we, we've both done a lot of months of intensive retreat and it's kind of like sensory deprivation. I mean you don't talk, you don't, um, you know, you, you eat what's in front of you. You, you're sitting in silence most of the time. It like, it really does limit the sensory input. Um, and you know, I've been in states of consciousness where all sensory input sort of disappears for awhile. So I feel like I've had that experience of how could you say that though if you haven't done it, if you haven't done the actual tank itself? Oh, I don't know how it compares exactly, but I know what it's like to experience a lack of sensory input. Right. Until you sign a certain level and a certain level that you know, there's no sense of visual sight sound. It's actually probably deeper because there's no sense of the body at all in those states.

Speaker 1:          00:57:58       It's completely formless, um, deeper than what? Deeper than if you're laying in a tank and you still have an experience of the senses of your body. Like if you can still feel your body, can you feel your body in a sensory denomination? No, that's the whole point. Okay, so it's probably similar. More intense. This is why I've done both. And the sensory deprivation tank, you're weightless, we'll have to do it. You're floating in water. That's the same, the temperatures of your skin. So you don't recognize where the water ends and the, your, your body completely ceases to send information to you. Yeah. And if you guys are already good at meditating, meditating in a tank would be like turbo charged probably, right? 100% guaranteed. I can't believe you haven't done it, but why don't you have a sponsor yet for for uh, I sent in my basement.

Speaker 1:          00:58:45       I have a tank in my basement. I go in that soccer all the time. You need a new advertiser here. I think I could sort of help my frank crash who owns a, the float lab in Venice, but I don't do it for financial compensation. I just do it because I want people to know about it. But I would, I do, I retweet people's tanks all the time that I have no affiliation with whatsoever. Just cause I think it's an, it's a massively important tool that is somehow or another slipped through the fingers of, of our, our, our consciousness. I don't, I don't get how people haven't grabbed a hold of that and ran with it. I read a study one time that says a lot of people, once they have some sort of opening, we could call

Speaker 5:          00:59:22       it mystical experience, for lack of a better word right now, um, that a lot of people don't want to have him again after they've had it the first time. Something about the opening kind of freaks people out. Um, but I'm just saying, yeah, I mean that and it can be scary for people. So it seems like the expansion of consciousness is something that is naturally in us as well. And so thinking about the technology where we started this conversation a little bit, it's like there is this impulse to explore and to like expand and upload into different states and realms of being.

Speaker 1:          00:59:58       But that fear of expansion, that's just, that's just the ego, that's all that is. That's just your body trying to reclaim like some sort of walls. What's, let's put boundaries on this sucker so we can clearly defined it where you know, when you have a psychedelic experience, one of the things that's the most talked about aspect of it is the boundary dissolving aspect of it. That the boundaries all dissolve. And like I remember one of the first times that I did a, a really potent psychedelic was five Meo DMT. And the overwhelming message from it was that there's no up and there's no down and that you're just a part of the, the infinite. And that feeling is very like saying it like this is, it sounds like just a bunch of noise coming out of your mouth that sort of vaguely represents what this concept would be.

Speaker 1:          01:00:51       But experiencing it in a psychedelic state was so overwhelmingly educational. And so, um, it was so boundary defining like whatever I had thought of as a boundary in the past was now like, oh, that was just this and this is just that and what, what you really are is one thing that is holding all these other things that are all a part of this huge thing. And this huge thing is you're in it. You're not separate. I'm not separate from you. You and I are these containers that are inside of this. There's air and there's, there's always something there. There's no, there's no nothing. It doesn't exist. There's no nothing, there's no nothing anywhere. Even nothing is something.

Speaker 4:          01:01:38       Yeah, no. Shinzen young, one of our favorite teachers, he says emptiness is not a thing. It's a pure doing. Which is sort of another way of saying, I think what you're pointing to, that everything is just happening as it is. And there's no, um, in a sense there's no thing that even goes beyond all of that. It's just this, you know, it's just this happening that's happening.

Speaker 1:          01:02:00       Universe also is like a soup. It's not like a, you're not throwing a ball through the air and someone's catching it. It's not hitting anything. It's not a vacuum. Like the whole thing is just, it's filled with something. It's all connected. Like you, you and I aren't really separate from each other. We're just not touching skin, but we're touching something that's touching us. It's in that, you know, we're all feeling that, boy, that sounds hippy. Ooh, that's Hippie Shit. But it's, but it's also true. Yeah. In some way it's also true. And that these, these ideas, whether it's meditation or yoga or psychedelics or these ideas of mindfulness are in a lot of ways an attempt to escape this monkey realm, to escape this biological realm that we find ourselves in, to try to, if not escape it, rather, um, to manage it. Transform it. Yes. I would say transform it to what though?

Speaker 5:          01:03:02       I don't have a good answer to what kind of looping back around where we started this conversation to what

Speaker 4:          01:03:07       right. Isn't that like building a house and you don't have plans? Like what are you doing? I'm just putting shingles on this thing and it's going to hopefully be something I think, I think, uh, having, I mean, I think there, there we each have to answer that question too. What I mean, and that's a very personal thing. And that way you think, I mean, I think it's personal in one way, but it's also collective in another way. Um, because we, you know, we, we influence each other and we get attracted to things that are connected with what's important to us. Um, but you know, to me, to what, you know, I think what's beautiful is, you know, to, to move toward deep percents of wisdom to, to move toward being able to live in harmony with that realization of interconnectivity of deep, of that after kind of profound interconnectivity that you're describing, you know, that literally that at some level isn't a separation between us.

Speaker 4:          01:03:58       You know, w how does that then inform how I live? How does that change how I live? Do I sort of say, oh, well what's the fucking point and just give up or do I, you know, take that experience and begin to dismantle habits and, and ideas and beliefs that are opposed to that experience and actually begin to live more in harmony to, you know, in the kind of language of contemplative training to embody that realization, to make it your own, um, you know, end to end to make your life and expression of that an expression of that interconnectivity and compassionate and, um, deep care and love for each other and including, you know, cutting through all the bullshit and including calling out the delusion, you know, including, you know, pimp smacking the bullshit, which is I think a big part of, you know, what I see you doing here

Speaker 5:          01:04:49       and have it just say, leaving room for the what to change. You know, that's not like a fixed thing that we're going to transform into this fixed thing. We're going to continue to, to change and to evolve. And so that's beautiful to me,

Speaker 1:          01:05:01       Jen. Certainly beautiful from a biological standpoint. I mean I'm, I'm not a cynic in that I don't love life and I don't love humans cause I, I, I, I enjoy this experience incredibly. I thought, I think it's an amazing time. I think being a person is great. I love it. I love people. I love all fun things you could do as a person. But what I'm trying to get to, when we were talking, transhumanism and this, I'm escaping the boundaries of biology. There's a guy that we talked about in this podcast before they got bitten by a shark. So Australian cat, he lost his arm and his leg and they replaced it with this carbon fiber creation and he's moving around. He's standing there, no limp guy walks around normal has his hand that, you know, it's kind of crude, but it does move and it can pick things up.

Speaker 1:          01:05:47       And I'm like, wow, this is quite fascinating. Like they said to this guy, hey, I know you got your arm and leg put off by shark, but lucky for you, this is 2014 and we have some incredible innovation that we've created that's going to allow you to have this leg that moves very much like a regular leg and you're going to have a hand that can do a lot of things that a regular hand can do. So that's better than not having that arm and leg and yes, and guess what? It's going to get better. Five years from now. We'll have a better arm and a better leg and you're going to enjoy this. Well, if as time goes on, the other parts of his body start failing like a, you know what man? There's problem because you have this artificial right leg. Your left knee is gone.

Speaker 1:          01:06:29       So we're going to replace your left leg too with this artificial leg. So this way you'll have two artificial legs and they're, but they're going to work great. Okay, great. Okay, listen man, your heart is going. Uh, but good news. We have an artificial heart and we're going to take this artificial and a hundred years from now, this guy is just a brain in this carbon fiber body. And he's looking at his eyes. He's looking through these artificially created eyes and they say, listen, everything works great except the cells of your brain are reproducing irregularly and you're going to develop Parkinson's. But we have figured out a way to download your consciousness into an artificial brain. So we'll just download your consciousness into this art in the well what's left of you? You don't, there's nothing. There's no biology anymore and well what's there then when you sit there like they turn that switch on and your, you know, 2.0 what, what goes on there?

Speaker 4:          01:07:27       Well, from a, from a Buddhist perspective, what's there is your, is your Karma. What's there is the pattern that was you leading up to that point. You know, the information that made you up and that has continued to move into this new sub straight. Um, and that pattern has a momentum to it. It has, uh, a history. It has memories, has beliefs. It has, you know, it has various things. It doesn't, it's not a complete discontinuity. Um, the substrates changed. But the, uh, you know, the pattern has continued in some sense, right?

Speaker 1:          01:08:02       Maybe, but how much of that pattern is based on biological need? How much of that pattern is based on this cultural conditioning and the, the, just the patterns of behavior that you've adopted along the way

Speaker 6:          01:08:16       and your life and the, the environment in which you grew up in. How much of that goes away when you have a brain that's made out of fibers that are constructed out of silicon and, or whatever?

Speaker 5:          01:08:29       Depends on how it's constructed. This reminds me of them. I don't know if you've had the experience in some of my teachers talk about this as an example. A lot is, um, you know, looking in the mirror now and you, you kind of get surprised that, that you've aged, but there's something in you that you don't feel as aged. Do you ever have that experience? I do. In what way? It's just like, you know, you just, there's part of you that has an age and then at the same time, if you look in the mirror, you can tell that you've aged. Does that make sense? There's a piece of us, right? That's like, I don't know, I still feel like nothing's changed inside, inside your vehicle, but my feet, but then I look in the mirror and I'm like, oh my gosh. Yeah. Like I gotta, I gotta have my time is taken even though I'm young, you know? But I, I get that. So there's this like paradox kind of at play. So when we're talking about like what if we do upload or what is it that is still there? Like I wonder if some of that will still be there, that feeling of nothing's changed. And then there is this change that happens when we age and

Speaker 6:          01:09:32       well, if we'd stop aging, I mean if the, if it completely ends or if it's a temporary aging, we just got to go and get repainted, you know? I mean, if your car gets a Patina from, you know, rocks and chips on the road and stop, all you have to do is bring to the body shop and the old cars that look awesome. You know, we can't do that with a human being. But if we can, if there's, you know, there's companies that specialize in replacing every single part of an old car and creating you a new version of an old car that that is ultimately incredibly possible for a human being. I think that's possible. That's crazy though.

Speaker 5:          01:10:12       You know, and there is this part of us that wants to live forever. I mean, the holy grail, like some of these myths that existed for a long time. So

Speaker 6:          01:10:21       everybody wants to sleep, but nobody wants to die. Yeah. It's quite fascinating. Everybody's more than happy to shut off for eight hours. Like, Oh yeah, here we go. Nothing

Speaker 4:          01:10:33       I find bizarre. It's like, I find it bizarre now is, I mean a lot of the fear of death seems to be connected to a fear of the unknown of what would happen after death. Like, am I just going to disappear? You know, what's going to happen? Um, and not knowing that is part of, I think of the terror, the feeling of not knowing what's going to happen. And what I find interesting is, you know, and we were just talking to her, one of our zen teachers who, who teach us here in Santa Monica, she pointed out, you know, in every moment we actually don't know what's coming next. You know, that not knowing it, it's something we're constantly having to deal with. The terror of not knowing, uh, or you know, as her zen teacher called it the don't know mind, you know? And so I find it interesting to kind of reflect on what it's like to rest in the not knowing to rest in that, that sense of not knowing what's gonna come next.

Speaker 4:          01:11:31       Because in that moment, every next moment is both a death of this moment and the rebirth of something new. There's something new coming online and there's something disappearing. And in that sense, I think if we become comfortable and familiar with that process of moment by moment, birth and death, then you know, whatever happens, whether my consciousness gets uploaded to the cloud or I die, there's some sense of there's some part of me which is fundamentally okay with that death process, that the constant dying. And that was the thing I always thought was funky about the attempt to escape death. Because actually in order to escape death, we're going to have to go through so many deaths of who we think we are. You know, like you're saying, you know, to, to, to transplant your consciousness into a silicon brain like some part of you dies in that. And so we're trying to escape death by running into it headlong.

Speaker 6:          01:12:24       Well also what if death is merely a transitionary phase? What if you are, you live in this existence, but when you die you will enter into a new existence. And this is what many ancient religions have speculated on throughout the beginning of time. I mean, since the beginning of time, everyone thinks that there's some sort of, I mean, whether it's wishful thinking or whatever it is, it might be real. Just like consciousness is a very bizarre thing to try to define, but it is certainly a real thing. You know, if you tried to put consciousness in a lab and say like, what is it? What is it that causes creativity? What is it that would define love in some sort of a chemical process? No. Well, good luck with that. You know? Good luck with trying to figure out why. What that, what that warm feeling is when you see your friend at the airport,

Speaker 4:          01:13:11       no time magazine cover that says that you couldn't, they couldn't find the God particle. Do you remember that? Yeah. In the brain they can't find it. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          01:13:20       Well, what is it? You know, what, what, what is, there's so many different aspects to what is life? What, what defines this existence for the person who experiences at themselves and does that transition to something else at the moment of death? And is that why the brain, it produces all these indigenous psychedelic chemicals that give you when you take them, give you this elated sense of being, give you this, this sense of relieving of anxiety and this sense of connection to everything and everything. Every one that exists, like what? Why do those exist? Like why are those chemicals in the mind and why are those chemicals, why they released at the moment of death, why they release it? The moment of extreme stress when your body's worried it's going to die. Why those released during the dream state? Like what? What is that and would we be trapping whatever consciousness we have now in this artificial creation.

Speaker 6:          01:14:15       If you can download consciousness into some artificial creation, is that a hellish existence for that consciousness because it's no longer able to transition to the next phase of being and would you be able to transition to that next phase phase of being as a biological entity and then realize like, oh my God, what did I do with my consciousness? I left it back there in that fucking robot and who and who would be conscious of that? If there was no conscious. Yeah. Well what is it? What you know, what is that thing? What is the life, what is the life that gets that transitions. The life expires, the, the light goes out and you pass over. But yet this robot wakes up and it's you and it has no lifespan. You know, it has no whatever it, no sexual urges. No need for community is just this thing that has all of your memories.

Speaker 6:          01:15:07       Yeah. I hope you don't design the future Ai. Well we have real problems. If we design it to mimic and replicate biological life, we have real problems there. We'd have real problems if we didn't too. That's true as well. Will the biological us would. Yeah. Cause we would, you know, that's where the terminator comes to. It has no need for us. What's it's why everything that we are as far as what the way our society is structured as far as the, our senses of fairness and love and compassion. They're all based on biological urges and needs. The need for community is a strong urge to keep us all together. So we stay alive longer. I mean, all of these things are, they're a part of being a biological entity. And when we no longer are, why would we engineer all of those biological urges and thoughts and concepts into this carbon fiber creation?

Speaker 6:          01:16:05       I've heard the argument, and I think this is interesting too though, that you know, the need for community goes back to the very earliest moments of the universe. You know, that in some sense, you know, when Adams, uh, when Adam has emerged, they emerged in collectives, you know, that they didn't just emerge as a single atom, that they're always wins when a single thing emerges. It emerges also with a collective, you know, in that sense, you know, the, the sense of community is hardwired maybe into the universe itself, but isn't also the sense of competition then because all biological life is this wild race of things, eating things, letting vegetarians, I mean, the whole idea is as things grow and these other things come along and eat them as they grow and there's no way around it, life eats life, you know, and you can try to keep your biological footprint as small as possible.

Speaker 6:          01:16:58       And do as little harm as possible, but every step you take is killing life. Every time you close your mouth, you're killing bacteria. I mean, you're, you're doing, when you wash yourself, you're killing living things is a lot of weirdness to this, this whole life that is tied to survival, tied to birth death and the prolonging of the species or the improvement of the species as it tries to prolong. Absolutely. I mean, it's a paradox to, yeah, but that's isn't that part of what's cool about being alive is that it's not gonna last. I mean that's, that's the one of the big issues with the transhumanist movement, this idea of transcending the biological limitations and living forever, but, but then it sucks. It's like a movie that's a hundred hours long. You know, I don't want to see star wars for a hundred hours. I want to see star wars for two hours because at the end of two hours, it's awesome. Like that was a great movie. Yay. You walk outside and you're in the sunlight. You talk about how great that moment was with your friends. Everybody's happy. But if star wars is goes on for infinity, it fucking sucks, you know, for, you know, a hundred years later it's still going warp speed and Chewbacca is like fucking get me Outta here. This is terrible. This movie sucks. You know why? Because it's boring. I don't want to see it for a hundred hours. I want to see it for two. Is that life itself,

Speaker 4:          01:18:25       I mean the, the question I would ask is, you know, is it true that there will be no limitations if we transcend our biological limitations or is it the case that there'll be new limitations that we can't fathom? You know, that become again, and this, this ties in with the question that we've asked ourselves, you know, with, with the, the Buddhist practice like is enlightenment and end state or is it an ongoing ever unfolding process? You know, and I think if it, if it is an unfolding ever evolving process, then that means there will always be, as long as there's stuff, there will always be limitations. There always be something that's not quite as perfect as it could be. Um, or that you know, is not quite it. And so in that sense, I would guess that, I mean this is my guess is not that we would transcend limitations altogether, but that will transcend certain ones and then discover new ones and then the whole process of creative tension. We'll begin again at some new, you know, level and we'll be like, oh shit. Like I, I really don't appreciate the fact that I can't have two experiences simultaneously that I've done. There's this one experience. Even if I can move between multiple realms really rapidly, I still can only have this one moment of experience, you know, then what I am. That's just a guess.

Speaker 6:          01:19:40       Maybe one of the limitations. Well that's fascinating. What do you bring that up? Because that, that does open up a different realm of possibilities. If we can transcend the limitations of biology and that includes experiencing multiple things simultaneously or the ability to experience multiple lives. Like if we figure out a way to combine our consciousness or whatever we call our consciousness, once we transcend biological life and combined our minds so that we do experience the lives of multiple people, if not the entire human race that's on the same track, experience it all simultaneously and that that this is beyond the realm of biological understanding and maybe that's where we evolve from this thing and become something that's far more complex and complicated

Speaker 1:          01:20:31       in less in less. One aspect of that decides it doesn't want to be merged into the hole and then you get warring factions or Warren fraction problems. Much larger scale warring factions of transhumanism is trying to pull each other's batteries out and trying to pull each other into each other's version of utopia. Yeah, right. Oh, that's another issue, right? Like what if there's like a Mac version and a windows version and a non compatible,

Speaker 6:          01:20:58       everyone's trying to figure out what, which one is going to be the Beta Max and which one, you know Betamax was better, but VHS survived and you've got to pick the right team. That's right. Yeah. There's different. Yeah, because it's not like there's going to be only one company that comes up with a transhumanist solution. Right,

Speaker 5:          01:21:15       right. This is reminding me of like the fluidity of it perspectives. As I've trained in practice, it's like the mind, it has the capacity to take on multiple, multiple perspectives and how important that actually is in the world today to be able to take different points of view and take multiple perspectives and and not have the right way or that way. So there's a lot of possibilities. Yeah. The

Speaker 6:          01:21:41       you said also this fascinating is this idea that we, we can't even really imagine what the potentials are because the potentials, we'll create new potentials that were before that, unrecognizable. We, we didn't, we didn't see them coming. Like if you went back in time a few hundred years ago and tried to explain to them the Internet, they'd be like, what the fuck are you talking about? If you went back before the printing press and tried to explain the internet and trying to access Google on your phone with voice commands or Siri, you know, Siri. Yeah. Try to explain that to people that live before printed type to be like, what are you even yapping about? They would never be able to wrap their head around it much like we will never be able to wrap our head around the possibilities once we transcend the biological limitations. The hive mind to me seems to be the most likely the hivemind.

Speaker 6:          01:22:37       Yeah. The idea that we're going to somehow or another experience and experience each other, uh, on some very, very broad scale, some very large scale. And I think we're kind of doing that with shit like Facebook and with Twitter and with interaction on the Internet. I think what we're doing is dipping our toe in the ocean of connectivity. Oh yeah. I like that phrase. Yeah. That's really good. Yeah. Because think that we're slowly but surely devolve or I'm dissolving or developing maybe that suit biological of all right. But dissolving these, um, limitations of communication, we're slowly but surely expressing ourselves in, in ways and interacting in ways that didn't exist before. And then when new things come along, like are you aware of Oculus rift? Yeah, sure. I've got the Dev kit two waiting for me in, in North Carolina. I can't wait. Dunkin has it.

Speaker 6:          01:23:35       My friend Duncan Trussell has it and he just got back from experiencing porn in uh, in virtual reality, first person porn and he goes, it is the craziest thing you've ever experienced in your life. Like you are this other person having sex with someone. You could look down at your body, you can look at your feet and your legs and you can experience like sexual intercourse with somebody that you don't feel it obviously, but he's like, this is going to change the entire world we live in. And the new version of it is insanely high definition. Right. And you know, he keeps saying, yeah,

Speaker 7:          01:24:08       you got to come over my house and try out the fucking new rift. Man, it's mind blowing.

Speaker 6:          01:24:13       He called me up the day he saw it and he's like, he's like, this is bigger than the Internet. He goes, this is bigger than anything that's ever been invented by people. Yeah, I've heard the same thing. And I mean, the thing I'm most excited about is creating contemplative training environments in, in, in the rift. You know, what would it be like to completely, you know, like you said, immerse yourself in a visual field, you know, with nothing outside of it and be able to, you know, in some sense, uh, experience some of the same states that psychedelics burnout bring on, but you know, directly through a technological interface. You know, I'm one of my friends called it techno deluxe. You know, that the sense that the technology could produce some of the states as well. Well, that's what Mckenna, his belief was sure about DMT is that he believed that if you could create a world that mimics exactly the psychedelic experience of dimethyl trip to mean that he believed that in that state, those same beings that you interface with when you take the psychedelic drugs would show up.

Speaker 6:          01:25:14       He had this like field of dreams type scenario. If you build it, they'll come and that that would be the best case scenario for psychedelic intervention. It wasn't getting a bunch of people to take drugs. It's like put this on virtual reality, this, yeah, that one day the state will, I mean the, the virtual reality will achieve the, the, the, the type of possibilities to achieve something like that. Yeah. And then, and then the question becomes, you know, and I think Mckenna said this, you know, what, what worlds do we build? You know, what virtual reality is, do we build and what values do we build into them and program into them? You know, cause I don't think that issue is going to go away. We still have to ask this questions and decide what we're building. Well, again, that's the big, the real mind.

Speaker 6:          01:25:59       Fuck. It's, it's not even essentially that, um, you know, like we're going to a different biological body, but we might have a different reality that is indistinguishable from this reality that we can pick up and put on a scale the, the concept of virtual existence of some sort of existence in a simulation as it were. You know, the simulation is a weird word because simulation implies that it's not real. But if it has all the consequences and all the feeling and textures and all the interactions and interfaces that you're the regular life does as far as tactile, as far as heat sensitivity, you all the different aspects of our life. But we can recreate those. Exactly. What is that? If it's not life, I don't, I'm not. If it is an experience and you're, you're taking in every single aspect of that experience exactly the same way you would take in this life, what is it? And if that's the case, how do we know we're not all the already in it? How do we know that this isn't good and indistinguishable artificial reality that we have created and we're just tapped into this sucker? I mean, that's my presumption that we're in an artificial reality.

Speaker 4:          01:27:11       I mean, I, I presume this is a virtual reality simulation. Yeah. Why is that? Because it, because stuff's happening and I don't know what's happening.

Speaker 2:          01:27:26       Okay.

Speaker 6:          01:27:26       What do you mean by that?

Speaker 4:          01:27:29       I mean, I guess we were watching Nick Bostrom last night, kind of lay out the argument for this, you know, the virtual reality simulation hypothesis. Yeah. And he was basically saying, you know, one possibility is in we, we're in a virtual reality, uh, an ancestral simulation. And then the other possibility is that no technology note know civilizations get to the point technologically where they can produce this kind of technology. They all vanish. That's one possibility. Um, and then the third possibility was, I'll see if I can remember it. I don't understand that possibility. So, so basically saying this is a real universe, because know civilizations get so, so there could be no civilization, which gets to the point where it develops that capacity, that virtual reality technology.

Speaker 6:          01:28:14       But what, how was that even an option? No civilization does it make he could say no civilization has,

Speaker 4:          01:28:21       oh yeah, no civilization has, you know, so that there are so, because he's assuming that if, if someone does do it, this is getting kind of analytically geeky. But, um, so it was this whole damn show, right? Yeah, that's true. But he, I think he's saying like, if, if, if, if a hyper intelligent species can create a virtual reality, they will, you know, and they'll create many of them. Right. And so it's Probabil probability wise, it's much more likely that we're in a simulation because of how many that could be created. You know, you get some light emit an infinite number of universes through a, like a hyper in a next generation computer. So that was his argument for why we're probably in a simulation.

Speaker 6:          01:28:57       Never say probably, uh, I, I would agree in the sense that it's, it's quite possible that if it is possible to one day achieve this sort of technological ability to create something that's indistinguishable from this reality. If it is possible, and I assume that it's going to be possible if you hear about things like this new oculus rift and compare it to the quill, they used to have to dip into ink to write things down. That was the only way to distribute information. Yeah, it's possible that one day we're going to achieve that. But the other thing that you have to take into consideration is it's almost universally accepted that at least if this world is real and if this life that we are living is not a simulation, it's universally accepted that this is the pinnacle of human innovation. That we are at the cusp where at the apex right now and that we are at the very, like there's more information today.

Speaker 6:          01:29:52       We have more knowledge. We have more of an understanding of our universe than any human beings before us ever have ever. So if that's the case, why wouldn't we assume that we just haven't reached it yet? That seems to be far more likely than the possibility that no civilization ever achieves it. That's why it's not there yet. Well then we just haven't reached it yet. Yeah, it seems way more likely. I don't understand why anybody would reach, uh, a contrary conclusion if all the evidence, whether it's cultural like watching old television shows and comparing them to the sophistication of today's, whether it's musical comparing old, uh, you know, old like Beethoven music and old music from the 50s, like buddy Holly type shit. And comparing it to what people are doing today, whether it's technological, which is super easy and clear to, to grasp and understand.

Speaker 6:          01:30:44       It's no, there's no doubt whatsoever that were at the apex that as far as what we can observe, that things are, we have more ability, were more competent, we're more, we're more able to alter our environment, communicate, et cetera. Our technology is far more far more complex than ever has been at any other time in human history that's been recorded that we're, that we can access. So if that's the case, why won't we just assume that we're on this path to that? Why would we assume that no civilization has ever achieved it or can ever achieve it? That doesn't mean,

Speaker 4:          01:31:19       I don't assume that myself, but I think I won. One thing I'd throw in the ring is, you know, that way of looking at our history is sort of like a linear model, right? Like right. We've kind of, we've got the story about, you know, the universe started this many billion years ago with the Big Bang and then it sort of coalesced into whatever it coalesced into. And eventually, you know, life emerged a billion years ago and evolve to be what it is now. And we're at this sort of where at the sort of linear progression of Ellucian unfolding, but that story's only like 200 years old. So why would we assume that that story is accurate? Um, or that, that way of looking at it's accurate? I mean, it seems more likely in a hundred years we'll have a completely, completely different conception of what the universe is. And, and I wonder if part of that conception of, part of what we'll break down, and I'll tie this back into the contemplative tradition because this is, it's something that breaks down in contemplative practice, is the sense that time is, uh, exists in the way we think it exists.

Speaker 4:          01:32:18       It exists in a linear kind of motion, um, time, you know, for the, for the zen in the Zen tradition with Dogan, his whole a chronic, like the holographic universe, you know, there's, all these things are contained within themselves in this sort of a lot of these Buddhist descriptions of consciousness, you know, all, all times exist simultaneously and can be accessed simultaneously. You know, it can be accessed here or there. And so in that sense, you know, the, uh, as the, as the traditional tech say, the Buddhas of past, present and future all exist right now, including ourselves. And I don't know, that would be a very different way of experiencing time. I experienced it, you know, maybe like on occasions experience it that way. But for the most part, that is not the way I, I tend to think this is a linear thing that's like, this got to start and we'll have an end.

Speaker 6:          01:33:06       Well, the number one mind fuck of all times infinity and being, being that not only is it like, I think especially when your children, you know, like you know the kids will say something like, you know I, when times infinity, you know what, what infinity the, the, the, the big mind fuck of infinity is that not only is the concept of infinity impossible to grasp, but the parameters of that concept are so strange that if infinity is real and if the universe is infinite, the way it's been described to me is that everything that has ever happened on this earth, in the exact order has happened on other earths, an infinite number of times, including every single timeline. So right now the 1950s or going on an infinite number of times in the exact same order, the 1950s went on in America, the 1950s on earth, the 1950s are going on in the infinite number of times in the universe as are the 1960s as our 1961 December 21st as our December 22nd all those days are happening in the exact same order with the exact same events, exact same wards and every possible variation in between.

Speaker 6:          01:34:25       So different words, different events, different forms of expression. Different languages arise, different conquers when those things are all happening simultaneously throughout the universe. So everything is happening all at once. So if infinity is correct, like what their concept of time being constant and happening all at once, it is, it's, it is happening all at once is just the container that holds it in his infinite. It's, it is a physical manifestation of this concept and an okay question to riff off that that I'd ask is, and is consciousness something that's happening to this biological being in this one variation of the universe or is consciousness something that moves through this infinite potentiality and experiences it? That's the mind fuck. If you wake up and you're in this other you somewhere else in the multiverse and you know your decisions and choices allow you to travel from one potential to the next, but wherever you left off where you've ever made, maybe you were a smoker or a drinker in the past, or you had some sort of bad habits and you escape those bad habits, but not every timeline and then at some timeline, this timeline, well, maybe not yet.

Speaker 6:          01:35:52       You will after this conversation. You know what I mean? I mean like the idea of being that we're, we believe that we're limited to this, this very same physical space in the universe because this is where we are every day. But what if we transfer our consciousness from this one to the next one and they're indistinguishable from each other physically to us, but not their potential is very different. And that in a sense, you are dimension traveling. And that's why we sleep.

Speaker 6:          01:36:28       That's why people say sleep on it, sleep on your problems, man. Then maybe it'll go away in the morning and you're just going to transfer to another stage of you somewhere else in the universe. Or maybe this is more hippy bullshit. Heinous. Hate it. When I accused myself, rightly so of hippy bullshit. But if, if an infinity is correct and um, not only do they believe that the universe is infinite, but they believe there are infinite number of universes, which is the ultimate ultimate mind fuck. The fractal nature of reality itself. Being that every single galaxy, which contains hundreds of billions of stars, has a supermassive black hole in the center of it, which is exactly one half of 1% of the mass of the entire galaxy. And if you pass through that, you will enter into another universe of hundreds of billions of galaxies, each with a black hole and the center that has a portal to another universe.

Speaker 6:          01:37:25       And then the whole thing just keeps going on. So they're all the whole, every universe is infinite. And inside every universe is an infinite number of universes. And that's how big it is. That's why every timeline that has ever existed, every possibility is all happening simultaneously, all throughout the whole thing. That's what those Tibetans thought. Well, they sat in a cave and just explored their own minds. They were tripping balls. They're probably taking something they weren't centration were tripping on in Dutch in history. Yeah. That's the thing. The indogenous drugs, like you're tripping. Even if you're not tripping like you, you have to, everybody does. There's no way around it. You're tripping when you're sleeping. I had some trippy dreams last night. Totally. Yeah. Those are trips. Absolutely. That was the trip. This is a trip. Yes, definitely tripping right now. I think a lot of people listen to their trip until this people right now on a subway going, whoa, whoa, that everything is happening everywhere.

Speaker 6:          01:38:23       All the time. Like the concept of infinity, like no, no, no. This is the, this is a unique moment that's unique. Not, not, not really. Got The concept of infinity then everything's happening right now. Yes. Well for you, everything is happening right now, but the concept of infinity is undeniable mathematically. That's the problem is that like you can't just ignore the, like all you have to do is go outside and look up. You go outside and look up at night and you see stars realize those are just an impossible distance and those are the neighbors. Those are the ones that are really close and if you stood on one of those stars and looked out into the distance, he would see stars that were equally far away that seem equally ridiculous to try to reach. And if you got to those, there's no end. You just see you're going to keep going and going and going. So all the evidence of infinity, at least of the concept of great, great distance being outside of the realm of understanding is all it's right in front of us every night

Speaker 4:          01:39:26       and a moment. Yeah. At the, at the same time, I think there's a way of experiencing infinity that isn't about distance. It's about consciousness and infinity being, you know, this conscious experience that we're having right now, right. The room that we're seeing, the sounds that we're hearing, the body sensations that we're having, all of these are also arising in our experience, right in our awareness. And the idea of infinite distance is a thought that arises in my awareness. And so in some sense there's only this awareness, there's only this experience that we've ever had. And so in that sense, you know, um, the idea, the concept of infinity as a distance, as a great distance drops away. And there's just this, there's just this one moment that's happening. I think that's what you pointing to and there's an infinite quality to it in terms of that, that the consciousness itself is infinitely present. It's infinitely here. I don't know how to describe it actually, that the consciousness is infinitely present throughout the whole thing. It it's undeniably the fact that we are conscious, you know, just like you said that the infinity is undeniable. Consciousness is undeniable. You know this is happening.

Speaker 6:          01:40:47       You cannot deny this as how, because there's levels of consciousness, right? There's people that are conscious that are just, they're, there's wandering through this live drinking and walking into walls like are they conscious as well and isn't that consciousness like a very limited consciousness and as consciousness expands, what's the, with the ongoing theme when we're talking about meditation and Meditative practices in the lightened meant, yeah, achieving the psychedelic states through consciousness adjustment or consciousness manipulation. Like there's levels and layers to the whole thing, right?

Speaker 4:          01:41:24       Yeah. There, there are levels and layers and there is this unified field of consciousness which does mount no matter what is arising in it and how simple or complex it is. It's just what it is.

Speaker 6:          01:41:39       That's why it's really strange to me that the concept of simple biology as opposed like complex biological life that understand itself. Yeah. It's simple biology of individual cells or ma, then multicell organisms and then the concept of of being that's aware of itself and can communicate over vast distances like human beings extrapolate that a thousand years plus whatever it is from now. Do we have the ability to do the same thing with consciousness throughout the entire universe itself? Like is our ability to communicate over vast distances and to communicate with each other? Is this just a beginning stage and is never ending process of dissolving boundaries where the actual boundaries of space itself? Yeah, no longer exist and we can interface with intelligent life that has figured out the same sort of shit. Yeah. Everywhere else in the world. The the the like universe wide web or something.

Speaker 6:          01:42:41       Yeah, exactly. Yeah. Yeah. I mean if, if the universe is infinite and the most scientists agree it is or they believe it is many do. I mean it's, it's one of those things where you have the observable universe, right? Which is like 14 billion light years or something like that. But, and then like we were talking about with the big bang, like it all came out of what like Mckenna had the, the, the best take on the big bang. He's like, science is essentially saying, allow us this one miracle and we'll explain everything. And that's really what it is. They, the whole universe came from something smaller than the head of a pin. How, um, let me get back to you on that. But it did. And because of that, all this stuff's here. Well, is that a miracle? Uh, I wouldn't know. Use that word.

Speaker 6:          01:43:29       You know, like, yes. Yes it is. That's a fucking miracle, man. If a guy can come back from the dead after three days, that ain't shit. The universe came out of a head of a pin. You don't think that's more impressive than a dude coming back from the dead. The guy coming back from dead. Clearly a miracle. Can we agree on that? Walking on water, clearly a miracle, right? Water into wine. The motherfucker made a miracle. Right? The universe itself is a miracle. All of our stories about it or miracles. Yes. And whether or not those are just fables. The same way the ancient Hawaiians, the Polynesians talked about the gods stitching the stars together with thread. You know, maybe that's what our concept of the big bang, it's just our antiquated notion or are rather primitive notion of something that's really beyond our capacity to understand.

Speaker 6:          01:44:20       Yeah. That's the, that's what the mind fuck to me. Yeah. It's our myth. It's our, our isis. That's our Zeus. That's our, you know, that's our Odin is like the big bang. Yeah. It's just in one day they'll laugh at us. These fucking dummies thought that the universe was smaller than the head of a pin and that what if for whatever reason, man, it just blew up and became the universe. Yeah. One day soon probably. Yeah, maybe. Right. Maybe, or at least in terms of reference, it'll, it'll be similar to Galileo to us. Yeah, yeah. You know, Galileo thinking that the universe was not centered around the earth and everybody going, what are you fucking crazy. Absolutely. Like a big form point of contention and now it's universally agreed that Galileo was correct and everybody else's being silly. I there may very well come a day when someone proposes something far more radical than the big bang, the proves to be true.

Speaker 6:          01:45:21       And everybody, you know, everybody else is like, wait, wait, what are you saying? Hold on, hold on, hold on. I'll give you ever seen that. Um, there's an a, an audio of a, I think his name is, uh, Gates and um, William Gates, the guy who had the, uh, the concept of a, a similar, he has a simulation theory that he presented to Neil degrasse Tyson. Yeah. Yeah. That was the president's scientific advisor. Obama's adviser for awhile. Was He really William Gates? Yeah. No kidding. Um, if it's the same guys, the same guy that found the computer codes in straight, sort of like a Samuel L. Jackson look alike. Yes. That's him. That's him. And that the conversation that he has with Neil degrasse Tyson where he says that they found self correcting computer code at the in the heart of string theory. Yeah. And, and then Neil degrasse Tyson goes, wait, wait, wait. Okay. Okay. Okay. Um, I want to hear the again like say this one more time. You found self correcting co I'm, I'm, I'm not sure if I understand what you're saying. Pull the video because that's it's uh, we watched this for the first time last night. Oh really? Yeah. Oh, this is, this is one of my favorites. I got taken down. I gotta find out that link got taken down. It was on reddit. Goddamn commies.

Speaker 6:          01:46:35       Who's doing that take? Why would you take doctor? Just self correcting Computer Code Correcting Cute Code Strength Area Gates. Let's see. Yeah, that's it. Strange computer code to south discovered concealed. If you just go to the, I found it. Just do what I just did. I found it again. Okay. Strange. Computer code discovered concealed in super string equations. This is a little bit of nonsense. The beginning for the first 30 seconds is like weird [inaudible] here. Play it

Speaker 3:          01:47:11       just that are behind your head right now. These are pictures of equations I've been for the last 15 years. Trying to answer the kinds of questions that my colleagues here, if it happened reasoning. And what I've come to understand is that there are these incredible pictures that contain all the information of a set of equations that are related to the string theory. And it's even more bizarre than that because when you then try to understand these pictures, you find out that buried in them, our computer codes, just like the type that you find in the browser when you go surf the web. And so I'm left with a puzzle of trying to figure out whether I live in the matrix or not.

Speaker 8:          01:47:49       You're blowing my mind at this moment. So you're saying, are you saying if your attempt to understand the fundamental operations of nature leads you to a set of equations that are indistinguishable from the equations that drive search engines and browsers on our computers? That is correct. So I'm still, I have to just be silent for a minute here. So you're saying as you dig deeper, you find computer code written in the fabric of the cosmos

Speaker 3:          01:48:26       into the equations that we want to use to describe the cosmos. Yes. Computer Code, Computer Code, strings of bits of ones and Zeros.

Speaker 8:          01:48:35       It's not just sort of resembles computer code. You're saying it is computer code.

Speaker 3:          01:48:40       It's not even just his computer code. It's a special kind of computer code that was invented by a scientist named Claude Shannon and the 1940s that's what we find very, very deeply inside the equations that occur in string theory and in general in systems that we get caught say are supersymmetric

Speaker 8:          01:49:04       time to go home. I think where are we going to go? So are you saying we are all just, there's some entity that programmed the universe and we're just expressions of their code?

Speaker 3:          01:49:17       Well I didn't say that

Speaker 8:          01:49:19       like the Matrix. Do you think about what you said those

Speaker 3:          01:49:22       codes are showing on the screen and behind you right now they don't look like codes, but these pictures which we call a dink groves or graphical representations of sets of equations that are based on codes. So this is in fact, to answer your question more directly, I have in my life come to a very strange place because I never expected that the movie, the Matrix might be an accurate of the place in which I live.

Speaker 8:          01:49:50       Well, Dan give you an argument that we don't live in the matrix please to quick very simple argument. There's a property that the real world right down here, cause that no mathematical equation hasn't, no solution of the equation has it? No. Okay. That no abstract object has here in the real world. It is always some moment, which is one of a series of passing moments in a mathematical equation doesn't have a flow of time in it. It just is. And this means but Lee, but I need him here and now this means that to me that the, the, the, the ancient metaphysical fantasy that we quote are just mathematics. Okay? CanNot be true because in a world that was just mathematics, there would be no moment of time as a function of time. It's a differential equations. But then you lay the solution out.

Speaker 3:          01:50:52       Taking, you keep using the word is, and I'm talking about the word describe. Okay.

Speaker 8:          01:50:58       You see the whole drive is fine, but let me, let me finish

Speaker 3:          01:51:01       please. Since we started with my discussion point is that I, I, you know, it's fun to talk about some deep metaphysical essence that sits behind physics before some of us, it's about trying to find the most accurate way to describe where we live. And so my statement is that in the description of our universe, that is a super symmetrical universe which we were going to test in the LHC. If you believe that description, I can show you the presence of these codes. That's my statement.

Speaker 6:          01:51:35       I'm fucked. I can't, can't go on shows over. What do you say to that? Like you, you listen to what these guys have just described and talked about. I disagree with the one guy saying that because we live in this moment in this, there's like this linear pattern to things that it can't be a mathematical equation. That's not true. That doesn't make any sense. That's like saying, um, if there is a car and the car is driving on a road that has been created by people, if it's, you know, if it's going from one distance, if it's traveling, that it can't possibly be an artificially created an environment that doesn't make any sense to me. It's like you're traveling through this thing just because you're experiencing the now and it's progressive and you know the past and you were looking to forward to the future and you're moving and you're in this mode. That doesn't mean it's not a mathematic representation.

Speaker 5:          01:52:33       Well, what comes to mind is that a lot of times in our formulas are our mathematic equations that I'm not a mathematician. It's the mind tendency is to lock down on the variables, but then it locks it down. So it's constantly changing.

Speaker 1:          01:52:50       What do you mean by that?

Speaker 5:          01:52:54       Meaning that we have, there is a tendency of mine to like to go into concepts as if they were solid and as if they were fixed and any kind of time that we do that we locked down the possibility. So if we can relax into whatever it's representing, then that representation can continue to be fluid and so therefore there's a lot of space and a lot of room to continue and the present moment is not just one thing.

Speaker 1:          01:53:20       I just don't understand the argument that if,

Speaker 1:          01:53:24       if mathematics are, if, if it's, I guess he's trying to say in a sense that because we're, we experienced individual moments, we have this moment, we're in this moment and that it's progressive that this wouldn't be the case if it was a mathematical equation. That doesn't make any sense to me. Maybe I'm just too dumb, but it seems to me that that leaves out the possibilities of yes, you could do that or yes you could. It could be a mathematical equation that you are experiencing or it could be that this idea of this computer code that they're finding is just simply a lot like so many other codes that we found and things that, that, that indicate that nature has some sort of a pattern to it. Like the FIBONACCI sequence. Like, you know, the idea that these codes that exist in nature, they're there, they don't exist because this is artificial, but they exist because nature essentially runs on mathematics.

Speaker 1:          01:54:23       So is nature artificial or is it what? I don't think anything has artificial or you can say everything's artificial. Yeah, well everything is natural. There's like everything on earth including like artificial chemicals were produced from things that are naturally occurring on earth. And human beings are a natural creation of the earth or of biological life itself and all the byproducts of human beings including things that we considered to not be natural. Our natural, just like a beehive is a natural creation of a B. You know, nuclear waste is the natural creation of the inquisitive human being. It's, they're not natural, but they are natural cause everything is natural. They don't exist outside of our manipulation, but we are a part of nature. So essentially all of our creations are in fact natural. I make this argument so often to try to undercut the notion that um, using technology to uh, develop your ability to contemplate the universe in consciousness, uh, that, that somehow is unnatural. I use that all the time but I'm thinking, you know, you could, you could say the same thing. Like everything is artificial. Everything is generated from something else. You know, the big bang came from somewhere. The mathematical formulas and the starting conditions came from some non

Speaker 4:          01:55:45       physical place outside of this universe. And so therefore they're artificial from this perspective. But I think that's the same saying the same thing as everything is natural, everything is artificial and everything is natural.

Speaker 6:          01:55:57       Yeah. Everything is natural. I think it's the, we have this idea of natural and artificial that we described with our foods. You know, we describe it with are the things that are healthy and non healthy about what we've created in our culture. But it's when you start using those same terms to describe human creation and then you start understanding the nature of human innovation and creativity in the first place. Like boy, I don't know if that's natural or not. How could it be any less natural than an octopus changing its shape to hide or, you know, changing. It's a skin tone to blend in with the environment. Isn't that natural? It's an artificial looked at the octopus is created in order to camouflage itself from predators or prey.

Speaker 4:          01:56:44       What do you, what do you think people are really pointing to when they say something's unnatural? Like what do you think they're really getting at are really trying to say it's bad. It's bad. Yeah. We gotta go back in time, go back to chopping wood and, sure. Yeah. It's bad according to what? Like according to what set of values or what conception of what the good is good in the universe. Right. I think we're constantly instantiating our utopias through, you know, what we, how we live in what we do. And like we're constantly deluding ourselves into thinking our conception of the universes. The correct conception. Hmm. And, and, and, but, but I'm like, we can't help it. Like I cannot help but say, you know, I think this is the most important thing. Compassion, wisdom. You know, like I've got my own conception of what's most important. But is there a

Speaker 6:          01:57:38       most important, I mean, is the word most important? The problem where the definition of most important? The problem. Because what is most important to you is not most important to others. Right. It's like it's a very personal idea of what's most important. What's most important to starving people right now is getting them food and water. Right. What's most important to the president is figuring out what to do about Israel and Gaza. What's most important? You know, there's like what is most important is a very personal thing.

Speaker 4:          01:58:06       Yeah. And yet there seem to be patterns, you know, like people have certain values and, and share those values with others and there's a collective code that seems to be running as well.

Speaker 6:          01:58:18       Yeah. And again, it boils back to what, what is that collective code? What's the purpose of it all? Yeah. To facilitate society, civilization and to move forward with the progression of innovation

Speaker 4:          01:58:34       till we become robots. Until he figured out a way to get out of here. I mean,

Speaker 6:          01:58:41       trend is obviously there, right? The symbiotic connection that we have to, you know, you don't want even leave your phone behind. You want to keep that sucker on you. If you leave it behind, you feel like you left a part of you back there. Yeah. Oh my God. I left my hand. You know, I got to go back and get my hand. I mean, it's almost similar. Yeah. My, uh, outer outer cortex. Yeah. There's a, there's something weird to that. Does something says something weird to our, our desire that this Marshall Mcluhan's idea, but we're the sex objects of the machine world, that what we're doing is we're giving birth like a caterpillar becoming a butterfly. We're unaware of our actions really ultimately being a part of this transition from the monkey body into this new transcendent thing. But then, then the big question is, what is that and what's the purpose of that? And if we do become that, does it just sit? Does it say, what's the point moving? No, I'm just going to sit here. What's the point in innovating? There's no need. What's the point in creating new ones to what do more of nothing? Fuck it. It's, it just sits there. So we show up on some planet someday and there's like these super complex artificial beings that were created by biological beings and then they just stopped and they all just sat around waiting for the next stage of existence. And it never came

Speaker 4:          02:00:02       in Buddhist cosmology actually it's described that way. Yeah. Actually the, uh, there's six realms in the Buddhist cosmology and one of the realms is the God realm. And in the God realm, the gods literally just abide in his formless awareness for like eons and eons and eons. But at some point the story goes, um, something changes and they die. They do have, they also are born and die, does formless realms aren't, aren't permanent. And so the, at some point they like come out of it and then they die. Then they get reborn into some other realm.

Speaker 6:          02:00:37       Well, if you stop and think about the birth and death of stars and planets, if these artificial beings live on planets, they have a life time, a lifespan, whether they like it or not because they're very solar system they exist in, is dependent upon that. Star burning a finite amount of fuel, right? Whether it's 500 billion years or whatever the hell your stars gotten its tank, when that sucker is out, it's going to Supernova. And that's a wrap son. There's no more artificial intelligence on that rock that's spinning around in space. And the question is, does the artificial intelligence that exists recognize that and feel the need to protect itself from this finite existence by building a spaceship and traveling physically traveling from dimension to dimension

Speaker 4:          02:01:26       or traveling within the dimension of consciousness and looking for a resolution there,

Speaker 6:          02:01:31       but does it have consciousness once it becomes artificial, what is con? Is consciousness purely something that the universe is created and we can't?

Speaker 1:          02:01:40       Oh, I doubt that. Really. Yeah. You think we'll be able to recreate consciousness?

Speaker 4:          02:01:45       I think if we, I mean I'm, I'm, this is just a kind of guests, but I think if we create a suitable substrate for consciousness, consciousness will appear. And that's based on my assumption that, you know, consciousness appears. Where wait, where there's something happening. There's some sense of it, of Kering to something.

Speaker 1:          02:02:14       Well, it depends on what we're calling consciousness. Yeah, I use it in a simple way, like just basic awareness, like just kind of the awareness of like being in this room of, of, of sight, of sound. So animal and even insects have consciousness in that sense. And Alford North

Speaker 4:          02:02:29       head, you know, he, he sort of presumed that even Adams have a most fundamental sense of consciousness that he called prehension. Mm. Um, and I don't know if that's, it's kind of like a pantheistic perspective, but um, I, I think everything is imbued at the most fundamental level with consciousness. But that's, that's probably because I've been spent my whole life exploring consciousness.

Speaker 1:          02:02:53       Well, you, when you say everything, do you mean like physical objects as well? Like a desk? Like does this desk have consciousness? Yeah, look at the most basic level, some form of, but non measurable. So completely just

Speaker 4:          02:03:06       conscious. Radical consciousness is consciousness. Consciousness isn't by definition immeasurable. You can't measure consciousness because it's not a quantity.

Speaker 1:          02:03:16       Right. Why would you assume that in and out of it? An object's possess it then.

Speaker 2:          02:03:21       Okay.

Speaker 4:          02:03:22       It's, it's sort of just comes from a comp comes from the deepest states of meditation that I've experienced. This kind of sense of knowing that everything is at the fund, that most fundamental level consciousness itself and so that there isn't something outside of consciousness. You know, Adam's couldn't exist outside of consciousness. It's just, it's just a felt sense I guess. It's hard to describe. Like I don't have like a really solid argument for it

Speaker 5:          02:03:48       and even if something appears solid at a very microscopic level, we can see things moving around. Like even though this table feels solid, it's not completely solid.

Speaker 1:          02:04:00       Right, of course. Yeah. Every atom is mostly air empty space.

Speaker 5:          02:04:04       Yeah. So at a sense like you know, I've had experiences too where the concentration becomes so strong that things just start to break down and everything seems to be dissolving and reconstructing and dissolving and reconstructing.

Speaker 1:          02:04:18       It isn't just, just the perceptions of your own mind, isn't this just the, the, your, your mind has this ability to perceive its a, its surroundings and its environment. And in meditation you're altering the parameters, you're changing the, the influences, your, you're changing the physical state, the flow of the neurotransmitters and

Speaker 6:          02:04:38       all these different things are changing how you view the environment itself. But you're not really changing the environment at all.

Speaker 4:          02:04:47       Yeah. Mitigates, it depends on how you look at it. Cause no, I mean I'm not changing it and then yes, I am changing it by doing this particular practices.

Speaker 6:          02:04:57       You're changing it in that you're changing your perceptions, perceptions changed the way your interface with it.

Speaker 4:          02:05:02       Yeah. I think this goes back to the paradox of like it is very paradoxical. Yeah. Like the paradox of, you know, do it, can we describe this from the outside objective objectively and like that's the most true perspective or do we describe it as, as the subjective conscious experience of it and on which mode, which is more true. And I keep going back to like you can't reduce one to the other or conflate one to the other. Um, entirely. Otherwise you basically are just sort of propping up a particular perspective as the ultimate truth. Um, I dunno, I think, I think there's something completely disenchanted about seeing everything as physical objects and, and this as a kind of just like hallucination to make us feel better so we can continue to propagate. I think there's something fundamentally wrong about that on the level of being a conscious being. And yet I also see, you know, the tendency for um, people to conflate their own experiences with the external universe as being like highly problematic too. That's a funny, yeah.

Speaker 6:          02:06:01       Word. Disenchanted. That's a funny way of cause it is, you know, it is kind of your, your, the way your perception of it.

Speaker 2:          02:06:12       Okay.

Speaker 6:          02:06:14       Is that it's almost like this mystical view of it. This is beautiful, airy fairy view of it and makes it more exciting. And so like to think of them is to think of it and more stoic terms or more, you know, more, um, I don't know what the word I would use, just more, more clearly defined terms. It's like not as fun.

Speaker 4:          02:06:45       Does that make sense? It does. Um,

Speaker 4:          02:06:50       it's also, I think like Emily was saying, like the moment we solidify reality, then like we lose the background, you know, that we'd lose the sense that we don't actually completely know that every story we've ever told, you know, as a species has ended up being wrong at some level. You know, it's not, it's not actually did like the big bang. You know, at some point we're going to realize that story was the best story we could come up with to describe the evolution of the physical universe or the development of it or whatever. But at some point, you know, we're going to discover something that just blows our minds again, and then we're gonna have to come up with a new story that can make sense of that and, and we're going to get solidified about that. We're going to think, oh, that's the way it really is. Hmm. And so I think there's something about certainty, you know, and really thinking we have it worked out that it becomes problematic at some level. That's kind of the

Speaker 6:          02:07:47       beauty of existence, right? Is that there's a lot of mystery to this thing, right?

Speaker 4:          02:07:50       Yeah. It's like half the half the fun. Right? Exactly. Yes. A disenchantment. Like it's part of that right

Speaker 5:          02:07:55       comes from like, I feel like people can get disconnected from their hearts and that can be airy fairy too, but it's, it's that is real to, to be up in the mind and the brain and then forget that there is, there is the feelings and the tenderness and the vulnerability in a, in a positive way. Cause there's actually a lot of power in the vulnerability. So, um, there's some sort of balance that I think it comes in to play from some of the eastern traditions and then some of the western traditions because I, I feel that balance too in the room as we're talking, um, between, you know, opening more into the mystical part of things and then also, you know, needing to concept, naming the rational mind, needing the science. Um, and where is that balance in our modern world? I don't, I'm not sure.

Speaker 6:          02:08:39       Well, yeah, that's the real question, right? Where's the balance in the modern world? Because the modern world is essentially without balance. That's the number one criticism of it is that we're raping the earth and torturing our, our, our planet and robbing it of its resources and polluting the oceans and all that jazz. And that there isn't a balance to it all. And that the experience is just what it is for you. You, you know, you live this life and your perceptions and your ideas are essentially what flavor it for you. And if you, if you choose to be mister no nonsense, you still die. You know, you live, you die and that's it. And you saw blind spot. Yeah. You still limitations. Yeah, most certainly. And um, the, the, the concept of consciousness in this way is more empowering or at least gives you a better feeling about the life that you're living and may enhance that experience, may make that experience a more pleasurable ride

Speaker 5:          02:09:41       and it may impact others around you cause a mirror and everything else.

Speaker 6:          02:09:45       Yeah. Well, definitely, you know, when I'm around people that are super positive, I feel better. It's this, that's undeniable. I don't understand it, but I do, you know, inherently this is like a part of you that grasps it. But, uh, it's undeniable. And when you're around pessimistic people, it's a huge drag. That's a huge drag to be around super negative people. Like I remember I had this really negative girlfriend once when I broke up with her. I remember dropping her off and driving away going, oh my God, I'm free. What if there was a, uh, a side of things? It was negative. She would find it and just start pecking at it,

Speaker 4:          02:10:21       eh. And B, what about fat man? Oh, it was brutal.

Speaker 6:          02:10:26       It was brutal. And that, that, you know, if you can find the opposite of that, find someone who's got a good take. Like, Hey, this is what it is. But from here, well, we can learn to never do that again. And so this is an awesome blessing and that we've learned a lesson from this and we're going to move forward. And you know, we still have love and community and friendship and there's a lot of people that look at things that way and there's so much more fun to be around. It just makes the experience of life itself more exciting and in that sense what we, what people are doing with Buddhism or TM or spending a lot of time in isolation tanks or it's sort of a workaround for biology, sort of a, a framework for developing your consciousness as you manage your biology.

Speaker 4:          02:11:15       Does that make sense? Yeah, I think that's a valid way of talking about it.

Speaker 1:          02:11:20       We might've run out of mind fucks in this podcast. I think we hit it. We hit a wall self correcting

Speaker 6:          02:11:27       Peter Code at James Gates and Neil Tyson, my thrown us into a wall. It's just too, how did you guys get involved in all this stuff? Like what, what made you gravitate towards this as a young person? Is it just something you discovered early on and sort of slowly but surely it became a massive part of your life?

Speaker 4:          02:11:49       Um, for I think for, for both of us, that's probably true. I won't speak for Emily, but uh, for, for me, I grew up with hippie parents, you know, uh, new agey parents. And so the notion of meditation and consciousness was, was kind of part of the dialectic growing up. Where'd you grow up? I grew up in Asheville, North Carolina.

Speaker 1:          02:12:09       Aww. I love that place. That's where Dunkin's from. Yeah. That's where we live now. You guys live there? Yeah. Place is so awesome. I don't want to tell people about it. So awesome. When I was there, I was walking down the street. I was like, this is like, it doesn't exist in anywhere else. The word's getting out, believe me. Dammit. Yeah. Now it's really out. That place is amazing. That's an amazing, amazing town. It's quite interesting. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          02:12:35       It's so unusual. Like I was there with a buddy and we'll Dunkin and another buddy of mine, we were walking on the street and go into this restaurant and then we went to this bar. I was like, where else is there a place like this? It's like this small town of really likeminded folks. Very Open minded, very progressive, but very small. What's the population there? A Hundred K I think it isn't. So it's very boulder sized. That's which is another similar town like that. Yeah. It's very sad. But you guys are like tucked up in the mountains.

Speaker 4:          02:13:07       Well we're, we're in a hauler. The hauler. We like it. Yeah. That's amazing. How'd you get there? Um, I grew up just outside of there, a little town called Mars hill and I grew up two hours away. And Wilkesboro small town. Yes. And you gravitated towards Asheville. How well we, we actually lived in boulder for about a decade. Really? Yeah. We were working, she was working at Naropa University.

Speaker 6:          02:13:32       I went to school there. Oh, that's that freaky hippie university. Right. Buddhist inspired we, we call it the Buddhist inspired Harvard. They have a class in Zen flower arrangement. You Cubana. Yeah. It didn't take that one, but I like, this is hilarious. You get an accredited class and Zen flower arrangement. The only place that I know of. Yeah. Yeah. Which is also a kind of similar, it's kind of similar kind of vibe. Yeah. Boulder most certainly does. And another place that's tucked in the mountains and it's like there's something about mountains that are so humbling, like you just look at it like you can't be that important. Are you seeing what I'm seeing? Like your daily life and troubles? They, they are balanced in perspective by the images that you're seeing of the most spectacular versions of art that nature's created. And then that's what the mountains are to me, like snow covered, tree covered, whatever.

Speaker 6:          02:14:28       They are seeing a lake at the bottom of a canyon and just like nature's stunning works of art. And the, the just the sheer vast magnitude of them, like the Rockies forces people to sort of humility. Oh yeah. Sort of like beach towns, you know like why are beach towns, so why is everybody so chill by the beach? We'll look at that fucking ocean, man. Who are you? How are you taking yourself so seriously, look at that thing. It's fast. You can't see the end and it's all water and it's moving up and back. And at any point in time it could just rise up and a thousand mile high swell and take out the entire planet. That's right. Yeah. There's something about nature that's like super important. So I, people that live in a, in a place where they don't get a chance to see it, you know, in New York City in a sense is humbling in its own way because as we said, everything is natural.

Speaker 6:          02:15:27       You know, human beings creating cities are not much different than a beehive. It's just we're way better at making shit than bees are. So we make skyscrapers. But when you're in Manhattan, like, uh, last time I was there, I was staying at this hotel and we were pretty high up and uh, you know, you open up your window and you look out the window like, whoa, this is crazy. This is so futuristic and bizarre. We're in the middle of it. Like all the buildings are around us. We're seeing all these people moving around inside of their windows. Some of them I'm sure with binoculars, telescopes and shit peering out at all the different stories that are playing out in the various little cubicles and boxes around them. Absolutely. Yeah. But, um, I think that, uh, the, the, at least to me, the most peaceful version of that, those, the, you know, that kind of imagery is the natural version, the real natural version as far as like non men created I should say. You know, the, the mountains and there's something about it like, especially like a place like Asheville or a place like boulder sort of like, uh, it, it,

Speaker 2:          02:16:34       yeah.

Speaker 6:          02:16:34       It's just defined by its environment. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          02:16:38       Okay.

Speaker 6:          02:16:39       So, um, the Buddhist geeks thing, one of the things that I thought that was interesting that you said that I find too is that you start doing it and people start getting connected to it and then you feel like you kind of stuck in it like a in that like, boy, I have a responsibility now people are enjoying this.

Speaker 4:          02:16:53       Yes. Getting maybe, hopefully getting some value from it.

Speaker 6:          02:16:57       Yeah. Well it at the very least being entertained on a bus, you know, or on a plane or, or what have you. Are you stuck in a commute? You know, at the very least it's that. Yeah. How often you guys do it? Huh?

Speaker 4:          02:17:09       We do a podcast once a week, so we do like a interview like this or a conversation like this, probably once a week.

Speaker 6:          02:17:16       Now when you do those, do you prepare for them? Like do you have like a theme or do you have like questions that you lay out beforehand and

Speaker 4:          02:17:24       usually, yeah, usually it's a, with a, with a person or group that, you know, we're exploring a particular topic like, um, and we've explored a lot around the interface of technology and Buddhist practice, um, various intersection points of how Buddhism is sort of interfacing with psychology and science and technology and you know, various aspects of culture. So we'll usually kind of go into one of those intersection points and explore it with someone who's really been working at that interface. And so who is, you know, in some ways the most, um, informed

Speaker 2:          02:17:56       and

Speaker 4:          02:17:57       in terms of their ignorance about what's going on at that interface and just kind of explore it and see what happens. Um, and can you give me example of like one of the recent episodes read today? Yeah, sure. So we recently, uh, I talked to, um, a neuroscientist named David Wago who's at Harvard and he's a contemplative neuroscientists. Um, and Jake Davis, who's a Buddhist cognitive philosopher, and we sort of explored some of their recent work around finding and discovering a neuroscience of enlightenment. Um, and they've been sort of working with the question, is there a neuroscience of enlightenment? Can we see what enlightenment and quotes looks like in the brain? Um, and is that even possible philosophically? Like, is it enlightenment one thing or is it many things? Um, and so we really just went through and explored some of their ideas around enlightenment. What is it, uh, what conceptions are they using?

Speaker 4:          02:18:47       A, what have they found in their, in their, um, in their research because David's been working a lot with, um, folks, uh, like Shinzen young who has been meditating for 40 years and who you know, has a really, you know, kind of, um, complex system of meditation and mindfulness practice and it's something that he designed to be able to be scientifically studied. So they've been sort of putting advanced meditators and various fmri machines and sort of seeing what happens when they do various kinds of tasks, seeing what happens when they have these kind of peak moments, you know, what actually is occurring in the, in the nervous system, seeing if they can come up with a model to describe that. Neuroscientifically

Speaker 6:          02:19:24       that's fascinating. The Fmr Ri is a really interesting stuff. Oh yeah. And

Speaker 4:          02:19:30       have you ever been in one? It's so weird. No, no. It's like a shamonic drum beating through your head. Really. It's really bizarre. And when I, when we got in there for one of these meditation studies afterwards, I was like, are they taking into account the fact that the FMRI machine itself is like a completely altered state experience? It's just a huge magnet. Your, yeah.

Speaker 6:          02:19:51       I've been in an MRI before. She's similar. You hear that tone, Dum, Dum, Dum, Dum. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          02:19:57       This one had like the one we went to like had, I mean what sounded like drum beats and all kinds of weird stuff. I mean, I was, wow. Yeah. I mean, I don't know if it was like that for you now. That's what it sounded like. Yeah, yeah.

Speaker 6:          02:20:08       It was weird. Yeah. I talked to a neuroscientist and they were explaining that there's some issues with Fmr eyes where they're, they're trying to use them for a crime investigation and they're being used by people who don't understand the limitations of the technology. So someone was accused of a crime in India, crew accused of murder and convicted by an Fmr. I result because the FMRs showed functional knowledge of the crime scene. Ooh, yeah. Ooh, exactly. And she was very concerned about this because her perceptions of it where you could by reviewing the case itself and by reviewing the information, you could give someone functional knowledge of a crime scene without them actually having been there while the crime scene was going on. And that, so if you could read that there's functional knowledge of a crime scene, it doesn't mean that the person is actually been there while the crime was being played out.

Speaker 6:          02:21:07       I mean there's, there's people that have functional knowledge of all sorts of places like Mount Rushmore and put, you know, like if you play that in some folks head that are like deeply studied history and been paying a lot of tension, you might be able to show some sort of a functional knowledge of the area itself. If they have, specially if they have a vested interest in studying this, like they're being accused of a murder, you know, you would think there'd be a lot of intensity and emotional connection to that. But these concepts like all these different things is when it comes to technology and the understanding of the human brain. There's so they're evolving right now in front of us so rapidly. Yeah, it's true. I mean

Speaker 4:          02:21:46       just recently in the contemplative neuroscience field, they discovered that when you're not doing anything that is like your baseline state, that you are in fact doing something. And they just sort of, that was one of the big insights that came out of a contemplative neuroscience was that the default mode network of the brain is actually the selfing network. It's the network that is constantly constructing the sense of identity and referencing one self even when you're not doing anything. So that was, you know, the assumption prior to that was just like, when you're not doing anything, nothing's happening. Um, but no, actually a lot of stuff's happening. It's like yourself program is running basically.

Speaker 6:          02:22:23       Yeah. What, what? Well, we don't understand. What the fuck is, is that self program. That's the problem. How much of that is just keeping the heart beating? How much of that is maintaining a normal state without freaking out and ripping your clothes off, running into traffic, and what causes you to freak out and rip your clothes off and running into traffic. And do you find that having these shows and doing all these podcasts has given you a like a window that you would have normally not had before? Oh, totally, totally. I can't separate now out the experience of talking to all these people and exploring some of the topics that we explore from my experience now of how I understand the world, it's just, it's so intertwined. I'm sure you can kind of relate to that. Yeah. That's why I wanted to ask you because it becomes like a part of your life is not just about having these conversations but about broadcasts in these conversations.

Speaker 6:          02:23:19       Yeah. And exploring them, not just through your own curiosity but through trying to either a luminate or figure out a way to express these ideas across where you think they're going to be accepted or understood the best. Understood is probably the best way to describe it. Like the way it's going to interface with the most amount of people. Yeah, I mean sometimes I think it's one of the most grandiose things to do is to start a podcast or to start, you know, to be a media person. And I sometimes wonder if I myself as a result,

Speaker 5:          02:23:55       just being a, he started the podcast seven years ago, so I've kind of been on the periphery of it and just watching it from the outside perspective too. It's fairly interesting to see how like his podcasts and the stuff that he talks about in his own development as, I don't know if you can relate to it has really come across in each episode as it's, and now we have an archive of seven years of like development of, you know, his own understanding and then how everything just kind of co like converges. Now we're really exploring the convergence.

Speaker 6:          02:24:24       Well, the beautiful thing about a podcast is that you don't have someone telling you what the subject of today's going to be. You don't have someone telling you this is what you should be interested in. You know, you, you find these unique individual visions because a podcast and some of them are ridiculous, stupid and some of them are awesome, you know, and what's ridiculously stupid to me is awesome to someone else. And that's the kind of the beauty of podcasting and it goes along with what we're talking about. I think when it comes to technology and social media, it's like the, the interfacing with ideas, the ability to exchange information. It's all sort of radically changing right in front of us. And you know, podcasting is just a part of that. Absolutely. How, um, how do you feel like you're going to take this thing into the future? Do you have any plans for it? Are you trying to expand it or you are you, uh, you're nodding virtual, virtual reality's next? I think like Oculus, oculus rift style, podcasting. Well, I mean, part of it, well, that could happen.

Speaker 5:          02:25:24       Um, we'll see if that's popular, but Geez, you know, I think, uh, you know, for us,

Speaker 4:          02:25:31       you know, we're doing Buddhist geeks as a media project, but we're also, you know, meditation teachers and we work a lot with other folks. Um, and we've trained, you know, with, with various Buddhist teachers. So for us, we're wanting to make a space both for, you know, these conversations but also for people to practice together, um, in virtual space. So that's a lot of our focus lately is on how to reinvent the Buddhist practice tradition for the 21st century. And a big part of that that we're working on now is, is doing retreats online, you know, periods of intensive, immersive practice that happened in the context of your life. And also, you know, we're building what we're conduct Buddhist geeks Dojo, which is going to be kind of, we're describing it as an early version of the Matrix for training your mind, the Buddhist geeks Dojo, the Buddhist geeks Doge, and what does that entail? What's going to be in there? It'll, it'll be at least a place for people to meditate together to talk about what's happening in their practice, which basically as their life, and to find a community of folks who are kind of on a similar journey of, of cultivating certain kinds of states of mind and certain understandings. Why Buddhism though? Or why not? Why call it something? Is that where it gets me when you're talking about rebelling against Buddhism, right?

Speaker 5:          02:26:45       Yeah. Well we've rebelled and we've rebelled against her and rebellion currently. Yeah. I mean it's like if we don't call it Buddhism, we'll call it something else. And then there's a framework around that. And so it's like, I can't get outside of the framework no matter how smart or a framework, no matter how hard I try and my training and has been with some really awesome people in the Buddhist tradition and I'm not going to be able to just let that, you know, it's always going to impact me and influence me.

Speaker 4:          02:27:15       And there's something about the flavor of that tradition and what it reveals, hippies

Speaker 5:          02:27:22       changing and it's changing. Look, I mean

Speaker 4:          02:27:25       it's changed. You guys are changing it a little bit because of technology and you're interfacing with technology. I mean, yeah, I mean, we're just a small part of it. I mean, how else is it changing? I mean,

Speaker 5:          02:27:36       the science is coming in really influencing it. The mindfulness movement is very

Speaker 4:          02:27:41       much influenced, again, you could call mindfulness a form of secular Buddhism. Um, I mean, certainly the guy that, that had it, that's had the most impact on the mindfulness movement. Jon Kabat Zinn was spent, you know, a number of decades studying Buddhism in India and Asia. So, I mean, those things are very big shifts in terms of how it's being practiced and the context that it's being held in. And, well, that's funny that you said the secular, because most people would consider Buddhism to be a, some sort of a, or maybe one of the only saccular religions. And it's, it's true in some cases, in other cases, it's, it's like a lot of other religions, a lot of what's the creepiest forms of Buddhism? It must be, throw him under the bus, creepiest for feel good. What's, what's the most dogmatic, the most, uh, ideology filled? I mean, I must be right there.

Speaker 4:          02:28:39       I think Bikram Yoga. No, I mean there are lots of forms that you know, that are very rigid in terms of how they're taught and what to believe when you do them. I mean, I think that's hard to escape in a certain way because when people find something that was really powerful and works, they get really fixated on it. Right? Like wearing orange robes. Yeah. Like wearing orange robes, although that's not really that popular anymore, at least in its current form in the west. It, monasticism is not definitely not taking off. So that's one way it's changing. Also, it's moved away from monasticism and toward this more kind of, um, lay centered life, that being integrated with everyone else being integrated in your life. You know, how it is. And that's, I think that's true of most religions that are doing well. It's like they've, they've moved away from the transcendent and toward the imminent.

Speaker 4:          02:29:24       You know, they've, they're reconceiving divinity as something that exists in your life as it is. It's not something that's beyond your life in some way that, that something's wrong with your life or your, you know, your body that, you know, this is a sin full, terrible vessel that is completely limited. I mean, and it is in one sense, but in another sense like that's just, that's an intermediary insight from, from, you know, from my experience, what are the confining aspects of calling it Buddhism though? Like what, what is, what are the pitfalls of that besides hippies? You definitely going to get some problematic if not that, oh, I love hippies. Don't get me wrong. Yeah. Same Pete hippies come in many shades. There's, there's legit hippies and then there's like really annoying hippies that just sort of, you know, the, they use the hippie framework to just be annoying. [inaudible] sure. I mean, I'll, I'll say one can finding thing is that um, Buddhism as a religion, I mean at least in terms of how we understand religion, is it tax free? Uh, is it tax free? Yeah. Do you have tax free exemption the same way that other religions too? We, we personally don't, but you could, you could do that. Yeah. You'll give fucking chase down. Don't do it.

Speaker 4:          02:30:37       It gets really, really hairy when you don't want to pay taxes. They go, oh, really? Time to take a little closer. Look at the Buddhist Geek Organization. See what you're doing on Saturday nights there. Infiltrate.

Speaker 5:          02:30:48       Yeah. I think with anything like Buddhism, I mean you inherit, but choosing that framework, we inherit all, we inherit it. And so there's a lot about, um, religions and spirituality in general that is not, that I don't personally like, you know, so, um, I think that there is a, there's a tendency to project, I mean you brought in the word divinity, so I'll use it like to project our divinity onto the teachers are onto some sort of system and um, it can disempowering for a lot of people. People can get trapped and beliefs that, you know, we've had been carried forward for, you know, years and centuries that aren't, isn't forwarding anymore. Um, and so that sense like by choosing to go under Buddhism, we're also choosing to, you know, work on how we can evolve, how we think about it. And one thing that I really like is the, is the practices themselves, um, the mind training aspect of it. That's what's been really beneficial to me and that's one of the reasons why I've chosen to continue because if its impact,

Speaker 1:          02:31:54       the mind training aspects of it. Like what, what, what, what do you think is like the tangible benefits of this mind training aspect of it that you personally experience?

Speaker 5:          02:32:05       Personally I can say personally I feel much, much more, much more open. I'm much more generous, compassionate. There's a lot more freedom I can get stuck on the smaller sense of self. Meaning, you know, I have these thoughts of like unworthiness or self contraction or hatred or any of those, you know, biological kind of urges. And at the same time they're so transient and they're so not who I am. And I see that very, very clearly that it kind of diminishes in just a second. I'm on the good days. Sometimes it's more intense and I've learned to really work with that and learn how to see clearly what's happening so that I have the freedom to really choose how to live my life in a much more full way.

Speaker 1:          02:32:56       So really is like a work around for a lot of the biological pitfalls I think. So I think it's a way of working with the situation as it is. And then making the most of it. If someone came along with another name, no, like Buddhist, like the word, the word Buddhist. If someone came along with, uh, another name for a similar practice, do you think that it would be accepted? Yeah,

Speaker 5:          02:33:18       there's some, I think the Buddhist tradition and especially in the West has been modified, like mindfulness based stress reduction. I mean, some of these different techniques are taking from the ancient techniques. Um, there's something about grooves and consciousness and patterns like we were talking about earlier. So by going under Buddhism, we're kind of riding in those grooves and they're not all bad, you know?

Speaker 4:          02:33:42       Yeah, no, there's something, I don't know if my own experience, and this, it's a little embarrassing in a secular context to talk about this because it, it's weird to say, you know, for whatever reason I just fell in love with the forms and the, and the, the ritual and the, you know, and the, just the feel of it, the aesthetic of Buddhism. I first, for some reason, I just immediately felt a sense of being at home when I went to the first meditation retreat and I was there practicing and I was like, oh wow. And I felt this deep sense of connection with that particular form. And for whatever reason, it just like it for me, it unlocked a lot, very rapidly that I don't know that would have been otherwise possible if I was trying to do some sort of practice that I didn't really connect with that much. You know, something about just the love of the form and the aesthetic itself, uh, that I can't really explain except that I've always liked Asian stuff

Speaker 5:          02:34:35       and the inclining of the mind towards, um, awakenings or awakening, you know, that framework and itself as it's an interesting, um, inclination. So, you know, just like we had search for the holy grail, we mentioned that earlier, the inclination towards some kind of inquiry into okay. And the question presented itself earlier, like who, who is, who are we, who is this? Um, and I've found that the techniques and the forms have been really revealing in that way.

Speaker 4:          02:35:05       The deification of the teachers are real issue though, right? The, they're really does become an issue with any time any person is the distributor of knowledge or information. They take this position yes. And elevated as challenging. And I think the best teachers, you know, we're learning as we become hopefully a little better as teachers, is that the best teachers use that situation to help people kind of gain a confidence in their own experience and to be able to, um, no freedom for themselves through their own practices. Of paying attention, of being with things and in that sense that the best teachers are the ones that make themselves irrelevant. Um, to the best teachers. The best teachers make themselves completely irrelevant I think. And process can be empowering in itself. Yeah. Everyone's so calm. Involvement. The, did the Buddhist ever get into like death metal or driving too fast or, oh yeah.

Speaker 4:          02:36:02       Racing cars driving too fast. You got, hold it. There's a whole movement in the, in the west of the Dharma punks, which are Dharma punks, the Dharma punks. So who are based here in La. Um, they, they were like basically group of folks that are my friends. They're, yeah, they're our friends and uh, you know, their whole s you know, they, they have like major house parties with huge, you know, music bands. And do they do drugs? Um, that movement? Not really. Well, I think a lot of them had done a lot of drugs and so part of the movement is actually about being able to be okay without the drugs. And I think so that's part of the reason a lot of people are attracted to that movement. What about drinking? Uh, we drink. Yeah. I had a glass of wine a little bit. Or did you get hammered? I don't really, I don't get hammered. So if someone's at the bar and they pass your shot shots

Speaker 5:          02:36:53       don't like it. Don't like the feeling. Yeah. It doesn't feel good. I feel like crap afterwards. Definitely afterwards. Yeah. It's not the afterwards part. Like how do you feel before, how do you feel daring and how you feel afterwards? Like if I take the average of that, I don't feel very good, so I don't tend to, yeah, that's personally don't tend to

Speaker 4:          02:37:10       boot. Koski uh, used to get upset at stoners. Duncan and I were talking about this last night because they didn't

Speaker 6:          02:37:16       have to pay for the experience. They didn't have the hangover. The boot cows be Bukovsky felt like you earned your drunk with the hangover. You know, he'd love that.

Speaker 4:          02:37:27       He loves the earth. There's a hangover from being stoned. It's just a little more subtle really. You feel like that? Yeah, sure.

Speaker 6:          02:37:34       What do you feel like the hangover for being stoned is? I don't feel it at all.

Speaker 4:          02:37:37       It's a, it's a quality of, of kind of a little bit slugginess of the mind and have an increase in self referencing talk for me like of of like more like subtle fear and anxiety and self preoccupation. Um, that's what I've noticed in Wa. That's fascinating. Like in what way? In in the sense that I described like, you know, after I've smoked marijuana, like during its, you know, it's an insightful opening experience, but after there's a sense of kind of being groggy and sludgy and like everything is like less clear and less open than before. And so there's a quality of, of kind of like s like contraction that comes after the expansion. So that's what I would describe it. It's a, it's like a mental contraction. The headaches and the, no, it's not as physical as alcohol. Do you guys

Speaker 6:          02:38:30       getting that North Carolina Week? That's what's going on. You've got to get some California weed.

Speaker 4:          02:38:34       Well you remember we lived in boulder, so sativas right. Oh you remember we lived in Boulder, so we, we've, we've tried all varieties. Yeah, I'm sure. Maybe it's a physical thing though. I don't experience that. Maybe it's the mental training that we've done and being a little more sensitive to that. I don't know.

Speaker 6:          02:38:52       No, I don't know. But I don't get sludgy afterwards. There's no sludge. Enos.

Speaker 4:          02:38:56       Yeah. It could be personal differences, but that's also

Speaker 6:          02:38:59       Endeca. There's a just a job that which is a wide margin by a wide margin. The majority of what most people are getting, it's easier to grow. It's more more common and it's what a lot of people are looking for. It's got the more that narcotic effect, whereas the sativas have more of like an uplifting different sort of, uh, and then there's also the eating of it, which is much more introspective. That turning much more cycle. Much more psychedelic.

Speaker 4:          02:39:26       That's right. Yeah. I mean, so personally I don't have anything against a mind altering substances. I think meditation is a mind altering substance. I'm more just curious about like how do we use the substances? Are we trying to get away from our experience? Are we trying to have insights every, are we trying, because the problem with so many substances, you get into a pattern of, of, of, of really trying to cope with the difficulty of experience and then getting addicted to that state as a way of dealing. And I think that's where the problem comes in from a kind of mind training and contemplative perspective is like

Speaker 6:          02:40:00       that's a good way to describe it because that is what sort of happens, right? That's, that's why people get drunk. That's why people do pills. Yeah. It's like this, this existence, it's so confusing in itself that you just want to escape and then you escape and that escape becomes

Speaker 5:          02:40:14       a trap and you get locked in. Then you have to keep getting the same thing. Try it. If you stop, then you got to deal with all this shit that comes up. It doesn't feel good. Yeah. And then you got to go to Rehab and try to wean your body off the escape.

Speaker 4:          02:40:28       And if you're a Buddhist teacher, you got to be concerned about how everyone perceives you because you're not perfect.

Speaker 1:          02:40:32       It's cause you're all pilled up. That's right. Yeah. You can't have a pilled up Buddhist teacher. Is there any Buddhist teachers that are all fucked up on Adderall?

Speaker 4:          02:40:39       Uh, oh there, there as many Buddhist teachers doing as many weird things as there are

Speaker 1:          02:40:45       any other humans I'm pretty sure. But wouldn't you hope that at least overall there'd be more improvement in their overall character or ability to cope with this existence?

Speaker 5:          02:40:56       I think there is overall, I think people inclined towards openness and then there's a balance between, you know, the multiple levels of development. I don't know, meaning that, you know, just because we develop and spiritual context. Then you also have, you know, your social context and um, so we have to continue to develop evenly, you know? Yeah.

Speaker 4:          02:41:21       I think that's one of the trickiest paradox is like you can become really good at being in this free, liberated, open, spacious mind. Some people are incredibly good at it and you'd just with them and you have a hit of that, you know? But like their sex life is completely messed up, you know, and they like abuse small dogs and children. And really, I mean, I'm, I'm, I'm a, I'm exaggerating a little bit, not that much. I mean, there are people who have had profound, profound realizations of the interconnection of all things and they're profoundly dysfunctional and other levels. And I've met many of those folks and have been, does folks at times you have been those folks? Oh yeah. I've been dysfunctional and you know, messed up and doing stupid stuff

Speaker 1:          02:42:02       while you were practicing Buddhism. Sure. What was the influence that caused you to be dysfunctional and fucked up

Speaker 4:          02:42:08       while your parents? Usually my, the insights that have come from

Speaker 1:          02:42:11       Buddhism that direction. So the insights that have, they stabilized me really sure. Sort of like a, a psychedelic experience can make someone go crazy permanently

Speaker 4:          02:42:22       or temporarily. Yeah, I think I've, I've, I've gone through periods. I, I'd say less. It's been less the Buddhist meditation as much as it's been like healing just parts of my past, you know, being a human and having been through difficult times, you know, I think more of it's probably been psychological. And one of the common things that happens, you know, in a spiritual context is that people use their spiritual practice to bypass those human psychological issues. It's called spiritual bypassing. Um, so for me, I think part of what happened is I bypassed for a long time and rent really deep in a particular way and then had to come back around and deal with like my human experience, uh, on, on a level that I hadn't wanted to before. And then it was really painful.

Speaker 1:          02:43:06       So it's almost like you have these sort of confining aspects of your personality that because of your perceptions, those can finding aspects are probably good. And then Buddhism comes along and blows down those boundaries and you're like, I'm not ready for those yet. And then you freak out for a little bit and then you come back around.

Speaker 5:          02:43:26       Yeah. Yeah. And then the integration part I think is kind of what you're talking about too, is, is going deep in the contemplative space. And then if we're inclining our minds towards, you know, seeing the reality of like, what's really happening here? Like how are we constructing this reality? And that starts to peel back. You know, there are moments where it's like, so there's a lot of freedom. And then at the same time it's like, oh crap. Like I got to figure out how to integrate this in my life. And maybe that, those insights of the vastness and the spaciousness and that, you know, we're not just our bodies and we're not just our limited views of who we are. You know, those insights have to be integrated into the way that we live our life. And that's the challenging part. That's when, you know, the rubber meets the road and, um, that, you know, take psychological work.

Speaker 5:          02:44:15       It takes bodywork. It takes really, it's humbling. It's very humbling because then at the putting the teacher on the pedestal, going back to that, it's like, oh, okay, we're actually all in this together. And you know, maybe, you know, I've traveled these, these entire worlds and can help other people navigate them. And at the same time, you know, we have to come back as a collective and, and like, you know what? You got to wash the dishes. He's got to take out the trash and then, you know, if you have kids you got to raise the kids and um, and how do you do that without, without killing each other, you know? So

Speaker 1:          02:44:50       as more of our teachers, Jack Kornfield says often you have to remember your Buddha nature and your zip code both and Ryan and the zip code part I think can be hard if you've been focusing mostly on, on recognizing your, your so called Buddha nature either like the way that your mind inherently is. Yeah. That's similarly disgust in the psychedelic community. Like what's the point in having these experiences if you can't bring back the revelations and enhance your actual here and now life. Sure. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          02:45:18       Really important. And then when it is integrated, like I definitely want to flush this out just a little bit more so people can get the sense of that yes, they're really their difficulties and their beautiful, vast, spacious moments. And then at the same time, and even if you don't have any beautiful Spanish, I'd like vast spacious moments. Even this moment in itself as you're sitting here can be beautiful. We've all touched into that. You know, so it's like it, there's a sense that when it's a wearing out, that's how I describe it. It's a wearing out process of a smaller sense of who we are. And that integration process is not always easy. And yet as it happens overall and over the long run, we are very, very, very beautiful people. You know, like there's that capacity to be

Speaker 4:          02:46:09       extremely powerful, extremely beautiful and connected, really connected with each other. Um, and that's, that's what inspires me to talk about all of this.

Speaker 6:          02:46:19       So you, in a sense, you guys are kind of Buddhist evangelists. That's part of what you're doing. Like in, in the podcast you sort of explaining or expressing, how has this enhanced your life?

Speaker 4:          02:46:33       This is one way. It's, yeah, it's one, it's one way to do it. I mean we're, we're not evangelists in the, in the sort of like missionary sense. I think we're evangelist in the sense that, you know, we think there's value here for some people, for some of the time that are inclined toward this or find it attractive. And if they do, like we have, you know, it's useful to be able to connect with other folks who've, who've done it and who in some sense can, you know, can be there with you. One of our, uh, one of our mentors said, you know, the role of a teacher is to be just a little less afraid than the student. Um, doesn't mean they're like, have it completely figured out. It just means they have a little bit less fear of what's happening. So I think it's useful to connect with people like that.

Speaker 4:          02:47:17       If you find you're attracted to something like that. Like if you're in to psychedelics, um, we've, we've explored psychedelics, you know, it's useful to go work with people who know a bit about it and who can like, um, not freak out if you have a bad trip or if you start losing your, your mind, you know, that can like extend their stability to you so that you can actually go through that process and learn from it. And in the end, like have an empowering experience of it. Uh, or at least in an empowering like interpretation of what happened. Um, and instead of just feeling like, oh my God, let reality sucks and like, I'm just going to be depressed and, you know, kind of crawl into a hole. Um, so I think, you know, in the same way, you know, for us, we just want to create a space where people can, um, you know, practice together like, like they've been doing for thousands of years, sitting in exploring their minds in a, in a collective,

Speaker 6:          02:48:08       well, I think you two are the comments people I've ever had in the podcast. This has been like the calmest podcast ever. And, uh, I think, yeah, in that sense, you guys are excellent representations of the Buddhist lifestyle, right? Cause that's what it's all about, right? Being at peace, sometimes being chilled sometimes, unless you're a Dharma punk, unless it, unless you're driving up the four oh five, five o'clock, that'll do it to you.
