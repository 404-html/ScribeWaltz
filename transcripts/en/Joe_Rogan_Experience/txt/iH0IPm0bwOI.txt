Thanks for having me here. Do I do love how you're wearing sunglasses inside? I'm going to do it for you. You don't have this slight shift. Black people only be able to do it. I want to rock that. Yeah. Why? Why can they do it? So you're broadcasting right now, right? Aren't we? So as we're broadcasting does not show up on ustream. Yeah, for me, I don't dare you. Let's try it again. Might be a little slow today. Ustream, is it blogging? We have a problem. There we go. Good. Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:00:43       Yep, we're good. Okay. So it was a, it was a total false alarm. Ladies and gentlemen, we have sunglasses on. Why? Because Sam triple, he showed up with sunglasses and the adult respect. I'm going to follow suit. Let's do it. I've never done a show with sunglasses on. Let's do it well. So what is it about black? Oh, before we even get started and we knew I needed to get a new one at these flashlights. By the way, Joe. Uh, I think I'm using my fucking the shit out of yours. I don't know if I'm not cleaning it well enough. This is the one I fucked. So you don't want to touch this one. We really fucked. That doesn't feel real. I think it's a computer technology to really fuck that. Fuck the Shit Outta my cat. Wants to get out man. But I let my cat out too.

Speaker 1:          00:01:33       While you were up. There's too many people in there. She's freaking out here. That's how we roll. Ladies and gentlemen. Some people that work out of a professional studio in Hollywood. Me, I got computers that are always on. I got a cat that wants to get out of my office. She does too. Girl. Don't insult their brother. That's before we get started. Doctor fucked one of these. I'll get to know a bunch of dogs. You ever on these dude? It's, of course you'd beat off. We all do. When you know dies with functional army and, and Dick's attached. We all beat off and this is way better than beating. Really? Yes, it's way better. We are actually sponsored by them, but even if I wasn't sponsored by them, I would tell you to fuck this thing. Are you telling me that they're better enough? My hand way better, way better because your hand, you always this, you're getting, oh, you're still getting like a signal from your Dick, but your hand signal from your hand that you're holding a dick.

Speaker 1:          00:02:33       You know what I'm saying? It's like you're doing it to yourself and even though you know exactly what you like, you know you're not gonna. Get the same feeling as if someone else was doing it to you or if you're actually fucking something that's amazing. This is the next best thing to having sex. I'm telling you, dude, it's the best masturbation device for the male ever created. It feels like you're fucking law upkeep though, Dude. You squirt some lube in it. You fuck it. You shoot your load, you uncork the bottom. This disgusting Snot ball of shame comes out like the spit valve and the trumpet. Dump your load out. Then you stick this in the faucet, clean the fucking shit so you don't pull. Don't pull the fish out of the bucket at all. You can. I do. I pull the fish out of the bucket anyway with Brian logins or Japanese Americans got dammit where I'm like, yeah, but by the way, what Brian means by pull the fish out of the bucket.

Speaker 1:          00:03:21       This is what Brian means. This is his patented move. He says that this. She just hooked that up to the back of your faucet, or are you good? It's a very controversial thing. This flashlight. It's a very controversial subject. Sex Toys and I don't think it should be. I think fucking dumb. It's a biological maintenance thing, you know? That's what masturbation, as you know, people think about it somehow or another, still like for something dirty to it like that. This, you know, rubber thing that you stick your Dick in because somehow or another this would be bad. You know, what sucks about that is when you have your married friends over for a nice drink or two and it's laying around and you accidentally leave it in the bathroom and not only do you leave it in the bathroom with like with the lid open, so it's just this pussy while he's taking a Piss, there was like a pubic hair on it of course.

Speaker 1:          00:04:05       And he came out and didn't say a word and then I went to the bathroom a couple minutes later. I'm like, oh, he didn't even say anything, you know, like going to like keep it to himself. Like don't maybe just assumes you're afraid. Maybe hit it, but it wouldn't tell you about him being married though. Huh? What? You know, because he was just like, you know, he's not, he's not. He's not like fucking fake pussies. Are you wearing sunglasses? Those are glasses. No glasses. I've been using the Internet too much lately, so my eyes are fucking killing me. Dude. You're cooking your eyes. Did last three days. I've done nothing but surf. The Internet on balls are getting. Not, they're not bad. I can still read, but they're not as good that I can definitely see a deterioration, but I'm just assuming that's a part of the aging process.

Speaker 1:          00:04:42       I've been on youtube constantly watching pro wrestling, nonstop food, Hulk Hogan versus the ultimate warrior. I was like, I watched that. I was getting really. You watch just because I got this right. Let's talk about that before we even say anything more. Sam. He has a fantastic show tomorrow night at the Hollywood improv. If you've never seen the Sam triply naughty show. It's not just stand up comics where he gets a bunch of, you know, really the best comics are buddies from La will go up and perform. I've done a show after the show last month, right? Yeah. He was murdered a Heckler, so it was so much fun. It's such a fun what it is though. It's not just stand up comedy, stand up comedy, but it's a variety. He's got like a variety show going on. He has like a little game shows going on. It shows video porn stars.

Speaker 1:          00:05:30       That's the main thing they get this week. You have Dana, don't you have Dana d ironman and Joanne Angel. That's great, and he does this show. It's like a comedy variety show. Porno stars. They do question and answer and Trivia type shit. It's really fucking hilarious stuff and it's a fun evening. It's not just like a comedy show, which I love comedy, but I liked that you're mixing it up. You got comedy, you've got a bunch of variety. It really feels like a vegas show and that's what I said when when I first saw it, I was, you know, someone should recognize that and put this fucking thing in Vegas because I know you've put a lot of time and effort into it. It's really a fun show to watch. Yeah, I look forward to that. My favorite part of the show is telling clean comic. Say, can't do it.

Speaker 1:          00:06:09       I'm sorry you were cleaned. Can't use just like porn. You what you're doing, man. It's, it's. You're creating this really fun party atmosphere. You know, that's what your show is. It's not just a comedy show. It's like a comedy show, but all this stuff that's happened, it's all fun and silly and it's like a great move. If you want to get a check. Horny, right. Your show is all about fucking. Your standup is about fucking. The show's all about fucking your porn stars up. Everybody's having a great time. So by the end of the night, if you're the girl you brought, if you, you know, if you picked her correctly when you're bringing it to the show, she's going associate having fun with fucking. She had fun with you. I just want to throw them Pavlov's shit. Some type shit son. I'm saying that's actually my. My crowd is more of a large part is women.

Speaker 1:          00:06:55       Yeah. Oh, there was a lot of chicks when we were there. Yeah. You have a lot of women that come. It's because it's fun, man. It's a fun show and again, girls I think really loved those like weekly, monthly type shows. You remember when before I'm a steel panther became big. Weren't they a metal shop? Is it the same band? I don't know if it's the same band or not because I just got into them when you showed me and we went to Vegas. Dude, how much fucking fun was that? No, it was awesome. It's more than just a music show. It's like, it's like when Steel Panther, they do like, uh, it's, you know, it's like, it really rekindled these eighties bands that dude does like the best fucking Ozzie impression that and the really good musicians, you know. So the music is tight, you know, it's good man.

Speaker 1:          00:07:36       We're just saying we saw him in Vegas at the House of Blues. We're going to see him again because I think they're on after me on July second. I think they're playing the second and the third. I'm not, I'm not sure, but I think they are. Um, but they, they were on after it. Was that, that or was it after the UFC was the next day? I don't know. I can't remember the next day. It was after the UFC. So we came down and we watched it. I think it was a pretty late show, but it's fucking awesome. It was metal. Copper, a steel panther ruined one of my favorite gigs in a pub. There was this place called moon doggies and every time I did it I always got legs like weird, weird lays too, like it was awesome. And then Steel Panther, one of them, they started doing it on the same night and then went away.

Speaker 1:          00:08:19       But dude, I mean we're chicks chicks who blue cows and stuff like that and like I'm like, that's a female ad blue an animal. That's all I know. And I'm like, check a balloon animal. Really? Would you like for a video? Just for fun. She balloon animal for fun. How do you, how'd you find out about this? She told me. Wow. That doesn't mean you don't really feel like you scored with that. That girl's willing to suck our cows. Dick. Yeah, but she's willing to do that. What? What will she let me do? She'll let you do what you did. You pretty much have full game on that. Yeah, but you don't feel like you accomplished anything. You feel like, wow, this is the lowest hanging fruit ever right now. Let's check flux animals. They can even talk, you'll start thinking about it and like Lysol on your Dick and this is, isn't there a certain thing like that, like, you know, when I talk about in my act about child molesters that you have to kill him because you can't really bounce back from that.

Speaker 1:          00:09:09       Yeah. It's a very funny joke. When we think about that with, with chicks, there's a certain amount of things that a chick can't do, you know, in her past where you can just accept that she grew from that and moved on. You know, like, like the conversation comes up about like would you be able to date a porn star or would you be able to date a prostitute? Oh, that would be the craziest one. Right? What if there was a girl who is a high end prostitute and she felt really bad about it, but she did it for like a year and then she quit, but she was the most awesome chick you ever met. The back of your head is going to be gone, but shit. I mean, I know I fucked up. I've made mistakes. I'm no fucking perfect person, but God damn you were a hooker.

Speaker 1:          00:09:47       Fuck. You know, it's like you would have to be incredibly open minded to like watching their girl get bone. But the problem with that, those guys are all fucked up, man. Those guys are just as fucked up. They're the type of people that don't take it in the ass if given the opportunity. One of those, I don't want to say that they're fucked up. They could just be crazy swingers. But with the people that are fucked up or the cuckold guys, the guys who like want guys to fuck the girl in front of the uh. Yeah. And like, and like embarrass them and like, do you, have you ever met one of these people or do you think that was just involved in Orange County? Like guys who pay like large black guys. I saw a picture online, I dunno, maybe Stan hope send it to me.

Speaker 1:          00:10:26       Somebody sent it to me. Somebody fucked up, send it to me and it's a this fucking guy and this girl together and the man is sucking this guy's Dick in front of the girl. The black eyes making this man suck his dick and then he's gonna fuck the white girl and he's wearing a suit and it's one of the most disturbing pictures. It's just something so primal and disturbing. That's a broken dude. Any dude who like wants to suck his dick and then once the girl to once he's not even get. He wants to be humiliated by this guy. He wants to fuck his girl in front of them. Then they. A lot of times they come in the guy's mouth.

Speaker 1:          00:11:02       Can you imagine? How much does that guy own you? He fucked your wife and then came in your mouth. Oh my God. You know, if you found out a chick used to do that, you know what I'm saying? Well, I dated this guy. He was crazy. He used to have black guys come over and fuck me in front of him and he would suck the black guy's Dick. I was so uncomfortable. I really wasn't into it, but he was into it, so we kept doing it and caught. I'm so glad I got over that. You'd be like, what the fuck happened? Wait a minute, didn't to remember with the white guy sucked the black guys deck. Then the black guy fucked you and then the black guy came in the white guy's mouth check please. Right? We snowballed 20 times back and forth and seeing too much hooker.

Speaker 1:          00:11:41       Too much. My dear. You've got too much life experience. I cannot handle that. That's where I tap it. But isn't there something about like having your getting your check to do filthy shit that's like, it's almost like a point, but then you kind of go, this is a girl and this girl, this girl I love. Why am I making her do it? What's even worse is when he wants you to do a tour, they want to be humiliated. You hear about girls like that want to be hit. I want to be choking. Thing is what gets me. I dated a chick. I want to get. It was uncomfortable. Scary. You don't want associate rape with sexuality, with you know, with. I mean, you know, the girl obviously knows she can trust you. The girl. I mean chicks are into it. Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying you shouldn't do it.

Speaker 1:          00:12:23       Do whatever the fuck you want. I think as a man though, the last thing you want to do is associate like aggressive violence with sexuality. I don't want to connect those two in my head because I know people get connected with things. You know, you get like fetishes come from like, I used to have a foot fetish because I dated this girl who was really her feet. Yeah. She was really into her feet and she had like, you know, cute feet. She just was really into him though and she will like rub her feet on my deck and shit like that. Crazy. But you know, and she would try to, to like a jerk me off of her feet. She was afraid. She was afraid. I just met somebody that like that. She was a freak. But this was when I was really young. I was like 16, 17 and I was like one of my first girlfriends.

Speaker 1:          00:13:00       So I had this foot thing for awhile. You know, you connect, you connect that with sexuality. I think it's weird. You get into connect. Yeah, maybe that's weird, but it wasn't like I was only in feet, like I just thought I liked girls were pretty feet. But you didn't see her feet and then like Papa Boehner did you? No, no, no, but I thought I've found them attractive to found the whole package attractive and the fact that she was really into it. So you don't have a foot fetish now? No, I don't like them to be gross, but no, I don't have a foot fetish. You take care of your feet, see my nails, but it's just so it doesn't scratch people and you just never get your feet done or anything like that. The Fuck Outta here. Sunday said, look what you're looking at. What are you taking? Anybody to be fucking cleaning my toe.

Speaker 1:          00:13:41       No, but once you have a job I ever had. Have you ever had it done there? No, I don't want to do it once I said the same shit. What's so special about getting your nail Polish feels good and it feels clean and once you're done you're just like, wow, I feel like this has been a feet. You Lazy. Fuck, wash washcloth and stuff, so it's like you're wiping. They brought me the one to get my feet down. One time I swear to God, I walked in the all the Asian ladies look at me and then they run to the back of the room behind this door and you can just hear them arguing and then wants to do. Nobody wants Armenian walk through and they're like, that's a long day. I saw one of those old guys at starbucks the other day that had like the sandals, but his toenails were all super yellow and like huge, like curling up and then he had like all those like scabby things all over his feet.

Speaker 1:          00:14:32       Like it was like drying skin and stuff. Trim mine mostly out of courtesy for guys that Jujitsu. Right. Because it sounds gross but. And Gay too. But you scratched us with your toenails and Jujitsu all the time. I got scratched by fingernails and toenails, so I always keep my shit really, really, really short. But there's guys that don't. Man. Sometimes you're rolling with God. You looked down at their feet and like the wolf man right now and they're scrambles and in scrambles. People push and they push off their feet and they can claw you up, man. What their toenails. Now we're going to try to get your back and they're trying to get those hooks in there, trying to dig the hooks to get butterfly hooks on you. They could fuck you up with their toes, man. They can cut your shit up. Is that why you haven't heard from all the scratch marks on your face? Joe On furry son. I'm trying to suck on this beard son Yo. But going back to what you're talking about is a bit weird fetishes. Don't you think that people should just embrace what they are and trying to find. All was saying too that I was saying,

Speaker 2:          00:15:28       me personally, I don't think. I mean this is just an opinion. I don't think it's good to connect violence and sex. You know, I connected feet with sex for awhile because of this freaky girl that had did it. That's another wrong with that. No one's getting hurt. If you connect violence when sex and then you get with somebody that you'd like and maybe she isn't into that shit, you know, maybe. I mean, let's be honest,

Speaker 1:          00:15:47       the violent sexual relationships really don't have a lot of fucking shelf life. She gotta assume you're going to have another girlfriend after this one that wants you to choke her and brutalize macro in the head. How long are you going to stay with her? Right. You know, we're going to have kids and then like involve them into the whole man. Obviously

Speaker 2:          00:16:04       people adapt and change and evolve. But it's just, there's something about that. There's something about violence like attacking and sex. There's one thing about fucking someone hard, but it's another thing about, you know, when it, when it becomes some sort of like a sort of a rape thing, like a rape fantasy,

Speaker 1:          00:16:22       some weird shit about rape fantasies. That is weird. But you know, it's like I do a joke about that Auto Rocca fixation. It's like my, you know, my whole thing is get a spotter. You know what I'm saying? Like get a buddy. No. Sit there when you hang yourself. And you're whacking it and when your eyes roll, they lift you up for that. Do you know what I'm saying? But because they're so scared of putting it out there that they, they hide hustling, you know? It would be a very good point. You mean look, think about all the shit

Speaker 2:          00:16:50       priest do. Right? And, and somehow, you know, forgive themselves for it or justify it. There was that one priest that Baptist minister, very famous guy, obviously they're not the same as priests, but who he died with a black dildo up his ass in a wet suit hanging because he did the auto erotic association thing. Just think of all the shit that that guy's willing to justify, you know, if you. I mean, not really. That's actually a bad example because I said he was a bishop, but hopefully they'll catch a priest doing the exact same thing and this will make sense. But this poor guy couldn't just tell people, hey, I got this crazy thing I like to do. Man, that's really fucked up. I'm in the weird. I don't want you to see it, but I'm afraid I'm gonna die.

Speaker 1:          00:17:33       Yeah. So coming to watch me beat up, just sit there and spot it should be an iphone app where you like, you hit start and if you don't like put in a code in like three minutes or something like that. It caused nine slash 11 automatically so you can choke yourself or whack off on what is it about people that just trip certain things

Speaker 3:          00:17:50       like that. Like you know, like they'll get into just whatever weird fetish at tying people up and gagging. Um, and you remember our pal that used to like to beat his check and she still liked to get whipped. Remember that he used to whip her. Who? Mr D dot. Do you remember that? You don't remember that? We can't. We can't say who because he dated someone famous. All right, we'll talk later. We'll talk off. There were no snitches. Folks. Snitches get stitches. I gave it to them and cold. He don't even know who the fuck I'm talking about. I'm confused, right? We'll forget about it. But what's head dance? Just let's just try to figure out what the fuck it is. I mean, I know that my thing with feet was because I dated a girl is freaky with her feet.

Speaker 4:          00:18:30       I have a boob thing. Definitely, you know, every guy is gonna know. But, but like, like I always joke older girls were the vagina's. That's what I'm doing. I, I get blinded by headlights like nonstop. Hey, I found that we all do. I know, but that's what I'm saying. Basic Man on the face and ass man. You know,

Speaker 3:          00:18:50       there's two totally different things when it comes to, uh, with breast sexuality, what would make some sexual. There's natural tits where you have conflict is a natural natural draw, but it's just purely sexual. But there's a different draw with fake tits, with fake tits. There's still a draw and you feel stupid for being drawn to these stupid things because you know that they're really just bags of water underneath the skin and it's not the same draw from real tits. But there's something, a little extra dirty about the fake, a little extra turn you on a bit because you know this, she's the, she wants so bad. She was like, I want to make sure, you know, I really like that you're right. And they could say that it's like that. They're just trying to look attractive and all that good. But what does that mean?

Speaker 3:          00:19:32       You want to look like somebody wants to fuck you. You want people to really want to fuck you. I would agree. Unless it's one of those like, no, I just got to be because of their really droopy, you know? But for the most part, yeah, I will. Look, there's nothing wrong with getting breast implants if you want to do it wrong. Don't get me wrong. If I was a girl, I'd probably have, um, if I had a small boobs, I'll get a boob job. Fuck it. Why not? How about breastfeeding? I think that's when girls is give up because it hurts too much because that's the only thing I can think of. I did a girl a long time ago. She had, she was just born with giant ones. She had a breast reduction before I met her. She was so happy though because for her, like her back used to fucking killer. She had these giant ease, a natural ease. Wow.

Speaker 4:          00:20:09       I actually have a family member I've been in. I've said that novela was right. I have a friend that, uh, she's born with a gigantic cod. Is Bruce breast or lightest or whatever it's called. Where is your breast? Just art. Retardedly. They're retarded bread. Just a gift from God. No, no. I mean these aren't even real breast. These look like a fucking a category, you know, it looks like a worm or was it like the old lady breasts where it's like down at their gut. And if you look at this person, you're like, wow, that person's fat. But if you knew it was just like, hey, lift the blue up here. No, actually I'm fine. Oh Wow. They won't let her operate. She's only like 18 and they won't let her operate because they'd say you have to lose 30 pounds because this is a really serious, like a procedure, procedures and the, I guess you can't be overweight at all. You have to be really healthy and she won't do it. So now this poor girl is just, wow, she's so lazy. She won't lose 30 pounds. What a lazy bitch. She know what someone needs to do something with your microphone. You're plugging in like how heavy can you be back in tighter or something?

Speaker 5:          00:21:15       Everybody's in good shape. I didn't do anything, so. No, no.

Speaker 4:          00:21:28       Well Gentlemen, we got kinks to it wouldn't turn me way down. Well, I'm trying to get rid of that. That like there's like a buzz in it. So Rogan, what the fuck? Tripling.

Speaker 6:          00:21:38       I'll tell the story of a you and me and a heckler. I don't remember that one. That was a funny one. A whenever you want. I don't know. It's the greatest heckle kill of all time. I was doing a Gig in Phoenix, Arizona. Friend of mine at a bar and eat. Whenever I came in town he'd throw a standup show. So I went down to stand up, uh, my aunt who's no longer with us, but she finally got to come see me and she was like 80 at the time. So she came down. My whole family's there. I'm onstage and I'm doing a joke about how I got my ass kicked by my girlfriend. I got a scar right here from when she put me in the hospital, you know, I got stitches and all that stuff and I was talking about that and I dropped my punch and all of a sudden I hear jokes.

Speaker 6:          00:22:22       I'm like, what? She's like, yeah. I'm like, oh, what do you. Oh, who? And I look and there's this really hot chick with this huge goon. She was sitting on his lap and I'm like, what are you talking about, lady? She goes, that's not your joke. That's Joe Rogan's joke. You didn't write that you fucking stole it from. I go, no, Joe Rogan's my friend. He doesn't have that joke. No, it's his fucking joke. I just heard him do it. You're a fucking joke thief. I go, well, how about this? How about I called Joe and he'll tell you it's not his job. She goes, good, do it, but you won't because you're a fucking joke thief. I'm like, I'm on stage, man. Please let this have a good ending. So, uh, so I'm like, okay, I'm going to call them, but we got to make a deal.

Speaker 6:          00:23:07       If he says it's his joke, I'll quit comedy now if he says it's not his joke, you have to come up here and let this guy in the front row lick your tits. And she's like, okay, but you're not going to make call your fucking joke thief. So I called Joe and uh, usually Joe, we'll get back to me the next day or something like that that I'm like, Oh man, he's not going to answer the phone. So I call him. I leave a message and I'm like, Joe, this triply, dude, I need you to call me right now. I'm onstage, call me and I hang up. I'm like, ah, you didn't answer. And she's like, of course he didn't answer because you're a fucking joke thief. I go, it's like Friday night ladies probably doing sub that all of a sudden my phone rings act of God. I don't know what it is. Awesome. It's fucking Rogan. And I'm like, but then you have a tea and tea and it drops in the union.

Speaker 6:          00:23:55       I'm like, Rogan, what's up? He said, what's up? Tripling? What the fuck are you doing? I go, I'm doing stand up. He goes, you're on stage right now. I'm like, yeah, I go, do you do joke about getting your ass kicked by your girlfriend? And well, you know, Joe, he doesn't get his ass kicked by anybody, so it's not happening. He's like, no, I don't. I'm like, okay, you need to tell this guy this story. So, um, and I tell them that, you know, this girl accused me of stealing his joke, so I bring this guy on stage. It's like I might confirm it's Rogan and then repeat what he says. Oh, it's Rogan Joe Rogan. Joe Rogan. No, he doesn't do a joke like that. He's never done a joke like that. And uh, Sam Tripoli doesn't have to steal joke because he's a funny motherfucker. Fuck you bitch.

Speaker 6:          00:24:36       And the whole place just goes, man. Did you record this? Do you have a red band? No, I think one guy record, I've always asked them, it was lost in the ecosphere. So the whole place goes nuts. I can't follow that. So I just am like, Hey rogen, thank you so much. I got to take care of some business. I hang up, I go, okay, it's time to pay the toll to the troll. Come up with this guy on your tits. And she's like, no, I ain't going to fucking do it. And the whole place booze her right now. So I'm like, oh, I can't. I tried one joke. I can't follow that. It's the greatest heck kill of all time. So I'm like, okay, that's great. Thank you guys so much. Standing. Oh, I'm not lying to you. Every chick in the place runs up to this chick and starts fucking laying into her.

Speaker 6:          00:25:21       You're a fucking bitch. You shouldn't have fucking done that. You made a deal. You should gun up there. Let him lick your tits. Fucking all of a sudden I see this chick and her goon boyfriend running out of the bar because they're getting chased out by checks. That is awesome. And I wish you had the club was this. It was a bark a called. Oh, what was the name of the bar? I can't even remember. Los Angeles knows in Phoenix. He was in Hollywood. I was in Phoenix. This chick got bitch slapped in the six. Oh, two, three, two, three. That is beautiful. Isn't it crazy? You can do that today, dude. That's a. that's one. A big one. That would have been such a great youtube video. These clubs, or if they were smart, they'd be like, look, we're always going to record you. If something fucking crazy happens, uh, you know, we're going to put it on our youtube page.

Speaker 6:          00:26:07       We don't, I don't like hecklers. I really wish. Every show is just fun. Nobody had a good time, but God damn interacting with those fucking retards sometimes makes for some fun shit. Fuck, you know. Have you ever thought about why they heckle? Yeah, I mean, there's a whole bunch of reasons for sure. They're all fucked up in the head. No one, no one heckles. It's a cool person. It's not what you would do. I think girls heckled because they're either attracted to you or they. They're mad at someone else's. The center of attention. There could be that or you could be offensive to them and they feel like they have the need to shut you up or they, they can stop you. I've had that. I've experienced that before where I felt

Speaker 2:          00:26:44       like, uh, like what I was saying, like a girl didn't agree with what I was saying and she just was not going to hear it. She couldn't hear it and she had a yell shit out. I've had that happen before where they just, you could tell they just can't take it. It's just like they're just too much a control freak or something. But you know, the bottom line is I've seen a lot of things that I didn't enjoy, you know, but I just left, you know, that's the whole thing. It's like I hate comment cards. Nothing wrong with that man. You know, you want to know a bunch of people thought that guy socked, you know, if people pay them in cards or just like mailing lists there. That's pretty much the club. Trying to get your information to advertise for it is boats also to get feedback.

Speaker 2:          00:27:19       They read, they read the feedback. Then I think there's some good things to it because of a bunch of people got turned off to a show, you know, they should know. I mean, look, you've got to find your own fucking audience, man. And until people knew what I did, there was a lot of shows that I did were a lot of people get offended, you know, people that came to see like the fear factor guy or some guy from television that they thought was cute and I'm talking about all kinds of crazy shit that they don't. They don't necessarily want to hear about it, you know? So I, I totally understand the whole feedback system, man.

Speaker 2:          00:27:51       I'm a yelp elite. I get into the best thing about the internet is all the criticism that you get. It seems to. It seems like it's not, but it is because some of it is good. Some of it is very constructive. Even if they're douchey about it. It's like, think about how you would criticize something anonymously if you were to totally anonymous and you weren't a performer. You know, when you saw something like it fucking sucked donkey text. This guy blows, he's got this ridiculous outlook on life. It's not well thought out at all. I don't want to hear him making his dumb point, you know, that's what you'd say if you were totally anonymous and that's what they're going to say two, but guess what, man, that's the real reaction to you and it may be valid and it may not be. They might be just fucking idiots who look for negative shit and everything and they can't look at anything in a positive way and they could be jealous and they could have all sorts of other issues where they don't like other men having success or anybody having success because they're unhappy if that's possible too.

Speaker 2:          00:28:41       But it's also possible they got some good points, man. You know, I think it's real hard for us as, as comedians performance to totally objective. Look at your shit. You know, sometimes you don't want to. Sometimes you don't want to edit your material or edit your writing or you don't want to like go back on it and improve it again and improve it again and try to figure out like, what's wrong with it? You know, sometimes you get lazy, but people all that shit on Youtube comments and message boards, comments, that's all good for you, man. I really believe that that's the best thing for your psyche to be able to, to, to really see things objective. Lee. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:29:14       The biggest thing I get on youtube is that drives me crazy is when people call me racist, I just can't stand it because I'm really not. I just can't, can't even read that shit. Like you can't read anybody on the, on, on the Internet because 90 percent of them are people that. It might be just somebody you know fucking with you. It might just be an interesting.

Speaker 2:          00:29:34       We've got a friend. Let me tell this before you go. We had a friend who broke up with a girl and she got on every one of his youtube videos

Speaker 1:          00:29:42       and would write nasty fucking comments about them. She created like a whole profile just to fuck with them and that's what it is and it easily or it's just one obsessed person that's making multiple accounts to make it seem like there's all these people flocking to you. That happens. A lot of people that think you suck. I'm saying we know somebody that does that. It does happen occasionally, but I think that's not really worth looking at. I think you know, you look at like, what's the tone? What are they saying? Are they just being retarded? But is it valid? There's something to it. Yeah. I like it because it doesn't leave it. I'll leave like he has a valid point. Made the comment if it's just some stupid ass, makes no sense. Some of you just want attention to. They just want attention. They just want to react to that 15 year olds on the computer.

Speaker 1:          00:30:25       Then you watch the documentary with Carlos Mencia. Dude, I showed it to you son. No, I was saying I haven't seen it yet. Got to see the uh, no, actually I don't care. I'll tell you exactly what it is on youtube we heard about this. They did a documentary called I am comic and in the comic documentary they talk to them and see where he just youtube look for Youtube. Carlos Mendez he admits to stealing. He's just so he doesn't admit it, but he explains what everyone's always accused him of. I mean, he actually, like, he actually like Jay tries to justify it by saying that it's like sampling. I actually wouldn't care about this at all. So after you showed it to me, it really was amazing. It was way more than I could ever imagine he would ever do. Yeah. I would have thought that it would have been some sort of thinly veiled joke or that, you know, he would, you know, sort of like come up with some sort of a justification, you know, people are jealous or something and, or just half asset, but this is like, you just flat out and that's it, man.

Speaker 1:          00:31:23       You just listened to it. Check, check this. Hold on. Let me turn down all these volume. You're going to freak out because it's just so weird. I was kind of actually starting to feel really bad for him lately because this is his twitter has been really depressing and stuff, but this, this is scary. I felt bad for him after the Marin podcasts. Yeah, well that was hard for him. I'm sure when Steve Trevino and Barcelona and all those guys got up, I start, I actually sit on my twitter, you know, if you ever want to get ice cream, I'm here for you and I told you, dude, he's got a fucking poison your ice cream. Like the one guy ruined his life. Here's the clip.

Speaker 7:          00:32:02       A lot of people out there. Why did the interview Carlos, Carlos, Carlos, you can. We know that listened to me and look at me when I tell you this with all honesty, if you think that I still joke like, yeah, you're right. We're trying to fucking steal jewelry out of your fucking mind. When I come to a comedy club, you better one bitch. You better get the forecast stage because if anything even remotely funny, I'm going to make it mine and Oh, I'm going to do it. Shouldn't Mexican in the front. I'm like a rapper. Sampled and make it my own. What does it really my friend, what it sounds like, my kind of like somebody else's.

Speaker 1:          00:32:48       That's almost like watching a man implode. There's something about seeing that because what he's trying to do and make it look like, you know, like he's a bad ass and he doesn't give a fuck sort of like, you know, like I rob people, like a rapper would say it was the only thing he could do. I think he needs to do this. I think he needs to finally come clean with it because that's the only way, unless you want us to live the next 30 years being the joke like, oh, watch out for that guy. You know? I think he just had to do this. Trying to justify it. He's trying to justify it. I mean he's trying to actually figure out a way where it could be. Okay. Did you notice how he kept saying, y'all had this amazing memory? I have this amazing memory, and then they're like, well, when you did this is one time to kind of go up A. I can't remember that. Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:33:28       Remember that. You know, how about the dude doesn't have anything written down. How crazy is that as a comic? Let me tell you something, man. There's, there's a bunch of parts to being a comic like you, you know, this can't stand up. Comedy is not just your ideas. It's how you get those ideas out and that needs honing and you'll take these ideas. You'll have an idea for a bit or an idea for something. I write everything out. I write out what I think about something. I write out what I think about a subject just so I know like what my real thoughts and points are and then once I do that, then I start dissecting it. Okay. What's funny about this, when we get to the meat of this, I know what I feel about this. No, let me get to the meat of this.

Speaker 2:          00:34:05       Now let me get on stage and let me figure out what's the best way to do this. Am I going to introduce this part of the idea first? Am I going to go right into the punchline right away so it's totally unexpected, but right to the meat of the, the joke and then like build onto the thing once I've already told them what's happening, build onto it afterwards and make it just more ridiculous. Like how am I gonna approach this? Like there's a, there's a lot of craft to it, man. You know, Alibaba, that invites involves writing shit. I mean you can sort of remember it, you know, I've gone through periods of time where I had a bunch of bits that they just sort of came up on stage, you know, like they were attached to other bits and then they branched out, became bits of their own.

Speaker 2:          00:34:40       But I never actually wrote them down. I just knew how to do them from doing a monster. And, but for the most part man, to create, to really give something, some time and some consideration, you've got to sit in front of a fucking piece of paper and think you know, you kinda right. And if you're doing standup and you're not writing, man, I kinda know. I kinda think that you're just, how is it, how are those even really truly your opinions? I mean your opinions are like all conglomerated with all the people around you, but you don't know what the opinion is until it's you by yourself. Your act is alive until it's. Yes. It's constantly evolving. Dude. I always say that. I always say that it's almost like A. I mean it's very pretentious sounding, but I say it's almost like a living, breathing philosophy, but I don't want to say philosophy because that sounds really fucking yoga. He and pull yourself, you know, it's not that it's a philosophy, but it's the way of looking at life. It's like this is my way of looking at this particular situation that's going on and this particular time and then once it's recorded it's like frozen and then it becomes like know part of you know

Speaker 3:          00:35:38       who, who your life was. You know, I mean that's. But that's really what it is. Right? So everything I do, I tried to turn into a joke at some point. Do you, how much time do you spend actually sitting in front of pieces of paper or computer writing here? I do a little different man. I mean I'll, I'll sit down and write, but I feel like I have to flow on stage, get going. I'll write it down. But literally man, I talked to myself all day. I just worked a bit worse a bit and like I'm driving. I'll be okay here. This is it. Okay. Tag Tag, tag cut down. And I don't want to work at too much. I just want to get on stage one time getting the natural part, right? Yeah. Yeah. And then just flow and see where it goes and just try to talk through it.

Speaker 3:          00:36:19       And isn't it funny how you got an idea and you write it out and you think that you're gonna say it one way, but then when you're on stage at the moment just tells you to say it a little different. And now little difference. Pam could make this fucking huge reaction to just a word. You can tweak a bit man or a pause or just to setting it up correctly. You know, there's such a craft to it, man. It's just something that you're always fucking with you. No, it's so satisfying. But for a lot of people it's so stressful. You know, I know a lot of dudes that eventually they want to get out and they want to do tv shows and shit like that because just doing the standup all the time, just relying only on the standup. It's just such a fucking wild ride, you know?

Speaker 3:          00:36:55       Yeah. They need like Louis C, k does it, man. He does it crazy, bro. He does a new special every year and then throws out all his material and starts fresh. That's strong. That's strong. It has a strong work ethic right there, man. You got to put in some serious work, you know? That's uh, that's, that's pretty impressive, man. That's a dude who's dedicated to comedy. Do you find yourself always been able to come up with some mat? Sometimes I go like a month without writing anything I like and I'm like, oh yeah, so go nuts. I'm like, dude, you know, what fixes that we'd, we'd fixes the shit out of that. You don't smoke weed though? I'm not. I quit pretty much drink too. You should. If you look at w, when did you stop drinking again about, uh, like two months ago after Canada attempt to believe through an them towels.

Speaker 3:          00:37:45       Then what's your addiction right now? What division do you got going on right now? Any. Well, I mean like a finger in, and this is, this is the way I think you should look at pot when it comes to comedy. Po is like a turbo charger for your imagination. Ideas that you have normally, they'll become much more expressive to go down different alleys. It's an enhancer for your mind. People don't appreciate how much of an enhancer it is because it's associated with silliness. It's associated with losers and just want to sit on the couch and eat munchies and it's associated with a bunch of dumb, Lazy Shit. But the reality is that the effect of marijuana is fucking magical. There's so much to it. There's so much creatively that happens to you when you're writing and you get high. These ideas just come flowing 300, 400 percent better than when you're sober and don't recognize can you kind of treated as an end theologian treated as something that's helping to enlighten you, treat it as something that you're gonna use as a tool as you just want to get fucked up and party.

Speaker 3:          00:38:44       Yeah, that's the fine line because if you're a guy who doesn't have the best self control and that's what most comics are, most of us are fucking crazy. The reason why we do comedy in the first place because we really couldn't do anything else. Otherwise we would've done something else because it beginning. It's so fucking hard and no one thinks they're going to make it. You literally have to have almost no options and the guys who do have options tend to go to those options. Yes, exactly. And even if even if you do have those options span and it's like you, a comic is going to blow shit off, there's just no way around that. Right? I mean, just the only way we got to be where we're at. You have to be fucking above rapper. Yeah. You gotta be at least fucked up. One starts at like rappers.

Speaker 3:          00:39:21       I mean those. They're so hard to wrangle, bro. You got to just fuck was my original thought. You thought I was smoking weed enhances everything. Especially music. Exactly. What I think you should do is just, if you want to try it at all, if you want to do it at all, treated as if you're going to go through and experience. Don't treat it as if you're going to get fucked up and party. That's how I do it. When I write, I treated it as if I'm ready to, I'm going to experience something. I'm going to go deeper into my mind and I'll say, oh, just get fucked up. Put them on. Do some writing, man. Now I say, all right, I'm getting ready to right here. I got these ideas. Now I'm going to, you know, get in touch with the spirit world. Man. Just thinks of it as a fucking tool to it.

Speaker 3:          00:39:57       If it didn't exist, okay, and if it wasn't illegal, it didn't have all these things attached to it, you would think that shit is magic. It makes fucking way better. It makes food taste better, it makes you nicer and it makes you way funnier. Way more creative. Way more honest. Like your shit resonates more when you're high. I don't think I can perform high dude. My head just try. I think some people are just, they're wired different because I understand being to stumbling on stage because I don't think when I'm. When I'm stoned I think about something and I obsess about something and like ideas and stuff, but I can't actually like my, like my okay, I know what you're saying, but the reason why you don't think that going on stage stone would be fun. It's because going on stage, it's not a comfortable part of your everyday life.

Speaker 3:          00:40:42       It's like you know how you can sit and edit stoned, you know, and you get high and then it makes you more creative and it's more fun. Well I don't like talking to people. Usually when I'm still in. Like if I, if I get stoned and talked to my mom, it's going to be worse than if I was now. You know what you mean? Totally. But for me, what it is, is just an experience thing. It's just like you got to get comfortable with the experience and when you've been doing comedy for like, I've been doing it 22 years almost. Yeah, that'd be 22 years in August. That's a long ass time, man. When you're doing it for that long, it really does become just like another thing you do in life. It doesn't, doesn't freak out. So when you get high it's like you just tune into that thing better. So I can just fucking connect to it better. No. When did you start smoking weed? Because I think when I first met you, you weren't a weed smoker? No, not at all. As a matter of fact, I thought it was for losers. And what, what, what made that change? I saw, I tried it.

Speaker 2:          00:41:33       Um, you know, Eddie Bravo is the dude who turned me onto it because Eddie and I were, we met at Jujitsu and we were going out to lunch or talking about some shit. And he's a smart dude. I was like, we had really similar philosophies on a lot of different things on, on politics and on the way the world works and like how strange everything is. Like a very curious, very similar point of view to mine, but he would talk about getting high all the time and doing, making this music and shit. And I was like, how the fuck is that good for you man? I was like, Pontus makes you fucking lazy. Like that's what I thought. And he's like, no, no, no. That's all propaganda. It's all, if you don't know what you're doing, if you smoke the wrong kind of weed, if you smoke too much, if you do it when you're drunk, you know, you associate all these negative things with it, just try it.

Speaker 2:          00:42:13       So I said, all right, fuck it. Come on, let's try it. And from that day, from that day getting high, I realized I'm like, Whoa, this is crazy. Here's this. There's a plant that gives you an altered state of consciousness that actually makes things seem more. You're more sensitive to things and it makes you more aware of. It feels like some weird like intelligence enhancer, it feels like it makes you. It makes you dopey, and the fact that sometimes you get so obsessed with one idea, you can't multitask at the same time. So if you get how to fucking, you know, how do you spell someone's name and your phone or if you can get some weird shit, you forget what you were talking about because there's just so much going on. It's such a flood and it's just the. The, the key to the experience to using it as to learning how to relax and learning how to get rid of all the shit that makes you paranoid.

Speaker 2:          00:43:00       Because when dudes get paranoid, when you freak out about shit, you should be freaking out about that. Whatever the fuck it is, you're freaking out about. When you. When you get high, that is something that you've put in the back of your head and you're avoiding and it's an issue that you need to resolve and once you do resolve those issues, once you don't have anything fucking with your head. Once you let come to terms with who you are in this life and and try to put it, put out good energy and you feel comfortable with it, then you can ride that bitch. Then when you get high you can fucking tune into it all so you can get really high and not be paranoid and instead of being paranoid, you learn how to like, let go and tune into some sort of a higher state of truth than what you're normally able to experience.

Speaker 2:          00:43:40       You can see things in a perspective that doesn't seem to be available to you in a sober state as much as you meditate, as much as you try to release. Even if I'm in an isolation tank, there's something about there's a connection that plant gives you to something else, you know, and I think we just, we have it categorized as something that's like silly and we have it categorized as something, you know, a man, we watched this movie, it was awesome. Which is totally true to you can do that, especially if you smoke like couch weed, but you can also smoke weed and and figure out the universe. I mean Carl Sagan used to smoke weed every day.

Speaker 6:          00:44:16       Why it is I think the propaganda that went along with the people who didn't want you thinking like that, you know, to a point with reefer madness and all that stuff. It's like when you get high or you do shrooms and all that stuff, you start seeing things differently.

Speaker 2:          00:44:29       Yeah. And you know, people will go Fulcan rogen and his bullshit part propaganda. Like what are you talking about bro? You're getting brand damage, you're focusing, you're losing your mind. You know the people who say that all of them don't smoke weed. It is just smoking weed. They don't give a fuck. People that bash iphones because they have iphones, apple, somebody put a thread up on the underground the other day, Tom lawler filthy tom law or though the fighter. I said, why should I tell me why I should buy a Mac? And you know, people like you, if you're gay, sell these dudes like get fucking upset at Max, you know, weird. There's so many retards out there. It Bro, there's so many retards and all of them just need. They needed to be raised better. All of them, all of them were raised by other retards.

Speaker 2:          00:45:15       And it's just a cycle to thin the herd. Don't want, you know, what we gotta do, we gotta figure out a way to fucking make people like develop and grow and evolve and catch the fuck up because these dumb asses, having kids, these people that are just their life is a fucking holy rack. The relationships are filled with fucking yelling and screaming and chaos and all sorts of dysfunctional bullshit and drugs and alcoholism and in hate and anger. And these kids grow up in that and then they're fucked. You know, they grew up in that. They get, they get poor programming when they're young. So they never figured out how to really see the world and healthy and loving way, you know, they're always need either always angry. There was always negative. Like that's how they're fucking programmed. And they're going to program kids just like them, unless something snaps them out of it, whether they get addicted to meditation and become a monk or getting into martial arts or you know, learn, learn how to do a fucking sport where you can get out of here wherever the fuck you are you're at and you know, and, and, and figure things out for yourself.

Speaker 2:          00:46:11       But you need to like really fucking rethink your whole world when you're raised like that for most people. That's so fucking hard. Yeah, the middle of nowhere. I think people are just like, they're just slowly dying. It's just like to go out there and learn about all this stuff takes effort and I just saw my chapter. People don't want to do that. They don't, they're too lazy and they want you to think the way they're thinking. Well, you couldn't do want you to think the way they're thinking. That's what they want. That's what being a right wing person is all about. That's what people who are nationalism internationalism, that's what it's all about. It's all about you thinking like we're all part of this one thing. Drink blue moon to fuck. Just still put your quick. There's the Christian diction who's booked on crystal ball juice.

Speaker 2:          00:46:51       Yeah. It's so low. Their idols crashes and Burns instead of being like, well, maybe we don't have. We don't see it right there. Like, I'll fucking get rid of him. And you guys pops up saying they see it. Right. It's crazy. Anybody you can't. We have to talk this fucking thing out. You can't say you have the answers. There's too many questions. It's impossible. It's too tricky. You never have crossed over and come back. You know. Most of them have never even had alternate experiences like psychedelic experiences that they can add to their model of the world. You know, there's altered states. It can be achieved by fucking plants on this that are growing here on this planet. Know if there really was God, do you think it would just leave things like that there. I mean if God, if there was a really, it was a god and he had a plan.

Speaker 2:          00:47:35       If you think that, then you really should believe in psychedelics because they're there for a fucking reason. God's not just going to put some shit that makes you have these beautiful, loving, positive, incredibly mind expanding experience. That's just a dumb coincidence. You know, that's just a dumb coincidence that that grows on cow shit. Like if you're religious, you should be into psychedelic experiences and if you into psychedelic experiences, the first thing you're going to say is no one knows. You can't know. There's no fucking way. There's no answers. We all have to try to figure out what's the best model of behavior for this life. What's the best way we can get by with the most positive energy? Because we don't know what the fuck am I believe in Karma. Yes. It's real. Fuck. Yeah. Fuck did I do. I totally believe in. It could be like, it might not happen today, tomorrow, a year from now, but it will come back.

Speaker 2:          00:48:25       Yes. Here's my take on Karma. I don't even think. I think even the way we think of Karma, we think of it selfishly, that we think, you know, I don't want to do bad things because I want, you know, good things come back to me. So I'm going to do good things. So the good thing come back to me. You know, we, I mean even the term Karma, like the way people use it up, that's Karma. See what happened to him. Karma. It's almost like self justifying, you know, I think the way to look at it is that you, and this is all shit that I like decided on after I had dmt trips, is that I think all the energy that you put out, so it's sort of your choice. It's sort of your choice to be positive and when you're positive, positive will resonate more positive.

Speaker 2:          00:49:07       It's, you put yourself in a, in a group of people, you put yourself in a, you know, a, a, a think group that are all like that. When you're positive and you're like a friendly, loving person, you're going to naturally have that kind of behavior from your friends. You're going to, they're going to feel like they can be that way with you and that's going to ripple out. And so all the people that are gonna be in your circle after awhile, we're all going to be like loving positive. Cool people and that's possible, man, we can all do that. We literally can all do that. It's just hard to do. You know, it's hard. It's hard to find cool people. It's hard to find people that you can, you can open up with and you'd be cool with it and you get to a point in your life where you can, can, you want them to be successful.

Speaker 2:          00:49:49       You want them to be happy, want great things for them, like literally want that for them as much as you would want it for you. You know, instead of thinking of Karma as like, you know, you do good thing. So do good things. Come back to you. It's more to me like your energy. We're all energy and when you, you resonate positive energy and when you push forth positive energy is fucking hippie and crystals and yoga beads as that sounds. I really think that shit is, is how the universe works. I think if you're a negative negative fucked up, Shit's going to happen. It's supposed to, you know, and I think a lot of the times when we have negative content, our life, you know, it's like, it's almost like we are. Life is a mathematical problem and some things will come up in your life.

Speaker 2:          00:50:30       Male, female, whatever. Job Boss, whatever the fuck it is. There's things that come up in your life that are absolutely negative and it's your job to figure out how the fuck to get past this part of the game. It's that simple. You don't just say, oh my fucking job sucks. There's not. My boss was a Douche, so I'm getting fucking ulcers because my boss is fucking always on my ass. I'm always nervous. No, that's. This is an intelligence test. Okay. You've, you've reached a problem. Yeah. It might be very difficult to solve this problem. You might have children. You might have obligations that you have to think, so this problem might take you a couple of years to solve, but it's your fucking job to solve this problem. Douche bag. It's not your job to go to the doctor and take a fucking pill, makes you loopy, and then you do go cocaine one night and shoot up a fucking movie theater. You know what I'm saying? I mean, you get your shit together, son. Get get your fucking shit together. This life is a test. It's all like little things that you come across in your life. You're going to fail, you're going to have mistakes, but that's all good. That's what they're supposed to be there for. Everything's energy, man. Yeah. I mean it sounds totally ridiculous. Tubes and tunnels as I believe and I believe it was tubes and tunnels.

Speaker 4:          00:51:35       Tron. Yeah. Tron, you see toy story three d, it was a dope. I love it. I hear it's awesome. That is probably the best movie ever to get as stoned as closest to. I'm having a heart attack. Get that stone. Go see toy story three. It's fucking crazy. I just. I know you might not. I love animated movies really well. Like did you like up dude? It was better than up and that's saying a lot because I love. Fuck. How great was up when your baked goods. You're going to love this. I saw the incredibles. Hi. It was so good. It was magical. Avatar high is the best movie in the world. You know what I. I'm waiting for it to come out blue, right? Like a better ray versions I haven't seen yet because they haven't seen it. I've seen it. I've seen it, but no, they released a stripped down blue ray and then they're going to release like an extended version blue. Right? Like in a couple months. And so I'm waiting. I'm not going to just go buy this frugal shopper. Well, I don't want to buy three versions of Avatar about him not winning the Oscar

Speaker 2:          00:52:36       gives a fuck man. Really? These are goofy jokes. The, the, the idea that you're, you're fucking, you have awards that you'd give to art. Who can, who the fuck is he to say what is good? There's shit that people like that I hate. You know, there's women that thought sex necessity to is the greatest movie in the history of the world. Would I have liked to? Probably not.

Speaker 4:          00:52:54       Did you watch Kimmel last night? No, dude. They ran out of power and they, that's what was going on. They all right. So anyways, I think I looked at it and I'm like, that's completely the marketing, you know, that's completely like a good idea to advertise the green Hornet trailer that they premiered and stuff like that because they, it was weird because they were like, we don't have power for the cameras, but yet then they're in a room where the tvs are on and the lights are on. I'm like, well, I mean, what's the, what kind of cameras do not just plugging a lot I guess. And we can find out. We can find out what it was. Genius. It was John Barris will tell us. Yeah, Don was on it last night. He was taking the laptop and show him like, Hey, Don calling don bears right now.

Speaker 4:          00:53:30       Do not release this information. But what's weird is that that uh, I bet that got so much ratings because of that you don't have that little gimmick and stuff like that. The whole show was watching this use stream on tv and it's brilliant because what if, what was he was doing it in photo booth or whatever. That Mac. A Basic Mac program that comes with it. Photo. It's totally scam. Scam. I don't know because half of you wants to go. No, this. I could see this accident on television and so the whole episode was filmed with a Shitty Webcam, you know, on his Mac book and I'm like, wait, what if that becomes popular? We start going backwards with our hdtvs. We're now watching ustream shitty videos. No one. I didn't mind it. I mean I only watch a couple of minutes. The sound is what got me. It was awesome.

Speaker 2:          00:54:17       When I was A. I was watching a fight and I shut it off and I was getting ready to go to bed and when I shut the light off, the regular tv came on, the fight was on the dvr and then it was on and I was like, what the fuck is going on here? But it made me tune in

Speaker 4:          00:54:27       because I was like, yeah, it worked. It worked. Come off. Watch how often do you actually watch talk shows? Do you want to talk to you about that much? I tivo. I like wait for the youtube clips because if like letterman said something really hilarious, it's going to be in a youtube clip. I mean I don't have an hour and I tivo them all and then if somebody says, hey, did you watch the Lenovo or whatever, and I'm like, oh, watch that. Then I gave you a lot at that time too because I go up late. We're isn't being friends with all you comics because all of you like it can't do anything except go to comedy clubs every night. Like he pretty much right off your life at a comedy club every single night because like I was going through some tough times recently. I'm like, Hey, who can I call?

Speaker 4:          00:55:07       No, I don't want to see your show. I've already seen it. Hey, how you doing? Oh No, I don't want to go see your show. Like you guys never stopped. Like, Hey, come to my show. Come to my show. It never stops. Maybe you're just an awesome audience. Members bring your camera, Brian, what the real problem is, Brian, is that they have to go up. I know that's the only way you can hang out. How do you, how do you guys devote so much of your life though too? Because I'm not talking about like every night, especially weekends. You have to work man. I mean if you want to be a comic, you got to work. You, you're a writer yourself,

Speaker 2:          00:55:41       producer, you're the director, you know, if you putting out a shit product directly affect, you know, reflects on you, you gotta be careful. You gotta work at it, you know, and stand up comedy man. If I take a couple of weeks off, I feel rusty doing it 22 fucking years and I'd take a couple of weeks off and I'm like, Ooh, I'm a little rusty here. I'm not feeling this right though.

Speaker 4:          00:55:59       I was uh, I was in Australia even though I was gigging out there and I came back and I did a store set and I got heckled right out the gate and it went bad fast too. It was like

Speaker 2:          00:56:10       goals or dark, Bro. There's something about heckling in the store that leads much quicker to violence and anger and like real tension. I've never had people throw shit at me, but I've had two people throw things at me at the store. It's

Speaker 4:          00:56:21       so weird, man. And the, the bouncers are all

Speaker 1:          00:56:24       emo fucks borders and fucking death cab for cutie or something like that. There's some big fuck in the, in the, the uh, original room and he's yelling at somebody like, remember when he ultimately got knocked out? Knocked out holtzman. Yeah. Martin Lawrence was fucked up in the audience, but I don't know if he was fucked up. I might've been added that part to it. But in a big night for him though, like ICM was down. All the people from ICM, it come down to see holtzman. So they saw him get knocked out. They saw the crazy. Lawrence might've just changed his whole career path. Like, no, you're not going to become a movie star band without change. Holtmann's career path. Well, I mean, what if those guys were like, dude, we love this comic. They said they were like, did he just got knocked out? Yeah, maybe, I dunno, you know, Holtzman was the type of guy that would kill kill comedians.

Speaker 1:          00:57:17       He would kill us, but it was a lot of people that didn't see it as a goof and they thought it was just, he was just this really Douchey, angry man. He didn't see how funny it was. The main fucked up shit that he was saying with that, that character. Now the comedy store doesn't work. It doesn't, it. The comedy store is such a dark evil fucking place for people that don't know. The comedy store used to be Ciro's nightclub and Bugsy Siegel ran that place in the fifties and the forties, wherever the fuck it was. What was that? I think the forties, forties. Bugsy Siegel apparently had a bunch of people murdered. Yeah. Shane. And apparently, you know, everybody that works there has these creepy fucking horror stores, you know, they all talk about ghosts and shit. But that said, almost everybody that works there is crazy and does drugs with a, the grants salt.

Speaker 1:          00:58:06       My friends always found funny about ghost man is like, I don't know if you ever watch, um, paranormal shows, you know, and those show up and they'll interview the person and there'll be like, you know, and then fire came out of the walls and the blood was everywhere and then they'll do like dead time thing when see that curtain move. Yeah, that's bullshit. It's all night vision and a basement. What's that noise? Every show nobody ever goes on video you have to do is fucking go to a cemetery like midnight on Halloween and just go find somebody that murdered wife or something like that and start making fun of her, you know? And like nothing will happen. They'll go, has ever killed anybody, man, you know, do you like, I've, I was always taught that like ghosts. Maybe we're like, it's all energy man. And maybe energy gets lost in some kind of wealth transfer. If you look at our existence on this planet as it were in a frequency. You know, and this is, I mean if you don't understand how this works, but quantum physicists believe that there are 11 dimensions as the current model of reality. 11 different dimensions. Obviously we can't to intercede those 11 different dimensions and if we, from what we know about like radio waves, think about like radio waves, thinking about how, you know, 97 point one is loud and clear

Speaker 2:          00:59:22       and I have to do is turn that dial and you're on one. Oh, seven point nine. Totally different music, loud and clear. It's like there are frequencies, very specific frequencies. If that exists with something as intangible as radio waves, how do we not assume that that doesn't work with reality as well? Maybe. Maybe you know, maybe there's so many different things that are tuned in around us all the time. They're just on a frequency that we can't detect and it doesn't interact with this frequency, but all this shit is going on together in one big just fucking crazy cosmic soup. You know, if that's the case, shit, anything's possible. Ghosts, there could be. I mean, what a ghost could be somehow or another. The energy of the experience of what happened to them when they got murdered or something like that, you know, because it's always like horror stories always.

Speaker 2:          01:00:04       The guy had an awesome life and now he's a ghost. It's fucking brutally raped and murdered and then they, they roamed that house. Maybe that experience maybe the spiritual horror and shock and terrorists so powerful that it actually leaves like a, like a, you know when your monitor gets frozen on a screen and then it like stays on that image. There's like the ghost of that image in the background. You know what I mean? Because it got too much energy from that one position. It got locked into that one pattern and so the old, especially those old shitty screens aren't turned in you. You would burn in an image. It's very possible that an image of someone dying and extremely horrible way is actually burned into the world. But that said, I think most people are completely fucking full of shit and they're just dumb.

Speaker 2:          01:00:47       They're just in basements. Fucking goggles on. Why is it always gay guys and fat chicks do that shit, but it's the same people that would be into like goth music and spring, the spring or breed. It's the cheater breed. It's all those shows that the same breed, you know, that's a Brita human as there's always people that are looking for something mysterious, you know? That's why I love monster quest. I got a little bit of that in myself that like getting into like fucking secret shit to. Do you think sasquatch is real? I mean, I've gotten so far as like read. I've probably read a dozen books on sasquatch. I tell there's no. It's real might be, but this is why I might be. There's a. there's an animal called gigantic [inaudible] that lived in Asia and that animal lived exactly where the same Asians who came across the bering strait and came to America and eventually became the native Americans that they came from the same place.

Speaker 2:          01:01:36       So if this animal, this big gigantic eight foot tall bipedal primate that actually lived. If that was in North America, if it came across the bering strait with the people who's to say it didn't, that could live in the Pacific northwest like, but actually seeing it by now, we would've me, you know. Let me tell you something. From living in the mountains and from talking to people that live in the mountains, it's, there's so many, there's so many mountain lions are so many bear. There's so many fucking animals up there and you rarely see them. And the thing is when you do see them, you see live ones, you never find a dead one. It's very rare because the forest eats the fucking animals and if you're in a place like the Pacific northwest, have you fly over that area, it's so dense like you don't realize how vast the forest until you fly over there.

Speaker 2:          01:02:20       It's basically a rain forest. The Pacific northwest is incredibly dense woods where nobody goes. How the Loch Ness. I mean it's like, it's stupid. Who Cares? There's fucking killer whales in the ocean. They're real. They're super intelligent. They speak in dialects, they save people. The only time they murder peoples in captivity, those are real things that are killer whales. Save people, save people. Yeah. No killer was ever killed anybody. I don't care about the size or the loch ness monster. He just wrote that off that quickly. Fish. It doesn't do shit. This guy might just be a person. That tall guy that lives in.

Speaker 2:          01:02:53       I'm not totally sold on bigfoot. I'm not sold. I'm not saying that it exists on the exact same level of bullshit, you know, like we would have found them, but it's possible that with the loch ness monsters, they think it's might be Aplysia sore that somehow or another got landlocked, but there's not enough evidence. They've looked really hard. They've done sonar searches of the entire ocean floor or the entire lock floor. See, it's not like the woods and in, you know, in Oregon or something like that where you really can't get in there. It's not like that. It's just one specific body of water so they can do a pretty thorough job of looking inside for anything big that swims and if there's a fucking thing that's been around for a long time, chances are there's a family of them. He spot a few of them and then that spot and shit, they don't find anything that if you only get a blip, probably a fucking turtle farts or something like that.

Speaker 2:          01:03:45       It doesn't. It doesn't interest me because it doesn't do anything to the primate thing interests me because of the. The idea that this thing could be superintelligence just like champs and avoid people. You know who the Congo. Okay. There's, there's an animal in the Congo that they've just recently discovered recently being they. They confirmed it in the 1990. It's called the Bondo ape or the billy ape and what this is is a gigantic chimpanzee. They're much bigger than regular. Chimpanzees is like six feet tall and they stand upright and they have gray hair. A lot of them have gray hair and they fucking sleep on the ground like gorillas. They don't give a fuck. Nothing fucks with them. And there's two types of chimps that the, uh, the people that live in that part of the jungle, they call them, the regular ones are tree beaters and lion killers.

Speaker 2:          01:04:29       There's tree beaters in lion killers and these guys were recently in the Congo filming this fucking thing. This is a bonafide, absolute real animal. They have DNA, they have photographs, they have video, they have bones, they have a first samples, they have all these different things that show that it's some sort of a, some sort of a new species of chimpanzees and it's fucking living in the Congo. They know where it is. They know where it is right now, but they didn't fucking know about this until this wasn't confirmed until like the nineties, like [inaudible] 94, I think it was when they all came to a consensus and said, hey, this is a real animal, will have a giant chimp that sleeps on the fucking ground. They have video of one evening a Jaguar. Okay. These fucking guys came upon it and it was eating a Jaguar.

Speaker 2:          01:05:11       They don't know if it killed the Jaguar, not but the local say they do. But what the fuck, man, what the fuck? That's a real animal. That's a real animal that lives in the Congo. It's very possible that there could be some super high, high intelligence level primate that survive just with a couple hundred of them in a very small part of the woods and they have amazing hearing, an amazing sense of smell, and they just avoid humans because it's too difficult to get to them. So they stayed tightly packed in. There's plenty of fucking food. If they're vegetarians there, which they probably are. Otherwise they wouldn't be eating people, you know. Sure. Right. If there were predators at all, there had been people and then we would hear crazy stories about the meeting people, but everybody that sees them, nobody gets eaten in the middle of the night. Nobody gets their tent pulled apart. So most likely they're like gorillas. Gorillas are vegetarians to. So they're probably just a big fucking vegetarian animal that lives in the woods. It doesn't mean that exists, but it's fucking possible.

Speaker 6:          01:06:02       What was the animal that they thought was the mermaid? And you're like, how lonely were you when you thought that this fucking beast was a woman? I saw it in Australia. I can't remember the name of it. I don't even know. It's not a manatee county. What is it? Got? Damn it. I don't know. Google. Google that shit, son. I don't. I've never even heard this. Yeah, it's, it's a, there's an actual animal that they basically thought we were mermaids. Like those guys are so desperate out there. They're looking for chicks wherever they can find it.

Speaker 2:          01:06:35       Two, could you imagine? I mean, look, we live in Hollywood, pneumonia fucker. Rubber Pussy Convention. A horny those dudes be when the brown boats for like six months. Fuck the pussy. Were you like, I don't know about rubber one. You one. You mean the flashlight? No, no, I have no shame. Just stuck on my deck and squirt inside it and that was it. I was like, wow. That's pretty good. Good Dude. You bust a strong. Not Strong. Is that a man?

Speaker 6:          01:07:01       I know it was a different name though. I'll find it out. Yeah. No, it's a different name. I'll tell you. Sure. Yeah. It's not a manatee

Speaker 2:          01:07:09       Sam triply making shit up. Caught them, ladies and gentlemen. No way man. That shit kind goes saying manatees. What kind of balls those guys have to have that lived in like fucking England when we get on boats and go across the ocean, think about that shit on. Look at a map, look at where the fucking continents are and think about how fucking crazy you would have to be to take a boat, fill it up with enough food to hopefully make it to the other side. Yesterday had a, do you have a stuffed up pitch with food and ration that shit off and people would die because they didn't get enough vitamin C, they'd get fucking scurvy and it right away. It's crazy. And they just throw them in the water

Speaker 6:          01:07:44       about the uh, the uh, pirate cook. Did you read that? No, it was on Huffington Post. One of these smiling pirate cooks turned on all of his crew and he gave all the hostages guns. He's feeding them because you know, they were getting abused. He was feeding them. They started hearing the pirates talk about harvesting their organs. So he got them all like guns and they, they attacked the, killed all the pirates. Now here's what's crazy is no country

Speaker 3:          01:08:15       will accept this pirate. They won't accept them. So this guy who ratted out his friends and gave them the guns, they won't accept him. You say ratted or save some people. Either one. Yeah. Well you just decided it was too much or maybe he didn't like them. Maybe they were Douche bags. Maybe he's a Douche bag to the brow, you know, and that they were just douche bags as well and they didn't get along. You know, it might not be a good guy, bad guy. Situation. Like say some people who were hostages. Sure he did. But maybe it's because he hated those other dudes. This motherfucker already keep enough money this month. Uh, fuck I showed them. I flick when you come back for the food I give you, can I give you a gun? You highlight pirate living with me. You don't need to play pool or alarm system.

Speaker 3:          01:08:55       Yeah. But maybe he decides to kill you. Fuck your girlfriend. Maybe duct tapes a pistol inside your mouth. Like fucks your woman. How about that crazy shit dude. That guy's living wild. Son has a fucking pirate and all over the seat. I bet you know. Never give a fuck. You clean it out. Clean. Cleaned my clock. Cleaned my think I fuck with you now. Clean. You have to clean his dick. He pisses and it makes it clean. You'll be a have a Somali pilot in your house. That's like living with a wild man bro. They're wild bro. They don't have any future this. When you living in Somalia like what's the, what's the future? They don't give a fuck. They're ready to die. You know they don't give a fuck dude. They're out. Jack and ships. They're getting a little rowboats with machine guns and rocket launchers and they're climbing on board.

Speaker 3:          01:09:43       Big giant ships and Jack and everybody. They are fucking locators, man. Well that's what they say about a terrorists who blow themselves up. It's not really religion. It's more about. They just have nothing going on there. There's this book called a why two beautiful people have more daughters. It's about evolutionary psychology and they talk about that. It's not really religion, it's more about that. These guys feel, yeah, they have, they have no chance to make money and they have no chance of meeting a woman because they're so broke and like all the rich guys get all the chicks, so it's like that's why they get promised like, hey, you get all these virgins and you get all this stuff. Those are also the people that you can get to doing something because they just want to belong. They want to be special. They want to be treated like they're special and you know when they're getting someone to become a suicide bomber.

Speaker 3:          01:10:31       If you ever looked at like there was a special. I don't remember what show was on, but they were in somewhere in the Middle East and they have this school and on the school they had these photographs of these people that have blown themselves up and we're all this religious writing on it and there was a big sign above the school that says today's children are tomorrow's holy martyrs. And like God damn like they're there. The attention that they give to those children, they make them out to be heroes. They make them out to be special that so many people want people's love and affection and they want. They want to be special so badly that they're willing to do almost anything. Yeah, it's crazy, man. It's like, don't you wish you go back in time and just rewrite some of the religious books? Take out all the asshole stuff. You know what I'm saying? It's like throughout

Speaker 2:          01:11:14       time people have always bullshitted other people to control them. I mean, it's so simple. It's so obvious. It's existed forever. What's amazing though is that the bullshit that worked like 2000 years ago still works today just because it's written, you know, it's just, this is what, this is what it is. I mean, it's like, you know, when you, when you really get into it and you start reading about women being treated as second class citizens, condoning slavery, condoning murder, all the crazy shit that's in religious texts, all that nutty shit that people still suck on it. Two thousand years later, years later, I always thought that religion was more like a, just like early science, like people trying to explain, just laying down the law, man, it's laying down the law and laying it down. It wants to stay. I listen to you, cause if you don't go down, that's what it is.

Speaker 2:          01:12:01       It's like you've got to keep dummies in line with crazy talk and that crazy talk spread and it became a good way to keep social order intact. Key people, you know, in small towns, man, go to the church, everybody's all happy and friendly and it makes everybody together, you know. But if you look at like all these people that are doing fucked up things in the world, you know, whether it's suicide bombers were Somali pirates, they come from somewhere that fucking sucks. And that's what it all boils down to. Their life fucking sucks though. Somali pirates did you know the whole story behind that? Why they became pirates? Dude, they call themselves the people, but if they call themselves the fucking, the volunteer coastguard of Somalia, that's what they call themselves. And what happened was European ships and companies and I believe some Americans to we're dumping waste into their waters and fucking up there fishing man.

Speaker 2:          01:12:50       And they found out about this because there are fish were dying and what they did was kidnap a boat that was illegally trespassing through their waters and they demanded a ransom because this was one of the boats that was polluting the waters. And these guys were fishermen, man. There were fishermen that had their livelihoods fucked up and taken away from them. So they turned to crime and they started jacking people because they've got so much from the first boat. They just turned it into a business and now they just jack people constantly. Dudes. You're getting jacked all the time, man. If you. There are hundreds of miles out to sea just looking for people. Man,

Speaker 4:          01:13:25       what do you think about the 16 year old girl? That's my whole point about saying her around the world. It's like, man, when you leave America, it's a whole different game to women's

Speaker 2:          01:13:35       parents are so foolish. That's so foolish. There's one thing to let some experience someone something. There's another thing to put someone out in the wild just to get it. What are you going to get a rush out of? The fact that he made it across, you know, you did something that could kill you mean one of the benefits. Is it so difficult and you did it. She's amazing. She did something. You did something that I can do in a plain stupid you can get in a plane and that can be across that ocean and 10 hours. Why the fuck would you spend five weeks in a sailboat that's retarded. That's not a smart way

Speaker 4:          01:14:06       because that's a hell of a facebook status. That's why you know, that's all she's thinking about it like I until

Speaker 2:          01:14:12       they going to do it, it's gonna be so cool. And where do you go from there? I mean, you're 16. You keep going around the world. What do you do next? These assholes are getting hot, hot air balloon guys over. If I stay out around the road, whatever you want to get wet this with, this wants you to treat her. She's special. She's doing something special that people are crazy. They're nuts. It's a crazy fucking desire with chicken San Diego over that. She's like, would you send a 16 year old boy? I'm like, before 16 year old girl. Yes. I would send a 16 old boy before 16 year old girl, but I wouldn't send a 16 year old either, but I love my boy that I raised and I'm going to put him in harm's way. I would tell them, listen, man, I don't want to be alone in the woods.

Speaker 2:          01:14:50       If you want to do something scary, let's get you involved in some competition. Okay? You don't want to fucking wrestle in high school. You want to. You want to do some boxing and kickboxing or something crazy. Wanted to fight some MMA fights. You want to do something crazy? Let's do something that we can control you. Not going to put you in the fucking ocean. That's nuts. All right. I understand the, uh, the rising above, like accomplishing crazy things, doing things that appear to be impossible. They give you more of an understanding of yourself. They don't just give you this rush. They give you an understanding of what you're capable of. They give you more confidence, it gives you more you, you, you get a sense of what you're capable of performing. What you're capable of doing under pressure makes you more, you know, like there's a quote that I read once about taekwondo, that fighting and competing and in Taekwondo, it elevates your human potential.

Speaker 2:          01:15:36       You know, like it, it gives you, you have more potential because you've already experienced harder, more difficult things. That's all well and good. I understand that, but fucking putting yourself in the ocean and putting yourself in a position where, look, there could be some shit happened to you that you have no way of escaping. There's no way getting it out. You're gonna get a nice thrill because you're going to put your life in danger, but the reality is you're just getting from one place to another. That's all you're doing. You're doing it old school, you're just getting from one place to another old school. That's all you're doing. You know, it's so stupid. It's like, you know, if someone chose to walk across America and they starve to death along the way, we should. We feel bad for them. What the fuck are you doing?

Speaker 2:          01:16:16       What do you. What is southwestern New York? It's like fucking 300 bucks. I mean, come on, man. Really, you're going to walk across the country and clearly agree with you fucking asshole. This is crazy parents there. I mean, you've got to push your kids to a point. You have to push your kids. You know people don't push it out to push your kids. Well, I mean you gotta think you'd give them some discipline and you know, but you, you teach them that with risk and with, you know, with work become come satisfaction. You get to achieve something and that satisfying and it makes you understand and appreciate yourself better. It makes you understand people better. It makes you function better. It's more like. It's like lifting weights. You lift weights, you get stronger, you get stronger. You can pick things up easier. It's that simple. Wouldn't life you take on difficult tasks. You take on difficult, difficult things that caused you to think because your mind to spend caused you to react quickly caused you to make good choices that elevates your human potential. It's really that simple.

Speaker 4:          01:17:10       Nope, I agree. People don't do shit, man. Oh, your phone motherfuckers that shit. Of course it is. You get it on your laptop. I saw it, but we all have mics. Yeah, but you're on your computer. You don't still here. That's a phantom sound son. Phantom. Phantom. Speaking of phones tomorrow I found. Have you guys been watching? They're looking at the reviews. The reviews are for G. I'm scared. The reviews are fucking amazing, man. I'm thinking att and t service is going to hit an all time shitty low and so that hopefully not. But you know, one of the cool things that all the reviews are saying is how great the video calling works in. Like it's just perfect. Like it works a video. You could switch from front to back camps. So like if you're talking to me and you go, oh my God, look at this guy, he's doing this, you know, and it'll switch to the front of the camera. Apple is the future. It is just crazy. They're masters at marketing their masters or getting people excited about their products. Yeah. Oh I am. I mean the phones, what else do you use most everyday? A phone. Oh, you're going to buy the first one. You know, not to buy the first one.

Speaker 4:          01:18:15       I mean you're, you're going to buy like right out the gate and then two weeks later it's going to be like half price, but not logic. You should never buy anything. Just wait. The iphone, stolen iphones don't change price at all. Like throughout the whole year. It's usually almost exactly the same thing that they weren't crazy about. I think. Yeah, it was the iphone where like all these guys wait in line. They bought it for like a gazillion dollars. Oh, the first iphone, the first iphone, it was half price. They flipped out when it first came out with the price. When the first iphone came out, it was $100 more and then they dropped it $100. They gave everyone $100 back. Didn't they recently lowered the price of the three g or they're always doing that because they're still selling that, but they're still selling the second generation one for like 49 bucks or something like that. And she says, I am son now, but don't get the new shit. New Shit drops. A little, little frugal shopper. Pablo Escobar son, I gotta I gotta sell you a super vhs real speaking of frugal shopper.

Speaker 2:          01:19:13       Do you guys hear about that? A fucking federal judge that blocked the, uh, the, he obama to put a moratorium. It was trying to put a moratorium on offshore drilling. So this federal judge drops it, you know, he won't. He blocks the moratorium and everybody's like, what the fuck? Who is this guy? This guy's crazy. The Obama says he wants to stop oil drilling. There's a giant fucking hole where oil is leaking out of the ocean. Were like, hey, we might have a fucking problem here. We gotta make sure this is ruining the ocean for hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of miles. Anyway, it turns out this federal judge has stock in the company and in Trans Ocean they have stock his stock at five different companies that are involved in the selling business. Wow. This motherfucker can literally profit from his own decision.

Speaker 4:          01:20:04       How crazy is they should not be allowed to do this. Should not be allowed

Speaker 1:          01:20:08       to have money. If that guy, if that guy was on the case, they should have said, I, you know, we see that you have stock in this, in this company that could, you know, in your decisions could adversely affect you financially. So we're going to remove you from this case. I mean, that's, that's what rational person like with everything though, like if you win a prize at, wait, are you, do you work for NBC or any of its affiliates? You know, that's how like everything always is with everyone else except the president is not as voided from it. That's weird man. How these guys have this detach, detach from just humanity. You know what I'm saying? It's just straight evil. Anybody that would think that the oil business knows exactly what they're doing and that this couldn't happen again. It's crazy. Just because it's only happened a few times in history, it doesn't mean that these things are deteriorating at a rapid pace and that, you know, the ones that have been around for a long time, we don't know how long they're gonna last things happen.

Speaker 1:          01:20:58       Things fuck up, you know the whole, there's other wells out there that are built like this one. They say, you know, the whole deregulation thing. It's so ridiculous. Like what the market needs. Deregulation. It's like, it makes no sense. That's like saying we don't need laws because we'll just regulate each other. Well, you know, we get crazy too and say, look, you know, we need to lower the pressure labor to compete. We have to go to China. We have to go, what the fuck are you talking? We don't have to at all. No, you don't have to at all. You just kind of stopped being too greedy. That's it. You're going to get less profit, but you're going to get a fucking. What you're selling is a product that's not made on people. People's fucking souls. You know, you're, you're going to sell a product that's not poor people that live in a fucking village and in China and then they have to look at what was it, Foxconn and we talk about all the time.

Speaker 1:          01:21:43       It's fucking company that makes iphone parts and shit. Dude. They got people killing themselves left and right over there who left and right. They're literally shutting down all their plants because there's so many suicides and there's so much scandal. These people are working like God knows how many hours a day they're living on the site. You know? That's. That's what companies are doing, man. Companies are going to people like that. That's the iphone too, but Walmart's to worst to that company makes the iphone. Yeah. Or at least parts of the iphone. No warrants the worst. Yeah, man. [inaudible], they go. They're like, I don't believe that hype at all. I think Walmart does a lot. Like you either can see that point of yeah, Walmart comes in and they don't pay anything, but I also see a walmart fucking striving for jobs and that go into these towns.

Speaker 1:          01:22:28       Really disagree with that. It's like, first of all, what they do is they keep driving down the price and everything, so eventually these people who produced the goods they buy are going to have to almost go to slave labor. I think it's either or. I don't think either one of you guys is right, both right, but what what Walmart does is it comes in to a community and it basically has the lowest prices, right? So it puts mom and pop stores the pops and all this stuff out and then seems like a good idea and they don't pay a real good wage to work there to what? Go to Walmart. Like that person makes six bucks an hour. The other jobs gone. You got to go

Speaker 4:          01:23:06       work somewhere. But before that, before that, there was no jobs that didn't exist. Those 300 jobs at blacksmith goes out of business right here. But you know what the big thing is that retail is dead no matter what. So Walmart could be doing all they want to, but guess what? Walmart ain't as cheap as fuck. And Amazon, Amazon. Amazon is not his fucking growing like a monster. I buy groceries now on Amazon. I'm buying coconut water by the case. You know, I don't even need to be a costco member or any of that because they sell the same shit now. And you don't have to be a costco delivered to your house, they deliver it right to your house and you can put it on schedule like I want this every two weeks, you know, automatically ship going somewhere and buying something helps your community. Would you do that to a point? But I'm also not going to pay $300 more for a fucking tv, you know. And I'm like, sorry, fucking think of what's next in your job career. If you can't sell this TV cheaper than this person, I'm not going to buy it simple.

Speaker 3:          01:24:02       I don't think that people have an obligation to be able to continue to sell you things. I think if something comes along the consultings for much cheaper and at the same quality, if it's the same product. Yeah, exactly. I mean, I, I'm loyal to friends and I, there's a couple of businesses that I support that I know charge more than they probably should for things like our pot doctor, but I don't care, you know, it's just like I have a sense of loyalty to them, but I've got some discretionary income if you don't man, 300 bucks is a lot of fucking money. And why would you pay $3? Was being generous. That's 300 bucks plus no tax plus free about that, but just can't get the kind of deals that Walmart can, you know, tough shit man. This, I think it's either or. It's. I can see both points of view.

Speaker 3:          01:24:44       I see Brian's point of view where it helps communities and it brings in jobs and shit. But I can see your point of view that it's like, well, you're given these people this mediocre life and they fucking. They don't really save jobs because they put some businesses under. It's okay man. It's all just change. Just normal. You know? There's no good or bad. See, some people just aren't meant to be doctors and lawyers. And when you take away all their opportunities to like build stuff on, what else? Is there a true though? No, you don't. You just have to offer a service that other people aren't offering for less. It's not. You can't

Speaker 4:          01:25:13       just have to figure it out. You have to figure to figure it out because if whatever you're doing, if Walmart can get it cheaper, you have to figure out either how you could get it cheap or have a service that, that Walmart doesn't work.

Speaker 3:          01:25:23       My family's been in this business for 30 fucking years. If you say it's okay for Walmart coming to our town where we grew up, you don't own the town, you don't want a patch of dirt. You don't own the rights to sell what you're saying about that. But it's like it goes back to like everybody's like capitalism and free enterprise. Well this isn't what it was like 200 years ago. You know, when everything started to definitely says it was mom and pops. Now you got these huge corporations. Like when, when the Supreme Court says that a huge corporation is like an individual, while they're not a kazillion billion dollars behind them. You're talking about for a campaign contribution. Even in the

Speaker 4:          01:26:04       market though, you're like, we'll find a way to sell for less than Walmart. Well, you never can because they buy in such huge. Yeah. But that's not even it down. I was saying you didn't have to do that or you have to find a new service at that Walmart doesn't offer like that. Like if you're selling phones. All right. I will have a cell that you're the same phone. It's gonna be a little more. But guess what, I'm going to be coming to, you know, a tech support giving you this. I'm going to, I'm gonna you know, anytime you need to get a new computer, bring it in and I'll fucking transfer all your contacts over there. Fucking walmart ain't going to do that shit. You got to change with the Times. You know what I mean? These stores that I went in the other day too, like this store and I bought a Webcam just because, uh, the, the one at best buy, they were sold out.

Speaker 4:          01:26:47       So I just like, all right, I'll go to this little mom and pop electronic store. And they had like an old version of the Webcam. It was dusty, you know, I'm like, I'm just sitting here going like, this is an old product that a fuck. It's the same price as the new product at best buy. But you know, I didn't even want to even buy it because what? They can't even turn enough product to where they're shit they're selling is outdated. It's not current shit. And so I'm like, that's a problem. It's not, it's not Walmart's far as the change of times. It's Amazon, it's all this. And if you think you're going to have a retail store in today's times, you got to really fucking start using your brain because you need to offer a service that fucking, I can't Amazon just going to kill you regardless. And then we're not even care about Walmart and Amazon's gonna kill Walmart eventually.

Speaker 2:          01:27:28       You know, big corporations aren't killing all businesses. You're always gonna have like restaurants that are great restaurants because you know the cook is awesome. He's always got interesting stuff to eat there. You're not going to get that from some fucking chain. You know, some corporate chain you're going to get like there's gonna be places of you're always going to want to go do that, have personality to them to have flair that offer a certain environment or ambiance. But as long as the way things are continuing to go, the way they're going, there's so many fucking people in this world. There's so many people. These corporations get so big because of that. There's so many, so many people to pull under. You know, there's so much to go after. It doesn't seem like that's a trend that's going to stop. I don't see the idea of us, you know, going into little small groups and businesses and you know, and goods being distributed like that.

Speaker 2:          01:28:10       It's just going to continue to get bigger and bigger. What do you think of that woman who has like 25 kids? Which one is she should be shot? Is that on that TV show now? There's a will. There's one TV show, the family that I was like 19, 21 or something, something like that. I think that lady adopted this woman's literally gave birth like, oh, that lady gave birth. The lady on the TV show really like super religious, whole family. Family's really cheesy, but on a rigid schedule and serial killers, do you think are in their family? They're all cool. They're all friendly. They're all happy. They're all looking at the sense of community they have down to a science. I think serial killers come from loneliness and abandonment. Religious. These people aren't abused. They're. They seem happy. You know what I mean? They're, they're little loony with the religion. Right.

Speaker 4:          01:28:55       Have hot sex orgies and we don't even know about it, but 20, 25 years and how dare you,

Speaker 3:          01:29:02       do you think they should like why do we need 25 of them? You know what man? Here's what my deal is. Way Better to have 25 people that are nice and happy than 25 people that are all fucked up and strung out on drugs and fucking angry and shooting people and whatever those people on that show. I watched that show once the kids, they might be all ate up with Jesus, but you know what? They're talking happy. They're good people. They're good people too. That whole Jesus thing, man is good for a lot of folks. It's very whether or not you want to question whether or not you want to be objective about the source of all the stories that are in the Bible and whatever the bottom line is. Most Christians are trying to be nice people. Yeah, that's what it's all about. It's a good thing, man.

Speaker 3:          01:29:38       Imagine them without religion, stuff like that before, and people think I'm bullshitting and um, you know, I'm, I'm patronizing people, but I'm not. I think religion for a lot of people is a good thing. The idea behind it is all a good thing. It's just believing that you've got the fucking answers because you've committed to it. That's where the problem comes in. The problem is when people get aggressive with their, their commitment, they have a commitment and you'll have to scratch my personal savior. How about the fucking guy that we were talking about them last week they went to a. he's in Afghanistan right now looking for Osama bin Ladin. They arrested him 52 fucking years old on dialysis. This looney toons saving up all his money and one of the reasons why he's going over there to kill Osama bin Ladin is because he said bad things about our God.

Speaker 3:          01:30:22       Dude, where are your friends? I just, I don't trust anyone who's too into anything to what it is. Well, even if I walk in and saw Jesus Christ or Brett Farve, whatever, I'm like, okay, you're fucking shady. Dude. That's so true. People that are fucking obsessed with anything. Everything in moderation. You can be obsessed with fucking checkers. Men. You can get obsessed with darts and you get obsessed with anything and it can become your whole world. You know? And if you get obsessed with Jesus and you want everybody to believe in Jesus, you believe in Jesus, so you fucking want to run up to people on the street and hand them books and shit and tell them God. Have you ever seen the movie king of Kong? No, I heard it's awesome. Oh, they're obsessed with video games. It's great to do those people exist to real people.

Speaker 3:          01:31:09       We used to be a part of a clan and I guess I still am. You know, you're in it for life. But clam detriment. I, I used to play eight hours a day. I got a t one line installed in my house back when there was nothing else. Well you can't get cable in my neighborhood. You can get ISD n which is only like what is that 124 k or something like that. Not One hundred. What is it? 50 slash 40. I never got into like twice 56 K, 120 k, something like that. I think that's what I. Sdn is maybe 140 and there wasn't enough. You're paying your latency between service was too high, so when you would play there'd be a lag. It sucked. So I had a fucking t one lines installed in my house, a business line. It's like a thousand dollars a month just so that I could play quake online because I was playing every day. She see this new pain ray that the US is testing in Afghanistan. I heard about it. It's like this big fucking like laser. It's out like a microwave

Speaker 6:          01:32:00       and it just makes you feel really hot. It's going to be non lethal way for that crowd control. They're just going to start frying. Or with Micromedex, they talked about that. I'm like 60 minutes and it was so interesting because they were like, you know, they were demonstrating it and the people they were using on where people were like, no war, they had the no war sign. I'm like, that's who you're going to use it on. Like they were old, no size. I'm like, that's crazy dude. Oh my God. I got through not using it right now. They just have it over there just in case this the. They want to use it

Speaker 2:          01:32:33       looking actively at the beginning of the Iraq war, I read a story online about coming up with some sort of a weapon to make men have gay feelings for each other to turn it on the Iraqi troops they were, when we invaded Iraq, they were going to somehow or another come up with some sort of a weapon like they fucking spent money on,

Speaker 6:          01:32:52       you know, in Afghanistan. They have man loved Thursdays. I've heard of that. Yeah, yeah, I've heard that there's a lot of sex going on over there. They, uh, they, uh, they think women are for reproduction, mentor for pleasure. And every Thursday they go into the mountains and they just asked, blessed each other who had somebody. A comic has a funny bit about that man. Where the fuck is that? That's awful. Somebody went over to Afghanistan and actually saw some guys fucking each other. Well, it's like I was talking to some troops when I did a us over there and uh, you know, they were trained in the Afghany troops and like within their troop they had a boy there in the group whose whole job it was, was the pleasure the guys and they, they had to tell the troops not the same thing because that's their custom and not to get involved with that stuff. You're royal penises, clean tm. I don't even know why we're fighting over there, man. You go over there like this is a shit hole. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:33:51       We should just do the gdn and I hear what they just discovered. They discovered well over $1,000,000,000,000 in mineral reserves, previously unknown mineral reserves in Afghanistan. Oh look, we just discussed. We didn't even know was here. Wow. Crazy. Well, since we're here, might as well start pulling the shit out of the ground. She's going to change. Son. Ever leave into. Let me tell you some. Afghanistan is going to be like Dubai in 20 years. Okay. We're going to have it over the whole fucking country. It's going to be democratized and they'll have 2 million mile high buildings. Okay. There's a trillion dollars worth of minerals there that's going to be this crazy mining town. It's just like how we need gold with these minerals we need for making semiconductors and all kinds of other shit that we, we, you know, we use things for, to construct stuff, you know, especially high tech stuff. We use a lot of minerals.

Speaker 6:          01:34:38       It's like a trillion dollars worth of stuff. That's a thousand billion. It's a lot of Sun. Dude. Shit's going to get Chris to do a joke about. The only person who could run Iraq is magic Johnson because you know, he made like almost a billion dollars in like just redoing like apartments, all that stuff.

Speaker 3:          01:34:57       And like, you know, give them like two weeks. Fucking Baghdad would look like fucking Orange County and whoever you put in charge in there, they're going to try to assassinate anyways. And you know, we all know you can't kill Magic Johnson. Somebody tried. So it's been a while since I did that joke. I couldn't remember how it went. CIA planned to bomb Iraq with Saddam. Gave video. Oh, that's different than. We're going to make a fake. Gave video. That's funny. The CIA did Photoshop. Can you imagine? We like like auditioning for that. The US army soldier. When you do to take down your pants. I'll fuck this guy. Yeah. What do they do? Kill you afterwards. They, if they're going to make a fucking fake Saddam Hussein video, they can't let you go. If you're the type of person that's willing to make a fake gay Saddam Hussein video, they can't trust you to keep your fucking mouth shut at the government paid you.

Speaker 3:          01:35:47       They're going to kill you, man. Well, unless they kind of like a hey, you know, we let you in. You just need to like don't ask, don't tell. But, but we have a special program for what? You get to be a soldier. Lucky you. You get to go get shot at after we went to suck cock on video. What a fucking gift. Listen man, I think they'd probably kill you. I think they'd probably say, listen, we're going to do some gay. Porn is going to be crazy. It's we're going to pretend it's Osama bin Laden, or Saddam was saying or whatever. And I met this guy, doesn't even know he's doing it for the military, thinks he's doing a Persian look. They shoot everybody in the fucking head and throw them in the ocean and they just disappeared. No one ever hears about it. That's fucking fucking surrounds Zmq chicken.

Speaker 3:          01:36:22       Alright everybody out. You know, this general that just stepped up and said all kinds of crazy shit about Obama. And you know, there's Tris I think is, I don't know what the fuck his name is. He, um, they just made them resign. So he resigned. It turns out this is the same guy that signed off on the Pat Tillman story. He was trying to get everybody to believe it's Pat Tillman was died by the fighting the enemy when actually was killed by friendly fire. Same fucking dude. He's an asshole. He's like, he goes over there, it basically tells the troops, uh, this is going like shit. And it's like you're the guy who came up with a plan, who you blame him. He, there's a lot of speculation. I always listened to Opie and Anthony today and people were calling in and talking about it and they were saying that they think that he might have tried to, uh, he wanted to leave and he, this was the way he could not just leave but leave and get his point across, you know, that he calculated this and did it on purpose.

Speaker 3:          01:37:07       So he made this big statement about them because he knew it was going to be in rolling stone and then he gets fired, right? Or gets forced to resign, but then this issue, whatever he said, gets out there across the whole world because of the fact that he opened his mouth and in rolling stone and that they reacted and that they fired him. This becomes an issue that people want to hear more about. So then he gets a fucking book deal and he'd get a book deal for several million dollars. If you're fucking smart, he'll be on Fox News. If it's legal. I don't know what the legality is as far as like what you're allowed to talk about when you're allowed to talk about it. When you're a high level military guy, you know, in the United States army like he is, but I would think that that would be a fucking smooth move. You know, when you think. I mean, why just fucking quit? You don't like it. You don't like Obama. Why quit? Why not just make a stink mega stank? Everybody knows you made a stink. Write a book, Bam sign. You know, just need a little fame baby. Keep that ball rolling.

Speaker 2:          01:37:56       Well, I mean look at Sarah Palin. Exactly. I was just gonna say that still in the game. So on that fucking election was two years ago. She was retarded. Then she's still in the mix, making millions, making bank. They're doing some crazy reality shows series on hers, like eight episodes for a million dollars a pop. I'm a POW POW, POW.

Speaker 4:          01:38:15       That's why she got out. She like, I can't get money in sign raking day in Alaska. I did.

Speaker 2:          01:38:21       There is money and keeping the retards happy. She is the politics version of pro wrestling. If you go to watch pro wrestling, there are thousands of people in those stands and they're having a good fucking time. That bitch is the. She's a female politician version of a pro wrestler. She says a bunch of retarded shit that only retards agree with. She riles them up. They don't even know what she likes. They know what she stands for. She stands for someone who's not going to think too much sense for someone who's going to give basic values. We're just gonna. Get down on how's that whole hopey, changey thing working out for you. You know she. She prides herself on being goofy and people like that shit. They connect to it and you're always gonna. Have that man. You're always gonna. Have that. You're always going to have someone steps up like that. You're always going to have someone to. If you, if you all have to do is just get yourself into the zeitgeists. Get people, start thinking about you and then keep going and you can make a living off it. Man, they're fucking professional trolls.

Speaker 4:          01:39:16       Tomi, me and cultures, not a professional troll right on TV. I want the bone or. Dude, did you really? Yeah, she's actually looking pretty hot. Oh, Sam triply. How long does it. I want to fuck the right out of her now. You need to start drinking again. You're getting beer goggles. That's what I've heard.

Speaker 2:          01:39:37       This is incredible. This really is true sex bomb. Those who complain, the military should make love not war. May Be happy to know that at least on one occasion, the military scientists were searching for ways to break down the enemy with aching desire, a sex bomb, or in saucier headlines, the gay bomb scientists consider developing a chemical weapon with Aphrodisiac qualities that would make the enemy soldiers hopelessly physically attracted to one another as to paralyze their ranks and destroy morale. Isn't that good?

Speaker 4:          01:40:07       Credible scientists wizard like some 18 year old guy from high school. I'm a scientist. I'm going to make some gay bombs out there. You know, that's what the Pentagon hires. It's not like they have access to the best sign, but they just said they talked about it. They didn't actually do anything. Listen to you, man. You don't even want to believe. I believe they actually tried. I do. I believe. I believe I don't put it past the Pentagon, but I also find it like if they even were thinking about that, they probably just said move. We could make a bomb. Maybe that's good. All right, that's cool. They'll try and say, hey, they're saying aphrodisiacs right. When they were together with men

Speaker 2:          01:40:39       and there was only men around, they wouldn't be able to help themselves. That's the idea, right? You know, look man, if you break down what sexual desire is, there must be some sort of a trigger in our brains for sexual desire, you know, whatever it is, some sort of a chemical trigger. If they can

Speaker 1:          01:40:54       mimic that and find a way to get it into people blast blasted out in a haze and you inhale it as you breathe and all of a sudden you can. Thing they would do though is sell it. The first thing they would do though is they would be making money off that like oil. Why would they sell? They knew as porn ever. Why would they sell it when they can make x amount of money from it? When they could use it and take over countries they could take over task to fucking countries. Okay, and why would you sell it? Because if you sold it then other people would have access to it. If you're going to use it. If the military is gonna, use it. They're not going to, you know, the military is not going to turn into some sort of fucking, you know, a vendor start selling some product.

Speaker 1:          01:41:31       You're going to have late night commercials. The theory that like the Samurais were the days. That's why they fought. So I got my tattoo on my arm son respect. So just don't talk because it has so much come in their mouth. That's why pirates pirates dress flamboyantly flamboyantly you know the word they're all gay stop plants on. Yeah. That's was wearing. Who the fuck else was wearing earrings and shit back then? Big Sashes and fucking pirates were super gay and flamboyant silk shirts. We're not taught. Vikings and pirates aren't the same thing. Sam, Sam tripling. They're both on both our Nordic warriors. They're not gay, they're fucking savages. They. That's why Nordic chicks are so hot because they raped and pillaged all the best ones. They took everything they could find. Just pure Alpha Male, Arctic lust, big fucking white Dicks of death, just plundering and raping across the world.

Speaker 1:          01:42:24       Big Difference between that. Pirates pirates are sucking Dick and wearing sashes. They got crazy fucking patches over their eyes. Rainbow Birds, birds, rainbow. What kind of bird? Look at that. Pirates are associated with parents. What kind of a dude walks around with a parent on shoulder? A gay guy is sure. If you see a dude with a parrot on his shoulder, he's. Something's happened to him. You know? Maybe a dude made him jerk him off once and he's fucking frozen patches. Hate guys do magic tricks at House parties. Ooh, that's rough. I just went to the best house party their day at South Park. Had a house party and I went to it. It was amazing. Dude, you have not been to a party until you've been to one of these south park parties. He ever been to one. Joe Did. They probably spent like maybe $10,000 on just decorations, like you walk in and you felt like you were in Moulin Rouge, like a circus or something like that.

Speaker 1:          01:43:15       They had fucking shooting galleries like a, like a carnival and stuff. Those guys really have it done. They're doing it right. Those south park guys, everything they do, I love. Every time they put something out on level of America up the movie south parking lot. They were opening for tool. What dvds they would run the a cartoon before tool came out. Oh, you're talking about the Brian Boitano one, right? Yeah. The Brian Boitano one was the first. Someone gave me that under the Christmas card back when I was living in fucking. I was living in Encino. He was like, God damn, this is funny shit. And then it became a show, but every one of them will have that vhs tape because he could probably Ebay

Speaker 3:          01:43:52       that. I might have bills y'all. I got a stack of old vhs tapes that may or may not be interesting. I found a few of them the other day, but I'm like, you know what? All this shit is online, so they sent it out as a Christmas card through paramount or something like that and not many people got that vhs tapes. I'm sorry. I fucking love the South Park movie. That was just genius shit. Team America is my favorite all time movie of all time I think. Yeah, tea. My favorite. One of my funniest, the funniest movie I've ever seen for sure, but the thing about south park was when Saddam Hussein, when they had Saddam saying being gay with the devil and remember he had a big rubber Dick and so funny that I saw that movie in a theater full of Mexicans when they called God the biggest bitch of a mall.

Speaker 3:          01:44:38       You just felt the room energy turn. They got mad. Oh yeah. Hilarious. Like what? They're did Mohammed, you need to get camp. When I was at that party at for a brief second, I'm like, Oh yeah, that might be a bomb here is that many people were threatening their lives. They really were worried about that. The people were threatening their lives because they were making fun of Mohammed. What they saying that the time square guy, it was something the time square guy sounds like he's retarded. You know, we talked to people that know bombs and understand construction of bombs and like this could have never worked. Like the whole bunch of things work exactly. Perfect in order. He didn't have any experience doing it, set it up wrong, you know, they're like, this is all wrong. So He seems like it's just a fucking retard that they had over there.

Speaker 3:          01:45:21       Disenfranchise God, losing his house, you know, that kind of a guy and you know, just wants something to connect themselves to something significant. So he decides he's going to be a martyr and you know, like when they came up to on the plane he asked them if they were FBI or CIA. He asked them what they were in New York, priests, New York police or CIA or FBI. What are you? He wanted to know. He want to know who is getting arrested bias. If you wanted to get fucking caught, here's a dumb ass. So I think there are groups out there that are trying to do fucked up shit to Americans for sure. There definitely are. But the thing is the dudes who are joining these things, they're fucking mess, man. Yeah, they're idiots. They're, they're either idiots or they're all fucked up or nobody's signing up to do this shit.

Speaker 3:          01:45:59       If they got it all together, you know, the key to making the world safe is not killing all the fucked up people. It's making sure that people coming up, get it together, do your best to make sure there's plenty of cool people do your best to make sure the kids are raised correctly, that you just set up good schools and community centers and do things to try to enhance the lives of children, to make them grow up to be more positive people. That's the only way to fix this. How are you going to do that when they just keep pulling money out of education? I mean it's like this, you know, there's not enough incentive to them. They're rich, rich people put their kids in private schools. So they look at, you know, the situation like this other people's problem, fuck them, you know, but it's your problem to manage those kids grow up and they're disenfranchised and fucking dangerous, you know, if your children have to come in contact with you now if you go to like places like Australia, Canada, where it's like one group of people, they seem to be more like a group.

Speaker 3:          01:46:51       Do you know what I'm saying? That working together and I love the diversity of America, but I wonder if that plays in, you know, it's Kinda what I was talking to you on the phone. Like when you send it like all the savages and all that stuff. Seminar on the way over here, we were talking about why America, we were talking about how great Canada is. Every time we go up to Canada, which I just got back, I was just, uh, this weekend I was in a three stops can. I was in grand prairie. I was in saskatoon and then I was in saskatoon. Grandparent in Winnipeg had a great fucking time. Man, shows are so much fun. I can love Canada. I love. Awesome up there man. Montreal was awesome. It's just like there's something about these people that are, they're so nice. It's such a great, like there's so much like on a, on the whole somewhat friendlier and, and in more relaxed than Americans. Look in their eyes. You don't see darkness. You see rainbows, Douche bags. You mean there's Douche bags everywhere. You know, I had a lot of douchebags in Winnipeg, a lot of hecklers, but they're just drunk and retarded. That's part of life. Whatever you. Whatever you did just made the static come back. I just moved. We got a rinky dink system here, son. Yeah.

Speaker 8:          01:47:51       Okay.

Speaker 4:          01:47:52       I shut my mic off and it's doing it man. So can't be uh, so uh, try to try to figure out what this is. It's, it's something over there because I was fine. And then you move that stand out as a stand, touching a metal. Try to get comfortable liquid. It's almost near the end anyway.

Speaker 3:          01:48:08       Yeah. But wait a minute, we can't just keep talking like this bro. We started it four slash 15. We got 15 more minutes. Don't turn my volume down. I'm just saying can hear my that twice. Don't be fucking with them. You sign it. Somebody should. I do. Should I unplug and replug unplugging. Implement. What to do, Brian.

Speaker 4:          01:48:24       There's nothing over there. It's nothing over there. Don't touch anything over there. No, no, no. Don't. I don't know. Yeah. It's something over in that mic stand or your mic. Because the only thing you did is you touched the mic. Stand it. Turn back those move. I'll just move. It's like some kind of done that

Speaker 3:          01:48:39       rinky dink. Fucking bullshit. If I was listening to this on an ipad. Okay.

Speaker 4:          01:48:43       Be pissed right now. Come on. We gotta fix it. Take, take. Take the mick out of the Stan. Turn off the mic so you don't blow everyone's ears. I'll unplug it and hit the mic. Stand on the ground. Not too hard or know that the Michael Stopped. No, because it's unplugged. You're unplugged it. So now I'll take that mic though and hit it on the ground. Tap It on the ground. See? It's bad. It's the mic. Uh, why? Why would a tap that? No, no, no, no. The mic. You know what? I mean like if it's a loose connection or something, so it's like blowing into the Nintendo disc control. Okay. You know, I believe it's something to do with that Mike or the cable that the link is. Damn it. How's it connecting brand? It's just gone right here. I've heard there. I did already. That

Speaker 3:          01:49:35       what you put me in another whole pulling out of the hole over there. It's

Speaker 4:          01:49:39       not that. It's. It has something to do with. Oh wait, now there's just no sound. Is that one one? There we go. No, no. Sound crackle. Say it's something on

Speaker 3:          01:49:48       that side where the mic is. Okay. Let's ignore it because knowing is for listening to this shit. These fucking faggots just talked about the sound buzz for 30 seconds and I think they can hear it. Only we can hear it because you're that much because the compression three years during probably blocks out that that had with the itunes. People are gonna. Hear this shit up. I'll try to fix it. Sorry folks. Very interesting. Well you were talking about savages. Yeah. We were talking about. This is what Sam triple and I were talking about on the way over here. We were talking about why is America so aggressive? And we're saying, well you think about it, just the people that came to America are the people that were so fed up with Europe. There were so ambitious that they got on a fucking boat and sailed across oceans to get over here.

Speaker 3:          01:50:31       They put themselves through serious, the most aggressive of the aggressive and once they got here, you know, they were desperado and a lot of them got here during the depression or before the depression. You know, a lot of them got here back then and those fucking people do. The people grew up in the depression, you know, they had a fuck. They were fucking hard people, man. Those were hard, hard times. You hear stories about soup lines and whole families being outside and you know, I mean you see some of the photos from the, from the depression era. That was scary, scary shit for people. So those people grew up hard and they grew up aggressive and those are the ones that stayed and they had kids. And then they had kids and that fucking aggressive, aggressive attitude of survival. It's still still there. You know.

Speaker 3:          01:51:09       And then that's one of the reasons why we've talked about this before about California so weird is because all the people that were dissatisfied with the east coast, they're all slowly made their way further and further and further and further west. And you mix them with people just want fame and they know that the most aggressive be aggressive. La has got to be the freakiest fucking place to live ever. I think it's gotta be like Hollywood Wall Street and then Washington dc because you just see the um, did you see the, the Laker game thing, but they were lighting. The car's on fire after it was over. Yeah. They're so angry about that. And it wasn't even like a cop car or a government car. It was a fucking cab. And you know what I'm saying? I'm not going to go there. Nevermind. Go. Where am I?

Speaker 3:          01:51:50       Look, there's your fucking retarded. It doesn't matter what ethnicity they are from anybody who does. That's an idiot. And like I said before, why are they idiots? Why didn't? Because they were raised by idiots for sure. They're not doing that because that's human nature to do it because they're there. They're born into a fucked up situation with a ton of struggle by a bunch of people that can't cope and doesn't, don't balance things. Right. And you know, born into poverty. Alot of them born into, you know, immigration situations. There's a lot of fucking stripe. You're uh, you're raising kids right now. Uh, do you feel like raising kids is almost like raising a wild animal almost where you have to like teach them, you have to almost house trained them and all that. So I know you don't want to talk about your children's not specific like that. It's much more different. It's like an alien. So like something that doesn't even know this world, you know, wild animal has their own instincts and you have to kind of tone them down. And I've had wild cats before. I would feral cats that were raised outside or they were born outside and they're wild man, feral

Speaker 2:          01:52:45       cats. Even when you get. I got mine when he was a kitten, he was only like two months old. He was maybe three months old at the most, but he was wild as fuck. I mean wild like hissing at you and fucking leaping, clawing the walls and Mon. I first got them. I'm a friend of mine that I went to high school with. She had a bunch of them in her apartment was like, there was a parking lot area and this female federal Canada at a bunch of kittens. So she decIded she was gonna catch the kittens and give them two houses and she gave one of them to me and so I took this fucking cat. This cat was crazy dude. I mean I'd never seen anything like it ever in my life, but I had a couple of days off work so I decided I'm going to have to get this cat delight me.

Speaker 2:          01:53:24       I've got this cat is going to live in my house. I'm gonna have to get this cat to be chill with me. So I put one of my bedrooms. I put a bed in it that I don't normally sleep in and I put some cat food in there and some water and I just slept in there, read books for two days and wrote material and hung out with this little cat until he became my friend, but dude, it was crazy. I'd pick him up. He would start purring and then I would put them down as soon as I put them down, go fucking crazy and run away from me and fucking tried to climb up the walls. It was like when I would pick them up, the warmth and the comfort in the fact that I was giving him affection, a keanu he could relax, that I was going to do good things, but as soon as I put them down, it's was like immediate terror, so it's nothing or nothing like raising a wild animal.

Speaker 2:          01:54:04       It'S like raising something that doesn't exist and all of a sudden it gets brought forth into this dimension with a completely clean slate. They have no knowledge of what's going on. They have certain tendencies, tendencies towards being needy or aggressive or tendencies towards being relaxed and they, their personality is definitely very and whether or not that's genetic, whether or not that's just when they were born, you know, what was going on, you know, with my wife's body, what was going on with her diet, but what's going on with their genetics was going on with, you know, the fucking solar system, who the fuck knows what influences behavior, whether astrology is really not. And then from there you just get this blank slate and you got to raise this blank slate. But it's really, it doesn't seem like the community, like, you know, like people think of it as like this burden, like, oh gotta raise this kid.

Speaker 2:          01:54:49       I used to always think that's probably what it was like that you have kids. Like god becomes a burden. Gotta take care of the kids, but it doesn't seem like that to me. To me it seems it's fucking awesome. It's like you're raising this new little loving creature, you know, this little, little, little awesome person that you love so much, man. Like you want to do it like you want to be with them. You never. It doesn't feel like a burden to me, man. It feels like a lot of fun. I mean sometimes it requires a lot of attention. It's tough to get things done, but it's fun. But it was also. I'm having a I, you know, I had a baby when I was 40. I didn't have a baby when I was 20 and broken, fucked up and confused and trying to make my way in the world. I had a baby when I was already relaxed, you know, I had a baby when are already had like a good healthy view of the world. You know?

Speaker 4:          01:55:32       I just recently got baby fever. I think it's the second one that got me. I'm just like, you know what? I'm done. I don't need to be hanging out at a comedy club at two in the morning. I don't need to go to a bar and rave with my glow sticks when you need to do it, you know, I just, I feel like I just want to sit at home and be happy. And

Speaker 2:          01:55:48       will you love pets? You love pets man. If you love cats and dogs, I know you do. You would love a human being. I think that would make great pets will make the world would be so muCh better if more cool people had kids, you know, we will. We would figure out a way to, you know, to raise human beings and have like generations that were really nice and friendly to each other. The problem was just too much inequality, too much inequality in the way children are raised as well. Too much, too many situations where people are like looking at people that have things on tv and go, why not me? Or they'd have things in the world that they don't have and why not me? What the fuck? And this too much anger and you know, I mean, and that makes her competition in certain in some ways. You know, you See things that other people have you wish and wish you had and it forces you to work harder, but it's also a developed a lot of stress. There's a lot of.

Speaker 4:          01:56:34       Yeah, every time I think about it then I think about like, oh wait, when she's like, fucking 14, 12, 11,

Speaker 2:          01:56:41       do that. We know how creepy they are. Think about some guys that we've, we've come across in our lives and how fucking nutty there are. Especially should fear. No really hate women. You know, I, I've known dudes that really have issues with women and when women would turn them down they would yell at them and shit like that. And it's really embarrassing and creepy to be around. And you know, you can think, man, that could be your daughter. That could be sam trip, lee's daughter. And some guy's yelling at her calling her a fucking cunt lesbian, you know, because she doesn't want his drink. No thank you. Yeah, you fucking cunt. Lesbian dude. How many of those guys are out there?

Speaker 4:          01:57:14       You know what's worse is walking through vegas like saturday night and just seeing like at hard rock and seeing like fucking like just two girls walking through this maze of fucking drunk douchebags vegas guys. And it is sad. They're like attacked lesbian. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:57:34       Girls go to lesbian, asm, I mean just total speculation. But I've met girls that go both ways and sometimes there'll be like lesbians for like a year. So it's just, they get old deed on douche bags. They just want some kindness in their life. And so they just said, let's just, I'll be your girlfriend for you. I'll be flowery. Eddie's a eddie dated a chick that uh, she, she moved somewhere and became a lesbian. Yeah. Like, you know, he was dating her and they broke up and she did it, a bunch of different dudes and this and that and blah blah blah. And then she just decided to take some time off from dick

Speaker 4:          01:58:05       fucking scissor for a bit dated. I hooked up with this chick and right before we had sex for the fIrst time, she's like, I just need to let you know that for the last five years I've been living as a lesbian. Wow. I'm like, oh man. Like I need this kind of pressure. When I'm like jackie robinson, man, I like, I get one shot and if I don't take care of business, nobody gets his dick. I'm sure. Was a good shoT. So it was awesome, wasn't it? Oh, fucking loved it. she wanted me to crying and she really wants you to choke her. Yeah, I don't like that shit.

Speaker 2:          01:58:35       She wanted you to choke her and she was a lesbian. She wanted the full mail experience, bro. You aren't bringing heat. She's crazy.

Speaker 1:          01:58:42       I crazy. It was a good though. Crazy good. Yeah. I like crazy chicks. Did I ever tell you about like women who were a little bit cross? I too. I, I don't know why I had a girl that a little bit and that's another, another connection. Like I talked about the foot fetish thing. I had a girl that I dated when I was 22 and 21 actually, and she was older than me. She was really kind of sexy and she had a wonky eye and that wonky I've like had like a thing about wonky eyes and so it was just a little one. She's going to try harder. Brian, you don't understand. She's aware that wonky eye and she's just going to give a little bit more zest into the kiss. I just met this asian chick awhile ago and she had the greatest body and a little bit cross. I might. it's really hot. Yeah,

Speaker 4:          01:59:25       I went. I agree. I once dated this girl, I don't know if I'd said this or not on the podcast, but I once dated this girl that every time she would have an orgasm she would have like a full on seizure and fly off and hit bookshelves and knocked bookshelves down and stuff like that and ever since then I've been hoping that I get to find another girl like that because you don't understand how fucking amazing night is like you were about to. You're having sex, you're both to come and then she comes and she's just flyIng like a flopping fish all over the place and it's just like, well, should just putting on a show. No hurt herself doing it. Like I fucked her. Make sure she's not just retarded. No, no, no. To think this is a girl. I mean she loves. She loves sex so much.

Speaker 4:          02:00:05       We did this move like we, it was when we used to work at this mexican place and we did this move called the don pablo. That's the place we used to work at don pablos and it was where we did buck to, but you know, take my dick and rapid between my legs and then pull, hold her legs. I saw that in a peter north video. Is that a real video? I don't even know if that was a real meal, but we used to call it the dom pop girls sucking it that way. That's what it was at it backwards. So yeah, like we're on top and I'm holding her legs, pushing the deq in while my dick's, between my legs going through her from behind. How dogs fuck is it

Speaker 1:          02:00:37       backwards? Dogs fucked doggystyle they get caught when they get stuck and they try to step off. You know what it's like. It's like when you're Inside of dudes guard and he goes for a leg lock and then you have to step over backwards and then you get into donkey guard.

Speaker 4:          02:00:55       Yeah. But so anyways, It was weird because it was just a freak. She saw she would fucking come and like the that it would take a minute maybe of her just sitting there going like, like screens.

Speaker 1:          02:01:04       No,

Speaker 4:          02:01:06       while she's shaking like consultants get annoying after a while when I was doing it, but now it kind of like a fed. It's like I want it, I want to do that again. After a while we like, will you just shut the fuck up? I just got like water while she was doing. I just like walk up and make sure she didn't hit her.

Speaker 1:          02:01:21       I used to date a mexican girl. Ucl. Racial slurs at me in bed for real. Yeah, it was really hot. Wow. I don't know why. I just really like would be kind of high racial slurs. Like what would she say? Everything. Like what you might bitch motherfucker. She dropped the inbox. I'm really well. How would she use it? Say what she's saying. What the fuck? This is the podcast one. There's thousands listening to this right now. Tell us what the fuck she would say to just be like, fuck me. Fuck me nigger. Man. It's not you saying it. You know, but we all know. We all know what triply this is sad to me. Why? Because you're supposed to say It man. But tell me what this bitch was saying. She gonna drop bombs. Dude. That's great. Do you get to make your dick look a little harder?

Speaker 1:          02:02:06       Cruisy pitch? Yeah. I liked it. Fucking crazy pitch. I like it when girls talk. I did. I love. I want to get offended when I have like, I want her to say offensive shit. Wow. I like that. Hate that quiet shit where there's. But see I don't like saying shit unless they are. So if they're not then I don't say anything. I tried to make no noise at all, but that's awful. No noise at all. I'm just like, oh, you know, I'm not doing anything like that. That sounds like nelson reilly. Oh, Charles Nelson reilly is exodus. terrific. This was awesome.

Speaker 1:          02:02:52       Yeah. You don't make noise, man. No, I try not to get caught out on it. Sometimes you get called out on it. Yeah. I get called out on. It was so quiet and I'm like quiet girl who would just explode down there? Oh, me too. Oh yeah. Love question. You could always tell when she warm. It's so great. you oversee it? Spray out? No, I never really wanted to see it. I just felt it felt it one time. God let us hold on to a girl that did that. He goes, but it was inconsistent. One day be lIke fucking mint juleps the next day. Be like gatorade. I don't know what to fucking expect. It was still confusing. It always collected my belly button and then I used to just lay there after sex and like flick my finger in my belly button. Gross for me. The fuck out.

Speaker 1:          02:03:42       Weird cock sucker. I want some chicken in the back of a phantom. You boldly chicken the back of a car like a rolls royce. Oh shit. Yeah, dude, I did this gig in this. I was working with this guy. Bang some rich guy's wife. No, I just. This chick was running, running with us and she just, I'm sitting in the back of car. She just all over me and then like everyone leaves car just hanging out and I just start nailing her in the back and I'm just instead of answering next time, just go like this and they continue to store. Just ignoring what the fuck you're saying. by the way, this podcast is sponsored by fleshlight? Yeah, by the end. We have to say that at the end, how much is a phantom cost? Rose was a half a

Speaker 2:          02:04:38       million bucks or something. Dude. It was real deal shit. That's like one of those ultimate philosophy things like I'm sure it's cool to like drive around in must feel like really sturdy. I mean they're like really, really well made, but that'S just like an ultimate. Like flossIng moves those. That's what those cars like, you could run those into a building and you won't get hurt. They're built to like, yeah, they're awesomely built, but it's like also like the people that want them. Like that's an extreme statement, you know what I'm saying? I think this guy was a limo driver so he was one of the cars that. Oh, okay, okay, well and still you want to show people was the shit. Act forward. See what I get when I go out for my limo. And it was fun.

Speaker 4:          02:05:16       Just spray and he's like, please, please, please. And then they had a mercedes. They're grower to the mercedes. So we went over to the mercedes and finish what we were doing because she is splattering all over your seats. Oh yeah. He didn't want us to ruin his. oh wow.

Speaker 2:          02:05:31       That's great. She a sprayer. Yeah. Oh my god. Over the imagine if the back of his fucking beautiful car to smell like pussy, just dirty, stinky pussy everywhere.

Speaker 4:          02:05:43       I missed it. She loved it and asked him. Oh, ditching. Yeah. You ever meet the chicks who love it in the ass? They're pretending to love it in the ass. Never met somebody that loved girls that say they love it. They love it in there. I've heard girls yell it out at a comedy club. Some people, it just depends how like some people have whatever that that sensitive ass hole where it feels like a a. I can have orgasms from it. That's how much how sensItive it is and other girls don't have that vein or whatever that goes through the side of it. That's a doctor talking right now. Just dr red, that's ghetto daca. Yeah, you cut that vein is all about sex. You get that?

Speaker 2:          02:06:21       Dalai lama's antibodies sucks. So he's anti gay sex. I guess he's not even. He's anti blowjob too, so he is the anti gay sex. Most of the sexual only be used for procreation. Oral and anal is sexual

Speaker 4:          02:06:33       indiscretion. I mean most of the year, like in christianity, all the taboo. Sex is our. Don't create more christians, but who support? Supportive.

Speaker 2:          02:06:41       Why more gay people in the dalai lama, the dalai lama is essentially saying that what they're doIng is they're doing is unnatural and is a. Is not what you should be pursuing. You should only be pursuing pursuing sex. that creates babies. That's literally what he's saying. That's. He probably doesn't get laid that much at all. How about ever me? Maybe he gets laid occasionally. I don't know. We don't know. Maybe. fuck Sharon Stone and flashlights. Fleshlight fleshlight. Send them an avatar. One. We need to figure out a way to get avatar on board with this.

Speaker 4:          02:07:09       By the way. They have clear ones. They have clear ones. I was like, oh man. That's like fucking wonder woman when she's in the. Oh yeah, yeah, totally miserable jet. Just look down and you see lIttle wonder woman interject. I like the idea of a clear one though, man,

Speaker 2:          02:07:26       because there's something serial killer about the whole rubber pussy that's the same car as an actual pussy.

Speaker 4:          02:07:32       Have you ever seen those dolls? They're like life real dolls. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          02:07:36       I thought about getting a gay one for jujitsu. I was already. That'd be the perfect thing to practice on because it's just like a real dude because I have a. But then I thought, how do you explain that away? I got fake jujitsu dummies in my garage that I practice on, like if I can't get to class and I got some shit I got to work on, I'll work out on the dummy, go over moves on a dummy because it's like it's above a dump. They make them for gracie jujitsu, but it's not as accurate as like a real doll. I bought a real dog would work better, but you know what, you should just get you have cast just to get it to put in your closet and look at it all. I would want to dude. Oh, skin tone. No, no, no, no.

Speaker 3:          02:08:09       Yeah, that's. I think the sign was tough. I heard drew carey at eight real dose. Really a shoot. Carrie's got so much money, man. Dude, how great is that gig? He's such a nice guy too, man. True. Karen is like one of the nicest guys I think I've ever run across. Always friendly, always a big smile on his face. I've never even heard of it being a dick, you know, just always like a fun guy to be around. Loves comedy, gives advice to comics. He was given advice to some fucking new comic at the improv the other day, not the other day. It was like maybe a couple months ago, but drew was there and there was some new comic there and we were all talking and the new comic asks a question and drew carey just gave them all sorts of information. Just write 30 jokes a day.

Speaker 3:          02:08:49       Just sit down and force yourself to write. Get up every time you can record your act. he was like giving them all this great fucking advice jokes. It's like if you do that, if you. If you do that, if you really dedicate yourself, you're going to have some gems. You're gonna come up with some gems. You force yourself to write something, you know, just sit down and write a bunch of shit like that. He's so right. He's fucking great advice, but the fact that he took the time to do that to some kids from Ohio, Ohio guy, that's where columbus, Ohio does have a lot of nice people. There are a lot of canadians in a way, a little less, little less cool. Chicks are great. I like Ohio tick's mid west. They've always been very nice to from stock. I do. I like thick chicks.

Speaker 3:          02:09:31       I like amazon's. That's why I loved Australia. Just amazon chicks, strong women. I saw. I read that on your twitter, right? They're all amazons and pregnant. Those are my two favorite things. Australia is a pretty awesome fucking country man. There's no religious guilt out there. You can do. I was doing. Jesus jokes are fucking great man. They're friendly as shit too. I got to talk slow though to like you have a really thick accent. I could do their accent is pretty bad ass. Their accent just sounds party because like if you had token like that might, you know like that's not like a guy who takes himself too seriously. That's the guy who's going to throw you another beer and then I was in sydney. It's pretty expensive over there, man. A little bit. Cindy's the shit though. Todd's fucking. They're removed from everybody, man.

Speaker 3:          02:10:14       it's hard to get shit over there. Our driver was telling us how much cars are there. They're like real expensive because they got to ship them from other places they have like their own australian cars. You don't recognize like, what the fuck is that some weird alien car and shit. You know, they're like completely removed from the rest of the world. They're fucking far away. And the crazy thing is that was a prison colony for england in england is fucking boring as shit. Rainy weather all fucked up. Australia is beautiful and that's a prison colony and there. So. Cool. How the fuck did that happen? I don't know man. By the best time. How long were you there for? Two and a half weeks. Yeah, Australia is the shit, man. Had a good. were you on a this week man? I'm doing my uh, naughty show to my own notes, right?

You know, we fucked me up and if anyone from flashlights listening get us more.

Speaker 3:          02:12:44       We need chris crystal. I emailed him yesterday to tell him that the flashlight has made it into my act. Now there's like I have a whole chunk on the flashlight and how the chunks. I think that's the best way to do comedy. It's the, you know, the guy who I really emulated. Where I learned that from was richard, jenny, because richard, jenny would write and he would write the shit out of a subject. Man. I remember I was always impressed when I would go to see him that this guy, like when a guy has just one thing on a subject, he brings up a subject, he has a thing on it, and then he moves onto the next subject. I always feel like, well, you just started toucHing on the subject. You sure that that's all the angles that are in that subject. I don't, I don't feel like I got enough out of that experience, but when I would go see richard, jenny, that guy would like write these big long word, but right when he thought he was done with it, he would hit you with more shit with it and it made it funnier and funnier.

Speaker 3:          02:13:30       More ridiculous as it

Speaker 2:          02:13:32       got along. So I learned how to do that from him too. Well, you do chunks to men. Electronic store guys do chunks, right? Yeah. A lot of guys from there, we have similar styles. You know, we'd go loose. It's not like verbatim same way every night because that place is like a chaos place. Yeah. You can't go up there and do a monologue. Nobody wants to hear that shit, you know, you're going to have to interact with people at some point. That's why hey, showcase. And I think showcasing for something Is just so not natural, like seven minutes.

Speaker 6:          02:14:00       Yeah. And just go up there and a to z and it's just like, that's not what I do. It's like I like to be in the moment, talk about what's going on.

Speaker 2:          02:14:08       And it's funny because kennison who was one of my favorite comics and I think one of yours as well always had that problem, you know, and it's a comedy store guy as well. he always had the problem where he said, it takes me 10 minutes to get cooking. I don't want to do like seven minutes. He got a problem and he didn't want to do. When the rodney dangerfield specialist on, he was like, wow, you know, 10 minutes. This isn't a lot of time. Like he had a concern about that, you know, I think we both have that style that comes from the chaos of that fuckIng crazy comedy store

Speaker 6:          02:14:34       I did, man. When I walk up on stage, I just, it takes me a little longer than everybody else. You know, when there's people who walk up on stage and they have a certain look, you kind of know what they're going to talk about. So people like our rem board, do you know what I'm saying? Like john gibberella goes up with a hat and he looks like one of the guys from south park and talks like this, you know, and it's like he's already kind of like already in. Do you know what I'm saying? It's about ideas goes up. He's hilarious rail fuck cock suckers. What are you looking at? What's going on here? It always takes me like a couple minutes. I'm fine with that now, but when I first started I was always get very, like,

Speaker 2:          02:15:12       panicky and then it says that's your set off in a bad direction, but you have this casual like you're, your act is like, you know, I mean, sam's one of the funniest guys I've worked with, he's really hilarious. If you haven't seen him do stand up before his. Have you seen him in toronto? You know, if you've seen them in any of the places we went to, you know, um, but you know, his act is, you got, you don't have any fat in your ax, you're not trying too hard a bunch of bits. You're not doing a bunch of shit. That's, you know, like in the beginning of your career, like everybody, like I had it. Everybody has it. You have a bunch of bits that you know you have in there just because they're in there, you should have probably cut them out, you cut all that shit out, you know, your shit is all like what you think is funny and how you look at things.

Speaker 2:          02:15:49       So when you go up there, there's no you don't like, like try to fake them out right away and get them, get them going. You just get into your shit. You know, it take your time, you know, it takes a few minutes. But once you get that rhythm experience. I love that though. I love watching the guy do that man. I love watching the guy like set up his shit and get into it slowly. I really get uncomfortable when I see someone like panicking, you know, when I see someone trying to hard or, or saying a bunch of shit that's not real, you know, or trying to force things don't eat, you'll feel that,

Speaker 6:          02:16:18       you know, man, I'll be honest with you dude. Like, you know, I love working with you joe, because you're literally the probably the only person that I can just do any joke I want unleash, just throw it out there and just go for blood and you just fucking just grabbed the wave and just go, you know, and follow up. I mean I've literally gone on roads with people and had to pull punches, you know, and I understand because

Speaker 2:          02:16:44       very similar though, your, your sense of humor, my sense of humor, a very similar so that when you're on stage and you're killing, you know, I'm laughing my ass off. So when I go on stage I'm in a good mood. Like I'm laughing. You know what I'm saying? Like I feel like, wow, it was a fun fucking show. This is fun and I just carry it on. They get rocked. If you don't have that kind of act though, if you have the kind of act that's like really, you know, like a monologue act or someone who's like more sedated. It doesn't talk about controversial subjects. The problem is once the cat's out of the bag, you know, like once you start talking about wild shit, when you're up there, the guy after you, it's going to be really hard for him to be like sedate. It's going to be really hard for him to be like middle America, you know, fucking now ready for letterman. You know what I mean?

Speaker 6:          02:17:26       There was a time when I used to struggle at their. John kept barolo because he was very mainstream, lovable, and I go up there with my weird stuff and you feel it, right? The. Yeah. And it's just like, whoa. Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa. We're just, you know, we've been. We like ice cream. Do you know what I'm saying? You can't.

Speaker 2:          02:17:41       You can't convert them yet. That's what it is. You don't know how to convert them yet, you know, or you didn't at the time. Rather. I used to feel that way about age agent mall. Ha. Jamal was joey diaz is kryptonite for a long time ago. Modular lego. That's a funny dude. He's one of those guys. There's a few guys where I go. This doesn't make any sense. How is this guy? Not a huge household. I'm with you dude. Squeaky clean. Hilarious, brilliant timing. Great writing. fucking super nice guy. Super nice friendly guy and here it is. You know, we knew him from the store. From what? Ten years ago. Here he is. He's not famous, you know, that's crazy to me.

Speaker 6:          02:18:16       I mean do people are like, oh ha. Jamal killed last time. I was like, tell me when he doesn't kill. That's why. Because he murders room

Speaker 2:          02:18:23       steward. He's. He was when we knew him too, when he was at the store a lot. Like in the early two thousands. He was an executioner. Brow. He would go up and we did a lot of the same material, but he would go up and do 15 minutes of thunder sun and it will be squeaky clean and perfectly timed out and you know, you would feel like, especially if you have that lag of loose, you know, dirty style where you're talking shit on stage, you'd feel like unprepared when you're gone, you know, because it's such a totally different style of comedy. Funny man. Yeah. You always wonder that. You know, there's a lot of guys like that. Man. I always talk about reggie mcfadden regimen fat and back in New York in the nineties I knew reggie mcfadden like 93, 94. He was a destroyer dude. He would go up squeaky clean, totally digestible for tv and he would just fucking crush. He was a monster man and for whatever reason it just never connected. I know he got on in living color like I think unlike the last season or one of the last seasons, you know, and he did a little bit on that, but for whatever reason it never took off. When I saw him, I was like 22 or something like that. When I first saw him, I was like, whoa, this guy is going to be a fucking star.

Speaker 3:          02:19:28       I'm like, this guy is so charismatic. His act was clean. I wanted to like, um, like he would be on stage. I was like, I was learning from watching him perform. Definitely, you know, there's guys that you've seen and you go, man, I learned something watching that guy, I need to be more, have more fun with this or I, I enjoyed that part about his act, you know? Um, what, uh, how come I'm like that in my real life, but I'm not like that on stage. I needed to learn how to be myself on stage. Like he is, you know, he was one of those dudes, man, he just fucking crushed, crushed. You would just be humbled. Like, whoa, that guy's good. And then for whatever reason, man, I just never fucking clicked. It never clicked. You know, you never see him headlining these big shows that you hear about at these theaters and shit like that.

Speaker 3:          02:20:06       I don't even know where he is anymore. I don't know where he is. Either used to do poppins and I was like, I don't know why this guy is popping and he's not really celebrity. It was always really funny, but no, I haven't seen him at the comedy store in years. Yeah. Yeah. He, you do pop ins. He had a little bit going on back in. Know he did a movie like a little while ago. Very funny though, man. Steve white. There's another one. Steve white. Steve white is fucking hilarious. Dude. That guy's one of the most confusing guys to me. That and I know he made a ton of money off real estate. He became like some crazy fucking real estate investor and I think he does like seminars now. He has a radio show for awhile there in vegas. Did he do that? I was funny as shit.

Speaker 3:          02:20:46       He's another guy. That guy should have been a giant. Should've been fucking headlining everywhere over the world. We're talking about a bunch of people that no one knows about. We're talking about comedy, but there's also something about what we knew about these people, man. Yeah, but they don't have to know we're talking about, but I'm listening to the little comics that we knew that were really funny and we're describing. I know a lot of people asking like, how do we know these people? Why would we care about this? Who are these people? Stop reading that man. Don't bring that up man. Hours, 20 minutes. Don't bring up negative shit. You're bringing up negative shit that these people are saying that they're not into it. We're talking about comedy and what's our history and to us it's interesting. People that are into comedy, it's going to be.

Speaker 3:          02:21:22       You're also putting on a show right now. Yeah, bro. I know what I'm doing, man. Stop this. Don't fucking tell me what to talk about. I'm fascinated by this. You're not helping. It's not helping bring it up. Negative shit. It's not helping. It's interesting to me and I think I want to give guy credit and I want to give adrian jamal credit and I want to talk about all these guys. They were fucking funny. Genius guys that helped us when we were coming up, you know, watching all these different guys. I think that's one of the most Important things about comedy development is being around a bunch of other really funny comedians, you know, and, and like feeding off of each other. And it's a blessing too because like being in la, it's like, believe it or not, the comedy level so high, he's like, you know, I go on the road, even if I'll go down to san diego or something and you see what they're used to seeing and they're performing at that level.

Speaker 3:          02:22:07       It's like in la, you know, you know, I had to either for god knows how many times they had to follow you at the comedy store and it's like, I can't fuck around with that. You know, all these other great comics. LiKe you see what you got to get to and where are you going to operate at? And god knows I had to follow a lot of guys too. And that's one of the things that mitzi shore a really helped me and a lot of other comedians with. She knew how to schedule guys, you know, and she always would talk to me about it, you know, and I told her, I said, you know, you really made me, uh, you know, you really helped my development as a comedian. She goes, I always nowhere and I pull it. Yeah. You know, she will put me over after murderers, man, martin lawrence and his prime.

Speaker 3:          02:22:42       He would go up in the main room and fucking destroyed. Dude. It was back when he had that. What was that movie that he had the concert movie of him doing standup, something run something crazy, wasn't it you so crazy or something like that. I don't know. Someone was brian. Anyway, he, he used to destroy. He would level that main room. Then I would go up and I was nobody and I wasn't very confident and people, as soon as they saw me, they would get up and leave. But how many times in my life, dude, for like the first year is at the store. Andrew dice clay pretty much bumped me every night. I know, man. It was brutal. Dice, dice. They were scheduled him before me a bunch of times or after hammer other a bunch of times I'd have to go up after him and I used to listen to his cds or cassettes rather.

Speaker 3:          02:23:28       They were cassettes back in the eighties to one of my favorite moments was watching him on new year's doing his nursery rhymes. Yeah. See that live when I grew up on that was like phenomenal. There was an hbo special that was live right from philly, wasn't it? Or he. Yeah, and then I saw them do it in the olr one time on new years. I'm like, wow, that's pretty damn cool, man. Dude. I remember working with him just being like standing next to him going, holy shit, this is dyce client. Yep. You know, to me it's like right there with kennison as far as like the Impressionable comics. I mean, you know, people say he's an asshole. He just hate comedy and isn't that I don't care. To me, it's funny, you know, I'm not looking to, for him to have the, you know, the best philosophy in life and teach me how to live my life, but he, he's made me laugh hard before when I was a kid and insulting people at the store.

Speaker 3:          02:24:15       How many times does he just started attacking dudes? oh, he texts his own fans are awesome dice. Hey, fuck you dude. He's ruthless. He's ruthless shitting on people he does not care to. Yeah. That, that comedy store environment growing up in that crazy fall. Eddie griffin, after he did three hours, I've seen that. I've seen you follow him. I saw you follow him at least twice after he did three hours and the people were just destroyed by the time it was over. They had nothing left in them. By the time eddie, eddie would start off doing material and then two hours in, he'd be like, the africans built the pyramids with sound. See, y'all don't understand. Nine slash 11 happened. There was gold underneath those twIn towers. Subway ran 24 hours a day. Like you'd like to leave you like, what the fuck is he saying now? I don't know what's going on. I think kat williams just came, took all this thunder and then, I don't know man. Well he had a problem opening up for certain guys. He's like, oh, but I think it was mike apps. I think you were open for he. He was opening for some guys and like they just weren't. Maybe it was kat williams. They were just not into a shit man because he's got that style that

Speaker 2:          02:25:24       just shit talk and style, you know, he's like suited to. I think eddie's like at his best when he's like in like the oh are and it's like a friday night and they don't expect them and he goes out, but he's feeling just perfect. You've got to just the right amount to drink and just the right amount of feeling good and he'll go up there and fucking slay it. But do you remember back when he had his first hbo appearance? Now he's like a young comedian specials or something or def jam maybe it was deaf jam. Yes, it was deaf jam. And he fucking destroyed 80. Griffin was one of the most fucking charismatic and powerful standups ever for like a short period of time you would go to see like his, his like hbo performance when he was on def jam at the time. But the impact that it happened, I remember watching it being like, whoa, this guy's fucking talented. Just powerful and dynamic and all this energy and woo and good man. It was good fucking material. But somewhere along the line he just went crazy.

Speaker 6:          02:26:18       Yeah. I don't know what did do three hours and 45 minutes of it was gold. There was some really funny as shit. He would say shit. Sometimes it would make me go. This guy like in spurts is like one of the funniest ever. One of the funniest ever. Do you ever heard his bit about Alexander Graham bell is do a bit about cocaine. Then Alexander Graham bell invented the telephone. He's like, you gotta be has motherfucker want to talk to someone who ain't even there. That's funny. Shit. How much coke you got to do before you like, I want to talk to some nigga. Ain't even here. It's a funny bit, man. He had some funny fucking shit, but it was bursts of it, you know, bursts of genius followed by all this time. I just think like in la, like when you're doing like a set psych, people can only take so much and like three hours.

Speaker 6:          02:27:07       Nobody could take three hours of anybody. I don't think anybody. Would you ever want to hear anything you think about like these chappelle in these dane cook sets? What do you guys think about those sets were dudes do like six, seven, trusting. I hate it. I think it's the worst idea ever. I think. I think less is always more. I always found it interesting that date that dane always got like a bad, you know, energy from that. And then for the longest time nobody cared about dave chappelle. No one would ever be like fucking chappelle bummy. They'd be like, yeah, chappelle went up to three hours. it was awesome. Well, he seems now it's kind of changed, but at the time

Speaker 2:          02:27:42       time, like ran up to the chappelle show, especially after he left, he was like, this martyr for comedy. You know, because everybody had heard that like the comedy central suits were fucking with his show and trying to get him to stop saying nigger and trying to sell more advertising and they wanted to kill them more money. There's a big $50,000,000 deal and he just went fuck you. And walked away. And I think everybody just, he became the messiah, you know, every comic was like, wow, that guy's a real fucking comic. Like he really walked away from $50 million dollars. Who the fuck walks away from $50, million dollars? Who gets in a fucking plane and just goes to africa? So for us, like he embodied everything that a real comic is supposed to be. Dude's a genius

Speaker 3:          02:28:22       comedian. Hilarious as fuck. Had the funniest show in the history of television change. Did it change the way people thought? Yeah, I mean it was that. I mean like stuff that he did on the show became part of the lexicon. I'm rich bitch. How many people just would yell that out? How many people yell out fuck your couch. You know how many people would yell out all that stuff? That stuff became. It just, it just, it had an impact that nothing else did, man. And so when he stepped away from that and everybody was like, wow, he really doesn't give a fuck. He was mad at him at all. I always wonder if like, you killed like the golden goose. it was all fake. No, he can sell so much, man. He can do whatever he wants. I don't think he gives a fuck. If he wanted to sell out stadiums, dude, he could sell out stadiums.

Speaker 3:          02:29:08       He's not trying. He's showing up at comedy clubs like unannounced and shit. He's showing up and doing guest spots and shit and going up for a couple of hours here and there where he's not even like having people pay to see him. He's not doing that many real shows. He's a, an interesting motherfucker man. Very interesting. But I think that's really why everybody doesn't care that he goes up like we all want to see him. You know, he represents to a lot of comics, like he's the embodiment of what you're supposed to be. He's like the richard pryor of our generation. Yeah. The guy who goes up and everybody wants to sit and watch them, you know? Is he your favorite comic? Who's your favorite comic? Uh, I have, uh, uh, david tells one of my favorites. I just love the way he writes in.

Speaker 3:          02:29:46       His tags are really good. I like, uh, you stand hope bill burn and you know, nick swardson I think is really fucking funny. His specials, one of the only specials I like for some reason I can't watch comedy, man. I don't know what it is. I've been, I dunno man. So I'll watch like clumps, but somehow I got through his whole entire special laughing my ass off man. Yeah, he's really funny dude. That fucking thing that he does what he said, if I was going to commit suicide, I want everybody to be really confused after it was over, like pull out a gun and go who fucking farted brains out. That's hilarious. Shit dude. And he's goT great stage presence and delivery. I was in minneapolis and he was there too, is when brock lesnar was fighting and uh, it was the night before we did a show at the fine line music cafe and swarts and came to the show and he just walked on stage while I was on stage and he's, he's like one of those dudes who like, I love him so much.

Speaker 3:          02:30:45       He's so fun to be around. I'm always happy to see him, like one of the few dudes that would show up and then just walk on stage. I just give him the microphone and give him a hug, you know what I mean? like I'd be happy. It's like a for him it was like, it was like a cool thing on stage. He's a great guy, great guy. I used to do beecher's madhouse at the hard rock in vegas and he came out and party one night and then he just disappeared. He showed up the next day and he's like, I'm like, where'd you go? He goes, you don't want no, and I'm like, you know what? I felt so fun, dude. Man, he's a great guy, but he's one of those guys like he could probably do that to you. He would go onstage and you'd be happy to see them on stage with you.

Speaker 3:          02:31:21       Like, oh yeah man, but how many guys are like that? There's so few. You know, I don't know anybody who I would be comfortable going on stage on their show. I don'T know anybody who walks up. He's like, what the fuck man, I would never do that with you. Like if you were doing a show somewhere and I came to watch, I would never go on stage and just assume that we're going to give you the microphone. I'd start talking to be like, dude, what the fuck? You don't do enough shows. Yeah, come steal my thunder mother fucker. You happened to jen kirkman. She's a comic. Last night she went off on her twitter because she had a 30 minute spot at the improv and somebody went on stage. She didn't say who it was, jumped on stage and didn't, but she was going crazy both on the, the, you know, the improv, the emotion.

Speaker 3:          02:32:05       But you read her shit, jen kirkman, you agreed. I don't know. He was a contestant or you worked for last comic standing, but she never said she wouldn't say who it was. greg giraldo? no, no, no. It wasn't great. So how much time did they do? I liked, I don't know. I don't know, but just to check our twitter. It's pretty days on that show, but I like trello. I looked up to. That's life man. You know comics are going to go on before you and bump you especially. No one knows. Who the fuck are you?

Speaker 6:          02:32:28       I'm so numb to it, man. It's amazing how everyone gets so angry. I am so numb to getting bumped

Speaker 3:          02:32:34       test, man. It's a test for comics. It's good for you when you're starting out. It's not good when you get to a certain level and people are paying to see you and somewhat contrary to your point of view goes on and goes up. You know like, like you know what I'm saying?

Speaker 6:          02:32:48       Agreements. See story was headlining addison improv and I'm sitting there in the back office and all of a sudden I see brad williams walk and I'm like, hey brad. I'm like, oh fuck him walks fucking carlos mencia. He fucking does 30 minutes. I can't even get away from him and dallas does 30 minutes before me. Doesn't even ask me like, doesn't he? Hey dude, you mind if I do 30 minutes? Doesn't even ask. Just soon as he's doing it. Does it on purpose? He did it to put you in place. I mean, that's what he did this to. Everybody goes up there, right? I tell him, I go, he goes over 30 minutes. I ain't going onstage. He gets off at 27 minutes. He's killing. And he goes, thank you guys. So much. Place goes nuts. And they go, right? He goes, are you ready for your next comedian?

Speaker 6:          02:33:35       And the whole place literally goes like, someone's got filed this. This is crazy. I walked to the stage. He introduces me. I'm want to say he doesn't even wait for me to be to get to the stage. Literally. I've never seen anyone do this before. Runs a full sprint off the stage to the side, to his left leaves the stage gmt. I go up to make you feel uncomfortable. I get up there. I got this joke. I always drop when I fall. Big name somewhere. Drop it. Place goes nuts. I kill for 45 minutes. Like the crowd was like, we can fucking do this. You know what I'm saying? Money.

Speaker 3:          02:34:12       You know, they didn't know. They probably. A lot of them didn't know who you were. They were just going to see some comedy and they've maybe heard your name or something like that, but he was as national headline of go, just destroyed. Oh, in just trying to bury me. That's what he loves to do. he's a sick person, man. You know the mark marin podcast was fascinating. Listen to it because it was like listening to a crazy person. The crazy thing is he bumped marin. Marin was at the improv once. He bumped marin for like an hour. Marin didn't even say anything to them until the second podcast. You know, the first time he didn't bring it up like, hey, why'd you bump me for an hour? I'll fuck you forget that. See that whole thing about that video is man, it's like he brought that on himself to new videos.

Speaker 3:          02:34:50       The craziest thing ever. That's just flat out positions and that's where he is where you are. It's obvious who was on stage for. You know what I'm saying? It's like, I mean, you were there before you left and you came back, right? Yes. So he brought that on self. I didn't see what the situation of bullying or anything like that. That's his mare and being silly marries a contrarian. He's always trying to find some fucking unique angle that other people don't see. That's my biggest problem. So he's still, he's complained about, and I love baron, you can't complain about joke stealing and then he did a lot of dumb shit. Not only did they complete, this is what marin does. Marin compared it to people being influenced by people that there are other people that sound like people, which is. I've, I've been guilty of.

Speaker 3:          02:35:30       we've all been given. Yeah, I think everybody is, yeah, when you get influenced by people, but that's not. Plagiarism does a huge fucking difference between that plagiarism. It's a ridiculous comparison and the other thing that he said was that I thought was really kind of fucked up was like that, like he made it through comedy, did everything to comedy and just had a lot of hard work and he can't wait to take away the fact that he worked hard. Like what the fuck are you talking about? You're talking about a guy who's stealing and then he also said that he thought that the video should have been released, that we should have handled this within the community. This is all coming from a guy who's got a fucking podcast. We're four hours talking about it sounded like a 10 minute video or podcast talking about it on more than one occasion.

Speaker 3:          02:36:06       It's ridiculous. Silly marin's fucking karma, bro. That's what that was, man. Nobody wanted that to happen, you know? I didn't know. I just wanted him to not be there. I wanted him to not do what he was doing. We didn't want to set out to try to fucking destroy somebody. It was. We had a problem we had a deal with, but how, how bad was the store? How many times have you seen people freak the fuck out? Because that guy was in the back of the room. I don't do. I did. The funniest thing about him is like, he's so easy to follow if like if I actually did my material, it's so easy to follow, but you don't want to do your good shit because it was in the room. Right? So I just go to crowd work and sometimes it goes great and sometimes it doesn't.

Speaker 3:          02:36:47       I just, you know, that was what was missing from this whole discussion with the real problem with having something like that is not whether or not anyone's free of guilt. The real problem is what the situation is. As someone who is ruining an artistic environment and creating a bunch of stress and tension all for their own personal gain. And this isn't respected by the other people that are selling the art form. The people that are owning the comedy club, that people that are like the only reason why a comedy club is open, it's not just a place to buy drinks. It's a place to watch comedians perform and who you

Speaker 2:          02:37:16       got someone who's actively victimizing the other participants in this community that keeps you alive and you're letting that person for short term.

Speaker 6:          02:37:23       I don't get it. It's just they're not artists. They're selling art. They are not artists. They don't respect it the way an artist respects, you know, and, and you know, just things he said on that podcast in terms of just, you know, he sits still. He acts, he says he doesn't sit in a room, he sits in the room texting who you texting, your texting yourself. I mean it's like if you really wanted people not to hate you anymore, you would never go in the room when you weren't performing. I have this theory dude, like if if you're a guy who's been doing comedy over like 10 to 12 years and you're like watching like open mics, you're probably, they're fishing for material

Speaker 2:          02:38:03       or you could be a really curious person wants to see the beginnings again and see horrible failures and see like what it feels like to watch somebody like real nervous and uncomfortable to sit there the whole night and just be. Who knows, you know. I mean, I'm not saying that anybody watching an open mic night is definitely a thief, but suspect there's. You can get. You can cherry pick some great ideas that people don't know how to work in an open mic night. Right? I mean, how many times you watched an open mic night not micro go, wow, that's a good idea. He's not doing it right, but that's a great fucking idea of using go tell them how to tweak it. Yeah, that's a nice thing to do, man. I've had people do that to me and it's really cool when someone comes up to you like lucy kay was the last one to do that to me. He saw my sat and then afterwards he actually wrote a bunch of shit down and he gave me a couple of cool ideas. Cool. That's another thing. He's a great guy. He's, I think he's the best right now as far as like, he's the most prolific, you know, he's the patent as well. Patents and another one who I think is fucking.

Speaker 6:          02:38:55       Yeah, I think penn is very funny. I, you know, I have this whole thing about alternative comedy and I find it very funny because like the, almost like the mount rushmore of alternative comedy, which is like, you know, pat and sarah silverman, I'm David Cross and zach alpha nag. It's like they're funny people. They have set up, they have punchline. There is no alternative to it.

Speaker 2:          02:39:20       The exact same conversation yesterday for a long time. Like what is alternative comedy? How are these mainstream comedians talk about mainstream subjects and they do stand up comedy form. How is that alternative? Like it's, it's so hard to define what alternative comedy is.

Speaker 6:          02:39:33       I just think it's, as far as I can tell, it's a look now. It's like you have all five. Look, I don't because like I did the vancouver comedy festival with the vivid video comedy tour. It was me two porn stars and nerds. It was all nerds and I would watch like their sets and they talk about this shit I've heard everybody talk about, but they did it with glasses on and reading off a notebook. It's like the closest thing to alternative comedy might be a. Is it tim and eric's great show, good jobs. Those guys are brilliant, but they're not going for your normal like setup, punch. ThAt might be alternative kaufman this like they're brilliant to.

Speaker 3:          02:40:14       Have you ever seen that video? they did with that. I don't even know lord dale. Did you ever see that one? No. That's the greatest one of all time. That where the grinding and choking they fuck and it's all psychedelic and crazy neon jumping in fucking dude. It's amazing. humbling, humbling, humbling. That's like real alternative comedy. I completely agree with you. The rest of it is just like. It's like, come on, man, you're. You're onstage with notes and that makes it alternative. What they've done is they've created an environment where they can go with w zero performance. Yes, on purpose and they don't like people to perform, which is understandable. Some people like soft music, you know, some people like real calm, soft music, people like metal, you know, it's all. It's all a choice issue. I like all sorts. like I like jeff foxworthy, mankato crazy, but I think.

Speaker 3:          02:40:57       I think he's funny. Dude is funny bro. Yes, I think so. I could dig alan degeneracy man back in the day watching her specialty cable guy. He's got some great fucking jokes. I like a wide range of stuff. Some people get very particular about the comedy music, about comedy, about literature, about everything. You know, it's a lot of shit to enjoy, man. It doesn't. It doesn't have to be exactly your speed for you to enjoy it. There's a lot of shit that's good that doesn't necessarily resonate with how you would do it, but still I enjoy it. The only people that drive me crazy are the clean nazis. Especially if they're like the filthiest people offstage. Yes. You're making a business decision. that's fine. You make that decision, But don't get mad at me because I'm me on stage. I'm just. It's amplified, but still mia.

Speaker 3:          02:41:39       Yeah, I get that a lot. They like, yeah, they get upset at you because. Oh yeah. Talk about silicon cock. Too much hate douche bag. I think about that. All right. I'm going to talk about whatever I want to. You talk about whatever you want to. Don't worry about me. lee. Funny idea that there's something bad about swear words. It's so juvenile. All words are artificial. We make words to two so we can relay what we're seeing and there's all sorts of adjectives that are just as ridiculous. Like the idea that freakin is okay. Like creek clean people say freaking this freaking guy and they feel clean and free of any wrongdoing, but if you say fucking with the same story like seminar that you screwing up, that's so weird. Right? And if you look in like music, movies, everything else is so dirty now and now like there's very little clean comedy left though.

Speaker 3:          02:42:21       That's not, that's not very common anymore. There's the christian base as funny people of faith was a tour that was going on through the, uh, through the improv chains and it was at the, uh, Arizona improv comedy based on the bible and she does like arenas. Oh, that's hilarious. Yeah, I've seen guys do that too. There was a guy named brad stein who was really not very funny in my opinion, back in the day. He just was real hacky and just gross. Well, he became this like really right wing christian comic and just started crushing and like selling out giant places and some books and I got a cd. I bought it at a used record store just because I was curious. It was one of the strangest cds I've ever heard in my life. Completely devoid of like humor, but just like weird cheerleading, right wing god fearing cheerleading. Like

Speaker 6:          02:43:12       it was so bizarre. But I always laugh at those people because eventually they be, they're human and it catches up with them while they start banging chicks and ted haggard. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Who's that? who's that one priest right now that's from a. He's in houston. He talked like this and he's like, he plays like a stadium is churches like a stadium? They have a lot of those in Texas. Bands believe in everybody and it's like, dude, I'm like, I look in his eyes. I go, that guy seen darkness. He's selling something, but there are some darkness lurking, bro. Ted haggard pulled it off for a long time before he got busted. Who knows how many guys are out there that are going to get caught that george records. God, that was the head of the christian ride. He was a right almost. Yep. Joel olsteen dude, that guy and I hear he's a nice guy, but through there's darkness lurking, bro. My tivo records that guy every week and have no idea why. I just started recording it, so I'll sit in bed and just watch it sometimes just out of curiosity and that's it shits creepy. The lord. Your life son need to load in your life and his wife's got that big hair and big makeup. Crazy shit, man. It's so interesting because they got that crazy politics, but they're the funnest people. The party with the best

Speaker 2:          02:44:27       drinking, drinking in dallas, drinking in austin. True. You can find some great drink and partners in austin and have some fucking fun.

Speaker 6:          02:44:33       Yeah, man. let that pot's illegal. Man. You get fucking thrown in jail for pot there. It's so stupid. It's a. They got to fix that. It's Texas. Texas should be sucking the fucking corporate dick of America like that. Texas is supposed to be the only place that can like. Isn't this supposed to be legally able to secede from the union because it's a republic of taxes or something crazy like really religious and and big business go hand in hand. You know what I'm saying? Well, I do know, but it's so funny that people, reagan, reagan in the eighties

Speaker 2:          02:45:03       did everything wholesome to religion and you know the whole right wing religion, christian, christian movement really got involved in politics during the reagan era. they realized they could tap into those dummies and start selling them shit. Selling them god, god, guns and country. And I just pushed it and ran with it. It's so amazing. It's amazing. It's amazing because they are the people that give the fuck the least about the common man. You know corporations over the last terminators.

Speaker 6:          02:45:26       did they really are? Man. They have. They do not care. My attempt trIply. This is an epic
