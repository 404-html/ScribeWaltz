Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Uh,

Speaker 2:          00:00:03       you freaked bitches. We're back at it again. I thank the baby Jesus. I worked my fucking volumes on. Of course. I've only been doing this for three years through a laptop. Some low tech Shit's not gonna. Look at a circuit board that I don't understand. It's a simple stupid fucking mute button and I never push it. This episode of the Joe Rogan experience podcast is what does a professional mean? That's like as professionals, I get sort of kind of like the fake professional voice, but not really. Um, what brought to you by taking A. I had a dude on my message board that always on the mixed martial arts, a message board that said that he went from a 90 something dollar verizon bill to an $18 bill with the same use. If that's true. That is true. And I'm, I'm paraphrasing the numbers. I don't remember the exact numbers.

Speaker 2:          00:00:51       I should probably look it up. I would say that that's. He barely uses this phone if that's true. Well, I don't know man. You know, he said was it, was it the same use? Um, I don't know. I don't know how much you would save, but I know that I've gotten so much positive feedback about Tang and joey's been a loyal sprint customer forever. 10 uses the sprint backbone with ting is is a, it's a cell phone company. The way they do is essentially they by cell phone time at a, um, at, at sprint and they sell it to you. They sell it back to you, but they do it with no contracts and they sell like the coolest android phones that they have. Which part of the way did you just see this new fucking thing that they're going to release the facebook phone?

Speaker 2:          00:01:32       No, the Samsung is going to release something called the Galaxy Mega. No. Holy Shit, dude. It's six inches. It's like there's two versions of it. There's a five point eight inch and a six point three inch. Like what the fuck are you talking about? That's not a phone. What am I going to do it? That's, that's, that's a half of Joey Diaz. Dick wanting to fit in your pocket. We'll, I can't. I don't know. It's nonsense. That's a crazy thing. I don't know what that is. I don't know what that is. That's some cross crossover world thing that you have to have a man purse to carry that around. Or a woman and woman would be excellent. If I was a girl and I had a bag, you know, girls are allowed to carry purses, which is so awesome. You know, there's one thing they have got us whipped with this society, not women, but society has got us whipped with this stupid idea that somehow or another a man is not allowed to carry a purse.

Speaker 2:          00:02:22       You know, back in the Robin Hood days, those motherfuckers had shoulder bags. Okay. You're allowed to wear a backpack. A backpack. Like I'm a fucking schoolkid. Nobody gives me a hard time with it, but if I wear a fanny pack, they will look at me like somewhere. God Damn freaking nature. I'll tell you folks, we got to take back the fanny pack. We're going to take back the fanny pack and maybe even introduce a fucking purse. How about them apples? Get yourself a purse, boys. Fuck it. Yeah, you got a little man purse. There's nothing wrong with that man. The idea that there's something somehow or another feminine or weak about carrying around

Speaker 3:          00:03:00       a bag is a perplexing aspect of this society. Ladies and gentlemen, it doesn't make any sense. We are allowed to carry certain bags. If you're carrying like a military style Duffel bag, that's fine, but you're not allowed to have a purse. You can't go through the airport with a purse. Dudes will laugh at you. Dudes with backpacks carrying duffle bags will laugh at you. If you've got a purse, we'll give you a scar, but it's fucking purse. What is that? A purse, Bro. You got to fucking put that difference between the fucking person. A backpack. What's going on here? Come on, man. A duffel bags. Okay, and I can't have a fucking purse. This is nonsense. We have subjected ourselves to some nonsense that we just have accepted over the years and now it's become culture. Brian Redbank. God bless you for breaking the mold. Young man guys.

Speaker 3:          00:03:48       Zantax keeps your Zantac. What is that context? Is that hurt from drinking too much? Heartburn? Medicine. You take heartburn. Medicine? Yeah. Oh Dude. Silly Bitch. I'm anyway tank. What Tim does is it allows you to, uh, first of all, if you go to Rogan.ting.com, you could save some money, save 25 bucks off their service, but what they allow you to do is buy phones, the highest end android phones and uh, and put it on a network, the sprint network, but cancel whatever the fuck you want. It's yours. It's your phone too. There's a lot of stupid shit that goes along with the cell phone contracts. And uh, one, one big one is the fact that if you, you know, you, most people don't realize what kind of deal they're making when they make it. But when you cancel, if you cancel you, you got to pay them.

Speaker 3:          00:04:36       You can't just quit because you owe them like hundreds of dollars. It gets, it gets fucking stupid. And if someone is in a position where $300 is like a make or break for the month for them and you really want to get out of your, you know, x cell phone, you know, eight and t, whether it's verizon, whenever it is you to fucking pain up you, you didn't really get the deal that you got is you're paying off that phone over a several year period or you know, over a certain amount of time period and they sort of add that to your bill. So if you just decide to leave, you didn't really get that phone for two 99. You got a $700 phone for to 99 because they worked it into your deal that you pay the rest of it over time. So that's what's going on.

Speaker 3:          00:05:15       That's why you can't just cancel and things like what kinds of stupid shit is out. Let's just cut that out of the equation. That's nonsense. This complicates things. Let's also have it so people can share time and then spray it with. One of the coolest things about using the sprint network is it's not like Tang has its own little funky network that only works and like weird spots. It's a, it's a huge network that works everywhere and the waiting has it set up. If you don't use all of their, all of their bandwidth. If you don't use all of their, you know, all of the time, rather they'll give you a credit on your unused service, so if you use less than you thought you would, tear drops you down and credit you the difference on your next bill. It's beautiful. I love it. It's just a cool company. I love the idea behind it. It would suck if it turned out they were actually evil and that they just like the most evil company ever. They're just doing it really

Speaker 4:          00:06:10       like a puppy. Yeah. They're all fucking devil worshipers or some shit.

Speaker 5:          00:06:17       I've seen the pictures of you and your six, six, six and your tattoo.

Speaker 4:          00:06:20       Yeah, we gotta talk about that picture. Huh? People think I'm a real devil. Worship really silly fox. I was at the Goddamn some Anton lavey thing. We'll talk about it.

Speaker 3:          00:06:28       Okay, we'll talk about it. Pull the picture up. We'll talk about it because it's so ridiculous. Anyway, Rogan Dot Tang.com. Save yourself some money on a cool company. And uh, you know, uh, I don't think there's any reason to have contracts anymore. Folks, go there, get your shit out, get your freak on or whatever. We're also brought to you by stamps.com stamps. Dot Com is one of our newest sponsors. And if you buy any of Brian's desk, squad dot TV, kitty cats, that is exactly how they're getting to you. They're getting you through stamps.com. So, um, you know, that, uh, Brian uses it. It's a, it's an easy way to, if you have a small business and going, taking your stuff, whatever you're selling and bringing it to some post office where you've got to wait in line, someone's going to weigh your shit and box everything out. It's a pain in the Dick and it's not necessary. Um, and stamps.com do it all. They give you a scale, um, they, they, they set you up, you, you print out the postage on your computer. I mean it's, it's a beautiful seamless experience. And Brian, you enjoy it, right?

Speaker 5:          00:07:35       Yeah, it's super easy and it's just not going to the post office is the biggest thing because going to the post office, I don't know how it is where you guys live, but in, in Burbank it's like an hour just to get to the cashier. She can give him your box of tons of stuff to send and it's a pain in the ass here. You just printed out and they have like, you know, different ways to print it out. They have like the sticker kind where you can print it on these stickers and the print outs just like it's a regular stamp or you could just put your envelope in there and a printed right on the envelope. I mean, ups. Yeah. No, no, not ups.

Speaker 4:          00:08:07       Oh, so you can imagine that's it. Not to take it to the box. Do you remember they came up, everybody knows that they're the biggest drug dealer. Mitch Hedberg is job. No, but that's a true story now, which become. That's how fucking insightful he was. That's the truth. I think they're getting all this weed. Anywhere you go. Now we've got Kelly wheat. It's not really Kelly. We'd people that buy it. They got. They got a good salesman. I wonder if it's the same chance or taken that you've taken with the post office because the post office, if you're like a drug dealer and you sent drugs through the mail, you don't think it's like a federal massive with Tommy Chunk, but it's. Yeah, but is it the same with ups?

Speaker 5:          00:08:48       No, I don't think they're. I think ups has a private company.

Speaker 4:          00:08:52       You're still doing something over state lines, so are still transporting. You're still going to jail.

Speaker 6:          00:08:58       Transporting across state lines is one issue, but then there's another issue I think is sending stuff through the post office. It's like they're like, listen bitch,

Speaker 4:          00:09:07       you fuck with us? Will you make us a part of your deal of bringing illegal shit places and where the government you can bold. Motherfucker know. So they, they went after those feeds. This is the thing in California. I know for a fact if, let's say you have a friend that calls and says, hey man, you know, we grew up together and everybody's out there and Kelly will pool and listening to Rihanna. Send me a bag of weed and the cooking. You do somebody a favor and get like a vhs box, but we sent it to him. He'll never get those mailman. I've had friends that said boxes got ripped open like a dog had gotten there with the address on the bottom. I swear to God and they've taken out of that. Send it like, what are you going to do that Hollywood post office on Wilcox. Don't you go in there every Filipino's high as fuck that place. Everybody. Everybody's fucked up. The trucks are crooked. They say this is this guy. Legit sent him a little bit of reefer and Eddie's book and he said the fucking thing got there. A month later, a month later, I bought like the three days a month later, ripped open with Eddie's booking it and they took the weed. Eddie's book got there. You can't leave anything to government agencies, man. The Tsa.

Speaker 6:          00:10:40       Look, I never complained about the TSA. The Tsa in New York was the rudest person, like the way she was communicating with people. I ain't going to do all that. You got. You got to give that to this. You got to move that over there. I haven't used in Tuzla to lions. He. I'm doing talented. JFK. Yeah. I was like, this is incredible. I was like, I and I, I go, you've been very hostile. She goes, no, I'm not, but I could get hostile. And I was like, wow. I'm like, people really communicate like that. Just flippantly with people in public that are in positions like the Tsa, like the way she was communicating with people but just like so short and so curt with people and so shitty just right off the bat is if someone was doing something to her by having her do her job, that's some offensive shit man.

Speaker 6:          00:11:22       When people get consumed with you, just because their job sucks. Like I get your job sucks, but I'm friendly. I'll be up. We'll we could have a nice little smile at each other and, and walk about, you know, go through this deal, go through our time together. It's not going to take care of the baby. And the extra time. Yeah, she just got conti just right away and it's a thing, man, there's a thing with people in New York that I noticed this weekend and I dot I forgot about, but there's that continence, that curtness that people have sometimes, but the real short with folks and folks are shortly with each other and I'm like, wow,

Speaker 3:          00:11:54       that's interesting. Because you know, when that went away, that went away after nine slash 11. I remember always thinking that New York was like, there was like a certain hostility to New York that I didn't appreciate. I thought it was an amazing, amazing, amazing city. It's so fucking crazy. It's beautiful. Monolithic. I mean it's like more beautiful than the mountains. Really. It's created by men when that motherfucker is lit up at night, it's more beautiful than even the mountains themselves. So I'm looking at it and I'm like, this is like really like one of the perfect creations by man as far as like one of the most amazing things that anyone's ever created and put on this earth. New York City's one of them, but you can't have that many people together. They just get. They get tired of each other. They get, they get shitty with each other.

Speaker 7:          00:12:36       USBS needs a warrant to open their mail, but ups can just open to whatever the fuck they want.

Speaker 3:          00:12:40       Boom. Supersede the government were contracting.

Speaker 7:          00:12:44       The La post office doesn't. Motherfuckers don't need nothing. They just need to whip it this nice to see you at the window and it moves the speed of light. I guarantee you there's somebody at the glass going, check that back. Oh, here we go. Look at his friend. Anyway, avoid all this bullshit by using stamps.com. Get a free scale scale. If you. There's a microphone in the upper right hand corner. If you click on that microphone, you enter in the code j r e and that code will take you

Speaker 3:          00:13:13       to the stamps.com website where you get $110 offer and a free digital scale. It's a very cool service and again, like I said, if you order one of those desks, quad tee shirts, that's a. that's how they're coming to you bitch new shit taken to the next level. Print new shed at home.

Speaker 7:          00:13:30       The interesting thing that the only people do it or in Kennedy airport, and I'm not angry, I'm not saying this is bad, let like let's say me and joe fly out for years. We flew out, we made it 15 minutes before the flight. That shit don't work. Don't work no more. So you and I have said, fuck it, we got to be that 11 will be there with that. Open up a computer each. You know, I went there and did that Kennedy one day and they're like, you can't go through security. And I'm like, you can't be serious. Like, no, you can't go to, we tell you. So they made me an army wait where they made me an army wait there and finally had the sleep apnea machine and I'm fucking hungry and if I get up at four and six and I haven't eaten my blood sugar goes, fuck it up and I get dizzy.

Speaker 7:          00:14:14       I get that thing that, uh, Dana was complaining about whether there's ear years, I get this feeling like I gotta Puke and I went up to Atlanta to go listen to it. I gotta go, I got sleep. That's the only reason they let me through. Why hasn't had the machine they would have held me there. And I was like, that's amazing. I go, well, because they know, you know, I didn't eat. I can't eat as soon as you fucking get up, you got to drink some water and move around. So what were they just hostile? Very, very. That's why as soon as you said that, I said Kennedy, Ted Kennedy. I didn't even know need to know. Newark is not like that. And look what is. I have never had a problem in Newark. And Laguardia Newark, I had the problem the one time when I took the phone up, the moon landing and the German

Speaker 4:          00:14:52       guy said to shut the phone off and he started yelling on the plane and then when I signed the cop goes, I don't know, you know, you're only away fucking team here. This is the home team day. You tell him to turn the phone off that Newark. No, I never had a problem in Newark. It was Kennedy and now you had it. And I've had it twice. Yeah, I mean I'm pretty nice man. I try to be as nice as I can to people when I run into them, you know, from talking face to face with someone, I'm going to try to be as nice as I can, but there's certain times where you get confronted with continence, which shittiness that people have and you're just like, whoa dude, you know, fucking relaxed. I'm saying the blow, especially in the morning, I don't like this shit in the morning.

Speaker 4:          00:15:30       I tolerated in the afternoon, in the morning, I can't. I'm like, we could do this with a couple of servers. And how you doing brother and everything will be fine and we'll have a nice little conversation here, but you're just doing your job and I'm just talking and we're just, you know, we're just two people running into each other. There's not, there's not conflict, you know, and like there's people there that have this hostile attitude. They don't like making it a conflict. I'm not here for a conflict of man. I'm just saying hello to people. Look at my bag. There's nothing in it, you know, I'm just going to go to my destination, take care. Nice meeting you. Good seeing. And most of the time that's what I get. Especially with the, uh, the, the x ray people, extra people or some of the coolest motherfucker shit.

Speaker 4:          00:16:04       I run into those people like the dudes that are working in security in those areas. They're always asking me UFC questions and always being friendly. I don't see them being shitty with people. I see a lot of them actually going out there with. It'd be nice to people. So when I'm confronted with with someone just being shitty right off the bat, I'm like, wow, that wasn't necessary. There was totally unnecessary. I gotta be honest with you, you and I and red band and this young man we're blessed with. Or have you want to call it that? We fly a lot. Yeah. I know that the recent conditions after nine slash 11 have stopped a lot of regular people. They don't like it no more. I gotta be honest with you. A couple of weeks ago you had people on here and I know you tsa. I have no problem with them.

Speaker 4:          00:16:42       I've had a problem with. It's not easy either. You go to them and your plane's going to fucking blow up that fucking simple. Okay. And when you know that we've met people, that situations have happened, they've gotten through the line and realized they had a fucking bazooka on their luggage. You know, that always scares the shit out of me. Bullets. Yeah. A friend of ours with the bullet, you know, that happens. But I ain't never had a confrontation with them. I've had confrontation. You know, people on the line. Sometimes are the worst people you have real slow when you go. That's my case. Like I had a problem and fucking someone vegas flying out one morning with some fucking guy that was 80 like, fuck you. Are you fucking serious? Uh, but no, no, no, no. I, I've never had a problem with those two years at all at all. It feels so weird. Then I do everything as they told me, the belt comes off your sweetheart, you a fucking case. I take the tube, I leave my vapor pen and I confused them with that. I don't know what the fuck that is. That's a lady I've never had a problem with. But uh, that, that, that particular, you know, you got to go to JFK. You did, you got it did sucks.

Speaker 3:          00:17:50       It's unfortunate. I mean it was only a couple of people, but it was just like, it was more than one. I was like, wow, this is nuts. I'm just trying to be nice, you know? Would you have a move to New York? I thought about it. I always think about it. Yeah, it's, it's kind of an interesting situation. We'll talk about it after we get done with. Oh fuck. Fuck all the commercials, man. I don't want to do any more commercials. All right. Dot, come to the last one. O n n I t you don't know what it is. Go Fuck yourself at this point. Seriously. Best commercial ever. Uh, what it is. Shit that's good for your brain and odd weightlifting equipment. Uh, one of the coolest things that we have now is the champ with the chimp Kettlebell that has the expression I like to describe the biting your Dick off face.

Speaker 3:          00:18:32       So if you see that that chimp Kettlebell data is the look that chimp would have right as it's biting your Dick off. And think about that while you work out with it and we'll give you some extra motivation and some extra strength after a horrible car. Fire. Oh Dude, that's so rude. That's a chimp son. Scariest fucking prime minister. The planet. And we're just lucky they haven't figured out how to use guns yet. It's crazy. Fox trying to keep these things alive. Look at that meet and looking asshole. Crazy smart ass hole that can kill you with his hands. Yeah. Why don't we have more of those? It should be just running through the streets. Oh my God. What we do without them, what we do. Without them, we'd eat the bananas. That's what the fuck we do. What's wrong with you? Chimps? Everywhere. What's that? You see that tiger up here yesterday. The Mountain Lion Yang. Glendale. Fucking what do. There's a lot of mountain lions lately.

Speaker 3:          00:19:26       We're always angel, Lindale right by a New York Park when they call it. I don't know what part of Glendale was, but that's not an immediate to be seeing that as the only way you get with her. I'll fucking immediate release one of those fucking leopards was this mountain line in the back of a white car driving down the street. You know it give us. They shot it on a porch. Second shot it on someone's porch. Oh my God. Yeah. Wow. That's who need a mountain lion Kettlebell. Just to give you. Just say you're fucking working out like that thing's going after the hardest domesticated. Oh, it's impossible. You can't get them as a kitten. Yeah. He never can really domesticate them. They never really domesticate wild animals. You train them and there's a big difference is that dogs are dogs, man. They've. They've been dark for so long.

Speaker 3:          00:20:10       Like you know, like, like my dogs. They're super friendly dogs, man. I never worried about them being mean to me. I don't worry about weirdness. I don't worry about them just flipping one day and ripping my throat out. But with a lion or something like that, that can happen. Mountain lions don't. You don't, you don't own them. Bitch. That is straight den. A killing, straight killing millions and millions and millions of years. Nothing but killing. That's all. It knows so much. Diane Sawyer and I see a bear wrestling little line. Is that real? He could be, yeah. I mean people have done shit like that. Like a monkey choking the bear, like hitting him in the face with left jabs.

Speaker 4:          00:20:48       They can do that. How come I can't train? They train them. They can see that one this week or with somebody. It was a mountain fucking bad. Big. They say about something, it was a leopard, a fucking bear, and then a third wild, like something that was so obscure like a beef, uh, like they're all playing and chasing a ball together. What we need, we definitely need a mountain lion kettlebell. That's for California. They have a mountain lion problems in California. I sold you. I saw, I went to Santa Barbara last week. How big? It was big, I mean big enough to kill you for sure. It was like coyote size, my fucking pants. It wasn't as big as the big ones. You know, they get up to like 200 pounds I guess, but it was probably like 70 or 80 pounds. It looked like a coyote. It was moving across the road and y'all coyote is like stiff, but mountain lions like bounce. They have like a bouncer and I just assumed it was a coyote because it seems wild animal running across the road. But then I see its tail and then put it together because you're looking at it, you know, it's a flash glimpse as it runs across your headlights. But it was probably about, you know, 70 pounds that, that, that'll kill you. Dental fucking killed this shit Eddie. I'm going to tell you was killing motherfuckers that snow in Colorado.

Speaker 4:          00:22:08       They take into deep April off. That's why Jack Nicholson snap, that's why in that movie that you could tolerate November, December, January. That's cool too. But now you're out of the weeds, you know, St Paddy's Day. You're like fuck it. Put away the boots march. And they dumped. Well how many inches have they gotten? A big blizzard though. Forty inches so often a month for the month. In total. I'm talking about they just locked the airport Wednesday, didn't they? Yeah, they didn't come on. Was tweeting about getting stuck there? No, they don't. That's why you can, that's a great place to live. If you got a fly in April, April, you have a pool going, the guys over putting chlorine in and all of a sudden I seen people with facebooking pictures. The light lights with six or seven inches. The whole town. White April. Two different kind of living. Different kinds of living.

Speaker 4:          00:23:07       You, you're dealing with nature on a completely different level than what is so pussified here in California, but we've got mountain lions pitch, we've got mountain lions and they're moving in. There's been more of um, I mean, come on, this is not, this is not a one time situation. They shot one in Santa Monica last year and then you've got this one in Glendale. They're moving into urban neighborhoods. They found one in my Monica last summer. We have podcasts. We discussed, found one in a gore. I'm recently out near Gora. They have their, they're seeing them all over the place now. What is the reason why they're coming down into the cities? Well, there's two things going on. I mean, I don't want to be ignorant about this. Stephen now will be on the podcast

Speaker 3:          00:23:46       on Monday, the hunter from that media to show and he'll be able to explain to us a little bit better, but I think there's been plenty of music, man. Let's fucking, let's do this actual podcast is ridiculous on a.com o n n I t use a codename on the podcast. Here we are, but we're not. It's crazy. I'm the audio, the audio version, so it's always the podcast. Amazing experience.

Speaker 8:          00:24:16       I just realized that I'm asleep

Speaker 3:          00:24:18       doing a podcast with that stupid song. What fucking difference does it match what I mean? You know what I'm saying? And now it's the podcast. What am I doing? What am I crazy? But the podcast just began a fucking half an hour ago. We don't need to play that Goddamn song. Yeah. The thing about mountain lions, Joey, Joey, Joey Diaz is in the house. Ladies and gentlemen, for the people we need to stop editing this thing to just fucking accept it. Serious can edit it. Everybody else can go fuck themselves. And that's really all that's happening, right? It's just a series. It's editing the first part of the commercials out, but during the commercials, sometimes the best shit we say, sorry. So if you listen to this on serious, he got to go, uh, go to itunes.

Speaker 8:          00:24:54       Maybe we should just mix the commercials in our woods, pull out like a cell phone. I'm like, Damn. It makes it like fake. Hey Brian, what is that cell phone you have in your hands and what? Tell me about ting. We should just do it once for fun.

Speaker 3:          00:25:10       What? Uh, the, the issue with the mountain lions where they're seeing more of them. There's one of them that cut a tranquilized yesterday in Glendale. We're talking about this. I saw one last week in Santa Barbara and uh, of course there was the big one in Santa Monica that they killed, which I think was about a year ago, but they're not using dogs. The hunt them anymore in California. They changed the regulations and when you changed the regulations, you're going to have more mountain lions, like it's still legal to hunt mountain lions because they're trying to keep the population under control. But by not allowing hunters, these dogs hunter say that's the most effective way to kill mountain lions and still incredibly difficult. What kind of dogs? They use hounds. They use hunting dogs and they, these specially trained dogs are designed to go find mountain lions. They find mountain lions and they treat them and then the hunter shoots him and that's almost the only way to catch these fucking things.

Speaker 3:          00:26:02       Okay. Because they are in the woods. Okay. When you talk to me about an intelligence like nature intelligence, their way fucking smarter than you, they know what, they're not going to get below you. They're going to stay above you. They know that it's harder to run uphill and downhill. The the like, they have like instinctual things that you as a city person that's wandering through the woods, you don't know what the fuck is going on. You know you, you literally need dogs to find them because they're too fast. They're just going to. They're going to hear you walk in and they're gonna be like, bitch, get the fuck out of their cats. Their big giant cats that are living in the woods. Can we have this weird attachment, you know, to like certain aspects of what shouldn't, shouldn't be legal when it comes managing

Speaker 6:          00:26:44       the wildlife around us. But you got to be really fucking careful about allowing predators to take hold. I mean you gotta be really careful because right now we're fine, but if the balance can shift and you start getting to know Australia crocodile situation where this place is in Australia, you can't fucking go because if you go you will get eaten by crocodiles. Like they will come and they will fucking get you and there's too many of them and you know, you just, you just areas of the water, you can't go there. If you go there, you're going to get God. It's just gonna happen. I don't find that acceptable. I just don't find that acceptable. I think the idea behind it is ridiculous. Ninety percent of everything that's ever existed as extinct 90 fucking present. I don't think there'd be any problem. We can't bear the crocodiles.

Speaker 6:          00:27:30       I mean it would be kind of cool to keep them around and look at, but if it had to do with like crocodiles overpopulating and starting to fucking kill people, you can't. You can't think about them as being like one of us. You can't think about them as being like they are part of nature now. That's a monster. Godzilla mountain lions. That's the wolf man, might as well get, I mean for mental health and gets you with the wolf man gets you. It's the same shit you just got got late night, night night bitch. One of those big cats gets you to shit. Fuck cheese. That's a monster. That's a God damn monster. It's a mountain lion and we are working so hard to conserve and protect these killers, these things that need to kill every day. These monsters that run faster than us, jump higher than us and only killed things with their face. That's all they do and they can kill you and even if you have a knife, it could still probably kill you. Even if you have two knives, they'd probably kill you.

Speaker 4:          00:28:30       Even if you're trained. They don't give a fuck. Kill you. That first lunch that they go that rips a limb, that'll you fucking. What do you call that vein? That starts bleeding? Cook, rotted artery, and they hit it from every angle, from every angle, the way they swabbed it. You don't get something done. You're done. And I'll tell you what, listen, you know what? The biggest animal I ever saw in boulder was a snake. Really right off hill road. I never seen nothing like that. Well, those yellow motherfuckers coiled like this thick. What kind of snake was it? I stopped and asked him. You know, I asked him where he was from. I think it was like fucking died. Someone's like pat that they let out, I don't know and the most likes on my father in laws property and he was. I was like, what the fuck? We had to pull over and apparently that's the thing they have a real issue with in Florida. People just take pythons but like this thing do big fuck this. They just throw it out. Fucking white people.

Speaker 6:          00:29:29       Crazy white people in Florida, man, I got me a pass on it. Won't see the rabbit. Come on to feed my sheep, feed my snake rabbit. And then all of a sudden you realize you've got a rabbit eating monster living in your house and one day it wraps around your arm and won't let go. And you're like, alright, I gotta get rid of this thing. It's 18 feet long down to the fucking swamp and just go, go be free. My friend. I didn't want to take it and kill it. I mean I knew it was thinking about killing me, but it's my pet. I had a connection to it so I just let it loose in the swamp.

Speaker 4:          00:29:59       I saw a homeless person walking down the street with a snake around his neck, like a big one too. Was his pet homeless? Got Snakes? Scariest thing ever. Yeah. Rap or roles.

Speaker 6:          00:30:09       Weird man. There's A. There's a weird thing with reptiles because they don't give a fuck about you. They never give a fuck about you. They're just conditioned to maybe do or not bite you to bite you or not, but you. Hm? What should I do? They have to think about it, but they might just decide to fucking bite you. But if you feed them and if you keep feeding them, you stay with them and you, you, you, you become this connection to food for them. They'll accept you, but if you die, they're not going to cry. They don't give a flying fuck about you, and if they were hungry and they thought they could eat you, of course they would eat you. It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter how long you've been feeding them. You got a 20 foot long python, your house bitch, you're living in his house. Okay, will you are you are his little slave and you are bringing him offerings. That's King Kong. That thing is tied to a fucking pole. That's a monster and if as long as you keep feeding it, maybe it'll let you come close me. Maybe where you got it in your backyard. What are you doing there? You got to go cage back there. You crazy. Fuck.

Speaker 4:          00:31:12       I can't deal with it. So they can't even kill him, man. I can't go to Sally's house and see him. Give like a white fucking mouse to think. Especially when I'm high. My fucking hands. I've seen it. I've seen people say come over. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. I've seen. I had a friend. That's why I don't like it, but man, that's fucking creeped out for me. I don't know. It's completely creeped out. I Dunno. They're terrifying animals and those motherfuckers were the snakes walk outside with the snakes around that head. It's those motherfuckers and bird on her shoulder, which makes me want to not understand like especially like a parakeet or something on you. And I sit there and I get so high sometimes I get a fucking eagle just like I never see that. I would love to see something like that, like some jerk off doing magic tricks with the fucking parakeet on this show. One of those fucking birds are just come swooping on fucking bird and the fucking Iraq. There's a great video of a hawk. The comes into an eagle's nest to try to get the Hawke's Bay. The Eagles babies and the eagle just goes wham. Grabs it and eats it in front and starts feeding into the baby's wow. Fucking crazy. An Eagle just flies into this. Hawk. Hawk rather just flies into this eagle's nest.

Speaker 4:          00:32:28       Wow. It's crazy. I know that there was a guy on it. Watch this. There's eagles just chilling,

Speaker 6:          00:32:36       covering it's babies and this hawk is like Gimme, Gimme, Gimme your babies and

Speaker 3:          00:32:40       the eagle just like bitch don't do to others. America kills it on top of his babies. Look at this. Wow. Are Her babies rather? I'm sure that's a Mama, right? Only the mamas are the ones who guard the nes, I believe. I don't know though. But look, fucks up that Hawk and eats it. Yeah. They caught that on an eagle camera because they have a nest camera to monitor these birds. But what a creepy world. So the Eagle is the meanest one. Other the baddest, most Hollywood. Did you ever see it? No. No, no. No. What's in Hollywood? My friend hawks. Okay. The Hawk, he has um, vista right next to all those streets. What we used to curse on El Compadre, he's him and his wife put cameras because they would wake up in the morning and see dead pigeons or something. They couldn't figure out what it was.

Speaker 3:          00:33:29       And one day they got to have Keith. Okay. Okay. Yeah. The picture of a fucking, a pigeon landing. And then this thing coming behind it. Grabbing it and ripping his fucking head off like a monster. Just ripped his head off and started eating it without the fucking head right there on Vista, on sunset. I went to the Museum of natural history and tremendous. And the two of you, you know, you get to see. It's amazing, amazing the thing hanging the waylon top. Oh, it's still there. The dinosaurs alone. That means it's gigantic skeletons. They have incredible place, but they showed the, uh, the transition between the dinosaur and bird and you know, that's, that's a dinosaur. Like it's. They explained the whole thing, like the dinosaurs that survived became birds. When you see an eagle, that crazy country monster that represents our country, like what a perfect thing to represent our country.

Speaker 3:          00:34:21       Like we always thought. I always thought the eagles proud. Eagles. Both the Eagle is a county monster from the past. That somehow or another I managed to stay alive and as long as you keep giving it birds, it'll let you fucking hold it. It's only. The thing about eagles is they're not quite big enough to kill us. They're not quite big enough. You know, I'm a kill and Eagle man. I'll probably get fucked up a little bit. I'll get scratched up a bit, but if I get ahold of an eagle, I'm going to kill that fucking thing. Take the finger off, right. Probably fucked me up pretty bad. I'll probably be cut up pretty hard, but I'm going to win. I'm going to kill that fucking eagle and he knows it. He knows it. He looks at it and go, damn, I wish I could kill you, but you just tell a little too big because then he goes only like 50 pounds or something.

Speaker 3:          00:35:03       Right. You know, they looked. I mean they're pretty fucking scary and they, they, like I said, they will fucking hurt you, but most likely they're not going to be able to take you out, but they've tried to pick up kids and shit. Eagles have picked up a little boys before. I tried to fly off with him is a matter of fact. There's a video of an eagle picking up a kid that's a fake video. Is it a fake video? I've been just students. Son's a pitcher. He was not going to suddenly scared to check out. Like I see a chicken dog and I panic like I'm scared of the chickens. Chickens moving. I fucking panic at all. I could go into one of those butcher shops with animals, those Italian, like margiela and the east coast.

Speaker 4:          00:35:38       You ever go to those places where your mom goes in Newark and they have the fucking Italian butcher going in and have everything. Like all those birds. What's the whale? Then they'll have like a chicken and the other thing. Then they get exotic. You go do they serve as well? You Go, you know people are into eating like shit, like ego still, but this is the place where you could stick your hand in and the guy would take the chicken out and break its neck, cut it, and then your mother brings him home for Cte, like pheasants, maybe all that shit. I mean, in the old days they probably had like polar bears. Don't give a fuck.

Speaker 4:          00:36:15       What are you gonna? Need an alligator. We got it. Just give me 15 more. Currently there's a company that will serve you like Ryan stakes. Yeah, there's like, yeah, they're like, it's some sort of exotic game meat company and they'll, they'll sell you lying. You can eat lion and Colorado is known for that Shit. Restaurants could blue next whether you're taking 12. We discussed this where they take you, they pick you meet up at the top of snowmass village and they take you there and those things that the dogs, they take you over a mountain, you your wife, they put blankets on you. It has to be in the winter. This is real shit. They pick you up at 5:30 sharp. You get there, you'd come out and you get all the alligator fucking a dinosaur dinosaur. Fucking Puerto Rican meat.

Speaker 4:          00:36:59       Take a fucking rat. It's amazing. I saw it. I never went there. I knew the guy that had the dogs that would whip the fucking dogs and shit over there, so we had like a sweater, one of those, but I know that if you fly into China, Hong Kong, don't quote me on which continent. There's a restaurant that just specializes in testicles. Jesus. Did you see that shit? Every type of attack, there's one that belongs to a fucking Allah. It's a stamp and that's the big one that comes with a soup. It's like a testicle soup. I think it's like $18 for the fucking suit. Oh my God. I'll look it up. It's disgusting. But, um, making sure people pay the Animal Dick. That's fucking crazy. That. How funny is that? Even real life. Like your mom killed somebody in front of you, like your ego comes in real life. I was like, eat your Broccoli. I don't like Broccoli. You Bam. Bam. What's that?

Speaker 4:          00:37:56       Oh my goodness. Cat. Oh my God. They're all eating a cat. Holy Shit. Oh my God, Dude. That is a creepy, creepy animal. It's really. It just pulled the meat away from its babies by the way. One of them was like, that is mine. Well, it's been, it's been like taking it apart and feeding and I've been watching for awhile. It's really cute watching. Have you ever seen the video of the wolves are getting killed by the eagles? Yeah, guys have trained eagles. You got to see this. I think it's a mongols or is that a motorcycle gang? They're uh, they have a trained eagles, golden eagles

Speaker 2:          00:38:36       that a swooped down and uh, and kill wolves. I guess Golden Eagles are even bigger than, than a bald eagles. I think I should look it up. Let me look that up. Oh, Jesus Christ. That's big because the size of that thing and look how it does this. And the dude is all like done up and like tribal traditional, like animal skin clothes. I mean, he's in a harsh, harsh world and he's got this eagle. These got trained and this. That's a bad motherfucker. Watch this shit. Yo. It goes after a fucking wolf man. I mean, what a gangster bird. That's mean. You want to talk about that? That's like the wolf is like almost the top of the food chain. It probably thinks it is the top of the food chain. I was like, Oh shit. Bird knows what a terrifying feeling that must be to be a Goddamn wolf and still be scared of this evil bird.

Speaker 2:          00:39:34       Look how it takes it out. It just swoops down and grabs the bull by the back of the neck and just starts jacking it. Don't you think though, this wolf could easily just fucking attack this bird? No, you would think, but I think the birds are stronger than you think they, they're, they're, they're really primitive man. I mean, they're not like we look at them like they're all fluffy and shit, but you look at their musculature and the way they're designed, they're not designed like any other animal. We sort of associate their size with the way we would view like a mammal that was that size. Like, oh, that's not that big a deal. Like if, uh, you know, whatever. A puppy or something in or a dog rather, that was that big was trying to go after. You think that a dog that's only 60 pounds, it's not going to be able to kill you.

Speaker 2:          00:40:20       That what kind of. That's a Golden Eagle now that I've. They killed that. That thing would have claw. Yeah. Could the claw and the neck and then they, they tear him apart. I mean their claws are unbelievably strong and there's essentially knives. They have like knives on there, they're huge arms do. They can pick up a fucking salmon that's swimming in a river. Stop and think about that for a moment. How strong you have to be to grab a salmon with your hands. You're a big guy. Joey. Do you think you could grab a salmon? Do you think you could hold onto a salmon? There's no fucking way. How about grab it and then fly off with it? Do you know how fucking strong egos have to be? That's an evil ancient animal that we're like, it's the noble proud. Here you go. Remember, uh, that guy that sang those songs, the guy that John Ashcroft let the eagles soar.

Speaker 2:          00:41:16       Did you ever hear that song? Did you ever hear that song when Ashcroft was the, what is the attorney general or something like that. Whatever made up fucking title. It was whatever. Job Distinction. Yet he was working for the Bush administration, whatever function they in, and he was completely crazy. It was just nutty Christian guy and he had the most amazing song that he sang once. And when he, when he's saying, and everybody knew right away, like, Whoa, this guy is fucking nuts. I mean, we knew he was nuts, but what the fuck is this worth the like she's never saw before. And he said, yeah, it's. I mean it's, it's, you're watching madness, you're watching 100 percent pure, unfiltered madness. And you just watching it. All you think of is what kind of twisted shit is this guy doing when he's not doing this? Because if you're that far out there, you're that far out there that you're seeing that the ego will, you know, and you're like, it was like super, super duper Christian.

Speaker 2:          00:42:17       Like that guy had some fucking bones in his yard, man. Or do you think Wolverine Versus Wolf? Who would win if I had a guest pull up that left the eagles? Soar. Got, I need to hear that. But what's a wolverine? Um, I would say a wolverine is a, it's like a Badger, Badger, Badger family. And there were fierce, unbelievably fierce animals. They're crazy looking to. They look bad ass, man. It's like hugh grant. He does. It doesn't make sense. They call him wolverine because the whole idea of wolverine is wolverine was supposed to be built like Sean Sherk and was like a small guy, but he had these crazy muscles and he had like this adamantium skeleton. You had like some metal skeleton, but it was like a little like fierce thick guy, but then you have the. The guy plays him. What's his name man? The dude who plays, what does it?

Speaker 2:          00:43:06       Hugh Jackman, which I know. I just said it isn't. I like them to whatever. I blamed the weed, but Hugh Jackman is like this beautiful, tall, handsome, you know, like statuesque sort of male model looking dude. It's not really. It doesn't work for like that character. The character is supposed to be like a wolverine and Wolverine's like and that's what this guy was like. He was like, this hairy dude with his hands would turn into these sorts. Like they would come out, these giant knives come out where his knuckles are and he would just fuck people up. It was one of the most ruthless superheroes ever. When you think about it, I mean because he would just kill people all the time for the comic book. Oh, I fucking love the x man, man.

Speaker 9:          00:43:44       Listen to this day. She's never before. That's a real sign. I don't know why it's got the cow bell and the cowboy. The cowbell socks. This like, that was a cow bell thing going on

Speaker 2:          00:44:07       the Internet for awhile. That's crazy person it a crazy person. Crazy person with black socks that stinky feet, sweaty feet all the time. And leather shoes. Just wanting to get weird one that stick his thumb up. Your Butt fucking choke you or something bro. With Jay z going to Cuba. I don't know man. I don't know. I saw it in

Speaker 3:          00:44:32       the news you see that you saw on the news was what was hilarious was that the uh, the people in the news, we're looking at it as a political liability for President Obama that Jay Z is, you know, going to Cuba. Then it weakens the, the Obama position. Like he can't, he can't be friends with Jay z now to my. And I was watching it. I was like, wow, this is weird. This is like they've managed to turn the White House into the real housewives of Orange County. Literally have managed to turn the White House until like almost a, a bit of a reality show. Like, oh, what is, what is Obama going to do about Jay z Bnq? But oh, that's crazy. That's a really important thing to think about right now because it's not like there's a country called North Korea that as weapons and it's threatening to shoot at us and has nuclear capability.

Speaker 3:          00:45:17       Yeah, man, what about that wrapper? That guy who makes stuff? Ryan, why did he go to that place where everyone's poor? What the fuck? I just seen the headline from Atlanta Vanna, something like that. I'm like, oh, this is terrible. It's so weird how right now in today's world, the White House is really what's going on around. It is a reality show compared to what's really going on. The wife is on Conan O'brien jumping up and down credible whatever, and I ain't got nothing but love for. I love that woman, but do you understand me? I mean it's all different. Like it's like the government is pushing that shit at you to worry about that. While we're really, really going on right now, it's fucking scary whether it's Korea, whether it's going on. Oh, well one good thing. The post office ain't gonna fucking clothes now that you see that close on Saturday, starting in November for mail delivery on Saturday.

Speaker 3:          00:46:08       No more mail on Saturday. November. But no, they just changed on the Monday. They found Jesus. Somebody opened their mouth and so are you fucking serious? I get my copy of my fucking time street. Whatever the fuck it is magazine. I, you know, I really wondered whether or not we would be better off with a privatization and that, you know, because I think ups does an awesome job. I mean they're, they're amazing. And the, the postal service, the only issues that I've ever had with the postal service is going to the, the actual place to the actual place and waiting in line. That's the only issue that I've ever had. But the idea that you should have a government company that does what private companies do, like why would you even need it? You know, why would you need a, why do you need a post office?

Speaker 3:          00:46:52       Why do you need, you know, [inaudible] shit. I mean, the post office as, as it exists is great but shouldn't exist because, uh, of the market because it's like, you know, it fills a spot, you know what I mean? Like why should it be, why should it be the government that does that? That's what it was. One of the weird questions that are signing. In an ideal world, it would be great if the government did all that stuff right? In an ideal world it'd be great if we could trust everybody to handle everything, but it seems like everything gets handled best when it gets treated. Like it's a business, you know? And when, whenever you have like government organizations that are taking places that could be taken place by business, you sort of like, you're controlling things and regulating things. I mean obviously in the post office it works great, but it doesn't work great in the DMV, right? It doesn't work great in the TSA. It doesn't work. There's a lot of places where it doesn't work great.

Speaker 8:          00:47:40       Sure. Jonathan winters died. Yeah, I heard sex.

Speaker 3:          00:47:46       Why is it, you know, I, I hate to bring this up and keep going with this, but why is it that like the post office had all those shootings. What, what happened there?

Speaker 8:          00:47:57       Just because the workers were overworked. I mean if you look at if you go to the post office back in the day because it doesn't happen anymore, like the shootings don't have anymore. I, I don't know why it's not happening anymore, but there was a time like if you go to the post office now and you just look at the people that are working there, that looks like the most miserable job ever. They're just sitting there nonstop from eight in the morning,

Speaker 3:          00:48:19       but he just used stamps.com, lightened the load and then there would be less work and everybody could show the fuck out. Yeah. You imagine that's a thankless job man.

Speaker 8:          00:48:29       I didn't even check my mail and like I don't check my mail except maybe once a month now and it's like the worst idea in the rub because I'll, I'll check it and there's like all these bills and like late payments and stuff, but I hate the mail so much that now it literally, it's like a stack this big of mail once a month and only about five percent of it is something that I need you to pick up the mail it gets delivered to you now have a huge mailbox. They just, they just, I mean it's right in front of my house. I just don't even care. I just. Okay. So the post office is completely a government Gig, right? I think it is. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:48:57       My uh, I have a friend back home. My friend Adam, who's a postman, he's been a postman forever. He used to work out with them at the Boston Athletic Club, like back in the day and he's like, he was like a real neighborhood postman. He would like go door to door, knew everybody. Said Hi. They would like give them tips for like Christmas and stuff. It was like a real neighborhood postman. Do they still have those? Yeah, some places still have like a real. A guy who was like, how you doing? Good morning. Like knows everybody

Speaker 4:          00:49:26       now is a dick. But the guy, the guy hadn't Hollywood, he was a Filipino and they gamble. So I owned them. He delivered to me first. He knew if I. I would tell them don't. I'm getting a check this week. Stopped by here first and I'd see him like at night he'd give me the check early and shit. Good guy. Still seeing him. He's still down. I wonder if

Speaker 3:          00:49:45       so how those guys feel about things like stamps.com. I mean they still have to deliver things so you know what I mean?

Speaker 8:          00:49:50       It's not affecting them. That's actually probably make.

Speaker 4:          00:49:53       Yeah. It's probably like a lightening the load a little bit. Guys love their fucking job. That's a great job. You're walking, especially in California with the mail. People hate more than fucking we do is the ship they have to deliver. That's why a lot of them. See I'm talking to you from the other end. I did time with three dudes that dumped the fucking circulars, so if a mailman dumped circulars, they go, what are you talking about? Oh, well you gotta think from routes. It says grapefruit, three for ninety nine cents. Spam spam in your mailbox. I know male guys that have done time, like I knew a fucking hippie in the coolest motherfucker ever. Tenge coolest white dude. I loved them from fucking some white investment in Oklahoma. I loved long hair. He used to be fucked with them, put it in a ponytail. This motherfucker filled this garage, I don't know, for 10 years with the spam and something happened at his house.

Speaker 4:          00:50:46       He had a fire in the backyard and they found 10 years on boarding the fucking on it. No, he didn't want to mail it to people. We thought it was fucking terrible, but he had a do as part of his job. They threw him in fucking jail. Oh, they throw in jail because he didn't send it out. Yes. Those. Because he didn't want to spam them. Yeah. He didn't know. He liked the people in his neighborhood and these people got together and they got his little legal defenses down like two grants, two years in time. He did federal time and then I met other guys a diagnostic who were cool mailman who just, that's the big beef and my one of the kids I grew up with them. I'm very tight with filter this day got fired and he tells hysterical like he used to take the little car into the city to go to the RTB.

Speaker 4:          00:51:30       Right. And he'd go pick up grandma, blowing a little mail cart and go back over the Jersey over the bridge and he throw the mail away. He would tell me how the whole place was. He got fired before he got caught because all their phones. And listen to this. This is 20 years ago, so here you go. You ready for this bomb? They had him on tape 20 years ago. Gambling on the post office phone. Oh Wow. They been listening on the phone before nine slash 11. The act of [inaudible] 66 that we all buy into. So they just recording agency since 1950. They've been taping everything when you call home and tell your husband going to go home and suck his dick. Got It on tape. You know what I'm saying? It's hysterical. They called them in and play the tape. That's hilarious. So this data, we said, well, one of the day investigating the bookmakers. No, we weren't calling them and making my shift ends of the 12 come. No one's ever done a movie about wild-ass mailman

Speaker 8:          00:52:21       because some crazy mailman stealing shit and finding like some check and figure shit they find they fucks. Probably live checks to say. I mean like they walk around, there's like these girls that are at home by themselves, you know these, these, these wives that you know and they probably know that the mailman, right?

Speaker 4:          00:52:40       Skanks you can make it happen. Oh, and do me a favor before you tough guys or the right ones for you. Tough guys. Touch your mailman. Touch him. Touch him. Getting to be for your mail mail one time. Oh, this is a federal employee. Yeah. Tell your mailman one time. Hey, fuck off. If you're going to come over here, don't fucking hit the gate because my baby say that the middle man one time and see what happens to you, but how about don't say that because let me tell you something. Within 15 minutes you have a police car, your house, and then you'll have another fucking employee, some car that you've never seen before. And they fucking. I had a friend that either mail man with a Frisbee. Oh No. And I was only, they were doing that shit and the guy cut across and hit them with a Frisbee and they laughed.

Speaker 4:          00:53:22       So the guy thought it was done. Intentionally brought this guy, did a year in fucking jail duty. Fucking assault charge. Touching a fucking mailman. But in both at one time. This is an interesting story. In the boulder, there was a guy that got bit by a dog. So now his phobia, he hated dogs, but he needed the job as a mailman. So if you left your dog in the yard, he would spray your dog shit to your face. So one woman was home one day, he heard the dog, you know the dogs outside and seeing the mailman's fucking sprang and some she told the neighbors some other dog had died in that route and the guy waited from this [inaudible] 90 no. 80 six in boulder. Guy Waited for the mailman. Next Day, took him to the fucking boldly you to be careful, bro. They took him in that fucking backyard. Him and his brother and a beat on this fucking guy. I think one of them went to jail. The other boulders are fucking crazy place like that. When you don't know who you're messing with. People.

Speaker 3:          00:54:20       Colorado are the descendants of old cowboys. I mean you gotta think like back

Speaker 4:          00:54:24       generations. He imagined fucking mailman up. I come in. Well they did in goodfellas.

Speaker 3:          00:54:29       Well, if a guy killed your dog, you know that you love, you might. You might be willing to do a little time. You know, there's some pieces of shit out there, man. There's some pieces of shit. It'll kill your dog. Fucking poison. They don't care. I have a friend who moved to a place, he had a Barky dog, so I'm poisoned his dog, you know, I mean, that's a crazy shit man. You know, I mean, I can understand that you ever have a problem with it. It sucks. It sucks it. Some guy has a barky dog, but poisoning the dog is crazy. I mean, and not only that, it was, it was a big area. He lived in like a, a big rural area. So his dog wasn't even on leash like because his dog was allowed to roam free, but apparently people didn't like it that this new dog live in the neighborhood and start barking. So they just poisoned it, you know, that's just. I hate when people, uh, get defined in life has been like an animal lover or not. I mean everybody's an animal lover. We're all, we're all lovers of animals that you can trust, you know, and when you meet a person and they have a cool dog, like, you know, a friendly person by their friendly dogs, you know. So like the idea that you could do that to spray dogs and the fence. Yeah, that's like a sociopathic sort of thing.

Speaker 3:          00:55:49       That little dog do you have.

Speaker 8:          00:55:51       It's not even real. It's not even real man. Is Your dogs. Your dogs don't even really marked for his first time last night for days. And did you come? No, no he didn't. He, I have mirrors in my bedroom, like I'm on the doors and he just sits there and stares at Adam self because he doesn't understand. Verus, and finally last night he went crazy on the mirrors and just barked his first time it was. Oh, that's hilarious. He's so cute, man. It's ridiculous. Yeah, I found something. I've been cleaning out my office. Uh, I found something the other day and it completely opened up like, like a memory that I completely forgot about

Speaker 5:          00:56:24       when I was younger. And this is so crazy. I can't believe I forgot this. We used to have this thing called time and temperature. Do you guys remember? Do you guys have where you live? Where you called a phone number? Like the time? Is the temperature? Remember that?

Speaker 4:          00:56:37       Well, the sense a call, your mother will almost fucking kill you. I didn't know that, 80 bucks and fucking time and I got a fucking collapsed all over the house. I remember that when I was a kid I had a calling card and if I didn't know the time I could use my calling card and a fucking phone booth and call and get the time and temperature that wants to put his. That

Speaker 5:          00:56:58       the one in Ohio was free I think and it was just a phone number you call it. But what happened is, is at one point something broke where like anyone else that was calling could talk to the other people listening. So it became a chat room for like three months. You would call time and temperature and suddenly here like, hello, are you there? Anyone there? And you're like, yeah, I'm here. How are you know, like you start talking to people. So I met this girl on top on time and temperature and I got her phone number and then we started talking for like two weeks and she said she went to a different school and all this stuff and then she was a virgin and she was like, I will pay you $100 if you sleep with me. And I was like, yes, I will take that money.

Speaker 5:          00:57:41       I was 17, I was like $100. That's amazing. So she, I was kinda scared of how she looked and everything like that. She came over to my. I was when I lived with my mom and my mom was out of town. She came over one weekend, never met this girl, just talk to her a few times on the phone that are on time and temperature. She comes over and she was like a lot older, like I'm 17. She was probably like 30 and I was like alright. And she. But she acted like she was in high school the whole time and I just was like, I guess she's in high school, but like I knew, I knew that she was older, like, and then she wrote me a check with her name on it and I was like, oh you have a checkbook or wow, that's cool.

Speaker 5:          00:58:16       Like I was 17, I didn't have a, but she could write checks and I fucked her and I've now looking back at it. I never even thought about it. She was totally an older chick that was fucking younger guys. Like she, I was underage and she paid me. I was a hooker at 17. That was time and whether one of and pick up kids because kids can kids. Only kids were doing it. Like I remember like this was like a chat line for kids and I will be like, oh, what's going on? Yeah, Worthington. So she was just some crazy freak bitch. It was fucking 17 year olds. Yeah, meeting. I'm on time and temperature. That's amazing. But then she know you were 17. Oh yeah, yeah. I said I went to high school. She said she went to this other high school that was like 20 minutes away.

Speaker 5:          00:58:58       It's possible that she just did a lot of meth. A. Honestly, when she first came over I was like, oh my God, I'm in trouble. This is the person's mom. But then she was the girl and then she like, we didn't barely talk. I remember she walked in and we talk for a second. I just turned off the lights in my living room. We fucked on the floor and she gave me a check and she left. It wasn't like in and out half hours, but you spend the money. It took a while to cash a check because

Speaker 8:          00:59:22       I didn't have a, a checking account and so I had to like, I think I had to like get a cashier at a grocery store or something. But yeah, I spent the money.

Speaker 3:          00:59:31       It's great. I totally forgot about it though. Wouldn't it be an amazing reality show to follow that woman around? Like if you could go back in time and just watch how she did it in the age of no Internet, just fine young guys and meet them somewhere and just fuck them and pay him. Actually Pam, like how crazy was that chick? Do you think she was that crazy? Or maybe it was just like a one time thing where she just lost her mind and got caught up in the thrill of the moment. Yeah. I have no idea, man. Think about how creepy that movies. Because again, how do we make one of the payphone at the bottom of the stairs at the comedy store and watch the checks coming in and out of the bathroom. Will you guys do is way out of why the telephone when somebody's going to be drunk and somebody should have never taken down that painful history. Oh my God. They should put a payphone back there. They should find a payphone.

Speaker 8:          01:00:21       Yeah. They took it down and they also took the wind down at the Improv that used to be outside of it. They shouldn't do that, but you know it's still there at the comedy store is where like all the guy comics come in and they tilt the the window so it's like perfectly. So you can go to the stairs outside and just sit there and look down and see any girls in the bathroom. Oh, that's so gross. That's so gross. That's so fun. That's why whenever I like my girls are like,

Speaker 3:          01:00:47       that's really illegal. You shouldn't even really be talking about that on the phone or on the podcast. Allegedly. I've never done it. Really creepy. Sitting down by the phone waiting for fucking pictures to coat the. If you're a girl. No Shit. That's disgusting. Piece of shit. That's a. that's a terrible human being. And you're like thinking it's all silly there. Run your foot. Jamie Kilstein would be yelling at you right now. Crying out rape culture. Say that. I've noticed they do that. Yeah, and I could probably tell you someone should fucking black that out, man. You just call them. Call the manager and they have to do. Now they're going to have to. By the way, you just fucked it up. We've all done things, but that's one of the fucking life. You're not gonna be able to pull that off anymore because you talked about on the podcast and the comedy store's going to have to fix that or they'll be liable. It's funny because every time you have to let them know, man, if you let go in there, you better let them know for real because people are going to talk about it in the pocket. That's a big issue, man. You're. You're making it out like it's not a big issue, but looking in on girls like fixing of a mirror or a window to look into girls while they shit. That's like a seriously against the law and seriously creepy.

Speaker 8:          01:01:52       Yeah, I agree, but you're just joking around about it. I'm saying that every time I have a girl, I'm with a girl and she goes to the bathroom. That's the one thing I say, make sure those things are shut when you go in there. Blind things stuff. Well, I mean if you go in there as a girl though and you see it, it's obvious like, all right, there's an open window right here. I should shut this.

Speaker 3:          01:02:10       That shit's ridiculous. It shouldn't be there. It shouldn't be like that. Girls shouldn't have to be, especially in a place where they're serving alcohol. The last thing that should have to happen as a girl should have to worry about who could

Speaker 10:         01:02:20       possibly looking through a window while she shitting. Yeah,

Speaker 4:          01:02:22       that's nonsense. That's complete nonsense. Fix that.

Speaker 7:          01:02:27       You just eat edibles. Careful. You're a dangerous man. Champions going to be jamming. These edibles are potent shit. Sterile cap at the whole bag it 130 that this fucking thing. Okay. Uh, it's like a tootsie roll. Fucking kill you. It's amazing. By next year in California that's going to be like zombies. They will be zombies because they're going to double this. This is for fucking loads. They're going to double this. Don't, don't say it. Don't say that. People are going to be walking around with shirts ripped open

Speaker 4:          01:03:03       zombies and shit and that is fucking crib. You know, we've all had the, I don't know, I don't know. I don't remember looking through the peephole over that. You don't know, just, it was just fucking crazy shit that you try to think of all the crazy women that I met through that over the years and the different situations. It's fucking crazy. You could write a book and it's kind of disgusting. Oh, the comedy story saying disgusting. You know what the, the beautiful thing about the comedy store was the comradery between contracts, like we all sit in that back and hang out. That was a, there was so much camaraderie and that guess still is.

Speaker 10:         01:03:41       Yeah. It's like having an employee meeting with, uh, your, your peers every night. And it's, it was, uh, it was so loosely regulated. You know, it's getting more tighter now, unfortunately. Well, we kind of have to do that. It should have probably been tighter a long time ago, but the real issue was always, you know, how do you, how do you run a club and run a business and then still sort of let the comedians do whatever the fuck they want. Sometimes it doesn't work out. Comedians wreck your blades, you know, that's why I always try to contribute to that place as much as I could. Like is like I would do it for free. I paid for the sound system there. It's like, what? You need to go back there and pay for any sentences. No, that's bullshit. I'm sure it has a sound system. I bought in like 2001 or some shit, you know, it's an old sound. So it's scary there too because I do the show up in the belly room and, and uh, up in the belly room is like falling apart like you, like I went to plug something in and like all the electricity went out and then I'm like, these, these outlets are not legal. Like this is impossible. Like you would like, I'll turn on, light

Speaker 4:          01:04:41       them under the bus boy, keep it up, keep it up. You're like, fuck you. There's gonna be people that are thinking big conspiracy. Well, what I know is the Joe Rogan had a problem with us. Next thing, his little bitch, Brian Rad. He's just talking about the lines about our security staff with some of the finest in Los Angeles. Okay. I handpick them myself. Fucking thing blew up. But things from 1920 people. She's dead. Oh fuck. See, I have nothing but love. Got One foot in the grave. One of banana peel that she's very. She's very unhealthy. But I love that. Have never had any, any issue with her. But I'm talking about the building that it's funny watching it. Nope. There's no maintenance man walking around in the daytime looking at the fucking uh, the plugs attention. I don't know about. She didn't want to lift a rock for 18 years ago. That motherfucker must be leaking like a motherfucker. That thing that it's didn't want to go. Remember she got Bob Baker up. They're putting this back on. That motherfucker made a coke and fucking black tar and all that shit.

Speaker 4:          01:05:56       Fucking roof of your building. You a fucking problem. Fuck no fucking jumped off a roof. Fucking. It's fucking California. It's 80 degrees outside. Fuck Bob Baker. Fucking Bob Baker putting. Fuck. Come on up. Help me. You fucking crazy. I'm gonna. Fall under that roof. I got nobody that suit. Do you remember when the guys were launching water balloons from talking about that the other day? Yeah, whatever was there. There was like. That was about seven years ago. Steve Reynolds. Easy. Hey, it was. Who the fuck are you talking about? Jesus Christ. Son T, you need to go to a doctor. I swear to God. Five years before someone who's shy right now. We can't tell the story. I heard the story five years before I got there. When Tupac shot the gun in there. Oh, it was all a black club. They used to have metal detectors at the door in 95. I never saw that.

Speaker 4:          01:06:47       I was there. I was there in [inaudible] 94. It wasn't like that. They would just have like fat Tuesday's. We get crazy. The one that Eddie Griffin was saying one night, Tupac Lynn, and then they had to shoot out and everybody ran. Mitzi bandom because she thought it was him. In fact, the bullets are still on the front room. I'm one of the things still yet to fuck. I wouldn't. I wouldn't doubt that. There is some crazy shit that went down there because they, they did have some crazy shit happen there. Even like Kennison shot a gun in that place. He, there's a hole in the backside and that came from kinisons gun. It's still there. The whole still there. It's kind of fucking cool. You know, just to be around a place for Camp Sam Kinison last shot. A hole in a fucking sign. I think it was about dice tip.

Speaker 4:          01:07:26       Was it? Yeah. I think we should have asked him about how he did. My memory is done. You know, it's crazy. My memories. It's filled no room. I'm taking it too much information lately. It's crazy. At 30 years from now, you know, and they know they're going to call and say somebody you often 10 million for that property. Oh the store. Anything. Any day somebody is going to break and go, you know what the fuck, let's buy that side. This side. The side across the street. Well you know, it's worth a lot of money. Worth a lot of history of that place. It's just under history is on the fire. But. But some John Deere fireball, some Japanese group, we don't give a fuck about her. It's true. It's going to show up with 60 mil, but an underground casino in there. Whatever the fuck they do because all those streets haunted and you know what?

Speaker 4:          01:08:12       We're going to be driving by that he is going to come because it's. It's. It's impossible to pull something like that off today. Is someone willing to gamble that much money today? Or is this a tricky economy? I don't know. Every time you go to vegas, every time you go to vegas, aren't they building a new fact? Somebody is talking to somebody telling them that the future is bright. You gotta be bright. You know what it also is to. They just adjust. Like instead of making 10 billion, okay, we're making five. We call, we call with five, let's be cool with 5 billion and they just cut it in half and they're. They take a loss. All those guys have something that's losing though that fucking angle to write off and have a good time. But to take that place down, it would be so sad. Every place has gone down. Even fucking Arnold's went down on happy days. You know what I'm saying? It was arnold's fucking real.

Speaker 4:          01:09:02       It was real enough. But they shoot, they fucking take everything the fuck down and that's, you know, that's the reality of it. It's so weird. I don't even go to that side of the sunset. I know how I drive by it and I feel guilty. When I had my ear infection I had to go to Canada to go get a hearing test and I drove past and there was amazing. I'm like, when was the last time I drove on bucking sunset when you and I used to hang out there between like was it like, I think like 98, 97, 97, 2005. I was in

Speaker 5:          01:09:33       Kinda wish you guys would hang out with us one day to me, Don Barris and all of us, Tony Inches, all just sitting in the back shooting the shit, smoking too much weed

Speaker 4:          01:09:43       back. Seeing the same people who were in charge back then during the men steal stele incident. They're still in charge.

Speaker 5:          01:09:50       They're the only person there is one person,

Speaker 4:          01:09:53       people, man, that angle of it is forgotten. I take it from a different angle. That was then. This is. No, there's nothing I could do to bring that back. Why don't I? Why don't I go home, get my football jacket and put it on. It ain't got in front of my high school. The improv has never been anything but cool to me know they're very proud of them. All of them were great and on top of that, I mean there's also the laugh factory. Jamie Masada is a wacky dude. Nice final month and then there's the fucking ice house, which is the greatest club in the world. That's my back yard. I don't even need to go anywhere else. I'm fucking hobbyist out. The thing

Speaker 5:          01:10:34       cool though, is that all of you, like if you guys were to come last night on the patio as an example, you guys would have been like, oh my God, there's like 30 people here that I know all in one big group. What? I mean, everyone's got their dogs now and it's amazing place. I'm going to hit you from a different angle. This is the angle I like that.

Speaker 4:          01:10:56       I remember being up there and being 30, seeing old guys going, what the fuck I gotta hear this story when he was here. He, you know, I'm so insecure when it comes to that. Joe. I saw Carlin there. Dude Carlin hung out. That was one night. I know.

Speaker 3:          01:11:14       What I'm saying is, you know those guys that become that. All of a sudden I don't want to be there, but you know, this guy's like dom irrera. He'll stop in. He just bangs out. Is set. Hangs out a little bit. Dama Breira is one of the coolest motherfuckers that guy is. He's like a real stand up. You know, like when you got the weekend with him and did you say this? You guys are working together one weekend together at the Ice House. The last week. It's for shows crush. You don't like the building on fire once in the. It's going to implode. Let me tell you something. Dom irrera is one of the most underrated headliners ever. That's my take on him. I. That guy is when he's on when dominant, like I did that show with him at the factory and he was on. Dude, he's fucking brilliant. Hilarious. The shit that he comes up with the and he constantly rights. He's constantly writing. He's constantly like looking at the news, coming up with new shit.

Speaker 4:          01:12:07       I've heard two beautiful jokes the last six months. That a brilliant. The one joke was the one my boy said on the Oscars when he said that. Right now the show's being viewed by 2 billion people. That's why God is going to come up here and ask you about her privacy. Something like that. That's a well written Joe Damo rabbit athletic joke. That's a great job. That is one of the best jokes I haven't heard in a long time since your island, Nicole. That is one. Save the fucking that athletic athletic neighborhood. It is such a fuck. And you know, say the joke. I don't want to. I don't want to say it. You got to see it. What do you get a chance to see this? Because you guys are what? Where is this that you guys are gonna work together the last week of July, like the four shows.

Speaker 4:          01:12:53       Oh my God, we've got putting shows Friday to Saturday and I'm honored because you know what? After I've been watching them that that Wednesday night he's got at the laugh factory is when you really get the seat down. That's it. He's in the catcher seat. His legs, I think it's Tuesday, right? What's in it? Busting balls with Donald Wednesday too. He does. He does more than one show there. It's going to take a look no matter who he got there sometimes, and I don't like to say that sometimes he's got and you'll understand what I'm saying, Joe. Sometimes he's got a comic on there that doesn't shine and the social avenue of comedy sometimes some people just so introverted. Go Watch them with those people. He brings it to life and he's brilliant. He turns around and Bob so friendly. It's easy to easy to banter back and forth.

Speaker 4:          01:13:41       When they called me and asked me, I said, yeah, why not? I just watched. Now I want somebody for four shows and I got a different flavor. It's very tough to learn from somebody when you watch 10 minutes sets in La, La me doesn't give people come out and I'm not discouraging people coming out and going, oh, I'm going to Joe Rogan. Excuse me, at the comedy store. That's a 20 minute set. At least sometime sit tight. We'll get there. But to see a 10 minute dominant wherever tartar, 45 minute damn Rara yeah. It's two different fucking people.

Speaker 3:          01:14:12       Yeah. It's, I think it's that way with you as well. Uh, you know, I think it's that way with anybody. You know, I've seen you do 10 minutes. That's not what I want to see you do a half hour. I want to see you do 40. I think at a certain point in time I'm done. You know, I'm, I'm, I'm cool. If someone wants to do 50 minutes of hard shit, you know, I don't mind. I don't mind that, but I really like a long set. Like when you get into a guy and he started laughing at is stuff you want to keep laughing, you know, you want to keep, you want to keep going, you want them to keep going. Like a norton. I saw Norton in Austin and he had like a 50 minute set. I was like, wow, that's like a, that's like almost like a perfect time because he had like two guys go on before him and he fucking devastated for 50 minutes and then after the 15 minutes was over, it's like you felt like perfect. Like it was. He just nailed it. He blast. It's like an episode of game of thrones. It's about 50 minutes, you know, it's not really an hour. It's like, just blast you with hilarious shit and then you're like, that was great. It was like the perfect amount. There's just like a balance. They're trying to find the perfect amount. How much is too much? How much? A little too little. But those 10 minutes are always a little. It's hard. It's not bad for you.

Speaker 4:          01:15:15       No, no, no. I love it. I love it. I love going to the local places doing 15 or something just to get out of the fucking house. I was at the last two nights and I had a blast. I went to to like, I went through my spot orange and packed with that squad people. People brought pictures of chimps I'm sure. Had a fucking sandwich. Bach and he believed the sandwiches. I've told you about this place before and then last night I went to a place. No, amber, this place was on fucking fire bucket. Was somebody on a balcony? Oh No. Fuck it outside. Outside on the third floor. Wow. It's like the second night they did it like once a month. Who was with you? By myself. They call me. Like yesterday we had a four. I was that. What was that? Like? Tremendous 30 minutes. I was home by 1130 and it's all people coming out to see you.

Speaker 4:          01:16:04       Mixed. Mixed, you know, like local guys put together and Shit. It's amazing that some weeks I stayed home and some ways I go this week I'm going out five nights just to feel what that's like and I'll do five nights with the Friday being the highlight of the joke. Now I'll take Saturday off. I'm home or something. I stayed home with whatever the fuck, you know what I'm saying? Some nights I like doing that. Some weeks, Tuesday night did something really cool. I did red sting. Oh, the storyteller show at the theater with the comedy central and it was, it was good to see her brother. That was his baby. You know what I'm saying? He's filling in for comedy central now. So it was when he called me, he was embarrassed about what does this. I don't care if it goes on comedy central Dot Com. Okay. Have a fucking embarrassed. You know, I could just see. He was like, he thought it. He thought he was gonna. Call me like what? Carnegie Hall Gig. Know what I'm saying? And it was beautiful job. If they're going to put it on comedy central and we'll get a lot of years to see that. He put this together, this was, he had two sets work that, you know, the camera he had makeup on. He wasn't neurotic Jew. He wasn't mumbling. Ari's legit. Now he is very

Speaker 3:          01:17:10       bridget

Speaker 7:          01:17:10       and it's really weird to see a guy that really paid his dues. I saw him when we got to the store, he would sit back there like a nerdy motherfucker with that hair cut one day, bust out with like 90 percent commercials and the whole time he was going out and

Speaker 3:          01:17:26       fucking everything and we got hemorrhoids in his ass. Remember this shit the size of a finger we started taking on the road was like, wow. What year was it? That early. Let me start taking 2005. I'm sorry. It was way earlier. Yeah, way later than that. No, I think. No, I think it was before 2006 because I remember it was a Mike Young, couldn't make a Gig and Ari came instead of her and yeah, in Denver and he fucking destroyed and he was only doing comedy a few years back then, you know, but to, to him, like I said, I think it was probably the biggest crowd he'd ever had and then like his development from then on really a lot of it was like going up in front of these giant crowds. Like he went from like open mics to like doing these sold out gigs and in between he would do the store, you know, and are we went like in front of our eyes from being like a guy just starting out to being like a fucking legit headline that I would go see. Like if I was in like say if I lived in a town, if I lived in Utah or some shit like that and it was going to wiseguys I would go see are like that. Like I'm a comedy fan. I would, I would go see that. And that's, it's, it's crazy to watch. It's crazy to watch crazy. It's crazy to watch it happen to Youtube, man. It's, it's, it's in Dunkin as well. It's crazy how much it means to me now, like in the early when

Speaker 7:          01:18:46       I was here didn't mean to me enough now like, no, I have to sit down and write it out. I have to really think about it. I have to think about my thoughts. I've been thinking about because I don't want people to be disappointed, you know? I don't want to write material that's bad for me. I want it to be, you know. Right. You have been my thing and responsibility. I'm the same way. I want to do 50 minutes, an hour when I'm going to be out. I want to smoke dope and drink some fucking water, whatever. I, I just, uh, it's been a real pleasure lately. It's been a real. The whole twitter, the whole writing. It really has fucking made me sharp. The podcasting, the fucking podcast and gets to a different level now. Yeah. We got on here now. I can listen to a podcast now for 15 minutes and I can tell what's good and bad. It's radio wish. When we do a podcast, they tap into a conversation. It's like walking in, sitting down and going, I'm right here, my sandwich, and next thing you know, you just listening and learning. Well, it's like they get to see you in the most real estate environment

Speaker 3:          01:19:44       possible. Like the the most surreal you possible like I don't feel represented by and things at 140 characters. Like when I write things on twitter, a lot of times I run. I'm like, oh, how's that going to be conveyed? You know what I mean? It's only 140 characters. When you. When I hear you say something, I know exactly what you're saying. I know where it's coming from anew. Your inflection, your pause, the seriousness in your voice, the intensity in your tone, whenever, whatever it is. I know what you're saying. It's hard to express yourself on twitter, but on the podcast, that's where people grow to love human. Then they see. They hear that voice on twitter when they read your tweets, they know you, they know your voice. I mean, you know who you are, so they see that in your twenties. Then it works.

Speaker 3:          01:20:23       But it's a lot of things on twitter, like people, people. I had an issue this week or um, uh, people, uh, I've had a few, but uh, people keep getting upset at things that are right on twitter that I think are pretty obvious jokes. Yeah. They kind of Douchey, like kind of like I said about something about male vegans. I said, uh, if you're a male, if you call yourself a male Vegan, I hope you choked. No, not male vegans. Excuse me. Excuse me. Male feminists. I said that if you call yourself a male feminist, I hope you choke to death on Vegan Pizza, like crying to a lady Gaga Song. Okay. I'm just joking. All right. We fucking lax. I'm 140 characters. When you say something like that, people like, oh, he hates all male feminists or feminists, or he's a chauvinist or something like that. It's like, no, but let's be honest.

Speaker 3:          01:21:11       How many guys that you talked to that are male feminists are really annoying? How many? It's most of them. Most guys who are male feminists are really annoying. Well, there's been a few. There's what? Listen, the ideals behind it, nothing wrong with it. The ideal. We get some more of those corvette things and some of the cocoa cafes. Man, those are the shit. Yeah, I have a cookbook cafe, but this, um, the tweet, I just, first of all, it all started out. I got pissed off and I talked about this a little bit on the ice house chronicles. So there was some lady that was saying nasty shit about kids like didn't like kids and started wrote on twitter that I view women who don't like kids the same way I view dogs that like to eat, throwing shit. Like that's how I look at him.

Speaker 3:          01:21:52       Like, Oh, what is that? You know, it was just, it was just being a fly on the wall during a shitty conversation. Right? So I write that down on twitter and then people get angry at me. Like you're equating women too. Shit, eating dogs. And No, not exactly. I mean yes and not exactly what I'm basically saying is it's kind of a gross thing when someone doesn't like kids and that's what I was feeling at the time, but I didn't know. I probably shouldn't have wrote women. I probably should've wrote men. I didn't think about it because it was actually a woman who was doing it and I always like it when I see women that like kids especially because I have kids and women that like kids are like cute to the kids and it's kind of fun. But I should've said people and not, you know, men or women and I should have probably said hate instead of not like.

Speaker 3:          01:22:36       Because people were saying, oh, like if women don't want to have children and they're pieces of shit that had nothing to do with it. What I meant, I don't care if a woman doesn't want to have kids, you should absolutely be able to do whatever you want to do. And I could totally understand not wanting to take on the responsibility of kids. If you're a woman. That's not what I'm saying. I don't mean doesn't want to have one. What I meant was doesn't like them. That's it. Like people don't like to like fucking kids away from me. That's creepy. It irks me. It irks me with anybody, with men or women. But I saw a woman it. So I tweeted about that. Then I started getting all these white knight feminists dudes that were giving me a hard time. I'm like, man, you weak bitches.

Speaker 3:          01:23:13       You better shut your mouth. He's silly. Fuck. So it was just like over and over again, this nonsense about, you know, this, this contributes to violence against women and your attitudes or misogynistic and like, well I'm talking about someone who doesn't like kids. That's it. That's all I'm saying. You know, and I'm standing in 140 characters and maybe it's like, it's just a stupid way to say anything controversial. You know, maybe twitter if you don't want to be misunderstood. And if you don't want to have to explain yourself, don't say anything controversial, you know, because anything. Because people look easy because it's such a limited form of expression. They can all of a sudden imply all sorts of meaning to it and then write, hold blogs about this implied meaning they all of a sudden have like this whole cause and all they're doing is misinterpreting an original statement, but because it's so narrow and its definition, because it's only 140 characters, there's so much room for them bullshitting and coming up with their own meaning and now.

Speaker 3:          01:24:10       So it's good because like, I had a bunch of feminists write blogs about me. It was hilarious, like reading all this, like my massage mystic attitudes and this and that, like that's about as far from the truth as I hope, you know, I always try to be as, as open to everybody as possible. I like being a man, but uh, I don't have any problem with anybody just because they're a woman. I think that's completely ridiculous. I think though that there's a lot of fuckery in this world, man. And there's a, there's a lot of people that are full of shit on both sides of the fence. Hail Satan, that Hail Satan thing. Yeah, that's A. Duncan had this thing he did for her wedding and Tom Lava, that internal event and that's it, right? Yeah. And he was uh, he asked me to, uh, do a devil horns and where his tee shirt and look at the, take a picture.

Speaker 8:          01:25:04       It was a cool wedding and music was played there with a. what's that guy? The Hank Williams. The third one?

Speaker 3:          01:25:10       Yeah. I didn't get to meet the other guy wanted to meet him because I love the wonderful white to West Virginia. But anyway, you know, he goes, well you wear my shirt and do the devil horns. Were like, yeah, fuck it dude. I'll do it. And then I got all these people. St Joe Rogan is a satanist that is for real. That is the dumbest form of Satan is like you really thinking that, that satanism me standing there with a, a tribute. What does it say? Attribute to what

Speaker 8:          01:25:34       a tribute to six, six, six, six, six, whatever. What you're also saying, your tattoos have satanic things and I've been seeing a lot of crazy things lately where it's like your left arm I think has like some kind of a satanic snake on it or something.

Speaker 3:          01:25:54       Fucking dragon to represent my ferocious spirit son. Shame of people don't. People will take the time to acknowledge that shit and can

Speaker 4:          01:26:04       blow it up, you know, but also no, shut up. Right. But it's also people on both ends, like you choosing to get upset about some really ridiculous should read a tweet and you go to that person's paid and you go, I get it. Once I read some tweet and I go to their main page, I can put. I can add up right in one minute ago. I get it. I get where he was coming from. I understand why you said that. He's a musician. He's Dad, he's a politician. He sells this. He likes. Like today somebody hit me and I ran. He was a poor riser fan. I get it. You're a fucking book. You know what I'm saying? I've never met a poor riser fan, so if you shoot yourself in the fucking mouth right now, you want somebody. If I go to some of these pains and I see like music and I know the music sucks, that's where it ends because of his choice and music sucks.

Speaker 4:          01:26:53       That's what if I don't see fucking one of my three on that, like I'm going to go into people's. There's two things. I judge people. I don't judge people by money and not legit people. That music collection. If I look at your collection and you don't have sabbath paranoid if you don't have the staples Zeplin too. Those are the staples Zeplin to why we're here. Why are you? Why are you wasting my fucking time? I'm over here. You got like 30 grand. You know what I'm saying? That's. And number two, when you open up some of these refrigerated, there's certain. Yeah, it's true. You Open. That tells me everything. If you're a fucking move, if you're a month, if I see like low and beer, your fucking ain't never coming in and there's certain people that they have music laying around just because it's cool, but tons of them.

Speaker 4:          01:27:35       That's why the generation of people that want to say, and I know this and I don't hate you because I'm kind of in the same way that they don't want to like floyd. They prefer to listen to, oh, that's so commercialize that into more receipt. You know, that make me feel bad. The worst being the Tom Waits era, those motherfuckers are ones I want to punch him right in the fucking face because they're the ones. You're having a good time listening to something. You're bobbing and they want to like really impress like some fucking dumped check with fractals and southern. Everybody's fucked already. Don't know what I'm saying. Everybody fucked. All you need is Tequila and a gram of blown she'll be sucking your dick in the fucking bathroom. You want to be cool and let Tom Weigh heavy weight.

Speaker 4:          01:28:24       That's good. Second, you want that. You're a fucking idiot, but the only reason that people would put that shit on is to try to overpower you with that fucking star wars. What do you call that? The fucking thing with the mind. Generous. That's it. Oh, he's so. Oh my God. He likes to listen to that. They're trying to let me sit you down with a gun next to your head. You're telling me. That's good. That's good. Fucking second. Beatles. Y'All fucking shoot. You can put a gun to your bucket. All right. Telling me that's good music. You fucking 20 years old. Not at all. Like when somebody says, I like the Dave Matthews band. I will pistol whip you with. You have satellite on the way up here. Says to me they wouldn't do an accident by Bob Marley. I almost crashed out a white dude with no shoes on. A black new planner. If fucking it's too. It's too made up. Uncle Joey stop it. I think he's got some good songs. Dave Matthews got a few good, so hopefully she got me emotional.

Speaker 4:          01:29:29       Fuck this shit. I was too quiet over there. I hate all that shit. You don't like to just move over. I can't stand fucking time with and the people like Tom Waits, look at them and go to that page and it'll tell you the whole thing like that. That something ain't right, that vegans something. Then, you know, stop the pill. Pilgrims they care for something that you're like, really? I always like to. Tom Waits is a guy who probably has a song that I would like, but I don't want to go find it. Oh, it's probably like one or two songs. One Song. Pick a fucking song, pick a song. And it sounds like he's taking a shit. It sounds like a dude. What the fuck is this? More on singing and I know people going, oh my God, he's a revolution. And I know Paul Mccartney. He's a bad motherfucker.

Speaker 4:          01:30:12       Why? He's alive. Everybody else was dead. Paul Mccartney won this war. That's true. Joe Harris is dead. Everybody's dead. Michael Jackson's dead dead. Paul Mccartney still, even his wife, he killed the fucking. Blew the Lipton chick. What did her parents own? Fucking Kodak Shit, man. When he moved to, he didn't know. He drove it again, a fucking sandwich. He died in a car. Remember dog, nobody. Fuck. Then he had the one with the missing leg. Courtney lives one. This fucking game. We beat out one. Everybody's McCartney outlived everybody. The only one. Him, Elton John Bowlby, Mick Jagger. Which you don't even want to fuck with all those other guys think Mick Jagger's. Filthy motherfucker ain't today. God, I hate that motherfucker. Just look at them. You want to just wrangle mcjagger. Why Mick Jagger's a different dudes. You know Mick Jagger, Mick Jagger. What was his background? I don't know. Like look at his background, his background.

He don't do nothing unless you show up with a big bag book. I know in Boulder, I, we talking about this in the podcast one time in boulder, you know, out in conscious the seats behind you shot him, but Mr Jagger, nobody sells the tickets behind them. They won't mind. I'm Mick Jagger, those tickets so we don't go on stage. You heard that new shit. It's horrible. You sound that bad. That new songs, not the enemy. It's not that. And why would you put up? Let me see where I can find it. Let's help them. Let's promote the rolling stones.

It's getting his dick suck. He's 60 something. You think stallone shooting shit. This guy. Oh, bits lapse alone with his dick.

He fucked over 100 or whatever thousand women, but I believe nobody fuck more women than Sinatra and Mick Jagger like that. That we can only play one little excerpt of it. Not even like a little really damn youtube. That's why we need to work something out with Youtube. Youtube. Hook us up with the new stones is good. Not Bad man. At least like a song, but I don't know what. No more stones. The stones are the biggest business merger ever released. Six old songs and two new ones and they bang it out for another 1995.

Speaker 4:          01:33:39       Dude. Um, when he came back or when it was like, what is it? Like 90, 89, 89 90. They had like one big hit again. What was that one big hat they had? Okay, so 81 was shattered and all that and then after that it was the other one. They took some time off and the came back. Neighbors not that out that it kept going. You guys like Bruce Springsteen? No, thank God that I'm from Jersey. I want to stop that motherfucker too. Yeah, I like some brief. I liked the first. I ain't gonna lie. I like 10th avenue freeze out. I like a darkness on the edge of town, but after that, born in the USA with a pe shirt, him jumping up and down casually tracks. Fuck. You know what I'm saying? Out The ball on what the fuck. Well that's kind of for our show. I don't give up after two hours I got to get out of it was I'm fine. He's like the special people on the east coast that really emotionals songwriting some great fucking songs. Thunder road. That is.

Speaker 4:          01:34:48       But this is what happens. What happens is when a guy gets like super famous, it's really hard to keep up that struggle and so you sort of become at least a partial parody of yourself. Have you seen them lately? Them that fucked up at night. This is a fucking marine is beautiful. He gets on my last bid. If the guy to me still, he was going to run. Man. I love all that shit, but enough already take them in time and they told him he comes out. What doing. He gets on my last fucking type dude. Anyway, motherfucker. And by Jovi, Bon Jovi, Jovi 87. Slippery when wet boy dead or alive. You guys are talking shit because born to run is a thousand times better than any of those songs. So to run this tremendous, tremendous trouble. Bruce Sprint. But I'll tell you what, bruce springsteen, when he had that, the divorce, then he came out with some jamming music man because he like felt like really like broken hearted over this.

Speaker 4:          01:36:01       You know him and this chick break it up. So he came up with that brilliant. The Sky Song. That's a great fucking song. That is a great fucking song. He came back with some strong shit after that chick crushed them. Little girl. We can manage it. No one would ever make that song today. Hey, little girl. Is Your Daddy home? I had a bad desire. What this? Who the fuck would make that song today? Couldn't do that song in the age of the Internet. They would crucify you. They would go after you did the fake Rick Ross last reebok as a sponsor. Did you hear about that? Oh really? Yeah. That's so ridiculous. Sacred for us. Made a some rhetoric about rape. Dosing them with molly. Put Molly in their drink it. You didn't even know it. You know something along those lines and banging asleep. Why would I ever have the desire to Malia check or give it chicken roofing?

Speaker 4:          01:36:57       I'm a dirty animal. Because you got game son. No, that's true. I would have to check if you want to eat a roofie. I had like, I had this little Jew than both of us. She will need roofs on Sundays with me and we freak. She wouldn't let me fucking beat her ass and 69. It was wild, but she know she had like a boyfriend that was in the navy or something. Oh, that's hilarious. And she kept hope alive. Uh, we'd go out, we'd have roofing. We split a roofie because she liked them too. We had to go to the legal road right at the corner. It was like a, it was like an industrial park of that. Some dude like sheet rock. Sheet rock is sheet metal and he sold roofie. She drove me up there. A couple of roofers. We popped on the Lord's Day.

Speaker 4:          01:37:36       We split the fucking roof. We'd go have a couple of Margarita and talk about bad Karma, man. You're selling roofing. It's just here. Go ahead and do it. But I was responsible with the roof, like, like, no, no, no, I couldn't. I'm saying the guy who was selling couldn't imagine doing that to a check. It's not. I'll work hard for it. I'll take it home with an eight ball and then switch it up on you and give you aspects them. You Suck my Dick. You know what, I'll run you through the fucking rules. Egyptians don't give a fuck, but I can't see that. I can never see root sweetie. You, Joey. I'm telling you dog. I think rape is wrong. I'm just saying, I just think it's wrong. I mean, you know, I can't believe you do it. Why can't even watch law and order Svu. I love law and order that I can't watch it as 10 minutes on camera.

Speaker 3:          01:38:24       Watch this shit. Yeah, that's your, your, you know, we all know that happens after a while when you know that a certain amount of violent crime takes place. Then you watch him like bodies on TV. Like I was watching it the other night. It was at the airport and in the middle of the airport there they're playing this uh, one of those shows like law and order Svu or something like that. And I'm, I'm, I'm seeing like, like a body, you know, and um, um, I don't know if it was a commercial, I don't know what the fuck it was, but I was like, well that's pretty graphic. Like who? Who wants to see that? Like who wants to see that now that I'm thinking about it was in an airport or is it in a store? I think it was a store either way.

Speaker 3:          01:38:59       The the, the, the important thing is that like seeing those, those images on those shows where they're repeating over and over and over again. They have always liked graphic images of bodies and pulling things out of bodies and it's like it's pretty intense that you're. You're taking that stuff into your psyche. You're taking that stuff into your, your bank of experiences. I don't like sexual stuff on television early. He believed that the girls making out or let's say I'm watching Diane Sawyer and have like a condom commercial. I'll fucking lose my mind. A condom commercial will bother you.

Speaker 4:          01:39:28       Oh, it's a little pond. Really destroyed tampon commercial. I want to choke myself and my wife was in the room like your rants in the room with some older woman. I was a kid, a Kotex commercial. I would sit down and look fucking straight ahead. Dog. I never get so embarrassed in my life. I don't want them to ask me if I know and I don't want to fuck the. No. The blood comes out. Yes.

Speaker 1:          01:39:49       What

Speaker 4:          01:39:53       and what you pull up there. That's got nothing to do with me. I'm just straight up. Don't even bring it up. You know there's some women that cute. Yeah, they think it's cute. Like hold on. I gotta go. We gotta a Tampon. Listen, I don't want to know. I don't want to love your bleed. You've ruined everything for me and I don't want to know. That's a really volume at. That bothers me. The sight of blood. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. I think decided talking about that. You fucking pussies bleeding around me. That's what I fucking hate when even when they haven't that purse. I got sick to my stomach. I don't want to see a fucking tampon. I don't want to fucking see a Tampon at all. Alright. When I'm watching TV and a tampon commercial comes up. Even when I'm by myself, I feel creepy. That's so weird. Calm and commercials. That new commercial with the chicken head popping out on the fucking thing. Would you put on your finger, have you seen that commercial chicken with the creepy finger try know this is great to relieve stress. You know what meant? I don't want to know about that shit. What the fuck is that?

Speaker 4:          01:40:50       The Zombie. Oh my God. What is that? Is was to put that away. That's broken. That one's broken. That is just that. Don't even get that one fixed this day. Anything bacterial sprays, anything bad. General and television like 10:00 drives me up a fucking. I've never had a period problem. Oh, I'll never had my own period. Well I have my own period every now and then, but I've never had a like a period problem. Like a problem with the girls, period. No, it doesn't bother me at all. I told you the one I had to his day and it was fucked up because my mother had just died and it was the first time a chick called me like that was my first booty call level. I had dated this girl before. She was a cheerleader at Franklin school. I played hoops at Mckinley and we had messed around a little bit.

Speaker 4:          01:41:36       Not really sex, I don't remember Joe. I think I sucked at Teddy's. I knew a brother, you know what I'm saying? Like we were in grammar school, high school and I had sucked attendees or something. I have to like a dance or something and after my mother died I was home for a week and this lady was taking care of me and I get this call one night and it's just chicken. She goes, you know, you want to get together. I was feeling bad, you know, I didn't know. She just told me a little lottery pussy, like my little funeral pussy out of a God funeral. Pushy. But it exists, you know funeral pussy. Yeah. Like after somebody dies in your family, some chick causing such a dick. Really bad like that. Like a, maybe like a, like a women that hang out at comedy clubs and these, I call them groupies.

Speaker 4:          01:42:17       They have sex with Pete. After somebody dies, I'm serious. But I knew her. She probably just called me out of the kindness of my heart that make me feel well. So I walked from 38th street, the 46, grabbed this bitch and walked back to my house on 38th street. I'm all fucking hole and up. We start to take a fan. So I pop up panties off and the Kotex Pussy, it's like a tongue. One of those fucking haunted houses, right. This and I just sat there frozen like I had never seen that before. I had never smelled that before. I had never been around anything like that. My mother had just died. That was traumatic enough. This was just over the fucking woman still alive today. Till this day, I don't even look on facebook because I might kill her because she fucked me up. Joe Rogan fucked me up. I told her to put her pants on. I remember walking home the whole time. I wanted to know how to control myself.

Speaker 4:          01:43:21       Till this day I think about that motherfucker because she thought, I don't know. That's the first time. Haven't seen a woman with her period. And the last I made a fucking point. That's so funny. If I'm. I don't care how old I am, if I'm in a bar, I got a bag of coke and somewhere along the light that chick says she got her period. That's where the conversation and it ends. There's no more talking. They used to have this freak. They used to be this chick. I used to mess around with Hollywood and I knew her cycle. She would have her periods, the 20th to the 25th. I wouldn't answer her calls. Those five nights dog like six or seven nights just to make sure everything cleared and she never figured out. To this day, she's never have. I wouldn't bring. I'm going to waste cocoa pussy. Fuck it. I'll by myself and Jack, but it doesn't. It's still feel good. It just. The way it looks. You don't like the way it looks. I like it.

Speaker 4:          01:44:17       There's blood. Is that bad enough for you? That's fucking blood. It's not bad enough for you right there that you'll fucking blood. No matter what you're doing. You're fucking blood. I know you like it. I know Redmond for this tiny little gravy comes out. I. No, you send them a bitch. That's the problem is you don't want to look the bloods on the Tampon because that's blood that was came out a month ago or whatever. It is. Not a our or whatever it is. It's all dried up and coagulated 93. Yes. Remember in Boston. That was. I never did that get know. That happened after I left, so it was a Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday. Open mic. She did the weekend. Thursday was headline when he did the weekend and then you stayed the week and during the week I would do Monday, faneuil hall, Tuesday some room and fucking quincy, Thursday wooster and then I go back to the ACO ACO or whatever, but the point of the story is one Sunday at that place I met.

Speaker 4:          01:45:15       I had met her before the open mic girl was in the navy, the hotels at club 56 is right next door and she's like, I'm Kinda tipsy and I kind of liked and she had a crush on me. We started swapping sprint. We went next door. That was the first time I was involved in one of those dark light swapping, spit things. Hit somebody in the dark. We were all over the place on the bag and I remember my pants came off, her shirt came off and I'm giving this chicken stabbing, but this chick's pussy was fucking wet as fuck and I'm banging this like a soldier in these days. I had stamina. It's like 98. I was a savage before I got before the belt and Doug, I turned the light on and it was blood everywhere. Yeah. See if felt good. Right. It didn't feel fucking good at all.

Speaker 4:          01:45:54       I knew something wasn't right. I fucked up in the salty. Something that's smoked, something in the fuck. That's probably you motherfucker. I'm on fire. No, no, no, no, no. I'm a water. Do it. You know, I like water. When I go home now I'll take a fucking shower before I go do comedy. I'll take a shower, I take a shower before I go to the gym. That's how fucking clean I am. I've always felt bad when checks can feel bad about it. No, I would never call somebody a blade. Doesn't matter. I don't even get involved. It bothers the fuck. I just read whatever. Oh No, no, it's not. No one's getting hurt and she's fine. A lot of times there are extra horny to five times girls on their periods or if you don't mind, it doesn't bother me. I don't care. It doesn't matter. What am I saying? Shit. I think it feels better. And you change the sheets right after we shut down a towel. You Shit to worry about in this life. I don't think that's one of them ever. Period. We. You make Chicsville bad man. No, I'm not trying to make nobody feel bad. Listen, some people don't like snakes. Snakes. I'm like, how are you equating snakes to have girls? Period? Because I'm saying fucking same thing. Fucking consume your soul. So it's right there. I spell it out for you. Listen to your pussy. Snake, Adam and eve.

Speaker 2:          01:47:11       Not everybody likes the same things in life. You know, people know if you don't, if you can't handle it and your wife, people don't like. Oh yeah, no doubt. I just don't like that. Some just don't like fat guy. So when I bought some checks to, you know, some people don't like, I just never liked it with a member of the time you realized it was probably like in your early twenties or whatever, that some girls not only would light, they want you to come in their mouth and other girls get mad if you come in their mouth. Like, like this is a, there's a, there's a different thing. There's a very different response here. Yeah. You know, like some girls will say don't come in my mouth and you're like, oh, okay. And then other girls in my mouth like, Whoa, for real. Like is she, does she really want that? She tried to trick me like what is it?

Speaker 5:          01:47:53       I think the girl that after you fuck her, she always wants to take a little taste of it. Like almost like every single day.

Speaker 2:          01:47:59       That's a dirty bitch that once a year on Pussy. But she's too lazy to work out stretch. She's too lazy, lazy to become one of those. What are those contortionists? That's what that is. She just likes the taste.

Speaker 5:          01:48:09       The worst is when you're eating out a girl and she is on her period and he don't realize it until the next day and you see like the dried blood all over your face and you go to a store and it's like a clot in her too.

Speaker 4:          01:48:19       I think that's the alcohol and drug problem. Really just how the fuck you not knowing what's going on. You're eating. This girl tastes like a bag of pennies. Like fuck is going on here. It was really, really hot looking like I like all that shit over blood. Blood from fucking vampires. How many fucking. And

Speaker 2:          01:48:53       by the way, the original vampire think about it. If you really think about blade set this motherfucking old. He's out. He's out. Hopefully it'll make blades nine. Yeah. And for anybody who thinks I have a problem with that guy and I never had a problem with that guy. There was supposedly an MMA fight. They were trying. It sounds like bullshit. And other talk about sleep pipes. Yeah. With Wesley Snipes it was not my idea and I didn't. I didn't, you know, I didn't have any animosity towards her car at all. How much time do you did? Three years. Three. You have three fucking years, man. I just for the fucking wheel and not only that, he was willing to pay. They were like, Ooh, doesn't matter. You go in, you're going to jail. Like he admitted that he made a mistake, tried to pay them off, and they're like, no, you have to do time.

Speaker 2:          01:49:34       You have to do time. They put him in jail for three years. You can't just the government, whether you, especially if you're in a position of prominence, like a giant movie star like that. If you run around saying that you're not going to pay taxes that can fuck up everything and they have to make an example of you. It's almost like they have to, you know, because there's a lot of people out there that will argue about the constitutional legality of this and that. And the reality is everybody's paying you gotta pay you. No, it doesn't. No one wrote it down in 17. Seventy six. Okay, but it's 2013. The reality of this situation is that everybody's paying and these people that go, you know, we have found a clause here deep within the constitution that clearly states that what is going on is unconstitutional, unlawful, and they would never have this brought up in a court of law because if this was exposed, it would take down the very empire itself.

Speaker 2:          01:50:22       And people go, fuck, I ain't paying taxes. Let him come get me. I'll start talking. Shit. I start telling them about how the tax code is illegal and not even in the constitution, you know, and they're like telling Leslie Leslie, and next thing you know, I don't know. I don't know if it went down that way. I'm just guessing I'm making shit up. I don't mean to be me, me of the guy. But then next thing you know, he bought into some guy's idea and didn't pay taxes like willfully. And so that was for like a couple of years and when, when they were going after him and like they're trying to, you know, he, he, he won, won but didn't win. He didn't lose. He lost like the second most important one, but I think he was acquitted in the most important one, which was like a conspiracy or something along those lines, but he's still willfully avoided paying taxes and so they put them away for three solid years.

Speaker 2:          01:51:11       You know, when you're 47 years old like he was, that's, that's a long chunk of the future of your life, you know? How much more time do you have? Do you have? Who's the oldest person ever? He's like 1:20 and so we got eight years left, less, less than 80 years and someone just stole three. They stole three and wanting to put you in a cage because you didn't pay them. That is like some of the most gangster shit, like any society can never pull on its citizens. If you don't give us a piece of what you earn, then we're going to put you in a cage. It's not like a debt. It's not like there's some money on the ledger that has to be corrected and you have to eventually re compensate us until we're even. No, no. We're going to lock you in a cage.

Speaker 2:          01:51:53       That's our solution when you get up. Yeah, you're still going to have to pay us. Well, that's a fairly, and that's a fairly victimless crime if you really think about it and the greater spectrum of all the things that goes wrong in this country. That's a fairly victimless crime. I mean, absolutely it's a crime. Absolutely. People should have to contribute to the fixing of the highways and paying police officers and all that jazz, but the idea that someone should be just locked in a cage for that is kind of crazy. I mean, there's people that don't get locked in a cage for assault. There's people that don't get locked in a cage for much more horrible physical things where there's actual real trauma to an individual. There's an actual victim and they don't get locked in a cage for three years. You said the reasons why? Because they wanted to make an example out of him as a person in his position. You know, you can't go to the government going and paint that really can send tags down there. Fuck you. Dave Koresh. If you haven't learned when they want

Speaker 3:          01:52:46       their shit, they get there, fuck it don't matter the government or your fucking constitution, throw that shit out the fucking window and I pity you for even believing that if you fuck up baton up, they're coming to get you. My friend at this point like retracting that is going to be met with furious resistance and the idea that it's not as as really silly. It's almost like at a point in this country where things are so weird that it's almost like one of two things has to happen. Either there's some sort of technological breakthrough that makes it impossible align anymore and then from now on, everybody has to operate like 100 percent. No bullshit. It's either that when we get adapted to that or some fucking walking dead Zombie type situation where we have to reinvent civilization because we just keep going. The way we're going right now.

Speaker 3:          01:53:32       This is. There's so many opportunities for us to trip over our own decks. Just this North Korea thing alone. See what's going on with this crazy motherfuckers just pointing rockets at everybody and Saber rattling and saying, what do they need? They need food. Do they need. They need power, electricity. They need something. Obviously this guy's doing something to get some sort of attention and get some, some people to calm him down. How long can that guy be around for? How long can you have? India and Pakistan hate each other, pointing nuclear arms at each other. Right? Right. They're just like staring at each other, you know? How much longer can people do what they're doing? It's kind of weird. It's like one of two things has to happen. Either we, they've got to figure out some new invention that lets people all realize that we all have like there's repercussions to everyone's actions, positive and negative and everybody has a stake and everything that happens all over the world, whether it's in the Congo or the fucking.

Speaker 3:          01:54:26       The people that are getting run out of the Brazilian rainforest because loggers have moved in. Those guys are douchebags like, let's. Let's be clear about that. Like some people were living in tents. Some guys want to steal their trees like everybody needs to settle the fuck down. We need to look at this globally and the fact that like country shit can happen in the Amazon and the Congo and all these different spots while that happens and we know about it will never be at balance and it seems to me it's like something has to happen that connects everybody. Whether it's a stage of evolution, whether it's a slow progress of things it's we're going through right now that we're where people are getting upset at things right now that they never got upset before. You know, where people are sort of realizing that there were much more connected than than people have ever been before.

Speaker 3:          01:55:09       And if that doesn't like continue on that trend when you've got things like North Korea, when you got things like what's going on in the Congo and you've got really bad spots in Afghanistan. Really bad spots on Iraq and the world is. There's, there's parts of the world right now that are in the apocalypse. They're right there. The apocalypse exists and it's going on right now and while we're all just sitting here living our lives that's taken place and we know it and because we know it, we always feel out of whack. We always feel like if, if the whole world got his shit together, if we

Speaker 7:          01:55:44       human beings figured out a way where no one was fucking over anybody anywhere in the world, no one was murdered. Anybody anywhere in the world, no one was raped. Anybody anywhere in the world that could be possible. If it's possible doing this room, it's possible doing the whole country too late. I already raped the chairman.

Speaker 7:          01:56:03       Does that make sense or am I just too stoned? Go back to. I know that we have had discussions about your fears and you always said that one of your biggest fears was staying healthy when you got older. You didn't want to really, really get old, you know, and well, I don't want my body to feel, feel walking around with a failing body. LemMe tell you something that petrifies me more than anything. You know, nothing scares me. I never wanted to go to jail after 45 through. Yeah, I know all these gangsters and Glorious and they fucking glorifying them. Biography. You know what? They died in the fucking hole. I Know Gloria and Dynamo fucking hole when you're 55 and above. I tell you what, and I knew this when I was 20 at the 55. There's only one thing you should be worried about your grandchildren and your pension to be paid for and that it's amazing that those creeps made it that long and then when you see guys like John Gotti and jail, Sam in the bowl, they let him out.

Speaker 7:          01:56:59       That doesn't show you how to jail. Yeah, but I mean they let him out. Let him out when he was involved and they knew he was involved in at least like how many murders pointed but some insane amount of murders and they let him go because he gave them information on God. But the beauty is that 20, 30 years from now, somebody's going to find the file on Sammy the bull gravano and it's going. It'd be one of the biggest smacks to the American people that you've ever known. Nobody really knew what really happened. Nobody knew that the government wanted it so bad they wanted him. I don't give up. Listen, I don't give a fuck. I want this guy that will do, will he killed 80 people. Fucking there were Italian. They got what they deserved. Fuck them and their mother. That's the thinking, you know, and, and what people don't know is that Sammy was brilliant.

Speaker 7:          01:57:45       The sense that he was the first one. That was the first one to wrap what he did to the government was brilliant. The government knew. I told you that there's the stories that the government was collecting his loan shark payments. When he went away, he went into the system, got out, and then that's when it really blew up in their face because all these people started going and testifying saying, I would never lie. I sold drugs. Uh, Sammy, the bull of government go, no, you didn't. Sammy never sold a drug in his life. But after 50 people came in and said yes, they did. The government finally said, hey, fucking lie, and then that fucking idiot went on, things will be out on the ice. Man went on Hbo. Now this third last interview, he said he killed the cop and then Sammy the bull gravano gave him the yard.

Speaker 7:          01:58:30       They went to the files. They said they seen that he never copped to that cop and lost them. They had to move out with ecstasy ring and they pulled him into jail and the ice band mysteriously died to tell his story to prosecute Sammy. They took the ball and they put them in Colorado in Tomahawk, under the fucking prison, under the prison. So the government, this is a king. He never sees the light, never sees light again, but the government didn't give a fuck when they cut the deal, and that's not just with him. They do this all the time, but it's a different government. That's the thing. It's like the people that are in charge today and not the people that put Sammy the bull out on the street back during the daytime, most likely five fucking years. He got for killing 20 people and they got to take his money.

Speaker 7:          01:59:16       Yeah, you got to take $10,000,000 and he got to. They didn't care. And then they put him in if he was in Phoenix. Right. And then he didn't even try to go under a fake name or something like that. He told him to go fuck himself or he told him to come and get them. That's how crazy. That little mother, five foot five training with Teddy Atlas. Five days a week. She is the ball default. Fuck. Did you see him before? Huge. Did you see him when he got nailed? He looks scary. He was five, five to something. Who's a human bulldog? He was, you know. And he was fighting every morning over that with Daddy Alice. That's the truth to the outlets was his training. Wow. Yeah. That was a scary time when you have like real legit mafia criminals like flaunting it and New York. What about what's going on?

Speaker 7:          02:00:00       I ain't your shit about how they just, you know, I shouldn't say this, how they, they arrest the Arabs in New York and try to flip the things on them and try to get those terrorists case. What are they doing? I don't know. We had a discussion about they take the people that go and push, they'd take Arabs and they go and push them in on those terror groups. Well they did that and then I gave the guy, I think it was Dallas, they gave a guy a fake bomb and they uh, they had um, tried to detonate it when you tried to detonate, they're arrested for trying to detonate a bomb. Like, like you gave them the bomb, like, you know, and I mean that's so crazy. The idea that they would be able to make a fake bomb. Get it to you. Let's do this.

Speaker 7:          02:00:38       Let's do the compensation. Okay sir, my friend bumper, you know I'm going to give it to you. You're the bomb guy. Well, I think he thought he was dealing with a terrorist organization. He gets to know he was dealing with the FBI. He had some FBI guy, who is his. This, my friend, uh, medicat is devil. We're going to take it down. You are in, you are an important part of our program. This guy's an idiot. He's like, I'm an important part. Finally something. Anything. What do I do? Is that an offensive voice? Offensive or stereotypical Arab type dude voice? What do I do? I don't know. So what do you think? Uh, how do you think it went down? Said to him. That's a good angle. What do you think? You said you take this and you put it in. When you come back, we'll give you a badge and they probably be like Mpi, benching and everything. The guys like you. It shouldn't be $55,000 a year to start benching and God and God, that's only, that's only going to be back. That's so he planned ahead. He was that type of person. All the governments always two steps ahead of you though. I think the guy was probably like, if I do

Speaker 4:          02:01:40       this, you'll be my friend. What are you plan a terrorist music. That's music. If it's, you know, a terrorist music. Is that John Ashcroft song that's fucking terrorist music? No one's terrorism, bro. Subway Sandwich. How is that? Tara was thinking I was in Nashville, you know, across the street from Nashville. It's a subway sandwich right there, right. I'll fucking coolest Nashville. Xannies national am I fucking around and it's nice people. Cool. Nashville's a attached was as a fucking cool tap. Yeah. But I was looking at that stuff and I'm like those motherfuckers. So Turkey fucking Salami. Turkey Salami, right. You know, they do such bad shit. I don't even give you a full foot. Yeah. Did you hear it? See, it looks like I knew it was fucking me. When you get six inches, that's when you know a ton of sense because I worked on lumberyard for fucking years.

Speaker 4:          02:02:34       Six inches more like what? Second? In short, the whole foot longs. I got it. I fucking talk to sit at one time and then they got mad. They got food poisoning from the tuna. The tune is bad and I got at one time. I liked the tuna for years, but I. You can't say that I'm podcast, we're gonna. Get in trouble. No, I'm just telling me, allegedly saying that someone should sell the post office to a private contractor to run it like dps and thought what the fuck and this guy written up. The comedy store is what happens when we take a few days up the health department on that way right now. I'm not going to store. Yeah, you got a problem. He's in there with a fucking. I want you to take a bus. Patient Shit.

Speaker 4:          02:03:17       They arrest him as a girl enters into that bathroom. Security is hovering over the window looking in. You're such a fucking man. You just fucked everybody who has a part of that place. Brian, you really did. You're a terrible mother fuckers for years. We're looking at something, looking at pussy. I can't even dream. How can you be such a fucking thing? You know? I judge everybody by my actions. At least discuss those. Look in the fucking pool. Ladies Pussy do a fucking thing. And to even looking. I mean, I don't understand. I really don't. That's the thing about any open institution, whether it's a comedy store or a park where kids hang out and you're going to get going to get all kinds of people. You're going to get real friendly people and you get to get people that suck. You know, and at the comedy store, you've got to have both of that too. You know, we've always had those few comedians that would come around and you're like, Jesus Christ, you got a back up and move away and just like they have bad mojo and they're all upset that, you know, why am, why am I on this time? And Joey Diaz is on at this time, this is bullshit. And they stomp around. You always get that right. Always.

Speaker 2:          02:04:38       Always put the people put cameras, have bathrooms other places. I see it all the time. I didn't Chuck Berry get in trouble for doing that or the steak houses. And so chuck Berry, I believe, got in trouble for doing that. I should probably look that up, putting the fucking tape in the backroom and then go and what are you doing? Excuse me, go back. At the end of the day and empty the camera looking at people pissing. Why are you asking me? I don't know. Because you went into all that shit out because I can't say that. I don't want to say the. How dare you? Well, if you take a pee at Brian's house, he's watched. No, I'm not just saying that. Motherfuckers watching those iphone, I gave him the banana bread. I caught him with his phone off you gotta he was taping somebody at the ice house. This motherfucker, he got like eight cameras all around this. Oh this is so not true.

Speaker 8:          02:05:17       But I, I get that I was talking to a comic that we are all friends with a or, and he's like, I want to send you something because I was talking about the maps website and uh, he, he goes, I have something to send you. And he gives it and take it. And it was like a two things have keys like key chains and they're like the little, uh, things for your car, for the alarm. And I'm like, why is he sending me this car? And I opened it up and it's a camera and what you do is you put it on your key chain and so then like when you're somewhere like a massage parlor or something like that, you hit record and just put down your keys and that records hd video. He just sent it to me. He's like, oh, trust me, I have the greatest thing for you.

Speaker 2:          02:06:01       Okay, I got it. I got it. Totally wrong. Story of Chuck Berry. Chuck Barry did a lot of wacky shit, but that's not one of them. One of the things he did in 1959, he was arrested out of the Mann Act that he had sex with a 14 year old waitress from which he transported over state lines to work as a hat check girl at his club. Fourteen year old, 14 year old. Which race he was convicted, fined $5,000 and sentenced to five years in prison. His appeal of the judge's comments and the attitude were racist and prejudice by the jury against them was upheld. And the second trial was held in May and June of 1961, which resulted in barry being given a three year prison sentence after another appeal failed. Barry served one year, one and a half years in prison from February of 1962 to October of 1963.

Speaker 2:          02:06:50       He pleaded guilty to tax evasion, was sentenced to four months in prison, a thousand hours of community service doing benefit concerts in 1979. And in 1990 he pleaded guilty to misdemeanor possession of marijuana law. The last one that got him for wheat, they should've looked at as legend going. This guy's done enough time. She's transferred. He said, listen, maybe listen to not let me go to suck my Dick. But I got a job as a motherfucker had checked. 14, 14 year old hat check girl. Holy Shit. Wow. Chuck Berry was a bad motherfucker, you know, that was a totally different time in the world too. But that's the racism that guy felt. What about the gun? I played the piano. He fucked his cousin. And so red band. What's that? What's? Come on guys. Who are you talking about that, that, that, that Jerry Lee Lewis?

Speaker 4:          02:07:36       Yeah. He fucked his cousin. And he might've, uh, the allegations were that at one point in time that he killed his wife.

Speaker 2:          02:07:46       It wasn't, it didn't. He? Uh, he get in trouble. That's what they call them. The killer. That was actually, isn't it?

Speaker 4:          02:07:53       What's so funny? He's so fucked up on edibles. You can tell high right now, but I didn't smoke pot for over a week. You didn't? I didn't swipe up for the show. Now we're, we're off the deep end. Let me tell you something. So this guy, fuck this cuts. Killed this. Yeah. Someone drown. Like one of his wives drowned. Yeah. But you know, she could have just drowned. Man, you know, might not have been. What? Are you doing, you guys slandering? No, no, he was so crazy. Jerry Lee Lewis was so fucking crazy that him and chuck berry, we're doing a gig together. And uh, Chuck Barry Played Piano too, right? I think so. Yeah. Yeah. So was it, was it was chuck Berry that he lifted his piano on fire? That liberace? No, no, no. That's a

Speaker 2:          02:08:36       didn't Jerry Lewis? It was Jerry Lewis falsified, but Jerry Lewis lit chuck Berry's piano on fire. I don't remember that. I think he did. I think. I think he did and I think he said like, follow that motherfucker like you lit the piano on fire. I'm pretty sure I need to pull that up because maybe I'm just combining scenes in movies. Jerry Lee Lewis. Chuck Barry. No, not. He was crazy man. Which one? Jerry Lewis. Jerry Lee Lewis was crazy. He was crazy. Yeah. That guy was nuts. Yeah. He had a fight. He got in a fistfight with Chuck Berry. Yeah. Jerry Lewis. Jerry Lee Lewis. Chuck Berry feud. Yeah. These were. I mean, think about these types of people. I mean, these are wild motherfuckers. Just Jerry. Just just thinking Chuck Berry. Thank you. Get in a fight with a guy like Chuck Perry. He's doing time. Does a year and a half in the pokey for transport and the girl across state lines. Apparently he sinks of Asian.

Speaker 5:          02:09:44       Apparently caught the piano of fire. Then walked off stage telling Barry, follow that n word in order to. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          02:09:51       to intention. If he actually did say an inward fall, that n word, it was a sad time, sad time

Speaker 4:          02:09:58       and that that whole lifestyle, golden to prison and coming out. Oh yeah. I love Chinese food. Too much walking around too much. Fuck you. Especially in the sixties, especially the sixth. Especially doing title give. They all listen. Anytime that you glorify on television, that's bullshit. You still want to see your family to be 65 and Olivia whole life and think that you were a gangster and to get put in jail when you're 50 and have to be 67 in fucking prison. Let's say nobody gonna rape you. They beat you up. Just the thought. Just being

Speaker 7:          02:10:34       freedom removed and you see these idiots on discovery channel. Like when they do it was prison. It shows them, and I'm on the road, I'll stay up late writing, but I put that channel on and I watched the interviews of these guys like, yeah, you know I did it. What the fuck did you do? You fucking pissed away a life. Pissed away. A fucking light. You do two, three years when you're 18, that ain't shit. Joe Rogan. Anybody could do it. Standing in the fucking head.

Speaker 2:          02:10:55       Did you hear about that guy that they just arrested that was living in the woods of Maine by himself? He hadn't talked to another person in 30 years and he had been surviving all this time by stealing things from campgrounds. Didn't talk to people for 30 fucking years until the, uh, the police finally arrested him. So he was basically like a fucking kid and just disappeared. He, yeah, 27 years. He lived in the woods for 27 years. He didn't speak to another person. He just lived in the woods, snuck into camp grounds, stole shit, and went back to his camp. And so they arrest this guy. He's got this a spot and they have all these pictures of it. Um, if you go to the Kennebec Journal, Kj online.com, Kennebec K and N, b e c and e, b e c k e n n e b e c. it's a part of Maine where this guy was a Kennebunk port, right? Where her, that's where a Bush had his compound out there, his family, the older Bush, but this guy man was just live in like a character in a movie by himself, not talking to any human beings and then in the middle of the night, stealing people's shit. Pretty nuts.

Speaker 7:          02:12:09       Rosters death on the fucking night with the dog.

Speaker 2:          02:12:13       This is a really amazing man. That's fucking crazy. Especially in Maine. Maine is unfucking. Bearably cold in the winter. It's really, really cold. New York is called, is cold, colder Maine as a motherfucker. Is that feeling when you get out of your car, you just get. It's a totally different kind of is show what the inside of his heart look like. Yeah, yeah, yeah. They got a video. There's a video up there of this guy's place. It's got all things hanging. You know, everything's hanging from a wall even as a clock that he's getting taped up to a tree, stole someone's clock, like stole all this shit and just like packed, crowded into this weird sort of tent that he has set up in the middle of the main fucking all kinds of people. Man, no, he lit fires and shit. We were starting to see because of the we can get a story like this online so easily and read into it that you've never had anything like this 20 years and he never got these stories.

Speaker 2:          02:13:08       They didn't show it on 20 slash 20 or on one of those. You never really got like this sort of an in depth look at wackiness and we're getting it every day. Every day there's like some new dude. It gets caught doing something really fucking weird and then you look at them and you go, who is this crazy fuck? What's going on here? And then you'll forget about them because tomorrow it's a dude has got a pet hippo that he rides around until it eats them and then he'd go what a fucking weighed them and then the next day it's another story. It's just, it never ends. The guy walks into home depot yesterday and tried to cut his arm off here that I walk into. Home Depot picks up a saw and starts hacking his fucking arm off God down to the bone, screaming hot, fucking in cutting his arm.

Speaker 2:          02:13:47       They got down to the bone until they stopped him. Wow. What the fuck? Really? Joe Diaz. I'll stop and thinking about that for a moment. I kind of walks into home depot and saws his own fucking arm off. Can you imagine being in this shit? Why you go in there just to get a gallon of paint. You got to put up with this fucking guy now doing this. It's just you. You might be there in the wrong place. Wrong time. When that guy does that or does something even nuttier that harms other people, you know, I would like to find out what that guy was on. You know, I would love to know what these guys. Life Tail. I guarantee life. That's it. They lost a mortgage. They lost the house. The wife left. The kid is on drugs. The other kid's a fucking moron. God knows because a lot of that.

Speaker 2:          02:14:35       There's a lot of life going on, man. It's tough for people right now. You know, you really think about what's going on. They got missiles pointed at us, whatever the fuck, listen, if he launches them, I'm sure United States and do what they can and will will be fine. It's just the thought that it's right there. It's right fucking there were about to be part of this. Everything will change everything. You know, what people don't realize who haven't been over there like you and I, we don't. We don't realize what the actual conditions are in that country. And when you read about it, it almost seems like fiction, you know, when you read about the slave camps and people were born in the slum camps and you know, some of them escaped and they tell these stories of like how weakened they let people get and then they like literally like people are eating rats and shit trying to stay alive.

Speaker 2:          02:15:23       We have North Korea slave camps. It's horrible. Horrible Shit. Why is that a slave camp? Because I dunno man. Well they vice.com exposed that they have slave camps in Siberia. The North Koreans have a slave camp in Siberia and the people in Siberia, they don't even know that they're not in North Korea. They think they're in North Korea, but really they're in a slave camp in Siberia. It's really fucking crazy. And what would I can't wrap my head around? I don't think, and I don't think either you can, you, is that these people are living like Stalinist Russia. They're living like a real communist dictatorial sort of, you know, you big view of the world, you know, their idea of, of life is they have dear leader. You know when people didn't cry for dear leader, you don't want. The guy died. People didn't cry. I got sentenced to six months in jail. They sent some people to jail because they didn't cry. So people like if you ever see the video of people crying, it is the most ridiculous overproduced, overactive nuttiness that you've ever seen in your life. It's people just terrified. It's really sad to watch because these people are terrified and

Speaker 3:          02:16:30       they're wandering around crying, just wailing. It's so fake looking. It looks so fake, but it's like they have to put on a show that the government is so, it's, they're, they're so controlled. It's such a horrible dictatorship that the, if you're not crying for the Guy Dying, they just throw you in a fucking cage. Yeah. The balance of power for whatever reason, people always want to get to that sort of total dictatorial position. Like even the guy who, uh, who was the overthrowing of the government in Egypt, the new people that came in were like adults and I don't think the law should apply to us and we're going to do. And everybody was like, what? Like there was like riots in the street. They're like, well, this is what we just got rid of. Like you're trying to do exactly what the government before you like.

Speaker 3:          02:17:16       I see where you're going with this. He crazy fucks. It's almost like a slave camp. What is the purpose of a slave? They're making them where they're working. They're making things, whatever it is. I mean, North Korea has almost no money there. They're unbelievably broke. If you fly over North Korea at night, the lights are out. They shut their lights off at night, whereas you go to South Korea, looks like any other part of the world. We see people's lights on. North Korea doesn't even have enough money to keep the lights on me. It's a, it's an uh, it's terrible. You can't run a country like that. They're not going to profit. They're not going to prosper. Like the only way to have a really strong economy is you have a lot to, a lot of people that are trying to make things happen. Not just like the people that are in charge and then their slaves.

Speaker 3:          02:17:53       You can't run it like that. You know, you can't run it where you, the entire civilization is under your heel because a strong man is going to prosper. A strong woman is going to prosper and anybody that knows they're under the heel of the government like that. They're never going to prosper. So the economy is never going to be vital. It's never going to be like no one's going to be out there trying to make shit happen and kick ass and take names and you know, and, and, and keep the, the economy energized. They're fucking terrified. They're terrified of jackbooted thugs coming into the house and locking them in a cage because they weren't fake crying enough, you know, and it's 2013. That's the funniest part about it. So this is happening right now, just like you and I are taking fucking southwest to San Jose and having a good time and fucking driving to Vegas and waving at people at the gas station.

Speaker 3:          02:18:36       These fucking people in another part of the world right now are living in a horror movie. Fucking amazing. You imagine men living in a horror movie. I mean you, you literally are living in Star Wars. They might as well be stormtroopers. That might as well be darth vader. You really are. That means they have nuclear power. They have nuclear power and machine guns, tanks, and they're all willing to walk in a straight line without lifting the leg up at the same time. Which is scary for us when everybody moves mindlessly in a unit together. Left, right, left, right. That scares the shit out of us because that means you're willing to do whatever the fuck they tell you once they got you marching like that left, right, left, right? Well, you can't just walk in carrying guns. How impressive is that? Let me tell you something. Just walk in carrying those guns and it was going to shit their pants anyway, but you're walking in with that. The sergeant, Sergeant Carlos.

Speaker 2:          02:19:28       What is that? Yeah, what is that? You're letting people know that you've got these motherfuckers under control completely under control and you're doing that while you're in this nightmare of a dictatorial society. It's got to be horrific to live over there. She rolled the dice. Oh, I was so pissed because I got to go. So lucky. So lucky [inaudible] one on one at 5:00 and pisses me the fuck off. So there's no traffic like New York traffic. How bad is it? God? It's just like, all right, this dress, it's very bad. I read this. I can't believe it will go over. That's why I said to you, the tunnels and bridges and getting into the tunnels and bridges can be insanity. Insanity. It can be like, okay, this was not happening. Like how long does this take? It's craziness. The amount of humans and by the way, no one's driving. Okay. Everyone's taking cabs, so if most of the people in the city are taking cabs, it's the rare few that are clogging it up like this. The amount of traffic does not need even closely represent the amount of actual humans. Luckily because the amount of humans is staggering, but most of them are not taking cars.

Speaker 7:          02:20:37       I'm explaining something to you and 94, I was doing comedy and I went back. That was an open mic or I lived in New Jersey. I dated a girl on 15th and Ninth Avenue by Honda of Manhattan. Joe Rogan. I'm telling you I could get into my car to coordinate and be in Manhattan at 10 after eight. You know me know how the fuck is. I pick her up. My show would be at nine in the New York comedy club. About three years ago. I went into New York City, I had to pick my buddy up at the bus station. I'd never seen anything like that while I thought it was going to take me an hour, tops took me four fucking hours. I'm not shocked. I don't know that. Then there's nothing I want to do that anymore. I want to go get a hotdog. I take the bus and the train over, but I'm either taking them are over. Those days are done.

Speaker 2:          02:21:24       I was hanging out with Shane Smith from vice.com or right. He lives in New York and he has this view window that it's like mountains. It doesn't even seem real. His, his view is like, it's like you're looking at like mountains. They're mechanical mountains that people create. It's more beautiful even than the mountains that the New York City skyline is fucking staggering. It's so impressive that it's almost worth being there just to see it on a regular basis because it really is like a work of art just like the mountains are. You know, the reason why people are willing to pay for paintings and shit because it makes you feel good when you see something bad ass when you look at something, something beautiful like this sculpture that this gentleman sent me, the Buddha for my tattoo that um, I, I love art. I like looking at shit that someone made, you know, I'd like, I like things that are beautiful, but the New York City skyline, it's like one of the most beautiful things you could see.

Speaker 2:          02:22:18       Like when that thing is all lit up and the cars are moving, you're like, Whoa, I've never seen a pain that makes me do that. I never see a painting. I see a painting. I go, wow, that's cool. I like that. Oh, that's bad ass. But I never see a pain that makes me sit down and open my jaw and go, whoa. But the New York City skyline will make you go, Whoa, and make you sit back. If you look at it from one of those dudes, it's got some crazy building with a giant window. And like a lot of those people that have those like 180 degree views like people with like crazy cash and giant apartments, they're view is the greatest view in the world. The view is amazing. Seeing all that, that skyline, those lights and the cars moving. I totally get it now. I totally get it.

Speaker 7:          02:22:59       They have to live in there. That's the main thing. Like I told you to live in New York is live like John Lennon. If you're living there, you're like John Lennon. It's not. It's fucking tough. That's tough place to live. They've have to commute from Brooklyn to Manhattan. You know? It's fucking tough.

Speaker 2:          02:23:16       Well, John Lennon is a perfect example though. Why? What's crazy about it? I'm dudes just waiting outside to where he knows you live. Some wacky dude that wants to shoot you. You know what I mean? That's a secured building. Yeah. It doesn't matter. People know that you live in that secured building and you're John Lennon. I mean John Lennon was one of the most famous human beings on the planet earth. They didn't care if this guy's living in this building too, naughty way to live, stacked on top, everybody but God so beautiful. And we were there and there was a lightning storm broke out. Fucking a man to be on the 40th floor of a hotel and look out the window. You see lightning dance across the sky. It's like, holy fuck. This is one of the coolest shows you could ever see. It was amazing. New York has stopped. That really moves me. You know what? The terrorists dog subway sandwich fucking. They already got something up. They already got that up. They already got a meme up.

Speaker 2:          02:24:14       People would not friendly there though, man. That's, that's the weird thing is the dealing with that constant stress that went away after nine slash 11, after nine slash 11. People were super friendly there for awhile. We filmed fear factor there and like 2002 I think. And um, when, maybe it might've been 2003, but everybody was so friendly. It was, it was really interesting. It was like when we went there, people were like, you could noticeably see that there was like an extra effort that people made to be nice to people that felt it. It was like a fountain in the air and I remember thinking, hmm, how long will this last? You know, like this is a new change of the way people are behaving in New York. I want to. How long it lasts. It lasts a long time. It lasted quite a few years before I started feeling like it was back to normal again. This last trip back to normal. Solely back. Yeah. People are. They just some people. I mean there's plenty of Nice folks in New York just like this, playing Nice folks everywhere. We met a lot of Nice folks.

Speaker 7:          02:25:09       The funny thing is when I walk in New York, there's some stuff that just fucking moves me. It moves me because I remember coming off from Cuba and walking in and being a little kid. I'm a walking down Broadway and seeing the first wall poster to her secret service.

Speaker 2:          02:25:24       That's a James Bond movie with in between James Bond. His name was George Lazenby. He was in between Roger Moore, I guess. Really? Yeah. Yeah. Look it up. Diana Rigg Kojak was in the movie. It's called our majesty's secret service. Came out in 1969, maybe 68, maybe 70. How many James Bonds were there? The new ones. The best. That guy is fucking bad ass. Bad Ass. He's the best. He was. He's good. But Roger Moore's good to Roger Morris. Good live and let live. And let my Roger Moore can fuck with Sean Connery and Roger are. These are the men. David Nivon was the first one. Oh No, no, no, no. Let's listen to this church. This is crazy. Barry Nelson was the first one in 1954. Even before sean connery. So Sean connery was 62 to 1971. And again he came back, don't call it a comeback and 83 took a 12 year hiatus and then came back with a new wig.

Speaker 2:          02:26:23       And then there's David Nivon who fucks David Nevon. They tried David Nevon out in 67, right? That shit didn't work. And then they tried George Lazenby and tried that out in [inaudible] 69, the movie. And then there's another guy, Christopher Kazen, cazenove cazenove because yeah. See it's, it's, it's Ca z e n o v e and then Roger Moore from [inaudible] 73. Which ones at Roger More live and let die to. Good question. But do you remember Timothy Dalton and Pierce Brosnan? There was two duds in a row to like fucking total duds out here, man. Like the same person. It's probably Timothy Dalton was talking shit. And I love to. We've got Pierce Brosnan on speed dial. Bronson would probably be good, but get out. Fuck out of here at both those guys. I can imagine those guys kicking anybody's ass ever. I imagine them getting hit and just start crying. But Daniel Craig, I could see that guy kicking someone's ass.

Speaker 2:          02:27:21       I totally 100 percent, but I think he's the best one of all time. He's a beast. He like, he seems like a killer. Like when I'm watching them, it seems like the type of guy who would be like a problem drinking womanizing, trained killer. Like it all came together in the most realistic version of it, but I had a lot of people said it sucked, man. It's funny. There's dude posted on the message board that I go to. How fucking everybody told them was the best bond era is like, holy shit was at a piece of garbage and I was like, man, I didn't get that. I thought it was. It was Roger Moore's shotgun before you fuck out of here. I'm telling you dog live and let die. Roger. I'm telling you that that was a Rogan. I was just puking the whole time. He had his finger up your ass. That's the whole thing about those guys. That's what it means to be fucking James Bond. That's what it means. That's right. The Suave, debonair, finger up your ass. He was a swab that I'm telling you. I didn't think so either. See, I grew up on the saint when the saint was popular when I moved here. So it was the Saint Roger Moore.

Speaker 4:          02:28:23       The saint was a TV show with a circle around his fucking. That shit the fuck. No, no, no, no, no. That was the watch. Roger Moore. The is yet he has his own TV show. Yeah. He had a halo. Yeah. That was the commercial for that. What's the name of the show? The mentalist. A mentalist. Ain't. Oh, that is so funny.

Speaker 4:          02:29:10       Yes. What was that guy's name? That was the curly haired Brunette boost. What's his name? I'm like, this battery off my shoulder. Will Smith came back to play it right? He played it later. Another assault me place. I'm not talking about black people in the wild. Wild West there, right? It was two white dudes. The guy's name. Remember the seventies? That commercial knocked that battery off my shoulder. He, he, he tough shit. Remember that series was 65 to 69, which was the wild west TV series. Sixty five to 69 and the guy was right. It was Robert Conrad and his buddy Ross Martin who get never get any credit, man. Ross got the shaft. Nobody gets any credit. Dammit. That was a good show. I didn't know it was only four years. I used to love that show when I was a little kid. The wild, wild west.

Speaker 4:          02:30:04       Don't please. I remember that was w or the wild wild west. It takes a thief. Those or channel nine shows that channel 11 shows where the honeymooners. Y'All couple Sanford and son the twilight zone. So you had them all and. But my Benny Hill was on war. That was the beginning of my comedy career watching. Hell, if you're not a fan, I can't talk to you if some way you don't look at me and go, yeah, but Joel, you're a fucking animal tip was going to pop out you. She comes once a week. Somebody showed that debt on television didn't actually show a real tip, bro. They showed something or at least you will go crazy. You will go crazy. Everybody in school knew the next day. Everybody got to make sure that, man, I think you guys hallucinating. I don't think they ever actually show. He'd close. They got pulled it out when you were 11. You lose. Your face gets red. You get dizzy. Yeah, you would get sick. Couldn't believe it's happening. There's certain shows that were awesome for kids. You know that like if like I guess that's how we're looking at things today. You know, we look at shows that are terrible and like what the fuck is watching us? But like for a little kid they show it's still be pretty bad ass, but the biggest rush, my biggest crush ever was with Alona from good times.

Speaker 7:          02:31:20       In fact, I still see that fine black bitch distance like tyler, you sexy motherfucker. She goes on. In fact you shouldn't buy lady. And she's still banking with a guy. Who was that? The black chick from a good time. Well known. Another one that lives upstairs to the check. She was beautiful. She still wasn't fucking knockout. But then the other one died, right? Shirley and Shirley temple. Was she from good time though? She was from John One, the one with a rerun. Which one was that? That was the one with rerun on it. You know those fucking people. You sure? Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Shirley effort was on a

Speaker 2:          02:31:55       what's happening. Right, right, right. What happened? What's happening? Can't it kicking in as well? What is kicking at me? Bulking. So when you look back on shows some, some shells. Fucking hang in there man. So like all in the family still hangs in there, you know, it still hangs in there. Print songs. Prince songs are still fucking bad at. I was in the store and uh, I want to be a lover. Came on and I was like, wow, I haven't seen this is like 1980, wherever the fuck it was 81 or something like that. And I was like, this song is still bad.

Speaker 7:          02:32:28       Go. I'm going to tell you what was on the way up here. You motherfuckers. I was in a car, I didn't give a fuck about traffic of the Joe Rogan experience. You don't want it as bad as the one later on. Oh, a boom, boom, boom.

Speaker 2:          02:32:44       Oh yeah, boom. Yeah, that's a great sign sign of the Times

Speaker 7:          02:32:49       time. But it's a great song. All that thing he was doing in vegas where it was a like you would pay 500, 200 people at the, at the Pearl. I guess. I'm not sure. People all attack me like, yeah, he would do so a really small bank for a lot of money. $500. But you got to call the songs. Wow, that's awesome. And you would say, you know, I just, I always look, look, kid rock to you might be some fucking redneck. Okay. And I. and he probably is and his uncle does math or whatever, but it doesn't really matter. One thing about kid rock is he knows music. You know, one thing about comedy is I may not be the funniest guy in the world, but I love watching old comedy to see where I came from. Jonathan. Yeah. Jonathan winters talking. Why I, I'm a big fucking a Bruce Guy and you know, Jackie gleason, I love to watch that stuff and when I talked to somebody and when you talk to somebody you might not like something about them, but just the people they admire, you understand where they come from.

Speaker 7:          02:33:46       We're talking about this earlier, but if somebody sold you on twitter and you go to that page and go, I get it, you know what I'm saying? They were riding around with a wig on or some shit. I understand now why they repeated this with the same thing with me with comics, you know like what you all combined. So I like to know what people like you, we talk about x and your dad was thinking about it because one of my influences also was Lenny Clarke believable telling you I love Lenny Clark and he become a major star. Whatever. Yeah. To me he was because he made me get off my fucking ass. I liked what he was doing onstage. You know, Lenny, the other guy from Washington. I like to. There's a couple of guys from Boston I really, really fucking like that. They might not be stars to you, but they're stars to me. I thought so, you know?

Speaker 3:          02:34:31       Yeah. There was a, you know, we came from an era. There was a lot of great comics from like the eighties and nineties, like we were talking about Ira. We don't get recognized today. There was some guys that was, there was some goddamn killers. Teddy bears. Teddy bears on is one. It doesn't get nearly enough credit because he tripped over his own addictions in his life, but that guy at times so was like one of the best comics I've ever seen him

Speaker 7:          02:34:52       tell you something. I listened to an old Hedberg out and I had to stop and check myself when I realized how bad I really was as a fucking comment. I was listening to him in the car, the idea of the college challenge. Nashville fucking what a great town. Just try me. I got a great hamburger. The guy night this place. Jimmy Kelly's. You thinking about moving now? I don't know. That humidity got me. It's hot. It gets hot. That's it guys. That's it guys. That's the. That's the, that's the one in Nashville itself is safe, but

Speaker 3:          02:35:22       when I was there I was talking about how you drive 50 miles in any direction and you're in a Zombie movie and really it's what it's like when you're driving through the dark areas of Tennessee. Like he can get through some weird

Speaker 7:          02:35:33       motherfuckers don't know dark. I love what you athletic athletic. That's my says, but I went to a spot where my in laws are from Myelin and all that. What Mike? He's from Trenton and all that shit. Motherfuckers don't know nothing. You know what nighttime is? Yeah. You have no idea. Gentlemen outside the door and I saw the wolves. They just drew wolves everywhere to get the deer population down, but they kill them something else now and every night and my inlaws got the dog. I tightened the fucking balcony. I'm like, what the fuck? And there's not one was yellow ones. I always, I think they did. They brought them in to keep the deer population populations not. I mean that fucking amazing. So monsters to eat the food. This is what I'm saying. So now that you know they killed something else, now all they were killing the rabbits.

Speaker 7:          02:36:21       Oh God. Did we kill him? The fucking rabbits. So one night you could hear my dad. I'm 50 yards them. That's so crazy. Fucking crazy. Fucking crazy. So that was wild. I liked that style of living. But man, let me tell you something. Listen to me, tell you something. My friends to know that like I wanted a cup of coffee one night. I didn't want to bother nobody because this time I usually stay at a hotel but it's too far. It's too fucking far from the house. I mean they're out there. Joe Out there, right? Just beautiful land is paid for. Gorgeous. But they're out there like that. I was like, Terry, I'm thinking this place. She goes, you know, you get a cup of coffee, it's 40 minutes each way, like 30 or something. Thirty minutes and you but you don't know where you're going. So it's going to be 45. Here's question. What's

Speaker 3:          02:37:15       more healthy that or New York because I don't know because sometimes sometimes I think New York is more healthy, but in being there just for over a couple of days and comparing the pace of certain places that I've been to like boulder and then comparing it to New York and dealing with the people and I don't think, I don't. I can't say it's like New York people are shitty people, you know, it's, it's not at the percentage of the people that I ran into was very, very small that, that were not nice, but those you might not ever run into in boulder. You know what I'm saying? It's that the possibility of like rudeness was there in a way that isn't in other spots. So I gotta think about, well, why are people like that? Like what is it? What is it that causes people to be rude? Is it just, there's too many of us? What? What is it? I think that's part of it. I really do. I think there's a certain number of people when you get stuck in a certain amount of traffic and a certain amount of lines and certain mental waiting, a certain amount of frustration is not worth it. Everybody, everybody just

Speaker 7:          02:38:14       right now at one time or another, the voices got loud with somebody at some point. Oh yeah. Yeah. That's the answer to why people are rude. The problem with us as we call it in New York, there's just so much. I still have it. I still have that time, so I have. I grew up in that mentality in me. It's Lubbock. I am. I get it, but I don't get it all the time. I don't get somebody being mean to you have the fucking belt. There's a difference between route. In fact, there's some rootedness that you appreciate. You're like, thank fucking God. We've got more people like that around to make this lady push a little bit. You know what I'm saying? But that there's another type that rudeness I can't live with at this point in my life and when I was younger I confronted with confront it. Now I don't confront them anymore,

Speaker 3:          02:39:04       but then on the other hand, he got around New York. People are more street smart. They just are. There's people that are hipper. They they like, like they just seem to be more on top of things, you know, the less obsessed with Hollywood. I think that's a really bad thing about the area we live in.

Speaker 7:          02:39:21       Well, that's good. Worse. That's what I ripped the worst over and over and over again. That in this area, particularly with. Listen, this is very funny because I didn't think about this. I was onstage. I dare you Brian. I dare you to get a fucking parking ticket and be 45 minutes late to court. I, Danny motherfuckers to be late to court and Steve, you don't get a bench warrant issued and when you get there you have to Redo all the paperwork. Why this? Lindsay Lohan always an hour late for court. This cute. You know Michael Jackson showed up in pajamas an our late for court as well, and they try to be strict like Michael, you know, you're 46 minutes late for court. Come with this fucking fact, Cuban to court late one time and see what happens after a half hour there. Strategies to it. Let's pretend you got a parking ticket, a speeding ticket, and you know the cop a lot of times is the best strategy that my attorney in Jersey would do.

Speaker 7:          02:40:17       He would always say, tell the copy I show up and then he would call and go Rogan's running late, but he would tell the court clerks or we'll never get to the judge so the judge would issue a bench warrant fleet and we wait for the cop to leave the building. Then we sneak around the back and we just say, you got caught in traffic. They Redo your bench warrant. There's no to testify in a speeding ticket. And they dropped the charges with the ticket. That's old school. That's uncle Joe. He dropping knowledge on a motherfucker right there, but there's other situations where you don't want to be late for court, especially if you go for Rehab or Michael Jackson molest butting heads. That's why right now that that tells you right there. I've been to court before. I day even bolder, the nicest people in the world. Get the court 10 minutes late. They'll even let you in the fucking door. Once they close that door in boulder, sorry, go to the third floor. That means they handcuff you and go through the whole fucking thing all over again.

Speaker 3:          02:41:06       It's like the idea that you can come to a place and this is the place to go. If you want to get famous, this is the place and the whole like entertainment industry, so this is like the main hub of it. You're going to get a lot of cool people to look cool. People that we know that all live here. Look at how many friends we have that all live here. You've got a lot of God damn cool people till you get people that have gotten through the whole thing and sort of figured it out and relaxed and settled in and then you know, became a. understood how to, how to, how to work within the parameters of the business without getting caught up in it and becoming one of those weird last Hollywood type people.

Speaker 7:          02:41:47       This is my beef and I think it's true of before, so two and a red band doesn't look at it this way and this and I've always thought about because I'm 50, but uh, I go for auditions, which you don't, and I see a little bit more of this bullshit and I once saw girls, maybe six years old that were adorable. I walked into a room this big that was packed, but these two little girls that was six decide that they're going to take 20 of the head shots and put them all over the floor. Okay. And I heard the one girl say some tailored girls. You got to move this one little girl said my daddy's a director or something like that. Okay. So this is my problem guys. Me, I'm a piece of shit. I'll live anywhere. Really want to raise a child here, you know? Uh, I don't want. This is probably the values of life here are judged differently than what they are in Chicago, Boston. And you might look down on that. Some people might look down on that, but I don't, I never don't. I don't know. I think for us there's like, first of all,

Speaker 3:          02:42:54       this is the only place where there's like such a conglomeration of those people, so it's like if you live your whole life and you never come in contact with them, you know, this is, it can be kind of shocking when you're around like a bunch of actors are a bunch of Hollywood types, but the one of the real problem is there's not any other that's looked at like that prominently here. That's so overwhelming. There's so many people that are involved in it that kids like automatically sort of gravitate towards it. They like everybody wants to be famous, they'll gravitate towards it. Whereas in Denver, who the fuck is going to be famous? So you want to be famous. That's a real God damn pipe dream. If you live in Boston, you know it's a real God damn pipe dream. But if you live in Hollywood, it seems like it's attainable. Oh my God. We saw this guy at the mall and then we were there. We saw this and we went to an audition and I saw Ben Affleck. Oh, you know, just becomes, it comes more of a focal point and there's not enough other shit here.

Speaker 4:          02:43:43       Let me ask you something. How come? Have you ever seen any pictures of Joe Rogan hate dude, never. I'll tell you later. Oh No, no, no. I'm just saying why? Because Joe does pop razzi pages. Well suddenly that I don't do all that shit. No, I understand. I don't like to go to parties. No, no, no. I'm just saying even anywhere you listen. If you go to Laurel Canyon, farmer's market with your family now on Sunday varieties, that 10, 15. Yeah. Okay. I'm calling you right now because I've seen him. I encountered a bunch of New York. I'm not A. I'm not saying nothing bad about pop rocks. He's like, I'm just making a point. If you want people taking pictures, you people take motherfucking busy. If you don't want to, you don't want that. People will not bother you. Don't bother you. People don't bother Adam Carolla the people that are in the, in the, in the limelight want to be in the land. Well, there's a lot of folks that do things on purpose for sure. Just the other night that was.

Speaker 5:          02:44:36       I was talking to my friend the other day who, he's a popper I'd see, and he's like, uh, you want to go to the lax tonight? I'm like, why are you guys well here? I got Lindsay Logan's boarding pass. She's flying in at 5:30 AM.

Speaker 4:          02:44:47       I'm like, what? Oh fuck. I've watched the other day or read it. I read it online about Jamie Presley. Did you guys read that story about her getting into a beef in Hollywood? Because the chick stole. This is hysterical. So her assistant, somebody stole her assistance purse, right? The jewelry you heard about? No, she went to Hollywood to get the assistance purse back. But the girl that had something in the purse that lets you know that the pro, you like a gps. The GPS on the phone was in the purse and they figured out it was pointed to this bar where they're having the celebrity stuff out. So Jamie Presley showed up and yelled at the girl, but then it turned out that in that purse with drugs, I don't know. So the cops showed up and then nobody knows who the person was. Like once they got there, like, no, that ain't my bro. You guys were just. They got into a fight over the fucking purse. But once the cops got there, they opened. The person was like blow and steroids in. There is some shit like that. Ain't no motherfucking person no more. Ain't no fuck. We don't even know what.

Speaker 4:          02:45:50       It's always a pleasure, my friend. Do you remember this?

Speaker 5:          02:45:55       You're mad TV on the Sopranos.

Speaker 4:          02:45:58       She told me every fucking show. It's

Speaker 3:          02:46:02       funny. You just pull it up. I saw James Gandolfini walking around in New York. How big is he? A big guy. Big Guy. I saw him in that movie. Them softly. It's actually pretty fucking good movie man. Isn't a good movie. That's pretty fucking good movie. I knew anything Brad Pitt, but to other solid. They killed that. Fuck that. I don't know why they killed it. I enjoy that movie. It was a good movie. It was one of those under the radar. Brad Pitt's a bad motherfucker. Kendall feeney is a killer. He's a killer. I don't know if he's know what happens in this country every day at 5:00 now what happens at 5:00, they started the sopranos from scratch at Hbo. They brought them back because it was just too overwhelming. Hbo took them back from a and e and they said it's all going to play him every day and there are doing season one watching them my and there was torture. Torturous, but not all the swears and all the bad shit. That Wasi episode, the third episode of season, when they take the power back, when Jackie dies, they go down. That is one of the best written show of off and gather. The feeney was very. I forgot how good he really was. Everybody else was sub par. He was, he's amazing. He fucking, he plays a total psycho and it's killing them softly and it's so fucking unbelievable. It's so believable. Oh, that's great.

Speaker 8:          02:47:15       They seen a period for that guy that did district nine, his next movie with Matt Damon in it.

Speaker 3:          02:47:19       Um, no,

Speaker 8:          02:47:21       it's fucking amazing. Uh, you remember the name was it? Yeah, but it's takes place like 100 years in the future in the trailer is so bad ass. It looks amazing.

Speaker 3:          02:47:34       Well, um, I was in New York this past weekend for the upfronts, for Scifi, for this new show that I'm doing that I can now talk about that I don't get in trouble called Joe Rogan questions, everything. But they got this new show called defiance that's coming out. That's a combination video game and science fiction show. Dude, it looks insane. It's this, it's a huge, huge, huge project that the Scifi channel is an undertaking. And the SCIFI channel, we're battlestar Galactica came from I think so. Was that the, did they do Battlestar Galactica? Battlestar Galactica was one of my favorite fucking shows ever that, that remake Battlestar Galactica. It took till season two for Brian to convince me that I should check it out. It's fucking tremendous. Twice, like 54. What is it?

Speaker 8:          02:48:18       This is that new movie. It's caught and it has matt Damon in it. And just look at that though. Look at that right there. That's fucking beautiful.

Speaker 10:         02:48:36       like it's supposed to be a 21, 54, I think like really long in the future. And it's like Matt Damon's all buffing it and said, oh, for my. But if it's just like district nine, oh my God, look sick. I know. When is this coming out?
