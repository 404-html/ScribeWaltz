Speaker 2:          00:00:49       [inaudible] Horace.

Speaker 1:          00:00:55       When I hear that music, I don't win. That's how it starts. But smile on my face. Wild Times. I could live in a wild times. Let's get on our horses and just ride. I guess what I want to say once Dan a pro and I could survive not talking to anybody. Damn right. All I need is a match, a Bowie knife. And my Dick. So he's that character that Charles Bronson dude who wants to live in the woods by himself and doesn't bother anybody with the government, has to go out there and fuck with them and he winds up killing everybody. What is it that we might admire about that guy who doesn't need the American way? Self sufficiency? Man, I don't need anybody but myself. I'm self-reliant. Yeah, but you know with a lot of guys like the, the, the, the loner would be kind of creepy, but Charles Bronson had a way of pulling it off that was admirable.

Speaker 1:          00:01:35       Sure will do is nothing Ted Kaczynski about him. Charles Bronson was a bad ass and God help you if you were a fan and tried to come out to him. I Ms. Guy. I Know Adam West Batman told me a story 16 years ago about how Charles Bronson was reading a book in a bookstore and this guy comes in and goes, excuse me, Mr Bryson, I'm a huge fan and Charles Monster goes fuck off. And it goes right back to his place. Just like that guy was like, oh, okay. It's hard to know how much of that is the truth. He was notorious full of shit. He was notorious for being, uh, just not the friend that he was a tough, he was a real tough guy actually. You know, when he did hard times, if you'd never seen hard times. Youngsters, youngsters, please. It's one of the Goddamn all time classics.

Speaker 1:          00:02:17       It's a beautiful movie and it's a, it's really like, uh, the first like underground cage fighting movie. They actually fun in a cage. Yup. Bronson was in his fifties when he shot. Was He in his 50s? Because you see his body, it's ridiculous. You get a lot of native American in him and I think he used to be like an acrobat or something, something along those lines. A circus I think. Hey, we would with with Wikipedia were just bullshit through this. He was in the circus. Yeah. Yes. In the circus. He did couple in Brazil. In Brazil. He did couple. It's always my favorite stuff when people go, no, this guy, I know this guy. He wasn't, it wasn't UFC dude. He fought in the underground in Burma. He has a confirmed

Speaker 3:          00:03:00       kills belt. There was a lot of guys who just made up a bunch of shit like that in the 70s and the, remember the the guy who they did the movie kickbox well not kickboxing bloods bloodsport yeah, frank ducks. Yeah. Yeah. He's a Ninjitsu guy. Went out there, there's a coma tain just fucked everybody up. Supposedly he had a story number Dimock which was death touch. There was a guy named Raphael Toria and I've talked about this guy before because this guy snuck through my crazy radar and I realized that he was, there was something wrong and then it turned out he was a killer. Like I didn't know I was around this guy. He was a friend of a friend who was a friend of Eddie's and I was around this guy a couple of times and normally my crazy radars are really good, but this guy snuck right through it and he was such a pathological liar.

Speaker 3:          00:03:45       This is one of the things that he did. He was a fake black belt who, one of the things he did was he had a friend drive him to this spot and he said, I'm going into the woods. You can't come any further. I'm going to go to this [inaudible] and I'll be back in two days. So his friends drives them into the woods and then he sees him like walk around and like hide behind a tree and he flipped the fuck is he doing right? So he kind of hangs back to watch and the dude starts walking back down the road where he came from like, so the guy drives off, right? Because like, I dunno what the fuck is. His deal was, but he wanted to be dropped off in the woods. He, the guy comes back two days later with a trophy. I kind of like, he comes out of the woods.

Speaker 3:          00:04:25       Well, he has a story about, well, I had a fight, 50 men all bare knuckle. Some guys chose to have glass on their hand. Some guys not just had just crazy nutty. Meanwhile, feigning while his prompts finding stories. Guy Fuck fest, I got to put this handkerchief in my pants. Don't worry about it. It's just a signal. It was nothing. There was no, nothing happened. He made up the whole thing. There was no Kuma Tej out there and he just came off. He just went, yeah, it's same thing. I had the guy in a headlock that I fucked him while he wound up killing a guy by choking him to death. Oh really? Yeah. That's the stories that this guy, he was just as crazy pathological liar and he wound up hooking up with this girl and the girl was married and he choked her husband to death.

Speaker 3:          00:05:06       Oh Nice guy. In real life when you choke somebody to death and stiff, like just choking him like Jujitsu style, you have to like continue the choke on when they're already passed out. Just hold it. Cause like in the movies it's like Ah. And then they pass out and they're like, ah, he's dead. You know. But in real life, some people would die from it and glorious bastards. When he choked her with his hands. That's really hard to do. Really hard to do. Even put a guy out by choking him was, you know, it hurts, but it's all a matter of how much you can tolerate. You know, it's the, it's cuts your breathing off cause it's crushes your windpipe. If the guy's got good thumbs, but it probably won't put you unconscious tars tars so you can do it. It's not something I practice, but some guys will tap to that like, like it kickboxers when we first started fighting and MMA, they tapped to like forearms across the neck.

Speaker 3:          00:05:52       Like a guy will just stack, I'm going to get a form on their neck and they just can't deal with it. I don't know how to react to it. Yeah, I've seen it a few times. Like high level kickbox just like Tom Erickson, I think Tom Erickson did actually tap a guy with a rape joke. He actually grabbed his neck like this. Wow. What we would call the rape choke. Wow. Yeah. And he tapped the guy in humanly strong hands. So Tom Erickson was 300 pounds. That American wrestler gorilla, you're going to tap. There's one point in time when Tom Erickson was the scariest guy in the planet and he kind of missed both boats as far as like fame and a lot of people don't know about Erickson because of that. But if you go back to like when Erickson fought, fought Kevin random and it smashed him and knocked him unconscious, he was fucking like really close to 300 pounds corn fed because one of those big crazy white boys just in a powerful wrestler. Just a real good rest. I'd love to have a rape joke strength with other guys. Just grab a guy, go, you're going out with Ericsson. We got, he was getting famous right at the time where the UFC was falling apart and so he went to fight over in Japan and he just never really, it just his, the peak of his athletic talent and the peak of his, his uh, possibilities. They didn't collide together correctly.

Speaker 4:          00:07:01       Thanks. I was thinking about it, it's like just for MMA, like if you're a tennis players, have MMA seems to be to stay on top, but what the way say Anderson Silva or GSP has is so extraordinarily difficult because there are so many good guys now coming up and more importantly it looks to me like a lot of these guys are really learning how to box cause they're coming out of boxing gyms. When you learn how to box and you can punch now instead of like punching like a wrestler, they're punching like boxers. When you don't have gloves, you make one mistake. You're going to sleep

Speaker 3:          00:07:29       guy Fabio Maldonado that's been fighting out of Brazil and he just fought recently and this fucking kid is, he's got nasty hands dude and eat for Kyle Kingsbury who's like a serious athlete, two Oh five and Kyle Kingsborough was grabbing in the Meu Thai clinch and he was just ripping hooks to his body and Kingsbury had to let it go, which is rare. Most of the times when a guy gets you into noise and I clench and he punches body, that guys can take it. But he turns his punches over so good and he's so loose with them. They just buy it by him. Like there, there were just vicious body punches. You see the difference between a guy who could really punch. Like if you got a guy like Manny Pacquiao and you gave him those little gloves getting, let me tell you something, man. If you don't take Manny Pacquiao down the first five 10 seconds, that fight back of Ricky Hatton headwind and what that Hook, oh, I thought he was dead too.

Speaker 3:          00:08:19       I've never been like, oh my God, he got shut off. The thing about Pacbio is he's a little guy. He's only 140 750 pounds, but he hits fucking hard for a little guy. Dude, I've, I've watched him physically hit the pants. Freddie Roach was holding pads for him. I watched it and dude, first of all, the punches come so fast and all of them are hard. It's not so like maybe like there's a guy who could punch 40% harder than, but he might only hit you once. Pat Cow's going to hit you 18 fucking that time. I think a lot of guys can't train for that kind of speed. You can get your sparring partners, you can't like when I watched what he did to Margarito who

Speaker 1:          00:08:56       is a bigger guy and has been towards and has actually never been hurt. Margarita is a rough, when he got hurt by Mosley before that, but he still psychologically fuck cause they caught him with a plaster and his gloves and we made them fight anyway. That's crazy shit. He knew he was going to be suspended and he's going to be such an assassin and to see Manny pat can take a bigger man like that and do whatever. He was a monster. Packy I was one of the, if not the greatest of all time, top two. I mean I think, I think I would think he's number one just to, and people will argue with it, but God dammit, he's won world titles in eight different weight classes. Who the fuck has every done that? I would love to have seen him fight. Um, Duran. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:09:38       Oh my God. Oh my God. Duran at one 47 the Duran, that beach sugar ray. And the first fine crazy and that really wasn't as best weight class. Darren's best way class. It was one 35 one 35 was one of the greatest lightweight of all time. If you watch like it's fight with Ken Buchanan when he won the title, he was fucking vicious. Panama's street kid. Unbelievable. Just the animal man was a born fighter. You see what these documentaries on that guy and it's like a pit bull. It's like a gain bred dog, like a guy to interview him space. Then when to interview him in Panama when he was a kid, when he was a contender, when he was coming up and they're following them in the streets, asking them about boxing. Where'd you learn at a box and in front of these reporters, he grabs a cat by the tail and throws it into a brick wall.

Speaker 1:          00:10:16       Oh my God. Yeah, in front of them. You know, he, I remember when they, there was an old interview and you could probably youtube it where he's being asked by like Brent Musburger, someone about his fight with Macho Hector Macho Comacho he hits some fight with you. No, it was later on in his career. And, and you'd hear him say some stuff and like Spanish, but I didn't know that was one of them might have corn and, and uh, well I uh, then there's the interpreter say, um, cause it, cause Brenmar hospital. What do you feel that you're, you're fighting an outside, it's going to be hot. Is the heat going to affect you or do you think you're used to that? You know, uh, against someone like macho who moves around so much in a ring light, he goes, hey, just go ahead and just put it on.

Speaker 1:          00:10:52       And medical. Then, uh, he's referring to, uh, Mr. Camacho is a homosexual and so, so much. Yeah. So Martin [inaudible], I'd be like, well yeah, but don't you think that you're fighting now with 10 ounce glass wasn't 12 ounce gloves now and you, you are a harder hit her. I'm a lot of people saying, do you think that's going to favor unified? You going to go to the body, you think more than the chin, Mitochondria, tenor. And he's still a referring to Mr. Watson. I'm a sexual and, and if I think it the third time I'm, or whoever it was, Ms. Berger and he's like, uh, he's, he's still calling him a homosexual man. That's a Roberto Duran. I guess we're not going to get anything out of him. You know, he was impossible man. He was just like, dude, I think fighter. Well it also, you mean he grew up in Panama? Man, I think if you grow up in a tough country, you know, you grow up in a spotlight that you grew up poor Noriega and they say Noriega and he were friends. Like Noriega liked him a lot. Like when they have more on everybody, Roberto Duran, you can't not love a true fighter. He's a true fighter representing your country. They had other guys you say be a Pedroza wasn't here from Panama as well. I think he was

Speaker 3:          00:11:54       Cuba. I don't really know. I don't remember. I thought he was from Panama but, but Duran was one of my favorite fighters of all time and the guy couldn't even speak English. It didn't matter. He just was such a savage. She's going to be interesting to see like guys like Nick Diaz are coming out of Andre Ward's camp and stuff and these guys who are really studying boxing and even though it it, you have to know everything and they may wish to. What I love about it [inaudible] you are going to get some guys who are going to become, you know, incredible boxers and the, I think that the, it's going to be an issue about you're going to have fights that last that, that are not, you can't have very good punchers you can't slip when you don't have gloves. When guys can punch that hard. I think it's going to, something's going to have to give them that.

Speaker 3:          00:12:34       You guys are going to get mine as many mistakes. Yeah. I mean Cain Valasquez is great, right? We know how great he is now. He has to fight jr Santos and Santos can hit. So somebody's going to catch somebody in that fight and it doesn't necessarily mean it's the better fighter. It might mean that you just got caught or your game plan was a little too hasty. You gotta be very careful. You saw the check Congo Pat Barry fight. Yes I did. Which is the craziest NZ in any fight ever. I mean, that's a perfect example of why you have to be so careful in MMA. It's unbelief. And Pat Barry is explosive. Oh my God. And he went after a man, he decided that he was getting criticized for his fights and he was kind of boring. And people were saying, he doesn't, you know, take enough chances.

Speaker 3:          00:13:11       Well, he showed why he doesn't take enough chances because look, when you take chances, you can get knocked the fuck out. And he was a fun, it was a fight. He was winning easily. If he just fought at a discipline pace, that probably would have never happened. And that's experience. Yes. Experience. But it's also, he chose to fight in an exciting style on purpose. He wanted to throw caution to the wind and just go, you know, kill or die, kill or be killed. And I think he, uh, he did that. He did exactly what he wanted to do, but some guys never do that. And by the way, Shit, Congo, taking those shots. God Damn. I've never seen a body like that. It's the most ridiculous thing. So Superhero former here. Yeah, he's a superhero. He's a, he's a extreme mesomorph that's what that guy is.

Speaker 3:          00:13:52       He's good. He's just super muscular, like perfect athletic frame. You know, he's not the best heavyweight athlete though, which is weird. I mean it, Cain Velasquez is a way better heavyweight athlete, which is weird cause if you saw the two of them together, I mean the average person looks at check Congo and Cain Velasquez and you'll get the fuck out of here. That black guy's going to kill him. That's isn't that, that's like wrestling. Like you know, you gotta you gotta like you roll in Jujitsu and some guy comes in and he's got this beautiful body and somebody he can, you can move and manipulate and then a guy shows up and he looks like a plumber with a bit of a belly and he's just like immovable. He's, yeah, I think it's how your body is balanced. That Congo is always dangerous to anybody because he's got some pop in those hands.

Speaker 3:          00:14:29       Dude, he was the only guy to really saw hurt her. ASCA is too, he's tough as shit. He went three full rounds with Cain and Cain beat the fuck out of him in that fight. You know he's, he's obviously durable cause Congo caught him with some big punches. Mere put them to sleep, but mere got him in a guillotine. Mirrors. Ganti it's nasty. He and he did it so perfect. If you watched the way he locked it up, he's cinches it up. He blocks off the neck with his arm and squeeze squeezing with his right. It's like it was, yeah. Mirror is one of those guys, man, if he catches you, especially in the early part of the fight where he's not even a little bit tired and you give up an arm or or, or a choke or something like that and he's going to break your neck, man, you're off.

Speaker 3:          00:15:06       I can't wait to see my boy, man Miller, who is my become a good friend. I just love that guy. I want to see him fight Michael Bisping. It's going to be great, man. I just love watching him. I love his whole attitude. I love it. He never stops moving. I will never stop moving. I wish that people could see what what he did. But I was in Vegas and we were laughing and talking and he kept moving around and we're joking around. And then finally he got so excited, he w he walked out in the hallway anyway, nobody was watching. He'd just kind of punched the air and ran down the hallway for no reason. I was like, he just spazzed out in the hallway and got so excited and he came back in there. Well, he knows he's got some extra energy. He's got to get rid of it. Smart Guy, by the way. He's supposed to be doing what he's doing.

Speaker 5:          00:15:43       You know what's crazy is you can look at him and see like that guy. Like, I'm not going to fight that guy. That guy's scary. But like last night, uh, Jake was in the audience at one of your shows. Oh, what's his name? Jake, right. Jake Ellenberger. Yeah. Yeah. And he sat in my seat and I'm like, who's this guy sitting in my seat? And I'm walking up and I like look at his ears. I'm like, I'm Outta here.

Speaker 3:          00:16:03       Jake. Jake was there when I was, Jake was there with, he came to my show in Vegas with a, with mayhem and yeah, he's just got a fire hydrant on his shoulders. He took like clay and they chip. They were a bad scope or they chipped out like you know his head. Nah, this is good enough. That dude's a tank and he's a scary as fuck. He's going to fight Jake shields. That's going to be a very interesting, he's very good. He's a very good striker and she is prescribed, oh, he's a lot better stroke then shields. But shields has got some wicked takedowns and some of his top Jujitsu. Lucky if he gets on top of you. Ooh, you're fucked. Jake shields is one of the best in the world at, at finishing guys in MMA and Jujitsu. Jujitsu is like real simple. Like he's always used Nogi.

Speaker 3:          00:16:48       He's not not a gay guy. So he doesn't have any key habits at all. And he like, if he gets on top of you, he's a wrestler. So he's got awesome positioning control and he's strong as fuck and he'll squeeze off arm triangles on you all day if he catches you. If Jake shields gets on top of you and he gets you in a bad position, you're fucked man. Cause it's like a level, it's a really high, high level of Jujitsu that that guy breaks. If he gets you in a checkmate position, the odds are that you're going to squirm out of it. Like look, he got Paul Daley and elite Xc and elite XC. They were fucking him by the fight goes to the ground for more than 15 seconds. They stand you up, like literally told the referee. So stand fights up. Even if they're active. Like Roy Nelson got stood up when he was in fucking side control working on a Kamora and Andre Arlovski and they stood him up. It was completely ridiculous. Well Jake Shields Jujitsu was so tight. He caught Paul daily with an arm bar. Even under those rules, he doesn't need much time. Dude. He gets a guy like daily on the ground. It's like, give me that pitch crazy. He's just, it's just that high level stuff, but he's got to get it to the ground. That's where Ellenberger

Speaker 1:          00:17:50       you can, if you can defend a take down, that's a huge part of it. Ellenberger moves good on his feet too. That's the other thing. He's not a duty. Just stands there like a robot. Like there's some guys who just kind of weighed in. He moves, he moves on. It's feet and lose on is tough. That's a tough fight. That's an excellent fight. What's your calling the Biz Bang Miller fight. Fucking I want, can't wait to see the series because the series is going to be hilarious cause mayhem is never going to stop fucking with them and I've already heard some shit that's gone down. I can't divulge any information to give you any previews, but there's already been some crazy shit going down and mayhem is having a blast. He's a true hands. Like I'm around comics all the time. That dude's hilarious. Yeah, I mean he's a true personality.

Speaker 1:          00:18:30       He's, he's got bigger than life personality. He's so entertaining. Like, I love hanging out with the guy because he's just, it's just always fun. He just want to get some insight into him. Read his articles. He's smart. Yeah. He's a good writer, man. He's a good writer. No doubt. He's a really smart guy. He's not, you know, you think, are you looking at him? He's got dyed hair. He's like, yeah, smart. Very smart. He's got a great take on things and a very thought out take on things and if you read his blogs like he works, he's very proud of them. He's a very good writer and he could fucking easily write a book and it would be a great book because he said there's a guy who's lived some crazy shit. My buddy and my buddy Anthony Tampax was a novelist who actually, it was talking to him about his novel.

Speaker 1:          00:19:09       He would, he said, you should write a book, and I think, I think he's going to call it total mayhem or something like that. This is great. Yeah. Why not just tell his story, man. These fucking stories of getting in fights with his dad and she's growing up, getting in fights on his blog. I said, the first time I met him, I were in Vegas and I walked in and I said, dude, you know, I've got to just be honest in a tee shirt. You don't look that tough. I, you know, he, I mean besides the nose and the ears, but you look at his back and he's a big oven. It's Kinda lanky. I mean, if you, if he said, I'm a, I'm a tennis pro, I'd be like, that makes sense. You're a tennis pro. You're not, he doesn't look like an MMA fight. It's not like, uh, like, like Jake, you look in his ears and his neck. You're like, wow. But may him from behind

Speaker 4:          00:19:42       somewhat slender gig conversation. Yeah, exactly. This is how it's done. I am, I've been listening to you guys like as if you guys were all gay guys, like talking about other guys so much louder than the steam and the steam of the shower. What I'm trying to say is that he tends to just the way the water rivulets his body was holding me down. I came here and leave your butt fucking is so weird. Can't believe you've got that kind of top game. Just don't smile at me cause then it makes it really gay for the last five minutes. I've been thinking about that and you're like, you know, like you said beautiful body. You said you should see his, if he gets a hold of you on top, you know, you're like, you just replay the whole thing. What you're saying and act like you were talking about other gay guys like Gossiping. It's one of the funniest things though. So a psychiatrist have a field day. First of all, you know, it also charges to have a field day. Talking about Jujitsu, it's two guys. Two guys in their forties yeah. Two guys in their forties passion. I'm talking about fighting. One guy has a very, very manly beer. The other one is shaved his off and he's got a backwards baseball hat and he's pushing 50 cut to us an hour one. No shirts, no shirts. I'm hot, not going to wear these pants.

Speaker 1:          00:20:48       I got this new lotion I'm using. If it's the right choice. Let me see. How does it feel like flowers go man. You feel as slippery as a sly. Finally found the steep rate of listening to MMA talk. Now I will not have eyes glazed over anymore. I'll be giggling like a mother fucker attendance. Talking about gay sex cuts me wearing a Bandanna for no reason. A lot of people don't still don't know that Brian was the one. I had a thing called getting pumped that a Howard stern used to play a bunch of times. It was on my first CD. I'm going to be dead someday and it's me and this other dude working out in the basement and it's me and Brian and uh, it was fuck that was to that. I'm Kelly, Kirsten and Kelly Curtis and played my mom. I remember when we lay that down.

Speaker 1:          00:21:27       Yeah, that was fun, Dude. That was very fun. Anyway, if you ever meet may him asking him to tell you the story about when he was in Florida and he ended up in Jane, like six guys. He was dancing with a girl and guys like you trying to disrespect me. He was like, Nah, I'm not disrespecting Dan. Dan A guy's eye. He throws a punch and my based on goes with an elbow knocks man. I gotta get Outta here. He goes out there and like six guys come on. He's like, Oh, here goes, they had no idea what they were getting into. It's like I was just like a bunch of, you know, coyotes coming in on a pit bull or something and like, oh, it's gotta be like, knock you out dad. I, there was a bot pile of bodies around him. Wow. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:22:04       I mean, you want to fight him. You're not a pro. Just throwing a couple punches in your life. It took some karate in high school. Go have fun, have fun with me and Miller. Well, this what people don't understand. The difference between a professional fighter on a regular human being is this is something that doing every day, all day for hours. And Man doesn't take time off. He doesn't get fat if mayhem doesn't have a fight going on, he's still training. He's still doing, Jujitsu is still doing his boxing. He's still doing everything. [inaudible] it was literally like trying to have an argument with a guy and all you have is a book on the language and he's fluent in it. [inaudible] just going to tell you what not. That's exactly what it is. But it's like, it's like fighting is like a language, you know, and everybody there you go to Fulcan homemaker, bro.

Speaker 1:          00:22:40       And he told you something, you don't really actually like coming because he's going to kick your knees out from you and get along. Just don't laugh and then you're gonna realize he doesn't get tired because he's fucking doing it for six hours a day. I remember getting drunk with Eve Edwards and, and, and, and, and Nate Marquardt. We were, we were in a, we were shooting this, um, this, uh, movie in Pittsburgh and he started just, this is warrior, right? This comes out in September and, uh, and it's been testing through the roof. This is what you play me, I play you. I remember I called you and I said, I'm playing you in a movie. I called you. I go, I'm planning in a movie. Can you give me some advice? He goes, I just tried to take myself completely out of the equation and that really helped. I just would call the fights, but they wrote some funny stuff from me. I'm a, I'm a smart ass, you know, in the movie. Nice. Nice. But I'm a rolling, what's your name in the movie, Brian? It really, well, I don't know why more actors just don't do the way I got the parts. I put the, I put the writer and the director together. Imagine that Tom Hanks as stars, as Tom Hanks do that Danny Devito is Danny Devito. A short twin of Arnold Schwartzenegger

Speaker 3:          00:23:46       played by Arnold Swartz. And do you think Swardson nigger is ever going to bounce back? Do you think anybody will ever take you guys seriously?

Speaker 4:          00:23:56       I don't think so. Mainly because it depends on how he reacts to it, but if you're older now, first of all, nobody wants to see him as an action hero. Number two, you know, look, I understand infidelity. I can understand as a man, you f you may stray. Let's all be respectful. Let's all be forgiving, et Cetera. Okay, I've net, not that I've ever had thoughts like that, but the point is that if you're going to fund the housekeeper, here's it. Just first of all, that's outrageous, but let shit, I'll give it to you. I don't know. Maybe she had big tests. She was off you and she smelled like something. You were born. I get it. You're the king of the world. How about pulling up or we're in a condom? I don't know. How about not giving her a baby?

Speaker 3:          00:24:32       Think the whole thing is the wild thing. The whole thing of doing it is you're not even supposed to be doing this and she's soaking your raw car. Can you just look at that fucking housekeeper pussies? This is my house. I fucking everybody in my house. I just think about it. And you did. Should I pull out Gonan doesn't bluff. It's shoot a load in the were like Kona and shit. Easy. When you're, when, when you're the king of the world, why not? He's the king of his world, man. The guy's living in this $20 million mansion. Apparently right after this happened, they put the house up for sale and it wasn't, he didn't know it. He sold it to someone else. But this is the house where all the affairs took place and he sold it to like some professional golfer or something like that.

Speaker 3:          00:25:15       And that guy put it up right away and he might've put it up right away because people started hassling him extension drive through and fidelity, this is echoing in the walls, like a mass murderer building. That building's haunted with him coming, uh, coming all the time, calming. Uh, and he fucked her for 10 years, man. He did. He was fucking her for 10. You were so excited. Oh, I thought, oh no, no, no. God, no, no. He was, he was banging her in the bed. He was how raised tagging her in the bathroom. He was banging her every, once you think of it as a tool for masturbation type thing, like she was just like a fleshlight. Amen. What are you talking about dude? That's a human being. Yeah, but it's also her, his main kind of things.

Speaker 4:          00:26:09       He has a face. It looks a little bit like mayhem millers and I'm not attracted to that, but uh, I guess he is. She was a big I, who knows what she looked like when she was young.

Speaker 3:          00:26:18       I think he could make a comeback if he doesn't maybe like cop land and whenever you're ready. What she looks like. I don't mean to make fun of the Mexican female version of Krs one. Listen, she has a daughter. That's all. She's a pretty lady. That's what I'm saying. I'm a big scare. One Fan. That's it sounded the police look good for her man, but she, she was doing what she was. No woman can say no to our scores girl that told me. Huh? Do you ever see

Speaker 5:          00:26:43       cop land now? Like that was kind of a weird movie for Sylvester Stallone where it was kind of like you played a little chubby fat. Yeah. I think if he, if Arnold does a movie like that where he plays a character that's like kind of like down on his luck coming back, you know, kind of like a dirty cop

Speaker 1:          00:26:57       or something like that. I want to see a good actor do that. I don't know how good an actor he, is it true? Don't go to the movies to see dramatic gut, but you also thought that it festers Stallone when he no, no, no, no, because semesters told him. Did Rocky. Yeah. Okay. You got to remember he did some shitty ass Middle East, but Sylvester Stallone did fucking rocky road and it's one of the best movies hung in there because they wanted to give that movie to someone else. They wanted to give that movie to some other stars and he said, no, this is my movie. And when he wrote this and did this, and in the end of the movie, he doesn't even when, that's what a lot of people don't even realize he loses in that movie. It was inspired by a losing performance by Chuck Wepner, with Chuck Wepner Flop Muhammad Ali.

Speaker 1:          00:27:38       So he wrote all this shit out. It did it all himself and acting, it's fucking asshole. He became a goof kind of later. And I love him. I mean, when I say a Goof, I'm saying a guy who does these big crazy cartoonish movies and forget how great those moments where when you were a young man and I saw first blood. Yeah. That's one of the best movies I've ever seen. I loved it. It was great for who you were at the time. And at the time it came out, you know, and being 14 or whatever, but rocky still a bad ass fucking

Speaker 5:          00:28:05       yeah, but I mean if you take away the fighting, I haven't seen rocky maybe 10 years. No, I know, but is the acting actually good? It's a Talia Shire. Brilliant man. Squashed

Speaker 1:          00:28:14       it three days ago and, and uh, I'll tell you something right now. That movie holds the test of time. It is, it is still a lot of great movies and one of the most moving movies when, when he's down, he's gonna stay down rock. I remember Burgess Meredith when he comes, that actor who call and he says, I want to be a manager rock. I'm 76 years old. I want to be a man. It stinks. You know what my place, and he does that whole thing. Then it comes running out and puts them. It was such a beautiful, it's brilliant. It was, it was the great one of the greatest character pieces ever written in my opinion, to when he's angry and he's like, this is all he's got in his house and in birds around there. And he's in and he's yelling and screaming. That was so fucking real.

Speaker 1:          00:28:53       And then he was so moving when he looks at Adrian and he goes, I remember when I said that stuff they said about me on TV. Didn't hurt and he walks away if your heartbreaks for man. Yeah. It's like when he gets his shit together and got up and starts drinking raw eggs, you're fucking, you start moving your seat and you got goose bumps. A lot of people credit, a lot of dual credit. That movie for, for our sharing in the fitness craze in America. Shortly I was whatever I was and when it came out 11 or something like that, I drank raw eggs and ran around my block. Damn threw up. I just don't remember the dude. He was a bad motherfucker. And it's, it's a weird thing. It's like, wow, how does a guy, I guess he just gives up on good movies and says, let's just merge something queries and explode. I always have a good time. But yeah, that might be a bit, I think what happens is like with Arnold, anybody, uh, you

Speaker 4:          00:29:41       know, when you've been, when you surround yourself, it's almost impossible to avoid when you surround yourself with, with a army of people that make their living off you. What happens I think is that like anything at politician has been empowered. Too Long. You start, you lose self awareness because everybody's telling you you're perfect, you're great. They laugh at your jokes and everything. You're the emperor. And I think that it, the, the biggest trapping of that kind of fame is that you start to drink the Koolaid and you lose perspective. You lose self awareness. You, you, you keep playing the same note over and over again because people keep telling you it's great. And instead of like actually putting yourself back in the real arena, which is competing with what's really going on and having people really give you real critiques, uh, you know, I was in an acting class and Burt Reynolds showed up and he did some scenes in class and I thought to myself, Burt Reynolds at 70, whatever it is, still not only doing scenes in class, but kind of failing in front of people and having a teacher critique his performance.

Speaker 3:          00:30:40       And was he getting a lot of white pussy because of this young white? I didn't see that, but that's probably why anybody would be in an acting class. By the way, it's Burt Reynolds from boogie nights. So good. And so

Speaker 4:          00:30:52       areas, you know, he did a scene from carnal knowledge with uh, uh, uh, Catherine Bell from uh, anyway, but um,

Speaker 3:          00:30:59       well he's another guy, right? Go back to deliverance. Burt Reynolds was a bad motherfuckers. He was, he was a bad motherfucker. And then he got pain and then he got weird. Why you start? You start wearing a wig and you get plastic surgery. I don't think still though, Dude. Those fucking, there's something about him and those smokey and the bandit movies where you really wanted him to succeed. He was a great movie star. He is a good looking guy who is always happy. They always had a smile on his face. He had a silly mustache and he was always getting the girl and you wanted them to as a fucking, wanted him to get away from the law. And by the way, he weighed off and mustache work. Fucking rock that. I grew up mustache. I do this thing for a Californication. I had a mustache.

Speaker 3:          00:31:40       I looked like I should work in a deli. That's a sexy. As I get, like I should be making sandwiches. He looks like a fucking, you know, a leading man. I looked like an ape. Very hard to piss a mustache. Go. I go human. This is what I got human here. And then I go to AP and then I shave it down. The human when I went with a mustache wants just a goof. And Mrs. Reagan was like, what the fuck is that on your face? It looks like a caterpillar. Big, fat thick. I look, I look like an aggressive gay man who makes sandwiches. I'm fuck guys. And I make sandwiches in my deli. You knew it works on Brian Jarvis. He's not comedian Brian Jervis at all. Brian Jarvis has eight. Tom Selleck, my stash. And if you'd know his comedy and he knew his face, it's just perfect.

Speaker 3:          00:32:19       You say aggressive gay man. Um, for a while I never knew that Chrystal myth was so popular in the gay community. I had no idea that meth and amphetamines and speed and an email nitrates and a bunch of like really crazy chemicals are so prevalent in the gay community. So I would occasionally run into dudes that were, especially around West Hollywood near the comedy store that had this weird, crazy fucking look in their eye. They were like really obviously gay. I didn't know there were hopped up on drugs. So in my silly 25 year old just moving to la mined out, I was like, wow, there's a certain look that some of these gay guys get when they're really crazy. I didn't realize that there's fucking like the hub of gay Matthews in the country, you know, that it was a sexual look like, oh my God, I just thought that's what they look like. Like it was like you, you have to have,

Speaker 1:          00:33:13       you have amazing radar for anything off kilter. It's like, it's like an animal of prey that sees like if you put a cow in a, in a, um, uh, not an animal print off of the cow is an animal fray. But like if you put an animal of flight in like a, um, a stall and there was a paint piece of like a string hanging that it hasn't seen, they won't go in that stall and you have a very good eye for, for something that's like that sharp f like there's, there's music and all of a sudden somebody comes in with a horn, like, ma'am, you know, you're like, ah, that's something you pick up on that stuff better than anybody. I know

Speaker 3:          00:33:42       I grew up without anybody protecting me. So I grew up in some weird situations and you know, we lived in a bunch of places where I didn't have any friends and I was forced at a very early age to try to kind of like get an objective sense of the world around me without listening to other people's opinions of it, without, you know, taking for granted that everyone else is paying attention and that they've got a grip on reality. To me, no one had a grip on reality. So I'm always like scanning everything. And when I, and I'm an honest person so when I see someone there's, there's something off. When I see something off it's literally like it smells to me and I always use two examples. One, I use the one with the girl with you when I met and this is a true story.

Speaker 3:          00:34:22       She's crazy. You've got to get out of here right now. She's crazy and it wasn't just, I wasn't just saying that this is maybe a crazy girl. I was like emphatic about it. It was cheese hot tab. I'm out and I didn't know it. She was doing meth and but I chose to move her into house anyway, but that's where it comes from. And the other one was this guy that turned out to be a child molester and my friend would, yon was on the podcast couple of weeks ago. We talked about it where I met the guy know right away they're hanging out with this guy. Like he's their friend, their buddy and right away I'm like, what the fuck is this guy doing here? What do it, this was like, everything was like all these alarms are going off. He calls me up a couple of weeks later and goes, you're not going to believe who just got arrested.

Speaker 3:          00:34:59       And he says that guy's name. Like, oh, he was a child child molester, right? And he goes, yeah. He goes, how the fuck did you know? I go, dude, I don't know. I don't know how I knew. But that was number one gas. I mean, when you were younger, you met this guy, you know? No, no, no, this is just a few years ago. But those are my two best examples of coming in and just pick up right away. I saw him and right away I was like, what the fuck? And I even said to the guy, what's up with that guy? What was it? I Dunno man. It was, everything smells the way he's moving, the way he was interacting with other people like young kids, penis. Well, so when you say smell stuff, when you say smell, that's a thing that they believe about psychosis, about some psychotic behavior may actually may actually be triggered by pheromones. And

Speaker 1:          00:35:38       literally you put out a certain smell and this is all theoretical and you know, they really don't exactly know like what causes some people psychotic episodes, but they think you put out a certain smell and then people smell this and they're put off by you. And so people are acting weird with you. So you think, am I weird? And it starts this chain reaction that literally can make a person slash go crazy. You know, we know. And we know when you, the worst thing you can do to a person in prison is to put them in solitary confinement and leave them alone with their own thoughts, without interacting with sample. So the psychosis is actually forms. Yeah, there's something that we need when we interact with people and when we get it wrong. Like if you literally smell off and I'm using the word smell because there's a smell like that, there's a real pheromones are like, you don't really smell it right.

Speaker 1:          00:36:23       Vibrate at the wrong frequency there. They're jerking differently there and your body, there's a good book. I mean, Malcolm Gladwell wrote that book, Blink about that, where you pay you a human. I can pick up a massive amount of information. Did you, did you ever hear, do you ever read that book? He uses? An amazing example of there was this, uh, this, uh, the Getty Museum paid a fortune, a fortune for a statute that was a young Greek boy. It was called a Kudos and they found the statute in Greece fully formed and they were like, Whoa, this is, this statue is like, I mean, they, they had never found something and it was worth a fortune. And again, he was going to pay something like 33, $100 million, some crazy amount, $30 million, whatever it is. And it was a lot of money. And so, but, but the thing is the Getty kept running these tests on it.

Speaker 1:          00:37:09       And this guy, the guy who was a career writer and people, the first thing that came to his mind, he said, when I saw it, there was something off. I said, what was it? He said, the first word that came to mind was fresh when I started. It looked fresh. He said, and if it's something's been in the ground for 5,000 years, it shouldn't come out looking fresh. So they ran all these tests. They dug into the marble really, really deep. They, they, they took the fung, the mold on the actual marble to see how old it was. And they did all these tests and they, I mean, literally spent a year testing it before they bought it. Okay. So now they buy it and they put it on display. I believe they brought it to Italy to or to show at this big, there was a traveling exhibit, exhibit, you know, and the minute they were setting it up to show as they pulled it off, I believe the, and if you guys are listening and you read the book, I, I, it's been a while since I read the books.

Speaker 1:          00:37:56       So, but for the art, for the story, say the curator of that museum, the guy who's the expert, they lifted the veil to show how they're going to present it. And he's after all these tests and he stopped anyway. He goes, w w w this, did you guys pay for this already? And I go, yeah, what are you talking about? Oh No, no. Can you get your money back? No, no, no. This is a fake. This is fake. And I go, what are you talking about? And he picked up on it. He picked up on what everybody else picked up on it. But they, but they were so excited that they actually found this thing that they didn't want to believe it. And he said, if you have to test for a year on the authenticity of something, all of you guys all have your experience minds. We're telling you right away there's something wrong here. And he goes, Ms. But he uses so many classic examples why watch

Speaker 4:          00:38:36       this? When he had, they had, they had people come to his office to a psychiatrist's office and they would, um, when they mentioned the words orange, Florida and raising people left the office much slower than they did otherwise. Why? Because when you mentioned orange, Florida and raising people thought of old people, retirees. And so young people would actually leave the office. They would walk down the hallway leaving the office much slowly, a lot slower than they did when they didn't hear those words. So what you hear, what, what is suggested to you has a profound effect on your physiology, not just your mind. And he was his so many incredible examples of this. I can't even tell you it's, it's incredible. So if you guys have, if you guys are listening, the book is called Blink and it's outstanding. All of Malcolm Gladwell's

Speaker 3:          00:39:25       books. So this guy in the, literally a blink of an eye saw this statue and new immediate Felton and the human eye, the human eye can, you can glance at something and pick up on everything, much more information than you can even imagine. And we have learned how to do that. It's called, um, he calls it slicing, I think broad slicing or something where you just, you know, pick up. I've always felt like there's more sentences than we can totally defined because there's a sense when someone's lying. There's a sense that it's very difficult to describe deceptive like language. Because if you looked at it on a computer, the timing seems to be pretty similar. I mean, if someone's good at it, yeah, they're timing is pretty similar to the someone who's being

Speaker 4:          00:40:03       lie detector do it measures in a very minute detail. Your breathing, your respiratory rate, all of these things, the heat of your skin and all that and that, that, that changes when you're not telling the truth. I've always,

Speaker 3:          00:40:15       well, unless you're a sociopath, if that goes off though, if you're nervous because you ever been innocent of something, but someone thinks you're guilty and when you're describing what actually happened, it sounds ridiculous and you feel like you're guilty or not guilty does. But a good a guy who knows

Speaker 4:          00:40:29       Britta lie detector it, we'll, we'll take that into account. And that's why when you do that, they ask you very simple questions. First they asked me, what's your name, what, where'd you grow up? And you, and then they'll start getting into it slowly. Um, and they, then they take that into account. Now a lot of guys telling you, you can throw off a lot of tech test by getting your body tight to begin with. And you said you fool it so you yeah,

Speaker 3:          00:40:49       get him to stay high as fuck. I don't know. I bet you sociopath on Lsd. It just blazed through them with sociopath's. Apparently it doesn't work because they don't care cause I don't care. No guilt.

Speaker 5:          00:40:59       You would think though, you could easily throw it off by just like every time he asks you a question and you just think of something like my dog dying.

Speaker 3:          00:41:05       Yeah, that's what they get. They can force you out of that. There's, there's like, they know that people do that. So there's tactics in order to like to trip you up with questions are Kinda will fuck with your emotions cause you don't know what the questions are going to be beforehand. So yeah, I know what you're saying though. I would think that to think about Spiderman every time they ask you, have you ever stole money from this bank? You think about spider.

Speaker 5:          00:41:23       Yeah. Like razor blades in your ass and it hurts so bad the whole time you're thinking about the reason I say razor blades in their ass.

Speaker 3:          00:41:29       Oh Brian, there's a thing that I wanted to talk about this. You were talking about that, um, that statute being a fraud, there's a thing called the Voynich manuscript. I don't know if you ever known or heard about this, but it was a book that was thought to have been written in the early 15th century and uh, it's in a language that no one could decipher. And they, uh, they sent this to the, all the top coders and the experts and the people that you know, decoded the Nazi signals in the, in the forties and the top coders in the world. And people have gone over it for decades. Nobody can figure out how to fucking decode it. They have no idea what this language is they have, it's all like illustrated with all these beautiful pictures. But nobody wanted to admit that since they had been working on this for so long, it might just be bullshit.

Speaker 3:          00:42:14       And that's what it turns out to this. It turns out that this is a, a guy, they think the guy that sold it, and Nigel initially to this void, each fellow was a, um, a con man and that he knew that Voynich loved old manuscripts so he can cocked it. This really elaborate old manuscript, completely detailed, uh, pictures of plants and all these different things. So it makes it look like there's all sorts of knowledge in this book, but it's hundred percent horseshit, a fake language. And he wrote a 205th 40 page fake language book and people have been studying it. So shit since fucking when did it get it? 1912. Incredible. 1912. So for a hundred fucking years, assholes have been going over this guy's fake book and people is suspected it. Early on people were like, well, what if it's a [inaudible]? No, no. And the more time goes on, the more they don't want to even think about the possibility that could have been a fake. Yeah. It's kind of like that. That's very human. It's very human.

Speaker 1:          00:43:08       Yeah. And this story, it's the been the beginning of the book is just incredible. Will you just say, wow, the Getty got duped by a comment and you know what they found the, uh, the, the, the, the mold on the, uh, on the, uh, cause it was taken from out from a type of um, uh, a type of marble that can only be found in a rock bed and like Thessaloniki or like one of these like, so that guy, the came from there and, and the, the, the mold, they have these tests that test the mold and how old it was. They, there's a type of mold that grows on a potato that you can grow on marble. So whoever did this knew exactly what they were doing. Wow. And they just got away with 30, 40, whatever million dollars to the, at the Getty calming, just cut, disappearing.

Speaker 1:          00:43:48       People are such bad ass. It's like talk about just calling all the way, like, yeah, found the statute because you want to buy it. Like even coming up with that like, hey guys, I've got an idea. Let's carve a statue out of marble. In the rock bed of Thessaloniki and we'll grow a potato mold on itself. A 40 minute get the fuck out of my office. What? Somebody must have a really known a lot about art to pull that off. That's what blows my mind. There are people out there that are just so good at stuff like that and that's how they do it. They just, they just hang the cut and they go, I'm gonna, I'm gonna rip off a museum. All the experts in the world. Yes it is.

Speaker 3:          00:44:21       It's a movie shit. It's like you heard about that Lee Martin Lee Marie Heist.

Speaker 1:          00:44:27       Oh yeah, the fighter MMA fighter from England million dollars. Something like it was in pounds. I don't

Speaker 3:          00:44:32       know how it translates, but you'll fight around a bank robber in the space. It was like the biggest heist in history. She let him out. Come on. They were masks and guns and they literally like planned it all out and timed it all out to the alarms. They did it like a goddamn movie and he's in a jail in Morocco and Morocco won't send them back over. Morocco's Morocco is pretty looked out like if you're a Moroccan citizen, they protect you was a bit a few fighters that got in trouble and just bolted to Morocco. Like Badr Hari, Hari gotten a bit of travel bolted to Morocco once you're Morocco, man, they kicked take care of their own. So they love fighters in Morocco, but leemary man, he just fucked up too large. They had to come after him even in Morocco and when he was in Morocco, by the way, on the lamb, he beat a guy up and kidnapped him.

Speaker 3:          00:45:18       Oh my God. Rock God. He wasn't slowing down. He got to [inaudible]. I had a feeling he runs that prison yard. Oh, he's an animal. Yeah. That guy was a, he's quite a character. That guy got almost stabbed to death. He got stabbed like some insane amount of times. His heart stopped a couple times. They had to restart them on the fucking operating table and he had a video online of him six to eight weeks I think after open heart surgery, hitting the pads, he's, he then the like lean Mary's back and chose Lean Mary. They like bobbing and weaving and throwing combinations in the pads to six fucking weeks after open heart surgery. We are flight. I'm going to take a nap. I'm tired. I wish I know the exact amount of weeks it was. It might not have been six, it might have been 12 whatever it was.

Speaker 3:          00:46:02       It was fucking ridiculous. This guy had just had open heart surgery. Nelson, he's hitting the pants and he's getting ready to fuck people up. That's when he's saying, he's like, I'm back. You fucking bitches. He's thrown a punch. The pads, like this guy was getting hard with a knife and I'll still kick your ass. He's a legit gangster. He's, that guy was legit originally from England. Well, he lived in England and lived in, fought out of England. Flotsam tough guys to man fought Anderson Silva went the distance with them. Wow. And Anderson was a really coming into his own as when Anderson came the cage rage craze. Anybody pull off? Huge high. A very good question, man. A Guy just pulled off a fucking Picasso Heist in San Francisco because it's different though, because the art is a really good thing to get into because first of all, jury is considered it like a victimless crime.

Speaker 3:          00:46:43       So a lot of times you don't do a lot of time. And also there's always, and also there's just people that that you can unload it with. It's an interesting story that this one, this guy walked into a gallery, picked it up off the wall, walked out, got in a cab, took off. Nobody noticed him taking this Picasso sketch off a wall. Wow, that's worth like 200 grand. And he just grabs it and leaves. But the thing is like, good luck selling it. How are you going to sell that thing? Everyone knows what it is. You know what I mean? You're constantly, there's private sellers. I'm really rich, Jeff Cha Cha, Chinese tycoon who lives like you know in Manchuria and Watson on his wall. Yeah. You would have to know exactly who that guy is. That's like a tricky situation that Picasso for sale give me a hundred grand.

Speaker 3:          00:47:25       Yeah, but that's how you get caught though too. You know, they sell it me. Well, you got to let the guy who's selling it make a big, big piece of the Pie. That's what you've got to do. If you've got something like that and stolen and you're smart, what you would do is he would go to someone and say, listen man, we both know this thing's worth 200 grant. Give me a hundred you know, it's funny, you take a hundred grand off of it, and then the guy's like, okay, well I just made a good fucking chunk of money. Now this is worth my risk and I can ensure both of our safety's, but I don't think criminals, I don't, couldn't think criminal. I'm, I'm like a gentleman criminal. Yeah, exactly. I don't think criminals like that do it for the money. I think criminal charge and you know, we all have, some people have to get drunk. Some people have to get, you know, they have to do blow. Other people just have to do crime. It's the same guy. I'd recommend Jujitsu. My friends get in there and get your freak on. I start rolling and get back in there. Buddy Javier victims, who have you ever heard of him is, I'm half a mile away.

Speaker 3:          00:48:19       His brother going there, but hey, it's Javier here. Javier is his brother. That's like, you know for is not that big a deal man. I'm telling you I haven't got the real deal. I gave him an award at the MMA awards at Fau February's here. He is such a giant is a huge dude. He's just a huge guy. He's a bad ass Jujitsu guy. If this was just Jujitsu, if MMA was just Jujitsu like it, see he's one of those guys that really became an MMA fighter as a Jujitsu champion and had to learn everything else from scratch. And you're like, when you first like first fought all Lawsky like you look at that fight like had no striking. Even when he fought Alastar the first time had very little strike. Yeah. He just wanted to get guys to the ground and when he got out, started the ground back then he submitted them.

Speaker 3:          00:48:57       Yeah. It's a shame that there's not like professional Jujitsu and professional wrestling. Yeah, but there's not real money and it, you know what I mean? I mean like, and wrestling as well, man, like real professional wrestling. It should be a game. To me, that's a very small audience who, I'm going to say that, but fucking golf is on TV, man. That's boring as fuck. If you know, you could watch like real, like high level wrestlers, all that. You can't tell me that if you didn't get someone to explain it correctly, you get some really passionate wrestling champion guide. Explain it correctly. Almost think that people would watch wrestling did wrestle. So they know the difference. I don't know about that man. I think people could watch it. Just like, I swear to God, I could watch golf. I know it's boring as fuck, but I can watch it.

Speaker 3:          00:49:38       There's a conclusion. I know what their conclusion is. This guy's going to hit that thing. And if it's going, it goes in there, then he's happy. And if it doesn't go in there, oh, he's fucked. You know what I mean? So in that simple little, I don't play golf and I don't know what strokes on power. You should never pick up golf because you'll become quicker. I'm going to touch it. But you're, you're so, you're so obsessive outside. You'll love it. I can't do it. Well I wouldn't do it. Well that's what I always think about. Like when, why would you play pool? You know, like if it was outside, wouldn't he make it all inside? That'd be ridiculous because then he could play in the rain. Like Golf, you can't play in the rain. Like especially in the east coast. They're like, I know when you get an addiction you don't want to have to take the time off. In the winter. I played pool all through the winter. You know, you can always, yeah,

Speaker 5:          00:50:15       you can still play in the rain. And that's what kind of makes it different than pool is that your environment's always changing. So it's not like the same flat surface every time you're like, hey, now the pool table, it's like you're in a mountain and there's an ocean in the middle of it, you know? That is cool. And it

Speaker 3:          00:50:28       also is cool that you have to adjust for like the wind and shit like that. I think about like you're playing against nature a little bit office is that saying it's like they're the longest distances that one, the one the distance between your ears, you know it's all mental. So as his pool pool is, what you're doing with pool is you are have a slippery surface of a fast Simona's eight 60 cloth, right? It's, it's not even like felt. People think of it, it's felt, but it's a cloth and the balls roll very nice and smooth and even on that and the balls are all waxed and cleaned and they all weighed the perfect amount of weight. They all weigh the same exact weight and these balls, you're colliding one ball into another trying to send it into a very small space. You know, usually in pro tournaments it's four and a half inch pockets. So you have very little room for error and you're calculating the exact distance, the amount of rotations that ball's going to make on this slip cloth to get your ball in the perfect position for the next shot. And it becomes this weird zen thing.

Speaker 1:          00:51:24       Do you know, on, on that speaking of balls colliding into each other? Um, you know, you know what, that, that collider actually that's super collider in Switzerland accident. You know what it actually does, you know what they're trying to figure out? The Higgs Boson particle? Yeah. The God particle. Well, when we are, well actually they're that they're trying to prove that Spring Siri, this notion that there are other dimensions where matter goes, right. And so when they collide these things together, it within this, this chamber, when these two atoms I guess, or is that what the [inaudible] gonna hit them at? And they, when they, when they collide, they give off to debris. They give off energy. If that energy goes away, if part of that energy kind of doesn't, isn't there anymore with that would prove that those tiny particles that are, that are made actually smaller than quarks are going somewhere else and that's how they're trying to prove that there are other dimensions.

Speaker 5:          00:52:14       Yeah, but does that even make sense? Like what of those article burnout, you know what I mean? Like, like I know they said that energy can never die or whatever. And if, if those, that those particles go into another dimension, but what if those particles just died? You know what? We were just wrong about that.

Speaker 3:          00:52:28       I don't know. Here's why. Here's why. Because particles can, the two things can happen. There's the answer. There's a lot of confusion when it comes to subatomic particles and when it comes to any kind of quantum theory, because it gets started, it gets kind of culty and weirdy and it sort of gets a lot. A lot of it is theoretical, but here's what they do know. They do know that particles can exist and not exist. At the same time. They can be in two different places at the same time and they're the same particle and they can disappear and reappear and we don't know where they're going. But there they do go somewhere and that seems to indicate a level of evidence at least some in infants, Massimo subatomic level that there is some sort of a a passage way where where things go from one place and come back. String theory is that based on on this

Speaker 1:          00:53:14       notion that these, that, that at the end of it, the very smallest particles are all of these sort of vibrating circles of light and those are so small that they can fit into different, different I guess of where,

Speaker 4:          00:53:26       and the idea behind string theory is that you have the Newtonian reality which is the reality you and I live in, which is gravity and everything else. And then you have the Subatomic, a reality which is, which is whenever you get into sub atomic and subatomic world, a lot of times the very laws that govern us are in fact the opposite. Light Bends, gravity collapses on itself. All these things I don't know about but I mean they'll talk about string theory is the, is is what Einstein called this unification theory. This one thing that brings all of it together so that you have one theory that can explain how the world really works.

Speaker 3:          00:53:59       There's still a lot of controversy with it. Yeah. Imagination. Yeah,

Speaker 4:          00:54:03       but they, but they are proving with math, with with mathematics is a very good lecture on it and Ted but, but they're proving with they can prove with math that there are um, that there are

Speaker 3:          00:54:17       oh 11 dimensions, 11 dimensions, no idea of the fuck they prove it. I don't, someone says that I just repeated, oh they proved it with math. But you know

Speaker 4:          00:54:25       the answer to that, that theory that, that question they were coming up with the answer was 357 pages long. All numbers.

Speaker 3:          00:54:32       It looks like fun reading. She's a school talking about, it's like anything else man. It's like what we discussed when we were talking about fighting and MMA fighter is literally like trying to get an argument with someone and all you have is a language book. Like for the average person, they speak a different language or speak the language of mathematics and they've been speaking this language for decades and decades and they go deep, deep, deep into the rabbit hole.

Speaker 4:          00:54:52       It's all well cause it's cause cause the mathematical theory it was where you go is it is all imagination. You know, you see these guys, they're actually really like, you know this one dude is working on that. The particle collider. It gave this lecture at Ted Young, really good looking kid like dressed like with these awesome clothes and just kind of like cheese. You don't get laid Dhea and, and, and, and yet he says

Speaker 3:          00:55:10       brilliant businesses like brilliant physicist, physicist sort of have a history of being skirt chasers. If you go back to Fineman, those like one of fireman's, there was like, there was like a bubble chart that would be like our girls around if no girls around, you know, here's where it comes. Physics. Here's what's great about that is that I'm not that smart and I have nothing to talk to girls about. For the most part. I wonder what those guys have. Fine, but it was just such a genius. I mean, he was just, he was so, he was such a good talker too, and he had like kind of a cool accent too because even though he was a genius, he had a very sort of an ethnic east coast accent, which is really odd. This guy, this guy who I'm talking about, he's from Manchester and she talks like that, you know, and he's not, he's unbelievable.

Speaker 3:          00:55:49       He's got long black hair and he wears this great sort of, you know these fast. I'm like, dude, you accent. You got, you got hair like Johnny Depp and you're off your and you can help build that collider. You're one of the leading minds in your 28 no, my father guys, Aubrey de grey. Do you know who he knows? He's the guy who's trying to make people live forever and he has this incredible Maine. Oh, I know exactly what that all drinks. I'm here like every day. Yeah, he's awesome. He's amazing. Did you know Ray Kurzweil now has transcendent man? He came out without, yeah, there's a documentary. We've talked about it a hundred it's a bread. I love that guy with that long beard. He's like,

Speaker 1:          00:56:24       awesome. People can live forever. Yeah, well he's fucking on the cusp. I mean that guy is at the head of, you know, the, all the creative ideas about genetic engineering and you know, fucking crazy. Redoing Oregon's, you know, they, they created a windpipe recently with stem cells. Did you see that as an artist? What I took out? Yeah. Well they, I think they, what they did is they took a, a cadaver's wind pipe and sprayed it with stem cells and grew over the cartilage. Yeah. Which is like, okay, cool. And then they installed it and the guy's neck and now he can breathe. Yup. And they didn't say anything with the bladder's just at the beginning of some really smart guy, I can't remember his name. And he went, we've not invented anything. I tell people that and they don't understand. Nothing's been invented yet. Just wait for the next 40 years. Oh yeah, you're around for the next century. It's going to fuck everything. You know,

Speaker 3:          00:57:11       out the window. I put up with something on my Twitter yesterday about a three d printer and it was on a television show. There was a video of it on live leak and this three d printer, this guy takes a wrench and they put the wrench into a copier and the copier looks at the ranch and figures out how the wrench is built and then makes it out of resin. Big Set of this incredibly hard resin where you can actually use it as a fucking wrench. So this thing literally physically made this wrench with moving parts and prints it all in one piece. That's so genius. You know how a wrench has that thing in the middle where you have to screw it with your thumb to adjust it? Yeah. Well, it made that all in one printing and it made that part that screws what? Your thumb a different color. So the adjustment wheel was a different color. It was red and the rest of the thing was gray and it printed it in one, three d form. It's fucking incredible. You just tweeted that video.

Speaker 1:          00:58:02       Yeah. Yeah. Just what, that's why, you know, you can, uh, you can talk about magic technology is way more incredible than any kind of magic you can think of. I mean, it is magic. I mean that's probably what magic is. All these stories of magicians, it's probably just they came upon some fucking idiots. It didn't have fire yet. You know, they came upon some dummies, you didn't have guns and they had bank sticks and they fucking just dominated shit. That's it. Yeah. I mean look what fucking magic would everybody forgot it. They remember everything else. I like that. If we got all the magic and transcendent man where they were talking about basically that we are going to mesh with machines, there's no question and our biology is going to die off as you make eyes that work better as you make skin that can heat up as you make, you know, your body's going to start meshing with bio compatible components that mimic and are in fact better than the very material you currently live in.

Speaker 1:          00:58:50       And, and it's going to be a world where people are going to decide to go that way or the people who decide, you know what I'm going to die like with my old biological self of it's going to be interesting. It's going to be interesting to figure out what, what would people choose to fight very though about that movie is just the story about him and his father. Right? Right. Yeah. Man recreated that was about a guy who really misses his father and he doesn't accept death. Yeah. Well that's suspicious thing except the people that fuck bucket. I'm going to something where they don't. You're like, yeah, well it was, it was obviously to him it really like

Speaker 3:          00:59:22       defined him as a human. Yeah. I loved his father and you know that's the same story with that guy, Ronald Mallet, the professor out of the University of Connecticut, that's the leading theorist on time travel. It's father died when he was a kid and it freaked him out so bad that he dedicated his life to developing a time machine because he wants to go back in time and saves all man. If that doesn't make you want to fucking cry. And this guy's like, no, he's in his fifties and he was like the leading. And not only that, he's figured out it at least theoretically through his studies that that would actually be impossible and that what's going to happen with the time machine, that the current theory is that when a time machine is invented, what the issue becomes is then all time ceases to become linear because everyone from the invention of that time machine on to the end of time can come back to that moment in time and any moment in between. And anytime they choose. So time loses all of its linear quality, but only the moment the doors opened. That's when it happens. So literally the, the, the idea is that the way they describe it as you can't travel where there are no roads once the road has been created from that moment in time on time ceases to become what we define as time today.

Speaker 4:          01:00:28       You know, I, I had a Einstein's theory of gravity and, and, and they explained to me, well like, well for example, it's not as 93 million miles away from the earth. Why does it, why does it have an effect? Why does it, why is it gravity? It's gravity effect the earth and so on and so forth. Why does the moons have the same relationship with the earth? And the way I sent him scrap, it was really interesting. He said time and space bends, it bends according to whatever object is essentially in it. So if you look at time and space as a blanket, a tight blanket and you drop a pool ball on it, what happens to the blanket is there's an indentation then. So, so that's essentially what it's doing to time and space. It's bent that plane of time and space. That's a way, wild way of looking at it.

Speaker 4:          01:01:12       Now it's spinning. Now take another ball. The smaller ball is rotating within around that because it's, it's, it's created an indentation there and its own orbit. So your, so that little ball is now going around the, you know, the perimeter of where that one ball is sitting. It creates a board. And that's how Einstein described gravity to a four year old. He said, this is how gravity and time works. And uh, and of course the farther away you get from that, the less you spin or the longer it takes to complete one revolution, which means then that you get, as you go farther away, you know, you come, you, you don't age as quickly. I mean time goes by much slower. That's right. That is, it takes them longer. Why to, it takes him longer to evolve around whatever, whatever is exerting gravity on you. But isn't that

Speaker 3:          01:02:00       crazy thought that you could escape gravity and live longer? Yeah. Technically you would live longer. That's right. And when you would,

Speaker 4:          01:02:06       oh my God, I have to go out

Speaker 3:          01:02:08       relative like to for you, like what I'm saying is if you went out and you were 30 years at the speed of light and then you came back and everyone was dead,

Speaker 4:          01:02:16       the people that were children were old people. You would be the same age,

Speaker 1:          01:02:20       but you would feel like you would only lived 30 years or whatever the fuck it was. You wouldn't feel like you've gone through, no. You would probably a hundred years be real for you, I guess in your time in 30 years time. Sure. What, how does that fucking word moving slower? Like what's going on? You're actually, if you're, if you're c because I as you as take the, take the uh, the, the sheet and then take the ball that's in the middle of the sheet. As you rotate around that ball, if you're close to that ball, it takes, you know, it's a smaller circle, isn't it? As you get out farther, it's like a record player. Take a record player. If I put you on on the first line, it's going to take you a much shorter time to make a complete revolution. I put you at the end of the record player is going to take you a long time to call it rally round.

Speaker 1:          01:03:09       That's time. And as you go further out, it takes you much longer to complete a year. You're, it's a, it's a really wild concept but, but that is where time and space bends. So that's where my feeble brain loses its short circuiting because one reason why I'm losing it is because why is it take more time when you're out further? When in the earth I time it going faster. I understand that there's revolutions, but why are you not aging and feeling the same thing as those people on earth? If it's, it's like I can't, the idea of alternate versions of time and in space traveling at a speed, it's too much. What's amazing though is that it's, it's been proven with subatomic. Um, um, uh, when Einstein came up with these theories, we didn't have atomic clocks and things. We didn't have the actual tools to prove it.

Speaker 1:          01:04:02       And it wasn't until later on when we actually came up with the technology and the math to prove it, especially the instruments to measure it and when we can't with the instruments of measurement later on, say 30 40 years later, it turned out the guy was right. You know? That's when you know you're really smart when you're like, I've got a theory. You guys don't actually even have the machines to measure this, but here's how it goes. Madison being the first guy to be like, ah, if I shoot your way out, time, time and space bends like a blanket. Let me show you what this pool ball, and he'd be like, what the fuck this guy's, what's what the gray haired guy. Fuck. All I'm thinking about is banging girls and what's, that's when he was in it too, you know, kind of a pimp.

Speaker 1:          01:04:40       Einstein and Picasso said, a man does everything for women. He fights bulls, he does it all. He Paints, fuck it. He goes to war for women so he can look good and come back with a bunch of metals on his chest. I'm not saying that's the case with everybody. It's amazing how guys like Einstein and guys like Nikola Tesla, they live amongst you and I, but they literally couldn't be any further from the type of person, especially you and die. You and I are like mirror images of each other. We always have been our whole lives. It was like what I'm, when I first met Brian, it was on mad TV with his companies, got rid of it and a, I was like, who's this fucking guy was just was like immediately was like, we

Speaker 3:          01:05:18       were the same age. We're both ridiculous. We were both like, we can't believe I'm in fucking Hollywood. I'm on a TV show. I'd be like, I can't believe I'm on a fucking TV show either. Where are you from? Do you know why? You know? I got along with really well. I just did a show of hands and I really liked with Jay Moore. Jamie and I hit it off right away. He loves you. He was talking, he's a great guy. He's a, he's a, he's an east coast, so smart ass felt so comfortable with the guy. He's such a, he looked in my ears as good. So you wrestle. I go, yeah. And he used to wrestle. I didn't know that. Oh really? Yeah, he was a wrestler and he's just, he's funny man. He kills me. He's a funny guy, man. He's a silly goose.

Speaker 3:          01:05:51       Yeah, he's a sort of a talked about you guys, guy sort of a comedian. He loves you. He lot of comics don't like him because of that. You know, they don't like that jockey sense of humor. He's a great guy. Yeah. He gets shit for that. I've heard that about him. You know, some comp, they don't let that hold Jame or style. They should lift weights and take some test task. Stop being fucking UNAMERICAN. Cause Jim Morris a good American on the merge. Have you been following this marijuana thing that they just released the reports on? I the MED medical, yeah. The federal government has declared there's no medical, no. Uh, I forget the wording, but no valid medical use for marijuana, which is his fucking ridiculous. We have a friend that has a, a brother that has, he's on the autism spectrum. I mean, he, uh, he communicates with you. He's, you know, he's right there, he's present, but he's very, very shy. And you give this kid pot and you can noticeably see him relax. And it's been known to alleviate a lot of, uh, the, the social anxiety and the, the, the, the weirdness that autistic people having communication it with

Speaker 4:          01:06:55       my own eyes. I've seen it, I've seen that very same example of somebody who was a high functioning autistic who would smoke weed and would literally become lucid. And so, you know, you can say what you want. It's a chemical that's going to affect your brain. Maybe some people that affects them negatively, other people, it's gonna affect them positive. But, you know, Eh, if you're gonna, if you're gonna tell me that, if you look at the amount of damage just in money terms and by the way in lives that alcohol does versus we'd, one of the funniest, craziest things that make no sense that weeds illegal, but, but I'll call I, I, okay. It's crazy. I mean it's it, it's terrible the first person to talk about this, but yeah, or exactly what I mean. It's, it's an example of how slowly in some ways things change.

Speaker 4:          01:07:37       They change very slowly because when people get ideas, ideas have ideas or really what move and change everything in the world and it goes back to these guys like Tesla. When you think about people who were thinking of truly seminal ideas, like somebody will sit around and they fucking just sit around and think like up new constructs. They change everything that we, they change everything for the next hundred years. What a privilege. What an amazing accomplishment. Like what an amazing accomplishment I'm going to, I'm going to come up with, I'm going to change everybody. Everybody in the world's paradigm, I'm going to change you live the rest of your life. That's what, that's what it is.

Speaker 3:          01:08:17       Well, with these guys at the large Hadron collider and doing her literally changing our interface with reality. Yeah. I mean they, they, they have a new kind of matter. You know this cork gluon plasma shit that they came up with. One sugar cube was like 40 billion tons. I mean they're doing things that people have only theorized for the longest time and it's never going to stop. This is what I tell people, and I joke around about this on stage, that we're here to make the big bang and this is like a whole bit about the large Hadron collider. They might be like the destiny of human beings to reset the universe. We will never stop. Whatever we learned from the large Hadron Collider, we will apply to the next greater thing because it's going to keep going on and if we survive 100 years, the exponential increase of technology, you just used the word, it's exponential. It will be national development. It'll be beyond our imagination. We were not, we cannot fathom a reality that will be so far removed from the one that we currently experience. Right. That's good. That's fun.

Speaker 5:          01:09:10       From what I understand what that marijuana think. No, this is actually the third time this has happened where the US government has said no, this, there's nothing good with this shit ya and but it's a good for us because now we can take it to the courts or whatever the federal court or and and go against everything they say. So like if they say no, this doesn't help headaches and we can like put the proof up like no, it does. Here's 5,000 scientists. So this is actually a good thing that they did this.

Speaker 3:          01:09:36       It's very obvious that the system is rigged. The only reason why people would be going after marijuana in this day and age, we're wasting any resources on something that kills nobody is they're getting paid to do it. It's really simple. You have to follow the money. There's, there's no

Speaker 4:          01:09:49       money. Anytime you pass any kind of law, cottage industry grows up around it. There was an article that was a big debate about ethanol today and there's an ethanol lobby lobby and ethanol, ethanol problems. I don't know, you got to quote a lot of corn and it's not that efficient. It's not that economical. It's proven to be not. We've got only 10 million cars on the road that actually are flex fuel compatible, which means basically a 5% of the cars on the road right now in the United States and and yet you have a lobby and ethanol lobby. You have 30 plants. Try getting rid of ethanol. Go ahead. Good luck.

Speaker 3:          01:10:21       The whole lobby thing man is always freaked me the fuck out that that's legal and that no one ever says anything constitutional

Speaker 4:          01:10:27       Ander under this you, the reason you have lobbyists and you always have had lobbyists is because in the constitution you have the right to petition your government. The the, the, the, the reason lobbying comp, the reason lobbying has become such a force and the reason politicians essentially are beholden to the NRA and these kinds of people is essentially because whenever you create, as the government becomes bigger and has more influence, which is what it's going to do as it grows, regardless of what side right? Left is not a right and left to argument. If something like this gets bigger, you are going to have industry that that is going to find a way to influence that power structure. How do you do it? You hire people who have contacts with the government. Either they work for the administration, whatever might be, but that's what happens.

Speaker 4:          01:11:15       So now you have, now you have a county like Potomac in, in, in uh, Maryland, which is one of the richest I think is probably the third richest county in the world. Do you think they manufacturer anything now? You know what they are? They're all government lobbyists. Isn't that amazing? When my, when when you try to go from Potomac to uh, Washington DC to the capitol, you'll be in the car for about two hours and it's about 20 miles away or whatever it is. It's a parking lot. Why? Because they're producing anything. Are they producing things? You and I can use nat. You know what they're doing. It's a machine. It is a group of people from all different kinds of industries that live there 24, seven and do whatever they can to influence their congressmen in their state. That's how it works, baby. And so, so when you start talking about government, understand, I've said this before, I always say regardless of what side of the aisle you're on, government has two functions to pass laws and to end to tax.

Speaker 4:          01:12:14       Do you need laws and taxes? Absolutely. The question is always in political philosophy. How much do you need? Okay. And it seems to me that we're headed to a point where governments can be 42% of GDP. I mean, we, we government is taking over so much. So many people in this country are dependent on a government paycheck. That's not the American way. And I'll tell you something, it means you're a bureaucratic, it doesn't necessarily, you're, some people are doing good things, they're doing good things. But for the most part, the, the, the, uh, country grows when it starts, when it produces things you and I need, whether it's intellectual ideas, physical products, uh, and we export those things and we are, we need to stay the leader of innovation, innovation and ideas is what it is so high. But when you have Potomac being that rich, because they basically would lie on the u s government, there's something fucking very wrong, very creepy that it just keeps going on and it never even gets mentioned because it's very hard to stop.

Speaker 4:          01:13:07       To me, it's one of the two great things about politics that have always fascinated me. That's one and two is cigarettes. The fact that no one ever brings up cigarettes, there's never a present president that says we have to stop something that's killing literally almost a half a million, you know? Can I, you know what I love about that example you just used in, in health and human resources. There's a building in Washington where you can go down one floor and there is a, it's it's health and human health and human resources or the health department. The Department of Health and Department of Health had to huge campaign to get people to stop smoking and it's a good noble program. You go up three flights from there or whatever it is, but it's in the same building and you have a essentially a the department of agriculture. You know what the Department of Agriculture does, it pays farmers to produce tobacco because it's called a subsidy.

Speaker 4:          01:13:52       Interesting, isn't it? So you got one floor that's paying farmers to grow tobacco because they have a strong lobby. And then if you go down three floors, you've got the Department of Health, which is trying to get people to stop smoking. You find me one business in the world that behaves that way. But guess what? It's the u s government baby and that's how we work. And that's your taxes go. Your taxes go to stopping people from smoking with big, big programs and they go to getting farmers to grow more tobacco. That's what it's called. So it's called fucking madness. It is. And that's why if you don't educate yourself on how the government works and what the history of expansive government is, you're gonna pay a price for it out of your pocket book. And with your freedom. It doesn't seem like as the economy corrodes and they start trying to add more and more government jobs, people don't, they don't want to resist this because it does provide some sort of a tangible boosting economy.

Speaker 4:          01:14:44       They've created 2 million jobs, but you don't do, they don't tell you that these 2 million jobs are all sensor sends a census. Census People, census takers, useless jobs, exact things that we don't need. Exactly. You know, it's just pay attention. When you hear a politician talk, pay attention to what they're really asking for it. It's a very, very interesting thing because it, the, the, and all of us would be guilty of this would the nature of human beings, if you, in my opinion, you look at history is to, is to try to control other people. I try to do it. I try to do it with people I love. I try to, I try. I try to help them. I try to, I'm trying to control them. I tell them how to eat. It's my nature. I care about people, so what am I going to do?

Speaker 4:          01:15:24       I'm going to try to get in there and I'm gonna try to educate you according to My, my paradigm. Well that's just my nature. I'll never be any different. The problem, the founding fathers knew that was part of human nature and that's why they created a checks and balances. That's why they created the, the nation. This nation was founded on the idea that you are self reliant, that, that, that, that we you, if you're going to create a alliances and stuff, they should be voluntary alliances, not government mandated alliances, et cetera. And we're headed to a point where people are trying to solve problems and, and, and that means I'm going to, I'm going to pass a government mandate. I'm going to make you do this. Do you know how the tobacco lobby thing works? Do you know how they pay the farmers? The farmers get paid for their tobacco, plus they get paid to grow it.

Speaker 4:          01:16:07       Is that how it goes? Hey to it? We'll look at yes. Oh look. Just to make sure that there's like everybody, let me give you another example. Do you think we need as much corn as we do? You think we need all that corn syrup? Do you think in fact, why don't we grow sugar anymore? Because the corn lobby lobby, I think it's Archer Daniel Midlands, uh, et cetera. Uh, I have a very strong lobbying groups. So they said, let's, let's, we want to grow corn. We have a lot of people that will be out of work if you don't subsidize our industry. You know how much money we give. We give, we give out pack a farmer's money every year. You ever worn anything without Paca in it? Yeah. It's an animal that, and what happened was during the Korean War, uh, we decided to make uniforms out of our pack Alpaca. And I'll pack a blend because they would be warmer because Korea is very fucking cold. But guess what? Those farmers, they're still, they're still getting paid to grow alpacas to, to hurt Alpacas and your, you pay for it. Now it might be 0.1% out of your paycheck, but that's what goes

Speaker 1:          01:17:09       on with the government. That's what government, that's what, that's what farming subsidies are about. That we pay people to produce butter. We have a lot of food. No, I said, yeah, I'm just saying like every, if you have a farm, you get money. Is that every, does it every crop, the, I don't know all the details, but for Reed Zachary, I wrote a really good book about all this stuff that everybody should be, you should meet him. He's smart. What's it called? I believe it's called the history of freedom. And I read some excerpts of it. It was unbelievable. There was no way to stop the lobby system at this point though, is there, I mean, is there no one's gonna no one's gonna accept. There absolutely is. They, in fact, I would argue that there's a huge movement, uh, to, to bring government on both sides of the aisle to bring government into a manageable price.

Speaker 1:          01:17:55       You know, it's small to make it smaller. I mean every time they're on pell Paul Dogma, but nobody's, so we actually, every time you hear a politician now wants to get to be elected, they all have to justify their spending. And let me tell you something. We are in, we are in dire, I mean a lot of government programs are being cut and the whole tea party movement, which is a formidable movement in some ways. Uh, and Michelle Bachmann and these guys, they, they, their platform is basically like, no matter what you say, the government's too big. Now I have some issues with those guys, but I'm just saying that at the end of the day they gained that much traction because they said, what the Hell's going on here? Got Michele Bachmann is one of two things. Either she's the bringer of the apocalypse or she's a see someone hired by the Democrats to completely discredit the Republicans because she's at the helm right now.

Speaker 1:          01:18:39       She's at the, I did a little wasted movement research on her. I was, how about her gay husband? I don't know anything about his fuck. Really. Dave Foley turned me onto it. Oh, you got to watch the guy talk. It's fantastic. Yeah. Married 35 years ago on the podcast. He's one of those guys that curious people being gang. Oh No. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Oh he's gay as fuck. You just hear him talk and he can't hold the gay back. Yeah, I have a huge problem with every like called customer service somewhere and you know you're talking to a black guy. Yeah. That's how gay is. You know, and I'm not saying that every black guy talks like that, but there are certain black guys at man you call the guy up on the phone and I'm not saying there's anything wrong with it, but you know, you're talking to a black guy.

Speaker 1:          01:19:13       This guy is one of those guys. You hear him talking and go, that's a gay guy. There's no doubt about it. And he just talks about barbarians, gay people being barbarians Healy. And we need to tell them that this kind of behavior is just not acceptable. What asshole sucking cock and prayer retreats and just can't self self loathing. He's got self-loathing and he's married. I can't stand hypocrites. I can't stand people like that. She wants to get rid of all porn too, which is hilarious because then the rapes would go through the fucking roof. It's one of the things that they've realized in one thing. They actually believe could help child pornography could actually help child molesters not have sex with children. It's a terrible idea. Scientifically, scientifically though they're proposing that this actually could be a possibility because wood with, um, it's, it's terrible idea, but you know that you obviously could never do it because those kids and those videos are victims, but regular pornography has been shown to curb rape.

Speaker 1:          01:20:04       Regular pornography in other countries is accepted in Japan, especially that pornography and even violent things actually keep people from acting out. A lot of psychological studies about the fact that, you know, movies like saw and stuff, there's prop, there are less maniacs out there actually doing it because they can simulate, they can see it being done and get off on you bolt. Yeah. And I, they think they believe this about pornography as well. Sex pornography, actually curbs rape totally makes sense. It does. Yeah. I mean, look, there's gotta be some reason for it and that doesn't make sense. I mean, it doesn't have to be some reason for it, but I think the way the made world moves outlaw pornography. I want to make my own choices. I'm a fucking adult. You fucking, what are you? I mean the, the Nazis were very good at, at totalitarianism, at controlling the total person too.

Speaker 1:          01:20:48       That's, that's tyranny. It's a form of tyranny. When people start talking that way that people want to keep your gay people like fucking worry about your own kitchen, asshole. I never had a gay person come in and fuck up my whole, the way they are. They fucking up my, my fam, my family unit with their presence. Is that how weak my family unit bond is? Are they tempting me within Cox shot hop? Yeah, they are actually. Sorry. Hi. Yeah, dude, I'm with Ya. I'm with you on the whole ranch. There's a bunch of people in this country though that don't think that way. That's one of the things about this world is that, you know, there's, there's people in this life that are at various stages of awakening and I'm not claiming to be any enlightened being, but there's people that have the benefit of having more free time or open minded friends live in a better geographic environment where people think a little clear.

Speaker 1:          01:21:38       I'm very open minded. There's a lot of people though in certain spots of this country alone and forget about the rest of the world, but certain spots of the country, but they're just in some fucked spot. His spot, they're was just filled with dummy. I just think, I also think that there's, there's a lot of social pressure to stay, stay the course, you know, I think it goes back to kind of keeping like the breeding instinct. I was thinking about this, I was trying to write stay the course. So you say, you mean like as far as like Christian values and notice how it feels? Shy Guy in a working class, neighborhood of Boston walks in with bangles and earrings and I shadow he gets beaten up. Why? Why is that though? Why I have a theory. Why remember like a mud up David, I'll use this thing when he was in Jersey and he'd go to school and his mom would pack pita bread and he'd get the shit kicked out of pita bread.

Speaker 1:          01:22:22       He's like, hey ma, you know, give me white bread. Cause I know Pete, it's good for me, but it's not good for me when I get my fucking teeth knocked him for being a communist because I'm eating pita bread. Right. It's hilarious. But why, and I have a theory on it. Men, if you look at like how men developed, like men are really good in groups. They delineated authority very quickly. They, they uh, they work well. They're very organized. They like hierarchy. They don't talk a lot. If they have a job to do, they get it done. Think about like, you know when they're like, well, like when you're hunting, it goes back to hunting. When you got to hunt a deer, you gotta, you gotta, you gotta you're using hand signals, you're not talking to, he'll scare the deer away. So you, you, you get into this whole, this whole sort of, you know, uh, a very organized, you become one unit.

Speaker 1:          01:23:00       I machine women don't bond that way. They tend to talk and, and, and they, they verbally, men actually don't. Men Bond. If you take boys and you take a ball and throw it in the middle of a bunch of boys don't know each other, they'll be come friends around that ball. Cause they start playing a game and they break up into teams and they compete with, they have to rely on each other and they get very good and they do it right away. It's how you get boys to be friends. Girls don't that girls don't make friends that way. Girls have to make friends over a period of time through experience. You have to talk shit about some other girl. That's why we, that's why. Yeah. That's why when you, that's exactly right. That's why when you adopt a child, if she's a girl and she's a little older and you put her in a new scroll, she has a much harder time making friends and the boy does when he's just, you know around when you call, you can just put it, yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:23:41       When you, when he's around fucking balls. Boys make friends with boys quicker than probably girls can make friends with girls. I wouldn't think that though because girls are friendlier. No, but boys try to beat your ass when you move into town. But, but, but the point, but I think the reason that the reason that somebody gets beaten up when they show up with all this decoration is because you can't go hunting with somebody with jewelry on. It makes too much fucking noise. And he's walking around with his bangles. I clang, clang and I fucking deer are gone. If you're shiny and you got glitter on, why don't guys wear glitter and Shiny Shit? Why not? Well, what if he's shirt and a bow tie and skinny jeans? I want to beat him. I, and that's pretty sleek for the woods. I think that might also be this, that and that.

Speaker 1:          01:24:17       It might also be you're, you're trying to get the girls, you're not working with us. You're fucking showing off your tits and ass and you're not, you didn't get permission from US mother fucker. So like you can't walk in like the king peacock because then guys going to be like, that guy's a fucking peacock. And I guess he thinks he said, yeah, he thinks he's a tough guy cause he's showing me his muscles, which is an affront to me. You're, you're, you're, you're preening what if he's really skinny and he's got no muscles. It's like, you know, some guys are, he's fine. Like if a guy like you were as a tank top, of course it's imposing. Thank you. But uh, you know, some guys wear tank tops, like a real skinny guy, you know, like Chris Rock was a tank top, you know, it's not school.

Speaker 1:          01:24:52       I don't think that's the guy that gets beaten up at tomorrow. Then the guy that wears a tank top is, and he's all rocked out and he walks in. There are a lot, there are a lot of guys like do that with man when he's got a couple of drinks. I'm sure man, I'd be like, Hey, this guy, you know what, I'm gonna start with that. Who would just hold onto you for 15 seconds until you're out of breath. That's all it would take for. Especially for some juice head. Oh, you just gotta hang on, it's a ride and you've got a 15 second ride and at the end of that ride and then he can't push. Funny Man. I remember my buddy Bob Williams, that awesome. That is strong man who's a fucking maniac and he's so fucking strong. He so weird. Strong. And he'd always go up to the guys and, and, and colts and he'd be like, what's up Beatles?

Speaker 1:          01:25:29       How you doing? God be like, excuse me. Yeah. Ah, needles, needles, calling needles, God. And he just wanted a little, just a little like, you know, let me just squeeze you until he was a wrestler, right. Since he was seven with a chimpanzee. I call him the human chimp. He, uh, had one of the best lines ever. Tell the story about the guy who was fucking with him while he was surfing. Yeah, he's the best. He's on it. He's on a surfboard and his buddies with him and, and he's fucking dudes come up these local, these Amalga locals would like tattoos on the neck, rough guys. And they look at Bob and they go, hey bro, get the fuck off our wave right now. And Bob Goes, why? He does this thing where he have to know him. He's got to kind of an eye loose.

Speaker 4:          01:26:04       She's like, Eh. And, and he looks like JFK jr has got like the really thick hair and his eyes like a real good looking guy. And they go get the fuck off, get the fuck off. Our wave will kick your fucking ass. And so Bob, you gotta know, he's like really loose. He never gets afraid of it. And he goes like this. He goes, Eh, Eh, how long can you hold your breath? And the guy goes, what? He goes, how long can you hold your breath? Because I can hold my breath for over four minutes so I could jump off this board. I grab you by the hair, I bring you to the bottom. We take a little nap and you just fucking die. And then I come for you. And they were like, oh, fuck this battle. And he's got these huge hands and when he takes his shirt off, you can't really do anything about that either.

Speaker 4:          01:26:47       If they couldn't help him, oh dude, they would have to pull him off. They would be underwater. There was his eyes. Now you look into his eyes, it's like they had a great white siting out in Malibu and he's like, I'm going surfing and go, dude, there they have the great white was is out there. They had a ceiling. It's mouth. He's like, shut the fuck up. I punch a great white and his fucking face. He, he literally see, he's like, they won't eat me. I go, what do you mean the one of, they smell it on me. They're not going to a fuck. Says, well that's, that's a good way to lose your life. I know he's a fucking maniac. Wasn't the spawn a great white and Malibu's ever recently? Oh yeah, that there was a great way to 200 feet off the shore with a seal in its mouth.

Speaker 4:          01:27:21       Holy Shit. It was like Holy Shit. And the, and the fucking shark expert was like, ah, hey guys, they've always been out there. They're always swimming under you. That's their breeding ground. They eat seal there. They're there all the fucking time. So all you guys think there are no sharks in that water. There are great whites swimming under you all the time, but you're just not food to them. They'd rather read a seal. Oh, you're so lucky you're talking David Blaine. David Blaine came to my house and he and I said, he want, he wanted to cross the ocean in a bottle. Oh Shit. I hope. Fuck David. Sorry if I, I don't think he'd do it anyway. He didn't this merge. You want to do this? He's standing on literally ever. Literally he wanted to do that. He wanted to go. So he's into these and so he goes, um, but, but, but I, I said, aren't you afraid a shark too?

Speaker 4:          01:28:04       They were talking about how whales, Orcas, if you're in a glass boats on myself, crash the wit and they don't know why wo and a guy died that way. So, so he was like, yeah, that's a problem. And I said, aren't you afraid of sharks? I great whites. And he goes, Oh, you didn't see my video? I go, no. He goes, Oh dude, I'm not afraid in them at all. So what on his iPhone he's got, he's in a tough fuck. I don't know if I can say this though, because it might say it. Fuck them. Fuck David Blaine. Nice. My wouldn't hold on it. No, cause I don't want to screw up as special, but listen, you don't want to screw up this youtube Ustream show was 2000 people. Well, yeah, yeah. You fuckers anywhere else in 659 I gotta I gotta get permission from anyway, the point is he, he's, he's swimming with great whites. Uh, and, uh, all I can say, I don't want to ruin anything, but he's basically without any protection at all, slowing his heart rate down and just in the middle of the ocean with a weight belt on flow, no oxygen, no nothing holding his breath while huge, great whites go by him and all he can see his shadows. What?

Speaker 1:          01:29:02       Yeah, that's David Blaine. He's not, it's not magical though. No, it's not, not magical. He's, he's, yeah, he's, he's, I think he's very fascinating in that he's made this living, doing these endurance things and he's, you know why he's always been David. His mother was, um, was, uh, Jewish and, and uh, and so he was always obsessed with the Holocaust, but also his mother died very, very painfully and slowly of cancer. And I, when I met him, she was going through this terrible time and it was very hard for him. And he always, he became obsessed with suffering and with, with how to suffer with dignity, how to overcome, in my opinion. I'm speaking for him, but we've talked a little bit about it, but David's read so much about the Holocaust and so much about, you know, a man's search for meaning by Viktor Frankl and those kinds of guys.

Speaker 1:          01:29:48       He, he's obsessed with the notion of how one deals with all the suffering in the world. He's got a huge heart that's so is his fascination, has led him into dealing with adverse situations like really bizarre situation standing in that ice cube, remembering names, you know, he broke the world record for holding his breath. That's true. He did a Ted lecture on it. He goes, you know, he's trying to figure out a way to do the trick. We held his breath and he goes, the craziest thing is if I actually did it and he fucking did it, it's held his breath on Oprah for 17 minutes, but 17 fucking minutes. He's got a record. 17 minutes, 17 minutes. He really didn't heard of that before. That was about [inaudible] seven he can slow the heart rate down. He's amazing. Holy. That is no joke. I can't believe you don't know him.

Speaker 1:          01:30:30       He's a very special guy. I always thought that he edited his magic shit like Angel, let me tell you something. He, he's, he's so far from Chris Angel. It's crazy. Yeah. Chris Angels, angels and some big silly face. David David's been offered more money than you can fucking imagined to do shit and he just won't do it. When he did that thing for target, he, he didn't, he wasn't, he was like making no money for his magic tricks cause you wouldn't anybody sponsor him. And, and so when he did that thing for target, he said, I'll do this, but you guys have to, I'll do this magic. Do you want us to sponsor me? But for getting money from me, you guys have to, I want you to do, you got to let really poor children have a total shopping spree and you're in all your stores. So he's like a really, he's really somebody who cares.

Speaker 1:          01:31:10       I've got a lot. And it gets, why do so many people hate him because they don't know him because he's a, he's a stud. And because the same reason people just don't think people hate David Blaine. I think people hate me for Saint Joe. No, I hate Chris Angel. Definitely. Hey Chris Angel as well. Um, because because they probably that people don't like to be fooled people, no food. There's no fooling them though because he's just doing these endurance stunts. He's a weird guy in that he's don't known as David Blaine the magician, but everything he does is just like this weird physical feat. He's like a Houdini type character. When I was, when I knew him when he was 17 he was obsessed with it and he just thought [inaudible] he's always been obsessed with it. But it's kind of a shame that he's a magician because you know, they are like world events when he does something nutty.

Speaker 1:          01:31:54       I mean it really is. Like it or not, they are world events, you know, like what did he do in London where we lived on a platform or some shit. What the fuck did you do in a box spinning in a bridge. But he's always been obsessed with this notion that how can I deal with, if you put me shave my head and throw me in a corner, it was a bowl of grill in a concentration camp. How can I suffer with dignity? How would I be the best suffer? How would I deal with that? And what did he do to

Speaker 3:          01:32:19       bathroom when he was up in that box?

Speaker 1:          01:32:23       Well, first of all, he was, he was drinking and eating very little, but I'm, I think he went, he had a thing that he would go to the bathroom and I guess, I don't know. I got a bucket. Yeah, you have to do. And everybody's asleep. Yeah. I guess you're only out a PK. So hobbit, although it was a clear plastic box and he was just sitting there.

Speaker 3:          01:32:38       There should be some youtube video of him pooping. Then if I remember, I, I think they did. They put it off. I think they put like a towel around it at when he had to go to the bathroom. Right, right. If I remember, that's how they did it. How long was he in that box for? I Dunno. Like 18 days. Have you ever been to the Magic Castle? Never. I have one. I've got a friend when he liked did Jujitsu with two is a magician. Really? Yeah. Yeah. He's always inviting me. But you got to wear a jacket. You do. I know. I want to go get out of here. What your stupid fucking outfit I have to wear. That's he seems so dorky. Why can't I just wear a nice shirt? I have to wear a jacket.

Speaker 1:          01:33:12       I liked it. I liked the way you wear it for the UFC. You. I was just kind of put on a black shirt.

Speaker 3:          01:33:16       Friction plays me to wear their shirts or were a black affliction shirt every time, but then it flicks and right now this one. Yeah. This is Jujitsu, my friend grace. Grace. This is the Godfather. I don't know.

Speaker 1:          01:33:29       Yeah, probably. You need some Jujitsu in your life, doesn't he? No. I really do. As a man is screaming out for Jujitsu. This price, you got to do a little rolling you, but you got to actually kind of built for it. You've got some shoulders aren't, it? Doesn't want to do it. It's not that guy. You're that guy though, aren't you? Yes, I miss Roslyn. Why don't you go back in? I'm going, you got a bad concussion, right? Tell that story. That's a pretty crazy story. I just had this war with his kid, Pascal and booboo. Manzini was watching me and I wasn't going to give up. And we wrestled at a street sports and not the magnet school, which is a great school and he's a great guy. And uh, and we rolled and rolled and rolled. I was probably the 40 minutes and I just, nobody won.

Speaker 1:          01:34:02       It was like coat to withdraw the next day. I felt like my hands, like they would, they, I felt like I was holding a hot snow ball in my hands and I couldn't see very well. It was all things where I just, I just was, my perception was all messed up. And uh, I went to the doctor and they did it like a cat scan. So having the guy said you just got commutes, got a concussion. But for, for about six months after that I would have these weird sensations in my hands because I neurologically did something cause I'd hit my head, I was in such a f it was such a fight, you know, you don't want to lose and you go a little too crazy and uh, concussions are scary things, man. People take that shit real lightly. Um, you know, I have friends, like I've got a friend who got hit in the head by a golf ball.

Speaker 1:          01:34:41       He said he was not the same person for six months. No, I've been, I got in college, I got kicked by four guys on the ground and uh, and I remember just being truly cloudy for five days. I just, it was just so cloudy. I just got my head kicked and I was in the library. May Have you ever had that done to you? Man? It's really weird cause it's exactly what you must have, what your sock feels like in a dryer. I was just getting, I couldn't do anything. You know about Bill Roman. I'll ski. The football player had over 20 concussions and he created a bunch of brain supplements he created. He's got this stuff called neuro one I've taken it before. It's pretty fucking strong shit. It's really good like for concentration and showing that, you know, it's just, it's basically caffeine and a bunch of different brains.

Speaker 1:          01:35:22       Stimulants. But I mean this guy has a, I'm going to ask you, it was a monster man when he's tried very hard to try to kind of balance out all the impacts that he's had. He really tough to have that kind of trauma, concussions because it creates, it creates pugilistic dementia mean those guys all their brain shrink and yeah, that's something, I mean it's amazing that just realizing this over the last few decades too, you know, I mean everybody knew that football players got beat up and nobody ever like Kinda put ball is so beyond rough three rate as a hundred percent it's not 95 it's 100% you play with pain in the NFL. That's why people talk about this guy is really tough. This, they're great athletes. Play football, go run out and run it. Run a fucking uh, uh, football back in the NFL. Good luck. Yeah, those are the super athletes, man.

Speaker 1:          01:36:04       Those are the elite of the elite weeks. What's really crazy is that I've read that something, some ridiculous number like after two years of retirement, 80% of NFL players filed for bankruptcy and 60% of NBA talking about that last time, how fucking five years of leaving the NBA and the NFL, 60% of football players file file for bankruptcy because nobody's there to tell him, hey dude, you know, football is different. Don't spend your money. Nobody's ever told them that and the fact that they had been compromised by all these impacts, it's got to make them more impulsive. Effector judgment affect how they behave already dealing with a high testosterone, fun, love and Kinda rough forward tilted group. And these guys, these guys are the wolves. They're the Alpha dogs. They come in and everybody else is a fucking hen. What those guys did you ever see like a team of real football players come in here like savages?

Speaker 1:          01:36:56       It's like being in night when I was in Afghanistan and I just got caught. But guys who walked by me with beards and long hair and he's, I was like, Oh, who are those guys? Oh they're really muscular guys. The the guys, the guys who are not saying anything with no badges. That's the dark side. That's who that is. Oh. I was like, oh, those are the real elites. That's why I smell gun metal and death on him. And I was like, oh no, just the delta guys that was real elite and like seal team six, you know whoever they were and they weren't talking to me. Yeah. What a, what a strange way to go and live your life to commit to being one of the most disciplined, hardened, well-trained, fighting, killing machines in the world. My buddy hangs with those guys in Afghanistan and he works with them and he said, I said, what delineates had delta force guy from like a regular, you know, like a seal team or regular guy.

Speaker 1:          01:37:45       And he said they're exact. And I was like, what do you mean? He goes, they're just exact. They're uh, they're amazing shots. They're good at everything, but they're just really good at everything. Like, exactly. Well rounded. Like there's a place for everybody in this world and there's a, there's a place for someone to be a guy who makes pottery and is a place for Picasso and there's a place for fucking killers, man. I mean, as long as we're allowing war as war seems to be legal, the president seemed to, I believe, celebrate that we had just murdered a bad guy. I mean, that's what the whole Osama bin Ladin thing is. What they came in, the guy shot him above the eye and then took a picture and sent a fee. If send it back to their computer to facial recognition program. Ready? Your girls coming at me in the leg and get out of the way like that in head in case you got to suicide.

Speaker 1:          01:38:31       Ah Ha. Let me take out my Polaroid chicken and I'm going to just facts. Let me scan this and send it back to the White House. He ain't got the guy's face. Let's take this picture. Let's run it through the facial recognition there. Yeah, it's an it's amps. Do a hundred percent believe this story though. Yes. I do know why there were 17 people involved. I have to pay 70. Uh, yeah, 70 dog. So good luck trying to cover that up. And then the one time watching Greg About Jessica Lynch where they've tried to pretend there was a gun shootout and she was actually just in the hospital. Go make your PP, Bro. We're going to talk about Pat Tillman to conspiracies. Brian's not buying them. Brian is my, uh,

Speaker 3:          01:39:07       most Fox News like friend. Did you see the new footage of I think with the World Trade Center, uh, footage. Oh yeah, I did see from the one reporter's perspective that show it's a completely different, I mean that shit looked like eight, which is sitting there fucking melting like the building that building or seven noises. It was amazing. Totally, totally. It did. Look, I've always said that that tower seven looks ridiculous. It looks like a controlled demolition, but the fuck do I know. I'm not an engineer. It might've looked like controlled demolition just because of the very bizarre way in which it was injured that it was injured on the bottom floors. And that's what gave him first and everything pancaked down. Very possible. The fuck do I know, but it does look like a controlled demolition. But that video is, what I thought was most fascinating was all the buildings are the cars outside that had been blown up and on fire. Like I didn't realize that that had happened. I kind of like thought that of course everything fell and collapsed, but I thought there was probably like just this massive pile of debris. I didn't realize that all these cars were like had been lit on fire and fuel and everything just kind of fell down into the street. I wouldn't want to, yeah, that's what the airplane, Hey, it just fucking fire. And Brian comes back. He's got a crazy fucking story of his buddy that was a actual, um, uh, uh, Wall Street.

Speaker 1:          01:40:22       He was a stockbroker and he was there while it all happened and he heard sounds that sound like car accidents, just Bam, Bam. And then he realized, tell the story about your friend who, uh, had heard those sounds. He was at September 11th, heard those sounds, that sounded like car accidents and then realize what they were. That's what there was this, in fact, there's a documentary that captured it by the way. But yeah, he, he uh, he just started hearing like these goosh she was like two cars ramming and Jewish. So there's 40 miles an hour or 50 miles an hour. And uh, it was, it turned out it was the bodies hitting, uh, hitting the pavement, hitting the ground. How many people do you think jumped? They don't really, I, they probably have that figure, but a lot because what happened was it got so hot and rather than burns you, you jumped in and some people held hands.

Speaker 1:          01:41:11       Some people form groups and saw that. I saw that. Holy Shit. What a way to go home. The way to go, man, it's a quick, it's a, yeah. I don't know your phone time. God damn the has to be horrifying. Yeah. I'm afraid of heights. So, uh, I, I perish. And it's saw saying you're afraid of heights that is beyond the afraid of heights. Well, you know, that's a good story. It's like a, you know, Jay Burke knows Jimmy Burke knows a certain, somebody who's who's, who was terrified of flying, she was seeing a therapist for it and she finally worked up the courage to get on a plane and fly. And uh, the plane broken half in the middle of the air, it broken half on takeoff. So she, she fell backwards in a, in a half a plane and you probably alive for a little while.

Speaker 1:          01:41:57       When you're playing brain breaks in half, that's not fun. That's a, that's, that's a, that's a you. The secret is real. And she manifested done. Man. I know. Or maybe she was a psychic and she predicted her own demise. She knew her timeline was tryna raises a question, what's, what, what's the way you'd want to die? Uh, I'd want to die with a mask on in an orgy. I'm glad you brought that up because a, it's reminds me of a story. I experienced a story that Brian was telling me yesterday that it was so good. I said, stop talking, stop talking, and told me this tomorrow. Well, you know, low can't tell the names involved. I can't tell the names. There was a celebrity of them all, but it's a very significant celebrity. When we were growing up, this celebrity was a big star. Yes. And, and uh, I'll tell you it to say whether or not they were a part of no, we cannot, we cannot say anything else.

Speaker 1:          01:42:51       Telly Savalas no, no, no. But, um, but, uh, the handsome young men, can you say a music star? A movie still not allowed to say. And anybody who was a celebrity, he was a celebrity, let's put it that way. And, and um, and the reason I don't only say things because, you know, it was a private thing. I mean, I admire the guy. Actually, I half are doing what he did, but I'm used to tell us what happened. Well, you know, in life, I was just many, many moons ago, many moons ago, many, many moons ago, uh, at least I think six years ago or something. And I was single. Um, and I, I, uh, there are things certain guys want to do, you know, you want to like, I always say this, you go, you want to stop a crime? Do you want to kill somebody with a sword? You want to fucking, you know, uh, uh, and then you want to bang six girls at the same time. I mean, that's, that's one of my goals. Six. Well, I'm driving a penis. Do you have, and I do. Well, and I'll show you, I'll show you after the story. Uh, but I, I'm, uh, I'm driving to Venice. I get a call from a girl I used to bang, who was a rig.

Speaker 4:          01:43:52       Wonderful. I mean a real Vegas pro. So, uh, she gives me a call and she goes, what are you doing? And I go, I driving to Venice. She goes, she goes, get your ass up to this hotel. And it was, it was, let's just call it the shirt. And she was getting your ass to the Sheraton right now we got, we got six girls and only two Cox. We need you now. So I'm like, ah. I'm like, Nah, I can't, I fucking, I got an audition for Sydney Pollack the next day, which I did. Right. And I'm like, I need some Paul's brother. Yes it is. Yes. The painter and I go, I can't, I gotta go. I gotta go to fucking the, I can't do it. That's probably, yeah, I can't, you know what I'm going on my way to now. All you, the only thing you can do in that situation is just faint.

Speaker 4:          01:44:35       Otherwise, just a faint, faint Bica or, or die there or pull over and sleep and wake up in the morning because any other movement is going to bring you toward six hot girls. Cause I knew the kind of grocery hot with, um, now I'm going, you mean there's a fucking, there's fucking en suite and the Sharon, will you tell the story before you even go any further? You decided to tell this story recently at the UCB I told the story at the UCB podcast and it was interesting because they're all a very nice group and very funny and talented group of people, but they are, um, they're not, they probably not live the kind of sexual deviancy that I have gone through, you know? And so I just feel that they just seem like wholesome good people, you know, that don't have just this deep dark matter living inside there.

Speaker 4:          01:45:22       And so I got up and told this story that I'm about to tell you guys about essentially my experience in a fucking orgy. Uh, and then what made you want to tell this? I just, I, I fucking want to tell the truth about who I really am. I just felt like I just felt like going up and going, and he's a really cute story. Stories you guys. Uh, now let me tell you what, I'll fucking deviant. I really am. You know, when you didn't think there were cute stories. I mean, I didn't really, I didn't listen that hard, but, but I know that people involved, they're funny. I mean in law, but cycling Moisha this, the standard Kong Moishe's funniest shit. He's funny. He's got a great sense of humor and the other guys, I haven't seen a lot of their work, but it used to be, puts out some pretty bad ass comics.

Speaker 4:          01:46:03       I mean, it's funny, funny fucking people like Amy Poehler came out of there and you know, great people. And so they're telling their stories and for whatever reason you decided to take it down per lane. That's all. Tell a story that you never even told me. I've never told anybody because you know, I mean, it's just, it's just like, I was like, I want to tell something that's a little outrageous because I don't want any secrets in my fucking life. I just want to, I just want to be fucking out there and I don't give a fuck. I don't care what really care what other people think. I care what my friends think. You know, and my friends all know exactly who the fuck I am. All my friends know who I was. So much freedom in that. But there's always freedom and that I can't, I'm not good at keeping lot of facade up.

Speaker 4:          01:46:38       So I tell this story. So, so I'm driving and I go, I hang on my first impulse, I can't do what I can do it now. I had listened, there was this thing where I'm, you might've told me Joel, but we were talking about a woman who was dying of cancer. And they said, if you could do it all over again, what would you do? And she said, I, I wouldn't do anything because it made sense. And I am, I was thinking about that when I got this phone call. I was thinking, you know, I want to, I want to do, you know, you gotta leave your life sometimes and you've got to have experiences and you've got to fucking do something that kind of shocked and astonished as yourself. And by the way, you don't know a guy out there who wouldn't want to fuck six girls at the same time.

Speaker 4:          01:47:13       So I hear that. But I'm driving and I, my first time, Nah, I gotta go get it. I've got to study my audition. I got an audition tomorrow, but now I'm thinking only fuck these girls. You know what I'll do? I'm going to drive. If I see a seven 11 I'll stop and get condoms. It doesn't mean I'm going there. I'm not trying to grab my, but I'm going to stop and maybe if I got another call, no good. Some other, oh look, a seven 11 or I'm going to pull off, but I'm definitely not going in this chair it and there's no way I blah blah. And I go, Oh, you guys don't have any condoms. Buy Condoms. Phone rings again. Where the fuck are you? So while this is going on, you're basically like a junkie that someone's saying, come on, let's do some blow.

Speaker 4:          01:47:46       I'm not basically like a junkie. I am a junkie. All right. There's no it is. But that feeling when you're about to do something really deviant is junky. Junky my heart. My Heart's beating fast and I'm getting, and I can get it out of my mind. I keep going back to it. I keep trying to put it out of my mind and I'm losing. And Matt, I'm losing the battle. I'm getting pulled under. They're adding more and more weight and I'm trying to keep up. I got my, I'm like, okay, I can't go under water. I keep doing this. I'm treading water, but they're just adding weights to my legs with the imagery. I'm thinking about these girls. Long story short, I go, fuck it. I find myself at the Sheraton. I go up to the suite, I get met at the door by my girl.

Speaker 4:          01:48:24       She's wearing a mask. She gives me a porcelain doll mask to put on. So I go, oh. And then she gives me a strip of paper with the rules of the game, which is that this is a birthday girl and my, um, and I am fucking, uh, the only rule is I can't hit or spit. I'm like, okay. I wasn't planning on hitting and spitting these girls. I'm going to fuck them. Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, whoa. Is this stuff written down? [inaudible] printed is written, typed. Very Neat Strip of paper. Wow. So this is well organized. So everyone has a sheet. I walk in, I walk in and I go and I see fucking four of the hottest girls I've ever seen. One girl was getting banged on the bed by some muscular dude and then there's a dude who's kind of just standing off to the side not doing anything with like a shaved jazz.

Speaker 4:          01:49:14       And I'm like, I don't like that guy. He's weird. He's getting fucking looks all bloated. He's just like been lifting a lot of ways and never did a sport in his life. I'm like, whatever. Shaved chests, orange is orange, orange, the shape and some weird mask. I was like, all right. Then I look at myself, everyone's naked dude. Yeah. And guess what? She goes, you got to take her clothes off right now. You'd have to get no, no clothes. So she starts peeling my pants off. She gets on her knees and starts to work me. And as I'm getting work by my, my old girlfriend, I got this porcelain doll mascot. I look in the mirror and I look at my fucking dumb ass and I go, ah, there's the first off. Literally not on my Dick is getting sucked. I go, that's weird. My fucking dog Maskus is what is my legs?

Speaker 4:          01:49:49       I've got to start tanning. That's gross. I'm like, I'm fucking gross. And it's one girl goes, yeah, you, you at the white skin and that doll masking a hard on. That's not creepy. I'm like, oh, Yay, whatever. So this, this really hot girl who turns out to be the birthday girl who happens to be the celebrities wife, she gets down on her knees and I get pushed over to her and now I'm getting worked by her. But the thing is, she's really fucking good at it. And I go, um, I'm going to go, I'm not a porn star. I when a girl is hot as mommy with a mask on and I'm totally anonymous with a mask on my face, I'm fucking going to come. And plus I got to come cause I got an audition tomorrow, so I want it now. So I'm like, oh.

Speaker 4:          01:50:35       And I go, I'm going to fuck you, keep doing it. I'm going to come and the guy and I hear you're to come. And I look over and it's a guy, I'm like, I think I recognize that guy. I know him from somewhere, but whatever. He goes whole lot shoe and a video camera comes out and it's right on the girl. And I'm like, Oh really? All right. I guess this was like the Duke Porn. Woo. My knees lock up and who, which by the way, I never locked their mouth or face where in her mouth. My friends and the husband is filming this. He films that and uh, yeah. And then I hope I don't ever have to do a Disney show cause I'm fucking fucked. This is all fiction is, is all fiction. But this is, this is part of the, this is part of my fictional story that I'm doing on stage one man show.

Speaker 4:          01:51:20       Yes. Okay. Yeah. So now, now, um, now I, uh, by the way, I'm speaking, this actually happened to a friend and I'm speaking and telling you, I'm telling the story. How can we got enough disclaimers? Yeah, just tell her like three of them that has happened to my friend and, and so, uh, so now I go, oh shit. I just lost it. Good. I can get the fuck out of here. Cause this is a freak show and I don't belong here. And I, you know, I got an orange guy in the corner with, I have a hard on and another dude banging on a grill on a bed. And I got, I got, I mean, I'm like, I get it the fuck Outta here, but you know what? I had an experience. I'm going to go and I can go make my Sydney Pollack, uh, audition. So I'm putting on my pants and I'm about to leave. I'm sneaking out and all of a sudden this 10 with a mass comes up and she goes, you're not going to fuck me.

Speaker 6:          01:52:04       And I go, uh, oh.

Speaker 4:          01:52:07       I mean, I, I was going to go, I have a d and I would almost say it, I'll just buy it. Even know I was mad at her. I'm like, she goes, you're not gonna find me. And she turns around and I go, I mean, I don't want to be rude. Maybe I should fuck you. So next thing I know my pants are coming off and you know, that's it now. Now, now I'm in the belly of the beast now and I'm just seeing fucking read and I'm just going crazy. I login and they're like, hey, this guy's out rate. I was appalling. I was appalling. My energy level noises, I gave it up. I, at this point, I'm like, I'm fucking gone. Now know on the other people grunting or is everyone kind of road? They were kind of done second, I'm going in for, and everybody else quit.

Speaker 4:          01:52:46       They kind of quit. And then that athletic, lucky not to be a dick, but my, my dig was the mover then weren't doing so well. So I'm just fucking going crazy. I'm like, this is, look at this shit. I, we're really Argo. And, Oh yeah, I'll switch. Oh, why not? Hey, free country, whatever. Fuck you America. And I'm going nuts. And now I fucking get to a point where, um, uh, uh, I'm, I'm now the girl who's the burden girl goes, I want some of this. And she says, don't use him up to the girl that I'm going crazy on. She pushes, she, she pushes me down on the bed. She gets on top of me. So as I'm being taken care of by this beautiful girl, now I'm being worked on my back and trying my hardest not to lose it. Um, cause she's so beautiful.

Speaker 4:          01:53:34       And so, uh, uh, all of a sudden at this point, the celebrity who now I now recognize cause he's drunk and the mask is crooked on his face. So it's like, I'm like, bye. See your face. All right. Well they are and they don't. And he goes, I want to get home and get it. Let me get, let me, let me get you, you know, he wants a sandwich or he wants to go in, in south. So he wants to, why she's on top of you. He wants us to get in around. Yes. Oh, she turns to him cause she calls the whole thing's a disaster, right. So she looks back and she goes, she says to him, she goes, um, something like, you know, like she does this, like the silent kind of like language. Like, no, I don't want to do that right now too.

Speaker 4:          01:54:12       He's like, come on [inaudible] and there's a debate going on. So finally she hits back to me and we, by the way, we're connected. We're connected. We're making love at this point. Okay. Yeah. Yours, your Dick's in her vagina and his Dick in her butt hole. He tries, but he can't get it. And many times it is Dick touch yours. Never if you did. And if it did, it doesn't matter because I wouldn't have felt that anyway. I don't care. I'm not squeamish there. I said it really well. I don't know. I'm, I'm doing all this girl, this girl. Well, okay, so he's got a fungus on his balls. I'll do that. I don't know. I wasn't even thinking, dude. I was just like, this is, this is an experience I'm already done. I'm already fucked. So, so he can't get in. And, and she, and he goes, ah.

Speaker 4:          01:54:54       He goes, oh, what the fuck are kicking in? And she turns around and goes, what the, don't fucking play me. I told you I didn't want to do it. And they started having a fight about not being able to get an harass as I'm having sex with her and they're having a fight. And I'm thinking to myself, I look back and like, that's, this is the beginning of the end and this relationship, this is a weird thing to have a fight about it. There's another issue like that, you know, you're fucking Nigga, that's her, whatever. I get that, but are swingers. So, so he can't get in. They have this fight and then he kind of storms off and she kind of goes back to me and we do our thing. And so, uh, so now I can't believe this is like the most popular podcasts.

Speaker 4:          01:55:31       Now. There goes my reputation by the way. And so now, uh, it comes time for me to, she wants me to finish off in a porn fashion, which would be again in her mouth. And so I go, okay, and so now we're going to do the whole money shot thing. And I just, it's been a long time and I just lose it, you know, right away again. And as I'm, you know, coming, uh, I, I see Mr Celebi come running around with the camera and he calls me and he goes, oh, what the fuck? Hey, why'd you let him call him so fast? I wanted to film it. And she goes, what am I supposed to stick my dick in his fucking up the stick my finger in his dick. Don't be an asshole. I don't have any control of it. And they now they get an argument about that. And as their argument, I'm like, I go, all right, thank you so much. I throw all my fucking man. I run the fuck out of there. And by the way, then they got divorced. Have you ever seen that guy since then? Oh No. That would came to mind. My lucky guess. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. I gotta I gotta I gotta save some anyway. I wasn't there. By the way. That story that doesn't belong to me. That's a, that's a friend of mine story. But I was new stream.

Speaker 3:          01:56:39       His apparently died be noticed what happened. Is it us? No, it's not us. It's the yesterday cause cause my old ninth, the people in the tribe is it just Ustream crashed. Yeah. Sorry. Well we're still broadcasting. Yes. You have to download it from my team and sung the end part. The best part. So, um, you've never had a situation like this ever again. This was one of those stories that you hear about. Like that's like a Hollywood story I've had. I've had those experiences. How many? More than one? Yeah. How many times have you had been in the same room with another guy? With a girl? How many times?

Speaker 4:          01:57:13       I mean, I mean I don't want to get too detailed, but when I was single in La and I'm on and, and you know, with, with a house and no worries. And that was a young guy. Why I did that kind of stuff all the time. I mean, I didn't have, I didn't, I wasn't a swinger. I didn't go to orgies. I didn't organize anything. But I've, I was pretty good at getting, I think my friends would tell I was pretty good at getting a group of great openminded girls together and hogging off.

Speaker 3:          01:57:40       Funny thing to talk about though, isn't it? It's a funny thing to talk about because when you, when you start saying, you know, banged all these girls, I bang this girl by now you open yourself up to people

Speaker 4:          01:57:49       getting angry. I don't care. I know you don't. I know you don't. I don't, I don't because, because I do anything wrong. I didn't do anything wrong and, and I, and I would do it again and I had a blast. I have fucking blast. And it's true. And it turned me on. Is that turned me on. You want to turn me on you, you know, you throw a bunch of like six really cool girls in a room and they're all like, we want to fuck you. Uh, I, that turns me on. Yeah, it turns me off. Gets me going. Sorry. But no, it's a cry. But yeah, I'm down. Isn't it funny? Yeah

Speaker 3:          01:58:17       though, that you, you think about this like the way people describe it, like this is a fucked up thing to talk about.

Speaker 4:          01:58:23       Yeah. But that's what's interesting. Yeah. It's taboo because I, when I was telling the story of UCB, it was actually kind of an experiment. I was like, I want to see what happens to this audience when I tell a real story about something that most people would never admit to because it makes you look to a lot of people bad. It may or it makes you look like a pervert or anything, but I don't believe in that shit. I don't buy it. And, and um, anybody knows me knows. I'm just not hung up on that stuff. I'm really not. And uh, uh, and I wouldn't change that experience for the fucking world. What's that guy's name? Vincent Gallo as what his name is he the one that did that movie brown butter. We're Chloe and she still has a career and she blew him in the movie the movie.

Speaker 4:          01:59:00       And in the scene, she actually sucks his dick and he kept, you know, I notice about, especially women when, uh, what I notice about, um, I told that story and I were a lot of women in the UCB. Women were really open when women were really like, found. Like I had a couple women say hi. I found that story really honest and refreshing. And, and, and how do you end it? What do you say he received? The theme was it was a slippery slope once you, like if somebody calls you about an orgy, if you don't turn around and drive home immediately and throw handcuffs on yourself, anything else is a slippery slope and you're going down that slope. If you're a guy like me. So you got to fucking, you know, and that's, and, and you know that story about getting a call like that is what a lot of us deal with on a day to day basis with our addictions.

Speaker 4:          01:59:44       Whether it's, I'm trying to stop smoking, I'm trying to stop drinking, I'm trying to stop fucking watching porn all day. Whatever it is. People have these addictions trying to stop meth. I'm trying to stop heroin. These, it's the same addiction, man. It's the same. It's the same impulse. And, and so just to suggest that I don't have some of that in me and that I in the past haven't acted on, that is dishonest. And by the way, his concern is suggesting I'm not human. Fuck you. If you've got a judgment on that. I, I thought it was awesome. And you know, and that's how it is. What do you think makes that impulse? What is it? It W I know exactly the legendary purposes. It's, I know exactly what I think it is. I think that that kind of behavior I heavier ultimately does two things.

Speaker 4:          02:00:26       A couple of things. Historically it threatens, first of all, it's, it's unsafe activity, but you can actually catch a disease and you can spread it. So there's that. I mean, I use condoms and stuff, but there's this, there's this notion that you historically have you had sex with a lot of people. You came down with a shit like syphilis. And we have it, we have a historical memory of promiscuous behavior leads to really shitty diseases. That's the first thing. But I also think that a society has to have certain norms and certain rules. Um, because that was always the way you were able to be more profit, more efficient. I think when you had a credo that people bought into, they were, it was easier to organize things. It was easier to create a cohesive culture, uh, a cohesive, a belief system. And those are very human impulses and developments. And so when you have somebody who decides, I'm going to follow my appetites and I'm just going to fuck and be a real slot or a real, you know, a real dirt bag, whatever, these are the words people use, I think we all go though, all of us rightly in some ways go, well that's, that's really indulging your appetites and nobody can sustain that because actually what leads to that kind of behavior isn't necessarily anything positive. You're certainly not going to develop a right,

Speaker 1:          02:01:40       you know, you're still generally considered unsavory. It's, it's, it's base behavior. It's giving in completely to the beast and a lot of people that supported our freaks. That's right. Other fellow freaks. We're all freaks. If we weren't freaks then, then youtube and I mean red tube and, and, and all these things important wouldn't be a multibillion dollar industry. But, but you, you, you have that we have a culture that's obsessed with purity. I mean, this Anthony Wiener thing, it's obsessed with it. The guy had to resign for sending a picture of is thinly clad package to go to a coed. Wow. Wow. You know, it's very strange. But what do you think leads to what, what purpose does that addiction have in, in human beings? Why do we have that? Why does it exist? Why is there this weird thing that makes us fixate on things? I know that there's a book I read called the selfish gene.

Speaker 1:          02:02:30       I know that, that a scientist, um, I can't remember who wrote it, but I know that a scientist would, um, would suggest that genetic variation has both ends of the spectrum. So you have to sort of have, um, the need for sex is very strong in, in human beings. And I would imagine that you have examples of people who have a very strong sex drive and they're on one side of the spectrum and other people that are asexual and it just probably, you can chalk it up to hormones or whatever it might be, but I don't even necessarily mean sexual. Uh, I, I just mean why, what is this proclivity for addiction that people have for compulsive behavior for or impulsive behavior rather than male couples have an impulse maybe. Maybe. First of all, it's they're trying to fill a void, right? You're trying to feel something.

Speaker 1:          02:03:16       I think it comes down to the juice. Do you think it's because we don't live hunter gatherer lives safe? I was going to say, I was going to say that I think when you have to track down a deer and kill it and that requires extreme behavior. And in some ways I mean it, it requires adrenaline. It requires endurance, it requires a supreme aggression. You, when you kill an animal, like the, you know, we came up millennia killing animals with a spear or a boner, you smell that blood, you have to skin it, you're involved in that animal's life. And I, I would imagine that the activity of hunting on that level it takes, it's a huge rush. It's why people get addicted to war. So you think there's like some sort of a gap and then there the average person working a nine to five existence with some sort of stayed behavior pattern that they have to follow throughout the day that these people have like a hole that needs to be filled?

Speaker 1:          02:04:08       No, the porn comes in or drugs come in or there's no guessing come in. Yeah, that's what he does because we have a lot of needs. And I think one is, and by the way, I'll tell you what needed probably fills. We have needs. We have a need for certain certainty. We have a need to feel like I know where my paychecks coming. I got a room full of men. I think we have a need to connect with people, you know. But we also have a need a lot of that behavior. When you gamble, look at it. When you, when you show up in a room and six girls you've never met are there to fuck you or that you don't even know what they look like and your heart's

Speaker 4:          02:04:38       beating. You know what? You're really responding to adventure, uncertainty. The need to not know what's coming next. And human beings have a very deep need to, to put themselves into the unpredictable, just as much as they have a need to be in the predictable bit. But if you look at somebody who doesn't have anything that, that unpredictable in their lives, what happens? They get fucking bored. It's, it's why when you make all the money in the world and you've done it all, a lot of people get a sense of loss because there's no longer that feeling like, like Zoros a mountains to climb. Yeah, well, sorrows. The guy who, the rich, the multimillionaire, billionaire guy, he was a, uh, I think, I believe as a Jewish refugee and it was 15 or 13 years old. Um, uh, and hunger as a Jew, as a Jew.

Speaker 4:          02:05:21       And he was hiding from the Nazis, meaning I have to hide from the Nazis and a otherwise he was going to be killed. And, and he, he said, um, that in many ways those were the most exciting, as, as terrifying and horrible times. They were also the times he felt the most alive because he didn't know if he was going to make it till tomorrow. And, and human beings I think have a very, very deep, deep need to be put in the unpredictable. And, and, and there is, there's a way to do that that's positive and there's a way to do that that's negative. And as you get older, like I am, you start to realize that going to orgies, um, um, uh, and that kind of stuff, gambling, those are not positive. They're not necessarily positive things to do you because you pay a price for them in some ways.

Speaker 4:          02:06:03       If you become a sex addict and you're, you're chasing skirt all the time, you're going to pay a price in connection and intimacy, I believe. Yeah. Um, um, I, I've had to confront that in myself and I've had to deal with that on, on, on a personal level. And so you don't get away with anything in the world. You, you, you, and, and the best way to do it is not to be too strict with yourself, to fucking be forgiving of yourself and others to realize that we are all hanging on by a thread in one way or another. You know, I've watched really good people try to quit smoking and they can't fucking do it. You can call it, you can tell them they have weak character, but I don't choose to believe that. I believe that they're just fucking week like all of us in one area.

Speaker 4:          02:06:41       Weakness, courage, intelligence, these are all compartmentalized skills, compartmentalized virtues. Uh, nobody is, you know, very few people are sober all the way through. And if you are sober all the way through and you don't have any vices, you might be fucking too boring for me to hang out. Want to know what doctor Drew's vices are cause he know he's got them. Well, and you know, a lot of doctors though, doctors I'd noticed tend to be very sober individuals. I agree, but I wouldn't want to go home. They can doctor drew, how about that? I would tell them how it would second hand smoke funnel ticket in his brain. But when, when you see a guy who was constantly around people who are fucking up left and right, but yet he and his life is like very together, very together family that, that, that, but then that's, that's part of his, what makes him feel, but that's a positive addiction. That's, I mean doctor truth always challenged with a new person. He's going to try to help. He's trying, doctor spends his life solving problems. Cousin Nate. Yeah. Not only does he do that, but he's always on

Speaker 3:          02:07:36       the love line show as well. People don't realize he's still got that radio show. So every day, every day. It really does help people. I mean he really got us to a out and needed advice and I don't think he's helping those celebrities. I mean you can say they are, but those dudes need a paycheck. I mean, I guess any possible treatment and maybe maybe the idea of shocking them and putting it into the public law actually. Yeah. Maybe putting him in the public eye actually puts more pressure on them and it actually makes it more real. I'm fascinated with, with this notion of what discipline really means and what, what self restriction really comes down and you know, what, what impulsiveness is worth and how much is dynamic, crazy, unpredictable behavior worth in a, in the dynamic of a machine. You know, because the human being, you look, look at a human being in the context of being a unit and there's, there's qualities that I appreciate and one of the qualities I like impulsive people.

Speaker 3:          02:08:27       I like wildness. No, all my friends are impulsive. All my friends are crazy. Me Too. You know, it's more, it's more color. It's fun to be around. Yeah. I mean we've talked about Jimmy Burke. Joey Diaz is a perfect example. You're a perfect example, you know, to other people. I'm an example. It's like we're all kind of the most fun people I know are all pretty fucking crazy. Yeah. You know, I mean you, you don't get interesting and funny without those weird sorta. I agree. And I like to hold onto a lot of my impulses. I like to hold onto a lot of my, whatever you would call the beast and the flesh. I mean, I do think that there's a, there's something beautiful about learning how to be in, can total control of yourself, of your appetites and everything else. I think that is a virtue and I think that's something people as adults, as you get older, should strive for.

Speaker 3:          02:09:10       Um, but I also think that I don't want to lose all my, uh, all my crates, especially as an artist, especially as in the chair, you needed to be forward to the wildest moments on stage. You're letting people know when those wildest moments like, I've been to this crazy place. That's why I'm a standup comic. I get up on stage and try to make people laugh. It's called look at me. There's a whole line I'm trying to fill in all or not. I don't want to lose that whole, I really don't. I mean, you ever see a really good actor. They're uh, they're basket cases, they're fucking basket cases. The key is to be that basket case, but to be happy. And as a comic goods, there's a dance and it is possible and it's possible to put your, your balance in the correct way so that you still are energetic and enthusiastic and creative.

Speaker 3:          02:09:52       But yet you still have that there's a part of your brain that will flip over to the dark side. You just gotta be able to control it. Well and, and you know, but, but let me tell you something, when you start talking in terms of I better learn how to control it. You know, that's not how people are. That's not how people control themselves. The minute you start saying things like, I can't do that. Not gonna do that. Like I was doing with that, with that hotel room. Right. I'm not going to go up there and fuck those six girls cause it's, it's wrong. That doesn't work for me. That's not going to work for me. Well, what does work well, I think you need a different car. You either need a different kind of philosophy. But I think more importantly when it comes to dealing with an addiction, I think you've got a substitute. I think you've got to associate, you got to figure out a way to associate that behavior with nothing positive. And, and, and you've got to be able to

Speaker 4:          02:10:33       associate a different kind of behavior with something that's more pleasurable because it was, anytime you do that and add in any addict counseling, right? They tried to get you to replace her addiction with, you know, start gardening, get obsessed with something. It's gotta be something fun. It's like when I tell people that, I know that people that don't work out okay, and I noticed that they just can't work out. And what they, what they get tired the minute you start talking about you've got to start eating better and look at them, you guys. Yeah, yeah, because you go, you got to start eating better and you've got to start working out what they think is, I got my God. That means I'm going to have to sweat in a gym and I got to know what all I want to do is show you very gently and slowly how much better you feel when you are in shape versus when you're not.

Speaker 4:          02:11:10       And once you feel the difference, you will slowly start to go to that. And when you go back to your old habits, you'll go, damn, I don't feel as good as I did. I, I gotta I gotta do something here and you'll try to get out of that state. It's the only way I think people really change. I really, I really believe that. I don't think you change with a gun to your head. I think real change happens when you, when you see and understand the difference and, and, and that that can be, that can be taken to I think movements like w like al-Qaeda's movement, that's Muslim fundamentalism. When you show them a really interesting program, uh, in, in Yemen where they take these young idealistic al Qaeda guys and they get these Muslim scholars in a room. These like really kind of like smart guys who've been around older guys and they debate them, they challenge him to a debate and they go, what are your ideas on Islam?

Speaker 4:          02:11:57       You're on Islamic fundamentalism, you love the Quran. Let's have a talk since I'm any month, I've been doing this for 50 years. What are your ideas? And they just dismantle their ideas mentally. And a lot of these guys just go, I didn't know any of that. I've been fed this kind of thing. And they're like, well this is how it is. And let me show you the examples in the Quran and all of a sudden they go and their minds change. And if you want to change what you're saying is you need to go to the Muslim religion, you'll stop beating off and fucking whores in a hotel. Well, well, well, well, well religion, whether it's Christianity, Muslim, Islam, Buddhism, Hinduism, Ken can serve that function and has for many addicts and as a really a real place for people to kind of live. They go with the 12 step program.

Speaker 4:          02:12:37       One of the reasons why it works is that you submit to a higher power. Exactly. It sounds ridiculous, but as a tool is a mental tool using it as an operating system that you, you're going to operate your mind under the confines of this Christianity. Look, man, I've 0.0 system. The biggest, the biggest thing, the biggest problem we have in some ways and, and the, the worst thing that artists can do for themselves as to say, I'm all my genius comes right out of me. It's, it takes a lot of pressure off you as a creative person or a person in general to say, you know what? I'm not perfect. I'm going to let something else guide me. I'm going to let something. Um, so if you're an artist, he's, I'm like Flannery O'connor, that wonderful thing. She goes, I don't sit at my typewriter to write at all. I just sit at my typewriter and I sit there in case something happens and it's something starts working its way through me. I'll start typing. Right? But the pressure off you cynical people will look at like Pressfield's book like the war and they'll go, well, this is poppy cock. That's fine nonsense. That's fine. But it's not effective. It is. If what people don't understand

Speaker 1:          02:13:31       it, and it may be incorrect, it may be all within the confines of your mind, but if you operate on the principle that you are enacting the muse that you were contacting the muse, then it really does work. Ken, can I, can I, can I Sinek kind of Cynak explained to me why when I hear a piece of music I start crying because it's so beautiful. Can you explain mathematically how that goes? I'm not interested at all I know is I start crying because it's beautiful. A lot of things that cannot be explained what it does, laws fires me. I hear, I hear like a beautiful piece of music. You know why I got into standup? I remember when I got to stand up after I heard your album and that Voodoo Punani song and all that stuff and I'm a seriously, and I went home that day.

Speaker 1:          02:14:09       So you don't know this. I never told you this. I'm, it's, I'm glad I'm talking about this because I listened to your album and I had to leave early. I got out of there and you couldn't, and you got mad at me. You call me, I'm gonna go. You just left without saying by just took off. You know why I took off? I couldn't handle being around you because I was so not only inspired, but I went, my friends doing something really special here and I have, I know I have something in me and I'm not living up to it. And being around him has reminded me of, of the fact that I'm not living my fucking life. And I remember you called me real mad and I made up some excuse. Like, I was like, I started telling you like some excuse and then I went, dude, I gotta be honest with you.

Speaker 1:          02:14:45       I, you fucked me up a little bit. I said, that song and that, that your jokes were so on inspiring to me. And I went home and I started writing. And so that's what happened to me. That was a huge catalyst for me. I went home and started writing because after I heard that song and after I heard those fucking jokes, you would come to those, God damn you're judge. This was I don't know how many years ago. They were so fucking well formed. You were such a title wave. It was like an example for the first time where I went, I saw an artist, so just peak come together and just put out the power you putting out with so retarded that it was changing. It was changing the whole fucking room. People were like, what the fuck this guy's writing songs he's doing. And I remember going, I got to taste some of that.

Speaker 1:          02:15:26       I got to have some of that. I've got to get the fuck out of here. I get that stuff. That's what you need, man. And if you don't have that in your life, you've got to find it. Either surround yourself with friends who do it, go go to ted.com do what? Do whatever you have to do, man. Find it. It's out there. And the beautiful thing about the technology and this is for young people, is that you can spend your time listening to music and reading about what Lady Gaga Ward or the gym, or you can fucking open your mind to a whole world out there that is going to bite you in the ass if you're not ready for it anyway. So start opening your mind and start reading. And it's important to not give in a jealousy when you see someone doing something that you're not doing and you feel like, fuck, I'm not doing.

Speaker 1:          02:16:06       There's a, there's an instinct to protect yourself by bullshitting yourself and becoming jealous and bitter and talking shit about that person. And that's where haters come from. What haters are 100% of all haters in the world are unrealized potential. It's 100% accurate. I'm not a hater. I'm, I'm a, I'm a pretty nice guy. Easy going guy. It's because I'm successful. Well, when like Michael Jordan's not a hater, you know what I'm saying? I mean, you know what I mean? I mean like when you get to a guy at that level, they're not haters that the real haters are and they see someone doing well and it bothers them to a person like a Michael Jordan or a winner. They see someone doing well and it inspires them to take it up another notch. I've always, I've always, always tried to look at things like that. When you see something great and if it's a friend of yours, there's nothing.

Speaker 1:          02:16:51       You have to use it as inspiration. It's supposed to inspire you and haters and, and that notion is a, is is what that is, is it's a skewed perspective. I think what happens is a lot of times they say, well, you know what? There is scarcity in the world, so there's only a, there's only a certain size of the pie. And if you're doing this, you've taken up all the pie and there's no room for me. Not True Man, not at all. There is no scarcity in tangible way of thanking you, open yourself up to something beautiful and great and let that work through you and really be effective. Be astonished by it. Be scared by it. DPP be brought to your knees by it. Whatever it takes you will, you will find way more strength in that surrender to, to the beautiful. Then you will when you close yourself off.

Speaker 1:          02:17:39       And all of us, man, all of us had this notion to go, I'm closing myself off. Fuck this. Everybody wants to win the lottery, but the lottery will fucking ruin you. You have to earn the whole thing. In order to be a real man or a real woman, you have to earn the whole thing. And the crazy thing is to be the man. To get to that point, to be the man, you literally have to not ever be possibly the man because you have to get to the zen state where there is no the man. It's all about the work. It's all about what, what genius you're putting out is all about whatever, whether it's music or whether it's writing or whatever the fuck it is. It's all about finding that real pure place. So there is never the man, that's when the muse kicks in.

Speaker 1:          02:18:20       The idea of this, I, this all comes from somewhere else. It's like maybe it is just an attitude that allows you to bypass the ego. Maybe that's what the Muse is. It's just a scientific or a method of thinking that allows you to bypass the ego. It's effective, whatever. It is very effective. And I think also, and so you're never the man, you never feel like the man, well, you're bringing me to like the notion of celebrity for example. That's a really good point because celebrity actually doesn't exist. Like, like you've had celebrity for a long time. But like just with me now, things, you know, things were starting to, you know, you, I go to places and people recognize you and they want to take pictures or whatever and, and you think to yourself, well, I'm doing this TV show and I'm doing, it wasn't, and I guess in some ways I'm making lots of money and I've kind of arrived a little bit.

Speaker 1:          02:19:04       I mean, I'm kind of like, you know, I'm a working actor and there is zero difference actually in, in uh, what it takes for me to keep myself inspired. And if, if anything that's nice, it's a nice thing, but it certainly plays no real part in my overall fulfillment, which is really interesting. You know, and I, you know this really well. I mean, you know, I've been with you in Vegas. I remember what the height of fear factor when, I mean you had to literally go to the corner and rub your eyes because they're, they, everybody would take, they just, everybody wanted a picture. I really want to touch. Everybody wanted to be around you. That doesn't, that becomes, I guess in a lot of ways, um, the exact opposite of what you're going for. It's a privilege. It's nice, but it's actually a distraction.

Speaker 1:          02:19:47       It's actually not. It doesn't, it actually doesn't exist. It doesn't exist, but it does. It does. I just mean it does. Something he has to deal with is, yeah, it exists. But it is weird. What I mean? Is that what you think celebrity is going to be and then what it actually ends up being two totally different things. Yeah. That's all. That's all it is. That there is a dance that you have to do to in order to not get sucked into the wave, not get sucked into the gravity of the situation. Don't believe it or buy into it. You know, some people never do know. Brian, you've inspired people. This was a good podcast and you know, I've talked to so many people and I talked to a lot of them this weekend we did a the Irvine Improv and there was a lot of fun and uh, we talked to a lot of people that are podcast fans.

Speaker 1:          02:20:27       And one of the things, the number one thing that keeps coming up as these people say that it, first of all, a lot of people listen to it at work. They listen to what they're doing, stupid shit that they don't like doing and they just love the fact there's something like this out there. And two, they say it gives them an opportunity to look at things completely different. It's shaping the way people think. Man, there's, there's a difference between what we're doing here. Then the, the sort of the average radio show and the average podcast is we're not afraid to talk about weird deep shit and go and, and because of that, it's allowing other people to consider possibilities and ways of thinking that I don't think they would have. Like it's a privilege and I know the privilege for me to man, it's all, you know, it's great to be on the podcast.

Speaker 1:          02:21:08       It's, it's, it's, you know, and I have people come up to me all the time now. That's amazing. I'm going to give a little while listening to this thing right away. I'll be it. I'll be at the, uh, San Francisco Punch line. Have you done that? Punchline is great. I'll be there on August 10th to the 13th. That's my birthday. The 11th it is. Yeah. I'm going to call you ever done that, that happy birthday. It's amazing. It's a great, great club. It's one of the best clubs. It's a perfect height. It's one of those places. It's got the low ceilings. It's tight. I think it seats probably two 5,300 and now it's perfect. I can't wear a dude. I was just in San Francisco recently and God gave me a Bill Hicks last live performance at the punchline of last time I was there and gave it to me on DVD.

Speaker 1:          02:21:47       That's what's so amazing about being a comic, because you get to, you're performing with such a history in rooms like that. Oh yeah. I'll put one of those. The punchline. That's one of those, I'm doing the ice house, not this weekend coming up, but next weekend, which is the 22nd and 23rd the Ice House in Pasadena, and that's a small place. It's gonna sell out quick, but that place is the same place it's been for like 30 plus years, man. And there's photos on the wall of people from the bullies. I think it's one of the oldest comedy clubs in the country. Yes. Yeah, it is. It is. It's just doing the ice house. Come on down.
