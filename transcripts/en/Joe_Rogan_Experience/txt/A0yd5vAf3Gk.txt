Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Sound good? Yeah. We're good. Five, four, three, two.

Speaker 1:          00:00:08       That was a. That was like, you didn't do the film. I wasn't sure it was her finger button. Chris, what's up man? How are you? Good man. How you doing, Joe? Thanks for doing this. Uh, for people to name right now, Chris is the author of how to hike the Appalachian trail and he's also, I've talked about this on the podcast for this is his company is not a sponsor. This is company, a green belly meals and these are these really delicious bars that are. They weigh like 50 pounds a brick filled with nutrients and food and they're really good for people who did this crazy appalachian trail thing and these, these bars that you sell have become very popular with hunters and people that like to go on a backpack. Journeys deep into the back country and I found out about you from a rich, rich, rich outdoors podcast and that's where I listened to you on his podcast and that's why. That's why you're here. That's what I got. Cody loved the podcast. Yeah, it's a good podcast. So what the fuck for people who don't know the Appalachian trail, we've talked about this on the podcast before, but it's a trail where people walk from Georgia, right all the way up to Maine or, or vice versa, vice versa if you want, if you're a madman and it takes you. How many months?

Speaker 2:          00:01:28       Five to seven. Took me a little over six.

Speaker 1:          00:01:32       So you just hike for six months, but when you're at month three, do you ever go like, what the fuck am I doing?

Speaker 2:          00:01:41       Long story short? Yeah. Uh, and by month three I was actually approaching winter time and you know, wintertime camping is just a fundamentally different experience. So not only have you been hiking that long and you're tired and your body's just, you know, just done doing it every day of hiking. But then the elements of the, of the winter come in and that's, that was a different ballgame entirely. You know, how many people have done this? Less than $10,000. That's a lot of fucking people. Yeah, it is still a lot. I would have said like 50, uh, there's another thing called the triple crown, which is the, it's the, uh, it's, it's the 80 a pacific crest trail and the continental divide trail and I think less than a hundred people have done all three of those.

Speaker 1:          00:02:25       The Pacific crest trail, is that the one that goes from like Mexico tall to

Speaker 2:          00:02:30       Canada? It's through California. That's insane. How long did that one take? Uh, I think so. Appalachian trail is 2100 miles and the Pacific crest trail, I believe it's like 25, 26 when he was 700 miles. But the trail gradient is a lot easier. So I think like on any given day you can actually hike more miles even though the trails is longer than the 80, but I think people actually finish it faster than the eat. I like how you call it the 80 inside lingo

Speaker 1:          00:03:00       maniacs. Are you hiking maniacs? Yeah. What the fuck got you into this man?

Speaker 2:          00:03:06       Uh, it's a long story. Short boy scouts. Yeah, I did. Um, I joined boy scouts later than most people I joined when I was 14. And uh, you know, the kind of the pinnacle of the Boy Scout Careers, getting your Eagle Scout. And I joined with that in mind. I was like, okay, I'm joining later than most I joined when most people are quitting boy scouts, you know, they go from cub scouts like 13 and I quit by joined and I was like, all right, I want my eagle scout and we, you have to, in order to get your Eagle Scout spin 20 nights in the woods, not consecutively, but you have to, um, get your camping merit badge and get your camping merit badge. You have to spend the night 20 nights in the woods. So, uh, you know, that was in Georgia and the foothills of the Appalachian mountains are in north Georgia.

Speaker 2:          00:03:53       So the, you know, the, the beginning of the Appalachian trail is also, you know, right there. So we went on several trips up there in north Georgia and I got exposed to it, you know, and I think the, just the idea of getting on this small trail and um, you know, kind of looking down and understanding that this thing goes on for 2000 more miles was just kinda like one that just seems crazy. Right. You know, there's no way I'm ever going to have enough time or we're kind of the uh, the drive to do that. But um, yeah, there was definitely kind of the mystery. I was like, Oh man, that just seems like an adventure I want to do. Uh, so yeah, that was, that was definitely the beginning of it when I was about 14 years old going up there and hiking on it for overnight trips.

Speaker 1:          00:04:38       Now, how does one fund something like this? Because I would assume you, they have to be independently wealthy or you have to have squirreled away enough money so you could walk for seven months and feed yourself in the process. Or did you work along the way? I mean, you can't. What do you do?

Speaker 2:          00:04:55       I think there's a big misconception that like a, it takes a lot of money, but in reality it's like what are your expenses? It's just food, you know, and then gear ahead of time. So, um, you know, most hikers are kind of known as the, like the Athletic Hobo, you know, like they are grimy, they're not spending money on hotels, there's no accommodation, there's no car payments, you know, they're walking so you can really eliminate all expenses when you do that. But, um, I mean for me, I had a, I was an accountant, so, uh, I'd been an accountant for about, uh, two years and I saved up some money and uh, I basically knew that I wanted to take the hit so I started saving up some money, but any, any given through hiker, that's what they're called. Anybody that does, um, you know, it starts in Georgia, ends in Maine or Maine to Georgia. Anybody that does that hike, um, in one consecutive runs, it's called a through hiker, but any, any through hike I would, I would say it takes about $5,000 from gear to sleeping in hotels about once a week to resupplying foods. So thinking about $5,000 for six months of living like ain't too bad, you know, you think about $5,000 for six months of living in the real world. Like I've never lived that cheaply, you know?

Speaker 1:          00:06:13       Right. Well, it's not that bad. No, but like you're saying hotels once a week. So what would merit a hotel stay is a ferocious whether, like what,

Speaker 2:          00:06:23       um, a lot of things. So you, you typically are within five to seven days of a town, so the trail kind of goes along the mountains and then about every five to seven days you come to a trail crossing, which is a highway or anything that would lead to a nearby town and every five to seven days you're out of food. You know, that's the biggest thing that I think pulls you into towns. You need to resupply. So you're not out there foraging for nuts and berries or or hunting or anything like that. You're, you're relying on getting to town, getting to a grocery store and getting all your food. So every five to seven days you go into town and you get food. It's like, whoa man, I also haven't showered in five to seven days. I also haven't done laundry in five to seven days and you know, you're hiking with really one change of clothes. So you can imagine if you're hiking 20 miles a day, the grime and the dirt that can build up. So when you come to town, you want to do laundry, resupply food, you want to stay in a hotel, you want to clean off your body, your feet are starting to grow stuff. You know, you've been sweating, walking through muddy trails. There's just a lot of grime. When you get to town, it's like a big refresh, you know?

Speaker 1:          00:07:40       But when you make that big refresh, do you, do you ever go, why am I doing this?

Speaker 2:          00:07:45       Yeah, it's kind of, it's kind of ironic. You're on you. You make the intention of going down the trail to get outside of town and outside of society, but one of the biggest things you look forward to is getting back into town, you know? Um, yeah. And it's kind of like you said, well, you know, when you get to town it's like, why am I doing this? You are kind of. I was kind of dreading getting back out on the trail a lot of times because it was just so. Oh Man, I have a hot shower, like I shaved, like, so nice.

Speaker 1:          00:08:10       Yeah. The first time I did any camping in since the boys scouts. You're. Yeah, I was a boy scout when I was 13 for one summer, but these fucking inner city creeps that I went to the boy scouts with and Jamaica Plain Massachusetts, which is like, and now it's more a gentrified, but back then it was kind of a shady neighborhood picking on, you know. Well, they were, they would Thai kids up and leave them in the woods. They would tie you up to your bunk and then leave you in the woods. They put toothpaste all over your clothes, but you can't get out there just fucking shitty kids. It was, it was like a total free fall for all. It was just really didn't because we went to the woods in New Hampshire. That's where the boy scouts or take you up and I remember like these fucking camp counselors are weird guys that barely paying attention and it's basically like all these inner city teenagers, street scouts, yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:09:04       There's just running rampant. Like uh, there was a rifle range where they would shoot 20 twos and there was an archery range. And I remember I was at the archery range. I hurt and I was like, what the fuck is that? And they go, that's a ricochet and I'm at what? Alright, check please. And so I decided to just go fishing every day I was there. I would avoid everybody. There was like all those things on the agenda that you were supposed to do, fuck you. I just took off and I went and found this pond and I would go to that pond every day for the week that I was up there. My point being sent from that time from 13 till 2012, I had had not gone camping and then I went camping in Montana in October and really cold, it was like nine degrees and we were out there for six or seven days and when we went back we went back to a hotel and I remember thinking this is the greatest shower the world has ever known. Like that feeling. You don't appreciate showers. Oh No. Probably nobody appreciates a shower, like an appalachian trail hiker. Right. Does that make sense? It's pure ecstasy, like showers normal, like a normal showers normal. But it's like if you got to shower after you're hiking for seven days with muddy feet and your clothes stink and everything's gross and

Speaker 2:          00:10:23       yeah, you need that deprivation to appreciate it, you know,

Speaker 1:          00:10:26       you do. Right. Because most people don't appreciate showers.

Speaker 2:          00:10:29       Yeah. I guess it's like the starving kid needing, you know, when he gets food, he's like, oh, you know,

Speaker 1:          00:10:35       yeah. Or like a guy who just getting out of prison and get some sex. You're not getting any prison. Um, so what kind of Weirdos do you meet on the trail?

Speaker 2:          00:10:47       You gotta yeah, you gotTa keep in mind anybody who's willing to take six months out of their life to go to the woods, it's going to be a different breed. I mean, I think you definitely have your stereotypes. Um, some people are other just kind of for the challenge and the a out of, dare I say athletic side of it, but it's like a different side of it, right? Sure. It's Kinda like a, I want to power through this and see how much my body can handle. You get those kinds of hikers, but you definitely get the, the hippie dropout, a life kind of guys, you know, it's just like I just want to get out there and, and, uh, get away from society for a little bit so that, that kind of stereotype. You definitely, those are just gonna get some Weirdos out there.

Speaker 1:          00:11:27       Yeah, I would imagine if you ever had an uncomfortable moments where you like scared to camp with people.

Speaker 2:          00:11:32       No doubt. There was one time a man, there was a Pennsylvania. So Pennsylvania, uh, you know, a lot of those x coal towns, um, their economy just plummeted and the, it goes through a lot of those towns. So you'd have some people near town going out there for an overnight or, and they are what are called, they're like these three walled wooden structures that are made by, um, well all sorts of organizations make them. But in general they're about every 10 to 20 miles along the 80. So in theory you can sleep in these every night and not need a tent. I wouldn't recommend that. But, um, you do try to sleep in the shelters as much as possible. But the fact that there are these shelters, a lot of people kind of bottleneck to them because they know they're there. So you will sometimes get to a shelter at night and it won't only be a t through hikers there, there'll be people from town.

Speaker 2:          00:12:27       Um, but they, I remember one time in Pennsylvania, there were these, there was this couple. Yeah, they were literally, it was pouring rain. So we get there. And I was like, there's no way I'm camping out. There's no way I'm hiking on like I'm sleeping in the shelter, you know, I was drenched to the bone, my gear was drenched and I was pissed off. It was like a midnight, you know, I had been hiking all day. I was just exhausted. I'm so, so excited to get to the shelter and there's a couple and they are literally yelling at each other, you know, I, I can hear them for like a model, like just furiously yelling at each other and you get there and they are. Um, I never really knew, but I'm assuming they were cracked out. I saw some little glass pieces going in between their hands and just the way they're acting.

Speaker 2:          00:13:08       He kept like throwing up his fists at or he smashed a bottle on the wall in the shelter and uh, yeah, he pulled out a knife at one point and it was just like. So are these individuals shelters or is a large shelter when you see three walls? Like how big are these things? Uh, I think they're usually maybe about this size, length of this table, maybe about 10, 10 feet wide. And there's only one of them, so like, you're supposed to share them with those other people. Yeah. So you're in there with these cracked out people. Luckily I had three other hiking buddies with me guys and the people, granted they were aggressive towards each other, like they didn't bother us. And, and like I think by like 4:00 AM, they hadn't gotten to sleep and we were just like, dude, can you all please, please be quiet.

Speaker 2:          00:13:54       Like I got to get some sleep. And then, uh, um, but that was the worst one. Other than that, I think everything was, everything was pretty safe. There's nothing too terrifying. How did it play out? Uh, we left the next morning. And did they eventually go to sleep? Uh, you know what, I don't even remember. I think at 4:00 AM, I was so exhausted I was just like, they were still yelling at each other. I was just out, you know. And that was what they were yelling. I was just this one of those shelters. There you go. Yeah. That's one of them was looking little place. It's Kinda cool. It's all made out of logs. Yeah, it's got kind of a tin roof. Is that like a 10 sheet roof? Uh, yeah, they vary a lot. I mean you'll get all. Would you sometimes won't even get logs. Yeah, there you go. You can scroll up and see all the other ones. And those are for the hikers, is that what they're for? Yeah. So that's. So they've, they've anticipated, there's so many people that do this trail that they've made these shelters. I've heard of

Speaker 1:          00:14:51       these things in New Zealand. Yeah, too. Yeah, they have them and they stock food in them and they leave a log so that hikers can write down. Like my friend Remy, Remy Warren was in New Zealand and he used one of those and like wrote in the log, you know, where he was from when he was there. And I guess it also helps identify if people are missing.

Speaker 2:          00:15:14       Exactly, yeah. I think it's a safety precaution. So if, you know, you can kind of track down where it was the last person seen, you know, or wherever they last seen. So if they were, if they logged into a shelter and then, you know, they can't find them, they can say okay, on this date we know that they were here so you can give a given radius and know that if they are missing their within, at least within a certain, you know, 20 miles in distance walking distance of their. But yeah. And I think those things actually turned into like a just fun. You know, some people just go full on poems and there some, you know, confess like life stories and they're like, Oh God, yeah. The trail log books are entertaining the doubt.

Speaker 1:          00:15:51       Wow. Here, warning, what does it say? Harassing Baron. Camp night of five, 11 swipe clause in two tents stepped on my tent. Tila collapsed on me. Please be careful he didn't even try to get the food hanging low on a branch here. Oh, look at her name. Flower passion flower with a sad face. And there's another one. Bear rip. This is a different. This is a different person's handwriting. Bear rip the bag hanging on my pack, which was hanging on my hammock. I was Muslim. Say Bullshit. Bouncing, bouncing up and down. He stole my toilet paper. Exclamation point. What does that say? Subway. That's his name. Subway. Eat fresh.

Speaker 2:          00:16:38       Yeah. Ps, the pivot is great. What's a pivot? Are Pretty. It's the a privilege. It's just like an outhouse. Oh, compost. Toilet.

Speaker 1:          00:16:47       How about this one? Dat Shit cray all balls. Ghetto Savior, Baltimore. All balls. Ghetto Savior, Baltimore. Oh, okay. Okay. Well you're dealing with like fringe people, right? I mean these are people that are just not fitting into the corporate module

Speaker 2:          00:17:15       very well. They walked out on life a little bit. Yeah, a little bit.

Speaker 1:          00:17:19       Well you kind of did too, right? I mean you said you were an accountant.

Speaker 2:          00:17:22       Yeah, I was an accountant in Birmingham, so it was an accounting major and uh, did that for about two years. Um, I mean the job was good and everybody worked with I liked, but I definitely was able to recognize that there's not. I was not going to be an accountant know from my life. So, um, yeah, I think I knew it was going to do some transition. Try to get another job, do something. And the, uh, the ATU is kinda like, this seems like the right thing to do, you know, and I'm, I'm single at the time, you know, no kids a debt free, like, you know, I didn't have a mortgage like time to go,

Speaker 1:          00:17:55       so it just seemed like something this radical because it's so crazy. Committing to a six to seven month hike was going to force you to just change existence, change your frequency, the whole deal. I mean, you're a freak now. You're, you're wandering through the land with all due respect. Thanks dude. I mean it's not a bad forever. Like my best friends are freaks, but it's, I mean, it's definitely a freak move, right? I mean,

Speaker 2:          00:18:27       no doubt. Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:18:30       well it's a, it's a very strange subset of human beings that don't not just drop out but dropout. And I mean, you're, you're committing to something that is. I mean, there was, there ever a time we were like halfway there we like, maybe we just get a job in this fucking town.

Speaker 2:          00:18:47       Uh, and then some people did that, you know, I think that was more for financial reasons. It was like, all right, I gotta I gotta get some cash flow, but a no man, I think I definitely had kinda like a grind mindset. Like I'm gonna make it, I'm going to make it, you know, and I think that yeah. Did you go with a bunch of people know? Uh, I think like 90 percent of hikers go on eat alone and the fact that they're just, there are a lot of hikers out there, surprisingly particularly going north. You, I think maybe 2000 people try to go north every year.

Speaker 1:          00:19:22       Wow. So when you're hiking, there's like a gang of people on the trail with you.

Speaker 2:          00:19:27       So, but if you go south, um, it, it changes every year, but 10 to 15 percent of people that hike the Antigo self, it's like you're going to have much less social circles, stuff like that. But in general, you know, people are hiking, running like you're gonna meet people, you're talking about the shelters, like you're going to stumble into people walking by, you're going to meet them in town, you're gonna meet him at the shelters and they become your buddies. You know, like, even I think the first, the first night I was on the it. Yeah, I made good friends with two other people and hiked with them for a couple of weeks and then, you know, different paces. You've made up different people. You might hike with somebody for a month. Uh, so it's Kinda like you just hike for a little bit with some people, you know, for some given a time.

Speaker 1:          00:20:10       Wow. What kind of weird stories are they telling you about why they're out there? I mean, how many people are out there just like duck in a murder wrap or something?

Speaker 2:          00:20:18       Was it, um, is it Eric Rudolph? Which one was. Hey, Eric Rudolph didn't. He ran out and eat and like he, he was hiding out there for a long time.

Speaker 1:          00:20:29       Oh yeah. He was like the unabomber. No, no, no, that's, that's not the unabomber. The unabomber is Ted Kaczynski. He's that guy that was in the park bomber. Oh, okay.

Speaker 2:          00:20:39       So I believe it was Eric Rudolph was found in a dumpster in North Carolina. He had been hiding out, like full on hiker, homeless, look, beard grown. But he had been, you know, hiding out on a t,

Speaker 1:          00:20:52       it seems like that would be a lot of play, a place where a lot of people get robbed because you'd know that you have money on you because you have to make this trail, you have to have some cash to buy food. And

Speaker 2:          00:21:04       I never heard anything bad like that happened. Honestly. I know that they're, there have been a few murders on the 80. Oh Shit. But you think about, think about any given city, the murder rate, you know, it's like if you have 2000 through hikers plus, I mean 100,000 weakened hikers a year. I mean more than that, it's like the probability, if you think about the 80 hikers as a city, like a murder every few years, really it and in bed, you know,

Speaker 1:          00:21:28       that's the same logic that they use for those um, foxconn buildings where the people jump off the buildings where they're making cell phones in China that go, well, you've got to think about how many people work here. Of course, if you'd kill themselves, it's just a game of numbers at that point. Right. Somebody, somebody's going to do it. I guess it is. So will you ever there when any of that went down? They were looking for a murder.

Speaker 2:          00:21:49       Know there was a famous case. Oh, I forgot her name. Her hiker name. Hold on her name flower. All right. So that's what passion flower was. That's go to trail name. Oh Geez. Rappers. Yeah. So you get, you get your Dj Joe. Yeah. You get your trail name within, I mean yeah, within a week of being on trail within a week. Usually it's usually if you do something monumental or stupid or something noteworthy is going to give you. You dubbed a name. Wow. Do you know my name? Yes. It was smooth. Smooth, smooth. So I'd been in New Zealand prior to the Aat and I had talked about not like showering for a week at a time. We're getting real personal here, but I shaved my legs and I had shaved my body here so I could just like wipe down. Okay. And so when I came and ate at want to do the same thing, I was like, I'm just going to shave my body here so I can literally wipe down at night, um, and like check out for ticks, like just made snakes and a. and um, yeah, I was sitting right a fire early on, like a couple of nights in and I'm wearing my like, sweaty legs for like, glistening in the fire.

Speaker 1:          00:23:04       And some guy was just like, dude, do you shave your legs? I'm like, uh, no.

Speaker 2:          00:23:14       Uh, and then yeah, smooth just came from.

Speaker 1:          00:23:17       That's a funny one man. What a man makes a decision to shave his legs. That's how, you know, I never have, I've shaved some body parts. I've shaped my butt. I'm sorry, Ladies and Gentlemen, I've shaved my butthole a two, perhaps three times. I just had this conversation with someone about this the other day because, uh, it's, you know, I'm Harry, I'm a hairy dude other than the top of my head. But uh, I get hairy and so it's not the best for like keeping clean. So one day I was shaving my package and I said, let's just get crazy, let's go all the way down there, finish it all. And I did. And one of the things I was shocked was it changes the sound of your farts. Did we talk about this on the podcast before? I've heard it discussed on another podcast I talked about, right?

Speaker 1:          00:24:04       Yeah. It changes the sound of your farts. They become more duck like. Yeah. It's like something about your butt hair that muffles not that's the biggest issue in the world, but I'm also, when they grow back, it's quite unpleasant. The grow back process, like the itching and stuff, you know, there's something that happens when your hair starts growing back when you're like, Hey, I didn't think of this. This isn't what I signed up. Yeah. But that's where I end. I don't go through the legs, but I'm not opposed to it. It's not. It seems to me like there's a problem with why it's an issue, you know, like why is it an issue? But I dunno, there's something about, is it a sexuality thing? The Taboo? Yeah. Well, why bring it, bring it back to why is it okay to shave your head? Why is it okay to shave your face?

Speaker 1:          00:24:52       So get to shave all sorts and stuff. But if you start shaving your armpits, right? Dudes that shave their armpits, like, hey, what's going on? My shaving your armpits. You know, why not? What do you like where you're like hairy armpits. What's wrong with shaving your armpits? There is something though. If your friend yawned and you're like, hey dude, where the fuck is your armpit hair? It would be an issue. Right? He started calling me like, hey man, she makes armpits weird flux of doing it. You know? I know dudes that shave their legs though, but they're like super into fitness and they're like, you know, you shouldn't be like as you want your legs look good. Right? Yeah. Yeah. You don't want to like big, sloppy, fucked up looking legs that are shaved also. Then you let highlight like if you have like these big, like blocky tree trunk, sloppy legs, you'd want to keep them Harry. That he looked like some sort of a bear, you know?

Speaker 1:          00:25:47       Does that make sense? Yeah. There's something about like, okay, here's another thing. Shave your eyebrows. You shave your eyebrows. Like who the fuck shaved their eyebrows. It's weird, right? If you decide to shave your eyebrows, people gonna just go. You one of those guys. Meanwhile, just a couple inches south. You Shave your mustache. Nobody gives a shit. Totally normal. Seemed totally normal. There's something about shaving those eyebrows, right? That's true. Yeah. Or if you left your mustache and shaved your eyebrows, get the fuck away from me. Kind of a Weirdo. Are you? We have weird rules. Um, what was the weirdest name that you heard anybody get other than smooth? Where to begin? Um, fart master. I think that it's pretty self explanatory how it got that one. Uh, one of my favorites was I got a buddy of mine hiked with for a while. His name was hover

Speaker 2:          00:26:44       job hovered, hovered job. He went to, um, when you get out of it and it's like most people aren't even that familiar with the woods, right? So you start trying to figure out tips and tricks on how to do things. So one of the things is how to use the public facilities and uh, he was saying he, you know, he does the hover job. Oh yeah. That's a good move. Yeah. Everybody knows that one, right? We stopped at some gas station somewhere and you gotta take a shit. You have to be really careful. Yeah. You don't want to test the sets that sleep. Now, speaking of ticks, you were talking about ticks. Um, I know lyme disease is a huge issue on the east coast. I saw something nearly day that was saying this year is going to be a record year, some walnut hatching season something and I don't know, it was terrifying stuff. I did this show back a while back on the cipher. I called Joe Rogan questions everything. And one of the, one of the things we talked about was mostly conspiracy theories and it was really interesting to find the mindset of these conspiracy people and how they're all very similar, whether it's big foot or aliens or what.

Speaker 1:          00:27:44       They're really similar, sort of bizarre mindset that the way they look at things, they hit this very compartmentalized, fucked up way of looking at things. But one of the ones that we studied that was really fascinating, something called more Jaylen's, more gentleman's is a weird disease where people believe that they have these fibers growing out of their skin and they start itching themselves and they create these like lead Gen z scratches. And then things get attached to them like fibers from like perhaps from a carpet or something like that. And they think that they're growing out of their skin. And most people think it's a psychosomatic disorder. But one of the guys that I talked to was a doctor who also had more Jones. And he was really a very objective about it. And he said there seems to be some sort of a, um, neurotoxic effect that's connected to lyme disease. And he said that one of the things that these people that have more gentleman's have in common, they almost all have lyme disease. And what he believes is that ticks contain not just lyme disease, but a host of other different sort of, uh, diseases that you can catch. And so because of these weird different bacterias and different things that these toxins that these ticks potentially possess, when you get bit by certain ticks, you can actually hallucinate. And he would say, yeah, he was talking about and we saw a thread moving across his eyeball.

Speaker 2:          00:29:21       Wait, this is real stuff. That's of stuff. No, no, no, no. It's not sy stuff at all. It's real. People never even heard of this.

Speaker 1:          00:29:28       Yeah. Well it's generally thought to be a psychosomatic disorder. And that's why it was interesting talking to this doctor because he was saying yes and no because he was saying, well there isn't. He believes there's a real issue and that issue is lyme disease, but that these pathogens that are in these ticks, they, they're, they're not, it's not uniform. There are different in all these different ticks. Some of them are more potent than others and that there may be a host of different unidentified pathogenesis. There's not just lyme disease, but several others. And some of them have a neurotoxic effect and this neurotoxic effect can induce hallucinations. And some of those hallucinations can be that you think that your body's growing fibers out of it. And he, he said that he saw it moving across. Is it he goes, I know intellectually that it was not there.

Speaker 1:          00:30:14       He goes, there was no, I examined it. I looked at it was not there, but I saw it. Is that he personally experienced the notion. Yeah. And the other thing is a lot of these people, they go undiagnosed for long periods of time because for the longest time a lyme disease went undiagnosed and still does. I have a good buddy of mine, him and his son got bit by ticks when they were fishing. And uh, he brought his son to the doctor. And by then that bullseye, you know, around that grows or if you get bit by a tick that has lyme disease, there's like a bullseye. It looks like the red circle that grows around the area where the tick bit, him and the Bulls. I had gone away by the time he brought him to the doctor. So the doctor was incredulous and he's like, no, I don't, I don't believe that's lyme disease.

Speaker 1:          00:30:57       Kids from refined and then he started getting bell's Palsy. So half of his face was paralyzed and that's when they really realized that this, Oh my God, this kid has lyme disease for sure. And then yeah. And they were, they were in real bad shape. Like my friend who was skinny as it is, he wound up losing something like 20, 30 pounds and it fucked with him for close to a year. The other guys that he was with, uh, they got lyme disease as well as several people that were with got lyme disease and they were all fucked up for months. I knew one guy that got it and I think he went to the doctor and got some shots or antibiotics. I don't know what the treatment was, but he came back like full force and finished the two. Yeah, you can't do that if you get, if you get catch it, like really clearly.

Speaker 1:          00:31:38       We had a guy on the podcast, Steve, Steve Kotler, who got it, and he was undiagnosed for over a year and he wound up being bedridden for three years. Oh my gosh. Yeah. Yeah. Because the more it sinks into your system, the more you let it go or without antibiotics, without treatment. And again, with this doctor was telling me just relaying what this one doctor who had lyme disease was saying is that he believes that there's a host of different pathogens. There's not just one and he, he, he said there could be many that are undiscovered. Like lyme disease is fairly recent in terms of its discovery or our diagnosis of it. I feel like it's within the last two or three decades at the most, so I would worry about that. We're out there. The risk of the lyme disease on the Appalachian trail is going to be high this year. Trail life. Oh my God. How do you retrain life when you're out there? You don't even have started. Oh, just came out today though. Oh Shit. They're talking about touching. I didn't say that. There was another

Speaker 2:          00:32:40       article and I googled lyme disease from Connecticut that says that the testing on found ticks with lyme disease is higher this year, more than normal for last year. And repeat, you get bitten when you go

Speaker 1:          00:32:52       flooding. You can, I mean, I'm really careful, real careful to check myself. Also real careful to keep myself covered up, you know, I wear gators. I wear, um, you know, a long, like a Merino wool that goes all the way down to my ankles and then I pull the Merino wool socks way up over that. I don't have any exposed up to my wrists and I even wore gloves sometimes even in the heat aware, like a thin layer glove just to all also it's good to protect your hands from the sun but also to protect your hands from the animals. Seeing that white skin like you want a little white as you can that's exposed. But um, I think about that primarily about ticks scares the shit out of me. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:33:33       Oh, I wonder what percentage of ticks actually carry because I feel like I've probably been bitten by ticks in my life. You know, some like,

Speaker 1:          00:33:40       I don't know what percent of the job I got bit by a bunch when I was a kid, um, but I never got line but wasn't around that much when I was a kid. There was a thing about the New York upper New York state area being unbelievably infested. Have you ever seen a lyme disease map? Like a map of lyme disease infestation in the northeast, big time and this huge, huge, huge in the northeast and huge in New York state like that upper New York state area. Just really, really devastating. I wonder whether that isn't related to most. I don't know. Deer, deer, deer, deer, ticks apparently are a big issue. Here it is. Look at that. There you go. No, it's the 2015, but there's a few in California, especially northern California has a bunch, but look at that fucking ne Man. That's just like a Zombie plague. That's awful. Massachusetts is completely covered in it. Look at it. The whole street. New Jersey to covered. Yeah, but I'm just a devastating disease if you don't catch it, but guess it's spreading across the country. They're finding it in Florida now, new strains in Florida. What other issues do you have to deal with when it comes to like bugs and diseases and stuff like that? Grd. Uh, oh yeah. So what. Yeah, I was gonna ask you that. How do you, how do you get your water? Like what are you getting?

Speaker 2:          00:35:05       There's a thing called, um, basically you all freshwater water sources, so streams, lakes, ponds. Um, unfortunately the east coast is, it's so wet, you know, you're going to crossover water source very frequently. Generally several times a day you're going to cross at least a stream. So you fill up your water there. Uh, you carry two different containers to two bottles, one for dirty, one for clean. Uh, so you fill up a leader of nerdy water from the stream. I'm a ton of different water methods. I don't know if you do it in your back country hunting, but um, the big one I use with saw your squeeze. It's like a, a nozzle. You screw on top of your, uh, your water bottles he feel but dirty water bottle. Screw this water filter off and you squeeze out clean water. So that's what I used. But I mean a lot of really works that well.

Speaker 2:          00:35:56       You just squeeze it in. The water comes out clean. Yeah. The filtration system, is that good? Yeah. And it takes out Giardia. Yes. I think that kind of still standing. But uh, yeah. And then they're like the droplets which are basically a Columbian chemicals. Right. You know? Um, yeah. I mean, what else is there? All sorts of filters and chemicals. Some people try to boil it. That's just a pain. You don't want to boil water all the time and then wait for it to cool down before you get drink it. Yeah. I will say though, by the end of the, you talk about finishing and winter, um, you know, it's like whenever you stop at these freshwater sources, you know, the water's flowing and I'm, you know, it's like 20 degrees out, 15 degrees, you know, I'm like, I don't want to stick my hand in that freezing water and get my hands cold.

Speaker 2:          00:36:44       I can't hit them back up, you know. Um, so I'll, it admittedly, not that I recommend this, but I was, I was drinking it straight, man. Wow. Yeah, that's risky. It was risky, but it was just like I was so done by the end of it, you know, it's just like a, I don't have the patients to stop with freezing fingers, like, so numb, you know, the dexterity is just totally gone, you know, I'm like was just like, wow. So I'll see a doctor eventually. And uh, now when you, when you got to the end seven months, is that what it took you? I think it was, I got up trail for two weeks in between there for some family stuff. But uh, if you took out that two weeks, it was six months. I was on trail. So when you get off trail, did you go fly somewhere?

Speaker 2:          00:37:33       Honestly, I went to France with my family. Whoa, that's not, doesn't count dude. I. And it was like, oh, just a human trash can. I was just like cheese, wine, everything that I like I gained. I gained at least five, 10 pounds that week and I was just like, wow, just pigging out showing joint the shuttle. That vacation though. It was Kinda like that. It was like, you know, a lot of guys are getting up jokes. They're like, Oh man, I'm totally broken. Everything, like I'm going to France for a week or two. So some people get off trail just because financially they can't hack it anymore. Yeah, I mean you got a 19 year old guy who's at a high school. It doesn't have any savings. It's like, oh, I'm going to go ahead with a two. Sounds like a great idea. They haven't done any research, no planning, don't know anything about gear or anything, but you know, they've read a walk in the woods.

Speaker 2:          00:38:22       Um, and I think this is a good idea. It is a walk in the woods by Bill Bryson. It's probably the most popular book out there. It's like, um, it's just kind of a funny story. He's a good writer. Um, but he wrote that I in like the mid nineties. But that book, if you look at like the Appalachian trail hikers, it was just like put, bup, bup, bup, bup, bup, bup, a walk in the woods is released. I was like, wow. It was like huge publicity. And if you heard of wild the book movie, Reese Witherspoon.

Speaker 2:          00:38:51       No, I, yeah, I did hear about it. I never saw it. But yeah, that was, was that a movie about the Appalachian trail? Pacific crest trail. But it's, that was the same thing. It was like the eighties is so historic and iconic for long distance hiking trails that a walk in the woods did for the 80 what wilde did for the Pacific crest trail. But wild is only released a few years ago. Um, but I mean, same thing, it's like Pacific crest trail was relatively unknown to hikers and that book was released and an movie and it was just like now Pacific crest trail is really hot right now. The Pacific crest trail though is the one that goes from Mexico to California and it goes all the way to Canada. Oh, okay. Yeah, yeah. Top. There's not that much water there. No. Right. You talked about the east coast being wet.

Speaker 2:          00:39:34       I think so what do they do there? Uh, my understanding is they have big, um, I don't know the terminology is a big water reservoir, like a big concrete cylinder out in the middle of the, uh, of the desert and I don't know if it's rain water or if somebody actually goes out there and fills it up, kind, kinda like a trail trail. Angel kind of goes out there and trail angel. That's another term to trail angel take. We'll take it. We'll take a sidestep into. It's just a trend is going to educate us on the trail. Angel, go ahead. Smooth. All right. Yeah, we'll get, we'll get an 18 dictionary going. Um, but yeah, the trail angels in that term was um, when you're hiking and eat, you come to towns and you're like, uh, I need transportation to the grocery store. The grocery store is actually 10 miles away from the trail crossing. Like, okay, does that mean a hike 10 more miles down the highway to get some groceries? Then 10 more miles back. No, you hitchhike. And then you hitchhike in town. That's kind of that, that person then becomes a trail angel. Whoa. But hitchhiking is fucking dangerous. Have you ever done it? Um, maybe in the younger days. Trying to think.

Speaker 2:          00:40:50       I definitely got rides from people when my car broke down in, in Massachusetts, but I don't think I actually hitchhiked like that was desperation without intent. Like I'm going to get a ride from somebody. No, I never. I never went out there and put my thumb out and said I'm going to get from here to there by hitchhiking. Never do that. You did? Yeah, you did. You're, you're a fairly young guy. How old are you? Twenty eight. Twenty eight. Yeah. Okay. So you're talking about within the last 10 years you hitchhiked a fair amount. That's fucking crazy. That's like when people already know that hitchhiking is a good way to kill folks. Like if you want to kill somebody, what do you kill some fucking kid with a backpack. That's the move, right? It's a great opportunity to kill or above. You're going to be one of those

Speaker 1:          00:41:34       Psychos, you know? I would just assume yeah, everybody was pretty nice. You know, it's different parts of the country too, you know, like if you're going to go hitchhiking in like New York, you're gonna run into some really weird people if you're like just outside of Manhattan, you got, you thaw them out and you try and get picked up. You might get picked up by a fucking complete psycho. But if you're in Wyoming or something and there's like no one out there and you're hiking and

Speaker 2:          00:42:01       like rural Alabama, Pennsylvania, those crack heads screaming at each other, every other weirdos everywhere. But will say like, ah. So before the [inaudible] in New Zealand and New Zealand is higher standard of living in the states and I feel like you, there's very low crime right there. And hitchhiking is not taboo there. I always heard that New Zealand was kind of like the states, uh, was in the fifties and it was just like Kinda like a, a safe, happy place, you know, there's no crime. Everybody's nice to each other. High standard of living. And in New Zealand it was like they had um, some bus stops, like the equivalent of like a bus stop. And it was like a hitchhiking bench, so you would sit there and like people would drive on their way to work and somebody will be sitting on the bench like, Hey, pick me up, you know? But it's like systemized, you know, it's like people have hitchhike. So it was like that. The taboo was kind of broken in New Zealand. It was like, this is normal, people are, it's an economical, it's efficient. Like why not, you know, but

Speaker 1:          00:43:05       it's not something I would ever do. But man, I remember I got my car, my car broke down once in a snow storm and these people took me back to their house and they were so normal. They were really normal people and they made me that. I was on my way to visit my girlfriend and her mom and her drove to get me at these people's house and I was in there. I was driving up there and we just got caught in a freak snowstorm car broke down. And I remember thinking like, what kind of person? Just pick someone up and takes them to their how they're so nice. Let's be a Weirdo. But no, they were really nice, they were really nice people. They just took a chance, you know,

Speaker 2:          00:43:41       I guess the fear comes from that like point, oh, one percent, right. That's going to do something with like a vast majority or you know, why not? I'm just looking to help somebody out. It was like something with like airbnb. There was that fear. It was like, oh, there's no way I could let somebody come into my house or couchsurfing. Couchsurfing is, it's like, um, airbnb for free. Essentially. You put up your couch on this website and you offer. Um, yeah, see, like I've got a couch, does anybody want to stay on it? And then you say, I'm coming through on these dates and your request the couch for free. But it's like, remember that when that website was really becoming popular about 10 years ago, people had that same idea. I was like, no way. This is only for nutjobs. Like it's hugely popular now. And airbnb and all that stuff's like, yeah, let somebody come and stay in your house

Speaker 1:          00:44:29       and meet travelers. Share authentic travel experiences as opposed to what? Fake travel experiences. Fuck, does that mean authentic? Meet New People, explore the world, go on a rape binge, find a couch. I'll find a host. There's a couch. Is a graphic of a couch. So this is. What is this? What is this website? Jamie? Couchsurfing.com. Yeah. What? But that's what's crazy is that somebody decided to organize this. They decided to make a website. Every year we support 400,000 hosts, 4 million surfers. I love. I call them surfers. Isn't imaginary or real surfer. And you heard this like, listen, bitch fucking surf or you don't even have to balance your laying down some dudes couch hundred thousand events. They support a 100,000 events. This is crazy. I never knew about this. Yeah, I mean they're also like niche websites that have another one. Uh, scroll down Jamie. That image.

Speaker 1:          00:45:26       Warm showers is another one. That's first cyclists. Look at that guy like updating the top of the world. Ready for your next adventure. Planet trip. Stay on my couch. It's very strange in Paris. You can go surf and look in Paris you've got find food and wine and cheese and bread. You can afford that. You can't afford a fucking hotel room. Let's see. That's like a fucking expensive meal right there. Looking at some really delicious food. It's very, uh, strange because it's a very romanticized, like this is really organized. This website's super well done. Local hosts and they have avatars of images, reviews. Oh my God, look, it's Louis joined couchsurfing to see loses full profile. It's free about me. Current mission. Can I host one person only? Wow. This is weird. You can put your ketchup. Do. Nope. That's not gonna happen. But it is interesting.

Speaker 1:          00:46:30       I mean it's like, it's the good aspects of it are, I'm sure far outweigh the negatives. You know, most people are just enjoying themselves. Meeting nice people, meeting like minded people, traveling around. Like my feet are obviously humor aside, but my fears are probably fairly unfounded. Right. But isn't that kind of how it is with life like most, most people that you meet, like the vast majority of people are really pretty nice. Like this is all intention. It's a really safe time to be a person, you know? I mean, almost all interactions you have with people on a daily basis are safe and fairly friendly. Even like rude people are like, well, what's the big deal? They say a word, you know, like most. Yeah. Most. Almost nothing happens most of the time, but we're so obsessed with the news where you tune into any news channel, all you're getting is the collective bad news of 7 billion people because that's what sells.

Speaker 1:          00:47:34       If it bleeds, it leads run with it. Mike. Mike runs with it. Yeah. You know, I mean this is, that's actually a very. When you really look at it that way, that's a very positive trend that people are doing this hosting, hosting people, shared shared economy. What's this? That's really nice. You know, it's nice that people will offer up their couch for free. Yeah, it's good stuff. It is good stuff. So do you ever stop and think like what if I hadn't gone on this journey of exploration and I stayed in the accountant and you would be living that life of the droning existence where every day he just fucking Sean over the same place, crunching numbers and hating life and wishing for some kind of adventure, something different. No,

Speaker 2:          00:48:28       I can't, I can't relate to. I think no matter what, whether it's 80 or something, I think I would have, you know, I'm too impatient, you know, I get bored too easily. Something, you know, I would have done something

Speaker 1:          00:48:39       then a lot of people don't. A lot of people are like you and they just never make that move. They never, they never take that chance.

Speaker 2:          00:48:45       So yeah, I think when I talked to even a lot of my friends that are still doing, I'm not going to call them crappy jobs, but you know, because I think they do provide a lot of things that they like, you know, security. You can't. Some people love that security, getting a paycheck, you know? Um, but it's like, I don't think they view it like that. It's not like, oh, this may not be the best thing, but I like it, you know, it's not like A. I don't know. It's like some people think this is so bad or I, I just can't. I just have to like, I just don't think that, that, that threshold ever crosses most people, you know?

Speaker 1:          00:49:15       Yeah. Well, you know, people very, you know, the personality types that go on that trail. I mean that's like a very, very extreme personality type, but I think most people have a certain amount of, if not wanderlust, at least curiosity. It's just a matter of how much of it do you, how much of it do you nurture? How much of, how much of that that needed to feed this. Also, there's also a real problem than not recognizing the finite nature of existence. You know, I mean just when you're 20 especially or 21 or whatever it is, when you enter into these jobs you don't realize like, hey man, you've only got like a few decades. Right? Have a good time. You could do this for 40 years easily. Oh, easily, easily. And then we've all met those people that have done it for 40 years and they just beaten down by life and they have that dull, desperate look in their eyes. It's just the sadness in their eyes where their life is just. It's not, it's not good. It hasn't turned out well. There's not a lot of joy there. Yeah. And hold onto the vacations. Big Time. You're scaring the shit out of me, Chris. Scaring the shit out

Speaker 2:          00:50:27       of me. So you in the middle of doing all this, right? So you do this, you go on this crazy seven month adventure and when it's over,

Speaker 2:          00:50:37       what was that like when you, when you hit the end and you realize they're like a bell, you ring or anything like that. She put a bell up there. So going north, but there's, there's like, there's like this epic Mountain Qatada and it's like a beautiful big mountain. I'm one of the, like the most epic climbs that's in Maine. So if you go south, you end in Georgia and you end on Springer Mountain, which is just not as, not as that, but God is dramatic. You know, you're right. So, but yeah, I mean you finish it, there's just a plaque and it's like, dude, you finished really? And you touch the plaque, you have to touch it. What does he get right before and you quit right before like a flint before the fuck this. Just gloves for the plan. Yeah, that's it. So that's good. That's the main.

Speaker 2:          00:51:19       That's the, that's the finish and finish. And uh, yeah, north bounders. How many people fake it? Take a picture of that dude. Dude, you can go hike that in one day. Yeah, for sure. It's usually, at least I would probably do that. I'd go hike it in a day and then get that weird feeling of watching these people that are covered in two inches of grime. Climb up that hill. Can you pull up spraying that guy? That motherfucker. Look at that guy. That guy looks like he's been hiking for seven months. Hecker Springer Mountain. Look at that guy's face. Jesus Christ. He's just all hair. And

Speaker 2:          00:51:59       so, um, there you go. Yeah, that's the uh, that's where it starts. Is that the gateway? That's, that's what's called the approach trail. It's not the, I'm like, well I kinda has like a, an on. That's the actual plaque on the end, but that's not a great shot of it. There you go to. So that's where it starts. Yep. National scenic trail. Now who established this? Uh, so the kind of in Benton Benton, MCI. I'm trying to talk people into doing that with you. Like when you first started doing that, like what year did this guy do this?

Speaker 2:          00:52:36       I know I know these dates, but I don't think they can guarantee 30 days. So imagine 19 thirties. Fucking great depression that all deal. Those are the people back then and this guy says, I know what do, I'm going to walk all the way up to Maine and I'm going to start a whole movement. A bunch of other people going to do as well. Like, fuck you dude. And get a job. Hippie. Yeah. The CCC at the time was helping construct all the uh, the trails at that Springer Mountain, Georgia. Eight point five miles mount. How to say it? Catoctin catoctin main 2000. One hundred and eight point five miles. Those point five or a motherfucker that last point five. Oh, so when you did it and you touch the sign and you're like, all right, I did it. I cried. Did you? I did. I literally clubs.

Speaker 2:          00:53:25       Wow. Well you failed you knees. It was like, it was seriously one of the most emotional times in my life. I couldn't imagine. I was just, yeah. Even even like that morning I woke up and I was just like, oh my gosh, this is, this is ending, you know, it was like so much, just so long. I had been thinking about it from. Yeah, I mean childhood, you know, and then it was like not only thinking about it for a decade, but then it was actually hiking the darn thing for six months and it was just like getting there. But that time, like I had stress fractures forming and my feet and uh, yeah, I was just in bad shape. I wasn't sleeping well because, you know, at night it was going to get into zero degrees every night and my sleeping bag was not cutting it.

Speaker 2:          00:54:03       So it's just like, it was just a lot man, you know, stress fractures in your feet, huh? Yeah, yeah. Yeah. And I, I've had had stress fractures from cross country in high school, so I knew what they felt like, oh, this is coming. It's just a matter of time, you know. Now what kind of hiking shoes did you wear? Okay. We, it seems like your gear would be critical big time. Yeah. Uh, I started off with a brand called Selayla. They were kind of like a technical climbing shoe actually, but um, the fact that they are a little more stiff, stiff, exactly. Um, makes them good for some tough, tough trail. But uh, I switched to a trail runners and I don't do run. Yeah, I started reading really, really recently, like a few days. I think I saw you post something on facebook. You had a rough, a rough run, fucking terrible at it.

Speaker 2:          00:54:49       A bit like a bowling ball. It's not good for running some weight, want to keep doing this. But yeah, I've been running for a few days now. But uh, yeah, I switched to um, basically just running shoes with the little thicker tread, like Solomon's Solomon's is a great brand. I got those for the very purpose of running up hills. You like them? Yeah, it seemed good. They've got good traction to them. Could tread like a thick tread, but yet there are still built like a running shoe. It was a good hiking shoes. Something that you can breathe and give you some cushion and you don't need any ankle support, you know, feel. I feel like that's overrated mountaineering thing. Yeah. I think there's kind of this theory that your ankles toughened up. Um, I don't know if that's really true, but I think I kind of fell into that belief that I was rolling ankles so much in the first 100, 200 miles of the trail and by the end of it was just like, just keep going, you know?

Speaker 2:          00:55:41       Yeah, yeah. Well, I've always wondered about that because a lot of people that hunt, they were these like really stiff, very tactical mountain hiking boots where they, uh, they go out that, you know, they go like 10 inches up the ankle and they lace them up tight. Yeah. I say when I used to go hunting with my dad when I was a kid and we would, we would wear those boots and uh, looking back I'm like, Eh, I don't get it. And is it just because maybe the brush is just so thick you need something like durable to cross through that brush. It's like, I don't think so. What do you mean? What do you wear when you go hunting? Well, it varies. I've never worn. I'm running shoes like those, like trail running shoes, but I know some people do do, do wear those and they like them and some really good hunters.

Speaker 2:          00:56:26       They were them exclusively. There were like lightweight trail runners and they, and even Solomon actually makes a gator for those trail runners so that you can, for people to know what a gator is. Gators like a thing that you slip over your shoes and it cinches down tight so that rocks and dirt and stuff doesn't get deep into your shoe. Um, and I think who you is coming out with a boot that actually has a gator built in was kind of interesting, but they could see the salomon trail gaters yeah. See, so the idea is to make sure that you're not getting irritants, dirt and shit and debris. Did you ever wear anything like that when you were? Definitely, yeah, definitely. Yeah. Is that a, is that a must have some hikers? I'd say kind of roll their eyes at it. I started off rolling my eyes at it and then it was just like you're saying it was just good.

Speaker 2:          00:57:15       I mean five times a day I would get a little pine needle in my sock and it's just like, oh damn it. Like, yeah, I got to get something to keep that going out. So I would imagine that you would have an incredible ability to test gear. Like nobody would probably know what gears effective and durable and really, really like over the longterm. Yeah, totally. And it's like, I mean, a part of the Ata, I'd been backpacking for over 10 years and I thought I was kind of okay, I'm pretty familiar with this stuff. And I was like, no, no, I didn't know anything about backpacking. And Yeah, you test everything, you know, and it's like even even after all your research, you start realizing like, hmm, there's a little bit better stuff out there or yeah, I can actually tweak this and improve this and that.

Speaker 2:          00:57:56       But yeah. But at the end of it, it's like anybody was through hike. This can get into some real nerdy backpacking gear talk, you know, hunters get into real nerdy backpacking gear talk when they talk about like deep in the woods, back country hunting because weights initiative, huge issue. They chop the ends off of their toothbrushes, you know, that's like a big issue with you. You did that to big time. Yeah. Wow. That's so crazy. Like the idea that the bottom of your toothbrush every ounce, man, that's fine. You won't ounces equals pounds, right? Yeah. So that was one thing that got cody and I talked to him was cody was talking about cutting, cutting weight from backpacking. I feel like my impression, at least when we were talking, I was thinking hunters. We're almost kind of the, the Chubby guy in the blind. It was kind of my idea.

Speaker 2:          00:58:41       I was like, when my dad and I would hunt, it was Kinda just truly sitting there with blue jeans and it was just kinda like, all right, there's a duck, you know, it was like talking to cody, I think hunting I was doing was pretty amateur and it was. Cody was talking about cutting weight significantly in that. Hunters have kind of latched onto some of the backpacking, you know, ethos, if you will, about shaving every ounce. But it's like y'all carry so much more gear. Like you got weapons, you know, like that's. Those things aren't made to count every ounce I would imagine we had. Depends on what you caring. But there are some lightweight rifles that people use so that are like carbon five barrels and stuff. But the issue with those is they, unless you're like prone and you're laying

Speaker 1:          00:59:22       down on something, they move a little bit more and a lot of people think they're not as accurate as like a real heavy rifle. Like a lot of guys. Sacrifices. Yeah. They look a heavy rifle, like a heavy barrel, thick, heavy barrel. And the same thing was bose. That's a weird thing. Like some people like heavy bose because it's usually you hold steadier, you know, there's the thought behind it that you have something light in your hand and you're shaking a little bit. Like maybe you're a little nerves, he might move around a little bit more, but if you've got something that's stable, he heavy, you know, you'll have more stability when you're executing the shot. But killer equipment to. Yeah, a lot of guys carry spotting scopes and 15 power by nose and they have eight to 10 power by nose around their neck.

Speaker 1:          01:00:07       And you know. Yeah, depends on what kind of stuff you use. You know, some people, they'll sacrifice, uh, like spotting scopes. They won't do that, they won't bring it. But some people were, some people also want to film other stuff, so they bring tripods for filming and a tripod for glassing glassing meaning you know, lock, uh, uh, either by [inaudible] or a spotting scope on a tripod, so you get a real steady view because it really makes a difference. Like if you see more animals, yeah, if you're holding up like the [inaudible] in your hand, you got to Kinda like put your elbows on your knees and you sit down. But it's not as good like being on a tripod, so the best way for sure. But then you got carry the equipment, you've got to carry that fucking tripod around. And there's, I think there's a big difference between people that they carry their stuff in and then they make a camp versus people to keep their camp on their back all the time.

Speaker 1:          01:01:02       There's a lot of that too. There's different kinds of hunting. Like, dude, do you know that ever took bag? Wait, I think cody was mentioning it was like 60 or 70 pounds. Do you have any idea? Yeah. A lot of guys will carry in 60, 70 pounds. That's pretty standard, but again, they're not. These guys are not carrying their camp on their back just. But if they do like if they know they have to go in deep and they have to live off their back. Like they have a Bibi Bibi tent and they, they do the whole thing off their back. Most guys would try to drop it in the forties, but if you carry around 40 fucking pounds, man, like there's a company called the outdoorsman and Phoenix and they make like a real high end pack and one of the things that they've made that they actually just sent me, it's a pack frame that has like an Olympic plate mount on it.

Speaker 1:          01:01:45       So you can put like a 45 pound plate and another 45 pound platelet and 90 pound plate and you train with his fucking pack frame on. So you put the frame on. You mean like a little, like a weight lifting, like lifting slides onto your back the same way with slide onto the end of a barbell and it, you know, use a clamp, like a, like a barbell clamp locks the plate in place, and then you go up hills and these fucking things on. So these guys are just trending. Yeah, they're training to get ready for these back country hunts. I had the same idea as you did. I thought hunters like, oh, duck dynasty guys. They're all fat. Right? And they just rednecks. They're shooting at Shit. No, not western hunting is a big difference between the southern hunter. Yeah. Well there's a big difference between blind hunting, like people that sit in these blinds when blind is, is like for people listening is like, it's basically like a little structure that's covered with like Cammo and you're, you're hiding, you're hiding, waiting for the animal, and then you shoot them or tree stand, same thing.

Speaker 1:          01:02:47       You're sitting in the tree stand, you're waiting and then you shoot them. There's a big difference between that and these western hunters, particularly like elk hunters because they're going into the mountains where these animals live or mule deer, they're going to the high country and you're climbing up, you're going up thousands of feet of elevation every day up and down, up and down, and you have to have massive endurance. So a lot of these guys start trail running. A lot of these guys start putting packs on their back with, with heavyweights in the pack and training, getting ready for this. Otherwise you're fucking miserable. If you're not in a real shape, you're miserable. You know? Got a good foot. You got to get a real fit. Interesting. Yeah, that's not what it is. Well, my friend Cameron names, he does a lot of ultra marathons. He just, he just did the big foot 200, which is 205 miles in Washington state.

Speaker 1:          01:03:34       How long has it to 78 hours. He ran for seven, eight hours. Wow. Fuck everything about that will. Right. But, but that just shows, you mean he's as extreme as it gets. You know, he's like one of the top bowhunters in the world, but the point is these people are athletes, the w, the, the, the ca in the group of them, the elite of the elite there, so few. It's a really, really small club of individuals that get to that point, but the vast majority of them are in spectacular shape where they're constantly running trails. There are constantly working out. They're constantly in shape and the reason being is if you're not, you're not going to be successful in the back country. And one of the things that really haunt them is when they can't get to an animal because they're out of shape. And I've been there before. I've tried that where I was like, well, when I was last year I was hunting with cam and we went up, we're trying to get to this elk, and he ran up the hill like a fucking mountain goat and I'm halfway behind them.

Speaker 1:          01:04:33       I thought it was in pretty good shape and I am for the stuff I do, but I wasn't in good shape for running up hills. You know, you gotTa, you gotta do that to be in shape for running up hills. You've got to run up hills and a lot of these guys there, they have these uh, events, these, uh, trained to hunt events that they do where they compete against each other and they put backpacks on and they run and they, they, they try to get from point a to point b faster. There's a lot of people are criticizing. You think it's kind of dangerous and it's because it's not really running with weapons. What is the interest about it? Wait, you're talking about still about the barbell. The barbell things is completely new and ventured by the outdoorsman. It, it hasn't even come out yet, but most people just pack heavyweights like sandbags and strap down at their backpack.

Speaker 1:          01:05:19       But uh, it's, it's a different world as far as like the perception of what these people are versus what they're actually doing. And there's a real ignorance when people are talking about hunting, they think of it as like this really easy thing. You just go shoot this animal. And they think the hunters are cruel because that's what bad thing that killed Bambi and you know what I mean, like this is weird ideas that people have in their head about what hunting is. And I think in general that was kind of my impression of the, uh, I guess, I don't know if easy is the right word, but yeah, not, not physical. Certainly enough physical. No one would think from the outside without really examining it and looking in that you're talking about like elite endurance athletes. But if you took the average person that thinks they're in shape, and I have friends that have done this before, taking people that think they're in shape and take them on these hunts.

Speaker 1:          01:06:07       And these people break down slug. Yeah. They just can't make it. They can't do it. They just, they're just not prepared for it. And it's hard to prepare. And there's, they say there's very few things you can do other than put weight on your back and go up, go up and down hills and just do it. Yeah. Some people say boxes, you know, steps, you know, those things. Like when people step up with one leg at a gym, you know, and they, and they do that over and over again. Some people say that that's a good way to prepare for, for hiking as well. Just box steps over and over again, like commit to the. Yep. Yeah, just get those quads. I run, I'm weird. Weirdly in some ways. Um, trail bikes apparently very good like doing dirt bike because you're constantly pumping one leg at a time and apparently that is very good for mimicking the type of strength that you need to get up.

Speaker 1:          01:06:58       And down hills goes back to like what you said about just doing it though. It's was like, yeah, just do it, you know, it sucks though, man. I did it the other day. I did a five mile hike or four mile hike and uh, one of the, the whole one of the miles I did with my daughter who's 50 pounds and from a mile up the hill I carried her on my back. So she worked. She got tired and so, uh, I put her on my shoulders and I carried her one mile straight up hill on my back and all my God, I was drawn ranched. I mean my jet, my Hoodie, I was wearing a hoodie. It was soaked to the bone, put sweat was pouring down my head. I was heaving as I was carrying her, you know, it's really interesting how difficult it is because just the hike, it's kinda difficult, but I could do it because I'm in pretty good shape.

Speaker 1:          01:07:44       But the hike with a 50 pound kid on your shoulders fucking a thousand times harder of A. Yeah, it's hard. But I, uh, but I used it as a workout and she's like, if you're too tired you can stop. Like, no, no, it's a good workout. It's good. It's good for me. You know, it was probably freaked her out here. Maybe go carrying or like thinking I'm going to fall or something like that. But it wasn't, wasn't dangerous. Like it wasn't like I was, my legs were failing, but I was breathing fucking heavy, that's for sure. So you've got to imagine these guys that are carrying 20 pounds more than that and they're carrying their weight deep into the mountains, you know, or the pack out. That's the other thing. When you kill an animal, like you've got 100 pounds on your back now and you've got to slowly but surely make your way in. A lot of guys get seriously injured during this.

Speaker 2:          01:08:35       Let's say, what do you do to drag it? You put it in your backpack. One hundred pound animal

Speaker 1:          01:08:40       [inaudible] yeah, we'll know much more than a hundred pound animal. Usually any deer you shoot is going to be more than 100 pounds and an elk is way more than a hundred pounds. So what you're doing is you're making multiple trips with 100 pounds on your back. The heck it up. Yeah. You have to chop it up. Now when it comes to like backpacks and things along those lines, like what? How do you choose what kind of backpack you need? And like you, you must have like a weight consideration as well. And as far as volume, like how much stuff you need. You said you carry one change of clothes, so you basically have one pair of socks, one pair of underwear, one pair of pants, other than stuff you have on, right, you bring a change of shoes,

Speaker 2:          01:09:21       um, you typically break it up by activity so you have, um, hiking and sleeping, so you have your hiking set of clothes and gear and then you have your sleeping. So hiking clothes are usually like a, just like maybe like workout clothes, like a synthetic, short sleeve top, maybe even running shorts, um, and you know, a set of socks to hike in and then your trail runners to hike in. Um, it's Kinda like you're hiking attire, you know, I'm certainly not like the pant hiking boot kind of image. I think that's, that's, that's, you know, going away. And then you have your sleeping set of closed your camp clothes, which is a typically like a very minimalist camp shoe. It's all about weight because that's, that piece of footwear is on your back, right? So you want to make sure that one's light, you know, so a lot of people even used crocs.

Speaker 2:          01:10:13       I know these crocs because it's super light, it's light and it's waterproof and walk around camping. Um, and then, um, you know, some kind of wool, like honestly this, I love this book, a Merino Merino wool, something warm to sleep in something dry like that. Those clothes, like get your hiking clothes, wet, dirty all day long, but when you come home or when you get to camp at night, it's like, keep it, make sure it's comfortable, make sure it's drugs. That's your saving grace if you have to go to sleep in wet clothes and wintertime, like, that's no good.

Speaker 1:          01:10:42       Yeah. Now why, uh, why synthetic? Why do you choose synthetic? So I know a lot of people choose Marino for, for hiking as well because it regulates temperature. Well, and when it's wet you could still stay warm.

Speaker 2:          01:10:54       Uh, I think you, I mean, you can have arguments on both sides. Uh, I personally like synthetic just because I feel like it dries faster and it's a little more durable like this is, this would just tear, you know, and it's like, I like getting down and dirty when I hike and I'm like a synthetic shirt even just from Walmart, you know, nothing, nothing amazing. Just delights lightweight since the synthetic shirt. Um, I think it was just going to breathe and uh, um, yeah, dry faster, but I mean marina marina to and what kind of package using a man I could totally nerd out on packs. I did it. I used an osprey on actual 80 a hike. I don't want to talk bad about Osprey spray spray a lot, but I would not hike with them again and I do, um, how come a hate to be, you know, kind of, um, from aesthetics, but I just don't like the way they look.

Speaker 2:          01:11:41       Got This, they've got this like, um, that seems like the last thing that you consider when you're wearing crocs, but that's true. But they have this, um, they kind of pride themselves and breathable back. Do you know what? I'm know that was pretty like they have like that concave back and it just feels like a, like a turtle shell as can't stand it. It's like, I feel like I'm like falling back with it. Okay. So the weight's not tight to your back. Yeah. I want something snug on my back. Um, I guess that's not. I mean it's a little utility. Not that's a big issue for utility. Yeah. Yeah, exactly. You just think they look weird to. Exactly. It's like, I don't like it looks bizarre. Like what's the name of the practice? We can pull it up a osprey. Exos. Fifty eight. Um, and so that's 5,800 liters.

Speaker 2:          01:12:24       Is that what it is? It's 58 liters. Fifty eight liters. Liters. Yeah. And then um, but um, if I were to do it again, there are a handful of pretty bad ass ultra light pat companies. It's kind of, you've got this bell curve of like Osprey is like the majority of backpackers and it's like you get into like that niche ultra light and then you've got like a handful too. There. It is appealing. Yeah. That's it. So that's a, just looks like a space in between the back. Right? I'm not into that. So that's just for breathability. Yeah. But it's like, man, you're sweaty pig. No matter how you look at it, I just don't, I just don't see the argument for breathability back there. There's some people like it. Definitely. So it's just a, it's maybe personal preference. Yeah. So what is like, what's the elite of the elite?

Speaker 2:          01:13:12       Uh, I could, I would probably say like four. There's a hyperlink mountain gear, uh, they make. What's a Cuban fiber? Do you know? Cuban fiber, the material, Cuban, Cuban fiber. It's called Dyneema now. It's okay. I've heard of Dyneema Dyneema for um, both strings. Oh yeah, yeah. Um, so, uh, but it's lightweight, strong on. They're super expensive. Hyperlight mountain gear mix. I like their packs. Gossamer gear. They make great packs, a little more affordable. Super lightweight granite gear. It's another one. And then ula equipment, was it probably be the four pack companies I'd, uh, I'd want, I'd want to use for the next cycle would, if there's a, is there a cost, not an option. Best best one or is it just all four of them are really similar. Even the guy, the gossamer gear, Mariposa, that's a model. They're probably more affordable than some of the other options. I'd probably like it the most. So yeah. Even even if money wouldn't, you know, money wasn't an issue there,

Speaker 1:          01:14:14       so one of the more affordable packs and make the best. What's interesting about pacs is a lot of it is like where it centers the weight on you and you can make one pack with the same amount of weight would feel lighter than another pack just by the way it's designed and the way the load lifters work and all that jazz and your torso length, like you know what fit you might not fit me. Right, right. Yeah. It's like, yeah, I went backpacking with my girlfriend. I gave her some of my pecs and her torso just so much shorter than mine. Like the hip belt wasn't working properly so she can rest the weight on her hips and then it's all on her shoulders and then she's like, God, this sucks. And I'm like, that's one of the best picks up there, you know. So do you have to, can you adjust it for her or is it just needs a bit different path? I did different. You need different says hm. That's interesting. So how do you know what to choose? You have to just try them out.

Speaker 2:          01:15:05       Uh, I would. Yeah. And to try them out. And it's hard to do because like your local Rei, um, I don't know if they don't carry those kind of niche ultralight Pepsi can't go try them on. They care, they'll carry on, they'll carry osprey. Yeah. Good. Try him on measure torso link. Some of those online retailers have ways to measure your torso length, makes sure it fits right. But still at the end of the day, it's like a pair of shoes. You gotta you gotta try them on. You know,

Speaker 1:          01:15:32       it's interesting because hunters in general do not use the same packs that backpackers use. Probably more holsters and all sorts of stuff you need. Your needs are different I would imagine. Right? Yeah, for the most part. But a lot of it is like certain things you strapped to the pack, like you strap your boat or your pack and some of them have like rifle holsters or rifle, you know, scabbards that you can kind of contain a rifle and like a lot of them have a little packets or air areas. We get strapped down and tripod or maybe the top compartment you would keep your, your binoculars or something along those lines. But I would think that there would be like a lot of crossover and there's not. There's exclusive sort of segment of the population or of the market rather. Why is that? Is it just marketing it?

Speaker 1:          01:16:20       Just targeting different audience? I don't know because I wouldn't think that that would be the case because it's not the case really with boots that much as a lot of people use like Solomon's and really standard hiking boots. There are hunting boots like crispy and Kenna track and there's a few of those that are like specifically designed [inaudible] snake. Like people use using for other things too, but they're like really well known in the hunting world. Maybe the markets will start blending, I wonder, but I'm just wondering like you would think you would go to those guys, the backpackers, the, the Appalachian trail people like they would have already done the work. I would think that that's the people to contact. They know what's good. Yeah. They're traveling for seven fucking months. You, you know? No. Do you take like a nalgene bottle or something like that with you? Like smart water bottles? Smart water.

Speaker 2:          01:17:10       That's it. Really? Yeah. Like, I mean these water bottles are fine. Um, but uh, I like smart water because you talked about that filter then sell your squeeze. We were talking about it. It matches water bottle threads. But the problem like with like this bottle specifically is it goes around what, like two and a half, maybe one and a half times around. It's like smart water bottles. This piece is about that long and it's just like much, much better. It's much more secure so it's like more threads threads to, to secure it. So. So there's not gonna be any, any leak or anything. It's crazy to think that that all you have to do is squeeze the water, like how long does it take to do like a, a one liter thing of water and that's the biggest, that's the biggest con with that specific type of filters.

Speaker 2:          01:17:54       The fact that you have to manually do it and it can take awhile. So if you had a group of, let's say you wanted to go with your, with your kids backpacking, like I don't know if I'd recommend that filter because you're gonna have to squeeze all their water through that one little filter, but if it's just you and you're trying to squeeze a half a liter, a liter at a time, like it's fine. You know, might take a minute. I've seen those gravity filters to. Yeah, like who you're going with your family or something and you have to do more volume of water. I'd probably go gravity filter. So here it is right here. Okay. So your squeeze water filtration system, there's a video of it. Oh, okay. And it squeezes into a bag. So you fill the water bottle up and then you squeeze it. And then it fills that bag.

Speaker 2:          01:18:30       So do you use one of those? Um, so the manufacturer bag. Oh, I see. Do you use one of those tubes? Oh, so what is it? What's going on right there? That's the clean water coming out. I see, I see. Oh, so that's it. Huh? So you fill the bag up and he squeezed that thing and then it comes out the end. Wow. It's pretty good stuff. It's amazing that that's all you have to do. I would think there's a bunch of bears shitting in that water. Like what are the odds that you could just do that? Yeah, that's crazy. I think they're marketing more towards like, um, know like Africa and stuff. No. All right. If you get, if you have a water source that's polluted, like you can start to get water for village, you know, it's like just squeeze it through in the head like a warranty of uh, some, some insane amount of water can go through there, you know?

Speaker 2:          01:19:20       And then what do you do? You have to change the filters. Just throw it away and get another one. They're like, I don't know, 40 bucks. I was like, good, another good, another filter every 10 years. That's it. I think their warranty is like, I don't know what to throw out a number, but it's like a million gallons of just something ridiculous. That little thing can go through a million gallons of water. What does that filter smell like after the ads that you're supposed to back flush it. Like my back flows when you back flushed mind. Alright, you got the one way, the dirty water goes through this way and you just push through the crap right out the other way and yeah, when you do that on mine, like it was just black water coming out. Oh, it's interesting to think like all that black water. It's just filtered out of what looks like clean water, clean water in the. Well that is interesting. Well it's also like you ever, like, especially

Speaker 1:          01:20:08       in Los Angeles is a great example of this. Have you ever gone to the hills and look down on the basin of the La area and you see that Brown air? Yeah. That's fucking disgusting. But when you're there, you don't see it. It looks normal. Walking around Hollywood, you're like, oh look air. I can see right through it. Your lungs are doing the same thing that filters dylan like brake dust. That's the other thing. The brake dust apparently is a real issue with New York City and places where you have real congestion in tight areas. You're breathing in a lot of dust from the breaks of the cars. Had no idea. Yeah, I didn't either. Yeah, I saw some of that smoke coming into La and a connected it in Mexico City when I was coming here in Mexico City was the same way. Mexico City was just like worst Mexico cities like la is going to be in probably 20 or 30 years.

Speaker 1:          01:21:00       What's it? What's going on with the politics over here? I figured Joe would be clean air and organic and not much we could do. When you get the volume of people that are here, the amount of humans in La apparently though the base in like especially like the valley has always been like that. It's always been kinda like a dust bowl, just by the way it's shaped even back before there were cars, people always complained about the brown air just from literally from dust and dirt and wind and the dry air and the lack of moisture. So the the dirt kicks up easy with the wind, but then you add that with pollution as well growth. But we have $20, million plus people in this tiny little area. Yeah. You know, I mean literally we have as many people as the entire country of Australia in the La area.

Speaker 1:          01:21:46       That's crazy. Fucking really crazy. There's just too many. And now now that trump has lightened that EPA protection standards and they're, they're changing the standards of automobiles. What automobiles need to achieve. So supposedly to help business, but fuck man. What cost? Yeah. I think that seems like a short term solution to a longterm problems. Terrible idea. Terrible idea. I mean there's a reason why people, why they set those standards and they're trying to achieve cleaner and cleaner standard. So like if you go back, apparently the 19 seventies in Los Angeles, the traffic was, it was pollution was way worse because when you're around those cars you ever been around like old old cars like you know, 1970 car. Not particularly. Now when you're around them, apparently just an old car like that, just sitting around a Po produces pollution, not even driving because the gas tank is not airtight and fucking fumes leak out into the environment, just the oil.

Speaker 1:          01:22:48       Those things are always leaking oil and shit. When they drive, they just traps. That is disgusting. There's just fire. I mean they're basically just burning gasoline is coming out the back and so why are they different? None of that regulations. That's Manhattan from 1966. It's crazy. Yeah. Well that's those old cars, man. Old Cars were fucking terrible and regulations fixed a lot of that stuff. And the upper right hand corner is as Los Angeles, I got that fucking smog in La and it's going to get worse now. Mean he was getting better, but it's going to get worse. I mean, if he really does succeed in lowering the standards, the emission standards. So you're China. China is awful. It's just about to say visioning of you who've been to China. I've watched a documentary literally. I literally like when I was in. This was years ago, but when I was in China I was just like sick, literally sick. Like I was talking with a gravel voice. It's just like people live there, you know, like every day. Yeah, no things. Well that is got to be one thing that's positive about doing the Appalachian trail is that you're constantly in nature and you're constantly around all those trees and the walking through the mountains and the healthy stuff. Yeah. You're drinking like A. I'm not going to say that'll stream waters clean, but I mean, yeah, you're drinking

Speaker 2:          01:24:09       river water, you're surrounded by trees all the time. You're not near city lights, like air pollution. It's pretty. And you're exercising every day, all day, you know, it's pretty healthy way of life

Speaker 1:          01:24:20       in a way. And it lets you start talking about stress fractures. So when you quit your job, you, you didn't just do the Appalachian trail like you, you kind of became a world traveler, right?

Speaker 2:          01:24:32       Yeah. And I still kind of am honestly. Yeah. Um, yeah. Like I'm in Guatemala right now. And um, what are you doing in Guatemala? A working online, you know, I do a lot of green belly online. So you live in Guatemala, kind of a loose term, you know, living, there's like, have you ever heard the term digital nomad? Is that what you are? I don't know if I identify myself as that, but that kind of movement of, of working online and working remotely so I can truly operate most of the business on online. Um, so from that point of view, it's like nowhere is off limits, you know, it's as long as there's decent Internet connection. So, I mean my girlfriend are in Guatemala for three months right now and then we'll be in Europe and then Asia.

Speaker 1:          01:25:17       I can keep an apartment anywhere. Anything AIRBNB. Wow. No possessions. Truly. Wow. You're a renegade. He out there fucking stomach. Your nose. It's society. It's,

Speaker 2:          01:25:31       it's growing movement, man. Like there are a lot of people like you'll go to these cities like ching miles, where it changed my Thailand was where I was pretty much all of last year. Our thousands of, of like young international people like running businesses off their laptop, you know, and I mean there are hubs all over the world, like, like cheering Mai where they'll have these like coworking cafes. It's booming right now. Like people are all over the world, like you know, twenties, 30 year olds just starting off a business just makes a thousand dollars a month income, you know, and then they'll slowly grow into $2,000 a month and you know, next thing he knows they're replacing their old salary at their old gig.

Speaker 1:          01:26:12       Yeah, I know people who've done that in Hawaii. I've heard of people doing that in Hawaii where they moved to Hawaii and try to operate out of there. And you know, you're essentially still in the United States, but you're living in a beach life. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, look, if you can do it, it's probably better than being trapped somewhere.

Speaker 2:          01:26:32       Yeah, no doubt. Yeah. And it's like, no car, no car payments, no mortgage. Like I dunno, I mean, I, I, I like it, I do, you know, I don't know about in a few years about having kids if that's the way to go. Yeah. Um, because I think like some, some sense of stability in an environment would be good. But for now it's fantastic.

Speaker 1:          01:26:51       It's definitely good for the kids. Whether it be you're an adult, you know, it's a different animal, you know? I mean, I think also you get the, a lot of the people that do that kind of stuff, he get really attached to this idea of being free. You could just pull up stakes, throw your shit in a backpack and you're gone. Like, how many bags do you have?

Speaker 2:          01:27:11       One. I literally fit everything into one bag. I have two pairs of shoes.

Speaker 1:          01:27:18       Wow. It was like this,

Speaker 2:          01:27:21       this extreme minimalist living, you know.

Speaker 1:          01:27:24       But I know a guy who does that and he's in his sixties. Steve, my friend Steve Maxwell, personal trainer, was he living name is Trina who live in California, lives everywhere. He doesn't have a place. He's lived in hotels. Yeah. He hasn't had a place since I met him. When I met him, he had a, uh, a van that he lived out of, like a big camper van and he slept in that thing. Then he sold that fucking thing. He's like, I don't need this, and he's just has a bag. He has a bag that's about that big and he gets everything down to that bag. He travels all over the world. Less is more. Yeah. I mean, and he's a guy that's done the opposite. He had a gym and he had a house and the family and the whole deal and his kids grew up. He got divorced. He's like, fuck this life. And just became this kind of nomad type person. You know? It's a fascinating idea that mean people are so attached to the idea of permanence when it's not real. I mean, no matter what happens, you will die. And all this stuff that you've nestled a cohort. Yeah. Feathered your nest with. It's not real. It's like you're not going to keep it white. Amala. Huh? Come on down man. How'd you choose that? Costs like five bucks a year.

Speaker 2:          01:28:36       That's a, that's a plus. Um, yeah, it's, it's close to home. Um, it doesn't have the best of health right now. So I do like the idea of being somewhat a somewhat close to Georgia stuff needed to come home.

Speaker 1:          01:28:47       How far is the flight from Guatemala and the Georgia [inaudible]? Four and a half hours. So you can get. They're almost the same as like living on the east coast and flying to the west.

Speaker 2:          01:28:56       Yeah. And the same time zone. It's, it's cheap and it's like all of these volcanoes around you hike all day long and it's like the coolest thing about that. I'm an antiwar right now in tig was like a, I've, there are several South American cities like this or Central American cities and they have the close to the equator. So you have hot temperature all year long, kind of like a Megas, California. You're spoiled with it, right? Yeah. Um, Antigua specifically is that several thousand feet of elevation. So you have that consistent, whether you're long, however you are. It's not 100 degrees every day. So it's like, um, it's, it's very similar to here. It's like 75 degrees every day. It's like 60 at night. He speaks Spanish when Poquito really I would think you would learn these. Speaks Spanish now. But I know fornia Spanish. My Spanish is horrible.

Speaker 2:          01:29:49       I believe in dead like two months, you know, like I'm not, I haven't, I haven't picked it up. Then I just got back from Cabo and I felt bad that I didn't speak Spanish. I was down there. I tried, you know, I did the whole garage down there just a week but a weekend. Yeah. But I would like, I would think like if you stayed there for any length of time, like I have a friend who has a house there, it keeps house there and they go there every month. Motherfucker can't speak Spanish. That's crazy. Like you should learn their language. No, it's kind of like a guilty, like an American privilege. I got, I'm not going to wait. I was in Thailand for a year last year. I don't know, 10 words in Thai. Wow. That's a shame on me. But it's like, it's a commitment to learn something that fundamentally different, you know?

Speaker 2:          01:30:30       Yeah. Thai especially, it's like no offense to learn a whole new alphabet. Totally. You can't even read it. Right. It's like you gotta start way back to kindergarten until, you know, at least Spanish. You can kind of read letters. Yeah. So yeah, ties like that crazy language. You look at it. It's like, it's almost like, like music, like musical notes or something. Yeah. And it's like, other than being in Thailand, there's no advantage of knowing Thai. No. I don't mean to bash on Thailand, but it's like a Spanish as much more than incentives. Like, okay. A lot of people speak Spanish. That would be a great thing to know. Yeah, that makes sense. Spanish is probably next to English. Maybe the most popular. What is language? Say Mandarin. Maybe that's like a billion people, but I don't know. The numbers in Spanish was huge. That seems like a grind.

Speaker 2:          01:31:20       Learning Mandarin. Oh, Jesus Christ. Then you have to learn symbols. I, they're not even. It's not even letters. Yeah. Fuck right there. Grammar structure, everything. Yeah. How do they text? How to Chinese people text. Oh my God. How do they text? How is it possible? A really. That's a really good point. Why should, why should know this? I should've already asked this question. How do they have I asked this question? Well, I know in Thai you can switch your keyboard and Thailand. They switched their keyboard to. I don't know. I don't, but they don't have the same numbers of queues so I don't even. Yeah. But with Chinese characters and how the fuck

Speaker 1:          01:32:01       would you send a text like, you know, like if you sent a late night booty call was just like emojis, you know, Smiley face here now. Yeah. Smiley face. Hard Dick, exclamation point. Thumbs up. What is this? Oh my God. There they go. They have, they have a text, but how many characters? They just simplify. Okay. What is it? Keyboard look like? What does the Chinese character keyboard on a cell phone look like? Hm. Yeah. But that's a keyboard on a laptop. What about cell phone? Limited amount of keys. How weird. Oh Wow. They have options. Uh Oh wow. Was Korean. Huh? So to piece them together. And make, I'm asking way too many questions. We're not going to get the answers to these either at of all the places that you have visited. Um, why did you choose Guatemala?

Speaker 2:          01:33:10       Uh, close the United States. I'm hiking. Oh, like in a place called Lake, a teat lawn

Speaker 1:          01:33:17       man.

Speaker 2:          01:33:19       Go to lake. A state law in that place is gorgeous. It's like this massive thousand depot thousand foot deep lake surrounded by volcanoes. Just like tiny little villages around there. They were just a little bit of googling and it was kind of like, hey, why not let's go to Guatemala. So did you go

Speaker 1:          01:33:33       as a visit and then decide to stay? Or did you just go say let's see if we can live here for a few months?

Speaker 2:          01:33:39       Yeah, pretty much. Uh, I liked the idea of like going three months at a time. It's enough to kind of like find a gym, find your restaurant's settle into apartment, like doing every few weeks. It's just way too many logistics, you know? Um, so I think we, yeah, we committed, it was like three months down there. I think we're going to commit to eastern Europe for three months and then, uh, yeah, coming back to Asia for three months after the

Speaker 1:          01:34:01       whole expat lifestyle, it takes a very different kind of person, you know, to just say, let's try living in another country. Like when you say fit, find a gym, like what kind of gyms they have in the little village in Guatemala. They did literally

Speaker 2:          01:34:18       you mentioned that they had um, paint buckets with cement and I'm for real with pvcs and like I wouldn't work out there. That was like a teat line, but Antigua's it really did.

Speaker 1:          01:34:28       It's like super ghetto stuff. So they had paint buckets filled with cement that are attached to sticks. Yeah. Literally that's how you worked out. Yeah. Whoa. Yeah. Wow.

Speaker 2:          01:34:39       Um, but in tig was different. That's like a more, it's a bigger town city, like they have a proper gym. We go to yoga classes all the whole, the whole nine yards. Oh. So it's almost like America. It's totally. So when you're using these paint buckets with me, didn't use him. That was only at Laika teat line. So I'm an Antiguan Elica teat. I was only there for a month and lake teat Atlanta is like a, maybe like seven small villages scattered around the lake and um, they're actually indigenous. It's like they're directly Mayan. Oh Wow. Those people. Guatemala interesting is of all the South American Central American countries as the highest percentage of indigenous people. So it's like 30 percent indigenous so they don't even speak Spanish. Whoa. It's crazy. And they like, what do they speak? It's catch a cold kitchen. So is it a Mayan dialect? I believe so. They're totally different people and they dress traditional everything

Speaker 1:          01:35:32       thing. It's intense. Well they have a very strong will. At least mine's did. They had a very strange language where you, it's, it's like, there you go. The letters or the images represent sounds. And so the sounds like, like you, like you would have like an eye. Like this is how a Terence Mckenna described it. You'd have like an eyeball a saw an aunt like a bug and then arose. And that would be the way you say, I saw aunt rose. How do you know this was just from Terence Mckenna? Him talking about it because he's, he, he, he was, uh, he was a crazy psychedelic. Did venture character, do you know Mckenna is? Maybe I should, yeah. He's a fascinating speaker, like a who was a psychedelic lecture. He was a botanist and just did way too many drugs and, or the right amount depending on who you ask.

Speaker 1:          01:36:28       And uh, he got really deep into the mind culture and he was one of those guys that was thinking that December 20, first 2012 is going to be some crazy event, was not necessarily more of a shifting of consciousness because it was a, the end of the long count of the Mayan calendar. Yeah. So, well the Mayan calendar is a really tricky thing, man. Like the sort of various different decipher rings of it and the people that are attached to all these different meanings to it that don't necessarily jive with the original meetings. It was very hard to tell what the Mayans men, because they're not around anymore, you know. So it's not like you're, you're studying ancient Russia where people are rushing scholars and they can. There's a direct lineage between them and the people. Now you know, when you said culture, the language has gone and how we're gonna fix.

Speaker 1:          01:37:18       Yeah, they was. There's like some, some translations it took forever to figure out and there's things that are similar in some ways to a Rosetta stone where they're trying to match up what it used to be, what it is, what we try to figure out how you would say these words in the context of the culture that existed 2000 years ago as opposed to today. Like how would you, Eva, you're talking about the way they viewed things, the way they communicated was incredibly different. That's has an interesting. Yeah, it's fascinating stuff. There was a, there was a great documentary decoding the Maya. That was A. I think it was a nat geo. It sounds like that guy. Fuck I'm going to send you that. Yeah, I think it was. And it just detailed how difficult it was for these people to try to figure out who these symbols and say, all right, what do these mean?

Speaker 1:          01:38:09       What the fuck do they mean? And apparently there was a really recent breakthrough where they found a bunch of, I don't think they called them hieroglyphs, I don't know what they actually call them, uh, but they, they found a bunch of previously undiscovered Mayan language that sort of filled in some pieces that they hadn't, hadn't filled in before. Then you look at some of the amazing murals that looked like a guy seated in a spaceship with fire below his seat and you try to figure out what the fuck this man. Like a lot of those ancient alien alien theorists, right? Oh, you ever seen that one? There's one is a really crazy as it looks like a guy who's leaning back in like a, like a spaceship. It looks like he's leaning back in the cockpit chair and he's looking through something that looks like a telescope and he's moving some, uh, some levers with his hands and it looks like there's fire beneath him. It really bizarre, fascinating stuff. So that was drawn a long time ago. Yeah, there it is right there. That's the. That's the.

Speaker 1:          01:39:17       That's the. I guess there's a go full screen with that one right there that you got right there. Yeah. See, so below him as fire. He sitted he's moving some stuff with his feet. He's moving some levers and you see how he's looking through that thing and it looks like it's got like a gas mask on like an oxygen mask and all those people that like the von Danek and guys like they believed that what this showed was a man sitting in a cockpit using the levers and machines to operate some sort of a spaceship. So wherever that spaceship from most likely it didn't exist. Most likely these guy was for highest fuck on the mushrooms and they're probably imagining the future. I mean if I had to guess, I would say that these ideas were probably very psychedelically based because they were really into psychedelic drugs.

Speaker 1:          01:40:12       They had found a lot of different drugs and a lot of different vines that contained lysergic acid and it's one of the. I had a did a trip to Chichen Itza, which is really cool, bunch of years back and I had a professor that was the guide. It was really cool because you could hire people for a guy. Then we got this guy who was a professor in mine history and he when he knew that I was really into it and I asked all these questions, he was super psyched, so he went way deep into it and we had it for like six hours. He took us on this grand tour, but one of the things he showed us this area of one of the pyramids were they used to do these psychedelic rituals and he was talking about these. They used to take these, these vines that had some sort of lysergic acid in it and they would have these psychedelic rituals and one of the, one of the things they used to do when they were studying the stars and you know, looking at it, obviously no, no light pollution back then.

Speaker 1:          01:41:09       Right? So these guys are tripping their balls out on acid staring at this beautiful star scape. And what's the DNA of the violence still around home and I remember because it was so long ago that I went, I went and like early two thousands, 2002 or something like that. I think we went, but it was amazing. They just think that you're standing on the ground where these people existed and they had this bizarre culture that we don't understand that was aligned to the cosmos. Like the other structures were based on constellations, like the, the maps of these structures mirrored constellations and they were really into a astronomy and some sort of a weird way. Yeah. Oh yeah, right over your head. Like how the fuck did they, they, they apparently there's evidence that they knew about the procession of the equinoxes which is a 20 something thousand year cycle of wobble of the earth.

Speaker 1:          01:42:09       Yeah. Because they see that the earth isn't just spin, you know, it doesn't just spin perfectly. It spins with like a little bit of a wobble. So the night sky changes and it goes into this 26, I think it's 26,000 year cycle. And they apparently knew about that. What, how, how? No, yeah, I guess if you have a lot of time back then and there's no iphone constantly distract you with checking your twitter picture on Instagram, you know, you're instead you just looking at constellations. I just don't know how they would, how they would market, how they, how will they would. I mean, I guess that they would see that there's some sort of subtle changing of the night sky in terms of like how it would move a little bit all the time. Not just move. Obviously the night sky moves with the seasons, you're looking at a different image as the sun moves and this planet spins, but it's just the, the idea that these people had figured out all these different things.

Speaker 1:          01:43:10       Like in terms of like mapping constellations so long ago. Wild. Yeah. Amazing. I just, it's, it's fucked up that we don't know what they were saying. You know, like we've never heard their language. Like it's one of the things about one of these, uh, other documentaries that I watched was that they were trying to mimic what the sound of these Mayan languages could have been like. And they really, it was kind of guesswork, but they didn't know, they can see if there's something that you find or something where they, um, hear what the Mayan language could have sounded like. There was some sort of a really bizarre like clicks or something I them, which is weird language, but they don't even know if that's right because there's no one around total guests. They just died. They just went away, you know, it's, it's weird. And then the language got absorbed and obviously these people that you were talking about probably have some sort of a dialect and.

Speaker 1:          01:44:11       Yeah. And I have no idea what the correlation was between the current descendants in what you're talking about. Yeah. I don't know. I mean, what's really bizarre is it's not that long ago in terms of human history because if you look back and like human history in Europe, like there's places in Europe you can visit that are 2000 years old. I mean, isn't there a fucking bar somewhere in Europe that's like almost 900 years old or something, something crazy like that. So these, I believe that the Mayan civilization they think was not, not more than 2000 years ago. Here it is. Sean's bars, a pub in athlone. Ireland is the oldest pub in Ireland. Goes back to 900. Eight d older than 100 years old. Jesus Christ. Two thousand 900 years old essentially. Oh, 980. Okay. But think about that. That's a thousand. Well, it says oldest pub in Europe.

Speaker 1:          01:45:11       So what's the oldest? The oldest pub in the world? That's a good question. But just think of that 900. Add that. So that's, that's three or 400 years before gingiss con you old trip to Jerusalem. One, 1000. One hundred. $8. 80 nine 8,980. So that seems like the oldest. Yeah it does. And the 900 a day. Wow. More than 1100 years ago. Fucking a man. Just crazy that much older than America. Yeah. So book one was the Mayan civilization when, when was the, was the decline of the Mayan civilization. See if you find that it is pretty amazing when you stop and think about it. Think about just the bizarre history of the human race and that there are these civilizations that have these. They lived and he sort of isolated environments where they developed in many ways parallel sort of building techniques but different than other parts of the world that were also based on constellations.

Speaker 1:          01:46:15       Like very similar to a lot of the hypothesis about Egyptian culture is that they had done that collapse. It goes, wow, 980. That's insane. So right, right on the light. When that bar was built, maybe the bar fucking caused it. They all went to Ireland. Got Hammered. That wow, that's a coincidence that entered a 80 right there. Nine hundred 80 up and down, but what a bizarre and complex civilization the Mayans were. See if you could find out this is what the Mayan language sounded like. I found a, but it's psycho. A woman living currently. It's like, this is what it could have sounded like. I don't know if that's the best one. Let's hear what she says. Let me see what it may be me. Maybe there's some of it left. You know, you could take on anything. I don't know if that's the same. Oh, you could. Yeah. They'll say you could open it. That's where the city near Guatemala. Whoa.

Speaker 3:          01:47:20       Yeah. Maybe doesn't sound like anything that I've ever heard before.

Speaker 1:          01:47:49       Spanish words drugged. It says what you could. Maya sounds really sounds like. What is it? What's the description? So this guy had his housekeeper describe what this older woman was saying. Oh, go back to look at it. It says attention Mel Gibson. Yes. She saw that movie apocalypto and had a hard time understanding the mind that they were speaking in that movie. If you listen closely, you can hear a few Spanish words mixed in where there are no mind words,

Speaker 4:          01:48:16       Huh? Wow. Interesting. Apocalypto.

Speaker 1:          01:48:20       That's really interesting. Maybe he claimed that they were speaking at or something like that or what? That movie, I don't want to get done in apocalypto mean you're talking about a dead language. How could you get a guest to. What did he do with apocalypto? Did he use Spanish? Did he mix it in with stuff? I would imagine that we'd hire some sort of language experts,

Speaker 4:          01:48:41       but

Speaker 1:          01:48:42       what else? He might might've been busy getting drunk and yelling at choose curse curse. Now his ex wife thing that I pulled up off of mental floss is that, uh, if like 15 fun facts about the movie, it says that he was a stickler for authentic language and all of the dialogue is you could take Maya language. So. Oh, well huh. That's where the discrepancy is in that maybe he said he used it all and she's saying I speak it not unrecognized. What she's not saying that she spoke it. If you read what she said she was saying that she had given this woman a massage and the woman was speaking to her and that she recognized a few words in Spanish, but she didn't. Yeah, I don't think there's a bridge between that lag. I don't think there's anybody who knows that language and also speaks English that can crazy man.

Speaker 1:          01:49:29       That whole part of the world is so then you go back to like the in the old macs, they don't even know who those people were. Those strange, almost African looking phases. They, those gigantic stone structures that they found that there could be thousands of years old. Are you talking about off of the coast of Ecuador? Yeah. The old Mac are there almost like a hypothetical situation or, or a, uh, they don't. They don't necessarily know where these people came from. They don't know who they were and some people have said they look a lot like, like really strong featured, um, South American folks. And some people have actually compared the way the old mex were depicted in these structures, these statues and things that they look more like Africans, you know, this has been like speculation that these are people that might have come from Africa on boats.

Speaker 1:          01:50:21       That's been widely criticized too. But the point is they don't really know much about the old Mex. You ever seen images from the seat pull up? I'm old MAC statues o l m e C, I believe it's the way they spell it. But again, that's just phonetic. They don't, I don't even know what language these people spoke and these are. So these are some statues and things that they found in South America. Look at these. Oh yeah. Seen that. He's so. They have different legends of the Hidden Temple. Did you ever see that show? It was a joke. I said that. I thought that was going to pull up the Nickelodeon TV show. Oh No, no. I'm thinking of no. The omex like, look at that one. The third one over from the top. Look at that. I mean that looks very African, doesn't it? We really thick lips. Wide noses, large nostrils. Really interesting. Mean these people, they don't exactly know what their culture was. They don't exactly know who they were. It's hard to carbon date as well because you're dealing with stone so until they find, you know, things that are around there that they can back date. I think that the estimate is 6,000 years.

Speaker 1:          01:51:33       I might've made that up though.

Speaker 1:          01:51:35       See? See if you could find out. Like what? How long ago were the old Mex? The. You could see it back where you just were. What does it say? They're going to be saved? Jesus. Everything is done at RBC. I was 80 they before. Oh yeah. Why am I screwing that up? Dealing with this, I'm in pain right now dealing with this. How's it doing better? But fuck man, I was in Mexico this week and I got severely sunburn on my back. Put sunscreen everywhere. But my back, I've had young Jamie in a very non gateway lather on this. Uh, Aloe Vera Anti. But I'm very distracted. It's just like a, like almost like I have 100 things all over my back. Not No Bueno. So that's 900 BC. They think the old mex lived. What's that estimate based on? Because I saw something that was like, it thought it was there were way older than that. Wonderful. I know the date from at least before 900 BC. That's. See, I think there's like a conventional way of thinking and then there's an alternative theory and the alternative it was that they were way, way, way older than that, but I don't think they know. They don't know who the Omex were,

Speaker 1:          01:52:51       but cool shit, you know, they left behind these giant heads and like, oh why'd you even do that? No one knows. Have you seen that thing? I was watching this one documentary or one television show where either on the Amazon and uh, they've, they've recently because of satellite images found in city while they found what they think are the thing is evidence of hidden cities have evidence of ancient cultures now in the Amazon. Um, and I think it was Brazil, I don't think it was Honduras, but they found, um, like what would appears to be irrigation structures and things that are carved into the ground and things that look like grids where they might've had cities and streets. That was the lost city of gold member there were said last Silverado. Yeah, yeah. The people are looking for. And that one, a European explored, went looking for and wound up dying and they believe it got eaten by cannibals because they're making a movie about that. Right. We talked about this recently, some movie about the lost city of gold that's on its way.

Speaker 2:          01:54:00       I had a, I think it was Disney did one event animation one like 20 years ago. That was a bug.

Speaker 1:          01:54:08       Well, there's always been rumors that there was these lost cities in the Amazon, but now thanks to satellite imagery, they're starting to see things they never saw before and starting to find patterns and structures and it's cool shit man. His cool. Well it's what's really crazy is like if we didn't have this stuff, like how long would it be before there was no evidence, would it be another thousand years? So like how if you go back to when was, when were these structures with they 2000 years old, were they a thousand years old? So if we, if we think about it like who knows what was there in the Amazon, who knows what was their 5,000 years ago, 10,000 years ago. I mean it could have been completely lost civilizations that we just, we'll never know. We'll never have any awareness of

Speaker 2:          01:54:55       you freaking out, man. Look at you. I'm never to know.

Speaker 1:          01:55:00       Do you have any plans other than you said you were going to visit Eastern Europe. He lived in Guatemala. Now you're going to live there for awhile and do you have any other like wild plans and places to go and

Speaker 2:          01:55:09       uh, talking about Thailand again at the, uh, at the end of the year? Um, other than that, no, that's, that's about as far ahead as I thought. I mean honestly, like I, I came to my buddy was in Ohio, I don't know if you. Oh, hi. It's a town. Yeah. Yeah. Um, and we went into surfing yesterday, up there and I was just like, I liked it and we were surfing around lunchtime and then we went for a hike in the afternoon. It's just gorgeous. I mean it's like the fact that you can go surfing in the day and then for a, I'm in a gorgeous. You could look like these trails just snake on forever. I was like, California

Speaker 1:          01:55:44       was like, okay, maybe California is on the radar. California is pretty bad ass. Yeah. Northern California is really intense, like the rain forest area where the redwoods are. Have you been up there yet? Yeah, I've been up there. Those big, this big red was this gorgeous Pacific northwest. Looks beautiful too. I've never been up there. Yeah, it is. It's really interesting and super dense. Forest up there, like really dense because it's constantly raining. And what's really interesting about the forest is the other so many pine trees and there's so many leaves fall at the forest floor is really soft. Yeah. He like, yeah, like you're stepping on this cushion everywhere you walk. It looks beautiful though. It is a lot of ferns and [inaudible]. Yeah, it's very, very alive. What do you do if you have hunted up there before? Uh, I also went up there looking for bigfoot.

Speaker 1:          01:56:33       That TV show that I did. You did? Yeah. Yeah, we went, we went big foot hunting up there for a week. Did you find them? We found a lot of white guys out camp and looking for bigfoot. Really? Yeah. It was a joke that I said, here's what you don't find when you go looking for bigfoot. Black people are more likely to find big foot. Then you are black people looking for big bunch of white guys camping. He's accurate. And it was interesting because one of the guys that we've talked to is like, hey look, even when we don't find anything least we're out here camping. I was like, Eh, that's the worst case scenario is pretty good. But there's a lot of people out there that claim they seen things but I just think they're seeing bears because there are bears up there, there's a lot of black bears up there and you see them in the distance and bears do walk on two legs all the time.

Speaker 1:          01:57:16       And I think if you see one in the distance and you see that image and you convince yourself that that's bear or that's a big foot rather not a bear. And after awhile your memory starts to memories are so bad. Like the human memory. So in inherently shitty. I mean a few people have like very clear distinct memories from the past. But I think even though you're sort of repeating them to yourself and ingraining them in your head until you believe it until you believe him. But I think like what, what our memories are good for is like recent events or things that are catastrophic, like don't go near the snake, the snake will kill you. You know that spiders got venom. Oh, I remember the spider, you know, but like as far as like seeing things and being around especially unusual events that are very unique, like seeing a seven foot tall monkey in the woods or believing you saw that thing.

Speaker 1:          01:58:04       Yeah, no doubt. I think he's seen as a, the studies of the hub, like a criminal break into a room and then they'll ask all the other witnesses how tall was he? Like was he black? Was He white? Like all these specific characteristics and like they're all over the place. Yeah. Yeah. Human memory is unbelievably bad and we count on it so much and people are always like telling you stories about their childhood. I remember when this hub and he was like, do you really? How much do you really remember? It's like, you might really. And how delusional are you? That's the other part of the problem. Like how, how much do you remember of things like what is, how much do you distort reality to her to fit within your narrative that you enjoy? Make a good story, right? Yes. Enjoy. Yeah. You must run into a lot of those people when you're out there on the, on the hat, as it were, was this sasquatch chased dear onto highway woman tells deputy wow.

Speaker 1:          01:58:57       She sounds pretty fucking legit. She's 1550 year old tents. It was tented tensed. It's the city. I guess 10 said woman. Fifty years old. She's probably on pills. Whacked out of her mind. Maybe drunk. No. No, so, so legit dude. But it's an Idaho again. Idaho high bear population. I know. I was fucking grizzly bears. It's probably out there, whacked out on fucking pills. She sees a bear. She can't wait to call the police. Finally, my life has meaning. Had 50 years old. I'm the first one in my town. It's a big. She goes and tells people. Did you run into any wildlife? It was weird when you're out there.

Speaker 2:          01:59:37       I don't know if bears are considered weird, but yeah, embarrassed. There was, um, it was 2013. They were like, you know, Congress seems to shut down about once every decade for budget disagreements. Yeah. In 2013 they shut down. And um, uh, yeah, so they shut down the whole national park system. So you eat, he goes through a lot of national parks. So when they should have the national park system, nobody's allowed to go into the park, meaning. So it's like, what the hell are we supposed to do? Even hiking for four months and now you're just going to say you can't go through these sections. So it ended up everybody just kind of kept on hiking, but the ranges would kick you out. So she had to do is you'd hike at night. Oh God, I'm. So you're hiking at night. But the best thing about hiking unite as a wildlife, you know, because it's like you start.

Speaker 2:          02:00:23       And so like specifically Shenandoah national park, um, it gets a ton of visitors. And so when they shut down the national park, the only people in there were us. It was like three hikers for this 100 mile section of park. So it was like, and the Shenandoah national park, I believe is one of the highest concentrated black bird populations in the country. Oh Jesus. So you have like no disturbance and you have all these barriers. So, um, you know, we'd be hiking the night I was actually alone, um, at this point. But um, yeah, I was hiking through the night one night and yeah, like the sun was rising and you know, like a bear's will go to sleep at night and the trees and when you pass by them you triberr and they'll come out of the tree and the claw their way down the tree and you know, it's a slow their fall.

Speaker 2:          02:01:11       But it was like, I think I saw 15 beers that morning. I was just cool though. It was cool. It was just like, now when you're hiking a using headlamps, are you just going by the moonlight or both? I mean, yeah, moonlight if you can. Uh, it's surprising like your, you know, your eyes adjust and the night I have a lot of times, but if you're under like heavy trees, you know, that's not going to work. But yeah, hadn't headlamps. Definitely. And how long was Congress? How long did they shut down? And national parks. I remember who went too long. There was a couple weeks something. I mean some hikers we knew like literally holed up in a hotel for a couple of weeks until they settled it committed. It's just like, what is a range of really gonna arrest you and throw you in jail for like hiking a through hiker, like hiking through the park. It's weird that they tell you you can't go anymore. I mean, isn't this like public lands? I think we all kind of rolled her eyes are most of us rolled our eyes at it like. All right dude, come on. I'm just, I'm just walking through here, you know. So

Speaker 1:          02:02:05       this company that you have, um, green belly meals, which I've enjoyed these things very much. You, you came up with this because you needed more nutrition while you were out there. It's hard to find good stuff to eat.

Speaker 2:          02:02:18       Yeah, exactly. Um, and prior to the ato is doing, um, I was the of the term cycle touring. You've like backpacking on a bike, you hop on a bicycle and you cycle, you know, 5,100 miles a day and then you camp out at night. So did that New Zealand for three or four months and it was the same thing. It's just like burning a ton of calories. Men, um, and I needed everything to be light and ready to eat, um, and then yet came over to the states and right after that trip on the Appalachian trail and the backpacking food consisted of, you know, those dehydrated freeze dried meals that you add hot water to, um, those things like I don't like stopping and cooking at all, you know, like if I can keep going, particularly at meals like lunch, just keep going. Um, and like the meal options were bars, other bars, bars usually cap out at like 200 calories, 250 even meal replacements.

Speaker 2:          02:03:12       The, the highest calorie meal replacement bar on the market. Um, it was a 400 calorie, uh, I believe met Rx, you know, some of those workout, a high protein bars. Um, and not to mention that like heavily processed, you know, I was like, I just didn't want to put up much of that crap in me. Um, and I mean to add another thing was the just balanced nutrition. Some bars would have fiber, some, wouldn't someone have protein, some wouldn't. Someone have carbs and witnessed like, dude, I need nutrition. Like I'm, I'm really burning up to five to 6,000 calories a day, you know. Um, so that kind of idea of, of the need for a big nutrition ready to eat fast, um, you know, kind of eaten, go kind of meal with something that had been forming in my mind is I hiked a lot of times we were drinking olive oil practically and drinking honey and drinking peanut butter. It's just like anything you could get to load in the calories. So I'm, you know, I'm not a big dude so I was like I couldn't afford to lose that much weight and I was losing weight. I'm so green belly kind of came up with the idea when I was hiking. Like, let's make something that packs in some calories, you know,

Speaker 1:          02:04:13       pack. How did you do that though? How did you like these things are super dense, like for people that are listening, I'm holding this bag and as two bars in it and a dude I eat, I've eaten these before. I've eaten two bars and I'm good for fucking a day, just a normal day. Like not hiking or anything crazy, but it's really dense. They're heavy, like you hear that phone. So it's a brick of food. Like how did you figure out how to do that?

Speaker 2:          02:04:44       Uh, I knew nutritionally I had an idea of where I wanted it to be or you know, as a concept for like this kind of ultimate backpacking meal. Um, and then I worked with a food scientist, so I knew that I knew nothing about nutrition. I just kind of knew I wanted to scratch my own itch, you know, I had an itch and I wanted a, I wanted a better backpacking meal. So I knew conceptually what I wanted it to be. And then after playing around my mom's kitchen trying to get something, I was like, this is way over my head, you know, like trying to get the nutritional nutritional profile where I want it to be good at, to taste good, like ingredients that don't react with each other and spoil and then trying to get it to literally form together and not fall apart.

Speaker 2:          02:05:25       It's like you start like having this really complicated stuff as I try to just find her, you know, um, search around and see, you know, what kind of person who can help me. I was looking right in nutritionists and chefs and all that kind of stuff and ended up coming with the term food scientists and food scientists helped me really formulate the meal. And then, um, you know, then it was just kind of a feedback game from what he could do a from a nutritional point of view from a shelf life and flavor profile. Then it was just making sure the darn things tasted good, you know? Um, so I went to like a hiking festival, handed out hundreds of samples, just got a bunch of feedback from hikers and then um, yeah, kind of ran with it and um, yeah, that's been doing well.

Speaker 1:          02:06:07       Well, they're good man and I eat them all the time. So, uh, I, I'm a, I'm a, I'm, I'm impressed. I really delicious. You know, my favorite one is a chocolate one though. Was that which one?

Speaker 2:          02:06:18       Dark chocolate? Yeah, dot dot.dot banana. Yeah. We have been in chips and then, but

Speaker 1:          02:06:21       good shit dude. Real Scott. I'm trying to stay on a ketogenic diet. A funny joke. I was like, yeah man, we got, we got high carbs. Yeah, that's not going to work on a cheat mail. These are good. Or if I'm desperado for food, but also she, you can think about a ketogenic diets as you can every now and then fuck up as long as you're not, you know, as long as you're pretty consistent with a high fat content diet. And then what I'll do is I'll take an exogenous ketone can take a like, drinks that you mix up that put you in a ketogenic state even after you could drink like a whole coca cola and then drink one of these key to genic drinks and it knocks you back in a state of ketosis. Well, yeah, it was pretty scientific shit. This guy, dom d'agostino invented it.

Speaker 1:          02:07:06       He's a scientist at the University of Florida. Interesting. Yeah. There's, there's ways you can manipulate your metabolism that way where it specifically burns fat. There's a lot of benefits. One of the big benefits is your, um, your appetite. Appetite suppressants amazing because if I go on and I did, I do switch over, like if I cheat, like if I go on vacation or something like that and I just started eating tacos or whatever. When you, uh, your body goes into carbohydrate burning state, you way hungrier, like you burned through that carbohydrate pretty quickly. It's quick burning fuel and then your body doesn't have the carbs anymore. So then you go into this real hungry state. Whereas if you're in a ketogenic state, your body's burning fat, you're eating fats, and then when there's no more food, your body starts burning it's own fat, and so you don't get that crazy hunger craving that you get when you're in a car based Diet and there's, you know, there's arguments for both sides and um, I'm going to bring in some people that, uh, are anti ketogenic diet as well, so get

Speaker 2:          02:08:06       balanced perspective on it. I listened to 'em, I don't remember his name, but it was a nutritionist. He had written a book. He was on your podcast a while ago. [inaudible] Chris crusher. Gary tobbs the case against sugar. Please not a nutritionist. This is pretty recently. Robb wolf real recently. I wanna say it was real recent wired to eat robb wolf. That sounds, that sounds right, rob. But the level of nutrition that, that guy knew, I was fascinated. That's rob. Yeah, that must be wrong, man.

Speaker 1:          02:08:35       Whoa. That was impressive. He's the actual guy that invented the concept of quote unquote bulletproof coffee that got kind of stole it. Robb Wolf's concept came first and he wrote about it in 2005, the idea of adding mct oil and butter to give healthy fats with coffee. Yeah. Rob is a scientist and he's. He's like way ahead of the curve.

Speaker 2:          02:08:56       June and oppressive like Kilz conversation was just interesting.

Speaker 1:          02:09:00       Yeah, there's a lot of those guys out there now. It's really a fascinating time when it comes to nutrition and and also what he was really good about him is he's constantly experimenting. He's very honest and very open about his experiments and he's also really adamant about the possibility, not the, not the hospital, but the reality rather that people are very different and everyone's variability. The variability is very wide. So like what is healthy for you might not necessarily be healthy for me. And what, what changes your blood sugar levels is not going to change mine.
