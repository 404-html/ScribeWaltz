Speaker 1:          00:00:05       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:00:06       We're good. Yeah. Ladies and Gentlemen, please welcome Peter Boghossian. Hello. Thanks everybody. Thanks for doing that. Appreciate it man. I good. I think I found out about you through Sam Harris. I'm not sure, but, uh, you're also friends with my friend rory singer. Oh, Roy, he's a great guy. Great Guy. He got excited when he found out that you were coming on. Roy, of course, uh, martial artists, a former UFC fighter. Right. And, uh, kept me many times. I'm sure he taught me many times too. So you, you're, uh, you, you work at, um, University of Portland State, Portland state. Yeah. Work Portland state, teach philosophy there. And you're also a guy who is your, you described as an atheism advocate, like not just an atheist, but someone who actively promotes, hey, you should probably try this. Um, I promote critical thinking and reason and rationality and I, and the two go together.

Speaker 2:          00:00:59       Yeah. And I think that naturally leads to to atheism if people are honest with themselves. And, um, and you know, you mentioned rory. Uh, I've been a longtime martial arts my whole life actually. Really? What did you start off with? The fantasy based martial arts? The bullshit. Like which ones? Uh, I did everything. I mean I did, I tried Kempo I tried, I literally tried if you were to put all of the emotional arts together that don't work and put them into one suite, I tried them, all of them. Well Campos got some good striking techniques. They just don't have a, an overall comprehensive system to deal with grappling. Yeah, I tried [inaudible] I tried taekwondo. I tried, uh, I tried tai cheese so I tried them all. And then I actually, one of my turning points was when Ron van Cleef, who was in the original UFC as early UFC, he was in like ufc three or four or something like that early on.

Speaker 2:          00:01:56       And he was like in his fifties he was older. He's in still in very good shape. He, he liked competed in a tournament, a karate tournament I think deep into his sixties. Yeah, I trained with, with Ron and I trained with this guy, she on Hector Santiago who was quite something and I trained with them for years in New York City. And when Ron van cleef got taken down and just dominated, that was a huge moment for me. That was then I then that started me on this whole other path. And then I trained with Greg Jackson for New Mexico. Will you in New Mexico? Yeah. W having there, I've trained, I started in New York City before the UFC came, came along and I trained there and then I trained in New Mexico and now I train with Matt Thornton from straight blast. Uh, his John Calvin, ours coach who's obviously conor mcgregor and, and Nelson's that's, that's a great lineage man. So you saw Ron van cleave get dominated by hoists, gracie? Yeah, like fairly easily. It was kind of interesting watch like a guy

Speaker 3:          00:03:00       who is this ledge really, really well respected in the karate. We're whole legend. Legend. Smoked like a beginner. Yeah. And I saw those guys, like I saw Hector Santiago fight in real life and he is a very dangerous person. You saw him fight like in a street fighter. So I used to live in the lower east side between a and B and a d. So, so all of this, this was just part of my, my experience and I thought a lot of this stuff was real and it just turned out to be fantasy. It just turned out to be make-believe. Well, I think that's an interesting parallel. When we were talking before the podcast, we're talking about critical thinking and Brazilian Jujitsu and martial arts in general, and there are a lot of people that have very distorted ideas of many things, not just of their ability to handle themselves physically, but just of the world in general.

Speaker 3:          00:03:50       And I think martial arts sort of highlights a lot of that curriculum, those critical thinking issues. Yeah, and I think that's, that's one of the reasons that I was so excited to come on this podcast today is because I think you are ideally situated to have it have that conversation with me because Jujitsu, Brazilian Jujitsu, specifically alive in his training, training against resisting opponents, we don't talk about, this is a huge area that nobody is talking about. We can understand all of reason and rationality through Jujitsu, through corrective mechanisms, through aligning your beliefs with reality. I mean little things from, you know, testing ideas yourself, not having to take it on faith. I just talking to 'em as talking to uh, uh, uh, cause the name eludes me now. I think, I think that there's something Chris harder I think is super good guy. Great Guy.

Speaker 3:          00:04:43       Yeah. Yeah. There's something in the process. So, so you've been tapped thousands of times. Sure. Um, probably if I counted them all up yet, I've been tapped to do something about the type of person who would either if you frame it in terms of subjecting yourself to that, there's something about that that's fundamentally differentiates us, if you will, from people in fantasy based martial arts. It develops a kind of character, develops a kind of attitude when you placed yourself in situations and get tapped. It's, it's a type of a corrective mechanism. Jujitsu is a corrective mechanism. It can help you align your beliefs with reality. And, and I, I'd love to explore that with you today and talk about what that means just in the case that some people might not know what that means. We mean by tap is submit. Um, when you do Jujitsu, I believe it or not, I've talked to, I assume that people know what we're talking about, but I've talked to people go, okay, what is Jujitsu? Like what are you doing? What? Submission? Grappling, which has a Jujitsu is one style of it, but it's all about using leverage and technique, uh, against joints or chokes against arteries like choke holds, uh,

Speaker 2:          00:05:58       to cut off the blood to your brain or neck cranks. And when you train Jujitsu as opposed to other martial arts other than wrestling, which I consider martial art, you can go full speed on that. You Go, you go 100%. And that's the difference between those martial arts and striking based martial arts where you really shouldn't go 100% because you only have so many punches your head can take before your body just stops working. That's just a fact. You could train sparring hard for, you know, a certain amount of years, but you're gonna, you're gonna, you're mind is going to turn into mush. There's just no doubt about it. We know that for a fact. And people do Jujitsu into their sixties and yeah. Oh yeah. Well Anthony Bordain didn't even start until he was 58 and he's obsessed. He trains every day. He goes sometimes twice a day I'll take a private in the morning and then he'll train in a group class after that.

Speaker 2:          00:06:50       He's a maniac. Um, but the difference being like you absolutely know what works and doesn't work and you absolutely know how good people are. So if we rolled, you can't fake it. Yeah. If we rolled 20 times and you tapped me 18 of those 20 times, you know, and if someone said, how good is Peter? I'm like, he taps me most of the time. And then we know we have no, they all, you sit in that case. But yeah. Well, you know what I'm saying? We know it's clear. Yeah. And so you can't fake it. There's no pretending. There's no bullshit. But I know like bowing rituals and masters and all this nonsense, all of those structures I think are put in place to conceal the underlying paucity of the effectiveness of the techniques. And people come up with this. So the other thing about that that that I think is so important is that all of these combat based martial arts, I've been waiting for this conversation for all of those combat, these combat based martial arts.

Speaker 2:          00:07:48       Let's take a look at, you mentioned wrestling. We know it works. We know there are some things we just know that they work. We know the kickboxing works. We also know that it's head trauma for kickboxing. We know that Moitai, which is in my opinion and insane activity, but we know that it works. We know that Western boxing works. We know that Jujitsu works, so the reason that we know we can test these things, we can take people and hopefully later on we'll talk about the difference between Brazilian Jujitsu and Japanese Jujitsu, right? Same techniques, different pedagogy, different training method. That's a $2 word for training method. We can take that. We can adjudicate these things because we take two people of equal weight and we stick them in a cage and we have some very basic rules and also for your listeners who aren't from there, mma gloves are very thin. You know, I think people who don't understand mma, they think that they're kind of like boxing gloves. They are very, very thin gloves that they don't afford much protection at all. Really led the person punch you harder so they don't have to worry about breaking their hand. But as far as like cushion to your brain or your head, yeah, they're not a cushioning. Yeah. So, so we can look, we can judge what works.

Speaker 3:          00:08:56       And the one of the ways that we do that is to people same size, put them in a cage and we see what works. The other thing is that when you train against a resisting opponent, and I think this is the key, you can figure out what's real. Like that's a mechanism. It's a corrective mechanism. It's a way for you to discern, make, believe land and reality. Bullshit, reality. You know, w what, what works and what doesn't work. And once we start introducing that in systems like, look, let's say that I said to you, Hey, I've, I've come up with this technique. Uh, I know this is going to sound crazy, but it's incredibly effective. And you say, what is it? And I say, it's a pinky blitz creek. I got a lot like they're gonna use it. And so I said this, they said, well, attacking with pink.

Speaker 3:          00:09:43       Yeah. I say, you know, but it's a certain, you know, stance and I do this right. You know, come Bantus stance where, and you said, really? And so you call up, unbeknownst to me, you call up, you know, like I heard her show you're buddies with Eddie Bravo right now he's called me and say, look, we got this guy in here. He says that he has this technique, p picky blitzkrieg I'm going to send them over there, put them up against your good purple belt, getting on video and we'll see what happens. So it's, it's a way to test it now. Now if that works, you'd be like, Holy Shit. Like I can't, this is awesome. Like we, nobody ever thought of the pinky blitzkrieg it's incredible. But what you've done there is you, that's a core component of critical thinking. It's a willingness to revise your beliefs.

Speaker 3:          00:10:27       It may sound like bullshit, but you're completely open to the possibility. If this works against a resisting opponent, right? So let's say that I tap out his tap out his, uh, purple belts, and you're like, all right, well, Brown belt. At some point, it would be so absurd that you'd think that Eddie and I were in on it, right? I don't know the guy, I've never rolled them, never met him. So He'd call someone else, but, and then you can test it so you can watch it. Eventually you can test it with your friends. So this idea of testability and people can figure out things for themselves. They don't have to go on the history of the tradition. You know, some guy punched a bull in the head or there was a blind nun walking through this and she killed all these guys. But that's when we always had to deal with that was that was the history of martial arts was always muscle yama and killed a bull with a banshee.

Speaker 3:          00:11:11       We always hear about Maslow Yama. Who was this? Was He kilkee Shin or I think it was coke cushion. Right? So his lineage, I don't, I don't remember, but he was a famous Japanese guy who apparently had killed a bull right punch. Which, uh, and then that, that, that, that comes down as legends. So when people said, well, you know, how do you know this works? Why should do it? Well, this guy killed a bull. Well, did you see the bull did, did you see it? So, so it's uh, it's a fable and the fable takes on a life of its own. And the, the, the genius about the ultimate fighting challenge was then you had a way to test ideas, right? You can literally watch these things unfold against people of, in

Speaker 2:          00:11:53       the early ones, your people have different weight classes. They had the sumo wrestler and the kickboxing guy. So, but not only that, it was an opportunity for you to figure out what was real, right? And there's something that's incredibly appealing to that. Like think about, think about Kata, right? What a fucking waste of time. Like not only is it a waste of time in terms of let's say what Kata is, it's like, you want to go. Yeah. And so it's, we'll their forms and what a form as it's like a pattern of movement that you, that everyone does. You'd get one when you get your white belt, you practice that and you get really good at it. You do it for a task to get your yellow belt. And in a lot of traditional martial arts, that is part of how you test. You know, I, I got my black belt in taekwondo and I had to remember all those goofy moves and they never came into play ever.

Speaker 2:          00:12:47       When I competed they were, there were no sort of nonsense. It was a waste of time. And as soon as I did get my black, I forgot all of them, barely remember it. It's a waste of time. But I'd argue it's even worse than a waste of time. If it were just a waste of time, then you know, you could have been staring at a wall, but you thought that you were doing something to help you achieve a goal and the goal was to win a fight. So you thought you were engaged in activity, that the whole, there's no resisting opponent. So when there's no resisting opponent, it's not a tea, it's not testable. You can't bring the tools of science too. Right. So, so you thought you were engaging in activity that brought you closer to your desired objectives, but it didn't. Here's the argument against that though.

Speaker 2:          00:13:36       The what it does do is it helps your precision movement and you could argue that learning how to execute these patterns in a very beautiful way shows control and it, and it shows precision movement. They aren't, the problem with it is that there's some of those movements that are completely ineffective like double knife, hand block or thrusts, knife hand thrusts is, there's movements that are there, the not applicable to mma. But the concept behind it is actually something that a lot of really good mixed martial arts like Carlos condit or even conor mcgregor are doing. They're doing a lot of like movement training. And um, although I don't think Kata is the best way to achieve those kinds of goals. Yeah, I think that there's something to be said for not just martial arts techniques, but other things as well. Like Yoga I think is extremely effective in enhancing your ability to, um, to control and manage your body in the movements. All right. She's a weird strength. So we're on the same page. So think about it. I'd offer a constructive way to think of it like this. So what you just said, I don't know anything about basketball. So I'm going to just use basketballs stamp. There's a ball and a net and black eyes and then that's

Speaker 3:          00:14:52       the court. So, so, so I'm like guys, when when you think about basketball, what you just described was a guy on a court practicing a lay up over and over again. I think a layup is like when you bounce it and you shoot, you don't know the law. I don't know anything about basketball. So I'm like your run up to the fan, you run, throw the ball and then whole and everybody gets crazy. Okay. But think about, don't think about caught. So you, so I think thinking about caught to like a layup in terms of precision is the wrong way to look at, look at it. Think about Catia as a layup without a basketball. Think about the practice of basketball practice, quote unquote a basketball without a basketball. Right. Okay, here's the problem with that. What about shadow boxing? Shadow boxing is extremely effective and shadow boxing in a sense is a form of Kata shadow boxing and w including not just boxing but kicking and punching and needing is a long, long excepted.

Speaker 3:          00:15:51       Excellent form of training and visualization. Yeah. So, so one of the things that shadow boxing you can do, you can warm up was shadow boxing. When I, when I woke up in Git and just to be upfront, I, I suck. I've been doing it for a long time, but I'm not very good. I just felt or I love it. Blue Belt. So I'm not how long you've been doing. I'm not, I'm tell you it'd be ambassador. Tell me since 1999 how dare you, you're still a blue belt. Um, how often do you do it? Well only once a week if I'm lucky. Oh, okay. You gotta go Anthony Bourdain's tag. You got to get obsessed. Yeah. I just don't have a lot of opportunities. Like I have a family that I pushed forward. I have a work career and I have either you have a life, a life.

Speaker 3:          00:16:32       Yeah. I'm fucking people with their lives. Yeah. So you know I'm not, I'm not speaking about it from any kind of like, you know, I'm an expert in this. I understand what you're saying. But I think what's interesting about this is the philosophical implications. And so like, like when I woke up, I like to warm up with another body to slow roll, you know, I like to just, because then I have an opponent. If you're practicing something over and over again, the problem with that is there's no corrective mechanism. You could be doing the technique incorrectly and then when you actually go to execute it, you've had a body memory for that technique that hasn't, that's been, that's taking you away from your goal. Do you mean with striking you mean mean shadowbox and when you use these samples shadowboxing, just so you're saying with shadow boxing that you, you need another body in order for it to be effective. No, I'm saying that like, so let's say that you shadow box a hammer punch. Okay, so stuff that doesn't work like Catia, things like double knife hands. If you, even if you, if you a shadowbox jabs and crosses and upper cuts and stuff, even if you do that, if you could not be doing it correctly and then you'd be practicing the wrong thing over and over again and that will take you away from your goal. That's why you need, you have to have some kind of a resisting opponent. Resisting

Speaker 2:          00:17:50       opponents are the corrective mechanisms for everything and just as the, they're the correct of mechanisms in the physical domain. Did the corrective mechanisms in the cognitive and intellectual domains as well. That's why prayer is so insidious. It's because people think that they're, they're doing something that's in their own wellbeing. They're doing something that's good, but they're just talking to themselves. But there is some aspects and I would agree with, I don't know if I would, I don't like labels. I have a real hard time with labels, even labels for things that I think are good things like I think that some people get a lot out of prayer and not necessarily because they're praying to a nonexistent deity or they really truly believe that if they wish for a new car it's going to come to them, but I think that the mind when focused on positive thinking and and and focused on love and focused on that, the tenants of Christianity let go of God godly behavior and compassion and all these different things and you truly are looking out for your fellow man and wanting to be a good person.

Speaker 2:          00:19:00       All those things. I think there is merit in that. I think you can, you can, you can certainly find benefit in that as a tool for mental management. I mean does that mean there's a guy in the clouds with a harp and all that jazz? Of course not, but I think that it's in a sense like like Tai Chi. I mean, if a guy thinks that he's going to take Tai Chee only and get into the UFC, uh, it's hilarious. He's going to get fucked up. But if a guy in the UFC, like conor mcgregor for instance, who's so concentrated on movement really gets involved in Tai Chi, I think he would probably get at least some benefit out of it because in that slow moving, this like rhythmic pattern, what you're doing is you're exercising your body in an unusual way and expanding the possibilities of, of your, your, your interactions with opponents, expanding what your body can and can't do.

Speaker 2:          00:19:53       And I think yoga does that. I think there's a lot of different things. So we need that. There are about 20 really interesting things that you just said. I think we need to kind of unpack those a little bit. Like, so if you talk about you to take a look at prayer and what people think that they're doing, and then let's, this is why you're the perfect person is talking to this about, uh, then compare that to a martial art. That's bullshit, right? Like Tai Chi is a good example. Okay, so people think that they're going towards a certain end winning fights. It's certainly, I don't know about now anymore, but certainly some people that teach Tai Chi and even practice Tai Chi that are just doing it for their health. Yeah. My Dad is one of those people, so he has zero ambitions to win a fight with anybody. He's in his late seventies so if somebody says that, I have no problem with that at all and I think it's true in Mo motion

Speaker 3:          00:20:48       would be better than non motion and the prom is exactly the same problem with religion. When people are making objective claims, they're making claims about the nature of reality and I want to know what's true and we don't even, the problem is that people, every time you talk about faith, the religion or have you people shut down or they have barriers, we don't need to talk about that. All we need to do is talk about Jujitsu. That's why this is so perfect because with Jujitsu you can figure things out yourself with, you can figure out what works, right? The pinky blitzkrieg you can figure out what doesn't work. You can figure out what you're capable of. If, if I tap you, if, if you tap me out 20 times, I'm under no illusions that the 21st time, I mean I could get lucky, you know, like I could get lucky against rory, I could get lucky against Matt Thornton. It's always possible I could get, it's highly unlikely, but I could get lucky. The problem is that if you look at the way that people engage these rituals in their lives, what these people are doing is it, they think it's taking them towards an end. It's exactly identical to fantasy based martial arts. They think it's taking them towards an end. It's not right. I think also a parallel like in fantasy based martial arts, the benefits of it. Like

Speaker 4:          00:22:08       I was, like I said, I did taekwondo for a long time and uh, I got really good at it and then competed a lot. And uh, I was essentially in a cult. I mean, taekwondo a, although it's a beneficial called and it helped me a lot and it made a lot of ways and made me the person that I am today because in training and doing really difficult things and competing and overcoming nerves and all that stuff, there's a lot of benefit in it. But then, um, I had a distorted perception of reality because of it. And that distorted perception of reality was shattered once I started boxing. Exactly. And I realize like, oh my God, I was getting punched in the face. I didn't know. I thought I knew how to fight when really I just knew how to do taekwondo. Right. And then I had to learn all the other aspects of martial arts.

Speaker 4:          00:22:51       Like one of the most sobering moments of my life was when I, I trained at Carlson Gracie's in, um, on, on Hawthorne, in Hollywood in 1996. And this is before Vito Belfort made his debut in the UFC. And, uh, I, you know, I had this long, extensive history of competing and taekwondo tournament and I had kicked boxed and, uh, I'd done quite a bit of a boxing training and a, I wrestled in high school. I thought it was pretty good martial artist and I just got fucking mall. So like I had never exercised. Like I had no idea what I was doing. And I just remember the feeling of helplessness and the guy who, one of the, I mean, a bunch of people mauled me, but one of the guys at mauled me I'll never forget, is this Brazilian kid who was a purple belt who was basically my size. He wasn't any bigger than me. And he wasn't like some Super Mario Sperry blackbelt guy. Yeah. He

Speaker 2:          00:23:46       was just some guy just beat the fuck out of me. I mean, he's almost disdainfully and he was a nice guy, but I mean, when he was training, he was training really hard and he didn't give me any slack. It was just getting wrecked. And I remember thinking, wow, what a stupid illusion I was under. Yeah. And, and, and so in a sense, I think it's, I mean, I guess that's a question we could talk about, but I know is it incumbent upon us to help people out of these traditional martial arts? Like I did a, I had a very similar experience. I trained in stick a knife fighting for years. That's why my hands cuts. Yes. Grima that's why my my hands have all these cuts and are all married with real knives, real knives and sticks. Yeah. I did the stuff with the dog brothers and Dan Medina was, I've got a black belt and stick a knife fighting and, and you know, I'm thinking about black belts and sticking a knife.

Speaker 2:          00:24:32       Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Well, I mean, if you're in a place where the bullets are all gone and no one knows how to make a gun, well, bows and arrows haven't been invented. That's where I was going to go with this. Where I was going to go with this is I, I, uh, so I thought it was a pr like you, I thought I was pretty good martial artist. Right. And then, uh, I fought a guy fight, actually great Jackson with sticks and just beat the shit on them. And I mean I had a stick and I had been training with the stick for like years at that point. And it was just a huge wake up call from you guys fought like in the competition we fought in like a fight fight and, and I, he had only on fight fight. You were mad at each other?

Speaker 2:          00:25:11       No, like uh, you know, like a party's arm to the submission. I mean we were like, I was not, so it was a competition? Well No, it was at his old place and this is when I started training with him and we, I think we put on like very light hockey gear and I was just going to beat the shit out of him. I was just going to, yeah, well that was my goal cause he said he based, this was before I learned about a liveliness training and and you know, resisting. That's the lifeness. Yeah. So that's like Matt Thornton to me and, and, and it's a combination of, that's a whole other discussion. It's like, um, timing, energy and motion, resisting opponents, ways to figure out what's true and what works. And I, uh, this gets back to our discussion about shadow boxing and about training other ways.

Speaker 2:          00:25:57       I had trained with a stick and I had known all of these kind of basically this caught to things, but I also trained against a willing opponent. Like when you watch these stick demos, the key to to look for is what the UK does. The feeder, you know, it's not what the guy does. UK, I think this is a Japanese word for like the guy who's feeding in, you know, like, oh, okay, so the guy who is, I do this and that people, most of the people are listening to this. It's like probably 90%, even though a lot of watching it. So what, what you're demonstrating for those who are listening is like, there's, um, these live, these drills that you do where someone will pretend to throw a punch gifts so the person will step aside and do their counter attack and it looks awesome. So the UK guy has it. Got We in taekwondo, he used to call it the one steps. Yeah. The one steps.

Speaker 3:          00:26:44       Yeah. And, and it's, it's a great example of a fantasy based martial art because it makes you, it brings you further from reality. It makes you think you can do something that you simply cannot do. So what you need to do in those circumstances is you need to watch the feed or the person who's giving the reverse punch. It's like punched that comes off of your, I'm trying to be caught a punch that comes off of your ribs and goes out and they almost never hit somebody. Like if, if you watched the Steven Seagal when he got his black belt as a famous black and white video that's out there and Jamie can link to it, I guess. Uh, it looks awesome, but it's bullshit. It's all choreographed. The kido. Yeah. So, so the, the key deliverable I think in this call, one of those in this conversation is that whether it's shadow boxing or whether it's Kata or whether it's taking a knife and doing a drill.

Speaker 3:          00:27:37       When I used to do those train with sticks, I was really, really good. But I always knew the angle. So it was fantasy based. If you took the angle out of it, I would just get beaten to death. I mean peeps, I'm, what do you mean by angle? So like in disrobed or scream or there are 12 angles. It goes 99 it goes like 75 degrees, 35 degrees the other way. Baseball swing, reverse baseball, swing, stab, overhand stab, tack to the knees, attack to the other needs. So when you do, when you do those, when you train, you guys just do the numbers one, two, three and you know, you get so good at it. I mean it's pretty crazy. I can show your stuff here. You know? It's like if I know the angle, it looks awesome. I've seen guys do it. It looks pretty bad ass, but it's bullshit.

Speaker 3:          00:28:23       It's bullshit. It's fantasy based martial arts because the opponent isn't resisting. You have to have a resisting opponent. But here's the deliverable for this conversation I think is that if you train in a certain way, absent to corrective mechanism, but you think that corrective mechanism is an actual corrective mechanism. In other words, you think you're training in a way that will bring you closer to reality, but you're becoming further from reality. What that does is that takes that, that's just a, that's devastating because you need that corrective mechanism. You need to bring your thoughts in alignment with reality. And that was the great thing about the UFC is because now we have all these people and we can see what works. So think about the guys. You know I, I listened to your show that he bravo are I think, and he said, you know, he was just practicing the, the rear naked on his leg from, well that's not gonna work because there's no corrective mechanism because I don't think you understand what you're saying. Well maybe I wasn't, he was exercising his squeeze on his leg. He still does it. And it's because one of the things about Jujitsu, about finishing a technique is how hard can you squeeze and how long can you squeeze. So what Eddie does is he'll do this like, well if we're watching TV together, he'll do it. He puts his knee up. If we're watching the fights, who put his knee up like this and he'll rear naked,

Speaker 2:          00:29:42       choke his own knee and just squeeze it. And what he's doing is he's working on it, squeeze and it's not thinking that that's going to make him get to that position where he can squeeze someone. Okay. Well the or against a live resisting opponent. He's, it's an exercise. Okay. So that's cool. So if, if the idea then is that we'll work on your squeeze, then that's different from thinking that, that if, if I, if I, if I train, if you practice, think about like practicing shadow boxing and you're to use your example and your hook is always, you know, wide, you stand here and then when you get into a fight, if you deal with a resisting opponent and you do that, so you would have, you would have gone down a path to make you worse than are, but that's assuming that you're doing it incorrectly.

Speaker 2:          00:30:26       If you train correctly and you learn the techniques correctly and then you apply them in your shadow box and correctly it's going to benefit. Yeah. Okay. So that's the question that the question is, and I mean the, the great thing about this conversation is that we can test this stuff, right? I mean this is the ultimate we have, we have people we have, so for that we need to look at the, the only big word I think we need here today is pedagogy. Like at the training method, it's a big word for training method. We don't even need pedagogy. Just say training method. So we look at the training method and what I think you would need for that is, well actually I guess here's my question to you. Would it be better in your mind to train shadowboxing or to do some light boxing with guys with focus middle over there at guys holding up focus Mitts at the same speed that you were shadowboxing?

Speaker 2:          00:31:19       This is where I think the conversation is going on, right? It's not that it's better. All those things have their merits. Shadowboxing has its merit. Yoga has its merit. Yoga is not going to teach you how to be a a better fighter, but if you learn all the techniques of Jujitsu and you incorporate yoga into your training, it will likely elevate your Jujitsu. There's, I have absolutely no question that that's true and I think that that goes along with shadow boxing. If you're, especially if you're a striker, if you're a striker and you don't shadowbox, I think you're doing yourself a disservice. I think there is a benefit to a visualization and to movement. And two, there's, there's things that happen when you throw combinations in the air. Um, as far as you are dexterity, especially with kicking and your ability to even do combinations without any resistance or without anybody, um, uh, trying to counter you, there's, there's benefit in stringing together those reps, those repetitions. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So I think there is a benefit of that. And I think so sometimes if I, if I go in to straight blast and there's nobody on the mat, there's no way to roll with, sometimes what I'll do is I'll just go through the motions. Like I'll do roles or I'll do go over my back shoulder or I'll just, you know, fall down. There's

Speaker 3:          00:32:40       merit, there's merit to that in that, um, I think I already know how to do it. I mean I'm sure sure that I could improve on it without any question at all. Is so like your example of yoga is a really good one. I think it's certainly true that you can use muscles and yoga that you don't, and another activity. And I think that those have benefits to mma. In fact, I'm sure they have benefits to a lot of other things. So, so the not just the flexibility aspect and the body maintenance, there's a lot of good things to it. Yeah. I don't do it myself. I probably should, but if I would, I'd just spend that hour and doing Jujitsu to be blunt with you. But I think that you can get things out of yoga and get things out of these other activities, but you have to be conscious about the reason why you're doing these things and the way to get better ultimately like, yeah, so you could shadow box at a certain level.

Speaker 3:          00:33:37       Um, and again, I guess I think we can think about it at, in terms of the layup example, again, it's not necessarily the lay the ball is the corrective mechanism with the layup. The person is the corrective mechanism and the fight. And as long as somebody knows what they're doing and their training in a certain way, it's not necessarily that shadowboxing, we'll take one away from one school if it's being practiced correctly. I think Carta would take one away from one school, but I think that the whole project, like if you think about, and that's why I think the shadow boxing is such a good example of this. What is it that that w okay, so when someone's shadow boxes, the, the point is to warm up that accomplishes that. You could do that with squats to right. And someone or you know, you could do that in any one of a number of, you're looking at me like you're lost. No, no,

Speaker 4:          00:34:34       that was all in your head, man. I just ain't got, I got, I got that look like we're just talking about, no, no, I'm just listening. Yeah. Well if you think I'm, if you think I'm off track, let me know. Uh, you might be a little off track. Um, in that I think you think there's very little benefit and a lot of these activities that I think a aren't primary activities. I think, yeah, if you wanted to break it down to what is the only, see there's just this broad range of things you can do, you could do to improve all sorts of athletic endeavors. Like there's a lot of people that don't believe you should do any strength and conditioning training. You should just do technique and you should just do sparring. There's a lot of people that go that route. And then there's other people that think that's absolutely foolish you should primary like, especially once you learn the skills you should, if you're competing, you should focus primarily on strength and conditioning because really it's just about burning your body out and reaching an incredibly high level of cardio so that when you compete, you know all these techniques already, you will now a gas tank that's superior to your opponents and that will lead to victory.

Speaker 4:          00:35:40       Like there's a lot of modalities and there's a lot of schools of thought. Can we talk for a sec? Can we talk about that for a sec? Sure. So it's interesting to me. I see guys who come in who, uh, who are just super strong. And I think to a certain extent we need to be careful because strength, and again, I'm not speaking from experience so much, I'm speaking of just conceptually. I think there's a tendency for strong guys or big guys to overlay upon their strengths or size small man Jiu Jitsu is the best to just tell people if they're thinking about learning. Jujitsu learned from a little person because little guys, you know, boiler Gracie or even Eddie Bravo before he started lifting weights that he's quite a bit bigger now, but Eddie was always like, you know, 150 pounds, 140 pounds. So what he was rolling, he would always be rolling with big guys and he had to rely on perfect technique.

Speaker 4:          00:36:31       Whereas a guy like Frank Mir, who's a very large man, has a lot of physical strength and they rely on that. Yeah. And I think, well, you tell him what you think. Do you think that if somebody goes in strong and they focus on that often that that can come at the expense of learning techniques? Yes, it can. But here's the problem, the concept of strength and conditioning. A lot of people think, oh well you're doing squats and dead lifts. Um, a good example is a guy I've had on this podcast before. His name is Nick Khorsandi, Trans Hofeld Osan Joe see trains a Russell and providing the cough was a frame famous boxer, but a lot of world class athletes. Joe Schilling, who's a glory to shirt, I'm wearing a one of their uh, best fighters, excellent kickboxer world champion. What he's doing is his strength and conditioning program.

Speaker 4:          00:37:15       He trained under Marvin Marinovich and nick does a lot of plyometric exercises, a lot of sprinting, a lot of box jumps and all these really unorthodox techniques. And the idea is to improve your ability to execute things, improve your ability to close the distance and includes your, improve your ability to get out of the way and prove your ability to maintain a high workload through the rounds. You know, like if you can only throw, uh, let's say 50 kicks in, around before you get exhausted, and if you can improve that through strength, strength and conditioning, make it 75 or 80, you're going to have a significant advantage over the pace that you can push on your opponent. And that is in his opinion and many other people's opinion. And this is, this is a really open debate right now in the world of martial arts because it has not been solved because it relies on so many variables.

Speaker 4:          00:38:07       It relies on the athlete themselves, their mental fortitude, their dedication to their craft. Um, how good is their technique in the first place before they embark on a trunk strength and conditioning program? There's so many variables I think to unbox all this. Um, and to make it a little bit easier for people that are going, what the fuck are they talking about? What we're saying is there's a lot of people that have distorted ideas about reality itself and a method for exposing that kind of thinking, which is like this sort of dogmatic religious thinking, which is ultimately accepted by all the people around you, but never, never critically judged. Yeah. A really good method is Jujitsu and the, the meaning, the reason why Jujitsu is such a good method is because Jujitsu is one of the few martial arts that you could practice at any age and you could apply to.

Speaker 4:          00:39:07       And you could also watch those techniques being applied by other people. And when, you know, gigit like yesterday I went to the Eddie Bravo invitational, which was at the orpheum theater in downtown La, some of the best Jujitsu fighters in the world. We're going at it. Uh, and it was really amazing to watch. It was awesome. And it was a, a crowd filled with thousands of people who are fans of Jujitsu and practitioners. So it was really educated crowd. And what was cool about that is we all understood like when the guy got to a position like, oh, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. And you know, the crowd would cheer when someone would get out of a heel hook or they would cheer when a guy would be able to tap a guy with a rear naked choke. And we were watching all these things play out.

Speaker 4:          00:39:48       So there was lessons for me as a, as someone who's not competing as sitting in the audience, because I've spent so much time doing Jujitsu, I was watching this sort of, these interactions take place in a very logical truth seeking truth seeking community. Exactly, exactly. I mean, when the techniques work, the techniques work. And by the way, what's interesting is Brazilian Jujitsu as it was first created, or a first sort of established came from Japanese Jujitsu and Elio Gracie and Carlos Gracie, who were probably two of the most important people ever in the history of martial arts. They, they sort of manipulated those techniques and improved upon them and made the art more about the submissions than it was about the stand up and the bringing the fight to the ground. And in doing so, they established a series of techniques and you know, we, we refer to those techniques as the basics.

Speaker 4:          00:40:45       There are some people in that world that think that the basics are all you need and they don't accept the new techniques. And it's really fascinating because that's essentially how Jujitsu became effective in the first place is because the new techniques that were established by Carlos and Elio, Gracie and all these different movements like the guard, like learning how to do triangles off your back, all these different things, which people had no idea. And the early UFC like Royce gracie tapped out, dan severn, everybody's like, what the fuck is he doing? He's got his legs wrapped around his neck and his arm. What is this? And then Dan's about to go out and he taps and everybody's like, whoa, this is crazy. Well those were in our world, completely new techniques. Well there's a lot of new techniques that are constantly being established now by these young innovative practitioners and that some of the old guard are ignoring.

Speaker 4:          00:41:35       And the real question is, is that smart? Do you just need the basics? And it's a hot debate right now. But again, this hot debate can be proven. That's exactly what I was going to say. Yes, that's exactly right. And if as a result of this being proven, somebody doesn't change their mind. So the core piece that what's really important is belief, revision, critical thinking is all about, I made a mistake. I was wrong. I thought this, you know what, I, I, I made a mistake. And so if they don't do that, then they're somehow deficient in that attitude and disposition of critical rationality, you know, they, but it would seem to me if it could be demonstrated, people who want to seek the truth in this case, they want to win against a resisting opponent. Some, some would, some would accept the data, but many haven't.

Speaker 4:          00:42:27       And my good friend Eddie Bravo is a perfect example of that. I went with Eddie to Brazil in 2003 and he competed in the world championships and he beat, um, Gustavo Dante, who was a world champion at the time. He tapped him in his first fight. And then after that he fought boiler Gracie, who was one of the greatest Brazilian jujitsu competitors of all time. Hoya gracie's a national hero. They closed the other mats off. They put a spotlight on the main event and they thought they thought that Heuler was going to wreck this young kid who wasn't even a black belt at the time. Eddie was a brown belt. Okay. And Eddie with his unorthodox techniques that people had laughed at tap toilet gracie in front of everybody and he got him with the triangle, but he got up the setup was his rubber guard set up.

Speaker 4:          00:43:08       He has all these crazy guards set ups and you know, his game has advanced light years since then. But the point being that people mocked him for that, it didn't help that he went to his next fight. He fought Leo Vieira and he popped his rib early in the fight and got dominated in that fight and almost got tapped. But he know there was also a giant emotional let down because he couldn't believe he just tapped toilet gracie. And now, now he's moving on and he's fighting Leo Vieira, who's another monster, Brazilian Jujitsu, ours. But there's a point for the longest time people, there was two schools of thought. There was the old guard that just did not accept him. They openly mocked him. And you know, the, the really criticized his whole movement and his, his techniques, what champions is, he produced all this. This doesn't really work on real fighters until he had a rematch with boiler many years later and just wrecked him.

Speaker 4:          00:43:56       I mean, it was, it was worse than the first time because heuler didn't tap, but he got his knee destroyed. I mean, if you watch that video who are just deals with the fact that his knees getting ripped apart while Eddie's mangling it, but it was never a moment where Eddie was in trouble. He dictated the entire match. And we played the fight on, uh, on the TV, on a, on a podcast. And had Eddie explained what he was doing and even when it looked like horror, Lou was improving the position and he was like, no, I let him do that. So I could do this and then I'll, then I would adjust and he was like explaining, I pulled him back on top of me because

Speaker 2:          00:44:32       I knew if I did that I would be able to move his arm higher up on my shoulder. Then I rolled him back over onto his back and then I can get deeper in on when he was explaining that it was even more humiliating. Because you've got this guy who earlier Gracie, who has a multiple time world champion who just did not learn these new techniques, feels like she's got these old techniques and that's it. So this is the application. That's exactly right. And if you don't learn it and if you're not willing to revise your beliefs and if you're not looking, if you're not willing to test this and accept the conclusion, you know, you might think something's common sense. Common sense is irrelevant. What's relevant is what works. Yeah. Well these new techniques that are constantly being innovative, they're constantly changing. Like it's almost impossible to stay up on all of it unless it's a monster part of your life and you're absorbing him every day.

Speaker 2:          00:45:21       Like the leg lock game is this new element that over the last few years has really come into play in a major way. Thanks to a bunch of guys, John, Donna, her, Eddie Cummins, Gary Tone and who won the Eddie Bravo and invitation only yesterday. These like really high level practitioners and instructors are constantly adding new improvements to approaches and techniques. So it's all a applicable, it's all you can watch it happen in real time. And even as someone who's not competing like me sitting in the audience, I understand the positions and the movements. So when I see all this new stuff and I see all these new approaches, it's like, wow, this game just continues to grow and evolve. Yeah, and w what amazes me is when I watched kids classes, kids are doing the craziest stuff. I mean they really have stood on the shoulders of giants and they're doing stuff that's just so advanced.

Speaker 2:          00:46:10       And I look at that now and I think, wow, it's like speed. Even great thing. How quickly these techniques and this game has been advanced in a very, very short period time. There has literally been, in my lifetime, a revolution in the martial arts. It really has. I've been saying this for a while, but I'll say it again. The UFC has changed martial arts so radically that there's been more improvement since 1993 there's been more evolution than there are. There have been in the last 10,000 years. That's real. That's 100% true. You go back and watch martial arts from 1993 and watch the UFC today, it's a completely different realm. Right? It's fascinating. The differences. Oh, of course. When you talk about Jujitsu being applicable and all its applicable inside Jujitsu, the problem is when you get someone who's a really good wrestler, who's an awesome kickboxer and you can't use your Jujitsu, you're still going to get fucked up.

Speaker 2:          00:47:06       Like a guy like chuck Liddell who you're not going to take down and he's going to knock you dead. He's a great wrestler. You mean he's a perfect anti Jujitsu guy? Okay. But even even that, look at that, I gave five things that work, boxing and wrestling with two of the five. They train against resisting opponents, right? Uh, so it's no surprise then, and maybe sometimes he comes from a Kempo background, you know, I mean, you, you've listed that it's one of the martial arts that don't really work, but that's the martial art that chocolate Dell learned for striking under John Hackleman. Yeah. Okay. So I mean, that's another example. People can, like I, I saw, I can't, so you're much more versed in the specifics than I am, but I, sorry, to burst a gunner Nelson fight and what she did, uh, I think it was, uh, uh, background hoss to someone's head and just ground Dick.

Speaker 2:          00:47:51       He did. Uh, no, he did. Uh, I thought he looked around house to someone's in the back of someone's head. He trained in traditional karate for years, Huh? Yes. Yeah. He's a brown belt in karate. Yeah. And so it's not that these techniques can't be integrated or that they don't work. Part of the problem is that they're sold as systems. You know, it's like, instead of picking and choosing, so if everybody trained against resisting opponents, it's not clear to me that there would be any styles, styles would fade away. Right. But then, and then that highlights the problem that we brought up earlier that you really can't resist. You can't train 100% resisting with kickboxing. If you want to be a healthy member of society, that's brain damage. I'm pretty sure I have brain damage and I stopped really getting hit in the head when I was 22.

Speaker 2:          00:48:39       I mean, I really haven't been hitting the head of that much since then, but I'm for sure something's fucked up in there. Yeah. I was watching a guy hit the pads about a brown belt a couple of weeks ago and I just thought to myself, I mean he, the whole thing was moving it and I thought to myself like, wow, like if that guy ever hit me, Oh yeah. I mean that would be it. I mean, it would just be over and, and I, and I watched people kick the heavy bag sometimes. Have you ever seen Melvin manhoef kicked the pads? Jesus Christ pull up Melvin manhoef trains with, uh, um, I forgot his trainer's name. Mike Mike's gym. And uh, I forgot how to say his last passenger, passenger. I forget how to say it cause he's there. Dot. They're a Dutch, they're from Holland. But uh, there's a, a video is a bunch of videos of Malvin but Melvin kicking the pads with him.

Speaker 2:          00:49:25       It's just Scott, the I'm terrifying cause he's a super fucking athlete and he's training with this really aggressive Moitai trainer or kickboxing trainer. Mike's gym is famous for like guys like Badr Hari and, and um, man who have that are just fucking ferocious aggressive competitors. And manhood is particularly famous for having just unbelievable knockout power. He knocked out Mark Hunt and he weighed 185 pounds. He knocked out Mark Hunt when mark [inaudible] was probably 300 pounds. Yeah. And so imagine some of those guys or people in their lineage fighting it is what fighting these guys who do Katas. There's not pads though. You gotta focus pads. See, see if you can find one with him. Yeah. That says, that's just my, see if you could find, um, Melvin manhood. That's him though. That's Melvin. But they're just sparring there, which most of the time they, they go hard. But, uh, they usually don't go too hard to the head. Yeah. That's the Holon style. So imagine those guys fighting these guys who are in make believe land. Oh yeah. You want your fantasy fantasy land, right? We've, we've played videos many times and recently one or here's hills. Malvin see, get some volume on that shit.

Speaker 5:          00:50:48       Sounds not saying for some reason, but you get the picture of him. He's a fucking destroyed that switch kick to the body. Good Lord. When you watch this guy in real life, it's even more stunning because you, you really can feel the impact when he's kicking the pads.

Speaker 2:          00:51:09       So the other thing about that is that guy knows we can do and he can't do, they don't spend a lot of these young kids, they see a movie with a guy who's beaten up five guys with knives and bats and stuff. It's total make believe land and it immerses people in a culture of make belief. Yeah, I agree. No, I couldn't agree more. And I was in that culture. I used to teach it. I taught at Boston University. I mean, it's like a big, big, huge part of my life. And, uh, the wake up call that I got was, it was a really stunning thing to just to end. It was, oh, it was a long progression. It wasn't just one wake up call. It was like one wake up call and then another one, and then deeper and deeper and deeper. And then the UFC comes along, you're like, oh fuck, you know, oh, this is this.

Speaker 2:          00:51:56       And then you get this understanding like, I live my life under this illusion. Yeah. And the other thing that's interesting to me about that is those are culturally reinforced, right? There are these rituals. There's the bowing, the master, the other people that your friends that you come to do these things with. All of that reinforces the delusion. It's, it's very similar to, to, uh, to religions. The way that religions focus with the difference being that people in religions, people who have faith, they think they're a bit better people as a consequence of them having faith. Whereas very few people in the delusional martial arts, you think that they think they're good fighters. But, oh, the techniques are too dangerous to task or we, you know, we can't, we can't do this and see if we did this, we would kill you. Uh, but those cultures of delusion keep people trapped in thinking about things that remove them from reality.

Speaker 2:          00:52:50       Yeah, there's definitely some of that, but I think there's some good to the idea of respecting a Dojo as a place where you, when you walk into it. One of the things stupid, but it's true. When I was a kid, I used to have keys to uh, the, the, the, it was a doe Jang, cause it was taekwondo is the Korean word doubled. I, even when no one was there, I would bow when I would walk in, when I would go to work out in the middle of the night, like I would go there, I had keys. So I, I would, I would train sometimes I'd show up at midnight, I go there and lock the door and go in myself. And then, but when stepped into the training area,

Speaker 4:          00:53:26       I would always bow and I was like almost like an ocd thing. Like, I wouldn't not do it because I, in my mind when I, like I had been trained and taught that when I entered that room I had to bow and even with there's fucking no one there man. I'm by myself and I always bout like one time my girlfriend, my girlfriend was a freak in high school. She wanted to fuck in the, in the gym and I was like, we can't, can't do it. I'm like, I won't do it. We can't do it here. And she's like, come on. I'm like, nope, not happening. It was a lost opportunity for you? Not really. I fucked the shit out of her. I fucked her all the time. We were like little fucking rabbits, but, but it was, there was the one place where I wouldn't do it.

Speaker 4:          00:54:04       I was like, we can't, I can't do it here. Like this is, this is a sacred ground for me. So I guess here's my problem with that, besides the lost opportunity, but it wasn't a lost opportunity for me. It was an execution of discipline of my mind. Like I, it was very hard for a 17 year old boy to not have sex with this hot, I think she was 1616 year old girl who wanted a bang in this karate or taekwondo gym. That's like, for me it was like that. This, this what, what martial arts meant to me at the time was there was this the first thing that I had ever done that made me feel like I wasn't a loser. So my whole life I'd been insecure and we had moved around a lot when I was a kid. I didn't really have a whole lot of friends and I never felt like I fit in and I always felt, you know, I didn't know my dad and you know, my stepdad was a little distant.

Speaker 4:          00:54:53       There was all this stuff going on, right? There was all these things that just didn't feel right, didn't, didn't make me feel good. And then this one thing came along that made me feel good. It's one thing came along that I had gotten really proficient, not really quickly and was absolutely obsessed with and I was doing it all day, all day. And there was a, that was my whole focus of my life. Other than the girl. No, no, it wasn't not sure. I'm sure it wasn't good at that. I'm sure it was probably terrible, but point being like I wasn't willing to sacrifice that. Like the ideals. It's interesting isn't it? Yeah. Yeah. So we use the same today. Do you think, I mean do you have that notion of sacred with regard to these things? I don't have that notion of sacred when it comes to like a space, but I do in terms of like my approach to things.

Speaker 4:          00:55:39       Like what if I, if I'm focused on something, like I don't allow myself to get distracted. If something is is, is, is critical, something's like really important to focus on. And I decided this is what I'm doing now, now I'm doing this, you know? So if I may wanna be overly personal, but like your marriage, you decided to do it, you're focusing on it too. So it's taken me, marriage is a contract. Okay. Relationships? Yes. Like the way you engage with someone. Like if you care about someone, here's a good way. Not just relationships as far as like sexual relationships, but friendships. If you care about someone and you, you really enjoy being with them and they're one of the most important people in your life. Like when you interact with them, I think you should interact with them under that provision or with that thought in mind with that.

Speaker 4:          00:56:28       Would that intention with what I missed? You intention that you care about them very deeply. These are important people in your life authentically. Like you don't, you don't ever want, like I don't, I would never like, like really good friends. I would never yell at them and um, you know, call them a piece of shit. I never want you in my life. Or it's like say crazy things to people that sometimes people say hurtful things. Yeah. You know, it doesn't mean don't be critical. It doesn't mean don't correct someone if you see them doing something that you've seen your friends doing something stupid, but that, I don't think that's a good example. I think, um, because marriage is not something that like, it's like something you're trying to do. You know, marriage is like, or even relationships, friendships are just their, those are their interactions.

Speaker 4:          00:57:16       So they should ships or it's different. Like it should be fun and enjoyable and all that good stuff, but I'm talking about as a discipline. Yeah. Well, what I was trying to tease out from you is that when you were 17, you had this idea of the Dojo being a sacred place. Yeah. And you talked about what that meant to you and I'm curious if there's anything that you hold sacred now. Um, that's a good question. Like that. Not, no, I've definitely changed my ideas about what that even was at the time. I think what that was that need for that sacred space in this like intense concentration and purity of that environment was really like my, my ticket out, my ticket out of this life that was really unfulfilling to manhood. Yeah. That definitely to sovereignty, personal sovereignty, to, um, to realize that, um, it's not that I, it's not that I was a loser.

Speaker 4:          00:58:19       He says that I wasn't a winner and I had to figure out how to be one. It wasn't, it wasn't all my failures, what I was is now and all those failures and all those mistakes and bad feelings that I had, those were really just lessons and that now that I have this new focus and this new thing and it's shown massive positive results, I will honor that. And that's what it was to me, that the new focus being one martial arts, fighting, competing taekwondo. So that space to Dojo, that Doe Jang represented a sacred place for me because it represented this new ticket and I wasn't about to cash that in for some Pussy Holla. You know what I'm saying? Like was my thoughts Matt. Now my, um, I mean if there's anything I would think that the world like life itself is that environment life itself, is that, that Doh Jang life itself is that thing. So you don't ever want, you don't want to steal, you don't want to commit crimes against people. You don't want to do things to hurt. All those, those, those, those terrible things that we see out in the world. If the world was your Dough Jang, if the world was your, your church, if the world was your sacred place, you would never want to commit bad acts in your sacred place.

Speaker 3:          00:59:44       That's a lovely, I wish we could figure out a way to, to help people adopt those values. You know, I wish we could come up with some way to, especially when we see what's going on in the Middle East and we see what's going on in the world and we see what the way we're treating our environment or climate, I wish there was some way to make that real and palatable to people so that we would start being more authentic and more sincere with someone. And, and I think what you said about, it's not about criticism, the way I look at it, I think it's about forthright speech. You can be forthright in your speech with somebody and not be, be be an asshole, not be a jerk. I think those kinds of relationships for, for me, aristotle talks about that too. But for me, I think that the most meaningful relationships are those people with whom I can be authentic. And be myself and be real. And those are kind of, I don't like the word sacred though. It's, I guess that's the one kind of nitpick I have.

Speaker 4:          01:00:48       Cause you attach that to religion. Well because I attach it to the inability to revise something. I attach it to the utmost respect. Yeah. So if we replaced a sacred for respect, I think we'd be noises. It's one of the things I don't like about labels. Like I like intent and intent. Like my, my idea of sacred is not like God. Like it's not like a sum, it's not a deity, this unnamed unknown word that's been passed down from person to person. It's based on personal experience based on a real thing. So when I say sacred, like my law, my love for my children is sacred. Right. You know, like I say it in that window. I don't, you know, say it like in terms of like harps and the clouds and all that kind of jazz. And when we were talking about, um, like don't be an asshole to people you care about.

Speaker 4:          01:01:36       Like it doesn't mean it certainly doesn't mean I'm some sort of a perfect person. Certain doesn't mean that I have been an asshole. And then sometimes when you're responding to someone else being retarded or someone being ridiculous, you can be an asshole because you don't have the patience for it anymore because you don't have the a at the moment you don't have the temperament to charity. Yeah. What? Yeah, it could be maturity. It could be you're overwhelmed. There's a lot of variables. So like if someone hears this and says, you know all, well man, I've been an asshole lately. Maybe I'm a bad person. Like No. It's just recognizing those moments where he probably could have handled something better and continuing to approve and then also this idea, here's this is a really important

Speaker 2:          01:02:20       one because people have this idea that somehow I'm 30 years old, I shouldn't be doing this anymore. I'm 50 years old. I should have learned by now. That's all bullshit. Throw that away, tossed that shit aside. You like these ideas of numbers that people have in their head that by a certain age you should stop. You are alive and if you are alive and if you are thinking all those numbers that you keep attaching, will, you know when Einstein was 30 heat or shut the fuck up, stop doing that. That that is a waste of your time and stop saying to yourself, I should be better by now. I'm such a total non helping thought what you need to think of his life. You're living, you're alive right now. And if you've made a mistake and you're still continuing to learn and grow, that's all just data. And I think bundled with that is gratitude. Gratitude is giant. We don't say a prayer in my household, but we go around every night. We have seven people living with us and we say what we're grateful for and what you went into commune when you doing? Uh, we have, it's a lot. We have a, it's a long story of a woman from China there. It's a lot of Christ. But what does she do? Wink, wink.

Speaker 2:          01:03:32       No sex slaves and bocce though. We have another woman who lives in the cargo container. Everybody who lives in the garage over there, no attention to the banging. Um, no, but you know, we go around, we talk about what they're grateful for. Everyone is grateful and I think that there's something, it's, it's an opportunity to be authentic at that time. But it's also like, I think verbalizing those things are important. So it's not just the negative, I shouldn't be doing this, but just the positive look. Is it general as a general rule of thumb, if you ever have any doubts about it, just be kind to people. It also, it's a, it's great when you reinforce it with your friends, like verbalizing it like a, um, I'm a big fan of tell. I tell my friends I love them all the time. Like me and my friend, like my wife jokes around about it.

Speaker 2:          01:04:13       She goes, I don't know any men that tell their friends. They love him all the time. But all my friends do, we all tell each other we love each other. You know, I love you brother. And we hang up the phone. I'm dealing with all my friends and you know, there were always hugging and always saying, I appreciate you. You know, I think it's really important. I have a very tight knit group of friends that I care about very much, and they're all very, they're very motivated and they're healthy and the, you know, they're not without flaws, but they're there. They got shit going on and it empowers me yet new up. So here's why. Here's why that's important. Because you got the tattoos, you got to build, you've been in the ring, you're friends with whomever, whoever you're friends with. And I think that whether you like it or not, you're in a position, particularly with young people to look up to you. And that is exactly the kind of behavior that we want to see modeled. It's not emotionally immature for a guy to cry at a tragic event. It's, I tell my friends I love them. I tell you know, people, I tell my buddy over there, I'm incredibly grateful for the opportunity to stay his house, et cetera. And I think that

Speaker 3:          01:05:17       that kind of, we live in a culture that's suppressed, these particularly males, this the ability for men to communicate in an authentic way. Also to experience emotion. Like this idea of somehow or another being stoic has virtue to it, especially in the form, in face of tragedy or even joy. Like I sometimes cry more or for happy moments sometimes and I do for a sad moments, but I, I'll cry, I'll cry fucking cartoons man. I almost cried. I have not a ton of times, I'm not crying to cartoons. But yeah. It's interesting. I think that that journey from you as a 17 year old to now, I mean there was some really core lessons for people out there struggling with maybe issues of sexuality or issues of feeling they hate the world and then on good enough or their, they, their self esteem issues are they, and I think that they, yeah, it acceptance and that's what we all want.

Speaker 3:          01:06:19       We all want to be loved and look. So I'm, I'm 49 and it's like I'd much rather be people say about me, hey, you know, pizza really good guy. Then pizza, really smart guy. I want, I want to, uh, you know, I want to embody those virtues. But, but more than that, I think that um, the story that you told there, it's, it's something that's accessible to people and it's a type of thing that we need to do. We need to figure out how to move our culture towards these more humane ways of dealing with people. And my own opinion is that we don't need superstitions to do that. You're a perfect example of that, right? We don't need people making objective claims about reincarnating and times through bodies like the dilemma or wait a minute, you don't think the Dalai Lama is a reincarnated saying, are you serious?

Speaker 3:          01:07:12       You got, you got nervous there for a moment. I thought, wow, this is going to be a long conversation. You see my Buddha said another buddha right there. See that's the funny thing. If like I'll call it just call bullshit on that in class and everybody will freak out. Whereas if I say, Jesus walking on water and I do, you can join. But if you start taking a moment, Buddhists and people were like, Whoa, bullshit. You know, how could you say that? Whatever. The Dalai Lama is so cool. He's friends with Steven Seagal. Yeah. Well you actually saw them years ago together doing their little thing. That all gets connected. Yeah. No, I um, I had a psychedelic trip that or saw a bunch of Golden Buddhas. So that's what lsd about no DMT. Oh Wow. Cause that cause that like literally that guy like in that position, but there was fractals with millions of them, infinite numbers of them. It was very strange. Um, so that's what that, that little puts, this guy made it for me. I wish I remembered this homeboy's name. I'll find it somewhere and I'll throw it up on instagram. I think it's on my instagram picture. Right. I don't know. I'll find it.

Speaker 4:          01:08:16       But um, yeah, all of those things, all those things are not necessary. It's a, I think we are necessary like all these, uh, the, the false beliefs and all the things, what they are is like scaffolding. I feel like they're scaffolding for like evolution and I think that that's ultimately the benefit that religion does provide is in, in these insane beliefs in the sky, gods and all these different things and we show reverence to these, uh, these deities and they have these rules that we must follow. Otherwise we would be punished in those rules. There becomes order and then the order becomes society. And that's, that's something that people always like to fall back on. Like we are a Judeo Christian sound founded society and our Judeo Christian ethics. Like I saw some woman who was arguing about Muslim terrorists and that was like one of the big things that this is this, this country was founded on Judeo Christian ethics.

Speaker 4:          01:09:09       Sowhat monkeys were founded on eating bananas and we're not monkeys anymore. No. It's like it's such a stupid fucking like just because something's founded on something that's illogical, it doesn't mean you should have reverence for that illogical things perfectly stated. That's part of the problem I think with once we make ideas sacred. Yes. And they become much more difficult, if not impossible to revise like George Bush saying, which is actually I invite your viewers or listeners to listen to this. Uh, he's prayed about the war in Iraq. He knows who God wants them to do. So the moment you do that, it becomes irreversible. I used to have a bit about that where George Bush was like, you know, uh, that he's prayed about the world in a rack and you know, God blessed the troops. Imagine if he said instead of that we have found Satan, he is in Afghanistan and we're moving tanks into that area.

Speaker 4:          01:09:59       Everybody would be like, Whoa, what the fuck did you do? Say? Right. That's the, that's the draw. That's the line that we draw. Like you're not hitting out. He said he prayed to vishnu or something. Nope. I mean, you're not allowed to say that. You know the devil. You're not allowed to say the devil is real. Like, and you never hear the president bring up the devil. They'll bring up God. God blessed the troops. Got, they'll never say Satan is at work and Satan is in the hearts and minds of these, uh, uh, these enemies. They never say that because it's so preposterous that we're slowly as evolution as thinking evolves and changes. I know evolutions where I'm worried for there, but as it improves and expands, we are no longer accepting the idea of Satan. Like culturally, culturally, Satan was an accepted thing hundreds of years ago.

Speaker 4:          01:10:51       It was parallel like he, like if you looked at the mentions of Satan and dimensions of God, they were right up there together. You're blaming Satan on the bad things and you praising God for the good things. That's no longer the case. Now we just cling to these absurd notions of this one that's watching us all the time. And you've got to sort of peripherally mention it and casually reference it without going into detail. And you're allowed to do that because it makes people think, well, you're on the same page as me. You're a god feeling Kurt and Christian man like myself, I'm a god fearing Christian man myself as well. God bless you. God bless you as well. You know, but if you go out, Satan is looking out for you. Peyton's watching you right now, Satan is just letting the air out of your tires.

Speaker 4:          01:11:33       Like you go, oh, that guy's a fucking idiot. You know, like we've moved past Satan. Yeah. But we haven't moved past Scott. Exactly right. Or the idea of God, even though, I mean if there is some all knowing entity that is controlling everything and is filled with love and has a grand plan for the universe, they have yet to show themselves. So this is all just a concept and an idea with no basis. In fact. And as we have found more facts about the nature of reality in the world itself, it seems more and more preposterous with every day, every day the scientists come up with these new equations that show the the way the universe could have possibly be been formed. And the every day that these fucking guys at the cern laboratory, the, they're the large Hadron collider, are discovering these what were at one time theoretical particles showing them to be true in their calculations to be correct.

Speaker 4:          01:12:32       We're having. We have a deeper and deeper understanding of the universe, but we think now, we love to think that right now that were filled with knowledge and we'd love to look at ourselves now and look at the past as well. They didn't know back then, but we know now, but if we looked in the past, they would have the same ideas. They would look back at those poor monkey people with the bananas and then they'll go those fucking dummies. They didn't even know houses yet. We will one day look back at 2015 like what a bunch of fools, what a bunch of ridiculous people that were still, they have this incredibly complicated society in this wonderful access to information, but yet they were still shackled down by ideology and killing each other over religion and ancient superstitions that the dictated their behaviors. Like what a weird time to be in.

Speaker 4:          01:13:23       They'll look at, they'll look at us now in 2015 they'll say, what a strange time this is adolescent period of, of, of enlightenment, where they're just still there, still concentrating on stupid shit in the fucking president of the United States can openly talk about God and every and no and no one goes, what is God? What are you saying? Like what are you saying? Do you think Jesus came back from the dead weight? What do you think? Do you think someone walked on water? Do you believe in the literal translation? Are you an old testament guy or a new testament guy? Well off a new instruments? He's like, no. Well the New Testament was made by Constantine who was a fucking Roman emperor who wasn't even Christian. He didn't even believe it. He was, he was, he was, he was, he became a Christian. I was fucking death bed. Like that's when he became a Christian. I go, these people that are really into the new testament and like, I'll

Speaker 2:          01:14:12       talk about old testament shit and people get mad at me on twitter. They'll send me this fucking hate texts. You understand? Motherfucker. What the difference is the Old Testament, the new testament, because the new testament is utter horse shit. It was created by a bishop and a fucking emperor. That's a fact. That's like established religious fact like everyone knows where it came from. And not only that, it was written hundreds of years after the death of Jesus. So what are you talking about? Because if you're talking about the old stuff, you got to go deep. What would go to the Dead Sea Scrolls? Go, go to the, go to the fucking did go to the most ridiculous aspects of that and tell me you basing your life on that because that's even more preposterous. They found them in clay pots in Qumran, written on animal skins. These people thought the world was flat and a son was 17 miles away and we're going to have, they did.

Speaker 2:          01:15:00       They really did. And we're going to, we're going to do, this is what we're going to live our lives. This is it. This is all the facts we need. Fucked the whole large Hadron collider. Fuck cern. You know, Fuck Steven Hopkins and fuck quantum physics. Fuck Neil degrasse Tyson. Fuck those dudes with their telescopes. Now that we're going to base it on leather skins and and and, and charcoal ink, right? Like really that's, that's the, that's the conversation we're having when we're talking about ideological religions. That was a thing of beauty by the way. Oh thanks. That was a thing of beauty, what it is and people think, well you renew fuse your nurse school, your, what do you believe in? I had a guy yell at me at a comedy club once cause I did this bit about scientology. I do this bit about scientology, about watching a scientology documentary with my mom who made me go to Catholic school and how my mom thinks scientology's religion.

Speaker 2:          01:15:49       Ridiculous. I'm like, what the fuck is this guy like, Yo, what do you believe in? What do you believe in? Like what if I have to believe in something? Right. Do I have to believe I believe in everything that has been proven. I believe that this is made out of wood and I see it when I'm proven wrong. Right. When change your mind, it's back to the Jujitsu thing again. But when you also think about it, what an unbelievable arrogance to think that you know the will of the creator of the universe. You know what he wants you to do. You know where he wants you to put your genitals. I mean, like you said it philosophy, it's called the problem of induction or looking at the past, the past, past, resembling the past. And we will look back, there's absolutely no question in my mind that you're correct and we will say, wow, will you believe this?

Speaker 2:          01:16:30       This was, how could we possibly have believed this? But what's interesting to me is we know that that will happen. Like we know that that will happen and it's an opportunity for us to reflect and say, wow, are we being arrogant right now? W are we thinking we know things? So we pretending to know things when we don't know them. And I think, I think that a lot of that God talk is a type of arrogance. I think it's a type of people, I dunno, wanting to assert how moral they are so they reap advantages. The president or, I mean, I think it's a very complicated social and even political problem, but it's also a type of arrogance.

Speaker 4:          01:17:10       It is definitely a type of arrogance and it's also a way that people stab the moral high ground. They establish a dominant social position over you. And the people love to do that. They'd love to do that with their pious attitude. What they're doing is by, by them accepting these religious tenants, they are somehow are superior to you. And some people don't do that. And you know, I shared a hunting camp with this guy. I don't need to names names. A wonderful guy who was a, an elk hunter and this guy would get up in the morning every day before everybody. And we've got up fucking early, you know, we would leave the camp by 6:00 AM so this guy was up, I would get up to take a shower like 5:00 AM and this dude was up reading the Bible and he never talked about it and he never talked about like God or Jesus or any of the rules.

Speaker 4:          01:17:55       But to him it was a way that he explored these ideas and how he related to the world and in application. This guy was a fantastic, absolutely. He was a wonderful guy. Like he was, he was kind and it was like when you had conversations with him, he was generous and it was very friendly and he was curious and he would ask like these really introspective questions, like he was a good guy. And I think that's what matters. I think it matters less whether or not someone is an atheist or not or a Hindu. And I think what matters is how we treat other people. I think what manages, if we're kind to people, if we listen to people, if we do our best to engage them honestly and authentically and often we get too caught up in, well, what is someone's real, especially now with the Republicans going bizarre, bizarre fuck with this whole Islam thing.

Speaker 4:          01:18:47       It's just crazy and disgraceful. Well, you know, did you see that video is a fantastic video that's just been put out recently I think by some guys in Holland. Um, where they were because it's in another language. Oh, the Bible. Yeah. I saw that. They put a cover of the, put the Koran cover on the Bible and then read passages to people on the street and they asked him what do they think about this? And you know, they were like, wow, this is ridiculous and this is outrageous. And it was all from the Bible, like Hilarious, hilarious shit that a lot of people don't know is in the Bible. And when you even bring this up, people already, you're questioning their beliefs. So they start foaming at the mouth and fuming and that, fuck, I can feel my phone get heavy from hate tweets right now.

Speaker 4:          01:19:36       It's just coming in. You're fucking question in my view of reality and it makes me uncomfortable when not going to work. Right. But isn't that the exact same issue with someone doing a fantasy based martial arts? Oh a hundred percent I've had conversations with people where they are fucking furious at me because I don't believe in their death touch. I've had conversations with people they like, you know, you are arrogant and your belief and martial arts and you're in a position of a, of influence because of your work for the UFC and what you're doing is you're, you're fucking up. Cause you're not telling the truth

Speaker 2:          01:20:08       about certain stop. Right? Like did you stop abandoned it, but, but you, we, if you're like me, who, like I said, I was martial arts and that the doe Jang was so sacred to me, I wouldn't need to have sex with my girlfriend there. That represents like such an important part of their life. It's just so lucky for me that it happened during my formative period where I was exposed to reality at a young age where I had to accept it. I was like, God, Jesus, you know, I had to accept that these techniques don't really work all the time. Some of them work, but you have to learn all the other stuff for them to work at all. Yeah. And I wonder about, again, so few people have written about this. I wonder about the experience that you had of that. And I had of that we were in the same boat realizing over time that these things just didn't work and we had wasted our time.

Speaker 2:          01:20:59       And I wonder how similar that is to someone's escaped from a faith, you know, like 100% people that have escaped from cults. Like I've had folks on that have a, used to be in cults. Kurt Metzger is a perfect example, is a hilarious standup comedian friend of mine and you know, he was in Jehovah's Witness. Is that what it yeah, I think so. And um, he uh, you know, he won't accept any stupid shit now cause he's like, and he's like, no, like when it comes to the regressive left and some of these ideologies where you have to look at something in a certain way and you can't look at it in another way, it's like a dogma and he's like, no, no, no. I've seen this before. I know what this is. What you're doing is you're, you're saying you have to think a certain way.

Speaker 2:          01:21:41       That's bullshit. That's bullshit. Like it can be discussed like you q can discuss certain aspects of people's behavior or gender identity or gender pronouns are in fact, not only can it be discussed, but it has to be discussion. We have to have arenas and a lot of people have been writing about this lately. I wrote about in my book and I tweeted about it. If we have, if we're not allowed an opportunity to have a conversation than extremists will step in with the answers. Like trump is a great example. So we have to create spaces, talk about spaces. This is probably another offshoot of the conversation space. The regressive left, right? We need to create opportunities for people to, for sincere inquirers to engage things. And right now we don't have that. And again, I, I can bring it back to Jujitsu. I mean you could just think about what would happen if you know, this is a technique, you do this, blah, blah, blah, blah. It's sacred. We don't question it. Then you'd never get to the truth. You deny people the opportunities that they need to figure out things for themselves. 100%, a hundred percent. And I think martial arts is an excellent vehicle for that. The one of the things that was explained to me when I was really young, they're really did sink in. My, uh, instructor, uh, was a, uh, a disciple of general chase, young [inaudible] who was the founder of taekwondo. He was, you know, he taught it to troops and he was like,

Speaker 4:          01:23:06       or the, the guy's like really honed the techniques for maximum power and efficiency and leverage. And He, um, they had this idea that martial arts was a vehicle for developing human potential. And, uh, I read that when I was like 15, and I've always used that phrase because I think that's a, uh, such a massive, yeah. What do you mean by such a massive what, uh, well, it's, it's, it's so clear when you, when you understand that we will, you go through life. Life is filled with questions, a diversity puzzles, different things. You have to figure out the questions you have to ask of yourself. Examining your own behavior, objective reasoning. There's all these different variables that come into play when it comes to life. And I think those are highlighted in the realm of martial arts because mark, if you can land a kick and you knock someone out and then that that happened, that worked and you were in the ultimate, like especially the ultimate fighting championship is a perfect example of that.

Speaker 4:          01:24:12       But there's, there's no higher level of problem solving than problem solving with dire physical consequences because your emotions are on the line, your fears, your anxiety. There's so, there's so many fight or flight mechanisms in place, there's self doubt, there's, you know, how much discipline did you truly execute in training? Did you give everything you had? Did you reach your full potential? Most people go through life without even coming close to their full potential. And they live life in this, this weird fog of uncertainty and of regret and of, of, of just this feeling that they're not accomplishing what they want to, that they're not achieving their full potential. And that martial arts is a vehicle for developing potential because through the very difficult training and through pushing yourself when you don't think you can, and through this overwhelming desire for comfort, we don't want to get out of bed.

Speaker 4:          01:25:17       What are you, you don't want to do the training where you would rather just blow it off and don't go to class. By forcing yourself to do that it, it engages the muscles of discipline. The inner muscles. Yeah. And it also you understand about accomplishing goals and about about reality facing things that it's just so important. So again, it's Jujitsu. When you defeat somebody, like if you, you, you work really hard and you tap someone else, you get a sense of, you get a little, I'll speak for myself. I feel good. Like wow, like I worked for this, I tried hard, I work on my baseball back, choke now and I feel pretty good. So that activity, your hard work brought you to a point in which

Speaker 2:          01:26:04       you would tap somebody out. And as a consequence of that, you feel self esteem. What we have done is we have inverted the system. We tried to teach self esteem absent any accomplishments. That's not the way it works. Self esteem is a byproduct of hard work of something that you have done as a direct result of an accomplishment. So every, every few years they give Americans, they give kids all around the world to test. I read this in um, Martin is the conspiracy of ignorance many years ago, excuse me. In the to the test is like, Hey, all these people in the world, you know the Koreans, the industrialized world, Japanese, German center, they took this, how do you think you did in relation to them? Americans consistently score on the bottom core tile in terms of their math and science, how well they did and in comparatively, but they score extraordinarily high.

Speaker 2:          01:26:56       Number one, almost always in terms of self esteem. We have taught the wrong things. We focused on the wrong things. Our school systems have been oriented toward the wrong things. And I think again, you can just bring that back to Jujitsu and look at it. Look at that. You don't, you couldn't possibly, you could teach someone all of a self. So you walk in, they get a white belt, you teach him to feel good about themselves, do this to this, to this, but does it work? Yeah, yeah. No, it's, you could get a lot of the lessons from martial arts out of a lot of difficult endeavors. You know, I just don't think you get the problem solving aspect at the, it's such a high level, like some people find that in rock climbing because it's scary. And then in, in, in accomplishing that and then getting through that you, you, you learn about yourself and learn about your ability to Chicago adversity and to face your fears.

Speaker 2:          01:27:48       But I just think that martial arts is a more intense version of it because there's all this connected to combat and to this, the physical challenge of overcoming another human being. And it's one of our biggest fears. One of our biggest fears other than falling off of a mountain is being dominated by another human being, getting your ass kicked and conflict where we have this long history of war. I mean, I was talking to, I heard that podcast the Jocko. Yeah. The seal guy. Yeah. That's a great podcast. He's an awesome guy. But we were talking about the conversation that I had with my friend Duncan trussell where I said that and we, it was kind of a revelation for the both of us and like human history is a history of the wars. That's when we talk about human history. It's like the stuff that happened in between the wars and you know, some inventions, but it's mostly the wars.

Speaker 2:          01:28:36       That's most of the history, you know, where whether it's world war one or world war two or Vietnam or you know, there's all these different conflicts that that happened and those are the bulk of our history. When we, when we consider the errors in the past, when we consider the, the, the ages of the different things that happened, we consider like kingus Khan and Napoleon Alexander the Great and all these different things that happen. We're considering war. Yeah. I'll, I'll go off on a little tangent if you don't mind. It makes me think, I've been thinking about talking to my buddy over there about life and the universe in this thing called the Fermi paradox. Where is everybody and I wonder if that the Fermi paradox being the amount of life that must be out there. You know, like why haven't we been contacted yet? I consider that to be just an extraordinarily interesting question, but I wonder if what you just said that our history has been a history of war.

Speaker 2:          01:29:30       I, I, I wonder if inherent in every species that has evolved, they've had a similar history of war, you know, because they've been subject to different evolutionary mechanisms and pressures and such, you know, like different atmospheres would have it, but I wonder if it's conflict over resources, conflict over, you know, whatever. Maybe they have another gender or something. I wonder if that's just intrinsic in the nature of life. I think it is. I think what's intrinsic in the nature of life is that sort of problem solving and that nature wants to find the best method of achieving a goal. And so the methods that are ineffective die off. And that's why 90% of the living species that have been on this planet are extinct. They no longer exist because they weren't effective enough to be, to keep reproducing. And you can say, no, we'll a lot of them because people wipe them out.

Speaker 2:          01:30:26       People are evil and people are horrible. People are the dominant species. What species do, I mean many animals have wiped out animals. You know, there's a, there's a real issue right now with wild pigs and ground nesting birds because wild pigs being an invasive species, they're dealing with these birds that nest on the ground that didn't have these animals hunting them. And, or they shouldn't even say hunting. They're eating their eggs. Um, so that's just an ineffective way to diet. Yeah. They, it's an ineffective way to take care of your eggs. Can't leave them on the ground and a place where these fucking pigs are rooting up everything and eating everything in front of them. So if they go ahead. No, it's okay. No. If they don't adapt, then there'll be no more. Yes, absolutely. Are Gone. And you know, people say, Oh, it's so evil.

Speaker 2:          01:31:12       It's so awful. Would you want a world filled with only the spotted owl? No. Okay. Well, the spotted owl dies off. It's cause it sucked. All right. I'm sorry. I'm not saying we should kill the spotted owl, but the motherfucker didn't make it. Okay. And the other animals are still here and eagles are still here and got, by the way, you wouldn't want a world filled with all eagles either. And there's a competition between eagles in salmon. If the eagles eat all the salmon, we're going to be pissed at the eagles, you know? I mean, if the eagles make the stamp, the salmon extinct, we're going to be like, what the Fuck Eagles. But you know, it's funny when you're, so you're talking about this and uh, in the back of my head, I mean, you're absolutely right. In the back of my head I'm thinking, wow, like the, so we're having a conversation, right?

Speaker 2:          01:31:54       You and I are talking like if I started as talk about that, some of that stuff in class, that's when you get the whole trigger warnings, safe spaces and stuff. Again, like people would freak out. But look, this is really important. I mean, you're talking about species, you're talking about survival. You're talking about taking care of the planet and you know, how do we weigh the concerns of the spotted owl against the loggers? I mean, you're talking about some really important things and the recourse to I'm offended or I can't think of what makes me upset. It makes me think that maybe soon universities won't be the, I mean we'll have to have these discussions out of the universities, which really be, it's a great for you in your show. It's at, but it's terrible for the society. It's terrible for the university. It's terrible.

Speaker 2:          01:32:34       The universities in a sense of cease to have these sorts of conversations. When you watch those children scream at that professor at Yale and then you find out that that guy was disciplined and like, why were they fired? Or they stepped down. They resign. Yeah, I think they resigned. Yeah, we're fucked. But I think, I think liberals are eating themselves. I think the left is literally arrested, left breast. I think there's a difference. Yeah. Well, yeah, that's a good point. Because liberals in terms of social change and progress and you know, acceptance of a various different people. I think that's wonderful. It's great. But I think that this regressive left with this very rigid ideology of what you can and can't say. And the, the behaviors which they, they engage in enforcing these things. I think it's preposterous. And I think that ultimately what's going to happen is you're not going to have these kind of structures, these, these, these places where people go and you're going to be learning things online.

Speaker 2:          01:33:34       It's going to be a lot worse before it gets better. And the hard thing is that many of your listeners are not in academia. And when we tell these stories, people, they think that this kind of just making this too, you are an academia. So explain it from a first person perspective. Um, so I give, give you an example. Okay. So I had uh, an individual and class and the individual is not even part of the class and they'll write in the syllabus. I put in this entire class as a trigger warning. Like the whole thing a to z. You had to write that. I put it in. They, so if you're going to trigger warning right in the syllabus, the whole thing, I love the fact that you even use trigger warning trigger warning you so fucking stupid. I did the whole thing. We'll see.

Speaker 2:          01:34:16       Here's what happens. Cause I was actually just brought up in charges again. And if you don't do that then you know, people can say, well you didn't warn me. Well actually I did. I wondered the first day, it's an Ita. None of these in the syllabus. I'll say this [inaudible] it's bold in caps in the syllabus, in increased font. So everybody knows your class is a trigger warning. Yep, Yep. The whole thing, the whole thing. And you know, when I, I went to the dean or whatever and he's questioning about things and I'm like, and I said, you know what? Hey, it's in the thing. And he said, well, can you see how people could be offended by this stuff? And I'm like, of course people are gonna be offended by everything you mean fit her. Bailey, I talked with you talking about the woman who's offended because darth vader was black, right on MSNBC. The Dave Rubin

Speaker 3:          01:34:57       tweeted today, right? Which is one of the dumbest fucking things I've ever seen in my life. She's saying that star wars is racist because darth vader's black. Meanwhile, darth vader is not black. They took the mask off. You'd dump con it's a white dial into there. So I'm an idiot. I'm not going to say I can trump that, but let me give you a couple examples. Look, skywalker's his son too. And that's another white guy. You fucking idiot. So here's one. So this woman is in the class and I give a class at the end of the end of the class, she says, I've never seen so many microaggressions in, I think it was nice to class, uh, knowledge, values and rationality. We use Sam Harris's book, the moral landscape in that class. And we talk about, well, we talk about heavy things. You know, we talked about Isis, we talked about cultural relativism.

Speaker 3:          01:35:42       We talked about is there a way to make a cross cultural, I mean, we're talking about things that frankly, people in college should be talking about, right? Because they vote their citizens in a democracy and they need to engage these issues. And College professors are petrified. They're just in, in a sense, I understand that because it's a theft of one's time. My case, I don't care because I have no opportunity. I was told point blank that you'll never get promoted. You could publish 10 books from Harvard and we won't promote you. So once I found that out, I said, well, I can talk about whatever I want, so why did they tell you? Well, let me fit, I'll finish. So, um, so it was really interesting to me. So she, she gets up and she said, I've never been so microaggressed the guys, you know, racist.

Speaker 3:          01:36:24       This is someone that again was not even the class, there was not even in the, in, in the class. And you know, I, I thought, wow. Like what my first, it was like, is this person totally insane or did I say something that was really horrible? What were the micro aggressions that she was citing? Oh, well I focus in the racist part. So I said, well, what did, what did I say? What did I say? Because if I said something that was racist, I really do want to know cause I don't want to be that kind of person. So that's their belief revision thing again. Right, right. Okay. So she said you used the example of star trek in a class and you were shocked when the woman, when she, she pointed the woman, she didn't know she was right. I was shocked. I was genuinely, I was almost flabbergasted that she never heard of star Trek. Like I understand not watching it, but she never heard of it. And then I used the example, the example of Marilyn Manson, right? She said that you assumed that she participated in white culture.

Speaker 3:          01:37:23       So that's racist. Okay. Now I, so yeah, so for Marilyn Manson is white culture. Yeah. Okay. So this is a white guy. So now we can really drill down in this and think about this. Can to find a forum, black fans of Marilyn Manson, I'm sure it's out there. Go to read it out for forum. So now we can really unpack this insanity. Okay. So, so she, she tells people that everybody should file a complaint against me. And I said, okay, well you know, well let's, if you, you look, anybody is free to free to file complaint. Do you have the number? I said, would you like, we'll put it around on the board and you want to have a conversation with me? She said, no, you're too far gone. You're too far gone because you like start or you mentioned star trek far. Well, I don't know.

Speaker 3:          01:38:03       See that's the thing. It's like the horse analysis and run one lane. It runs off furiously in all directions. And the whole thing is main thing that people do though, they say, I can't discuss it with you. You're too far gone. That's a symptom. That's a symptom of space. Safe spaces, trigger warnings and microaggressions in your mind that goes in, I cannot speak to you will not get infected by your horrible ideas which come from Satan. You are too far gone or repent. Repent. Peter. So, so here's, I mean, this is what she's saying. It is very, it's very similar. It's very similar on the left. So what you're saying. So here's what's happening. So she black by the way, cause it'd be awesome if she was white. No, she was his, she was Hispanic. Dammit. So one of the things that that she was, or maybe not, I didn't know, she said her name was [inaudible].

Speaker 3:          01:38:53       She rolled her eyes. I don't remember what, how dare you racist the in the first name is Inigo Montoya. The first thing I said to her is my literally when she told me her name and said, I'm sorry if I can't pronounce it, but he caught a mundo bond. Okay. So here's what's interesting about that. Okay. So obviously she's been inculcated, she is incapable and I never want to pay pick on her because in a sense she's just a victim, right? She's a victim of this malicious ideology that's running across campuses now. But people like that are not capable of engaging and entertaining ideas because they have this, the university protects them. They can say they've been aggressed. They can, they can say they've been kind of violated, if you will, like cognitively intellectually violated. But what's really interesting about that? Two things. One, she thinks that she can arbitrate everybody else's reality.

Speaker 3:          01:39:51       So she thinks I can understand if I say something and he's offended by it or I say, you know, taekwondo and so like, but she thinks that the regressive thinks that they arbitrate people's reality and they know what other people should be offended by, which is amazing. But here's the really interesting part. I Love Star Trek. I'll show you my, my daughter in a sec. Offscreen, I love Star Trek. I'm the j clean. No, but she's Asian and know star Trek. It has everything to do with paws. It has, it has everything. That pause was the emphasis. It has emphasis. It has everything good because the woman, the woman I was shocked, hadn't heard of star Trek was Asian. You said she was? No. Who had heard of Star Trek? It's a different woman now that there were two women. One was the woman who said she's never been so offended in her whole life. And the other one, when she's, when I missed, she said she didn't hurt her, hadn't heard of it because it was white culture. So, okay. Two different people. So I haven't, yeah, I haven't articulated. There's a woman in the class. I use a structure for example. She hasn't heard of it. I'm stunned. I'm like, I can't believe

Speaker 2:          01:40:54       it. And I use a Marilyn Manson example. She hasn't heard of it. I'm shocked. Then the other woman, the regressive, the road, the one who's watching. Yeah, the one who's watching the regressive leftist says you're a racist. You know something that better if I don't remember exact words. Okay. Now I understand. I was so confused. I thought you were talking about the, the, all of these interactions. I thought the woman who is the regressive also hadn't heard about star trek. And that's, that's a problem with mark circulation. Not your understanding. Just apologize. So, uh, okay. So w w what was really interesting to me about that is that she identified that person on the basis of her race, not me. She was assuming she made w when you're a hammer, everything looks like a nail. When you're a regressive leftist, every single thing you think of as race, gender, oppression, intersectionality, which is parenthetically, I have never heard their sectionality.

Speaker 2:          01:41:46       Anytime you, you, you see sectionality, what does that, anytime you hear someone use that word, you can automatically assume they were aggressive leftist and the next thing out of your mouth they're most will be some kind of smear campaign. There's a hilarious video of Steven crowder going up to people and asking them what their preferred pronouns are. I almost retweeted that, but I thought, you know what? I got to get in trouble for right now. I know that, but that's what it is. They have really infested the highest levels of academia and it's funny, these diversity offices, they report directly to the president like they, they are offices in search of tasks, but back to this example, so she was the one who identified the person on the basis of their race. She identified me on the basis of their race of your race because somehow somehow there's, there's a thing called white culture.

Speaker 2:          01:42:36       She knows what it is. She's offended on someone else's behalf. I'm a white CIS gendered heterosexual, cisgendered use that term. Uh, okay. Are you being forced to use that term? Is that real? Okay? It's a question of being, how's that work? It's like, is that a question of being forced to use it? But, but, but that's not a real term. Like that's not in any dictionary or bullshit nonsense. But CIS gender is hilarious. And the idea being that you shouldn't have to say transgender because transgender should be normal. It's normal to want to be transgender. It's like it's, it's so normal that by saying transgender, you're making it abnormal. So I should say sis gender for people who aren't transgender. Meaning if you are a male and you identify as being a male, you are a cis gendered metric. You're fucking mail. Like we're, we're adding all, here's the thing about look, adding all this extra shit to define things that are already defined by the original word. We don't need that. You're doing it to prop up transgender. Like that's the idea to make it so it's even, we'll put sis regular gender trans with, right. So now, so, okay, if that was another

Speaker 3:          01:43:52       great explanation. So now why do these people do this? Well that's a long story, but one value that's responsible for that is radical egalitarianism. Everything has to be radical. Everybody has to be equal. Yes. Interesting though. How, you know, and then they have these diversity initiatives and diversity requirements. We need more faculty of Color. And I actually think that that's, that can be a good thing in some circumstances. Uh, so, but what they mean is they mean diversity and the most narrow, bigoted kind of a way they mean it in terms of skin color. They don't mean it in terms of ideological differences. They're not enough. They're hiring, you know, uh, Republicans and Libertarians or conservatives. But the other thing that's interesting is that, you know, I think it was, it was a on Sam's podcast with Douglas Murray. He said, we're going to be talking about pronouns to the big thing.

Speaker 3:          01:44:39       Now we're going to be talking about pronouns. While these people are still sneaking nukes in our cities. It is a failure to Morley triage. It is a, it is a system wide failure. That's, that's trickled down to individuals within the system to make it almost impossible for them to make discerning judgments about things. And so we have this consequence now have an entire generation of students who's being trained not only to suspend moral judgments, but to think they're better people of as being a result. And it's also beautiful. This is all coming from academia because if you think about what a university as an academia, like a lot of people that are in academia, I went to college, went on to Grad school, got their masters or their phd, started teaching, never entered the real world, stayed in a sheltered environment and now they're dictating this sort of behavior and thinking it's like, it's like a Dojo in which they never, it's everybody's training with everybody else in the Dojo, right?

Speaker 3:          01:45:37       I told you it's all mushy. Like the whole thing can be seen through that Lens. And then that this radical ideology coming in this area and wanting to redefine reality. Absolutely. In this area, they're not, they're not going out into the real world and experiencing the Congo and all this crazy fucked up parts of the world and understanding like you're dealing with like an inherent problem with the human race. Like you can't redefine it by changing pronouns and CIS gender. It really is the most insidious form of Cultural Myopia. Like they think they have latched onto some times they just making shit up. They think they've latched onto some universal truth about reality and now they have this moral and I think that the, the moral underlying moral impulses that they have a pretty good ones. You know, you don't treat people differently on the basis of their licensing or you'd be basically a cool person. You will be asked. Yes. I think that those are there being a laudable and forcing it. They're not enforcing it with kindness and compassion and understanding and trying to promote this like positive thing. Now they're shaming and docs. So that's the other piece that we need to understand here. The other piece is

Speaker 2:          01:46:50       the tactics and the techniques and these people have really done a number on me or they have attempted to they, they mistake me for someone who gives a shit. I really don't care. But the other thing is these people are just the most mean spirited, nasty, vituperative operative. Tam, you ever heard that one? No. It goes to the google that Google that vet to v VI. T. P. R. I. T. I. Tiv Vituperative. It means like, you know a nasty name calling son of a bitch. I'm going to call someone that one day. Wow. The two operative like it. There you go. Bitter of your day. Oh, like it. That's a good abusive or Tuper to fuck you can. These people are also characterized by the strategies they use with when they are engaging people. The smear tactics, if you say anything, if you question or you challenge your racist, you're a bigot, you're a homophobe.

Speaker 2:          01:47:48       But what that does is that shuts down the conversation. That's the end of the conversation. So they have marginally, it's, it really is that not only are they marginalize you, it's this rise of the victim culture, like every like victims or esteem. Now I think I can find parallels when I was talking about again with mixed with martial arts is that like the Dojo to me was sacred because this was something that was transforming me and changing me from a loser to someone who had like a possible outcome that was positive that I had potential. I don't want a path out. I think a lot of these people, they come from environments where maybe their parents were fucked up or racist or dumb or they didn't like their life or they've been raped or some kind of physical trauma. Yes, that's a good point. Um, had horrible experiences with bad people or you know, and you know, maybe abused in highschool, bullied, fucked with, and now they found some culture where they're being not just accepted, but the, the, it's, it's invigorating to them like other, and then we're going to change this world and we're going to make things awesome for people and we're gonna, you know, we're going to make you ask people what their preferred gender pronouns are.

Speaker 2:          01:49:01       This is so important. We really need to get on right. And they're there. They're living in this environment. And again, you're dealing with a really young people like, like I was when I was young and I was looking at this, this stage of my life is this transformative journey that I was on and I was wholeheartedly dedicated to it. Maybe that's what they're doing. You know, this is their transformative journey. Yeah. I think that's right. And I wasn't going on others. Yeah, they're imposing it there. They're using the mechanisms of the university to impose those things. I think that's right. But the very things that we need reason and rationality or liberatory, they can liberate us. They can emancipate us. You know, again, Jujitsu is like that. You can test ideas, you can, you know, it's like, it's a son of a bitch to have a guy had a guy on

Speaker 3:          01:49:47       me, he's like 300 pounds and he's like knee ride me and then skull riding me. I mean, it's just not a very pleasant experience. Those both sound very gay and be riding a skull riding. That's a microaggression is a micrograph. So I wanted to get back to that, that protest, because I don't think we completely finished it. I was going to finish the thought that it was, give me the protest. W This woman that was saying all this stuff about you that you know you're racist and that you're like, yeah, okay. So you know, I used the word hurtful before. So one of the reasons that's really hurtful to me is because my daughter's Asian, right. And now as the age of twitter, and that's like saying I'm not racist. I have black friends. No, no, no. It's different getting, I know you're kidding, but, but, but just think about, just think about it for a second.

Speaker 3:          01:50:34       You know, like my daughter grows up and this person in my class at, Oh, you know, he's like hates Asians or whatever, Asians, I just like to guy like star Trek, right? So, so you know, those things tend to have a life of their own and then it's like, oh, but Goshen, he's the guy who hates Asians, right? He's the guy. Whereas, no, I'm just the guy who, and this is the earlier point, I was going to make the very thing that these regressives one of the things that they don't understand, uh, perhaps the most important is that reason is liberatory w we can emancipate ourselves through reason and rationality, but the only way to do that, the weight, that reason acts as a lubricant is in social discourse. Like we need to be able to have conversations. It's non negotiable. Free speech is not a negotiation 100%.

Speaker 3:          01:51:23       It is pure. And so these people, they want to disinvite people if they don't agree with them as opposed to having, you know, uh, an alternative speaker for their point of view or debate. I'm not a fan of debates but you know, or debate. But what they want to do is they want to shut down the discourse, but let's take that at a deeper level and take a look at that. Part of the problem with that is, is that I firmly believe, and I think I have evidence for this, overwhelming evidence actually is a pedigree and long pedigree in western intellectual thought. We can derive our values, we can sit down and I can talk to you and we can figure out and looking at the black statue there, Hendrix there, we can figure out why we shouldn't discriminate against people in the basis of their skin color.

Speaker 3:          01:52:08       But the only way that we can do that, it's not matte, it doesn't come from a want, is, is that you need to be able to ask questions, right? So we can figure things out in discourse, in dialog. That's how we figure things out. And these people want to shut down discourse. But if they do that, then they become their own enemies. They're the worst type of idealog because they have beliefs, but they haven't derived those beliefs. So then those beliefs are then sacred, right? Yes, yes, yes. And the only way they're, they're taking away the one thing that we need to figure to figure stuff out. It's like they're in Jujitsu. They're taking away the resisting opponent. In this case, they're taking away the dialectic, the dialogue, free speech, open inquiry, the ability to say things on campuses without being smeared as a racist or a homophobe or a bigot.

Speaker 3:          01:53:00       You're 100% right. You're 100% right. You couldn't be more right about that aspect of this whole dilemma that they are trying to stop the debate because I think part of them knows what they're doing is ridiculous. Just like the the Ci Gong master that wants to shoot you across the room when there's a question, they kind of know they've got to know the question. Right. So that is what I've really been thinking about. Do they know that their ideologies are bankrupt? Do they know? I mean, and, and again, I'm thinking about guys at the top, like Reza, Aslan, green. Glenn, Glenn Greenwald, Jank from the young Turks. Like when you have to make shit up and lie, it makes me think that you're not genuine about your beliefs, that you're not authentic. Like I would just mention to someone the other day, I have no problem talking to someone who tells me with total sincerity, hey, you know what?

Speaker 3:          01:53:57       I believe that there was a talking snake. Like I can have a conversation with that guy. He's sincere, that Whoa, that person's sincere. They're, you know, they say this is what I believe, but the regressives you can't, it's almost impart the one thing you need. You can't have a conversation. Cause if you ask a question, you're, you're smeared you, you become a whole smear campaign. So it's incredibly frustrating on an individual level. But then when they have institutional support of this stuff, then when they have woven their tentacles into academia in, into, you know, very high positions and it's across the United States, western Europe. And again, remember there is a hierarchy of things you can't talk about. You know, th there is and if you want to figure something, if you can figure out the relationship, you mean this would be epic. You figure out why.

Speaker 3:          01:54:53       I love my freedom of language with you here on the show and you figure out why of feminists are in bed with Islamists. And then we got something because this to me is one of the most bizarre, fascinating, disturbing, grotesque. I mean, if there were ever a group who actively, I mean, you know, it's even worse than the form Baltic states and the Soviet Union who, the only military alliance in history, their primary objective was to attack themselves. This is even worse than that. I mean these people, you could not possibly find a group of people who are more antithetical to the most rudimentary feminist values than the Islamists. It is not possible. Never has it existed, but yet these people are in bed with each other and it happens over and over again. I mean, this situation where you're laughing,

Speaker 4:          01:55:44       it's awesome. I mean, it's true. It's just, it's the poetry of the bizarre. Yeah, it is. It's, it's, it's, it's some bizarre folly. It's very strange. It's very strange, but it's they're brown and you that you can't, that's part of the bad about Brown people. You can openly mock Christians. Yeah, that that's right you, you can, you can mock Christians. There's something about a skin color that that trumps other things to think about that for a second. These people, the only people who care, this isn't my line, I read this somewhere, but the only people who care about race are racists and regressive leftist. These people are, look, the regressive left really are the new racist. They were really looking at everything in terms of race and sex and I think there's a lot of sense of sex. There's a lot of sexism in the regressive left because they don't really like men and there's a lot of anti unmasculine ideology that gets perpetrated on people.

Speaker 4:          01:56:41       The point where you thinking like you're supposed to be more soft gendered, gender supposed to be a fluid thing, like you're not supposed to be overtly masculine. That's nonsense. How come you can be overtly feminine once you become transgender? How come? How come you, if a woman wants to wear like a pushup Bra, have our tits poking out in a short skirt and high heels and a lot of makeup and do her hair up. That girl's giving into the patriarchy, but if a transgender does it, you go, girl. If a transgender man all of a sudden adopts those traditionally feminine views, it hypocrisy. But it's even worse than hypocrisy because if it just stopped there, it would be something. But it's this idea that these people, they think that they can dictate to other people how they should live. Yeah. When you see a guy who's a power lifter, okay.

Speaker 4:          01:57:31       Some big fucking giant, like you know that game of thrones, the mountain guy, the mountain guys. I met that guy. That's why I didn't say hi to him. I saw him. He was at the UFC this past weekend. He's a fucking gigantic man. It's huge. He a whole thing with conor mcgregor. Yeah. Yeah. It's awesome. He obviously likes being fucking huge. He enjoys picking shit up and moving it around. He enjoys breaking records. What do I give a fuck? Why would I care? He seems like a nice guy, like the idea that this it, even if he's an Asshole, what? Well, here's the thing is, but he's, he doesn't seem to be, and that my point is like there's no, he's, he's not doing anything terrible like, but you would look at that and decide that this person living their life in this way is negative. That he's masculine and he's a part of the problem and rape culture and all this Jay. No, he's just picking big shit up and moving it around and flexing the most innocuous thing, right? That blood could do. Well, why is it mean? Why is it because he's overtly masculine? Why is that bad? Like what if he just put the same amount of energy into swimming and this guy just like to swim across the fucking ocean? Would you freak out about that? No. It's like, it's, it's this feeling, this guy is becoming this thing that you find impressive even if he's not doing any of that yet.

Speaker 3:          01:58:46       So, so it's ticked. So they're already a logs. We got that and they subscribe to ideas that are just not in accordance with reality. And I think, and I'm not using the term regressive here, I think general liberals in general tend to believe that if we can change social system somehow and, and, and I, I think that there's a lot of truth in this. Uh, Steven Steven pinker kind of, uh, in the blank slate, deconstruct some of these ideas, but liberals kind of think if you could only change the institutions in society, then things would by definition be more fair and more equal. We're all born blank slates and you know, it's all of these disparities and inequality has come about as a result of, uh, problems within the system despite inequalities when the system and this look, unless you are really an ideolog on the right, you would be hard pressed to say, you know, why, why shouldn't we try to do our best to create systems of justice that are more fair?

Speaker 3:          01:59:45       I'm a big Fan of John Ralston. Any reasonable person would say that, but these people, they don't believe in differences be, they think that they're, they're non bile. The differences between men and women are not biological. They think that their cultural artifacts, they think that, you know, and I don't know if you want to get the whole race thing, but the race thing is another thing. But they think that race is only skin deep there. It's a social construct. You know, rather than saying, well, why do Jewish women get [inaudible] syndrome? Wider Black Guy, black people get more sickle cell anemia. Um, but again, you know, I, I notice my hesitancy in discussing these things because I know that anytime you bring this up, this is an opportunity for people to smear. You tell you you're a bigot, a racist or a homophobe and, and, oh, and it's also the pinnacle of identity politics where the things that I say are discredited or they look at me because I'm, I'm situated in the body than I am for the sexuality.

Speaker 3:          02:00:45       I had no choice over whatsoever. And they used that as an opportunity to discredit my speech. I mean the whole thing is just, it's, it is literally if you could say, well let's, let's make a list of all the things that we can write down to make it impossible to solve our problems. These people, they have the list. I mean they have the gold standard for the list. Yeah, it's a very good point. I mean I think one of the most important aspects of this is what you said about silencing debate and that debate and discussion

Speaker 4:          02:01:17       is the only way we figure things out. And I don't know, I've met you today. I know you because of your work. I know you because of your associations with friends of mine, like Sam Harris. But I don't know your thinking until I talked to you and when I talked to you I go, oh, okay, I see how he sees that. Or he sees things in a different way and it's hard for people to do that because we have this rigid set ideas that we have

Speaker 2:          02:01:40       in our head and we would like to reinforce those on everybody because it makes life simpler. Well, if you think the way I think, and I think the way you think it's perfect, right? So that's when we bring Jujitsu and again, right? So that's why the problem is when we hang out with people who only believe like we do, it's called the filter bubble. Uh, and the, and it's a book about it called the beat big sort. We tend to be more confident in the beliefs that we have, right? But what we should be doing is we should be going to different gyms, right? You should be going as your buddy to 10th planet, you should be going and checking out different things because you need to test these ideas to see if they work in the same way we should be listening to ideas.

Speaker 2:          02:02:20       It's a problem if you're a liberal and you only listen to liberal stuff or an atheist and you only listen. You really need to listen to challenge and engage yourself by opening yourself up to these experiences and starting with the possibility that you could be wrong. So if you're a black belt in Brazilian Jujitsu and you walk into someone's school and the blue belts are routinely tapping you do, you got to do some thinking. Yeah, you're going to be honest with yourself and it doesn't matter how much time you've put into it, it doesn't matter what your commitment is, what matters is what works. Yeah, that's it. That's it. And that is a beautiful thing about high level problem solving in martial arts that if it works, it works. And it's, it's hard to do that when it comes to ideas like compassion and justice and getting along and how you should treat people and how people should be accepted.

Speaker 2:          02:03:12       And you know, there's, there's things about diversity and about a quality that I think we all agree with. I mean I think you shouldn't be judged by your sexuality or what you look like or where you were born or you know, fill in the blank. Nationalism seems to be kind of fucking silly to me. I think you should judge people on how you behave and how you interact with each other and be like, do I enjoy talking to this person? And guess what? You might enjoy talking to me, but somebody else might fucking think I'm a moron. They might not like talk to me. And that's their prerogative to. They can. You don't have to just because you like Peter Boghossian. Just because you enjoy people, it doesn't mean I have to enjoy them. You know, I have friends that have friends. I can't fucking stand, you know, and I'll be around like, oh Christ, why are you hanging around with this guy?

Speaker 2:          02:04:00       He gives me headaches. I gotta get Outta here. And the the older, yeah, the older I get, the more I, I just want to spend my time with people. I really want to spend money and not obligations. You can't fix people. I've tried so fucking hard to get along with people that are unmotivated or lazy or they have constant problems in their life. They don't look at themselves objective Lee. And you talk to them about things that happen in their life and they have a fucking myriad of excuses. It's overwhelming and that you, if you have those people in your life, they will overwhelm you with their issues and you will never get anything done. And so my take is try until you can't try and then get the fuck out of there. Yeah. And you, you're already doing what you're doing. And is that you're modeling those behaviors.

Speaker 2:          02:04:44       You know, when my, I was just talking to my buddy the other day, he's, he's upset that all their aggressives are attacking him. And I just said, just, I'll publish everybody. No, that's the currency in academia. Like what do you care, like just publish and explain your thoughts in a way that will inspire debate and aspire thought. Explain your thoughts in a blog in a way where people can read it and like it and share it with friends. And that's one of the beautiful things about today is that you have this ability that's never literally unparalleled access to other human beings. It's never been like this where you could just write something. You put it on facebook. You could be a carpenter in Kansas and you write something beautiful on facebook and it'll be shared across the world within minutes. Yeah. I'll add one more thing to that and don't treat people if you've been treated negatively by people. Don't stoop to that. It's hard. Right? It's hard for people. Yeah. My Mentor, my mentor, this is somewhat of a of a non sequitur, but my metro told me this really fast Dalai Lama story. No, no. The Pope No. Did the one that just got rid of right. Then what? The child molester pope, he told me he was a, he's 97 and he's a survivor of a book involved. Yeah. It's a really amazing guys that Phil about his life and he went back and liberated the same, yeah, same

Speaker 3:          02:06:07       concentration camp told me the story about chickens. That was a very profound in my life. Basically. I think he was on the study. If not then, but it doesn't make a difference. Basically they, they wanted to see if they could reverse the pecking order among chickens. And there's something that's a literal pecking order. And then if you put chickens in a coop, seven chickens, chicken, one will peck chicken to chicken, one would pet chickens two through seven but never be picked chicken too will not pet chicken one. But we'll pick, check it patrick. So the same thing all the way down. Chick chicken seven gets packed by all the chickens and pex nobody. So they wanted to see if they could reverse the pecking order. And I think that this story has profound implications for all of life. And so what they did was they put a little color, they put little collars on all the chickens and when the chicken raised his head as if it was going to pack into the chicken, they zapped it.

Speaker 3:          02:07:01       Now here's the question to you, and I got it wrong. When he asked me, do you think it was easier to make chicken one chicken seven or chicken seven chicken one chicken seven chicken one. See, that's what I said. That's wrong. And here's the reasoning for that chicken seven has been, has been, I'm not plugged duct correct peck, peck, thanks has been pecked at whole life. It's, it's, it's all only going to get packed and only takes one shock. And I'll tell you another very quick story. It only takes one shock of chicken, one to make a chicken seven instantly. Really? Yeah, because it's never experienced that. That's why, for example, in the criminal justice system, harsh punishments don't work. They just don't. And that's borne out by overwhelming empirical evidence. But I think a theoretical background for that is the chicken story. That's why like my, he was telling me that when his son, he never yelled at his son is a funny story looking at you with all the tattoos and his son wanted to get a tattoo and he slammed his hand down and he said No.

Speaker 3:          02:08:03       And he screamed and his son was so shocked. It was like such a shocking thing because he had never raised his voice. He always been chicken one, you know he had always been, but when you really start to think about the implications of that, of what kindness will do, of what, of why being, there's your word again for two creative, nasty, harsh to people. The best way to change moral attitudes is through rapport. The best way to help people, and if you read the the Christian books, they talk about this interesting book called tactics and the main thing is, you know, develop relationships with people. They're friendly, they're kind, they're trustworthy of communities with people and that gets them involved in their community and thus their faith based blood. Same thing with Jujitsu. I have like some great guys I was just hanging out with the other day who do Jujitsu.

Speaker 3:          02:08:54       Jujitsu is also interesting just parenthetically because you have such a trust of the people you work out with. I mean you have a bond. A buddy of mine is a prosecutor for the state and you know how you have to say, Hey, I know this guy. When he knew another guy who's also a friend of mine and they did Jujitsu together and he told the judge and the lawyer and they said they have, they don't have a problem with it. Neither one of those people do Jujitsu. Right. Because there's no freaking way that I would let someone do Jujitsu, sit on a jury with somebody else who's either the prosecutor, the defender, because those people trust each other because you have to trust each other when you do Jujitsu or people will break your arm still choke deck. You're also part of a very tight knit and unusual community.

Speaker 3:          02:09:39       Absolutely. You have this bond with each other that I don't think people understand your, your practice and killing each other. Yeah, that's right. Yeah. You're practicing breaking each other's arms. Yeah. So I think that that, that chicken story, and I told that because often we think that the best response to be when, when we're being mistreated or we perceive an injustice or unfairness just to lash out and a type of emotional maturity is just to not lash out. You know, maybe a really good strategy which I've adopted instead of, it's certainly much easier than, than attempting to do the emotional work of being kind and compassionate is just, just ignore people. You don't have to meet their nastiness with nastiness. You just walk away. Well that's a good approach. If he could pull it off, sometimes people get pissed off, told you like fuck this guy. Ah, but I think that also is what I call the battery effect. And it's also a good aspect of Jujitsu. I think beings have

Speaker 2:          02:10:34       a certain amount of energy that they store up in their body because I think we have, our bodies are, we have this ancient structure that it's been passed on from generation to generation, thousands and thousands of years of human beings. And for the most part up until really recently you were constantly engaged in physical activity and conflict and your body is designed for that. And I believe your body has a certain amount of requirements for the expenditure of energy. And when you don't meet those requirements, your battery overflows. And I think that's what road rage is. And I think that's what, uh, irrational responses. And I know personally from my own experience in my own shortcomings when I have had irrational responses is because I have not maintained my body correctly and I have not taken care of that battery. And then when it comes up, especially when you're someone like me, it's even more consequential because I've done it my whole life.

Speaker 2:          02:11:26       So my whole life has been about exploding, punching, kicking. I'm just all look kettlebells, Jujitsu, there's all this, Rah, Rah, Rah, Rah. And in doing that, if I get it out of my system, I'm tranquil. Everything's calm. But when I don't get out of my system was about my body. It's like, I think this is an opportunity to go fuck a class. You got all this extra, you know what I mean? It's like if you bought, he's like, come on bitch. You're like, it's, it's stored up. You've got too much juice in your battery. And Jujitsu people for the most part are some of the most mellow, calm and relaxed people outside of it. They also have the benefit of knowing that the average person literally has no idea how to defend themselves. We know this because we have been personally humiliated as an average person going into Jujitsu and then you become a practitioner and you become fairly proficient and then you understand your limitations, but you also understand much more deeply the limitations of the average person.

Speaker 2:          02:12:21       Absolutely. No, you, you haven't. Having an at from my perspective and encyclopedic knowledge of martial arts and lineages and people in my experience, the people I've met like, like, uh, you know, um, I'm trying to think of, uh, um, John Kavanagh I'd be a good example. He's a very, very deep, have you ever role with John? No. He's very good. Like he's extraordinarily good. I'm sure he is. Yeah. He's a great guy. He's a super good guy. The people you meet who are just the most dangerous, deadly people, they're just, they got nothing to prove. Yeah. They seem to be the nicest people you ever met Marcella Garcia? No. He's the sweetest of sweeties. He's just like a smiling, happy assassin. Yeah. When you're around him, he's so nice. He's just such a nice guy. And Yeah, when you're around them, my friend Eddie Bravo is fucking nicest guy ever. He's always nice. Yeah. And then, and then as I went out to a bar a little while ago, and a guy had a black belt around his waist as a belt and he was playing pool and I thought to myself, this guy has some issues. It was a dangling a, you know how you tie a belt around a g? He was tied it around his pants like that. So like, like the, the, the two were dangling like

Speaker 4:          02:13:31       a black belt with me. So he wanted to let everybody know that he's a black belt. You know, you just buy a black belt. That's the other thing I tell people, like, like you can get a black belt from like online, you buy them and then they come and then you put it on. Like you don't have to earn it. It's not like, it's like a sacred forging ground, black belts where there's only one way to just pay a lot of money. You don't even have to fucking do a fantasy martial art. You could just be a regular guy or a black belt. I mean, you literally can, there was a video really recently. I mean, it still does happen to this day. If some guy showing up at a Brazilian Jujitsu school, he puts on a game, I think he had a wrestling shoes on and a black belt and a, he showed up at this gym and he started a working out with people.

Speaker 4:          02:14:12       And then the instructor realized immediately that this guy was not a black belt and humiliated him and punish him and tell him to take the belt off and get the fuck outta here. And he was screaming at him. But see, that's the beauty of Jujitsu too, is you can't pretend, cannot pretend. Yeah. You can pretend in some martial arts, I mean there's guys that invent moves that they think, like with this, one of my favorite videos as these guys in Harlem, it's not videos. There's a series of them who practice some, some sort of fake Kung Fu. And like one guy will, uh, will be like, he'll throw a punch and then the other guy will go, well if someone does that to me when I'm going to do is, um, they, they don't say it like this. They say it in a very urban way.

Speaker 4:          02:14:54       Like not, I'm not, I'm not, that shit ain't gonna work cause I'm gonna step over here and I'm attack with a chicken wing and then I got a, I got a monkey Paul and they invent all this stuff on my attack your ribs for this position. And then their guys also in on it because they're also practicing bullshit. It's like, oh yeah, yeah, yeah. I see how that would work. Well, what's hilarious is sometimes these guys actually have fights and when they have fights it becomes like two kids in a fucking school yard. It becomes a, a brawl on the ground. These wind up clawing at each other and they can't do anything. There's no Kung Fu. There's no monkey paw. There's no attack the ribs with your knife point fingers and all this stupid shit. But you watch these guys do it. And me as a person who studied martial arts my whole life.

Speaker 4:          02:15:38       I know I don't practice Kung Fu, but I know what is actually Kung Fu and what is some shit that someone's making up. They're just practicing and making things up. Well, they could go to even a common food dojo and try and pretend that that stuff's real and the Kung Fu guy would go like, what are you talking about? Like this? You're inventing things. Don't you feel bad for those guys at some level? Yes, I do. I do. I think that a lot of those guys, if they had just found the correct path, would benefit greatly if they just found a real martial arts school. Okay. So here's what I think part of it is, I think that they engage, and I'm really interested to hear what you think about this. I think that they engage in a willingness to self deceive. Oh, a hundred percent yeah, 100% yeah.

Speaker 4:          02:16:24       And they, it's mutual. It's with both people. Like they, they, you know, reinforce each other. You see it in religion too though. You see that in religion? God finds a way. Yes he does. God does find a way. Meanwhile they leave and smoke crack and suck some dude's Dick people are crazy. I mean, that's what they do. They pretend, they pretend and they loved. One of the things that people love about Christians and Christians love about Christians and he's like, well, I'm a Christian. I'm a Christian too, right? They you're saying no. Yes. Tribalism. And also, I know that at least in the moment, you are going to engage in some very predictable behavior. You're going to engage in, uh, you're, you're a god feeling fear and Christian man. So you're going to behave like a god fearing Christian man, and you're going to say things [inaudible] I know where you're coming from.

Speaker 4:          02:17:09       You're not some fucking Weirdo Buddhist Zen dude who likes to do payoti now you're, you're, you're real clear. You know what I mean? I mean, so it's real clear. You like country music. Are you Luke Bryan Fan Bait to, well, of course you've got a pickup truck off course and I've got, oh, I've got a belt buckle. I've got a big belt buckle. Do you know what about your boots? Look at my boots or cowboy boots. You know, it's like we, we engage in these really predictable patterns and people find comfort in those patterns. Yeah. And we tend to like people who are like ourselves. Yes, yes. It's very much a tribalism thing and it's, it's also very much, it's, it reinforces your, like if you have a lack of willingness or ability or whatever it is to question the reality that you have been shown that you have subscribed to.

Speaker 4:          02:17:53       If you have, if you're not willing to question it and you find someone else who was also not willing to question it, there's some comfort in that. And if you reassure each other, there's some comfortable, that's absolutely right. And that's why it's so important for people to be honest with themselves. And how do, how do we promote those values of people of self honesty this way? I think that is exactly what conversations, I think this is the way you do it. And especially the conversation like this that will be heard by more than a million people. Yeah. And that's, that's the way you do it. And I mean, I'm just saying those Willem doing broom to fix in the world, but I'm saying humans talking to each other through social media, through, I want various math, I'll just throw this out now. I wonder if, you know, everyone's like, oh, you know, would come after postmodernism, whatever.

Speaker 4:          02:18:36       I wonder if this comes after postmodernism. I mean, I wonder if these truth telling conversations come after postmodernism. Why say I certainly think there's a great benefit to talking to people and having people be honest and even in an uncomfortable way where when you listened to it, it makes you think, oh, there's lights that go on in my head when I hear someone say something, maybe maybe they'll be vulnerable or maybe there'll be like introspective and almost a painful way when I hear it, there's lights that go on in my head while I go, wow, okay, I'm getting some real shit from this person and I'll find in myself these moments that relate to what this guy is saying. And I, I, I try to see themselves from this point of view as opposed to a newscaster. When someone is, uh, today in Los Angeles, we found out the hard way. What happens when you don't obey the law? There's no re

Speaker 2:          02:19:27       reality. There's no, there's, there's no human in there. This is a strip club dj coming up on the main stage. It's lexus $14 Comma cozzies order now. You know what I mean? It's like these are patterns that are not real, that people subscribe to and adopt and then perpetrate and, and they do it over and over again in the business world. Hello Jim. How's the family? Is Everything good? These patterns are like, they protect you from having to be vulnerable and real. They buy by adopting these predetermined patterns of behavior that we all are comfortable with and we all know as a god fearing Christian man, well, I'm a god fearing Christian man, myself, swap. I don't understand where you're coming from there sir. Give me a handshake right now on the, we're on the same page that what they're doing is they, they're, they're, they're removing the possibility of vulnerability and of, of reality and authenticity.

Speaker 2:          02:20:25       Yes. Authenticity is the perfect word and that, that makes me sad for them. It really does. It's, it's a type of tragedy when you get sad of the shit that I don't get sad. I get sad at cartoons. Well, I don't get set of cartoons, but I do feel the impetus to help people like that. Like I do feel that it's important that that people are laboring under beliefs about reality. Like again, fantasy based martial arts that just simply aren't true and they're wasting their time. But unlike fantasy martial arts, these people vote and these people affect decisions. They directly affect my life. Yes, yes, yes. Especially social issues comes a real problem. You know, it becomes a real problem when you start blocking people's access to certain medical procedures and deciding what can and can be done based on, I mean, look at what was happening during the Bush administration when it comes to, when it came to stem cell research, right?

Speaker 2:          02:21:18       I mean it was fucking shackled and stopped because everybody, they're gold sail bay bees and they go, they're going to kill babies and just get the stem cells from embryos and said, Satan mean stem cells from skin you fuck. And meanwhile the rest of the world, it has like advanced in progress. Do you know the Indians and South Koreans? Yeah. I mean it's just we got fucked by religious ideology. Got in the way of medical innovation. Yeah, it's Itchy I think. I think part of this is, I've been thinking about this a lot. I think part of this, a way that we can at least dent this problem is by promoting the value of honesty. Because if we promote the value of honesty, then with that comes the willingness to revise people's beliefs and we have to make it okay to say, I don't know, like I'm totally cool.

Speaker 2:          02:22:07       It's you sitting here and you talk about all these guys. I don't know all that stuff. I think that's one of the beautiful things about this new age of information is that is impossible now clearly to know everything. No one can know everything, so it's okay to say, I don't know now where it used to be a sign of you are poorly motivated, are poorly educated or what? I mean I'm not very educated. I went to college for three years. I barely paid attention and I only did it because I didn't want people to think I was a loser. I barely made it out of high school, but since that time I've read a lot of shit, have watched a lot of documentaries, I've had a lot of fascinating conversations with people and I've accumulated some information. So am I educated? Not really, but yeah, I mean I'm an educated on certain things about light.

Speaker 2:          02:22:53       I would say maybe not formally educated. What does that, you know, where, where is formality now when you have formal education? Like what's going on with your school? Wait, question. Not La sit now. All schools, all schools. What is it now? Because that's not education. You're, you're, you're being indoctrinated into this ridiculous ideology. If you're participating in that kind of shit, it's worse than it's anti education. It's like Kata. Yeah. It's in a lot of ways. In a lot of ways. It is. Um, it is just like religion and, and that's what my friend Kurt Metzger was saying about the social justice warriors. He's like, no, no, I, I've seen this. I grew up in a fucking call. I know what this is. You're telling me I can't think about it any other way. And that's bullshit. And his reaction to it is very bright. He gets angry at it and you know, and he's not like a violent guy, but he's just like, it was like, this is fucking bullshit.

Speaker 2:          02:23:45       I know what it is, is bullshit. You're, you're making me think a certain way. I'm not doing it. Yeah. And in the bigger picture of things, you know, America has been, this is a somewhat of a controversial statement, but, but we're, we're not the great superpower we used to be, but the one thing that we make for yourself, the one thing we've always had is we've had strong institutions and strong universities and now we're seeing those being undermined, at least in the humanities in general and even to a certain extent in the sciences and it, it, I don't assign it. See, I guess what I said, I think, cause I don't, I don't really know because I'm not in the sciences so I can't speak to that. But just anecdotally from what I've heard of people, but again, can't, I can't, I can't speak to that.

Speaker 2:          02:24:25       You know, I was thinking about, but anecdotally can come up with specific examples because that's where I haven't heard it interfered with except for the idea of promoting more women in science and there's some how or another, some sex. That's what I was in science. What I was thinking. So, so here's the problem with that. Why are there no diversity requirements with sports teams that will write like football teams, how come they don't need to have a certain amount of women because they want to win, but also they don't want women to get killed, right? So that's different because it's physical. Okay, well why? Why aren't they say, well we need so many Puerto Ricans here or we need so many, there aren't diversity requirements. So here's a word flight exogenous. It's like an X. I know that word. Okay, cool. Cool. So because because they want to win. In other words, they're telling you this is important to us. Anytime you impose a value on a system that is, that is winning is the value

Speaker 3:          02:25:24       and that's an marketplace, right? Right. That's a con competition. That's a free market. Anytime you say, well, you know you also need diversity, then you're making it more difficult to, to win a meritocracy is like that. Like you, you want people in a system to have in, in academia, I can tell you what those are. You need to be well published. You had works need to be cited by others. You need to have the, we have all these metrics, they're, they're pretty straightforward and you either live up to the metrics or you don't. But now this is why I was talking about the sciences. When you tried to put people in positions who are not qualified for those positions, you undermine the meritocracy. So when you're trying to put people, if you say, well there's not enough women here, we need to find more women.

Speaker 3:          02:26:09       There are not enough African American. Well enough. That's a trickier. But there, there are very few African Americans who study philosophy. If you are an African American with a phd in philosophy, may you are your gold. That is awesome. So an African American with a phd for philosophy can kind of write their own ticket. Yeah. Yeah. [inaudible] a good thing cause they want to promote more African Americans get involved in philosophy and then perhaps that will sort of engage more people doing that. Now this is now, this is a really interesting conversation that we should have. This is the kind of thing at this point in academia, we have to shut down the discourse because someone's going to be offended, but I think that's an important question because your question is basically it's a kind of utilitarian calculus like, okay, yeah. Let's say that we have, what is the, first of all, you have to look at the evidence.

Speaker 3:          02:27:01       Regressives don't like evidence very much, but we have to look at the evidence. What is the evidence? If there are more African Americans in philosophy, can they mentor more African American students, et Cetera. Of course. I would think that we would want that. That would be a good thing. That would be something that would be wonderful. The question is, does that mean that we would hire a candidate who does not, who would not be hired if that candidate had a different skin color? Right? Like that whole thing undermines the meritocracy, but the moment that you start talking about putting a diversity requirement on, for example, my discipline philosophy, in essence, I think what you're saying is it's not important. Your discipline isn't important because we don't do that when the outcome really matters. We don't do that with brain surgery. We don't do that with sports teams.

Speaker 3:          02:27:53       So we're not looking for the best candidates. What we're looking for is to bring people into these disciplines that may not have had the opportunity and that might be bad for the overall discipline. Yeah, it's bad for the overall institution. It's bad for the discipline, but because you're not finding the best people, but the idea is that you're trying to promote these disciplines in places where people aren't, as it were not represented, but also they don't have the same advantages. They don't have privileges there, don't have good as privileged as another word we talked about. So, so they're underrepresented. So we want more people to discipline in as long as that's not bad in and of itself, but we need to have a conversation about what that means. See, part of the problem with regressives is they look at outcomes instead of opportunities. We need to construct systems to give everybody, regardless of their skin color, of their ethnicity and equal opportunity and an education or the first rate.

Speaker 3:          02:28:56       And what we're seeing instead is systems being created to orchestrate or engineer outcomes produce this many black African about whatever it is, or Hispanic, whatever it is. The, first of all, it's a bad way to think about it. It's a horrible way to think about it. But the other problem is in meritocracy matters we need, we need to, if anything should be institutionalized. It should be systems that are raced, blind systems that don't look, think about it. You could also think about like this, think about the black guy who is in philosophy, who's incredibly smart and qualified. I have a student of mine, Matt Hernandez, that kid is freaking genius, like truly one in a million, like much smarter than I am. He's published off. I mean he, the kid's awesome. He's Hispanic. He's going to get his phd in philosophy, got a full ride, a full scholarship.

Speaker 3:          02:29:51       The crime. The shame is that when Matt gets in, people would say, well, he just got it because he's Hispanic. No, actually, no, he got is going to say that though. Well, no one's going to say it. They're gonna think it. Well, that's the problem. The problem is that we can't have a conversation to ask people if they're thinking about it, because if they say yes, there'll be smeared as a racist. Okay. So then how do you address the issue with inequality inside of these marginalized community? That's a great question. Look, this is what I think we need to do when you look at surveys of if people, so I think that these lines are primarily a po on class drawn upon class, which is something else no one wants to talk about instead of race. It just so happens that, uh, fewer African Americans frame it the other way.

Speaker 3:          02:30:42       More African Americans have bond born into poverty then, then white folks. That's just the, that's just a fact. We can also talk about something that's really an interesting about criminigenic factors or risk predictors. They're not what you think for people who would be violent criminals did just not what you think at all. Uh, but people try to make that a ratio issue. But when you look at these systems, when you look at these school systems, for example, um, I just totally lost my train of thought. I started thinking about race and Jimi Hendrix's photo back there. Oh, sorry. What you were talking about, um, trying to get more, oh yeah. Addressing the issue of income inequality. And so, so what we need to do is, well, we need to start thinking about opportunities. Well, the other thing is we need to think long term and not short term.

Speaker 3:          02:31:31       We need to look at the problem and be honest. And there are some structural issues with our electorate and the way that we've established politics in this country of offices of four years and then eight years in numerable. We need to have a longer term vision in a look at what this wants to be. Ah, Eh, right now we face a problem and that we're not adequately educating poor people in our country. And the majority of those happened to be black, and this is an enormous problem. This is going to come back to haunt us. But the solution to that problem is not diversity initiatives. That's the, here's the other reason why that's bad. It's not even a bandaid. It's worse. It's because people then say, well, look, this floss department, this department has so many minorities, things must be going well, actually no, they're not going well.

Speaker 3:          02:32:21       It was an artificial solution that was put in and the underlying structural inequality and economic disparity hasn't been addressed. That's a great way to put it. And what about all the poor people that live in West Virginia or Kentucky? There's families have been generations and generations of coal miners. I mean just because other white people have made it into universities and made an into certain institutions. You're being racist if you think that those people shouldn't get an equal shot of things as well. And so the way we fix it is, again, this is John rawls idea, public education in the first rate. However, every time I would say that people would say two things. They'd play identity politics. You're just what you're saying that because you're white, that gives them, that's their ticket to discredit what I'm saying. That's the, that's why people, they use that as an excuse to not listen to your arguments.

Speaker 3:          02:33:10       It's really, it's perverted. I mean it's, it's, it's really despicable. So, so, so the, so they use that. They use that idea as an excuse. So you've just said that. But the other thing that it does, I mean if you really start to think about what kind of society do we want to move to, what, what are the limits of our institutions? What, what role should the meritocracy play? Should you disrupt that? If there are racial inequalities or imbalances, these are questions we have to address. People had democracy have to address this and you cannot have fear of talking about this because someone's going to call you a racist. You just can't. So if you want to put a proposal forward that says, or an idea, well, I don't think, you know, hiring should be this way. You need to have that conversation. But there's one other issue.

Speaker 3:          02:33:59       There's one of the tactic that the regressive left use and that's the idea of privilege. They love that word privilege. Oh well you know, you don't even see your privilege. You don't privileges yet. Another thing that's used and look, I, I think the impetus for that is good. The danger here is that because these people are so nasty, so mean spirited and so generally insane that we discard everything that they're saying. We throw the baby out with the bath water and now we need to be conscious and careful that we don't do that. We need to acknowledge that they're saying some important things there. You know, racial treatment of people in the basis of race, gender, sexual orientation, not discriminating against someone because they, they don't feel comfortable in a male body or a female or Guy Mark Fisher I roll with just is a gay and has his gauges.

Speaker 3:          02:34:51       Just think these things are important. These things matter. These things are things that we have to talk about and if I have privilege, I want to be conscious of that in. If I'm treating someone in a way that's unjust or if it's unkind, I, I, I want to know about that. That's not the guy I want to be, you know, so, so how do we talk about these things? How do we, how do we engage these? Well, here's how you don't talk about them. You don't talk about them by constantly smearing people with privilege. You saying you have privilege, you're not, or Portland state my university, they had an event where students, minority students were, were, you know, could speak about all these things, but students who were, I can't remember the exact phrasing, not of color, were invited to listen. Think about that. They were invited to listen. They have institutionalized racism. That's what that is.

Speaker 4:          02:35:48       It is. It certainly racism in that sense. But isn't it an opportunity for people that have been marginalized to express themselves in a platform that maybe a lot of people that have been marginalized haven't had the opportunity? Isn't there room for people of a specific race to speak, uh, about some issues that maybe they would understand intimately that you are, I wouldn't because we're white folks. There's no question at all that that's true. And you know what I was at at bad though, to have someone have the opportunity to like, let's, let's allow African Americans speak and let's allow these white folks to listen to what they have to say. And then maybe you have another conference or maybe a debate or maybe a conversation where you allow someone to have a retort. So the first, the first problem with that is if you frame it in terms of an opportunity than if I say yes, it's bad, then it should be like I'm denying people the opportunity. So I think that's the best way to frame it. Right.

Speaker 3:          02:36:46       Uh, the problem with that one price, my buddy who's an appellate court judge, and he said one, he said he thinks it's unwise or his son actually said this, he didn't say this. His son is, uh, is a, uh, uh, uh, on the clerks for some supreme court. I don't even know what he's put some, but he has his lawyer, board certified, et Cetera, have a pass the bar. Excuse me. Uh, part of the problem is that if you do that, so I was amazed that that was legal. I'm not a lawyer, I don't pretend to be a lawyer, but he said it's actually legal. The problem is that you then need to hold than white people or whoever any other group can hold and say, look, blacks can't speak basically. So we can get in and we can talk about how great it is.

Speaker 3:          02:37:23       Good luck with that. So you're right. So you're so it's not so you, you, you're creating an opportunity for people who are genuine racists to undermine the whole system. But the other thing is like, I think it's important you can totally do that and say, look, we're going to have people for two hours speak about their experiences of oppression. I think that's great. And I think that they should do that. And I think we need to be more sensitive and I think we need to correct any structural inequalities or remove biases that we have with people. And I'm sure I still have some, I don't, I don't know of any, I try to remove them. I'm sure. I still have them. But the idea is that shouldn't people of any race then be allowed to ask people questions about those experiences? Shouldn't we then say, Oh, you've had this experiences of, you know, gang Jujitsu again, whatever it is, or being black in the academy are being, uh, like you said this, like, I don't know how to explain that to me.

Speaker 3:          02:38:13       Explain that to all know. So you shutting down possibilities for people who don't understand those. That's the way we understand things. We come to understand through asking questions like, you know, Oh, well why do you do the rear naked choke list? Why? Oh, because if you don't, the guy will pull your arm off so you put in the back of his head. So like, we need environments that, uh, encourage genuine inquirers and questions and that here's the problem so that someone could say, well, what if someone goes in there and starts shouting racial epitaphs or horrible things? Okay, well there are a bad person. Well, they're horrible. They're a file person. But that's a, that's what should be clear to everybody. And the only way that's going to be clear to everybody is if you allow open thinking, open speech and allow people to express themselves and you accumulate all that data and you get an understanding of what is okay and what's not okay, what's hurtful, what's not hurtful.

Speaker 3:          02:39:04       And if you're constantly in an environment where you don't even, you know, the monkey hear no evil, you can't even hear a bad idea when someone does something legitimately horrible, what would the reaction be? Your threshold. We'll constantly be decreasing. If you're not hearing ideas right? If you're not hearing ideas that run contrary or you know, challenging than your threshold for what you find offensive will constantly lower. So then anything will offend you. I had Thaddeus Russell on, uh, who's a great guy and he teaches at a occidental and we were talking about that, um, issue where there was a, a young man and a young woman who got together and they got drunk and they had some consent. The girl decided that, uh, either she decided, her friends convinced her into it, that she had been raped even though she had sent him a bunch of text messages saying, are you coming over? Bring condoms, told their friends I'm getting laid, lol. And uh, he had gotten to her, they were both intoxicated, but because he's a man, he was kicked off the campus. He was kicked out of school. He's, they're suing is a big lawsuit. She stayed, they both sex. There was no

Speaker 2:          02:40:13       force. There was no, there was no, no lies. There's no, no one held anyone down. No one did, did anything against anyone's will. But they had decided that he had committed sexual assault because they were both drunk and they could not consent, which is fucking insane. End Rady. Ready? Sexist. Yeah, that's right. It's sexist. It's sexist towards men. And if that's just in the pot, it just, it disempowers women. Yes, it does. It also, it's ridiculous because how come you are responsible for your own actions and every other realm? If you drive a car and you're drunk, you can't say, well, Hey, I was drunk. I'm not responsible for plowing into that fucking school bus full of kids. You can't say that. But if you say, hey, I was drunk. I'm not responsible for my consent to have sex with this man. That was preposterous.

Speaker 2:          02:40:58       We all know that alcohol limits your inhibitions. It lowers your inhibitions and it makes you do things you might regret. But there's a, there's a big thing amongst people online that are trying to say this and pass it on. Regret does not equal rape. People make mistakes. We've all made mistakes. Everyone's made was, and if you drink, you're going to make more mistakes. That's just a fact. But that doesn't mean that the person you made a mistake with is a fucking rapist. Now, they've also made a mistake and maybe not, maybe, maybe you guys just had sex and maybe you're around a bunch of fucking nutty people who are trying to convince you that anytime you have sex and you're drunk, you've been raped and there is a lot of that too loud. So I was going to say that's a cultural problem. Now look at it from the view of the administrator.

Speaker 2:          02:41:39       Right? So from the view of the administrator, students, Dell, after his job and those guys have couched jobs, man, they have cush up 300,000. They get parking spaces and everything. I mean they have parking spaces are big. Parking spaces are huge. The sign Mr. Wilson to sign it just is ready. Let me sweep it. Pulling your test Ya. Yeah. So, so the Tesla, so, so those guys, um, so, so those, those administrative guys as a microaggression, how dare you microaggressed me. So those, those folks, I prefer Z. Yeah. Oh, which is funny, a funny story. There's a story at U s s story about at the university about this. So again, I have no problem calling somebody, you know, he looks like a she or whatever you want. Hit a couple of quick stories. So I had a, I take attendance. It's long story, why I take attendance, just run with it.

Speaker 2:          02:42:34       So I get this, uh, this very attractive young woman comes up to me at the end of class. I'm kind of discombobulated, got all the shit in my head and she hands me this note. And so you can get out of it if you have a jury duty military orders, um, doctor's note, uh, excuse from my boss's boss, the dean or whatever. So in that way, and just in case I'm audited, right, if I'm audited, I can say, or I, if I say, hey, why did this person get off of this? But I didn't, you know, do anything. And then next thing you know, she's paying me, I'm sleeping with who know, it just, it's just so much easier for me. So I'm reading this note and it said, would you please excuse Mr. So, and from this

Speaker 3:          02:43:12       thing and his, his sis system is, but whatever it was. And I'm looking at this like, who's, who's, who's Mr Saul and saul and I lived as a, I don't, I'm so w is their friends, I don't know have any idealize what she's handing me this note should own. I'm, I'm Mr so and so. And it took me a second and it took me a moment. I had to like process that I didn't say anything about it. I'm like, oh, that's great. Because if I do, you know, if people do demand something and, and they'll say, well look, this person gave you this, this is not a Mr. And like you have a problem with that. I mean, I can pull the same regressive card that they can you, you're being homophobic, you're being transphobic or whatever it is. So, so people have been choosing their own pronouns. But the craziest thing that happened to a colleague of mine is he was told that, and again, I call anybody any pronoun you want, you want to be called Z. I've got no, I got bigger shit to where the h e m problem. That's three e's. I'll spell it out for you every time. Sh so, so this person wanted to be called, uh, I can't remember what the days were, but certainly

Speaker 4:          02:44:20       daisy, he, she mm. And he made it

Speaker 3:          02:44:23       mistake, my colleague made a mistake and all hell broke loose. What was the mistake? He calls pushy on the wrong thing like that. Yeah. And, and she said, you know, okay, don't do that again. And evidently he did that again or something. I don't know. So now

Speaker 4:          02:44:45       whatever happened to people just being fucking crazy. It's not an option. Is that possible? You know, I was watching a video listening to a radio lab podcast and they were interviewing this guy who got a guy. Sometimes, sometimes it's a girl, sometimes it goes back and forth and his gender is fluid and in the middle of the conversations like I just switched. I'm a guy now. I just switched. I just felt it. It was immediate. Like I'm listening to this and I'm going, well, this is a fucking idiot. Clearly this is obviously a nutty person that has a very loose, slippery mineral oil grip on reality. It's like what just flies were out of their fingers and they want you to give in to this slippery reality and focus on them constantly. Now he now mushy. It's another way to divert attention from anything that's going on and focus it on them and something completely trivial like that.

Speaker 4:          02:45:38       They decide there are female, they decided they're a male. What? What the fuck are you talking about? And I don't even, I don't even care if, if it's pointless piece feel different. Different Times of the day. If you feel different sexually, if you're, you know, you're pansexual or it's just you're just thinking too much and projecting, you're projecting that off on other people. If you really think that you become transgender, we assist gender and all like it switches back and forth all throughout the day. You're probably fucking crazy. Was it? Was it you who tweeted the link about the guy who is a six year old girl or eight year old girl is 52 year old man and a, he's a father and he has decided that now he's a six year old girl. All right. I love it. He should be a six year old fox. I'm a, I'm going to be a Fox.

Speaker 4:          02:46:27       No, I'm an owl. I'm an eagle. I identify with trees. I'm just going to stand here. Don't judge. So, so instead of, so here's, so have a hat with apple's hanging from it that don't disrespect this is real. So I think that's part of the problem with not being able to Morley triage, right? It's part of the problem with not being triage is a great way to describe it too. That's a great way to his crime. So, so instead of saying, okay, look, this guy, whatever's going on in his, her life person, that's Z, whatever, fine, great run with it. I, it's just not, it's not worth my time. Yeah. If a guy wants to be trivial world girl, you go forward. I think we have a problem with mister and misses and all that shit. How about we just abandoned it. Your name's Peter.

Speaker 4:          02:47:10       My name's Joe and make a fucking noise. That means that's like my, my, my issue with this whole Caitlin Jenner thing. Cause like you have to call her Caitlyn now. It's a shitty car. Caitlin, I've been calling this fucking person is one noise that I make with my mouth my whole life. In the Diane Sawyer interview, he said he and he said, Bruce, I'm sticking with that. You can't keep making new noises that I have to make with my face. They make you feel better about yourself because if that's all it takes for you to feel better about yourself is people call you a new noise. That's ridiculous. If I decide tomorrow, my, my new name is Sheila, I want everybody to call me Sheila. But you just laughed. That's a micro aggression. There is a microaggression. Why wide? What? Joe is a boring ass fucking stupid name and I've got stuck with that boring ass stupid name.

Speaker 4:          02:47:57       This is how boring ass stupid. My Dad's name is Joe. My grandfather's name is Joe. My grandmother's name is Josephine. Bunch of fucking unoriginal, uncreative fucks in my family. So what, it's just a noise that you make with your face when you say, hey joe to me and my, my friend Joey is right behind me and I don't know which Joe after look. Oh No, you've, you've microaggressed me again cause I don't know what Joe you're referring to. This is a noise that you make that represents you. Who gives a shit? Is it, those are some noises. They're feminine. There was some noises that are ambiguous, right? You know, like it's Pat, remember that? I'm not fucking show. We couldn't figure out what gender she was. There's women named shelly, there's men named shelly. Fuck, what are we, Chris. Christine. There's genes that are girls and genes that are guides.

Speaker 4:          02:48:39       So, so confusing. So you see how crazy that is? It is confusing. But here's what makes it worse. What makes it worse is that if you make a mistake, there's, there's a rule to punish you. Like right now you have your operating freely. You have no rules. People in people out that their pr, they're paranoid. They're paranoid about making a mistake. So of course, I mean that's just the way it is. I mean, when, when you have a bunch of people that are hypersensitive and that are trying to enforce these ridiculous ideas on people and they're trying to pound these things down, they're looking for these moments with aiken solidify. This is the moment. So they could point at you these moments where I call them green lights are called them green lights because they might not be upset. They might not really be upset, but they have a green light to act upset.

Speaker 4:          02:49:32       Yeah, there's their battery. You know, my whole buffalo battery, that's where I found one. And they have community support because now the victim is the highest level. Yeah. And they're all social retards. The other part of the problem, and I say retards, he'll like, you know, it's politically incorrect. Word retarded means slowed. And the that is socially retarded to like operate this way. It's, it's, it's slows everything down. It's, it's awkward. It's confusing. It's not necessary. What's necessary is friendship, kindness, compassion, open mindedness. And those things don't exist when you were pointing fingers at people. Right. And shaming them over innocuous things. Right. Like you, Oh, you called her a she on Thursday, right? You fuck she's he on Thursday. Right. Come on in. And this is nonsense that acts against their own interest. That creates adversary relationships. Cause then you're like, oh, Caitlin. You know, could you just make them socially spoiled?

Speaker 4:          02:50:30       I mean, that's what you're doing. That's exactly what you're doing. Yeah. Yeah. We're out of time. All right, cool. Fucking hammered it out for three hours. I don't say we've changed the Goddamn thing about the world, but a three hour thing. Yes we did. We just did three hours. Well, thank you Peter. I really appreciate it. If people want to find you on twitter, it's a Peter Boghossian, b, o. G. H. O. S. S. I. A. N. Uh, he's probably gonna be fired from his job at Portland State University after this podcast. So please, uh, you know, open up a patrion page and that's the request I call those social justice freaks. Anything else? Thank you. Thank you. I appreciate. Let's do this again.
