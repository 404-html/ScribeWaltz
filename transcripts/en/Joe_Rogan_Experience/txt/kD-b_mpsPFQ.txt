Speaker 1:          00:00:05       Three. Two, one. Happy New Year. Tom Pub. Yeah. Happy you get. Thank you for the gift. You're welcome. I've always wanted one of these. It's amazing. Really. It is. I got two things that I really don't want today. One was herpes. No yeezys you'll love him. Jamie thinks, oh love. He got me here and I said, take these bags. These are yours. Do you keep him? Hey, he came back and brought me the right size. He had cysts first. He brought me to the Bronx. What's wrong with them? That they're fucking preposterous. Let me see him.

Speaker 1:          00:00:55       Your um, Brendan Chop. They're the perfect thing because they're in, this looks like something from the nineties yeah, like some kind of shoe from the 90s. Now what level of outrage would there be if I started wearing these to run the mountains? What if they were really comfortable and you like them? I know what's going on. So you think that if I put him on, I would all of a sudden love them and I would get it. Those are street. Maybe. Are Those for the street? Does he have like a bird? He'll worthy of wake up extra hook in the back of the heel? Yeah. Like why is it go like a normal heel? Like here's a normal heels, right? Those flat flush, it's flat. It's like goes out at an angle on those two. That does too. Is the boost. It's the style of shoe. It's the bottom.

Speaker 1:          00:01:45       It's what it's of the Adidas. Is it the style or is it the uh, the shape? Is it the style or is it the feel that you really like the feel? Bubba won't both. Honestly both. But these were really comfortable shoes. The boost is super comfortable. Is this a adidas made shoe? Is that, yep. Oh, so didas makes, yeah. And there's just no adidas logo on there. So it's hard to tell that he's starting to like them starting to warm up while I weird how they have this like military style number. Yup. Thing on the side. Like some fucking Korean missile quit. Is there, I couldn't tell you what it stands for. I've seen it. Multiple things. It could just be supply or could you come up? It could be an acronym for something. I don't know. Yeah, they look like they're from the nineties enjoy them.

Speaker 1:          00:02:30       Thank you sir. Why an accordion? Like what is, are you a monkey? No, the guy that has the accordion, the monkey dance monkey dance is, I love the sound of the accordion and I just, uh, I saw it and I just wanted to bring something to the new studio. I like how you have a lot of weird shit here. And this is weird that somebody loved this sound so much that they decided let's make an instrument out of it. Yeah. Are there like real complicated ones? Those are like big to people play them and orchestras and shit.

Speaker 2:          00:03:00       No, I don't think they made it into the orchestra and so it's never been like a really respected piece of musical instrument design at Co. New Orleans Buckwheat, Zydeco. You ever hear that? Sure. Yeah. Back like, Oh papa poke a lot of Polish. Booka Zam fear master of the Pan Flute. Of course. What happened to that poor bastard? Like he had a whole marketing team behind me. Like, dude, no one's done this. No one's done this, but we're going to do this. You can master the Pan Flute, Dvds, cds, vhs tapes. We're going to sell it all. There's literally no competition. There's nothing you can do that your Zam Fair. He's the Tony Hawk of the Pan Flute, right and areas. Give me some volume with the sky.

Speaker 3:          00:03:41       Beautiful music, radio and TV. Look at the chest hair and the change. What? Gold chain around the world.

Speaker 2:          00:03:48       20 million records. What is

Speaker 3:          00:03:52       Zam fear that he will get book Tom in his magnificent, he looks like a guy that works on the jelly. That is

Speaker 2:          00:04:01       very forgettable sound. It's a recorder. It's for like window of the things you learn when you're in fourth grade and they teach them music. Yeah, that goofy flu like thing. I never, I never paid attention to the recorder because they gave me the recorder and I'll go, well how come I don't see this bands the fuck outta here. I'm not going to spend some time learning an instrument that no one place you had to though need to carry it in your sock. You remember you had to put it in your sock. They didn't even have cases. They just give you a good get old tube sock from your dad and put it in there he go be cancer. Right. No, makes a case for the fucking recorder. Now you have to put in your dad's sock and it didn't make any sense either that it was, oh, he's got it tall, but he plays a flute. Right? Well it said Pan flute when I typed it in, but, oh, flute rock. Well, he's a bad motherfucker. Yeah. JETHRO tull. He's winning crazy looking dude. He looks like he lives in a hollowed out tree. Right? He does. Oh my God. Scurries out when you walk by on the trail. I know. Has anybody else figured out how to use the flute in rock and roll music besides Jethro Tull?

Speaker 3:          00:05:16       I haven't spent some flute. There's been a

Speaker 2:          00:05:20       but not like him right now where it's not worth hard of it. The lead. He's the lead guy. Isn't that weird how like a band will come along and they'll just figure out how to do something that no one's figured out. Yeah, yeah, exactly. Now we're going to do this. Yeah, we're just going to throw a flute in the mix and then everybody's like, okay, I like it. Hey, it kind of works.

Speaker 3:          00:05:41       Should we get a flute? I was, uh, I was doing this show last weekend and this guy had an oboe. He was like the in San Francisco. He's one of the, like the oboist in the world and he's playing, this instrument is very melancholy, just beautiful. But it really

Speaker 2:          00:05:58       was occurring to me like, why, who built this, who thought this sound was so important when they decided we're going to make an instrument so we can re recreate this feeling and this sound for all those instruments and the stuff. She gave me a pen and a paper and told me to draw an Oba, I'd be fucked. Yeah. I, it was not what I thought it was. I was like, Oh, before he pulled up a picture of it, let me think of what it looks like. Well, I want to think, and I'm thinking of a trombone, I'm thinking of a thing, but it's definitely not. That was way bigger. Yeah. We'll kind of pull it up. Let me see what the elbow is straight out. It looks like a flute. Yeah, it's straight. It looks almost like a clarinet. Clarinet. That's what I'm thinking. Not a flute that looks more clarinet was pretty bad ass oboe and pop that's in waterworld not done moving. Right. That's an example of world's a terrible moving water. World's a terrible movie, but they have a damn good themed show at universal. It's very good. It's really good. But it's amazing. It's like nobody watched that fucking movie and it was a gigantic flop, but still in 2018 they put on a Jamun live show kicks ass waterworld so everybody's like, wait, wait, wait. What the fuck is this based on?

Speaker 2:          00:07:18       This is some sort of dystopian world where like everybody is drowning, right? Yeah. The water is risen to the top of everything. And then these baddies and good people and and then this done people that are risking their lives is explosions of file flying jet skis. I went to see what my salary is. Great. We got fucking drenched by the way. If you're going to go to see this good seats don't go during the cold that it doesn't matter. Good or bad seats, man, that shit goes up into the 15th 16th rose. I look at that. That is a good production value. It's great cause it's like a play, but it's fun to watch. That's it's very enjoyable. That's all Kevin Costner had to do was just do this. He didn't have to make that check. Antic movie. That movie just hopper. That movie was a, I had some friends that worked on it.

Speaker 2:          00:08:06       There were stunt people and they were just talking about the amount of money that like whenever you feel me, anything involving water, like you're fine. Everything is insanely expensive. Right? Camera's here. It's all under water, but he's water. It's wet, everything's wet. It's like, yeah, it was crazy and it sucked. Aw, it did suck. I tried to watch it actually. Basically fucking terrible movie. It's a cool idea that like the seas have risen and there you've got to either have to live on this boat. Yeah. But like he's in like a fight for his life and shit and he's going to fucking cigar in his mouth and they love those movies. Yeah. And they have weird like comedic guys and then Dennis Hopper is kind of looks cool, but it's kind of weird. I see like these guys are about to shoot him and he's got a cigar in his mouth.

Speaker 2:          00:08:51       Like, look, everybody's dirty, but it's wet out. It's like, it's like the water. You fuck dirty, stinky bitch. Just there's water everywhere. That's a great point. Why are they filthy places a tub? It's because it's a rip off of Mad Max. Yeah. Max. The dystopian Mad Max movie was made at a place with no fucking water here in the desert and a reason to be dirty. Fucking plagiarists just jump in the water. He's fighting for his life and he's got a cigar in his mouth. Spit the Cigarro Yukon. You're going to get shot. Jesus. Jesus Christ. I did like that boat though. That was a pretty cool boat that he could control. The whole thing is kind of, it's bad, but it's not nearly as bad as the postman. The Post Osman was another dystopian movie that was a colossal failure starring Kevin Costner. But Kevin Costner, who I'm not, I'm not shitting on Kevin Costner, was huge.

Speaker 2:          00:09:45       Kevin Costner Fan. I love that guy. But he, he was in a couple of stinkers to kind of shark tanked him for a long time. The Postman from 1997 is one of the worst in the history of bad. So bad that I will get high and watch it occasionally just for the fucking Yuck. I mean, never even seen this one. Oh yeah. In the field. That's CBT. Ribisi whatever's, yeah, whatever. Giovanni Ribisi you get kicked in the head there and um, in this movie, like who is he? Kevin Costner has to deliver the letters. It's like this big in the future. There's no PA post office anymore, so he's gotta be like the post man, but they're trying to kill them book. They're going to fucking get him. He's got to run across the bridge. He's like, I've got lettuce. It's got the mail. What are you doing the fuck you doing with these letters?

Speaker 2:          00:10:34       I'll go to bring them. It's important. We communicate. It's just all because of dances with wolves was so good. And I tried to like re do it. No, this is not nothing like dances with wolves. Get them back in the woods. I think this is based on a novel, if I remember correctly. See if that movie the postman is based on a novel. I think it's based on a science fixture or future fiction novel. If I remember correctly. I never even heard of that movie. Oh, it's so bad. Great. Yeah, it is man at a book. Okay. Yeah. So yeah, it's, it's crazy. It's about, I think it might be like post nuclear war or something. Who's trying to stop them? People don't like mail. Guess what year it takes place in hope. Let me guess. 2014 that's great. The other day we were looking at, um, uh, blade runner. Blade runner is 2019. Oh really? Original one was 2019. Wow. Next year flying cars robusto off. Not so well. We might make it a book loan fast. The thing is whatever does happen will happen so fast. We'll wish for something like blade runner where there's some sort of intermediate world where the technology and the people coexist, right? Because we're just to be, yeah, we're just

Speaker 4:          00:11:54       going to be plugged into it like the Matrix. It's just going to be slow and then all of a sudden it's going to be just,

Speaker 1:          00:12:01       if you go back to 1994 which is essentially when most people started logging on to, you've got mail. Yeah. That's 24 years ago. Okay. That's not a long time nets at tiny brief little moment in human history and in 24 years, the world's radically changed the way it gets information completely. Completely right now, go 24 years from now, it's probably going to be accelerated 10 fold from that point. The moment artificial intelligence happens to moment, autonomous cars started happening. The moment the boring company actually has tunnels going through the bottom of La and all of it's going to be fucking bananas.

Speaker 4:          00:12:39       I had a guy from a tesla energy at my house yesterday and uh, they bought solar city, so it's no longer this solar company. They're now tesla energy, Tesla energies now of a car, the trucks, the batteries, the power wall generators and the solar and this, this guy comes in like he's from the future. He is dressed like a future guy in this like black fitted thing, these kind of like those shoes but in white and he just kind of comes in. He's really sharp and like really clear and just goes through the thing. He's probably an adderall and her thing is that, uh, they're going to put a solar on the roofs and then you have your power wall. You're still connected to the grid because you've got to, they have to for political reasons, but their whole thing, they want to create tesla neighborhoods where everybody starts feeding off of each other. They're just completely autonomous. Tesla neighborhoods. That's a good point. Where you just said though about that it's politically motivated that the reason why they have to stay on the grid, it's the only reason. It's the only way. They don't need it, but in order to get things passed, they can like have that big battery and you're in your house. They wouldn't let that happen unless, because that really would mean that you're completely cut off. And the politicians just like, no, that's not happening. Isn't that crazy? Because

Speaker 1:          00:14:01       that's a more efficient way to do it. You're getting the power from the sun. It's cleaner, it's better for everybody. And yet they're still like, no, no, we want to keep these jobs, keep the system. We want to slow down progress. We know we don't want everybody to have to radically readjust.

Speaker 4:          00:14:17       Yeah. And the, and the costs are for energy or just going up so quickly that in like three years, what you pay in southern California, he's almost going to double. So it's three years. Really? Yeah. Yeah. Wow. Cause there's a, they have to reach benchmarks by 2020 did you see what Tesla did in Puerto Rico? No, it do. I remember him saying he was going to do this and then there was no news coverage about it, but their whole infrastructure was wiped out during the hurricane. Like completely that old electric shot. He had all these power walls, they're giant batteries about the size of the flag and they just store all of this energy like a year's worth of energy you can store. And they were about to be shipped to customers here in the u s who bought them, who want them in their house. You know his backup generators basically they're supposed to ship in January. They're not shipping now until April because he decided these people in Puerto Rico need energy, took all of those power walls, ship them to Puerto Rico and has built this new infrastructure for Puerto Rico. Hospitals are running on Tesla, schools are running on Tesla. Uh, neighborhoods are running on it. And it was this quiet little story like nobody, this is a kick ass company that went in and literally is saving this island.

Speaker 1:          00:15:40       No Sin. Fuck Oprah. We need Elan Musk to run for president. Tired of people saying Oprah the last couple of days have been hell for crazy. I love Oprah. Don't get me wrong. I think she's a wonderful woman. I think she's a powerful force of good and positive energy. But Jane, no, Eli. But she also brought us doctor Oz and the secret we have to remember with this lady has done, she has to be held accountable. I forgive her, but I mean cut the shit. The secret is a particularly egregious offense. What you don't, you just, if you don't believe, you don't believe who believe. I want to be rich. I just am rich. I imagine myself flying. I can fly. I will beat my wings until I take off what's up. Yeah, it was one of the more confused I want us to disturb, disturbing. But it was confusing when that was taking hold with people.

Speaker 1:          00:16:41       When I had friends that were telling me that the secret is real and that they imagine they were going to fulfill these childhood dreams that they had had about whatever, being a fucking astronaut, whatever, whatever it would be. And there's a couple people that I knew, they were trying to tell me that the secret was going to be the thing and that they had a vision board and they had photographs. They put pictures up of the things that they want, like them in front of large crowds and shit. And I'm like, Oh boy, this is the front of large crowds. This is so not how it works. Yeah. But there is a kernel of it that works. Yup.

Speaker 4:          00:17:18       Causative thinking, you wanting something, you envisioning it, but that's a little component and just how you live your life. It's not just sitting in your, you know what it's like and wishing it. So

Speaker 1:          00:17:28       it's like saying, I am going to be a bodybuilder because I drink water. Yeah. It's like, no, you okay. Ah Geez. Where do I start? You? You should drink water and it will help you if you want to be a bodybuilder. But I've talked to all these bodybuilders and the one thing they have in common is all drank water. And they knew that if they drank water, they would be giant. There'd be giant, huge people. It's all you've got to go. Okay, but did they also perform reps to failure? Did they also take steroids? Did they also do these exercises? Squats, dead lifts, curls, you know, did they do all that stuff too? Yes, but that but the water, why aren't you believe her? This is what it's like cause cause they're saying like no, these people, they believe that they can do these things. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:18:17       They, they, they had this vision and they focus on this vision and it came to fruition. Yeah. You know what they also did? They also busted their fucking ass and got lucky and we're in a business or career that they had some talent in and figured out what that career is and figured out how to navigate the very weird waters of social interaction and skill acquisition and success and failure and learn from your failure and luck. Yeah. That's a big problem is you're dealing with complete sampling bias. You're, you're only asking people that are in the mansions. Tom Papa, how did you do it? I mean I see you here, you have this place. It's as big as the White House. You have a giant lawn. Did judge always know this was going to be your reality? I saw it and I just put it on my vision board.

Speaker 1:          00:19:12       Obviously it doesn't stick around and be, didn't it became a fad because all these people, well at some point that's take the board down. Well and unfortunately some people died because they, um, there was a story I was reading about oprah unfortunately where this woman had terminal cancer and she, she had stage three breast cancer and just decided that through the secret she was going to imagine herself a healthy person and you know, she eventually want them dying from it because she, she didn't get treatment. The IAA I know, I mean she, she stopped traditional. She stopped conventional medical treatment. But what part of, so how far do you go with positive thinking? Cause I see you as a fellow that, uh, has goals and I would think positive thinking plays into your life. So what does that even mean? Really? Like do I think positive?

Speaker 1:          00:20:09       I, I think in a positive way. I try to be positive. I try, but when you're trying to accomplish something, whether you're trying to, you know, get better at something, like say if you're playing a game, like what if let's like golf, like say take up golf and you want to be a really good golfer. Like you start thinking about golf, like how do I get better at golf? You have to learn if to pay attention to instructional videos, you have to maybe seek out coaching. You have to play some games and lose, you have to choke under pressure. You have to examine the mental game. Like what is wrong with my mental process when I approach a shot? What is wrong with this? What is wrong with it? And then become obsessed with the, the idea of succeeding in that. And I think that that can apply to everything.

Speaker 1:          00:20:58       So yeah, I mean I certainly believe in positive thinking, but this, that was like mystic nonsense. No, that tips over and it discounts all the other stuff that you have to do. There's something to the law of attraction. It is, but it is one component to this gigantic sort of spectrum of factors that have to be taken into consideration when you're trying to succeed at something. Yeah. Positive thinking is one of them. Yeah, but it's also the understanding of how to eliminate laziness, how to discipline yourself, how to write down goals, how to, how to make incremental steps towards improvement, how to recognize failure is not just the end of all your hard work, but in fact the beginning of a new breakthrough because you understand like how to never do this wrong, wrong, the wrong way again, and the consequences of doing things wrong.

Speaker 1:          00:21:52       It's like there's a lot of, yeah, there's a lot of factors in getting better and succeeding at things and they boiled it down to the easiest one, which is dreaming. Right, right. Exactly. Exactly. And that's why it's sold. But Oprah sold it. I mean, she was, she was one of the big ones, manage. She was fucking 50 years old at the time. I mean, this is not a young woman who was selling this. How old is open now? 75 89 no, she just ran a marathon in four hours. Did she? Really? 67 63 so we ran a marathon. Yeah. So let's, let's think of when the secret came out. I want to say that was like 2006 six 2004 2006 so 12 years ago she was so she was 50 years old. How the fuck did you not know when you're 50 years old, they're worth $1 billion that that's not how it works. But it's Hocus pocus. Yeah, it's not hocus pocus. Yeah, and to sell that to people is crazy. And that's a book that's sold. I think I was reading it sold somewhere in the neighborhood of 20 million copies. Wow. Is that what it tells you on?

Speaker 4:          00:23:03       Geez, that's crazy. Well, you want an easy way. You want something that's easy. Everybody wants, you're in trouble, you're feeling whatever and they want something to come. Something come and help me. I mean that's where religion comes from. It's just please, there's that thing inside of us is like, ah, I want to believe if I believe, is that enough?

Speaker 1:          00:23:21       It is a lot like that. Yeah. There was one of trump's spiritual advisors was, uh, he's got some spiritual advisors, some woman who was, uh, telling people to send her money. There was a set, send her money for January. There was some, so some whole article about it, but it's basically essentially the same thing. It's like the idea is that, what is she saying? Donald spiritual advisor. Paula white suggest people send her there January salary or face consequences from God. Is that true? She's attractive too. It's interesting. Is that true? Yeah. Look at her. Pam. I'll give you money. What do I got to do? What am I going to do? Paula? How much do you need? I don't know if that's a good picture. Maybe she just looks good when she's screaming and she looks good. But um, yeah, I would love for some really, I would love for the day where there's some real powerful spiritual, uh, individual who doesn't ask for money.

Speaker 1:          00:24:20       You will that sound who doesn't, who? Real power. Powerful or spiritual individual. It's a huckster. I know. That's what I mean. Like, it would be so great if some like, so you listen to some people, like I watched, I was doing some Gig and there was this black preacher and he was out on stage and he's talking and it was like he's really entertaining and he's, and he had a couple of Nice things that he was saying and then please send me your money. And that is, looks like, imagine if a guy showed up. Well there is, there's plenty of those people on instagram who don't ask for doe. Yeah, they're not. They're just trying to be okay. Like Gary Vee for instance. Gary v's whole thing is about hustling. Gary v's like the anti secret. He's hand tie the secret in, in, in. You look at like what Gary Vee does.

Speaker 1:          00:25:02       Gary Vee is all about, I was sick for several days, so I was fighting some can all last week. Yeah, I got it. I got the flu, I got the flu. Uh, I thought it had it. Um, like I left here. Um, so I'll, I'll, I'll, I'm diverting, but let me, let me just get back to this Gary v thing. But what guys, I do want to talk colds, those book. So I don't know if he's the best example. He sells books, but he's not asking for money. I mean, he's actually, and he's actually a guy who was, he's experienced some success as an entrepreneur. And I listened to people, how do I say this without being mean? There's a lot of people that are giving advice online because people react well to it because they're, they're giving advice because when they give advice, people respond to it and they say, this is amazing.

Speaker 1:          00:25:54       And they'll, they'll blanket and they'll, they'll give them positive feedback and love, but their advice is at least a certain percent of it is just nonsense. They're just talking, right. They're just trying to say things they've heard before or they're trying to somehow or another put together a sentence that sounds like you'll get some likes. Yeah. You know what I mean? Yeah. There's a lot of guys, you just got to surround yourself with positive people to crystally. It makes fun of those people in a hilarious way. He's great. Or is it about Comedians who do it? Oh, just not just comedians who do it, but just people do it. But here's the thing. Sometimes people will say things that are real and are really inspirational. Yes, and that's great too. It's just knowing, knowing horseshit. Yes.

Speaker 2:          00:26:44       You got to know Horse Shit. Know a lot of people don't know where the Horse Shit is. This secret is horse shit. See that's the problem. Gary v is inspirational and motivational. I guarantee you there's a lot of people out there that have done things in their life that they might not have done because of Gary v because he's a hustler because he's really got a lot of energy and he's like, just fucking put down your phone. You know, go out there and get things done. Sleep an hour less sleep, a fucking hour left. And it'll just tell you like, do this, sell that, go. And it gives you practical advice about how to get started and get things done. It's like the opposite of the secret. Is this what seminars? I'm sure Gary does shows at that. It sounds like Tony Robbins, he just sort of, but he's more like, I mean Tony Robbins, he younger, more energetic hustler character crystal. He lives in the same play. This give you some volume.

Speaker 5:          00:27:36       Pardon? It says you could do anything you put your mind to accept. Most things is perseverance. He's got an ego to shut down the town, stopping, remaining focused, never quitting.

Speaker 2:          00:27:59       So funny. Meanwhile he does all those things as well. This is from his last special. Meanwhile it works really funny. The funny thing is Chris actually does work hard. I literally, well yeah, that's, that's the kind of, yeah. I mean Kevin Hart now has moved into that realm. He has so many people listen to them and all of a sudden they just, you know, he's, I love him. He's hilarious. He's a really good guy. I've known him for a long time, but now he's got so many followers and he has so many people listening that he's starting to do that. It's, he's not just telling jokes, he's doing crunches and telling you that you've got to believe in. And I said to my daughter, my daughter was like, is he a comedian? She asked if she was showing the thing. I said, yeah, he's really funny.

Speaker 2:          00:28:41       I saw that this is a different thing. I said, do you think I can make videos that just tell people to live better with David like that? No, Dad. Well, I'm guilty of that too. I've done that too, but if it's just, there's things that you know that you've experienced and that you've done, you want people to know about, but it's not everything I say. The problem with some people k all day, you're inspiring people. That's all you fucking do, right? All you do, right. All you do is give out advice. Yeah, that's it. What do you do? Do you just advice give no, there's it. There's a thing about, there's a thing about Kevin, there's a thing about you that you watched somebody, they're interesting. You like them and they're getting shit done and you're like, I'll take advice from this guy. I will. I'll, I'll hear what he has to say. There is that element. It's when it becomes bullshit. Bullshit. When it becomes, no, you have to listen to me because I have all the answers, right. And God talks to me and that kind of stuff. Well, there's songs that, there's love songs that you hear that hit you

Speaker 1:          00:29:42       and you go, wow. Like why is that? Why does that resonate so, so much? Why is it so profound? And then there's songs we were like, shut this stupid fucking nonsense down. Right? Yeah. It's like there's this pop musicy plastic hollow, empty bullshit that also has a lot of those same words in it, right? Like what is the difference? And that millions of people like, yeah, yeah, but they're dumb as fuck. Well that's, but it's the same thing. You've got all these people that is still buy into the Horse Shit. Yeah. There is a big herd of people out there that you can, if you just start doing, if Chris just stopping and convenient started posting videos like that all the time. Oh, he would kick out. Just get followers. Well, if he really wanted to, if deleah really wanted to be an inspirational guy, he's a handsome fella.

Speaker 1:          00:30:34       He's got a great voice. He's got a lot of energy. He's, he's, you know, he's dynamic. He could do that. It. Yep. He could do something like that if you want me to. Kevin, the same thing. The thing is though, Chris can do other things. A lot of these inspirational fucks, they really can't do things right. They're not doing anything right. They're not producing any great works. They're not, they're not doing any interesting art. They're not creating any interesting music. They're not making any funny comedy. What they're doing is just trying to like, you know, there's a lot of people out there that don't think they can do it, but you can. It's in you. It's a flower that must be watered with the love of the gods and like, yeah, oh, you can't, there's so many of them. They're overwhelming. They are, but so their business is not getting money from you necessarily.

Speaker 1:          00:31:24       Their business is in you paying attention to them and then as you pay attention to them and to their social media, their social media page grows and then they can do like speeches at these. Have you seen no self help conferences? Some people go on boats, they get, they go go on a cruise ship and the ship is just giving different kinds of advice. Yeah. Peaches and everyone get in here, we're going to have a session and see and he, you know, and it does help people, like there are people that they do help. Yes, true. Some of it works. I mean if you're, if you're lost and you're just, you don't know what's going on and you're been a loser for a while and you take a couple of his tips. Yeah. And you start working and writing shit down and go in and have some self confidence, it can help your life.

Speaker 1:          00:32:09       But there's some of these guys that all they're doing is just trying to like figure out a way to give people advice when they've never done shit themselves. Yeah. And that did not, it's not worth listening to, but yet they're there and they're there, but it's the way it, but is that any worse than an open miker right. Is it, I mean, if someone now, but I want to do is, I'm sorry if someone says, what I want to do is I want to become a motivational speaker. I want to really help people. I want to really touch people, but right now I kinda suck at it. It's like you don't, you don't just start out as Tony Robbins. No, that's right. Yeah. You're just starting and it's like a trainer. It's like a bright boxing trainers never really want to fight. It could just be like an old guy who's just some of those guys.

Speaker 1:          00:32:53       Most of them in fact a former fighters. But are they? Yeah. It's very rare that someone's a boxing tracking sales guy. What? Freddie Roach. Yeah. It was a good boxer. Yeah. He's a famous professional. Oh yeah. Yeah. He's got Parkinson's because of it. Oh really? Yeah. He's got trauma related Parkinson's disease from his time in the, in the ring Angelo Dundee. He fought, um, uh, shit. Uh, what the fuck's his day name? The Puerto Rican guy. Hagler Hector Camacho. Camacho. Yeah. He fought Camacho. He fought a lot like big name guys. Wow. He, he was a big deal. Like in terms of like journeymen fighters. Freddie, Freddie Roach was and his, his brother Pepper Roach is also a known guy in the world of boxing. Yeah. Freddie was legit legit guy. He was a legit pro. Are there trainers that just train people that they just became trainers and boxers? They definitely have some experience.

Speaker 1:          00:33:51       Usually they have some amateur fights or they, it's very, very rare that someone becomes, I respected boxing trainer without having any competition experience just doesn't seem to make any sense. Some of them, they realize early on that they're better at coaching than they are competing. Whether it's because of physical dynamics or whether it's uh, you know, they just don't like getting hit, you know, they know the limits or some people just are really good at teaching others. Yeah, that's a, that's a weird thing too. And the world of Jujitsu, it's very common because a, in Jujitsu there's a lot of people that get really good at understanding and um, like one of the guys, it's going to be here next week. John Danaher is world famous for it. Yeah. He's very famous for being like one of the greatest coaches in Jujitsu of all time, but as boy, as far as I know, very little experience in terms of actual competition.

Speaker 1:          00:34:46       Oh yeah. But he's as he's kosher. Yeah. Unparalleled. He's like universally regarded as one of the great coaches alive. That's impressive. Yeah. I got my 12 year old, a uh, a heavy bag Christmas. Yeah. You should, uh, just wrapping her hands. He's got gloves. Teach. Get someone to teach her how to do it correctly. Yeah. My Buddy Matt is coming over to, oh, he's a trainer. He worked on their Angelo Dundee for awhile and open his own gym. My good buddy Matt Bay Monte and he's going to come my teacher on Thursday. That's good. Yeah, it's pretty cool. It's a good way to get out aggression too. That's why he got it for, she would just get angry. She'd be doing schoolwork and be like, this is bullshit. And I'm like, and she's like, I want to be, I want to punch something. She started like punching pillows once in a while. So now we got her a bag. You're, what, how much of you is Italian? Um, all of it's Italian except

Speaker 2:          00:35:38       for my one grandfather was German. Angry people. The Germans or the talented 10th Bolt Sicilian Italian Sicilian is the dominant part is a little temporary. People are jeans. Yeah. Fucking feed knuckle sandwiches to people. Really tough. She's just like this beautiful 12 year old girl. Just wants to punch my sister's that way too. I stopped dating Italian girls when I was 21 last time. Girl I dated. He took a swing at me. I was like, that. I'm good. Did you? Yeah. Did you deserve it? Nope. But I saw it coming. I was like, I was like, this is, I can't believe this is happening. She's actually trying to punch me. She's going to punch where they just can make a bunch of me. Like I saw her shoulder pull back. I'm like, there's no way this is actually happening. Yeah. Yeah. No. It gets fighting at the time.

Speaker 2:          00:36:26       So I was used to people punching me. So as she's pulling her shoulder back and Mike, this camp, we were really happening. I don't believe this is happening. Oh my God, it's happening. It's not content. It's funny, but I think she just wanted attention. I don't think she actually, I think she's pretty sure that it wasn't going to land. You know that if she threw a punch at me that I was just going to, cause it's just really wanted to hurt me. She fucking hit me when I wasn't looking. You know? That's what people do. They don't just look right at you and you motherfucker. But then again, when people are in the height of some sort of fucking Sicilian love rage. Right, exactly. You don't want to mess with that screaming and the yelling and the throwing things around. That's also very east coast.

Speaker 2:          00:37:06       Oh yeah. I've talked about this ad Nauseum, but I really believe that that's the echoes of those fucking barbarians that came over on boats from Europe. Yeah. And didn't even know what America looked like. No. Did he knew to have a photo to look at and these fucking cave people pulled up on rafts and start a fucking, immediately they started baking bread, rolling up pasta bagging. Hey, I got bread for both of you. You brought up. Oh, you too. You have to lows. You're an animal, Tom. Papa God amongst man. There you go. This is for you. Do you, do you need, I've never given you the bread. I never give Jamie the brand. I'm like he's probably gonna appreciate it. How long will this stay? Good. Because Sunday's my cheat day. Sunday. Yeah, you'll be good. And where are we or should I just use days?

Speaker 2:          00:37:50       Pawn my cheat day or move it to today. If you keep it in paper, it'll wait. We'll have to toast it out to eat it today is the best way to eat it today or tomorrow? Actually tomorrow. Thursday. Better. Yeah. Why is it better? Cause it just came out. Ooh. So it's not good right away. It is. It's if you want that warm. It is, but really it's, it gets even better a day after, you know, that's the case with tuna. I did not know that. I always thought that if you bought Sushi, you're supposed to get fresh Sushi and just pulled it out of the wire. They're going to slice it up for you right now. But no. If you go to like a real master Sushi maker, that Sushi sits. Oh, really? Yeah. For how long? Fucking week. Sometimes. I know just the tutor.

Speaker 2:          00:38:34       I watched some documentary on some Sushi master. Oh, the hero? No, it wasn't that. It wasn't that guy, but that guy. That's a great one too. It's really good. I was like, somebody's, what we're talking about is a g row was that I tased him hero or zero euro. Jiro or a euro. How do you say it though? Do you know? But it's spelled with a j. Let's say Jiro. Jiro dreams of Sushi. I was like, I'm not going to watch a fucking documentary on a Chi. Makes Sushi fish a fish to the rice up. You're done, dude. Yeah. Okay. Give me some edamame. Miami would kick this. He started saying like some complicated casserole that you're putting together, you know? Yeah, but wow. You Watch it and go, oh, okay. I'm ignorant. This guy's an artist. Yeah. There's way more to this. Oh my God.

Speaker 2:          00:39:19       His whole soul is in it and it comes out. Yeah. Amazing. He's tiny ass little restaurant. That's about the size of this room. No interest in getting bigger. Nope, no franchising. Nope. Just doing this so well that people are going to, are going to come. There's something to that man. Oh, it's the best. I'm doing one thing really well. Like God, it's the best. There's something, there's definitely something to that. There's something to especially like the, the mindset of every day trying to learn how to make that egg dish perfect. That one egg dish that one guy said he'd worked on for a year. It's crazy. A fucking year. And the eggs, all that just completely doing it over and over and over. My bread thing is not I, it's probably like you're both thing, the bread thing. It's like you do just start to like focus on this one thing and trying to do it well and you just start to get, it becomes a part of you.

Speaker 2:          00:40:14       You're starting to put yourself into it. It's not just making bread, it's there. It is a practice. It is something that for a couple of years I've just kind of gone down that wormhole. Yeah, it's a good thing. The worm. Yeah. Doing that one thing I really, I feel like that sometimes with with standup it's like we've all these other things that are always going on and pulling us in different directions and stuff and it's like if you could just focus purely on just if that was the only, if you weren't taking any phone calls on anything else, you weren't podcasts and you weren't writing scripts, you weren't appearing on whatever, like would that make a difference? Like would you be yes and no because I think that we're, it requires a certain amount of dedication and a certain amount of time on stage, but I think it also requires certain amount of living. I think you need to do other things and although podcasting seems like a job and a distraction, one thing it is unquestionably is exploration. It's an exploration of ideas, right? At an unprecedented level. Like you're, you're exploring ideas without looking at your phone, without talk. You just, you and I are talking to three hours. When does that ever happen in life? Yeah. No it doesn't.

Speaker 1:          00:41:34       There's a lot of ideas that I come up with through stand up or in standup that came out of podcasts. Oh, sure. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Your mind's active. Yeah. So I think that that writing similar writings, oh yeah. Same kind of a thing. Yeah. But I also think doing stuff is important too. Not just the actual sit down talking part of your podcast, but actually going places, being active. You have to experience things. You have to watch documentaries. You have to go to a museum, you have to go see things. He got to go talk to people. You've got to go on adventures. Got To go travel. It's filling up the, well, yeah. This, you have to think of your brain almost like your crossfit, not crossfit. Uh, what's that? What's that word? Where you a cross training? I guess that's what I'm looking for when you're doing a bunch of different kinds of multitasking that will, no, no, no.

Speaker 1:          00:42:27       Different types of athletic, athletic activities that will enhance your sport if you play hockey, right. You don't just do hockey. You also are involved in the box jumps. You're doing a lot of, uh, you know, sprinting up hill, it's a good way to look at it. Yeah. These all these things enhance this one activity and it's not just all you have to do is just skate all day and you'll become the best skater while you may be, or you could get better at the motions of skating by strengthening your legs with weightlifting or doing this and you can accelerate your curve by doing yoga or you could, you know, I think that that there's something to that with comedy, at least for,

Speaker 4:          00:43:06       yeah, no, I agree. I mean, when I'm really actively writing other stuff, whether it's scripts or whatever, uh, my writing for standup improves does. Yeah. Yeah. And reading, by the way, reading, writing stuff, it all feeds the act. When you, when you then shift your focus over here, back to the act, you're better because of that stuff. But I do sometimes think like the Sushi guy, like, but what if the output was only geared towards that? The input I get doing all that stuff. But would there be a difference?

Speaker 1:          00:43:43       Maybe. I mean, maybe there's something to that. I mean, I don't know. I don't know anybody who does that way though.

Speaker 4:          00:43:50       Well, maybe at him.

Speaker 1:          00:43:53       Yeah. But Regan plays golf and drinks and does a lot of other shit, but he's not creating other art. He's not writing scripts. He's not, he also doesn't. Right, right, right. He writes like cutting his head and then it goes on stage and works on stuff. Right? Yeah. Yeah. Which I'm torn on. I mean, I know it's, it's a very effective, some people do it amazingly well and that's how they've created incredible works of art. But I never give that advice. Whenever anyone asks me, I say, you should do both. You should write down things and you should write on a computer. You should. Right. Or however you like to write, but you should also fuck around on stage. You should do both. Yeah. That's what I think.

Speaker 4:          00:44:33       Yeah. No, I do too. I can't just show up on stage and hope it's going to happen.

Speaker 1:          00:44:38       Well, here's some ideas that I've had that I'll like literally like have in my car and then I'll bounce them around by myself a little bit and not having ever written them down. I'll go onstage and then it'll just catch fire and it will become a bit, and there's some bits that have made it to specials that I've never even written down. I just knew how to do them because I did them a bunch of times. And most of them, not though, most of them not,

Speaker 4:          00:45:04       or at least I always feel like I'll bring an idea up on stage that hasn't been written down yet. There's something there, there's something going on, but then I bring it back to the shop and we'll play with it. And then, then it becomes this back and forth. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:45:22       Like, here's what one example, this is a bit that I, I bounced around, I was thinking about in the car and then I brought it onto stage in a completed form and it never really changed. It's a bit about, uh, big foot. I said, here's what you don't find. When you go looking for bigfoot black people, like you're more likely to find big foot. Then you are black people looking for bigfoot and just fine hordes of unfuckable white dudes out camping. That's what she fine. That's, that's how it goes. Looking for bigfoot. You're not, you don't find it's not African American pastime and that that bit came out in the car. I made myself laugh and then it never changed. It just became that. I don't think I ever wrote it down anywhere. Hated it into my 2014 comedy central special. That's a little, but that's rare. Those are the rare ones. It is rare, but man, it'd be nice if they were all came that way. Yeah. It's been a few. They're usually, for some reason they're one liners to like that. He's so funny. It's just complete. Yeah. Some of them are just, they just formed themselves complete.

Speaker 4:          00:46:37       It's just a bowser best too. When you makes you laugh. Yeah, like there's things that you've just thinking your head. Yeah. That's pretty funny. There's a funny thing and then you bring it up on stage and it becomes really funny, but when it really just truly makes you laugh, then you, it's such a, that's great. Yeah, it is great. When there's

Speaker 1:          00:46:55       thing that he just clicks to the point where you just start giggling, get the fuck out of here. Yeah. Those are my favorite kind of jokes

Speaker 4:          00:47:04       keep. Yeah, because it's, that's what, that's why you started making people laugh as a kid in the first place was just having fun. And sometimes as an adult you've got all this other stuff in your head. It's like you do have to kind of remind yourself, this is fun. This is silly shit. They should be giggle enjoyable, you know? Yeah. It should be. Yeah, it should be. Sometimes it can be, feel like, you know, because it out of writing, the other stuff that does come out of writing, writing can be a grind. Writing is insular. It's by yourself. You're just in there alone doing, it's not this joyful place. Most of the time you're not, you're not writing like, but it's not painful. So painful. But it's, but it is a practice that is different than just being with your buddies. Talking about big foot.

Speaker 1:          00:47:50       Yes. Yeah. No. Yeah, that's, those are the fun ones, right? The big foot ones are the ones that come out of nowhere with no effort and they kill and like, I got this for free. It's like got some crazy scape or the not worried about damaging cars and work on it for a hundred years. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:48:07       No writing's not painful, but there is a thing, there is a mental part where you, if you're, if you're ever like put it down for a while and don't do it, it's like you gotta get your head back into the space of doing it. That could be a little painful. It's that hard. I don't know.

Speaker 1:          00:48:23       It is, but I don't know if you ever read, um, Steven Pressfield's book the war of art. No, it's excellent. It's so good that I bought stacks of it and I used to hand it out to people on the podcast. Oh really? Yeah. Because I think most people like when you say it, like if someone says like what's the difference between guys who get things done and guys who go don't get things done. Yeah, this sounds so stupid simple. But the people that get things done do things. You actually do it. They sit down and do it and there's something about the people that don't get things done that stops them from doing that. Like what is it? And pressfield calls it resistance. And what he says is that you have to, you have to overcome resistance because that's where professionals do you sit down because you, you have affirmed that you are a pro and you sit down and you go over what you are going to do.

Speaker 1:          00:49:16       This is what I do. I A professional I've, right, right. And I'm going to sit down and I'm going to write and I'm going to summon the Muse and the Muse, any, whether the muse is a real thing or not and he treats it as it's as it's a real thing. And the concept is that you are going to summon this thing that you call upon to endow you with creativity and that doing the work by doing the work. Yeah. And then that overcoming this resistance is the war of art and um, yeah, that's what is the resistance then? That's the question. It's my negative thoughts really. What's, it's not just negative thoughts. It's resisting work. It's, it's not negative in this. It's like, it's weird. You're like, something's po stopping you from succeeding. Something stopping you from, from pushing forward and putting down those ideas

Speaker 4:          00:50:07       you want the easy, you want to just sit on the couch. Like in my office, I have a couch and I have a desk and the couch, I said, you know, nothing gets done. Nothing gets done on the couch. Really. It's, it's, it's about sitting there. There was this great a quote from this Israeli writer who I, every time I'd say the quote I say, I always forget what his name was and I should know it because he used the quotes so often, but he says that writing and the job of being a writer is the same as being a shopkeeper and it's your job to go and open the shop every day and some days nothing happens. Some day you're just sitting in the shop like an idiot behind the desk and nobody's there and then some days the shop is buzzing with action and activity and people in and out and stuff is happening. But all of those days when it's really busy and active does not happen unless you opened the shop every day. It's such an easy way for my brain to kind of think of it. That's a brilliant way of putting it. Just go and sit down at the place where you do the work and start doing the work. He may not be great. That's not up to you. If it's going to be great, it's up to you whether or not you sit down and start working. Have you ever,

Speaker 1:          00:51:21       I read Stephen King's on writing. Yeah, that's great. That was a good one. Those are my two go to books when I'm feeling like I need something to recharge.

Speaker 4:          00:51:30       Jan would be a good one to go back to. And you know, I read that one like a long time ago and uh, his just thing of you just like what you're saying, you just have to do it. You just have to do, right.

Speaker 1:          00:51:42       Yeah. I mean there's, there's days that I'll go and I'll write for fucking hours and literally get nothing out of it. There's nothing there. Nothing, nothing. It's all bullshit and then nothing. And if you judge yourself by that, you'd go like, Hey, I'm a fucking terrible writer. Yeah. Stink. And then one day you'll just sit down and then you have your next 10 minutes. You're like, oh boy, there's something here. I got here, I got something here. I got it. Sparks. Yeah, because you showed up. Speaking of sparks. Did you hear about this fucking bird that they found that starts fires? No. They found a hawk that picks up burning embers and sticks that are on fire and s flies them across rivers and creeks to start the fires on the other side so that it could force a game animals to run away. Wow. Brilliant. Took of this. Birds of prey are starting fires, deliberately kites and foulk. I didn't know kite was a bird. Kites and Falcons are intentionally dropping smoldering twigs to smoke out mice and insects in Australia. Jesus Christ. Geez. Louise. Researchers of compile the study of reports of wild bird spreading fires. They believe the birds carry these burning twigs to unburnt parts of the Bush and the birds dropped them in a bid to smoke out, pray, blah, blah, blah.

Speaker 4:          00:53:06       They also smoke three packs a day.

Speaker 1:          00:53:08       What does it say? The researchers said birds. Could you see the third force capable of starting bushfires? That's incredible. There's, it's clever. Yeah, there's so, there's so irresponsible. He's fuck, I don't give a shit about fires and they fly away like, wow, fly where fire isn't. I got a mouse. All neighborhoods burnt down, but he got a mouse snacks, cheese, Douche bags. Did you see that chicken that the researchers created that accidentally somehow or another through when they put it together, um, had the face of a dinosaur. Have you seen this? No. Yeah, we'll see if you can find that on my, it's on my twitter, but they made, they made chicken. Don't know what the fuck they did. Read it. I briefly read the article. I'm like these motherfuckers and then I ran away but he got scared. He had to face is chicken as the face of the fucking dinosaur.

Speaker 1:          00:54:04       Get teeth. It's a chicken with the dinosaurs face. So who got the dinosaur stuff? Pull it up. Who got the dinosaur DNA and put it in that oh no gross face of a dinosaur. What? What's earth dude? I've been telling people forever because of the fact that I keep chickens now. Chickens are fucking monsters. They are monsters. They give good eggs though they do have good eggs. But we have this idea of them as being these cute little cuddly little fluffy things that lay eggs. And just peck around now they're fucking monsters. Doesn't even pull up the, uh, the, the, the top of the article. Jamie go to the top of and make it larger so I could read it there. So, so what it says, blah, blah, blah. Group of dinosaurs. The idea, I keep going, uh, to understand how one change the other team has been tampering with the molecular process, um, that make up a beacon chickens.

Speaker 1:          00:55:01       By doing so, they've managed to create a chicken embryo with a dinosaur likes snout and a palette similar to that of feathered dinosaurs like Velossa raptor. They're making raptors. The results are published in the journal evolution. The team's aim was to understand how the bird beak evolved because the beak is such a vital part of birds and bird anatomy. It's been crucial for their success to 10,000 or more. More species occupy a wide range of habitats and many have specialized beaks to help them survive. So it mess the mess with them. The neck, molecular makeup of the beak. Yeah. And he made a fucking dinosaur phase chicken. How long? I'll be good when they're running around. That will be great when they're at the petting zoo. I bet they would have better. I bet they would have better eggs because like my chicken's eggs are significantly better when I let them loose and they go fuck up. Like my, like they'll eat mice and they'll eat worms, bugs, bugs and then I'll get these dark yolks. Like the last couple of days they've been running around my yard all day. So really? Yeah. So the exit I'll collect tonight or tomorrow will be dark orange, but when they're sedentary, they're lazy. They're just in the cage. Um, well they have it. They have a very large coupe. The coupe is right. The coop is essentially for the 19 chicken, seven 17 now a of them died. 17

Speaker 2:          00:56:24       chickens I have, it's basically the size of this room. So they all good space. They got plenty of room to wander around and plenty of food. But they like when you ever see vegetarian raise chicken and vegetables that they don't want that. Oh no, that's just that. They'll eat that if that's all you give them. But they won't eat, they won't eat things like bugs. And worms. That's most of it. But mice more than anything. Mice, they found a mouse. They fight for it. It's one of the few things that they will fight for real? Yeah. One, we'll grab the mouse and they will just chase each other and try to fuck that mouse up. How are those eggs? Amazing. It's hard to tell like who's laying the eggs. What do you do with all the exit eggs? This is a lot of them out to people.

Speaker 2:          00:57:09       You can have some new ones in bags. Yeah, sure. I'll take some, excuse me, some eggs. I got to meet for you to come out of elk. I got songs I really started to crave to this year. Oh yeah, I know. Alright. Eh, that's a good serve it up. Could he for the meet? Me and my, my dog are so happy with the hell comes out. Yeah, I showed you a picture. Did they send you a shot of Mike? You cooking? I was cooking up the ground alk and the dog is just like, we're doing this right? Yeah. Grass fed butter and ground elk, garlic salt. It's really good. With the eggs to and mix it up and eggs. That's exactly what I do. Remember. We put it on a little bit of the sour dough bread. Now you're thinking, damn, take the sourdough. You put a lot of butter on it. Just use it as the base and put that on top of it and then just cut it and eat it. We need a friend with a vineyard. Ooh, we had a friend who makes his own wine. Yeah, it would be great. We live in the right state for it. Oh, I know. I know a guy who does it. You do? Ah, I don't know.

Speaker 2:          00:58:17       I never had his wine. He gave me a bottle. What the fuck happened to it? Oh yeah. Yeah. It's a buddy of mine I can drink and he's in the real estate business. I drank a lot of wines. Second half of the year. Yeah, a lot. Too much. I started reading fashion time. No, but I'm not drinking for January. The whole month off sober January. My friend was, my friend was like, I'm just going to, uh, I'm not, we went out on the second and he's like, no, I'm not. I'm not drinking for the month of January. And I was like, that sounds good. I'm going to do that to not thinking. And uh, it's been a week and I'm like, this is stupid. Which makes me think maybe it's not a bad thing. I've never taken a whole month off since I started drinking as a kid. You got to do sober October. That's the move sober October.

Speaker 2:          00:59:06       Yeah. We all do it. Yeah. Yeah. I dunno if everybody's going to do it this year. I doubt we're going to get burke do it again. Bert was in a part do with that frothy panic. What time November rolled around. I was holy Shit. Look in his face. You know where he was. Um, he was getting his, uh, his jollies he was going on instagram feeds of people that were clearly losing their fucking mind. Like, oh no, you'd send them to me like comedians or other fucking minds. He'd send them like a Cha, just just check out her instagram story. I'm like, you son of a bitch. And I go there. I'm like, oh my God, what have you done? Oh, not when I'm not drinking. Just crazy. Just being crazy. It's been crazy. There are some people out there and I know I don't want to out them, so I'll tell you off the air, there are some people you find out about their instagram story and you go, oh, there's a hidden little gem here online.

Speaker 2:          00:59:58       Instagram is such a great tell for people. I was going to work with this guy and I was like, I asked my other friend, they said, do you know him? Like, is he, this is just a, he's a director, was like, do you know this game? And uh, he's like, well, I don't want to say anything. I'm like, what? She, she's just look at his instagram. I was like, oh, what a, what an old man thing that I didn't think to do that. So just go on the instagram. You're like, oh, there were train wreck, train wreck. Just seeing them posting all their insanity inspirational stuff. Now this was just pure bad chick teaching you partying. You know how to be the fully actualized person. I don't mean Shit. I'm Kevin, by the way. I mean Kevin is he, he's one of those guys that get shit done.

Speaker 2:          01:00:44       Like he's Kevin, Kevin Hart when I was saying like Kevin Hart's thing. No, he's, he legitimately get things done and also legitimately gets a thrill out of helping people get motivated. Exactly. He does runs where he brings hundreds of people out running with them and say you do like a five k and everybody yacht show up. I know. And everybody will run with Kevin Hart. He's legit. Hey, how far do you run when you run with your dog? No more than, well, Marshall doesn't like to, he gets to the point of the end of the run. He's only a year old, like two miles is about. Yes, we're, we're, you know, push a pretty good pace in the hill and the hill. Very steep hills at two and I don't bring any water for him. Oh No, no. So at two miles, that's all I want to push them because at the end his fucking tongue is bright red and he's like two miles up hills is, that's a lot.

Speaker 2:          01:01:36       It's great. He's great for the rest of the day. Yeah. The rest of the day he's like, hey man, chill best. He's such a good dog. Bad. I love golden retrievers. They're so good. Yeah, they are great dogs. They're so food oriented though. Sometimes to the point of being annoying, so it was my lab. Yeah. Labs are two, same thing. Just a lot of dogs are like that. Yeah. If they're active, they're hungry. Yeah. Metabolism is quick and they want to eat to make just yet. The good news is they're really easy to train with food because they love food so much. Just give them like little treats and he's this dog that I, that I have Marshall, he's the best I've ever had as far as like listening to sit and stay and lie down

Speaker 1:          01:02:19       and stuff like that. And when I go running with him, I don't worry about him. He stays close to me. That's cool. He runs and then I'll like, he'll, he's ahead of me and I go, hey man, slow down. And they'll just stop and wait for me and then I'll come up to them. Then it'll start running again. It's great. I've never, I've never, uh, taken her off leash like that and I feel like it'd be a blast. The only thing I worry about is rattlesnakes. Yeah. That's, that's an issue because I don't think he knows exactly what a rattlesnake is. I bet the instinct would kick in if he didn't get surprised by it. There were the war instincts. I'm worried about it. The wrong ones, which are to get clothes. Oh, you think and get bit, it's think they'd be like all in ancient Dna of hearing that rattle.

Speaker 1:          01:02:59       Like Ah, three dogs that were bit by rattlesnakes. Oh really? Yeah, because they went after it. Yeah. One, one of them got bit, I brought him to the doctor and I'm like, I think he got bit by a rattlesnake and the veterinarians like, Oh, you gonna play me as I'm going to play the sad song. And the veterinary, they're fine. He lived the, but the veterinarian was like, um, everything seems okay. Am I, I don't know man. I'm pretty sure the snake got him and he goes, well, you know, if, uh, if he's acting funny later, let me know. So I bring them home. Our laters face swells up like a fucking basketball. It just took a while for it to kick in. I thought I was doing the right thing by getting him to the vet in time. I'm like, I'm gonna just get them there right away.

Speaker 1:          01:03:44       I'm in the car, you know, I just beat the clock. Yeah. Yeah. And it took a while for the venom to like sink into his house. It took over an hour because I was at the mention hour. Yeah. Yeah. Because I was at the veterinarian's office, um, within, he got bit, I had them there within 35, 40 minutes. And then the vet, the vet's looking at items like, I don't see any marks. I don't see any blood. There's no like clear, uh, he might have gotten missed or the, the thing might not have gotten even a minimum, maybe got lucky. So I take him home, his face just like boom, it happens. Their face swells up. Oh, it's brutal. Yeah. And then it costs thousands of dollars. It's very expensive. The antivenom, they use the antivenom. It's really expensive just to inject that. It's thousands of dollars. Yeah. Which is really bad for people that are poor, you know, if you don't have any money to pay for that and your dog, it's bit, it's a fucking tremendous stress.

Speaker 1:          01:04:42       Oh Man. Yeah. Would they survive? I mean, if it's, that dose was five. Yeah. If some dogs, dogs don't. Yeah. But some dogs die from it for sure. Uh, it's, it's really bad for them. I don't have a place to run my dog like that. We've got like all streets around this, so it's like, hey, you got to drive them somewhere, man. Take him to a Runyon Canyon or something. Can you take him off leash in those places? It's not. The problem is you never know what kind of dogs are going to run into, or coyotes or angry moms. Yeah, that's true too. Yeah. It was a lot of people like that. Yeah. Yeah. If you

Speaker 2:          01:05:17       can go places that are less populated, those are the best for off-leash type activities. She would be so happy, but she's a lab too sweet dogs and wants to run and they're not, they're not like the kind of dogs. It's not like you're taking a press Kenario hundred and 20 pounds. Yeah. Demon dog. No, but nothing loose because she's sweet. Yeah. Demon dog. What was the name of that dog? Presta Kenario. He never seen my mouse there tanks. They're these huge fucking muscular canary. I'm looking, there's a, a guy who was breeding some that I know is making these Brenda ones. They look so crazy. They're like the ultimate guard dog. Little dinosaur being the size of the thing. Oh, it's like a mastiff. Yeah. Super aggressive. Oh really? Yeah. Oh, quick on that black one above it. That will be that gray top [inaudible] shoulders. He's going to fuck you with that big Dick.

Speaker 2:          01:06:14       God, giant Horse Dickies. Got His doggy legs. Oh my God. Are these are, these are round. Yeah, man. They're, they're real. They're not dinosaurs. They have these like people have these. Oh yeah, yeah. I know. Some people have. Um, my friend mark has two of them. Yeah, that is scary. So enormous dark there. Apparently very good loyal watchdog. So they are, they're nice to have a family. Well, it's all in. Who breeds them? Look at the one where the dogs on a leash. Polen are there like a fucking, she's filled on that thing. Blow. What a nightmare. If that was chasing after you, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck. What are you doing? A dog comes at you and it's going to wants to bite you. Just punch it and give him your arm. Just giving me your arm. No. A dog's going to attack you if you know for sure. If you have the time you feed him, your arm stabbed the shit out of him while he's grabbing your arm. You then nick. Oh yeah. Well, if you don't have a weapon, you're fucked. So why don't you carry a weapon? Should have a weapon. Always. I should always have a weapon. Yes. You never know when you get to attack. No weapon.

Speaker 2:          01:07:23       Oh really?

Speaker 2:          01:07:26       Hi. Hey. I see. I told you, you carry out a show tack by a Goddamn Dog. It's a dog knife. Never know. Nice coyotes. Mountain lions. I was, what do you do when you, when you, why he got put it in your bag, your teeth like a pirate. Damn. Check. Tsa Pre. No, I don't bring it with me when I travel. I just opening boxes today. I'm only kidding. Oh, you don't carry that all the time, asshole. I had open boxes. A lot of people do. Don't you think there's a lot of people out there and next to you at the seven 11 that have, uh, and yeah, they're carrying shit. Oh yeah. I know a guy who used to carry a gun on his ankle. He might still do it, I don't want to say his name, but he was the guy he used to fight for the UFC.

Speaker 2:          01:08:14       He a gun on him and he's huge. He's a giant man. Right? He carried a gun on his ankle. He carried one in the small of his back. He carried a knife in his front pocket on both sides. He had two knives that he carried all the time and he carried his shoulder holster just to go to the store. Everywhere he went. Everywhere he went, he was a locked and loaded like he was the wrong guy to fuck with in every single possible way. 260 pounds and enormous trained black belt. She FC champion loaded to the hilt carrying knives and guns all over his persona. Like the cool part about that, which I always like in the movies is when you're done with your day and you're just unloading all that stuff on your dresser, you know when your client take, have a strap on thing or that thing.

Speaker 2:          01:09:06       That always seems, I love that part of being a man of just having all the stuff you got to unload to them. Go to like beyond keys and y hippie like gun machete, others guns. Right. Exactly. Cause anybody to carry brass knuckles anymore. Those out. They must've made me. Yeah, why not? Yeah. It's not a thing anymore. Not like, I wonder if those are legal. That was something you'd hear about when we were kids. Oh, they got brass knuckles cause bugs bunny had him. That's the only place we were hearing stuff with children. You don't hear about brass knuckles at all and the yeah. Now words are what? Hurt. Get Your Aa, get you some brass knuckles shape or her with words. Words are violence. Give me some brass knuckles machine. Yeah, the old day Shane. Yeah, the old day. Shane. Why did they talk like that back then?

Speaker 2:          01:09:59       Train. Cause that's the way he spoke back then. Shea, you had that coffee just sitting there for longest time. It's still hot in port. No, I had a bunch. You had a little bit of it. Yeah. I love coffee. You do addicted Brennan Shab told me that he drinks 12 cups of coffee a day and that he's been throwing up a lot lately. And it's because of the coffee because all the acid in the stomach. Yeah. Just coffee. Give you acid. Is that what it does? Yeah, it's acidic. Yeah, putting the beans, all that jazz. And that fucks with your stomach. Yeah. If you're drinking, how many? 1212 yeah. It was drinking 12 cups of coffee a day. Yeah, that's an addiction. Music for him, for his stomach. I said that's a big time. Addiction. Cops

Speaker 6:          01:10:47       can make coffee is highly acidic and it can stimulate the hyper section. Secretion of gastric acid.

Speaker 2:          01:10:59       Caffeinated coffee has been shown to increase the city acidity to a greater degree than either regular coffee or caffeine alone. So decaffeinated coffee is more acidic than anything, which is caffeine and coffee. Stimulate

Speaker 1:          01:11:14       gastric acid secretion and decaffeinated coffee raises serum gastrin levels. That's disgusting. That back to your wine guy. Um, let's see. Oh, it's fine. The guy that's hook up with a guy, I do know one guy, maynard Maynard, maynard Keenan from tool. He's a friend of mine. He's actually, he has a vineyard, like a real vineyard in Arizona. That's right. It's not in calc. He makes great one. Oh yeah. Oh my God. Yeah. Well he's an artist. He's a weird motherfucker. Super, super smart guy and makes wine the same way. He makes music. Like he, they made it tool album and one of the songs was, was they, they wrote a song to the FIBONACCI sequence. What did, what did you just pull up the vineyard? I do see us. Dot. Yeah. Um, he wrote a song to the FIBONACCI sequence had been not cheesy. A fibonacci sequence is a mathematical sequence.

Speaker 1:          01:12:15       The way it works is like it goes like zero and the next number is one. Um, and the next time was two and then two plus one which is three. And then uh, then it keeps going like in this, in this mathematical progression. And that's how they had the chord progression. Had the chord progression link up to the FIBONACCI sequence. Just for fun. It's just a fucking maniac. But that same sort of attention to detail and obsessing the, you know the intricacies of things. He's an applied that to his wine. Amazing. It's really good. What's the label? A do ceus vineyards could do see us. Yeah. Yeah. He has an Austin Maria too. He has a small restaurant. Yeah. Jeez that's crazy. That sounds good. Yeah I think it gave me the food that fuck oh really guy. Oh that's where the flu k till he told me just got over the flu.

Speaker 1:          01:13:07       I'm like Oh shit head. Cause I was hanging out with him in Vegas and I think that's right when I started to catch it and then I had like a little bit of a cough and then it got a little worse and then I really did myself in, in the sauna. I crank the sauna up the 210 degrees. Oh relations. Uh, apparently too high for people. How, how high you supposed to go? One 76 to one nineties apparently people like anyway to 20, I went to, I was at two 10 for about an hour. Not an hour. But how long do you stay in there to 10 for? I was in to 10 for at least 20 minutes. 1515 minutes. You know what? I don't know how long I did it at two 10. How long has that most of the day? A bunch of times. Um, to get the right benefits, you're supposed to 20 minutes at 176 degrees.

Speaker 1:          01:13:59       It at least twice a week is like what they recommend. But sometimes you can get to four times a week. You're a lot better. Off, what's the main thing it does for you? It increases a bunch of things. First of all, does something called, it makes your body produce something called heat shock proteins, which are the, which radically reduce inflammation. It's similar in a lot of ways to cold shock proteins that you would get from a cryogenic chamber treatments. Uh, but can I ask a question, which we showed them question, but uh, why is inflammation, why is anti-inflammatory? Why, why is it bad to be inflamed? Well, I mean, I know it sounds kind of that's the root of almost all diseases. It is big, big, big cause of a lot. Well that was one of the things about this study. I think it was a Norwegian study on the song and they showed a decrease in mortality, a 40% decrease in mortality, uh, amongst all causes from people that use the sauna, I think three times or four times a week.

Speaker 1:          01:15:03       What? Yeah. Meaning 40% decrease in stroke, heart attack, all these different various factors. And they think that that's attributed to the heat shock proteins. Doctor Rhonda, Patrick Healy. Yeah. She's the one who got me into it. She's a frequent guest and the podcasts and super genius and a San Francisco. Yeah. Oh, that's cool. Yeah. That's nice. The coolest. She's very cool. She, we were just talking about, she was on the Kardashians. Oh really? Yeah. Jamie was telling me, which you're talking about the Kardashians. That doesn't make sense to them. How not to be inflamed. That's great. Your lips are inflamed. Are you sure you're not eating anything weird? No aggressor and what's going on with your butt? Your Butt is inflamed. It are you. Are you guys not getting in the Sauna? If Kim Carney ash and gotten the sauna, she probably starts sweating like, you know, like when you bake something, like if you have like a slow cook pork roast or something like that and you see all juicy of juice come pop in, all the top of it, it's putting a tray under to catch the drippings.

Speaker 1:          01:16:07       Yeah. Because you think about all squeezing all that fat that they pull out of the sides and then suck in and they pumped that stuff in the butt to make the but extra big. And then you put that button, the oven and that'll just get juicy. Goody, goody and Z. I'll tell you what that is some good eating is right. Yeah. Boil it down. So the heat, the heat proteins, heat shock proteins. Yeah. A cyto keens help you with inflammation. Yes. Yes. It helps your body fight off inflammation and so it doesn't in a natural way, instead of like nonsteroidal anti inflammatories like Ibuprofen, things along those lines, which are really bad for your gut health. Really bad for you. Like they say that Ibuprofen should be taken rare. Rarely if ever. Really. Yeah. It's apparently terrible for your body. Can cause strokes and it also is really bad for your, your gut flora.

Speaker 1:          01:17:04       I had a buddy, my friend Cameron Hanes is a ultra marathon runner. He runs, he's crazy. 200 plus miles and he's nutty fucking things taking Ibuprofen on a daily basis. And um, got off of it after he listened to the Rhonda Patrick podcasts and all of his joint pain went away and his joint pain was literally being caused. He thought it was being caused by all is running. It was being caused by his taking of the nonsteroidal antiinflammatories which increased his body's inflammation levels. Yes. Which is crazy because it damages your gut bacteria because it's fucking poison. He's taking 800 milligrams this shit every day. She body freaks out. I was telling him like, dude, you're significantly increasing your risk for stroke. And I sent him all these studies and findings on Ibuprofen. So he stops, he gets off of it. All of his joint pain goes away.

Speaker 1:          01:18:00       No, literally causing joint pain. So how has your gut connected to inflammation? Inflammation, which is one of the reasons why people tell you not to eat bread. It's why people tell you not to eat sugar. Refined carbohydrates cause inflammation. And one of the ways that cause it through the gut leakage and what we say inflamed. What is inflamed? That's a good point. Let's pull that up in a way that a car describe it. What is that? Inflammation. What is inflammation? Sorry. If you're going over style from the need to know about inflammation, inflammation is a defense mechanism in the body. The immune system recognizes damage cells. Oh, these fucking cops with the pop up on the immune system recognizes damage cells, irritants and pathogens. And it begins the healing process. When something harmful or irritating effects, part of your body is a biological response to try to remove it.

Speaker 1:          01:18:56       The signs and symptoms of inflammation can be uncomfortable, but or to show that the body is trying to heal itself. So if you're in a constant state of inflammation because you're constantly taking in foods that your body is reacting to in a very adverse way, that is what causes a lot of diseases on peep in people. And it also causes your body to your feeding certain aspects of gut bacteria, you know, that are just, it's you're just not healthy. And so you're putting, so the body is actually the same way they would fight a disease, is fighting these foods that come in exactly these medicines or whatever. Yes. Foreign things. Exactly. A big thing with food's a big thing with alcohol. You see people with puffy faces, they get it like permanently pumped up and they're all soft, fucking inflamed, everything's inflamed. Gut sticks out, their guts inflamed. And is it yourselves? Is it your arteries and everything? Everything is just pull up the rest of the things. Just kind of go back to that often the fluid. Um, yeah. Okay. Chronic inflammation can eventually cause severe t several diseases and conditions, including some cancers and rheumatoid arthritis, infections, wounds in any kind of tissue, uh, would not be able to heal itself without an inflammatory response. So inflammation is a part of the body's immune system. So what you're doing is you're, you're in a constant state of damage when you're eating shitty food. So if you're constantly eating sugar and drinking sodas and fucking corn syrup, all that bullshit. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:20:31       You're putting these weird chemicals in your body and your body's freaking out. So,

Speaker 1:          01:20:36       yeah, this is, they're not just making a distinction between, um, inflammation that comes from like a bruising or injury where your body's trying to heal itself versus something that's happening internally, right from, from your consumption of shitty foods. But there's this whole crazy many inflammatory causing foods that people eat on a daily basis. And we just think of it as food, Pizza, pizza's delicious, right. Fucking full of inflammation causing bullshit.

Speaker 3:          01:21:04       Why? It's uh, well, um, first of cheeses, the bread, the bread's,

Speaker 1:          01:21:10       which is unfortunately what you make, but I think that your bread is sour dough bread, which is different because sour dough bread apparently has less complex gluten's in it because, right, right.

Speaker 3:          01:21:22       Yeah. I have friends, I have friends that, uh, that, uh, have gluten issues that can eat my bread, not a to access, but it doesn't bother them the way they were processed bread about Islam. There's something about sour dough bread that ha, it's different. No. Commercial Yeast, the gluten structure is a little, a little, a weaker. Yeah. Well,

Speaker 1:          01:21:44       there's a great documentary that I watched recently called what's with wheat and it was all about how they changed wheat, um, to make higher yield, uh, wi which w you could grow more wheat and a shorter area and have a higher yield and that the, the gluten's in that wheat are much more, they're much more dense and complex then the natural wheat that we used to eat and 150 plus years ago. Right.

Speaker 3:          01:22:10       This bread that you're going to eat, it comes from this great, um, mill in a Utah that is pure organic small crops. So you won't have a problem with this. So it's like heirloom wheat, is that what they call it? I don't even know. That was a thing until maynard. Yes. Who told me about that is they use heirloom wheat in his pasta and he makes it as lost around. Interesting. It's easier for people to Digest. Yeah. It's, you know, it's a little more expensive and a little harder to get, but it's a, it makes a difference in the flavor is so much better. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:22:44       Bye. And Pasta when I rarely eat pasta, but I do eat it. I buy it from Italy and they have heirloom pasta in Italy and just you don't feel as fucking gross after you eat it.

Speaker 3:          01:22:55       Yeah. It's not like that brick that, yeah, that punch in the gut that just fucking like you ate a bag of rocks. So what is the, so the sauna, if you're eating all this stuff probably help and

Speaker 1:          01:23:06       you're putting in there and you're the, it would help, but you're also dealing with your gut biome, right? You're, you're, you're forcing your body to your eating foods that are going to encourage the growth of certain types of gut bacteria. Right. That live off of sugars and live off of,

Speaker 4:          01:23:26       a friend of mine got the gastro surgery, Yo and uh, she was diabetic and she had the gastro thing done and her diabetes leveled out and she said it was, the doctor says because of the bacteria, because the something that they did and taking something out. Does this make sense at all?

Speaker 1:          01:23:48       Yeah. Well, she probably had a terrible diet. Yeah, probably. Which is also probably one of the reasons why she was so big. Right. And you know that there's different kinds of bacteria. There's different types of diabetes, right? There's diabetes that has caused entirely by diet and this diabetes that is genetic and the type of diabetes that is caused by diet is reversible. It happens with a lot of people that wind up going on, you know, calorie restricted diets. Right. Reduce the amount of sugar they take in. And a Dean del Rey, Dean del Ray was a diabetic.

Speaker 1:          01:24:22       Yeah, he went to a doctor and the doctor he was, he had a real candy problem. He's eating candy constantly. Oh really? Yeah. It was hooked on sugar. Yeah. He talked to him now he's like sure is the fucking devil, man. Yeah, he dropped, he dropped a lot of weight. He dropped a lot of weight and got really fit. Yeah. He looks great. The Gym all the time now really high. It looks very healthy. Like Dean's never looked better now man, I don't eat that. Yeah, he's like sugars, the fucking devil, man. He's not wrong. No, he's not wrong at all. I mean is great. Every now and then it's like a lot of things, a little treat, you know, Tiramisu after a nice meal. That's what it used to look like. Wow. Yeah. Look, he looks inflamed. That face looks inflamed. That thing right there, it says, people ask me, how do I do it?

Speaker 1:          01:25:11       How do you not get tempted to eat sugar? I keep photos like this around the house to constantly remind me, never again. Fat Dean. Fuck. Sugar healthy. See that's inspiration right there. Yeah, yeah. Well, yeah, you've got a picture of yourself when you're almost dying of a disease. It's very, very common for people to eat too much sugar for long periods of time and then go to a doctor and the doctor tells me, you have diabetes. Right? It's very common and especially in America. Totally brought on just by your diet. Yeah. Yeah. Your body's just freaking out. You're constantly making it processed. Sugar insulins jacked up, spiked all the time, and everything's fucking haywire in your system and your body's like, hey, shithead. Stopped with the skittles that's supposed to eat like this. You dumb fuck you lard ass. What about intermittent fasting? I do that. You do? Yeah. I kind

Speaker 3:          01:26:04       of liked this idea. I love it. Yeah. I eat a for 10 hours a day and some people say you should do eight hours every day. 16. Yeah, every day. Well I take a couple of days off a week. Jimmy Kimmel or Jimmy Kimmel did you read? Uh, wouldn't eat on. He would eat like 500 calories on Monday and Thursday and just like real cat with fasting basically on those days and then eat whatever he wanted on the other days. And that's how, that's how we lost all of his weight. So for two days a week eats like have severely restricted amount of calories and the rest of the week you can eat whatever he wants. Yeah, that seems crazy. Doesn't it seem crazy? He said it was, it's a tricking your body into a tricking your body. And it was so the metabolism was like kicking in and I don't know what the specifics were, but that's what he did when he dropped all that weight. He wasn't exercising and that's what he did. He Monday, Mondays and Thursdays. I wasn't exercising. He hates it now. He exercises and his fit that way and it doesn't restrict his calories as much cause he's physically doing something. But uh, I like the idea of not eating a day. That whole, when people say I hate exercise, it's like people saying, I hate brushing my teeth. Like shut the fuck up. What are you a baby? Just meaning she's just, I don't want to brush my teeth and hate Aa. It's a no, that's back to the couch.

Speaker 3:          01:27:36       I got breathe heavy. Yeah.

Speaker 7:          01:27:38       Eh,

Speaker 8:          01:27:43       he just fucking do it. Shit you don't like to do. It's like, I know water. Right. How the fuck do you expect a jokester come baby? Right. And I like it just come into my head. Come on, come on. Just wait. You wait in my head muscles from a pill.

Speaker 3:          01:28:14       His name is ty, the comedian. Uh, uh, you're a crazy person. Oh Man. Oh Kevin Meeney the Great Kevin, what did he die? Oh, I think his heart, he was just on his laptop and in his living room and just, just had a hard, yeah, I think so. Fuck God, he was funny. But he would wind up like, you were just like a crazy person.

Speaker 8:          01:28:40       Right. It's not right. We're big pants. Pee Fall Dude. I saw Kevin Means

Speaker 3:          01:28:46       19 days funny. Me and my friend Diane Derosa Nice. She was a friend of mine from high school. Yeah. We went to see, um, we went to see him at catch a rising star in Cambridge

Speaker 1:          01:29:02       and this is like, I think maybe I had done an open Mike night or maybe I hadn't even gone on stage yet, but I want to see him and I paid to see him. It's great. The comedy, any crushed so hard that I could, I could, I was, it was unimaginable to me. I couldn't imagine so it could be that funny. So funny. Cause he was in his prime then and it was uh, you know, maybe 180, 200 seat rooms. Yeah. You know, just killing ceiling pow and he's on fire. No escape. He was on fire. That's not right. Okay.

Speaker 4:          01:29:39       Right. And then I opened for him like a caroline's when I was first starting and just watching him just like destroy any breaks into that coffee song. I remember he would do the book coffee song, this song, this uh, uh, all the coffee in Brazil or something like that. He just, he's just killing talking about it and then all of a sudden he's doing this musical number. Like this is a mattress. Oh, he just saw the coffee and all the coffee in Brazil. I think it's up

Speaker 1:          01:30:09       that he got comfortable. He could do whatever he wanted to. He would set spot. There's a spot that some comedians can hit them in the fucking bow tie.

Speaker 8:          01:30:23       This is first tonight. Show them women call me. Plucky

Speaker 1:          01:30:32       you'd have to see it to really, it also, you'd have to be there in 1988, you know, to realize like how crazy what he was doing was, it was so weird. But he got stuck. He got stuck. He went from being a fucking murderer on top of the world. Uncle buck healing in every place. But he got stuck with his act. We had like the same act for the longest time and that act like it didn't work anymore.

Speaker 4:          01:31:00       Well this is cut back to what I was talking about. It's a bit of taking your eye off the ball and like doing other things. He started doing uncle buck. He started doing some movies and the Nino at that time, those people weren't so conscious that you had to keep your act alive. You know what I mean? And you know you take five years off the road and then try and come back. It's, it's not easily done.

Speaker 1:          01:31:21       No. Did you take that much time off?

Speaker 4:          01:31:23       I don't know. I'm just ballparking but I mean, you know, his interests were other places at that time. He was doing tv shows and doing all that other stuff. It's hard. You don't progress because you're not just in it doing that stand up all the time.

Speaker 1:          01:31:37       Well everyone was told back then in particular that you had to do something else. That stand up was a vehicle that got you to the big game and the big game was a television show or a movie. Like when I got news radio, one of the producers of news radio said to me like, why are you still doing standup? Yeah, you're an actor now, right? Yeah, sure. On TV. I was what? Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:32:00       And I remember thinking like, Oh my God, I got to get to a comedy club right now for this makes any sense.

Speaker 4:          01:32:05       I know the fuck you talking about. I mean, the way we think is you do that stuff so more people come to see your show so you can keep doing your shows. That's why you do that stuff. It's not the other way around. But they, that generation saw it as the standup was not something that you buy, but also to be fair, they didn't have theater shows and other avenues weren't kind of carved out where they would, could see stand up as being a special thing. They were just in these hard ass clubs doing six shows a weekend and it's true. And they were like, get me Outta here. When did theater shows start kicking in for people? For the main, for like just regular good comics, not, you know, fairly recently. Really? Yeah. Who Was it? Who else was doing theaters before? Like you know in those days? Well there was Kevin meaney. If Kevin Meeney was peaking now he would be running off and starting to do theater shows. But back then it was just comedy clubs and then television.

Speaker 2:          01:33:05       Yeah. But some people did big places cause I saw people in big places. Like what kind of places? Like Ah, there was theaters, there's definitely rock clubs. There was some of it, but there wasn't like an active touring. When was the first time, man, I'm trying to remember the first time I did a theater.

Speaker 4:          01:33:25       Not that long ago. I bet. Shit, it wasn't like part of the touring business. I mean you had guys that were big, they were doing it, but it wasn't like, you know, you couldn't have a guy that instead of headlining at a club could just go off and do another little theater. It was different. They were like comedy was, you know, it was also a slump, like, like all the clubs were closing

Speaker 2:          01:33:50       years. 20 years. How many 15 years ago that started happening. Yeah. Yeah. That sounds about right. Sounds about right lump, right. There was a comedy.

Speaker 4:          01:34:00       Yeah. When I started in 93 the comedy had had fallen on it.

Speaker 2:          01:34:04       Sas. Oh, you had, you started right when it hit right at the end of it, because I started at the tail end of the boom. The boom was like 84 and when he started in [inaudible] 88 okay. And when I started, it's like people like, ah, you started about four years to like kid. All right. Hey. Yeah. But there was still plenty of work. Yeah, there's a lot. When I shut up clubs at 93 it was over. There were a get discouraged.

Speaker 4:          01:34:30       No, cause it was good for me because all the guys' wedding, yeah. Everyone was quitting. And I was there. I was working for free. I wasn't looking to make money. I was just doing it. Yeah. So all of a sudden I was able to just, if you had a car and would drive the headline or a club you could get on stage.

Speaker 2:          01:34:46       Well there was also this weird attitude that some people would have that land, like they were getting screwed because the work was going away. Yeah. Like you were getting screwed. Like what? And I remember thinking like, wow, what a way of looking

Speaker 3:          01:34:57       at things that as that you are personally getting screwed. Yeah. Because this entire industry was oversaturated with a bunch of hacks. Hacks. Yeah. Yeah. Real has someone was talking about is there going to be a bus now? Because there's been so much comedy out there and stuff. It's not a dearth of shitty comedy now. There's a lot of comedy, but it's a lot of good comedy that's progressing and moving forward. The art for a lot of booming different voices, there's a lot going on. It's not, there was a bust back then for a reason. People had 40 minutes of material and they just pounded people with it relentlessly and they never wrote and they never were traveling constantly. It was shitty.

Speaker 1:          01:35:40       Yeah. And there was a lot of these formula guys that would go, uh, you know, they would just have some fucking like really obvious premise and they would work at like a comedian,

Speaker 3:          01:35:53       say they had a way of talking him like her comedian. What is this mutual of Omaha's wild kingdom playing out in my kitchen. Yeah. Yeah. Cause you said it was really funny for a while.

Speaker 1:          01:36:09       Something's happening now. We're French comics are getting exposed for stealing American comedy verbatim now and, and, and translating to fringe like, and there was a video that came out today that showed Dave Chappelle and then some French comic ripping them off, Jerry Seinfeld and then some French comic rick ripping them off or ripping them off with the same hand motions. The same doing his act in French, just doing exact and French as if they were the only human beings who spoke both English and French. This was something that we had heard about forever from the Montreal Comedy Festival. Oh really? Yeah. Because the Montreal comedy festival, not the people that perform there, but we would perform in Montreal and we would talk to guys who were comics that's, that spoke English and French. Right. And a lot of the guys that spoke French, sometimes they would tell you they did French shows. Yeah, I go, I was, I like, that's weird. Like you do French shows, an English shows and they go, it's interesting, but there's, there's a bunch of comics that are famous only in the French speaking world of touring comedy and they just steal from American comics and just say their stuff in French. I go, no, there's, oh yeah, it's blatant. Well, and there's, there's a handful of comedians that were making a living turing, so three years just stealing everybody's,

Speaker 3:          01:37:28       I love having you here. It is here. I love how they steal from the biggest guys. So stupid. Yeah. Yeah. I mean literally this is a whole kit while they're getting a guy from 2004 so this is there going, God, this is like a Hashtag. Me Too. It's hilarious. Copied comic mix. Yeah. 85 or 86 to 2005 well that's Gad. Do you know him? Yeah. How do you know him? He, they call him the Jerry Seinfeld of wow. Of a France. Well he took that shit literally. He's good. He's good friends with Jerry. Yeah. Well stealing Jerry Shit. Oh Man. Yeah. It's uh, it's interesting. And they're using a Hashtag copy comic in Hashtag copy comic mix did, this is like French speaking comedians who don't do this. It was like enough is enough. You fucks and they're mad and they're coming out with all, yeah. Maybe. Maybe there is a real thing.

Speaker 3:          01:38:30       I was thinking the other day, I heard you talking with, uh, I think it was Neil Brennan. Yeah. Then you were talking about a Jannie. Richard. Jenny. Yeah. Who I love Jenny too. One of the greats and then I was underrated comedian of all time. I think. So. Great. But then when you listened to his stuff, the it is very much of the time, I think are all comedy is very much of the time. Sure. It really like even our stuff from, you know, 15 years ago, it was of that moment. And like you listen to Jenny and he's, uh, he's so funny and so, but he's definitely have that ear. Like if I were to try and turn my 15 year old onto to him, it wouldn't fly. I don't know. I think if you, if you made your 15 year old listen to a steaming pile of me.

Speaker 3:          01:39:20       Yeah, yeah. 15 year old boy or girl parts of it. Girl. Yeah. Parts of it. But I mean it's, and it's not, this isn't a knock, I think. No, you're saying, you know what I mean? We, it's just, comedy is very much of the given take of the culture and what's happening and there's some stuff holds up and some stuff because like, because Richard is the first guy to do the lobster and their tank, uh, sandy wasn't even, he wasn't even, there was a guy in Boston that was doing, and even before him, oh, really? Named Don Galvin, who had all Gavin hilarious bit about a lobster and a tank. Oh really? Gavin's like the king. He was, he was a monster. I'm a monster. But see what happens is he breaks that, he breaks that code like Righty, comes up with that bit and then 15 years later we've seen shades of it.

Speaker 3:          01:40:17       So then by the time my kid here is that, it's like, oh, that old thing. And they don't realize at that moment when Don Gavin comes up with that on his way into the club, it's genius, right? Yeah, no, yeah, for sure. And there was a bunch of people had similar premises back then. Yeah. You know, was there was a bunch of bits about game shows, you know, there was a bunch, a bunch of bits. Right. There's a lot of different bits that people just had their own take on these individual things. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Gavin, so funny. Oh, he was a monster. Yeah. He's one of those guys that left Boston. No.

Speaker 2:          01:40:54       Yeah, Boston was a s a dirty mistress. She fucking catch you around. Yeah. Crushed your dreams. Yeah. It was so good there that they stayed, stayed and have long careers though, right? Yep. But they should have been monsters. Yeah. Like dawn Gavin should be, in my opinion, he should be right up there with all the greats. People should know him the same way they know Robin Williams and all these other standup comics that are huge. Maybe even bigger. Such a natural, such a natural. So good. Especially at the time, oh my God. In 88 when I first started, Oh really? He would show up half cocked, drinking hand, go on stage and just crush to the point where you just like you couldn't, he couldn't believe how good his timing was. Yeah. And he had that, that fucking Boston we had talking about that Irish there right now when I vacation I went to Puerto Rico.

Speaker 2:          01:41:49       I loved it. But fucking so many Puerto Ricans, I don't even know how they afford it. So expensive. And I'm a vegetarian and I hey meet and shit. But it's like the timing of it was, everything was a throwaway and the tag was a throwaway to another tag. You were laughing at Shit you couldn't believe you were hearing and so brilliant. And then it really becomes, you know, there's certain stuff like I'll see like the old, I was watching old Jack Benny on youtube, like [inaudible] and some of it really is as funny as sitcoms that are out today. Really? Yes. Some of it isn't. It nails it, but most of it is, like I said, it's, it just kind of dates itself. I was watching an ad for these Jackie gleason dvds. Jackie gleason had a show. Yeah. I didn't know you had a show and the honeymooners was a part of that show.

Speaker 2:          01:42:50       Ah, it was like a sketch. Yeah. So it was a variety show and that they're there, um, playing this ad for a DVD, for the variety show. So my wife walks into the kitchen, I'm watching this on TV shows, what the fuck are you watching? And I'm like, look at this. This is like a time machine. Like you get to watch what people thought was amazing in 1960 or whatever this was. Yeah. Yeah. Look at that that way. He goes, Jackie gleason show Jackie gleason show. Yeah. Look, there's the honeymooners at the bottom. Joe The bartender. Wow. Fenwick Babbitt. Reggie Venn gleason the third. What the fuck? Just doing a whole bunch of character. They called him the greatest. He called himself the greatest CBS TV fast. Wow. How weird. Yeah. That was his show. Eight to nine o'clock on Saturdays brought to you by schick smaller. Let's see if he can find a clip it.

Speaker 2:          01:43:51       Oh, the bat. So weird to watch, man. They all smoked. They were constantly smoking like while they're on the set, they would like light up and they're doing their sketches and they had like a cigarette in their hand while they're doing sketches. A lot of them were a sponsored by the cigarettes. Oh, that makes sense. That makes sense. Jack Benny show, they would stop and just start talking about it. Due to the nature of the rare, rare kinescope recordings utilized in this tape. Picture quality will vary in comparison to modern video technology. However, it becomes the historical significance of the subject matter. They are included. Very nice. Look, this is it, man. This is the beginning of television comedy. Damn. Look at what it was. Looks like American scene. Yeah. Wow. It's basically a poster. You're just pushing it on a poster to see what year this is Jamie? 52 62 62 so this is right around the time or he was in the hustler. Oh Man. Was that the best? Look at this. Look at that giant pack of Marlboro cigarettes. Why? What does she say? But back it up a little bit so I can hear what she said about Marlborough. Give me some volume and back it up. The music. So great. I love this stuff. New York Shit. Hey, the entertainment capital of the world.

Speaker 9:          01:45:14       You get a lot to live with a moral rule now in green.

Speaker 2:          01:45:23       I bet those cows would love to come back and do some fucking meet two speeches. Imagine what kind of meat to shit was happening back then. Those were cave people aren't Connie, right? Fun Art Carney was with him. Wow. Played Norton Tammy's mirror and his orchestra and a way we've got front of a live audience. Boy, there was nothing to look forward to back then. I mean a couple of times and then before you know it, your wife was pregnant and you had a bunch of kids and yeah, just paying your bills. Give me a goddamn laugh. Look at this. These gals running around. It's just, yeah, you'd have a little, uh, this is showbiz. I mean, this came from, you know, now how you do the shit back, but do you think Jackie gleason got to bang any of these checks? Absolutely. [inaudible] 60 to [inaudible] 62 I the greatest, but I mean, you probably could barely get it up. He was chain smoking chain, smoking, drinking, long, big drinker hammered all the time. Big Time drinker. And by this time it's probably deep into his forties, right? There's probably, yeah. Grossly unhealthy. Yeah. How Sony was. How old do you think Jackie gleason wasn't? 62 here he comes. Yeah, we have that face. Wow. He was the greatest, but certainly was an original. Oh Man. Yeah. Did it energy. Fuck, look at him. Energy Pinky ring. When we hear some scheduling laws getting laughs, he hasn't opened his mouth.

Speaker 9:          01:47:01       I got 38 more weeks to go. 38 weeks for this coffee is bigly.

Speaker 2:          01:47:24       It tastes it. Yes, and she walks away.

Speaker 9:          01:47:27       We keep might not be long enough. Probably a sponsor. That was the joke. Cattlemen. We've got a long show. We want to get it all in. So jam I little traveling music,

Speaker 10:         01:47:37       any dances, hook it back. There was no hipaa places back then. Wow.

Speaker 2:          01:47:48       This is the it all year. You had the dance yet to sing. You had to tell jokes, but it's weird to watch. So it was her. Wouldn't you love to go back in time and bang some hot lady from 1962 I bet it was different back then. Yeah. Wild. When was birth control? When a birth control come out? Sixties so I feel like that's where people changed what they are because back then there was this mad desire. Right. But there was also insane consequences if you had sex with somebody, like, oh, we met him again. You're going to get mad of a person. Yeah, like this, this, this, this drive, this poll, this cyclone of lust. It leads you to this one person. Ramifications, not just ramifications, but life changing, life altering results in consequences. Right. Then the bill comes in, you have the sexual revolution.

Speaker 2:          01:48:43       He was started bagging everywhere. Weirdness. Women were in control of their own destiny. Yeah, but just w what changed what it means to have sex. It's we, it became this weirdness. It became for pleasure. Yeah. It wasn't just to, yeah. I mean it was always for pleasure, but it's always for pleasure. But the odds of that pleasure biting you in the ass, like, and people must have just assumed you're going to have a few babies mamas by the time we got to a certain age. Right. But as a woman, if you had a baby out of wedlock, you were ostracized. Yeah. You were seen as, you know, bad news. That is crazy. Right? Yeah. You were seeing the guy who wasn't, there was nothing, no reflection on Amie. He wasn't even in the picture. She's just like a whore. Fuck what a shit deal for women. That is. Yeah. It's pretty bad. Yeah. But there's some people that argue that the pill and that changing the nature of sexual intercourse change the way women interact with men, which changed the way women sort of like view themselves. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:49:48       This is not necessarily all positive. I was found out to be confusing argument and well, the, the argument being that with, um, like that it's natural for a woman to be very selective about who she had sex with and that it's natural for a woman to, you know, want a guy who's getting his shit together and all these different factors in place before she allows demand to procreate with her, but that the pill comes along and then all of a sudden women could just have one night stands and they could be like the chicks from sex and the city and uh, you know, just bang up a storm and have no consequences but like a guy. Yeah. But this led to like a deeply unfulfilling narrative. Never a lot of women sort of found themselves repeating. I said it's a very tortured conversation because I'm not a woman because I don't know what their actual, yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:50:46       Doesn't know. But that's also, that also can be set of men. I mean just that, just that scenario, just to have sex, just to, just to keep banging and have no emotional connection. I know guy friends, it ended up in a very lonely place because of that, you know?

Speaker 1:          01:51:01       Well, think of this way, right? If you're 20 and that's the case. Yeah. Everybody's like, oh, he's having a good time. Right? If you're 60 yeah. And that's the case. Like, aw, that poor bastard. Yeah. Yeah. Well he does get hookers. Yeah. Brings him back to his mansion and it seems to do coke and they dance. It's like, do you remember? Oh, commit. I love the picture of a 60 year old guy just dancing in a lonely place. Jack Nicholson was hair all fucked up the whole bed. Had a delic first plan la with a robe.

Like so people watch that and watch any hit movie this year. So there's um, you never know what's going to hit kids. There's this fucking show that my seven year old loves. Yeah. And the show's called haters back off and there's this girl named Miranda something or another. She's a youtube sensation. Miranda sings. Yeah. Yeah. She's a youtube sensation for doing stuff like really badly on purpose and pretending that she's, you know, she's killing it and she's got this Netflix show that I watched with them and it's, the fucking show is not a bad show. It's an interesting show. It's weird. It's almost like a female Napoleon dynamite type situation, you know? But she's talented. But my daughter who's seven loves it and she does a Miranda impression thing. Hilarious about like whatever. She's nailed it. Split some of the shows, like she had this one about being famous and about like refreshing. I constantly refreshing her page to find out how many likes and thumbs up and thumbs down. She goes. Super depressing. Oh really? She was crying, her mother screaming at her, telling her how selfish she is and the whole thing is like, it was really weird. She just lives in studio city. It's just like a actress in the valley. She was balling out of control. Now she out everywhere.

Speaker 2:          01:55:44       She does live shows what kind of live show. She comes out and sings like Miranda got all these young girls just pack the place. Yeah. Yeah. There's weird is weird money in these things. She's funny. She's, she's very like, that's very like question marks kind of old school. He has his big cartoon lips, you know, she puts the lipstick all the way around the limb on the outside of the lips. Yeah. It's um, yeah. My kids were imitating her for awhile. 5 million instagram followers. It's pictures of spaghetti in her budget stuff. It's so weird and her making weird faces. You guys, you guys. But meanwhile she's nailing it with seven year olds because really a seven year old, she was sick from school yesterday. She watched it all day. She fucking loves it. I was on the tonight show once with a miley cyrus. This was like, I dunno, eight years ago or something.

Speaker 2:          01:56:42       And she's so famous. She, the point where she was just completely huge, you know, and I uh, my kids came along because they wanted to meet her and my kids were little. And uh, I was like, wow, she's really nailing it. She's like huge and show business and stuff. And then my kids come back, we take a picture and she's like, yeah, okay. Yeah. And she had to like squat down to take pictures with these two little people. I was like, that's the price he has to pay. What ticket for a whole day he'll be squatting down and taking pictures with little people. It's bad for the lower back. All the squatting and posing. We were talking about, um, the other, by the way, a bunch of people got mad that cause we were, we were talking about that Logan Paul Guy who had taken a photo or videos with dead people, the math side, the way we were discussing the Logan Paul thing, people were saying, I defended him.

Speaker 2:          01:57:37       I don't think I defended him. Did I? I don't think I did. I don't remember. We were high as fuck. It was me and a red band wearing NASA outfits. Don't take it seriously by the way. And uh, I read into it more. I didn't know exactly what he did, but I run into more, apparently he was mocking the body's like there's people's, like their hands were bloated and blue and he was making fun of it all. And so he's a bad guy apparently the super cut of like everything he did and he did a bunch of other things on top of that. Apparently it's this thing and aware of, well he's a creep. He's trying to be outrageous, trying to get attention. Totally. And it was working. He's got a ton of people. This is the same thing though, right? It's like these people that you're like, what?

Speaker 2:          01:58:17       What did they do? How do they have, he's got what you find. He's got how many millions of this and that and know exactly that the guy's brother. Cause the other one who lives next to a friend of mine bought a $7 million house, 20 years old, but I $7 million house. Yeah. Kill calabasas killing it. No, he's one of those people that love him and hate him equally. He has. But even the people that hate him still have to see what he's doing. It's like that kind of thing. Yeah. It's super confusing. Yeah. Yeah. It's celebrity. It's just that so that, you know, and he's outrageous I guess. I don't know anything about them. It's also just access like everyone has access to youtube. So what youtube is now is like a television show that you keep in your pocket. Yeah. You can just constantly, yeah, they're like, there's a video that I posted yesterday of a poor bastard.

Speaker 2:          01:59:10       This fucking guy raised a squirrel that he kinda the cute little squarely on the rehabilitated it. And they got the little squirrel, squirrel. We're gonna, everything's gonna be fine. He's like putting it back into nature. It's time. It's about time. Little Guy. And he puts a little squirrel on the tree and he's like, you just, you go back your way. Good luck where you live now. And he's got the squirrel on the tree for all of 15 seconds and the cat comes along and Jackson with ridiculous speed. I'm gonna hear the volume. This is my favorite part. It's the screaming. Here we go.

Speaker 2:          01:59:53       Oh, that cat, that cat was on that fucker so fast. But cat climbs up. The tree, grabs him and just takes off. Just ran with him in his mouth. And that's like you. It's more than you do in that with a cat. Like if you had a cat in your mouth, they, the cat would be smaller in your mouth in that hamster. Right? Squirrel would be, that's how big the fucking cat. So raw. Here it is. Oh, that's a wrap, son. Almost a million people saw it. Cats don't give up. They don't give a fuck. My cat's a killer. Oh Dude. They're ruthless. Ruthless. Ruthless just kills everything and anything they can. Yeah. If you ever seen the numbers for how many things cats kill in North America? No Bill Yin's of birds. Billions, billions, billions, billions of mammals and billions of birds. What's so gangsters? They kill them and don't even eat them.

Speaker 2:          02:00:52       No, they just kill him. Yeah. They like the sport tastes. Food, foods, easy. Cats that live in the wild or indoor pets are allowed to roam outdoors. Killed between 1.4 billion to as many as 3.7 billion birds in the continental US each year says a new study that escalates a decade's old debate over feline threat to native animals and it shows his cute little cat with the burdens mouth. They're monsters. Yeah, and just brings him and drops him in my kids' beds. Like this question, people also ask to cats, kill birds. I keep leaving my birds and they're dead. Fluffy would never do that, sweetie. Flat fees. I didn't see a feather in its full well there. You know Mike? Yeah, my cat drops road and all in my children's hair while they sleep in her bed. Oh my God. Dropped a rat in my daughter's bathroom with a leak in her shower cap.

Speaker 2:          02:01:57       Really to mark his territory. Now the rat was just scared shitless and was running. We couldn't still behind the toilet and stuff and we finally got it out. I might to the next day it goes to put on a shower cap and it's just filled with p rat rat pee. Ah, you could fucking die from the disgusting. You know that you can get leprosy from armadillos. No, of course. I don't know that it's one of the few, one of the few ways that a human can contract leprosy from an animal leprosies apparently is 95% of us are immune to leprosy. But you can get leprosy from Armadillo. Oh my God. Yeah. So if you eat an Armadillo, cook the shit out of it. Folks wear rubber gloves. How armadillos can spread leprosy. That's a dinosaur too, isn't it? That tank, like creatures are the only mammals besides us known to carry leprosy.

Speaker 2:          02:02:54       Oh my Lord. Yeah. Apparently though those things taste pretty good. People, uh, people eat armadillos speak to. Yeah. Yeah. They opened him up and it's kind of a fatty meat grill it and uh, yeah, people marinate it and grill it and talking your head. I mean why is a lobster delicious and that things gross because it walks on the road cause he's, he its beady eyes at night when you're driving to vegas capable. Why is it dear delicious then? Cause deers walking the road to they're not as delicious dear. Yeah. I don't like dear so much. Jerry. You, you like to cooking it right? Yeah, probably not. How come you eat and elk? That's a deer elk. It's a giant elk. A giant elk is a giant deer. What is different though? Well maybe in fairness, I haven't had deer in a long time when I didn't know how to cook.

Speaker 2:          02:03:40       Well also it's how people take care of it as a big issue. There's things called tarsal glands that exists, um, on the deer's legs that are particularly active when they're horny, which is when a lot of times when you hunt them, which is called the Rut and those Tarsa Glenn's, if they're not handled correctly while you're skinning the deer, you can leak some of that stuff on the meat and it'll greatly taint the way the meat tastes. Maybe I had some of that. There's that. And then there's also people don't take care of it. Like from the moment they kill it and like how long does it take before it's actually cooled down and dressed? And this was like in New Jersey, I'm sure nothing was being done correctly. Problems, nothing was done right. And that's where I was born. It's done right there. Born and raised. I know exactly who killed it will party an ease and any born in, uh, I was born in passaic. Oh, okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah. New Jersey. Deers. It probably is a ton of them. Oh yeah, they were really, I mean it's really

Speaker 4:          02:04:38       there every week.

Speaker 1:          02:04:39       Well, New Jersey has an interesting situation now because the new governor has decided to stop bear hunting. Yeah. New Jersey, New Jersey has the highest population of Brown bear per capita in the country. Cheese New Jersey does, which people don't, that doesn't make sense to them. Bears. You're like, wait a minute. Yeah. You say bear and New Jersey, New Jersey has enormous bear population.

Speaker 4:          02:05:03       A huge am I the way we're talking about it over the holidays, my sister, my sister had a, uh, her dog was going crazy, um, at the woodpile and my sister went and put a big tarp over it. The next day the dog is going crazy again at the top at the woodpile and she's like, why is he going so, so nuts? And she goes outside to get the dog and the a big ass bear comes out from under the tarp. This just a New Jersey just starts like coming out. She was so thankful that she didn't just like poke her head under there.

Speaker 1:          02:05:40       Well, we've played videos. These two giant bears battling it out in far rockaway where they tackle over each other and they're slamming to these garbage pails and garbage goes flying. They knock over a, um, a mailbox and they go right out into traffic and first flying all over the drunk fight. Yeah. They're fighting for garbage. It was the fight for access to these areas where these people drop their garbage off. Like turf. Yeah. It's, and this new governor, because Chris away, Chris, Chris Christie, such a Slob, like people hated him so much and he was the Republican, so they hired this ultra liberal social justice warrior type new governor who's decided he has his ideological opposition to the bear hunt. Even though the bear hunt in New Jersey is like really strictly controlled by wildlife biologist. They've done it to try to keep the populations healthy. And there was also the situation that happened in rutgers a couple of years ago where a kid was killed by a bear. Oh really? Yeah. One of the students at rutgers. Yeah. Sad. [inaudible] students was a wandering through the woods with his friends and they got fucking attacked by a bear and a bear killed one of the kids. Oh my God. A picture of it before it killed him to, this happened that the stress factory right next door in the parking lot. Um, Vinnie brand was there. She was doing and he had the phone and everything.

Speaker 4:          02:06:58       He was doing probably phone calls to the bear's den here. We got your daughter down here. She's really drunk, sir.

Speaker 1:          02:07:09       So the wildlife biologist put a number like, you know, the bears can be healthy and conflicts with people can be reduced if we have, you know, the bears reduced to shutting them out. Like it's not an issue of, uh, they're in danger. Ranger not endangered in any way, shape or form. It's the opposite. They're over abundant. And, but this is a problem with people with when it comes to bears or what my friend Steve Rinella likes to call charismatic megafauna and their people look at animals and they anthropomorphize them and start thinking of them as being Yogi and booboo and our little friends that live in the forest, they don't realize like these are no, these are animals, man. You, you have to, you can't have animals there. Giant predators and close proximity to human beings without monitoring and having wildlife biologists, stoic, calm, objective people who really understand animals tell you exactly how many there should be in this area and when it becomes a problem.

Speaker 1:          02:08:07       Right. And so they're going to have an issue in New Jersey the same way they're going to have an issue in British Columbia. They outlawed Grizzly bear hunting and British Columbia this year for the exact same reason. Oh really? And they did it in British Columbia because they're not endangered. No, no, no. It was a ton of them. Ton of them. Not only do they not endangered, but the people that voted on it are the people that live in Vancouver where there are new grizzly bears. But Vancouver, even though it's the population center of a British Columbia, it's where all the people live. It's by no means representative of what most of British Columbia looks like. It's a British Columbia's woods forest. And those people have to deal with fucking grizzly bears, grizzly bears. So they said they're not allowed to hunt them at all and a lot of them anymore now. And so also it's a big part of their economy because there's a lot of these people that made a living by guiding people on these grizzly bear hunts.

Speaker 1:          02:08:59       Uh, and it's gonna also devastate the economy when it comes to their moose and elk hunting populations too. Because a lot of people went there to moose hunt, elk hunt and deer hunt, but the bears. So why did the populations are going to go up. The bears are going to start eating more moose and elk and deer. So what's their reason? Animal rights activists have been infiltrated the government and these people that are like leaning left and have sort of a delusional perception of what wildlife is. They've decided to push these laws through that people didn't vote on. By the way, this is not like something, there was this giant statewide vote and people decided to end grizzly bear hunts. Well, what's crazy about the Jersey thing is it he just gotten an office and the bear problems this years it's been a problem, but that's while you're hunting.

Speaker 1:          02:09:47       Well, I think that people are doing it for the right reasons. I think they're wrong, but they're doing it for the right reasons. They're doing it because they think that hunting's cruel and they're doing it because they think that these are trophy hunts and that people that there's no, there was no merit to it, but what they don't understand is you're probably going to have to hire people to kill these bears anyway, which is what we do in California. You know, California Mountain Lion hunting was outlawed in the 1990s but since then they spent millions of dollars killing mountain lions every year. Oh really? Not millions every year. But what they sell downs overall, a crew to go get a send out professional hunters with dogs usually to go after problem mountain lions and the ones that go after, almost all of them have pets and their stomach. Oh really? That's what they eat. I hey dogs. Really? Yeah. It's a big part of their diet.

Speaker 1:          02:10:41       We can, we have to control. I mean it's fucked up. Yeah. Well No, we're, we're in their world. Yes. But it's not their world anymore. Just like it's not, you know, this isn't where the fucking dinosaurs live either stupid or we build homes all through here. Change. Yeah. And right now we live here and I'm more concerned about us than I am with a God damn mountain lions in there. They just ate fluffy mountain lions. You say fluffy. You fuck. Are there a lot of mountain lions? Like is it the number is big or California has good numbers. Yeah. My friend works at to hone ranch and they have it to hone ranch just outside of Bakersfield, which you went about an hour and a half from here. And they have a, um, what it was called trail camera. That's a post out in front of a, um, a, a pond and out of this one pond they got pictures of 16 different mountain lines.

Speaker 1:          02:11:30       Wow. Do you ever run into him when you go up and no, Ron, your runs. I've seen mountain lions twice in my life. One I saw in Colorado and one I saw in Santa Barbara, I saw one in Montecito in a car. I was driving, it was driving, it was, it had tunes on, it was listening to Miley Cyrus. I was in the car and I saw this thing and I thought it was a coyote. It was running across the road and know, Oh look at its tail. I saw this big thick bouncy tail. And I'm like, oh my God, it's a cat. And I realized a, Geez, it was weird. It's weird, but I'm looking at something for a second, two seconds maximum, right. What I'll find the cat. What do you got, Jamie? Oh, Jesus Christ wildlife camera catches uncolored mountain lion roaming the Hollywood hills.

Speaker 1:          02:12:23       I'm like, God, that looks the size of that fucker. That is like, yeah, that's like from Africa and this is just a couple of months ago was October 31st that's right by pauly shore's house. It is pauly shore. Pauly shore. It turns into that at night when no one's watching it, so I held the light twice down. Hardly working. Most of the time it's just, that's crazy. That's like something you'd see on Safari. It's a big one too. Boy. Look at the muscles and the fucker. This is, this is a halloween 2017 yeah, craze. That is our uncolored mountain lions had, it means they don't even know where this one game for. Oh my God. I mean that's the Hollywood hills. That's like right next to people's homes. Well, I stick my dog to a dog park up there. A dog park. That's a awful laurel one. There's a dog park, a at the top of Laurel, like right when you go dead.

Speaker 1:          02:13:13       If you coming up over studio city, when you go down, there's a dog park out there. If you go to the right and one of the, they had a big sign there that said, be on the lookout for mountain lions. If mountain lions attack you fight back. And I'm like, God, no, fuck am I looking at here? She's, I just want to go for a run. I'm just here to Hollywood, my dog taking my dog to the park and sort of see some girls and throw the ball around. That's a lot of that is just because of our attitude about these animals and that's also why you see very few deer in California. So there's like pros and cons. The pro is you very rarely get in accidents with deer like Eww, that's so uncommon in California. That's true. And it's because of mountain lions.

Speaker 1:          02:13:58       I always figured they just weren't a indigenous to the area. Oh No, they're everywhere. They used to be way more of them when I first moved here. Really? Yeah, man. When I moved, I moved to the valley in 94 and I see deer all the time. All the time. You seem in the Hollywood hills all the time. I've never seen a deer here. I see. I saw him a couple of days ago out in thousand oaks area here. Yeah, but they're very rare in California. Anywhere else like this? Like if you're in long island. Oh yeah. Highland is a giant problem with deer everywhere. Everywhere. Higher snipers go take care of them. She, they do. They're all over New Jersey. They felt like a pass everywhere. It's like mosquitoes because they don't have any predators like mountain lions or coyotes or very, very few coyotes. And the natural order is why we don't see him.

Speaker 1:          02:14:49       Well, it's because here they've kind of got a point. And that point is you can let the mountain lines take care of the population. And then when the mountain lions come into a problem, when they've come problem that you can get something called the depredation permit, which a woman got in the Malibu mountains because she ran an Alpaca farm and these mountain lion one mountain lion killed like I think 10 or 11 alpacas and a goat. Oh my God. In one session and one session. And it was the same thing. It's like we were talking about cats with house cats. They just canceled. It just killed him. [inaudible] me. She had a good old time. Oh, I'll pack a pen, couldn't help himself, Jack and all of them, but when this woman got a depredation permit to kill the mountain line, she got a ton of death threats from people.

Speaker 1:          02:15:39       They were saying, you fucking bitch. I'll kill you. You touch that cat. And then she's like, fuck this. I'm not doing anything. She, she felt very exposed. People who were, she were, they knew where her farm was. Jeez. Yeah. It's scary. She fuck. Yeah. People get really nutty, man. When it comes to animals, they get a week, but it's certain animals, right? Like these people have this weird thing about that squirrel and then the cat came along, killed that fucking scroll. Guess what bitch? You've been feeding that cat, right? That's yours. You made that monster and you let that thing roam around outside, which is just, you're asking for it to kill everything it runs into. That's what they do. It's what they do. Yeah. And it's probably super charged up about it too because he gets to do it all the time and the pride in front of it's family to do it for the family.

Speaker 1:          02:16:26       That's what they like the most. Yeah. That cat did that in front of you because that's what he wants you to see. Right. They look at me. Oh, it's scary. It is. Hey, I saw the tank. You want to try it some day? What do you wanna try it? I don't know. When can I? Um, well, well, we'll work something out. We'll come up with a a time where you can come in. We should have, I should have had you come in early today. You could done it before the podcast. Oh really? Yeah. How long do you go in there? I like to do at least an hour. Last time I did a, just a couple days ago that did two hours, just floating there for an hour and it's climbing. Relax, listen to music or silence. I silent your silence. I'd log it like that. Yeah, I'd like to try it.

Speaker 1:          02:17:09       Yeah, we'll do it next time for sure. That'd be cool. For sure. This facility is amazing. It's pretty crazy, right? It's so great. I figured fuck it. Why not? Right. So great. To me it was one of those things where, Oh look, all right, if I could just do whatever I wanted to do, what would I do right? Then I go, wait a minute. I think I could do whatever I want to hear. Like I should just do it. It's really great Jamie. So she saw me a gym membership. I'm going to start working on, you know, did you get a key fob?

Speaker 1:          02:17:39       Yeah, it's pretty Shim equipment actually comes this week. It's, it's, it's insane. It was just like a whole, it's like a gym. It can we, I have an apartment. Well it would be a real gym next week cause rogue athletics is outfitting it. Like a real gem. That'd be a rowing machine. There's going to be an Airdyne bike is going to be a squat cage and she's full range of kettlebells and fucking steel plates and that. Yeah, they're doing the whole thing. Fuck is awesome. Well, you can go to the gym and get annoyed or it could just work out here. Why not? Yeah. Just come on by. What's the sauna? The Sauna and then in a house. Yes. You could for sure. Yeah. If you have the room for it and they have varying sizes of Saunas that they did a big one. Yeah. That is pretty quite honestly that, that one's too big for me.

Speaker 1:          02:18:36       I mean I've only gone in Indian by myself. Yeah. But, uh, you could have couple people in there in that one. So the idea of that one was, what was that room? It was like a closet before that we turned it into a sauna. Yeah. Yeah. Right. Um, we just decided like this is a spot like that. Why? Okay. Put it there. Can you just run that size? Oh really? And apparently they make them all sorts of different sizes, so they do. Yeah. And uh, it fit perfect, dude. Here's the thing. I've been dealing with, um, tendinitis in my elbow and it was, it's really been kind of annoying. It's really been Bob 10 to nine. This is a weird one man. And have you ever gotten it before? No. I have a, what they called Golf Golfer's elbow, the inside where tennis elbows, the outside.

Speaker 1:          02:19:22       It's been annoying me for a few months now and uh, it comes from a overdoing chin up. So I was doing too many chin ups and I was being a meathead where I was just pushing through, you know, like it would start to annoy me and I would just keep going. Right. But one session in the sauna significantly reduced like the pain in it. And then the second session did the same thing and then I did it again yesterday and I'm like, I barely feel that tendinitis now for real. Yeah. And so just getting the inflammation out. Yeah, I think it has a, I think it just has an overall effect on inflammation throughout your whole body. You know? It's pretty cool. Yeah. You got a spare set onto where you can climb in today? I'm going in right after the show. No.

Speaker 2:          02:20:14       What does this one James? Like a personal infrared. These are like probably 1500 bucks I think, or less. You just throw it in your house and they also make, um, um, were you, uh, you lie down in them. That's ridiculous. They have one. I was lie down in it like a suit and a use. Zip it up. Up to your neck. Let's see that one with the blue down there with that lined lying down is keep going. Scroll down. Scroll down. That one with the blue. You're your cursor's, right? Yeah, that, that's ridiculous. Yeah. You climb like gold. It's like the old brady bunch of cafes. He gets up your body and it's apparently really good for you. Really? You look like she looks like the Blueberry and Willy Wonka. That's her pussy. Pussy pussies. Oh my God. It's on fire.

Speaker 1:          02:21:00       She's on fire. It looks chic.

Speaker 2:          02:21:05       I like a nice sauna. It's great hot. I don't like the steam so much. Hmm. Uh, I think there's benefits

Speaker 1:          02:21:11       steam too, but the real benefit of the sauna is the fact that you can get to 176 degrees in a dry heat. Your body can tolerate it. But if you got to 176 degrees and steam your fucking Nipples, a burn on fire, right. That you'd feel the wet because you basically be poaching yourself.

Speaker 2:          02:21:29       Right. My friend really believes in the steam steam. He's a big drinker and he steams every morning and it just all comes out of, it's how I've been. Please. That's dying. Big drinkers are all just ways of managing the big drinking. Yeah. He just got steam it out. I'm all right.

Speaker 1:          02:21:51       I think Sano will probably help more if he could figure out a way to not. I mean, I think he's probably getting some benefit from like being in the steam, but I bet sauna would be even better for him. And it's again the same thing. Reducing inflammation. Yeah. I'd like to be less puffy from inflammation. Russians love it. Five time champion. Timo cow. Conan had become adept at enduring the tournament's 110 degrees Celsius. 203 Fahrenheit heat lasting over 16 minutes. She 2003 but he died, didn't he? Next guy that the guy who we're competing, they

Speaker 2:          02:22:26       have poses a competition, right? Yeah. World's Sauna Championship. Oh my God, what the Fuck is wrong with people? Come on. I'm a the very best at cooking myself, but not dying. 16 minutes. That's not long. 230 degrees. Let me tell you something, man. I was at 210 degrees. I can't even fucking imagine someone going 20 degrees hotter than that like my nipples were hurting and I was like, why my nipple so hard? Why they were so sore. Why did you do that watch? I cranked it up and then I came in here to do my ads and when I did the ads, I left it on too long. I just got super hot. That's my jam. It says that this one guy goes in for bursts of 130 to 140 degrees Celsius. I just looked that up. That's 284 degrees Fahrenheit, four minute bursts, todd, 280 degrees, four minute bursts, so he's essentially doing like the opposite of the crowd.

Speaker 2:          02:23:22       Janet Chamber, right? It says you can get what's called hyperthermia. If you do this in a bad way, this heavy bathers in favor of the hottest temperatures always wear felt caps and slippers because the wooden surfaces tend to get very high. God, that sounds adorable. Felt the haves and slippery the going in like Robin Hood, Robin Hood Cook things at two 50 yeah, all the time. No. Yeah. A lot of times when you cook like a potato Wa one 50 pull it out of the oven. I cook at elk steak. I'll cook it at two 50 and I put an internal thermometer and when it gets to 125 degrees and I pull it, yeah, Jack the temperature up and I see, or the outside, it's time to eat. Three 20 it says one 60 Fahrenheit is three 20 for short spells. 320 degrees. Ooh, so these people, aren't they?

Speaker 2:          02:24:15       This is a whole nother psychosis. This isn't bound inflammation. This is not just what people do. Always leave it, just leave it. You can't leave it alone. We had a good thing going. People that tattoo their eyeballs. Yeah. Why wasn't good enough to write. You only live once and your forehead. You have to Tatiana, I balls black. He couldn't stop. You have to be like towed from x men. Why do you have to do that? Why are you putting things into your eyeballs? No one wants you to do that, but people can't help it. They can't leave things alone. If they get one piercing in their face, they want to get the cheek piercings and knows purely this guy got his fucking eyeballs turned blue like you remember when you were a kid? No one had their face tattooed. Nobody. No one. And now look at this and another one. Yeah, full eyeball Tattoo Solace and says, oh my God, your soul is Bro. Hey Bro, your solo. So you've got an umbrella like Mary poppins and she stupid. Fuck, it's got an umbrella. And what does that a microphone. Is it a microphone or a razor blade? What do you do when your kids start asking have

Speaker 3:          02:25:24       to do those on their face to anywhere they say what they want to be peers. Do they want to?

Speaker 1:          02:25:29       I th I, I have two full sleeves. Uh, I would be a massive hypocrite if I told them not to get tattoos, but I would definitely tell them, you really should think about the fact that you're going to keep the skin for your rest of your life. Like, don't, you know, if you want to get a tattoo, it should mean something. Don't get anything done that's cheap. Go real artists. Think about it. Yeah. You know? Yeah. He can't control them, I guess. No, I don't think. Not only do I think you can't control them, but I think if you try to control them, you're going to do the opposite. Nose piercing, nose piercing seems easy. He'd get it taken out. You put it back in. It's no big deal. I would rather nose piercing that forehead tattoo, but they're so beautiful and feed a loca rather than your forehead, eh?

Speaker 3:          02:26:20       Yeah. I think, uh, my younger one was like, I like a little nose. Like, well, no, it's like the little.in the nose kind of thing. I was like, I could be worse things in this life. I doesn't really make me that angry, but she's so perfect just like I get it. Oh, don't do that. People like decorating themselves though. Then we were buying something. This was when we were in New York and we're just walking around and then I was buying something in the woman at the register was tons of piercings on her nose and her ears and like, you know, like 50 on her ear. And I said, uh, I said, how did the nose one? Did you nose piercing hurt? This is right off our conversation. Oh yes. It really did hurt. It was so painful and they had to do it twice and then it got infected and it was just a terrible thing.

Speaker 3:          02:27:07       I've got staff and gang grandy. Yeah. And this isn't even my nose anymore. I'm looking at my daughter, like say, let's see what can happen. It's just like, I still want it. No, you can't stop them. People like decorate and themselves and I know it's a weird thing. I have a bad one. Not I have, I have three. I have a really bad one on my leg. What is it? It's, I'm a wizard. Is it? Yeah. You want to say it? We'll show you. This was my first tattoo. It was a guy in New Jersey. I just picked it up. The wars. He was rough. He said got a candy cane in his hand. Well it the original one on the wall. He was watering a pot plant. Hold on, let me get that. He was watering a pot plant and I was like, I can't do that. That's reckless. Hold on a second. You know what's really funny? Pull the microphone down so I can see your face here. Alright, here we go. Look at everybody.

Speaker 3:          02:28:05       You know what's really funny? Uh, so when we did the show for your buddy that helps the Congo pygmies, Justin, Justin, Justin on the back of his book. It's exactly my tattoo. His him that him hat with his beard. It all comes full circle. I showed it to him that night when we did the show. He was pretty freaked out. Yeah. He just sent me a text saying he's going to kill him. He's going to climb Mount Kilimanjaro. Oh my God. Yeah. I liked meeting that guy. That was great. That was the best part. But he's, the chest is even one of the nicest guys. Love that guy. Love that guy. But do things for him. Oh my God. He's just a, just a gem of a human being. I just wanted to hang with him all night. It was from this podcast. We've built more than 20 different wells in the Congo.

Speaker 3:          02:28:56       He's built, they built hundreds of wells there now. It's amazing just because of this podcast alone, more than 20 wells were build. They're awesome. Awesome. He's such a good guy. And just one of those people like instantly you just kind of, you could tell. Yeah, yeah. He's a saint. Yeah. Like, like legitimately like a saint. Yeah. His book is pretty great and he's a fucking cage fighter and now how does that, yeah. Yeah. So that'd be a nice guy. No, he was really cool. But I wish I had a picture of the book. It literally is my shitty tattoo is, is him. How many other ones you got? I've got two more cup. Went up here and went up here. Those are good. This was, and this was, this was like a shitty spot. Tore it too. It was kind of like a coward way on your calf.

Speaker 3:          02:29:43       It's just like there is that. Yeah, that's my tattoo. He's holding the thing. Yeah. He's got a spear that he got from the pygmies and he's wearing a hat they made out of leaves. Justin looks like my shitty tattoo. What's on your raw shoulders? Uh, my wife's name is on here and uh, over here is like the sun with this quote from Walt Whitman on it. These are the, these are the days that must happen to you from Ode to the song of the open road by Walt Whitman. These are the days that must happen. These are the days that must happen to you. You shall not, you shall not gather, uh, rich's, you'll scatter with a lavish hand. All that you earn and achieve. You shall not settle in one place, but we'll leave. Uh, but we'll leave to the silent leaders and laughing at those. You leave behind.

Speaker 3:          02:30:42       Um, basically go out. These are the days that must happen to you. Be Fearless. Go, go, just go, go be fearless. Go stay in the harbor. Don't stay in one place. Don't stay in the harbor. Go and keep touch with friends from back home. Yeah. I've got a real tight group from a grade school, high school. Did some of them not leave, not go anywhere. And you, you were around them and you just, you get to see what that's like. Um, a little bit. Yeah. It's a weird way of living. Yeah. It is a weird way of living and I get nostalgic sometimes because I see, I go back that same place,

Speaker 4:          02:31:20       you know, where I was a kid and uh, and the one hand it seems like, you know, you could have made that choice. You could stay and easy. It's just stay there and be at the same spot and do the same thing and there's something very appealing and calm about it. But it wasn't my nature. I couldn't do it.

Speaker 1:          02:31:39       Yeah. There's always something appealing about something that other people are doing though, isn't it? Yeah, for sure. You think about your own situations and the weirdness of your own existence and you go, ah, I want to be great if I just fucking cabinet maker and

Speaker 4:          02:31:52       Belgium. Yeah, exactly. He has his coffee in the morning. He just makes his cabinets, goes to the same cafe every evening and has a beer and he gets embedded nine and his, him and his dog. Perfect. Sitting at the bar. I love his cabinets. Yeah. And he's like, Oh, this is hell. I live show is kind of jokes. It happened to me around the world since I started baking this bread. When I'm on the road, I'll go see these bakers. Like if there's someone really good in a town that I'm in and just go talk to him. He's so big. He's just like, like

Speaker 1:          02:32:24       if you were a martial artist, she'd go train with them. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          02:32:27       Yeah. I go and I go and check out how they make their bread and and see what they're doing. Hey, I'm Tom Papa. A little sour dough. Yeah. Like, Hey, you know, I'll, I'll tweet out. Then I'm going to come. And then they'll, they'll bring me back and yeah, it's great. So what do, did sign the good bakers in towns or a website that you go to? No, you just like, you know, through instagram and stuff, you start to see the ones that you really like and who they follow and you just start to see like who's doing the same kind of a thing, you know, because it's a certain, it's a very natural way of doing it. So it's not like just like a big commercial bakery that's just, you know, cranking stuff out. Like there's people that are real artists that are doing this stuff all around the country, all around the world. Right. So, but it's funny because I'll come in and be like all bright eyed and this is amazing. So you're a baker and you just come in here and make this stuff and you, I mean, how great is it that you feed the community and everyone really loves what you do and you put your heart and soul into it and they look at you like, I'm up at two o'clock every day so I'm in a living hell flower.

Speaker 4:          02:33:35       I can't stay up past eight you know what I mean? It is. It's always like, it's always the other thing with seems to know what do you have to get up early, right? Yeah, man. Because you know you walk in and want a sticky bun on your way to work at seven o'clock someone was up making that at four so you can so it could be ready for you at seven there's no way around that. There's no way around that shit. Yeah. Yeah. Those bagels, someone's in there cranking than out in the middle of the night.

Speaker 1:          02:34:03       There's a good bit, there's a good, a little bakery down the street from here. In fact, I don't, I don't like to eat sweets very often, but they have these fucking chocolate croissants that is so ridiculous. The pastry part is so buttery and flaky and then the chocolate part is so rich, so good. I can't even, I can't get coffee there cause if I get coffee there, I will get one of those fucking things and I'll feel like shit. I know you'd tell it like it an hour later you're just like, what? But while you're eating and it's heaven, it's so rich chewiness to the, there's a combination of the fleeky buttery pastry in the, the richness of the chocolate and the sweetness and then you're drinking your coffee at the same time. You're like, this is perfect. I didn't, I don't need anything but this.

Speaker 1:          02:34:57       Fuck diabetes and not worry about diabetes. I wonder about life. I want to live. Yeah, that's living man. It is the good stuff. It's not, it's not bad man. It's just, it's not good for you. It's not anything in excess. Right. When I found the little treat once in a while there's a company called no foods, k, n, O, w, and they make waffles, chocolate chip waffles, and they make syrup with low glycemic index, very little sugar in the waffle variation and it tastes good. What do you mean they come like premade? Like put them in the toaster. The lead. They're frozen like an Eggo kind of a thing. Yeah, but they don't last very long, so you have to like eat them. You have to thaw them out pretty quickly. Eight grams of fiber, 12 grams of protein, four grams net carbs. Whoa. On sign for grants.

Speaker 1:          02:35:49       Right Bitch. And I'm putting butter on those motherfuckers. And then they have their own syrup, no syrup as very little as well. Uh, that looks perfect, dude. I'm telling you. They are smart people that are healthy, that figured out a way to make, look at that. Wow. I had that yesterday. Felt great, worked out afterwards. I feel like a fucking champ. Didn't feel shitty at all. Like, look at that. You felt like there's no way I can eat that. There's no way. There's no way you got to get them online or do you get them in a store? I ordered them online. Yeah. And then they, uh, they're very nice. They found out. They come and they sent me a box of shit. What a treat and that we have some of their cookies here too. He tried. We try one of their cookies before you leave.

Speaker 1:          02:36:30       Tom. Papa needs some of those. Yeah, man. There's some stuff that you can eat that people have figured out how to do. Ozone stores, places where they sound. Oh Wow. There's a bunch of places where people have figured out how to make food that tastes really good. That doesn't fuck you up. Yes, of course. Be Honest. Let's be on the United States of America. Let's be honest. Yes. It doesn't taste as good as that chocolate croissant. Well, no, it just doesn't. Well, no damn good. But you can have that damn go four times a week probably. Yeah. You could have it every day, but there's something about knowing that you're eating shit and you're like, I don't care. Now this is part of it. It's part of the part of the thrill. Thrill and joy during the holidays. Oh yeah. When we had Christmas cookies on the counter for like two straight weeks, just walking through eating.

Speaker 2:          02:37:16       I'm like chips. Like I don't care. It's Christmas cookie time. That's heaven. You know what I have the other night. It's a good time. Pumpkin Pie with cool whip Pumpkin Pie. No one's even pretending cool webs good for no. No one even knows what the fuck. Cool. We're pretending it's a food. It's just like some weird fucking thick stuff that's white. Yeah. Oh, that's good. Where'd the Pumpkin Pie come from? I don't even know. I didn't even ask. It was my mother in Law's house. Oh Man. I didn't ask a goddamn question. That's wolf. That fucker down. Something about warm Pumpkin Pie too. I'm like, God, it's so good. Pumpkin pies. So I fasted yesterday. I didn't eat anything really. The whole day. Yeah, I had a lot of Broccoli. I had some water. Coffee, coffee. Yeah. I had probably four cups of coffee and uh, I didn't feel bad. I didn't, I felt pretty good when I woke up this morning.

Speaker 2:          02:38:14       I was starving. Yeah, but once your body, if you can figure out how to do it for 45 hours, 48 hours, your body will kick into a state of burning fat body of, we will kick in. No state of Ketosis. 48 hours straight. Yes. It depends on the person. Some people, it's quicker depending on if you're fat adapted. If it's even quicker than that, but I know when I'm in that state because my appetite kind of goes away. Yeah. That's what, it was weird. I was like, why aren't I starving right now? Yeah. Well that's one good thing about when I was sick. Last few days. I hardly at anything really sucks. Succeed. Also can look myself in the mirror. I'm like snot coming down but looking ripped me. I'm gone. My cheeks are sucked in. My eyeballs are dark.

I can't get a good selfie for like life. Depends on it. Okay. This tilt your head forward to look up a bit to look sharp and slimmer. That's true. I want to look sharp, dude. How about sharp? Ooh, that's good to look sharp. How about this? Now just show me your at the same time and you got something like Yoga. Yeah, right. Okay. Don't slouch and sit but create angles. You're sitting down. Goals, goals. Let's look at that girl's back like how is she even doing that? It's all about just like the extra cyst podcast.

Speaker 2:          02:42:35       I should have been doing this during the podcast the whole time. What's the next one? Don't sprawl your legs while sitting on the ground. Oh, see, so she touches the knees together. Don't sprawl. Don't sprawl your legs. Um, listen honey, don't mask whatever. While we're trying to take a picture, I'll go back to that. We didn't say that girl is beautiful. She can do whatever the fuck she wants with her legs. No one's going to complain. She could have them legs like fully spread wide and people like, ah, hey, you want to get some coffee or something? And we want to do, do you want to take over my company? Lower your forehead a bit. Well make up your mind. Lean forward. Hello. Are you with our head for it then? I'm not leaning forward anymore. Oh right. Hook up a little to make your eyes look even bigger and more expressive. Oh, okay. No, that girl's hot as fuck.

Speaker 2:          02:43:25       That girl. Look hot no matter what she did. Yeah, just be hotter. Yeah, be hotter. Oh, just put weight on the back leg while posing and hence, oh and hence creating an angular pose and hence that, that girls like, but she looks like she's saying, what the fuck did you ask me to do? Okay. What, what did you that is not part of my job description. That is not what I was hired for and I'm barefoot for fucking some strange reason. I'm barefoot and angry looking. What did you say? White man, mother fucker. I was reading a thing yesterday that had sleep patterns of successful people.

Speaker 2:          02:44:08       Um, Richard Branson, Bill Gates, people like that, right? Obama, most of them six hours of sleep at night? Yeah, most between like the 12 one o'clock to like six, seven o'clock in the morning. I think there's a balance between productivity and health and if you want to get more done, I would say that's probably the way to go. But I don't think those people were pillars of health for fitness and exercise is really hard and you know, and really tax your body. You need more. I think you need eight. You need eight. I do eight. You do eight? I feel way better when I get eight. He has six is six does not seem like a lot cause this all the different people. Nikola Tesla got to, yeah, but he's too busy. Bang and pigeons. He's crazy. He was banging super, super genius. Who was in love with a pigeon? What? Yeah. I never heard that. He had a love affair with the pigeon. Winston Churchill got like a hundred hours of sleep at night. Da Vinci and he was just drunk all the time. Are those, are those dots mean hours? It's when they slept, he slept every four hours, like a 20 minute nap. Who did something similar to that then? She did that. Yeah. That's what those little blue lines are when they were sleeping. That's crazy. And Winston Churchill just slept like a bear because he was drunk.

Speaker 2:          02:45:25       He drank like crazy. Richard Branson seems like he's getting, let's say six. Yeah, 12 to six that sounds kind of reasonable. That's reasonable. But six is early to get up for me while if he's one of those gets shit done. Donald Trump, three hours, one to four, one to four come on. That's not real be true. Is that real based on speed one, you know, that was the speculation about trump, um, from uh, an article that was posted a while back was that he had a prescription for amphetamines and like the 90s, and someone had prescribed him, see what you could find that um, trump prescribed speed for diet and he stayed

Speaker 1:          02:46:10       on it for like eight years. Really? Yeah. It's been my understanding when you talk to people that love adderall and, and those sorts of things, that you become incredibly productive when you're on that stuff. And if you're one of those people that gets used to being incredibly productive and stuff like eliminating that, it's very hard. See, 1993, Harry hunts unauthorized biography on trump. Last tycoon corroborated the rumors and went one step further. The Diet drugs with trump took in pill form, not only curbed his appetite, but gave him a feeling of euphoria and unlimited energy. The Medical Literature, Warren, that some potentially dangerous side effect could result from long term usage. They included anxiety, insomnia, and delusions of grand jury. What?

Speaker 1:          02:46:59       According to several trump organization insiders, donald exhibited all these ominous symptoms of Diet, drug use, and then some the supposed drug trump took back then was tenuous. Dos Pan a drug with speed like effects. It's not unlike dexedrine. These rumors say trump stopped seeing doctor Greenberg decades ago, but according to one source to our source, the Donald Trump of today is on a diet drug called fen term mean and has been since at least April of 2014 he does not look like he's on a diet. Phen phen phen phen phen to mean first gain, no tr notoriety us under the name phen phen a miracle combination of phentermine and fenfluramine another established anti obesity drugs. The only problem was that patients taking the drug, b camera b began reporting damage to their hearts and lungs. Apparently the combination destroyed patients body's ability to regulate the amount of Serotonin phentermine on its own.

Speaker 1:          02:48:05       However, it's still prescribed and while the US National Library of medicine notes that most people take phentermine for a month or so at a time since the drug is addictive, trump has supposedly been taking continuously for over two years. Well listen, when people get used to taking pills and speed in particular, they get used to that ramped up life. They can't, they can't. It's very hard. It's just very hard to just go cold Turkey and be that guy who just dull now. Yeah. Right. Exactly. From Superhero he had while he was on the campaign trail, like constantly speaking against and could never shut the fuck up. It was really impressive. I mean it was nonstop. Right? 72 year old man. 73 but it doesn't it make sense. Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. Hillary was fall. Oh very nice. I knew hillary was talking stuff too. She was on a pro vigil. What's that? Pro Vigil is a drug that was first invented. They were trying to make a drug that was actually

Speaker 2:          02:49:08       a performance enhancing drug and then they had to come up with a reason for taking it, cause he can't just say, hey, we made a pharmaceutical drug that enhances your, uh, your, your energy levels. So they came up with narcolepsy. Oh yeah, I've taken it. Oh yeah. Yeah. It's great if you have to drive somewhere and you're tired because it doesn't give you, it doesn't make you speedy. And I don't think it makes you any smarter or faster thinking or anything like that. But it definitely keeps you awake. It gives you like a little elevated sense of energy. Yeah. It doesn't sound so bad, but yeah. I mean you'd have to take something to keep up those. I mean, you know, just touring and stuff, what that takes out of you and watch the, how they just were nonstop and he was probably on diet pills.

Speaker 2:          02:49:49       Interesting. And then get skinnier. I knew a gal got on that phen phen stuff. Oh yeah, yeah. Back in the 90s she was beautiful, but she was Chubby. She just had a bad diet. And you know, just like the booze and she's probably 20 something or something right now. And uh, got on the fen phen and I hadn't seen her in forever. I haven't seen her in probably like a year. And then I ran into her and I was like, Holy Shit. Like what happened? And you lost balls. And she was like 120 pounds and slim and gorgeous. And I was like, that is crazy. So what did, yeah, but that it's our fucking weather and like messing her body up and you know, like, like heart palpitations and shit and then, you know, a year later she was bigger than ever. She's, well, I mean if you think about like taking an Ibuprofen, if like, if that messes you up, these drugs, the impact is huge. Oh yeah, man. Well I know so many people that are on adderall. Yeah, I was just going to say, have you ever tried to enter wrong? Never meet me there to have it, but I want to, I know, me too. I want to try it. Jamie's going to bring in something from me. You take it, a dealer may or may not sell it to children. Know what God pill from a friend of mine that I wanted, I never even used it. Oh. And I still just have it.

Speaker 4:          02:51:04       Yeah. Now all this stuff really works. You ever, you ever take a um, ambien? No, I sleep easy. I do too. I got no problem sleep. I was doing a show in the Middle East one so my doctor gave me Ambien. He's like, if he need help with Justin your time. I didn't ask for it. He just gave it to me and uh, I don't really take anything really, but I took it. It was, I mean it just works. You just like pretty awake and then you just feel sleep just kind of coming over you like, like an ocean wave and it,

Speaker 2:          02:51:38       I mean do you feel when you woke up? Not Good. A little druggy. Yeah. Fucked up. Yeah. It wasn't like I woke up like, oh I'm good to go be kind of tired and then just go to the gym. Yes, exactly. I'm just not into that drugged up feeling now. It's all cause they need, then it becomes a whole cat and mouse trying to adjust it. And I had a buddy who was going, I had a buddy who's going through a divorce and couldn't sleep at all. So he was taking two of those fucking things at night and everybody was urging them. They were like, man, don't take that much. Yeah, I think this is, this stuff is not good for you.

Speaker 3:          02:52:09       I'm always afraid you won't be able to. Yeah. You're not gonna be able to sleep normally

Speaker 2:          02:52:13       or you don't wake up. Yeah. Oh yeah. Yeah. Take it and night-night choking middle of the night and just had cheese. You're in the middle. Some crazy dream about being in a gunfight with the cops. That's the thing about barrel ambien. People do things and they're asleep. Yeah. Got Buy ice cream. I had a bit about it in my act about a friend of mine who made a Turkey. He got up in the middle of the night, preheated the oven, went to the store, bought a Turkey, came home, made stuffing, mashed potatoes and gravy, cooked it, ate it, went back to sleep. Got Up in the morning and call the police. Someone broke into her house and made a Turkey. They're like, what the fuck is wrong with you? You fat piece of Shit.

Speaker 3:          02:53:04       They come to grips with your food problem. It's a real story. It's a real story. He didn't remember doing any of it. No. He made a Turkey. Went to the store, dude. Yeah, like bought a Turkey, dealt with someone at the register, bought a fucking Turkey, drove his car. Oh my God. That's so crazy. Yeah. People are weird, man. I'm surprised. No one's like killed someone. All they have, they have.

Speaker 2:          02:53:29       Yeah. Yeah. People have. Yeah. People have murdered people on it and there was one guy that's Jesus. He, I want to say he killed someone in his family with a crowbar. Oh boy. It was like some crazy story where he was on Ambien and he drove to someone's house and killed him with a crowbar and then drove home. We had no idea even did it. Oh my God. Well, people react to different things in different ways. You can never predict exactly how someone's going to react to like heavy duty pharmaceutic.

Speaker 3:          02:54:00       That's what I was worried about. I'm like, I'm not taking this on the flight. Who knows what I'm going to do? Recount all of the fucking ocean. How high up? I just wake up in prison. You don't know why did I get here? You know what you did? Don't haven't watched the video of, you kind of have some businessman

Speaker 2:          02:54:22       cat in the hat hat on, beating someone to death with a nine iron,

Speaker 3:          02:54:29       mixing the drink cart. Go and try and get at the pilot. Yeah. Oh my God. Does having the fly hood a nightmare and hasn't been around that long, right? Like this is 2013 I suppose. Just trying to look up. There's something called the sleep homicidal sleepwalking defense that's been used

Speaker 2:          02:54:50       at least since 1987 she's like, it goes back farther than that and here's the wikipedia on it. Wow. Sleepwalking defense. Wow. Homicidal some, some NAM bullism, but on an or sleep walking sleepwalking murderer. The act of killing someone during an episode of sleepwalking. Oh Man. See, that's the thing. Like if you're going to kill somebody, wouldn't even be like even sleep. But he was acquitted of killing the murder of his mother in, in 1987 after using the sleep, walked in defense. So let me just pause right there. I would love to believe this man. However, I have a wonderful mother in law. She's a lovely lady, but I have friends whose mother-in-law's or straight cons. It's a real thing. It's a real thing and it just so convey at this guy, he didn't kill his children. You know, he didn't know his wife drive to his buddy's house and kills best friend.

Speaker 2:          02:55:50       What does it say there reportedly got up from his bed, still asleep and drove roughly 23 kilometers to his in laws house, broken, assaulted his father in law, Denis would, and stabbed his mother-in-law to death. Wow. Wow. Good on you for all this. He managed to drive himself to the police station side from a few isolated events and next thing he could recall was being in the police station asking for help, saying, I think I've killed some people. My hands. Whoa. Wow. Well, that's what I would do too. If was going to go, pretend you've got to plan this out. Something a blew up for you. I don't know what it was crazy, but you guys gotta help me. Yeah. Like if you know for sure you're going to kill them. Like there's no way I can not kill this person. I need a fucking rock solid excuse. Yeah. What does this non Bellambi Elysium but I'm and, and then he had a wonderful thanksgiving. So ever since that Oh man. Stay married after that. How's that work? Yeah. Probably maybe invite you probably quietly is grateful. Yeah. The Dad pulls you aside and slips your 20s than me. Butter, which some people do have weird sleepwalking things though. Sleep while I did as a kid. Did you

Speaker 3:          02:57:09       [inaudible] like around kindergarten? I would, uh, I would come out into like the living room, just screaming and crying. Woe

Speaker 2:          02:57:19       and not have any recollection?

Speaker 3:          02:57:20       No, none. I did have recurring nightmares that I remember the one very clear one was um, it was a blackness, you know, sometimes when you're sleeping and then you can feel the, the black, this,

Speaker 2:          02:57:36       the space was just very big and you felt very small in it. And uh, there would be rumbling real mum, mum, mum, mum, mum, mum, mum, mum, mum, mum, mum, mum. And it would build on the momentum recording, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum bum.

Speaker 3:          02:57:53       And uh, and I would feel kind of pulled back a little bit and it got a silent okay.

Speaker 4:          02:58:02       And uh, and then the terrorists have two tanks would slowly come into the periphery on the left and the right of a mum, mum, mum, mum, mum, the, and you see like the governor of the tank and the tanks would slowly start going towards each other from the left and the right. And then they would fall down this hole and you'd get that feeling of falling. And then sometimes I'd see the face of it.

Speaker 2:          02:58:30       My father, sometimes I have dreams of falling off of things. Yeah. What's that supposed to mean? That means that you're going to get money. Powerful. Is that good? Sometimes I do though. Sometimes I have dreams where I'm like catching myself like I'm on a tree. This tree, hang on. Yeah. What am I doing on the edge of this building? What am I doing on that cliff? You get back to the same spot. Get back to the same spot.

Speaker 4:          02:59:03       So I wouldn't connect the dream to the sleep walking, but what do you think it is? I mean, I don't know. It could have been connected. Dude, you're a doctor. Is that, I remember one time I was at my friends sleeping over my friend's house and the next morning they were like, Tommy can't sleep here anymore because I did it at their house where they just asleep and then you got some kids screaming in the middle of screaming in the middle of then crying and screaming in the middle of the living room.

Speaker 2:          02:59:27       I've had kids do that at my house. You have? Yeah. You pick them up being, are you okay? Yeah, we'll let him to the bed. You know? It's the one kids too, man. It's so hard. People don't have kids to understand this. But like, yeah, it's when I, I'm sorry this before, but when I was on planes before I would be bummed out if a kid was crying was fucking great. There's a lot of fun fucking loud, stupid kid. Quiet your kid up. Yup. But now I'm like, aww, poor little kid. Yeah. Like it doesn't it that you don't even hear it, but it doesn't bother me. No. Like I'm upset, I can't sleep. It's like a little kid. Yeah. Once you hit so different, once you have it

Speaker 4:          03:00:10       hopefully and the parents, you, you, you, uh, I have empathy for the parents. Like you're like, oh, I've been there when you're going through that thing is just so rough and it, but it really is an instinct. Like there is, there is no, like when you hear a baby crying and plain, there's not that thing. When you had, when you were younger, this is just like get it Outta here.

Speaker 2:          03:00:28       Yeah. That's a weird thing that people do have. Like, I've seen it before were like young boys in particular do not like babies. No, they don't like kids. And they're around. I'm like, Oh yeah. They'll roll their eyes and it's like to them instinct. Yeah. And then once you have them, you would just like, but it's funny when you see like teenage boys around them, especially ones that haven't been raised around kids. Maybe it's the instinct that they're going to have to, uh, one day take care of one of those. Yeah. Yeah. And the party is going to end. They're going to track, be trapped. The part is going

Speaker 1:          03:00:59       to end in a, it's funny because like there are these chapters, it's like this is all coming full circle to what we're talking about with like Richard Branson on a boat, getting his dick sucked, doing coke. But, but here's the thing, there's a cycle. And if you hang in there long enough becomes cool again. Like if you're hammered and you're 20 and you're out there, how it a party, it's kind of silly and it's fun. But if you're hammered and you're 60, it's kind of sad. Yeah. But if you're hammered and your 90 it's funny again. Yeah, absolutely. It's kind of, Hey, you're a 90 year old drunk. I goddamn about you all just suck my Dick, which by the way, apparently the latest in the sexual harassment Olympics, the latest a entry is Stan Lee from marvel comics. Really? Yeah. He's 95 years old. Yeah. He lives in some giant mansion and he has a bunch of nurses and he's trying to get them all the blown.

Speaker 1:          03:01:58       Of course now he says it's a shake down. He says they're all, they're all just trying to get money from him. Uh, may very well be the case. She or it may well very well be the case that he is like a lot of 95 year old dudes with 20 million bucks in the bank and about six months to live. Just getting it on. Lydia, do you try? You'd go for it. He swing those fucking dice. Come on. Seven Stanley, if he really can, if you know what I mean. If you're worth what, hold on, go back to that. What does it say now? He, okay. He bought someone. Then it was revealed that someone had bought an $850,000 condo in his name without his knowledge. And that was last week. I don't know if you're at oh no. What happened? Follow police report after discovering that someone had stolen $300,000 from him.

Speaker 1:          03:02:49       Well, using a forged check and then it was a reveal that someone bought an $850,000 condo in his name without his knowledge of fact. It came to light when his team did a full audit of his accounts following the forged check. Whether this is any way related. Okay. So he might be being honest. This might be in reaction to shake down the shakedown, but this guy has so much money that someone bought an $850,000 condo in his name and he didn't learn about it until they were going over the books. Well, he didn't. Yeah. He didn't learn about it until they found a $300,000 stolen cheque. Yeah, that's a baller. Yeah. Stanley, you all went out of control. Hero out that kicked fucking ass superhero. Yeah. I'd like to think that he's not the guy who's trying to tell these maids to suck his dick. Naw, I doubt it. I like to think that. Me Too. I want some heroes left. A couple of those guys, but hang in there guys. One more time.

Speaker 2:          03:04:01       Let's wrap this bitch up. What's bringing home? Tell these people where you're going to be performing your wonderful standup comedy. I'm heading out on tour.
