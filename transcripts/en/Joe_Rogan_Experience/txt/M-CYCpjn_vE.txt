Speaker 1:          00:02:29       Gentlemen tardy, but here nonetheless, sort of, it's like halfway through because the uh, the one on Ustream says 3:00 and this one says a and I said at 2:00 because I'm an Indian, but it's supposed to be 3:00, so we figured we'll start somewhere around. Now it's all about checking out the twitter that I to find out when really going on. Well, that's ridiculous Brian, because some people have lives and they can't just be on the fucking twitter all the time looking for you.

Speaker 2:          00:02:56       Shit. Have you met people that have their twitter setup? So when twit they

Speaker 1:          00:03:00       automatically get like a text message. I don't know. People get mad at me sometimes you may, you're tweet too much, man. It's blowing up my phone to take you off. That's ridiculous. Why would you have. I think maybe in the beginning it was almost like an instant message for people, you know, but it really, that's just text messaging. That's someone who, you know, text messaging but text messaging to all their friends. Right? And then it got crazy, you know, it's a strange way of communicating. Now, twitter is one of the weirdest fucking interventions that the Internet has ever spurland sparring. Spring gives birth to shit out. It's amazing. It's just, it's so simple. Keep it to 140 characters so that, uh, you know, you don't get to fucking verbose stupid. You learn how to edit your shit, you know, you can't have these long run on.

Speaker 1:          00:03:52       You ever read someone's blogs? And even my own blogs ramble so much, too much sometimes. But some people, your blogs are for smart people that you know, like, like readers, like I have to be in a reader mode most of the time I'm in more of a video to bullshit. I don't want to read anything like that. I write, but, but uh, it, it's. Sometimes I do, I times I think when I have what I want to write it, I have to write it. Whatever the, if I'm writing something, it's just because that's what I'm thinking about and I've been fucking with it and I've been rolling around in my head, you know, and they might not be correct. I have no idea. Most of them, most of my ideas are just pure speculation, but the only way to really be honest about it, so write in a blog. You can't like tell people stuff like that.

Speaker 1:          00:04:39       You start talking to people about your theories and you suddenly got nut least if you write it down for whatever reason, it looks more thought out. Isn't that weird? You know, have you just tell people that you think that technology, some sort of a symbiotic life form that's existing with us and eventually it's going to overcome us and then everybody's looking at it like we control it always, you know? No, no, like those terminator movies, those guys got it right. Like, that's like super possible. It really is. I mean, no one wants to believe that, but if you look at how fucking chaotic human life is and not, not really in America, you know, this is pretty bad ass country, but if you watch like documentaries on like that vice squad guide to Liberia, is that what it was? What is the, the website? Did we talk about that last week?

Speaker 1:          00:05:30       Uh, W, W, what was it about those vice tv guys, those guys that go to Liberia and talk about all the cannibalism and shit that's going on? It seems like you did. We did talk about it. If you haven't seen it. Well, I'm going to find the link and throw it up anyway because it's so crazy. There's that link also that you talked about last week that somebody said that you didn't. Did you ever. They were like, this links not working. A lot of people are saying a, I forget what it was about maybe the lions that you were talking about the lions last last week that, that,

Speaker 3:          00:05:58       uh, the amped up. Oh yeah. Really that was the wrong. Maybe it was that one. There was a few, there was. I just remember because somebody said that they saw it. It was amazing. Maybe they googled it or something. Maybe. Maybe they were smart. They were like, oh, maybe we should use google talking about something or I'll give you the wrong way. Just let me know. I'm sorry that that is annoying when you're trying to figure out what it is. But most of the time Google works out pretty well. Don't you feel like a little genius when you figure out where they fucked up though, you go back to the url and you go, oh, there's the bottom part of it. You've got to copy and paste the whole thing they put in your browser. It's like, solves a little bit,

Speaker 4:          00:06:32       a little puzzle. That's awkward. That's a Papaya. Kombucha. Shit's good for you. Or is it mango? Papaya. Cuban. A male. Um, well it's up to other people. The flux Kragen how's life? It's like that lion shit was crazy. Yeah. If you haven't seen what we're talking about with the Lions Shit, there was a, these gigantic lions that lived in Africa and they got cut off from the rest of the continent and there was a, there was stuck on an island and they were like regular size lines at first they presume and because they were on the island with only water, buffalo water buffalo, hardest to kill. So these lions got gigantic. They grew fucking huge from taking down water buffaloes. It's really pretty fucking spooky stuff. You know, it's intense. Like they looked like the hulk, they didn't look real like, yeah, those mice that have that milestone and thing that they like. Those dogs was whippets. When they do those experiments on them and make them look like cartoons

Speaker 3:          00:07:32       you ever seen that? That disease, I guess it would be that makes you grow fast. Like they just showed this a woman that was 12 years old, but she looked like she was 62 and a smoker.

Speaker 4:          00:07:44       It has to do with the fat and your skin. It doesn't have to do with growing fast and it has to do with the fat in your skin. When you get older, one of the things that happens is the fat leaves your skin and these people who are like 13 and 12 and we're little babies even they have this disease where that's how their body like starts treating it right away so their skin starts to behave like an old person's skin. Oh yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:08:09       It was weird though. I felt so bad for her because she was really. Her mother had it too. It's terrible. Super rare though, so don't worry about. It's. Yeah, but it's pretty free

Speaker 4:          00:08:19       when you find diseases like that, you know, but this Liberia Shit, man, if you haven't seen this, I have to throw this link up because it's one of the gnarliest fucking documentaries I've ever seen ever. And these guys, I think this show's called vice guide TV vice guide to Liberia. I'm going to give you exactly

Speaker 3:          00:08:40       the last, last night. Yes I did without giving any spoilers. What do you think?

Speaker 4:          00:08:46       No spoilers, no spoilers. I think uh, I'm getting tired of it.

Speaker 3:          00:08:51       You are. So you didn't find it exciting. It was exciting, but I like, come on,

Speaker 4:          00:08:56       you're just jumping back in time and you know, people are dead but then they're not and like come on really. You know what I'm saying? It's like, really? That's what's going on now.

Speaker 3:          00:09:05       Well, when that one thing with the one thing and he was like, I'm sorry for being that thing. It was crazy. Yeah, it was like a certain point in time. I was like, God damn, this is like comical. Yeah, it was a caricature. You know what I really hated also how many commercials they're worried. There were like every three minutes. There was a commercial in the future. Hopefully you could like go. All right. No, I don't want commercials. I want pop up ads on my tv, you know, pretty pretty nutty because that was just like you were into it, out of it, into it, out of it.

Speaker 4:          00:09:32       Yeah. It is pretty naughty. It's, you've got to watch it on Dvr and even then you've got to fast forward through commercials are a very inefficient way of reaching people because you're annoying the shit out of him, you know? I mean it does have you stuff enough shit down. Our throats will eventually take it. But putting it out in the middle of like shows and stuff like that.

Speaker 3:          00:09:54       What if you could go to like a group once a month for like 10 minutes and they showed you a bunch of products and then they're like, all right, no more advertising for you on the internet or for the TV. Just because you, you know, you went to like a group meeting just so advertisers can sell their products to you in person. You know what I mean? Like this is coke here. Taste tasted. Yeah. Alright. So we won't advertise on TV anymore.

Speaker 4:          00:10:16       Well I think there's maybe a better way would be to do it the way they do it in the movies where they show you the ads first. Yeah. And then the movie. Yeah. But you have to watch it. That's the thing now. But still, it's like once the show begins, you shut the fuck up. You know when you go to the movies, the conceded, the you're conceding is it? You give them money so they're only going to know you in the beginning and then they're gonna stop annoying you. They're going to let the thing play out in its full form, which is the most enjoyable way when you appreciate any like a coca cola or any one of those people just stepped in and said, listen, we all know the TV shows are better when you let them play from the beginning to end. You don't want to interrupt him with commercial all the time. How about we'll do this. We'll advertise in the beginning. Thank you very much. I hope you enjoy our product. Hope you enjoy this movie. Bam. Yeah. That's how it's supposed to be. They've got it nailed. These movie guys. Got It. Nailed. These TV guys are retarded. It'd be putting shit on the middle of the fucking show. Stupid.

Speaker 3:          00:11:12       It was. Yeah, and it was so bad last night that I was just like, really? This is getting an insane 15 minutes. Come on. It wasn't even 20 minutes. Maybe. Maybe every hour. If you have a two hour show every hour. Trolling a few commercials. Fuck it. It pretty much was one hour show, one hour of commercials, but they built it as a two hour event.

Speaker 4:          00:11:32       Yeah. Well it's a lot of money, man. There's a lot of money. I wasn't. I really enjoyed the series up until now, but especially early on. I'm a fellow is. It's like a really creative series, but I got to admit that last night just seemed kind of like hokey. It's like, you know, the Chinese guy who doesn't like to a, I don't want to say anything right now. Yeah, you

Speaker 3:          00:11:54       gotta just go replace everything that blah blah blah, blah.

Speaker 4:          00:11:56       I'm not. No, no spoilers. I don't want to give it away if you haven't seen it. So, uh, that's what I think it's a, it's still a great show still, even though it seems Hokey, it's still fun, but at a certain point in time, the whole premise is hokey. I mean, come on. It's silly. It's ridiculous. It's the suspension of disbelief show. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:12:14       Now when you jumping back in time with nuclear weapons, like, what the fuck are you doing? You know what? You can just hit that thing and you go back.

Speaker 4:          00:12:21       Oh, okay, cool. No, it's just utter nonsense.

Speaker 3:          00:12:25       It's like I want to talk about it, but there's something I want to talk about it, but I'm trying to censor it, but I. There's no way to do it. Yeah. You can't eat snacks. Well, how did you, did you enjoy it? Yeah, I did. I was so pissed off about the commercials that kind of upset me very upset. I, I like being in a rural road and imagine watching Avatar and every five minutes you got to take commercial. No, you're absolutely right. It's ridiculous. There's got to be a better way to sell shit. That's not the best way to sell shit. That's stupid. If they think that just by, you know, by conditioning people to be used to, you know, interrupting and over and over again that that's the best way. Make us watch it in the beginning they're like, well, we're not gonna. Watch it anyway. Then you have a Webcam set up on top of your TV that detects if you're sitting there watching it. You know, people get excited for previews. Man. I get excited for the whole preview. I don't know why, but I get excited. I'm more amped up to see the wolf man this year. Then I think like anything, man, that looks awesome. Can you do it? That's going to be like in a gang sign, dude, do the wolf man.

Speaker 4:          00:13:25       It looks sick. It looks cool because it's like old school. The wolf man, you know, and Rick Baker did all the makeup. He's that dude who did star wars and he's done like everything. He did an American Werewolf in London and this is like real old school makeup, you know, it's not like Cgi, like parts or CGI, like the transformation that CGI when it becomes the wolf man, but then it's like a dude in an outfit, you know, and Rick Baker's the master. That shit. When I was a little kid I used to want to be a makeup artist,

Speaker 3:          00:13:57       Hollywood guys that made the makeup of the guy on the hog video up there.

Speaker 4:          00:14:05       But I used to want to do like werewolf masks and Shit and like special effects movie, special effects, mass stuff. I thought that was the coolest shit ever. I wanted to do that for a while, man. I was a big fan of that guy. Rick Baker. He's the dude. He's doing this movie too. So that's what was going to be the shit.

Speaker 3:          00:14:21       It looks good. Fucking del Toro's probably a part where he sings like a wolf man song or something like that.

Speaker 4:          00:14:31       This fucking ass off that dude. You know, he's one of those dudes white when when he's playing like angry or crazy, like he goes so far you would worry that he's going to like, you've worried he's going to do something fucking crazy, you know? Then when he's in a role, he, he, he's one of those dudes. It's like I always look forward to his movies, like whatever is he knows how to

Speaker 1:          00:14:51       do it. Acting such a tricky thing, isn't it? Like some actors, you look really look forward to seeing them in movies, you know? Yeah, definitely. It's a weird thing now. Sissy spacer. Some dudes get like super obsessed with it. How about those guys guys? We're like super obsessed with movies, movie trivia and Shit.

Speaker 3:          00:15:13       You know what's really gay? Is that gross is that there's a John Travolta movie that's coming out where it's a love story and it uses a cross movie reference. That's how bad it is. He's like embarrassing goes. I always like a royale with cheese and I'm like, oh no. Oh my God. It was like John Travolta seems to be losing his mind. I would love to talk to that. How dare he ruined a character. You didn't. And you know what I mean. He's ruined and then he's creating a new one. I don't think he's ruining it. You can't ruin it. What it is is a slice of time. Now you go back and you could see it not as gross as commercials to me.

Speaker 1:          00:15:48       Well, he was good in that Pelham one, two, three movie. If you didn't see that pal. Who moving here was fucking good in it, man. He plays a good psycho

Speaker 3:          00:15:55       tape. I didn't like. Is the hurt locker? Have you seen that? I didn't see it. Rent it on Amazon. Already have it. Oh, you got it. Everybody says it's the best movie ever. It's so slow and boring. It's like, let's go to one mission anymore. I don't know. This is running. Nothing. Go to one mission to another mission. Oh, let's go to another mission. That end. It's like, why am I watching this? Like I felt like I was just

Speaker 1:          00:16:19       watching. You know what? I felt like that with no country for old men. Yeah. I never saw that. No country for old men. I was like, listen, I know what you're trying to do. I know you're trying to be crafty and I ain't trying to be unconventional, but here's the deal. When I go to movies, I want you to stick with the fucking framework. Okay? Here's good guys and bad guys and maybe monsters. Okay? And at the end. Good guys, win any questions? Okay. Make your shit okay. I like watching good guys. When you fucking Weirdo. I don't watch. I don't like watching people just drive off. The whole thing is fake. All right. Are you pretending that? Well, in the real world, things don't turn out well. This isn't the real world stupid. This is a God damn fucking movie and I want a good ending. Right? I want an interesting ending with a fucking cunt

Speaker 3:          00:17:02       avatar. Avatar. I, I've talked to so many people that have been in the military that are pissed off at that movie for killing what they say represents US soldiers, but yet nowhere in there did they say they're like us or anything. They're just like an army, you know? That's a good point really, when you think about it, like, well, they're saying who are whatever that the, the one guy was a marine, but he was one of the blue guy. I can see it, I can see it, but it's like, all right dude, calm down. There's Smurfs, you know? Well that's this. He's got a point, man. You could see it that way because you're not a a military. Right. That's what I'm saying. Especially a military person in the middle of two wars that they mean not support and there's a lot of people that are, that are in the military that don't think we should be there anymore. A lot of people. Yeah, but I think Avatar in general is just like, it was like Joe wasn't real us army troops, you know, there's no reason to get mad that they're just an army. They're representing like a space army or something. It was so much in the future. It was like a thousand year old man. It was to human life. If you want to be real to me, don't get mad at Predator. Could you imagine though, for Real, if if

Speaker 4:          00:18:12       was such a planet and there was such a mineral and there were mercenaries who were going to that planet if it wasn't broadcast to us, we don't know what the fuck is going on in Afghanistan every day. We don't know about these crazy drones and they're firing missiles into Pakistan. I mean this is real stuff that's on the news. It seems like science fiction, this is going on every day and other parts of the world and how ain't that much different men and ate that much different. It's people that don't know people and people for their shit, you know, and that's what's going on right now and that's what it was going on in the movie. It's not that unrealistic, you know? And in fact it might be, it might be generous. The idea that they would go so far as to make artificial ones, to try to be friends with them really, but more like kill them more like kill them. I mean that's what people do mean. That movie painted a much more, a much brighter picture of humanity than the real humanity. The real humanity, we're not making like Arab clones and we're operating with remote control to go in and infiltrate the Taliban and go, hey guys, what's wrong with being American? We could, maybe we can all be cool. You know,

Speaker 3:          00:19:22       you know, I mean if the United States government

Speaker 4:          00:19:24       had that kind of insight and innovation into the human body, could you imagine that kind of shit that they would do? They would just make billions and billions of Republicans that would just start cloning Republicans and making them and operating them with a remote control republican girls fucking all the important guys getting all their deals past just. They'll do.

Speaker 3:          00:19:48       You're just shaking your robot girl.

Speaker 4:          00:19:52       That's, that's an Avatar for the real life if that. If they. We don't, we're not that Nice, okay, we're not going to make fake Arabs were. No, that's not gonna happen or fake whoever the fuck we're fighting. We're going to figure out a reason to convince everybody on this side that those people are evil and that's what we've always done. Those people are evil and then we jack them. You know? I mean, it's, it's fucking amazing that the same game can go on for so long and in this age of information it can still be passed off as like, you know, as the important thing to do. You know, the important thing to do at a certain point is to try to fucking help everybody try to get all these countries to chill the fuck out. But that's never gonna happen man, because they live in somewhere that sucks.

Speaker 4:          00:20:41       And when you live somewhere that really sucks. There's a lot of Goddamn conflict, you know, that's just a fact. They got a fucking roll the dice and they're living in a part of the world that stuck hundreds and hundreds of years ago. They've got technology but they've got chaos and you know, it doesn't, it's just a mess. They've been fighting forever. They've been fighting forever over there, man. I mean that's what they do. That's what these fucking people do in the Middle East. War has been going on in the Middle East for so long. Like you talked to Israelis, like due to a live in Israel already talks about all the time. Those motherfuckers are hard, you know, those people are different, you know, those, those people were experiencing war on a, on a daily basis. Man, that's like a part of their culture almost, you know, it's like this conflict has been going on for so fucking long over there and it's almost impossible to see a way without evolving, without evolving as a species.

Speaker 4:          00:21:39       It's almost impossible to see a way it's going to end. It just keeps going. It doesn't show any sign of letting up. You know, if you looked at it as a, you know, as a wave, you know, and you see the wave bouncing back and forth. Like what? It doesn't seem like it's gone away. It seems like there's always some bullshit going down. There's always this motherfuckers mad at that motherfucker and he's gonna launch bombs and dented the. It just, it, it seems like it takes a little time off and then it bounces right back in. Palestine wants their land back and tipped it to an, a settler as an oh shit. Someone got run over by a tank to to, to, to, you know, it's like, it's always there this spring backing forth. Violent tension is always there and it's like something's gotta be done at the core of that shit. Something's gotta be done. Unless you're. I mean, unless that's what people really want. Once people what they really want, it's conflict lumens. That's just human nature. You know?

Speaker 2:          00:22:34       It's possible, right?

Speaker 3:          00:22:35       So avatar is nicer than people advertise, nicer than people I think. I don't think we would make fake people to deal with our animals. We would fucking kill him. So for people that say that, that's. Oh, you moved pitch people in bird load

Speaker 4:          00:22:53       mercenaries, man. That's, that's crazy job. Those kinds of space mercenaries. Motherfucker, don't you play doom, right? Those dudes are serious space mercenaries. That's an excellent character. If you're playing quake three, you know, it'd be a space marine. Fuck you bitch. Tough characters.

Speaker 3:          00:23:13       So I have an eight year old pole that was revisited recently. It was about pooping poop. Standing or sitting or wiping. It's pretty funny though. It's gained popularity. Again, wipe, standing up or sitting down. What do you know how a white motherfucker, we've talked about this. I know we've talked on this. W O W I stand up to get a good goddamn white bed. I'll tell you this, I was using those flushable wipes, you know, to keep my button

Speaker 1:          00:23:46       nice and fresh and tidy. You got 50, 58. Those aren't good man. Fifty slash 50. No, no, no, no. Even if 50 slash 50 that the problem with those wipes is can't really flush them. They call them fly and bone, but I've added to my house twice. That's how stupid bitches. The pack up in your pipes. You can't flush them. You know? How many are you using? Like 15 to Russia. But you can do that. So then the only other option is you have to either have a bad day, which I have never used. Why don't you use it? I would totally love one because I'm an American. I think it's great. It's like, Hey American, I want to force it up my butt hole. It doesn't even look remotely comfortable or inviting fracture so hard. Whoever the fuck invented that, that asked me to machine.

Speaker 1:          00:24:30       They're hard people, man, because that thing is just like polished. It's white and there's like steel and chrome. It doesn't look like anywhere. You want to put your asshole really warm and soft and inviting. Police your asshole here. We'll clean it off for you know, it looks like metal and fucking. It's 2010. If you need a better way to clean my asshole with a machine and this stupid little monster looking thing. It looks like a torture contraption. It looks like a faucet and looks like someone's going to shut that other stick right up your asshole and you turn it on and water goes inside your body or something. I mean that's what it looks like. It's just make like a robot Asian face head that just eats your ass. I can pick her up. He was like leaning against it and he's like, yeah, clean it because it looks like Lucy Lu.

Speaker 1:          00:25:18       What about for you? What about for girls though? We need something for girls. Wouldn't be a black guy with the same one that cleans her husband's asshole. I guarantee if there was an asshole cleaning machine and it was a woman's face like a really hot Asian woman, will your wife would want her own asshole cleaning machine right next to magic Johnson or you send a picture, a photo to the manufacturer over father and they send back the father. Imagine if you could do that. I mean, why can't you do that soon in the future? I guarantee you in the future there's going to be toilet seat that looked like celebrities. They can eat your ass hole. Julia Roberts. Look, somebody's twitter this down that this is the future because we're going to forget this. Twitter me this please toilet seats. They look like celebrities and they clean your asshole that that is the future.

Speaker 1:          00:26:12       Genetic like fake leg. They're so close to like replicating different parts of human beings. You know they. They created a woman's bladder, took her bladder and they've used stem cells and they created. They took a piece of her bladder. They created a big bladder for her, were doing do incredible things. Now that's going to be a. that's going to be able to happen. You're going to have to be able to have puff Daddy, right? Your asshole. It's gonna look like, like those wax figures, like that's famous. It's gonna feel like flash and they're going to have emotions and all he wants to do is lick your asshole. That's it. But yeah,

Speaker 3:          00:26:44       but they have emotions. Sometimes they would cry and be sad when I think Julia Roberts face going. No, no, no. Who would you have if you had, if you have the ability to buy any celebrity. Megan Fox, Megan Fox News. But as a gag gift I would get my friends like, Hey, I got your uh, Brad Pitt. Be Brutal though. If like, what if your friends really liked. It's not even a real person bro. Fuck. I want my asshole clean. I liked, I liked it. What do you give a shit? It's not even a real guy because it's the guy's image because image, images eat your ass. Who would you do? I don't know man. I have to think about that. I would go right from Megan Fox, but I would also have like a, like, like a different one for special occasion. Maybe I'd go with like Traci Lords right when she became legal chapman. It's like Tracy Chapman, Tracy Lawrence. Because like the craziest porno story ever. You know that story. I was thinking a divided lims player from Mathis.

Speaker 4:          00:27:48       I met her. Oh No. Oh, vh one thing. One of those, uh, like uh, they did a bunch of shows called the list and I got to sit down with a rob Halford from Judas priest. He was one of the guests. Meatloaf was one of the guests and I hosted it and she was on a tour. She was one of the guys. She was very nice, very. She seems like an like a normal human, but she was so super hot man when she was young. Who? Not that she's not super on now. It's pretty hard now, but God damn, when she was young it was just ridiculous. She got into porn at like 16. Lied about her age. They're all illegal.

Speaker 3:          00:28:23       Yeah. I've never seen one on my computer ever. Yeah, I mean it should be illegal. I totally understand. I'm with you. I know there's plenty of porn. It's so funny. Back then though, the seventies looked like an old lady, you know, like, like I, you look back at 70 videos. Those kids don't look like kids. They look like older women like cougars. Here's something that I really like. Your hair and your makeup. They did dress crazy, but it's so fascinating, man. Those whole pawns are fascinating. Know Donna, you liked that one? I like her. She's, she's always favorite too, I think. Yeah. I just like her because she's like real. It's like, hey look, here's a picture of my butthole. Very real. She'll shock you with her. Yeah, she's got great twitter's. If you don't follow her, it's not safe for work. And you click on it and it's a gaping butthole with. Yeah. Kind of like, yeah, that's kind of not safe for work. Talk about, you know, the understatement of the year award. Okay, hold on. If you don't want to see a gaping butthole dog, God dot. It's funny because she was doing an asshole movie and she was like practicing all week. He's like, I got to practice more like a fist up or God bless

Speaker 4:          00:29:42       her. God bless you girl. Keep going with it. Enjoy.

Speaker 4:          00:29:48       So a three d porn coming soon. It is coming soon, man. I was at the uh, the Sony store, the Sony store at the mall and they have the three d tv and you put glasses on and you turn them on with a button and it's just like watching anime tie three dates. Fucking insane. They had sports on. I had soccer and the soccer balls fucking flying by you. I mean it's really wicked. It just like so much more immersive. It's really, really cool. And that's going to be on TV soon, man. It's coming out this summer in 2010. They're going to have the first units out and then it's going to just explode so crazy. They're going to be filming in three days. Everything. Everything's going to be in three d.

Speaker 3:          00:30:32       yeah. I got something to add to the old crop dusting theory. I was thinking of this the other day. It was like the crop dusting pot on people. No, no. I mean Shit. Kim Trail. That's something I did the whole Kim trails discussing. I thought of you better night. So if you're going to do like spray this shit over cities, we know where people are going to be like, what the fuck is that? Why don't you do it at night? Yes.

Speaker 4:          00:30:58       Hey, should we do it when everyone can see it in is awake or should we do at three in the morning? That's part of the eval or well-planned. The evil plan is that they sprayed right above them. They willingly, you know, allowed these politicians to control them with the spray in the sky. You know, who really, really, really believes that shit is prince prince is like crazy. But chem trails, he was like, you know, so crazy. We would all be in the ghetto and everybody would be playing and having a good time. And then they'd start spraying that shit over our heads and all of a sudden everybody was fighting like, why are we fighting? What's it about? Like what the fuck are you talking about? All right. People always fight. There's always violence. Like what are you insane? Any place where people are poor, people are violent. Shut the fuck up. Like you really think that they're spraying shit from the sky that's making people in poor communities be violent. Wowza people believe some nasty shit.

Speaker 3:          00:31:55       Can you imagine being stuck in an elevator with prints that would be.

Speaker 4:          00:31:59       Love it for that. He's a genius. She to just be in that guy's presence and just talk to him. A fascinating dude, but sometimes even dudes who are geniuses at anything, whether it's playing chess or you know, being a martial artist, there's sometimes there's something wrong with them to get them there. There's something about getting really amazing at something. People that are the very, very best at something who almost all crazy. It's really hard not to be, you know? Could you imagine if you like the best in the world? Like a Lance Armstrong type dude? How's that? Do not fucking crazy.

Speaker 4:          00:32:38       It is. Pancakes. Pancakes was on about waking up in the morning making a difference. Kicks. Oh, that story. Yeah. I can't tell you a personal story. Ladies and gentlemen. I protect my friends. Who was Joe Rogan? Who are you, man? How Dan Jones home? I was thinking deep thinking deep being mean to me. Yeah. But if he has, if he to be asked that same question to John Malcovich, you'd be like, who is John Malcovich? I'll tell you, you know, like, you really look at that different products. We boot this up, my shit is whack. How awesome is that? Uh, Dana White's playing or the pride shit on spite of so much. Awesome man. I've been addicted to it. There is so much fun. I showed Brian the, uh, the difference between the rules Brian was alive, talked about in my blog where when the dude tried to stomp the dude, he went, he could do that.

Speaker 4:          00:33:47       You remember? Yeah. I was really stoned. And next thing I know this guy is like stopping this guy's brain. And I'm like, Whoa, whoa. Is he trying to kill the guy? Fucked up. It was pretty fucked up. It's like when you watch those, uh, those pride fights, like they were pretty fucked up. You know, it's like old school, UFC. ECI. Yeah. But you know, there's something about the way they did it. Man. I like it. I love the fact that they did 10 minute rounds. The first round was cold. That's great. That's how it should be. Yeah. Well, you know, and everybody says no bullshit because it's too hard in the fighters. I don't necessarily know if that's true. You know, there's a lot of times where a momentum is being established and it's been established and you would like to see where it goes.

Speaker 4:          00:34:26       You don't want to see him like fuel up and have some water in the corner. I want to see where it goes from there. From there, have a dude works for like four minutes and finally gets out of the ground. Or if a guy gets taken out immediately and a dude finally gets up and there's only 20 seconds left and then the dude starts bombing on him and then the guy who took him down as tired, I want to see what the fuck is happening. Keep going. You know? I mean, that's what I think. That's what the best guys would want. The best guys would want to see that they would want to see a big ass 10 minute round, but he put it in the interest of the safety of the fighters though they're going to take less damage than a five minute round.

Speaker 4:          00:34:57       That's why I accepted. I accepted unified rules because if you look at it like in terms of like what's what's going to be the most palatable for the American people for the American public. Yeah. That's the most palatable five minute rounds, five rounds for championship fights. I totally agree with all that stuff. The only thing sometimes I think that I would substitute knees on the ground for elbows, I think needs from that position when you're holding onto a guy and you can name and the face, elbows on the ground, cut that shit out to dudes and sometimes they fuck up fights, you know, they, they, they, they'll end a fight early. That was like a really good fight and it's because of a cut and they usually. That doesn't happen, but occasionally, you know, the UFC is so much better about that than

Speaker 4:          00:35:37       boxing the. Any, any kind of a bad cut and they'll stop the fight like right away, UFC lit Stephan struve fight and he had like a hatchet wound in his head. I mean it was a giant cut. It was a giant cut and then led the fight, go and eventually got the dude down and choked him out. And it was an incredible fight. I mean he was busted wide open, covered with blood. It was insane. And after it was over, the guy was so dizzy, he had lost so much blood, he could barely talk to me and I was talking to him after the fight. It was incredible though. They would never let that happen in a boxing match. I think it was kind of crazy that that fight took place in Germany because the Germans were kind of reluctant to have the UFC there.

Speaker 4:          00:36:17       And then I was like thinking like, wow, this is one of the bloodiest fights ever and you know, this is where it's going to take place. And that place where they were apprehensive about it, you know, apparently a bunch of German dudes came down to see the UFC. And I'm in Vegas and you know, they didn't like it. They thought it was horrific and violent. What's kind of like pink spinning with the water? You see that on the grammy's that, that girl is so talented. That's pretty amazing though. She's very talented and she something about her, her, her performance charisma. Like when she walks on stage it's like you have to like step back, you know, she's got it. Whatever it is, she's got it, she's hot. She's, she's like, there's something about just the way that she just walks on stage and sings so confidently and so commonly like her energy.

Speaker 4:          00:37:08       It's like that's a girl that's like born to perform. That bitch can perform her fucking ass off. And when and then when she goes up in the air, you're going to go, oh well the other ones are going to do the acrobatic. She ain't gonna do shit. She's just kinda like get lifted up. No, she gets all fucking crazy and she's looking in this half naked outfit and she dumped in one arm. She's spinning around and then she turns up, she, she spinning with her head down and she's singing at the same time. That's, that's the baddest bitch and music period. Everybody else. Shut the fuck up. Shut the fuck up, man. Pink just owned all those bitches. All of them. Lady. God got sit the fuck down. But did you not see what happened? Can you do that if you can't Shop Lady Gaga? It was pretty good too. I didn't see it. That fucking poker face song made me want to punch holes through walls. I like leading. I like it all. You Want Fella? Busy man. I love. I love chick songs. I love when chick saying people get in my car and the thick. It's a joke, dude. You got to get this us CD tieger APP. Let me think. Maybe I told you already. Tig Rue twitter recently. They've fucking jam man. You know punk checks puncture? Yeah, I'll do it. I'm all over that.

Speaker 4:          00:38:27       I love chicks with great voices. Like people get in my car and like I have sheryl crow on and they would think it was a joke. Like what are you joking like that? I like the long. That's good cd. It is her voice, her voice is like comforting. You know, her voice makes me want to like, feel like you're going to cuddle up in the corner of the fire ceremony locking. She's given you a big hug with her voice.

Speaker 2:          00:38:50       No,

Speaker 3:          00:38:53       it's French for breeders. The breeders remember them. There were lines that sing a big song in nineties, uh, mean splashed

Speaker 4:          00:39:05       turner and every man in our banner banner, they were like big and then they just went away. Yeah, I think it's really hard to keep a musical band together. You know, I know Eddie has a hard time, like keeping, like he's, he does a bunch of different projects all at the same time, so it doesn't ever has to rely on any one person. Right. And he runs all of them. It's got to be super hard to keep a bunch of people who are like wanting to be stars and you know, wanting to just can't wait to get rich and get nutty and fucking lose their marbles and think that they're the reason why this bands there in the first place and how many arguments like that happen in bands, you know, they're all nuts. They're all wanting to want to be the outfit. So very rare that a band like can really, you know, like foo fighters, band or something like that could really come together and just be that she's bad ass band and keep it together and make good music so hard. You know, it seems like bands, bands are good for like, they're good for like a couple of cds and then it just gets rough for, for most of all the rare few can just keep jamming on, you know, the rare few, like the rolling stones just keep it together forever. That's nuts.

Speaker 2:          00:40:15       No,

Speaker 4:          00:40:17       like they don't go out. Like the crazy thing about the rolling stones is they're calling out like a young rock band. Like they, they, they fucking, you know, Mick Jagger still bounced around on stage and yelling and shit. Like he's in incredible shape, you know? That's that, that's the amazing thing about how the stones are doing it. It's not like he's just, you know, decided in his later years, he just gonna stand there and sing the song still fucking running around and he still takes his shirt off and shit and least it looks like a monster, you know,

Speaker 3:          00:40:47       looks like a bunch of Nice. He just glued a bunch of Nice Lotion in the basket. Guy made a hilarious, but he's got like a six pack and shit. The dude has to be in insane shape to do that act that says that's incredible

Speaker 4:          00:41:06       men. Mick Jagger still keeping it out there. Yeah. So his, uh, what's his name? Springsteen and all those guys. Yeah. Yeah. He's still out there doing crazy for our concerts and shit. You know what man? Those guys have people that have them. There's people, there's people that have fans. And then there's people like Bruce springsteen that have people that worship him and live for the fact that Bruce springsteen is alive and their whole day revolves around springsteen and they probably post on a message board some there somewhere and their message board name. It's probably like be springsteen or something like that. You know what I'm saying? Or some obscure nicknamed that they know that Bruce springsteen had when he was younger that they dropped after awhile. You know what I'm saying? You know the fucking, the Long Island Expressway, whatever the fuck it would be. You know, whenever they were calling people get nutty, mad.

Speaker 4:          00:42:02       You know, people get nerdy about people. Especially Jersey guys. He's from Jersey. Bruce Springsteen, he's from Jersey City, New Jersey and Jersey. They get fucking crazy. People are so crazy. They're savages. They are savages. That's why I was born by the way, don't get angry. I'm talking about me. I just saw a kitchen nightmares that was in Jersey and it's like the whole family was just out of out of their mind. There are some of the toughest guys that fight in the UFC or from church. Frankie Edgar, Jim Miller, Dan Miller, those guys are all Jersey guys. They're fucking savages there. Are there different kinds of dudes? They will fight you. They will fucking punch you in the head. It's like this. It's a totally different type of human being than like the average dude that grows up. Like in California. People are so much more relaxed in California, so much friendlier, so much nicer.

Speaker 4:          00:42:48       Jersey people will punch you in your fucking head. It's not all of them, you know, and they're not bad guys. They're not. They're not mean. They're just. There's a level of tension in certain towns. Philly's another one. There's a level of tension and Philly, you know, that the dudes would come out of. There are so many bad assets come out of Philadelphia. Boxers. Joe Frazier came out of Philadelphia. Bernard Hopkins came out of Philadelphia and MMA got Eddie Alvarez comes out of Philadelphia and Philadelphia is filled with fucking and nimbles. You know, that's a crazy ass tough town. It's weird how there's towns like that is that there's certain towns that just have like, like, you know, no one thinks of like San Francisco is being like aggressive. You know what I'm saying? Like it's like that's like kind of a relaxed town. You'd almost feel like if you got mugged in San Francisco, you're a pussy, but no, there's like regular people in San Francisco.

Speaker 4:          00:43:39       There's violence there to but some places is just way more violent. Right. Columbus, you grew up in Columbus, Ohio. Was that don't get tense in the winter? No, not really, but the worst is I like Cleveland, Cleveland's getting bad, but Michigan driving through Michigan and go to the casinos. That was scary. Like cars on fire and houses. They got bears walking through Detroit. They're spotted bears in the city of Detroit. There's so many abandoned houses that bears are starting to move back around. That's nuts. Yep. Bears in Detroit. Wow. That's spooky shit, man. That's like one of my bits really is. That's like the the bed I have about the, the, the dumb people out bringing smart people, smart people die off and everything shuts down and then the dumb people are stuck there, but in this case it's poor, unfortunate people that were actually born in this one town.

Speaker 4:          00:44:30       It's happening. So you know, Detroit is falling apart like this insane rate and it's not getting any better. It's like they say that it's over 50 percent joblessness in Detroit because they report like 20 something percent, but the rest of them are just people who have stopped. They stopped counting them after a year. It's crazy, man. Scary. You know, we used to make the coolest fucking cars ever. If you compare just on a coolest factor, like some of the cars that America is making in like 1969 and then like Alpha Male, those gay looking pieces of shit, those goofy looking clump boxes take a 19, 67 corvette over all those bitches. You know, America is making so radical fucking cars, man. 60 seven vet, 69 Camaro.

Speaker 3:          00:45:19       Pretty good. Pretty good. Cars are starting to a jk just got news today that she has two recalls on our Toyota and she's like, Holy Shit, I have one of these cars, and she's like, what am I supposed to do? And they're like, oh, well, you know, just drive careful. And uh, she's like, whoa. Have you heard that gets stuck on. No, they're not even saying that. There's some people that are saying that whatever programming is a Steve Wasniak I said that he's figured out that it's a software error. Omar. And so now we're thinking, wait our cars to go crazy over software. Now you got, you got pc in your car, now it's got a virus, and now I can control your car and lock the doors. Oh my God, I didn't even think about that. Somebody can bluetooth your fucking and it hack your car right next to you.

Speaker 3:          00:46:04       They can hack your car, lock the doors like mission impossible style on the breaks. Yeah. I wonder what the fuck they can do to stop shit like that from happening. That's craziness. I didn't even think about that. And did you hear that nine one, one call of the people that were in one of the cars that led to the recall, there's a nine one, one call that you can listen to where the guy's like, hi, we're going to have three words. We're going to be at 120. Our brakes aren't working. We can't turn off the car. And we're. And we're, we're going towards the end of the freeway and we're, we're, we're going through an intersection like family of four, something like that. It's awful. All because of this Toyota Bullshit. I don't even want to hear about this one. Yeah, that's scary as fuck man. Check out google a nine slash 11. Call Toyota. Recall

Speaker 4:          00:46:49       Jesus. Well, I have Alexis. Alexis has made by

Speaker 3:          00:46:54       right? I think actually it wasn't lexis that have you checked to see cars on a recall list? No. You better do it right now. Jessica just did it today to two recalls on her car. Get the fuck. I swear to God. Doing it with. And Alexis was the one that was now correct. So yeah, I'm pretty sure here. Let's Google that. Alexis, nine one one call

Speaker 4:          00:47:16       toilet lexis. It's a matte recall. It's a mat. They're not saying anything about a software software

Speaker 3:          00:47:23       thing. No. Steve Wasniak the lake. We're wozniaks said doubt about it. It was on in gadget yesterday. Let's, um, let's

Speaker 4:          00:47:30       post it up for people because this is kind of important. Otherwise we can get in trouble, right?

Speaker 3:          00:47:35       Not really, but he said that if he didn't know you could say he says he likes to suck cock. You know, she just made something of them. You can't be saying that. I can make that up. Brian, when Steve was neck, my dog. Shit. Dog. You guys tight? Yeah, I didn't know bu my gosh,

Speaker 4:          00:47:56       they added a multitouch to the that new google phone. Yeah, just like an iphone does the same thing. It's about time now. Nobody owns the right to do that. Nobody owns it.

Speaker 3:          00:48:09       Supposedly apple had the US patent night. So. So what are they selling it to? All these people probably,

Speaker 4:          00:48:16       but I don't know if that's all speculation. Actually. It's probably Gizmodo there. You can't find that you mother was google. Is this Gizmo Gizmo Bitch fucking Internet. Shelly's, well, we've got to find out which cars were, uh, were recalled and whether or not Steve was nag actually said it was a software issue. That's scary. She's really pissed. That's scary shit because that guy's a super genius. One of the guys who helped create apple, you know, and uh, you know, that's not something that Erica would say lightly. Okay. Toyota, to borrow Steve Wozniaks Prius for a week. No, that's not it. No, no. That's software and duplicate either. That's it. Yup. Toyota Prius has scary software program. He could duplicate. Told the crowd chromosomes. Social situation problem in the Prius.

Speaker 4:          00:49:19       Oh, it's not under a recall. This is software. It's not a bad accelerator pedal. It's very scary. Whoa. Toyota has had. Toyota has this accelerator problem we've all heard about. I have many models of Prius that got recalled, but I have a new model of didn't get recalled. This model has an accelerator that goes wild, but only under certain conditions have cruise control. And I can repeat it over and over again safely. Whoa. That's fucking terrifying. That's what's the greatest thing about old cars. Old Cars are fucking terrible to drive like my old 1970 Barracuda. Yeah. But there's, there's something about old cars where there's no computer running. Nothing was like a direct experience between you and the engine. You know what I'm saying? Like those old, the old sound of the engine, everything about it connected to the car. It was all connected. There ain't no fucking computer is going to save you bitch. It's just a car. You better not get crazy but better. I think you can, you know, take that turn to too quick and you know, the wheels will lock up on the outside so you'll be all right. No you're fuck man. That's not gonna save you one of the many reasons

Speaker 1:          00:50:28       not to buy a prius. You know, it's really interesting. Um, I think it was a prius that they did. They did this because a priest is a hybrid, right? Yes. Yeah. There was a prius. Then they took a prius. This is what they did. This on top gear. That fucking awesome car show on the BBC if you haven't seen it. So you can get it on BBC on like do you get direct TV? They have like BBC America and it's a, it's an awesome car show and they did this test with a. took a prius and they ran around a track as fast as it could go as fast as they could get it to go around the track and they followed it with a bmw m three, which has a big Vat and they found out that all the BMW, all BMW had to do was to stay at the same pace as the Prius.

Speaker 1:          00:51:10       Just keep up with it. That's all it had to do. Well when they measure the miles per gallon, the BMW got more miles per gallon in the Prius. It's like when you drive it fast, it looks like it's a piece of shit. It's like yeah, that's your reasoning. There's no reason to. And the long run, the price also costs so much more money that you'll be spinning on the car that it's not even worth the money you save on their gross look into. And it was. I think they said it was like the difference between like the Prius was only getting like 14 miles to the gallon. The BMW got like 17 or 18.

Speaker 3:          00:51:41       Yeah. By the way, I posted a number of Steve Wiszniak video has posted at my twitter, which is backslash red band. I'm going to retweet, retweet, retweet, retweet, fucking know how we do and what's awesome. We're talking about the IPAD now, so a manufacturer a that's going to fix I pads. He has a company that fixes i-phones fixes like a third party warranty guy. Could you tweet that? Yeah, I just thought, well you just gotta you just gotTa do it now.

Speaker 2:          00:52:14       Oh, that's it.

Speaker 3:          00:52:16       Just because you're using that. I'll go to my twitter page to how you're supposed to do it.

Speaker 1:          00:52:25       That's gross. And your twitter page if you don't use tweet deck, man, you live in. So 2000. I don't tweet that much. Oh yeah. Whatever lies. I forgot what I was saying. Yeah, because you're stoned.

Speaker 3:          00:52:39       Oh, so this ipad manufacturer that is going to fix it pads, he fixes iphones. Just got a shipment. Every placement bezels for the IPAD. So if he ever has to replace that and it has a spot for a camera in it and that the software has caused to a camera and all those other things. So the IPAD, they might not even be done with the Ipad, like it's going to come in with a camera and all these other things. Probably that's what it looks like.

Speaker 1:          00:53:03       So this is just the beginning. So the first one is just this plane. The first one was not finished as well. A lot of people are thinking like it was like a prototype because that's why it's two months away and stuff. They were still really. This is all, this sounds like some fucking conspiracies type marketing shit to probably think probably. Why would you do that though? Why would you release a crappy one or you get a crappy ones? You were going to be talking about it every time there's a new rumor, you know, like, oh now it has a. well maybe they'll hold off for a few months and then come up with a version two. Maybe they'll do that. But if there are any doing anything like the iphone, it's probably once a year down man. They got people that bitches. Apple has more people that are bitches and than any other company in the world. Did you see the spice shot of the next iphone?

Speaker 1:          00:53:50       Which is funny because I was just thinking how I'm a little bit of an apple bitch. I'm going to be honest with you. They got me a little while. I get all fucking hyped up when I fly out to have a new announcement. I get fired up and I don't remember the last time I ever got fired up for anything that Microsoft makes a. it's funny because these photos that get released like this photo, the next iphone is so awful. It could be just like a box on the ground and it's like people are freaking out about this. You know what's really funny? People? What does that. That is what people are hilarious about. That looks like an iphone man. People retarded. I know who gives a shit whether you use windows or Mac, everybody gets nutty. That's what's really crazy about all this shit is that people pick teams, you know, they're on team windows or Mac.

Speaker 1:          00:54:35       Like what the fuck do you care? Like really? You want to. Why do, why does everybody want to using the same shit? It's, if you don't prefer it, that's fine. I don't give a fuck and taken pictures and had a picture online, you know, have me on a laptop and you see the little apple thing. Oh Joe, what the fuck do you know you use Mac so gay. Like what? You're upset at the choice of computer. I make weird what? I'm on the wrong computer team. Really? We have computer teams. We team up for everything. We are fucking dumb. God Damn. People are dumb. We argue over fucking operating systems. People get mad if you choose the wrong brand of car. Like there's dudes would get mad at their buddies for buying Chevy's the fuck bro. Ford for life, for life bro. We were Ford for live dumb assholes.

Speaker 1:          00:55:22       They have like the picture of the Calvin and hobbes peeing on the Chevy logo. You know, and it's weird thing. There's just certain things that are like, like coke and Pepsi, Pepsi, what the fuck? What the fuck is wrong with? Is there a definitive difference between the two of them? Who Fountain when you go to like a sub shop and he ran the fountain. That could be anything. Diet coke, diet coke. It's like there's a certain amount of sweetener, a certain amount of color and just shut the fuck up and drank it. That's pig slop, man. That's some shit. You only drink because you're starving or you're drunk. Motherfuckers. People are so God damn dumb. US included sometimes, but not as much. Not as much as last year. Moving forward for the future. Always trying to evolve. Hey, how you see that video of this? Somebody filmed at the space shuttle blowing up. Yeah. It's pretty trippy. Those two old George, weird, dire trouble

Speaker 5:          00:56:25       growing up in the. When it exploded

Speaker 4:          00:56:28       in this guy and started spinning around separate pieces. That's not trouble.

Speaker 5:          00:56:37       Brian. The Usual Jimminy cricket. I know I'm never going to get in trouble. You've got to go to school. Come here and that trouble in this guy. What a horrible, tragic handkerchief

Speaker 4:          00:56:52       feed the woman. Not to belittle the challenger, exploding. I remember I was watching that. I was at this girl's house. I was like, it was 1986, so I was. It wasn't any sex like 19 years old. Completely lost it. No idea what I was doing my life. I had a hard time getting laid. Very difficult. So this ex girlfriend who lived like an hour and a half away and I was talking on the phone and we're talking dirty and she wanted me to drive up to visit her and it was such a fucking long drive and it was the winter. It was snowing out and I'm an idiot and I went out there and

Speaker 4:          00:57:24       completely forgot what I was talking about. How high am I work out and you're watching challenger, so what? So we're sitting there and we're sitting there in front of the television in the morning and she goes to the bathroom and I turned on the TV and right when I turned the TV it fucking exploded. It was that second. Wow. Right when I turned on the TV, they were showing it and I don't know if it was a replay, I don't think it was. It's hard to remember, but I remember like very clearly at the moment I turned on the TV, the image of the thing exploding, what's happening right there, and you were seeing spiral and you're like, what the fuck is that? It was like a weird, like, what is that? What's going on over there?

Speaker 4:          00:58:01       And then people started talking about it and then it took a while before they just flat out admitted, okay, everybody's dead. Like that shit just blew up. Like I think for awhile they were like wondering whether or not the people that survived, if the capsule it made it to the ground, you know, they're looking for parents, shoots and shit. It was all sorts of different kinds of reports. But I remember thinking, Holy Shit, those people just got shot through the fucking air and exploded in the sky. What a crazy way to go. What a crazy thing to do.

Speaker 3:          00:58:32       No, it's so weird. When I saw it, I saw it with a bunch of people and we all had to watch tv because we were in middle school and it happened and to start crying and I just remember like, oh, what's going on? And the teachers were all freaking because you couldn't like just text your mom like, hey mom, do you know what happened? So you have to get like these birds and tight messages to a man who swift to foot knows the way home quickly run some amazing how back in the day you just had no communication with friends and family and you call people and if you've got a hold of them, you got a hold of them. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:59:07       Have you didn't mean it must've been so easy to get away with everything back then.

Speaker 3:          00:59:12       Oh, everything. I was thinking about having a second where you were. When I was a teenager, I would have sex in public places because I went. I wasn't allowed to have sex at home, so I'd go to like behind little Caesar's and fuck behind beside the dumpster. And one time this guy came out and was like shocked. Like he worked at these places, he goes, Oh, I'm sorry you want some pizza? Because he thought we were homeless, but I'm thinking nowadays you on the ground laying on her and it was just like God, but now ground on the dirt dude. We used to do it in movie theaters, theaters all the time. Or I could just get her to like climb on top and he goes to fern. Golly, you know, because no one else was there during the day watching fern gully. But you're in the back half the fern gully having sex. But nowadays, can you imagine I can't do that because it will be filmed and on youtube done on youporn because like everyone just filming and I wonder if kids are having a hard time finding places to have sex without cameras are being back.

Speaker 4:          01:00:02       Yeah, it's not, it's not like nasty. They know what's really fucked up is this whole sexting thing with young kids. And what's happening if you don't know, is that these young kids are sending, you know, you give a 13 year old cell phone. They're going to take pictures of their dicks to girls. Girls are going to take pictures of the posters. The boys, it's musical girl. There's always going to be one freak bitch in the class. It's willing to take it to the next level. All right. There's always one girl whose dad was not around and she needs male attention and she needs it extremely bad and she's willing to fucking logout. We are so lucky because my shit would have been everywhere. There'd be live video of me just having sex on web cams if this gets pretty crazy, pretty crazy. You know? It's just really wrong that kids, when you're that young, you make all kinds of fucking mistakes.

Speaker 4:          01:00:51       People, they do all kinds of stupid shit. Your dumb. The fact that kids today, like anything you say and do. Back then it was like, that shit is like a record forever. You know, any, any blog you write, any space picks you post up like that Shit's a record of you for the rest of your life. You know, and for some kids, fuck up and pictures of them suck. A deck. Then some dude who ordinarily would like really loved this chick, but can't get over the fact that there's this picture that every one of his friends has of her sucking her ex boyfriends, cock that's online. I think he just freaks out. He can't fucking deal with it and that ruins the relationship because this dude can't deal with the fact there's a picture online that anybody could say where I've his wife, the mother of his children, supposedly someday and some other guys deck, especially if it's a black guy, right?

Speaker 4:          01:01:43       We go back to the Julia Roberts hurt, hurt and that black eyes, let's be honest, you know, for the most part, except for obviously Brock Lesnar, he says that brock Lesnar was like a white guy with black guys. Check this shit out. This is a great email I got today from. Listen man, we're in a very tricky subject. Just interrupt me when I'm talking about genetics, black people, until I clarify that I'm not a racist. How dare you. It's very important because going to go into another medical thing, it's a funny thing that you would think that people would think that, uh, like saying that a black guy having a bigger deck. I'm black, I've been better sexually and you know, more, more troublesome to white dudes. You why? How would that be racist? Wouldn't that be like positive for black eyes? Could you imagine what people are saying that about you racist? He's digging, but there's a lot of people that if you say that, if you put it that way, like there, there's people that think that black eyes

Speaker 6:          01:02:37       oversexed black lives

Speaker 4:          01:02:40       more well endowed.

Speaker 6:          01:02:43       Hold on.

Speaker 4:          01:02:48       Is that your page or making that noise?

Speaker 2:          01:02:56       What the fuck? What the fuck got suckered

Speaker 4:          01:03:05       anyway, ladies and gentlemen, what we're talking about guys. Dicks. If you're not scared, you're not paying attention. Go Online. There's some incredible fucking porn out there where you can't believe that's really. That guy's dead. How many black guy? Because it's fake though. Like there's a lot of them is fake and there's a lot of them that are real giant dicks. There's a lot of them do. There's some dudes like, what's that guy's name? Lexington steals dicks like 14 inches long and it's like like an arm. It's huge. It's gigantic. That's real snow. White guys like that online, you know, because even like John Holmes, you want to go old school. John Holmes at a big duck, but he was club you with it it and stabbing me with it. It was so big. It never totally got hard. It was like an elephant's trunk. Never got hard.

Speaker 4:          01:03:51       It was disappointing. He had like this super hot checks and they were trying to suck his dick, but he was on heroin doubt with this giant rubber monster. Dick has trying to snake it into their mouths. You know? It was never like a, like a black guy's giant Dick Black. I was trying to dig. That thing's going to do south. Done some shit's going down. Have you been to the playboy mansion before? Yeah, I was there a couple times for the strikeforce fights. I went there for once. I had to do a, a fear factor broadcast. It was early in the morning and for a marijuana project where you going to told me that like everything's like so antique, like the old way old. Yeah. There's something cool about it. I mean there's something ridiculous about that. They have an upgraded it and change it for the. But there's something kind of cool but a.

Speaker 4:          01:04:30       because it really stopped thinking about. I mean this is just a party house, right? Like isn't it kind of dope that this is the same phone from 1970? I mean it's a fucking, it's like a rotary phone and shit man. You know? Or if it's a push button phone, I can't remember. It's a rotary or push buttons, but if it's pushed by some old wack ass look and Shit, you know. But that's kind of cool because it makes you part of is like, yeah, that's, you know, they should upgraded, that's not even cool anymore. That's shit too tired. But there's so much history to it that it's almost like a living museum to like Hollywood, you know? I mean think about how many people partied in that place. You know, that's like where James Caan was always hanging out. Holly shore, pauly shore, and fucking first is always hanging out there. Have you seen the biodome thing that's been abandoned by scientists? Remember that thing that like the movie the biodome is all about the indoor

Speaker 3:          01:05:18       don't those with pauly shore, Steven. That's a real. Don't know. That's a real biodapt really? Yeah, and now it's like abandoned and like they showed it and has been. This is where they were doing experiments with seeing people could live together in this one. Right. And they abandoned it. What happened in those experiments? Right. I don't know.

Speaker 4:          01:05:34       I thought that was a funny mood at the time. I thought it was silly. It was funny.

Speaker 3:          01:05:40       Andrew dice clay is all the movie forward. Farrell, where he's jumping off the building. He was like my hair, my hair back when that came out last year.

Speaker 4:          01:05:48       Dice Clay. And not that I'm not anymore, but I am. I am still. I think he's hilarious. I've got to see him. I've got to see dyfs, the comedy store. So many nights go up and who was just crushing people in the audience. He's a nut. He's a fun dude. You know, I liked this whole thing. I like his whole, his whole attitude, his demeanor. I think he's Hilarious, but when I was a kid, he was gigantic. There was no comedian. The kids were more excited about when I was a kid then dice clay when dice client blew up and when he started doing like Madison Square Garden and Shit, that's all anybody talked about. Dude. There was kids all day in school. Everybody below like, you know what's in the bowl bitch, you know, people would sit everywhere. Yeah. Something. Everybody was doing vice clay lines. You do a good dice.

Speaker 4:          01:06:34       Clay. I've been around him so many years, you know, at the comedy store. That was one of the craziest things about being a kid and being a fan of his and then being, you know, then starting to be an amateur comedian and then, you know, doing, getting paid gigs after a couple of years and then moving to California years and years later because that I would go on and I would have to introduce dice, you know, like the comedy store, the way it used to work and still does. Um, but the way it works is each comic brings up the next comment. So like I got brought on stage by Martin Lawrence. I was one of the first time somebody famous ever did it and you know, he brought me on stage and I was like, Holy Shit. Like Martin Lawrence just said my name and brought me. I was like, to me that was like a crazy deal.

Speaker 4:          01:07:17       Like, you know, see that guy on TV and movies and all of a sudden I'm shaking his hand and now I've got to go on stage after him and nobody knows who the fuck I am. But dice clay was the coolest. That was the craziest one ever that was like, you know, getting the WHO's next? Who? Joe Rogan, who the fuck is Joe Rogan and I don't remember how it said it, but what he brought me on this date, I was like, Holy Shit. Dice fucking clegg has brought me on stage. Like that was a. to me that was a fun moment. That was a crazy moment comedy. You know, when I was a kid, that guy was a the most hyped up comic ever. Mark Gaydon? Yes you did. You did open up for me in. I'm an England mark. Hayden is going to freak out. He keeps insisting that this mark Gaydon guy is not him, but whoever this guy is, I think he's representing Mark Hayden very well, so I'm going to keep pretending that he is him. Who is Joe Rogan? You're doing standup and CEO before the versus. Oh, who is Joe Rogan?

Speaker 1:          01:08:17       Hmm. Is that like how these kids are talking these days? Who is Joe Rogan is a new way of talking to people. That doesn't make any sense. That sounds cool. That does kind of sound cool. You know, what is your name dude?

Speaker 1:          01:08:31       Carpet version. Carpet version. Who is copper version? You know, if that's what you say when you see people instead of like, Hey, what's up dude? Say who is Joe Rogan? I'm I doing stand up in Colorado. Yeah, I'll be doing it somewhere. I don't know how many books, but I will definitely be there the night before. Whatever the uh, I think the UFC fights or on a Sunday night I think. I'm not sure, but whatever, whatever night there on the night before that, whether it's a Saturday or Friday, I'll be doing standup and I'll put it on twitter and I'll let you bitches now.

Speaker 1:          01:09:02       Have you heard of the cat that was predicted over 50 deaths in a nursing home? You know what that's like? That's like predicting alcoholics are going to drink. That's ridiculous. That's a terrible fucking prediction. Tell that fucking faggot cat to go predict. I know it is only curls up around people when they get to die. Yeah, right. When they're about to die, they're dying the job, but like flies thousand years old. They're a bunch of old people living with other old people that are dying. It's not a fun environment. It just goes back to that whole weird thing about how animals might have sensors that we don't even know about them and then when that video of the dog in here, it might be or it might be these people are hanging on by a thread so thin that tat hops in that last bucket that night.

Speaker 1:          01:09:42       Yeah, that's possible too, man. You gotTa admit it's possible. Can you discuss vaporizers? I would recommend vaporizers. The volcano is a very good one. It's sometimes kind of a pain in the ass. I mean at the end of the day, you don't want to be that guy that's sucking out of a plastic bag. It just seems like a junkie move. I'm not a fan. Right. It seems like junky behavior. Do we suck it out of a plastic bag? Something seems wrong, but there's another vaporizer that I enjoy. It's like a glass pipe, like a, like a glass lip, like sort of like a bond with a tube attached to it and you stick it on this thing and yeah. That's cool. That's cool one. You know what I like about that one? You don't need, you don't need like five friends around you to get high.

Speaker 1:          01:10:21       You know, like when that bag fills up, you don't know when to stop. Right. You keep sucking it in and then you're too high and then you're like, I can't even think that's not good. This is the other vaporizer. You can take one hit and Bam and you know what's up? I liked that one better, but if you got a party, you've got a bunch of people hanging around and you're all medical patients. Many bongs. No. Have you got a bunch of people around them? The volcanoes to shit, then it's perfect because for all being junkies together, man, I suck out of this plastic bag. It's weird. I'll keep it together. Yeah. There's some weird about sucking out of a plastic bag. Me, I'm just like, you know, like a joint. Just give me a joint. That's cool. I'm a fan of the joint too, you know. Well I joined because, first of all, because you don't have to keep lighting it. And I hated the taste of lighter fluid. No, that shit's nasty. Like if you have a glass pipe and you keep tasting that lighter fluid. Yeah. That shit ain't good for you. Especially when it's like a Zippo. You're like, Oh really? You got that shit. Ain't good for you man. I don't like it. I liked

Speaker 4:          01:11:14       joints. I'm converted joints, man. I liked that shit with a match, you know, if I can or if I'm doing it with a lighter, I'd get it real quick and I'll let it sit for a minute. And uh, I think there's a residue man that gets on, on the weed with those lighters and I think that Shit's bad for you. It's probably worse for you than smoking for some people. Like for your lungs. It's going to be very unhealthy man. It's like a toxic fume you're inhaling, you know, that ain't good. You know, we don't. There's no studies done. And you know how many times you can fucking suck off, lighter fluid and breathed into your lungs and not do permanent damage, you know, joint bitches matches and joint stop fucking around or go with vaporizer if you don't know what the vaporizer is. The beautiful thing is, is there's no fire, there's no smoke.

Speaker 4:          01:11:57       It's like a mixed. And what it is, is you pack the product, the memorable and put into, into this little filtered area. And then you connect that to this machine and then it heats up and then you inhale and it's literally like missed. And that missed is just the pure thc. It's a very heady experience. It's very, um, like you'll come up with some of your craziest thoughts on vaporized. We'd, except the only thing crazier is eating when you eat it. That's the craziest. I don't like that anymore. Eating. It gets scary. We've talked about that overheard of nutmeg. Man. Your Mama. Oh one. Oh eight, nine. Three. Yeah. Yeah. I heard you can get high off nutmeg somehow or another one of the guys are message board hr. I think he did it. He tried it and documented it. He said it was really tripping.

Speaker 4:          01:12:45       It lasted a long time and it's kind of gross. I think anything that's really good people would be doing it left and right. And I think there's plenty of shit to get high on. You know, we don't. But the one thing that I think is interesting, they came up with a new marijuana. It's a synthetic marijuana and it gives you like the same effects as regular marijuana, but you don't test positive. Yeah. And they're trying. They're scrambling right now to make it illegal and they call it two. It's called k named after that mountain. And it's a synthetic version of marijuana. So if you have, if you're a cop, if you have a government job and you have to piss tests all the time, you could smoke.

Speaker 1:          01:13:17       Does Shit. I used to in Ohio had the piss tests all the time. I need to go to the store and buy the shit. And it was scary when we be keeping pots for cops from smoking weed, if anybody should be smoking weed, it's cops. If anybody what? Cops should be smuggling weed. Cops should be smoking weed. Fuck yeah. The people that I'm down, everybody calm the fuck down. These are like intense people on. We'd like to be a cop. You kind of have to get like a bully, like stuff. I know a lot of guys so became

Speaker 4:          01:13:46       cops and a lot of them became cops because it's good money and they're tough guys. They do martial arts and they figure, you know what? I can handle most situations. I'm pretty friendly. I can handle this. This is good money. It's a good career. I could set myself up, have a nice pension. You got to look at it. Realistically people look at it as it's an economic choice for a lot of people. Know I have a lot of buddies that became cops. It's an economic choice. They just. There's a lot of people did a great job, man. If you can get into Boston police department

Speaker 1:          01:14:12       is. That's good. Fucking money. You can make a nice living. You know, you can get some, some detail work on the side, you know, and weekends and shit like that. You pick up big money,

Speaker 4:          01:14:20       no guardian places and shit like that, and it's a good job, man. It's not all Douche bags,

Speaker 1:          01:14:27       but there's a lot of douchebags that work for better cops that if they were stone would be horrible, man. Maybe they'd be more sensitive. We're not for everyone, that's for sure. It's not. They don't have to do it, but I think if they wanted to, they wanted a male out of the weekend, like Serpico memory when Serpico got high back in the seventies, so have a go. Didn't have. They didn't have a drug test for Shoboko Albert, you know, and he was a cop who's just walk away with

Speaker 4:          01:14:49       girl hanging out just like that movie superfly. That's remember. Yeah. I've never seen super fine. You never seen

Speaker 1:          01:14:57       superfly ladies and gentlemen, if you ever watched one blacksploitation movie from the seventies, it should be super fly. It's one of the most God damn brilliant film to have ever been created. And when you're high it becomes a mother fucking masterpiece because it's real. I mean, this is a real move where they're playing off real cool cats and one, one time this guy says, you know everything he's thinking about getting out of the game. I got off the thing. I ever

Speaker 4:          01:15:23       bonded my hall, my vines, a white woman like you, my hall, my vines of white with my hall, my car, my vines, my clothes and white women like you. Wow. It's genius, Dude. It's hilarious. It's such a bad movie. It's so fucking good. It's so bad. And so you could take a parody like airplane and they'll be funny but they'll never be as funny as something that's supposed to be good but isn't an. It's funny on accident. There's something about those that it's like a different kind of funny. You know what I mean? Like a holy shit funny. Like what the fuck were they thinking? Funny,

Speaker 1:          01:16:04       you know, and superfly is one of the best of that. Like sort of like showgirls is showgirls, you see showgirls and it's like, what the fuck are they doing? Like this movie crazy. You know, it's one of them.

Speaker 4:          01:16:16       What other movies are like that?

Speaker 1:          01:16:19       I just can't believe some movies from the eighties. I just can't believe people actually bought like the Howard, the duck maybe. I'm like, are you serious? Your cartoon or I'm a comic book goes Marvel Comics. I know. I can't believe he was cool in the seventies and the eighties to when I was a kid. I was a Howard. The duck fan. I would have by Howard. The duck books. Yeah, it's weird. I was a marvel comics fan and Howard the duck was a big part of marvel comics who had drifted in and out all sorts of comic books. They did a lot of cool shit with Howard the duck. I saw that movie theater and it was great because I was a kid and he was like. I remember he pulled out condoms, condoms to the Howard. The duck was cool when I was a kid because he was a duck, but he was an adult. He would. He was like a creepy duck, you know, just trying to get laid. I never read it. That was the Douglas Dope. I was a huge vitamix. Spiderman mostly. I love the x

Speaker 4:          01:17:10       men. I love Spiderman. The whole goes a big hug fan. A big Conan the barbarian fan got download, loved in, you know, I wish someone would have done. Someone will do a real cone and like almost in the style of gladiator, you know what I'm saying? Like a real high end, not a cheese ball one. I think they're doing another one, but it seems, I don't know, it's got the rock in it. I hate to be prejudiced coney island now and there's an image of him as cone and I mean he certainly looks the part and who knows, but maybe he could pull it off, but there's a certain amount of movies when you do a certain amount of kids movies, you know, after awhile I just felt like it's hard for me to watch you and something where you're crazy, you know, is making crazy money and still did good.

Speaker 4:          01:17:55       Fake aggression. Conan the barbarian. If you ever read the book, awesome. That was a big fan of the books. This Guy Robert e Dot Howard, wrote him and he was just mad genius who super depressed wrote all these books and I think he was only like 36 when he blew his fucking brains out. Just couldn't take it anymore. I just lived a terrible life, lived at his mother, was super depressed apparently, and just wrote these incredible fantasy books about, you know, far off lands and a fucking crew could not be beat, would destroyed cut men down, fight monsters, shit and all fucking all these chicks and drinking wine. And it just, he was just a, like a human but yet hyper human character that represented all this guy's frustrations. Fucking genius shit man. You know, especially if you think about the fact that God was writing in the fifties, you know, and then by the time they made it a movie, you know, Arnold Schwarzenegger was like, Damn, dude, why are you so much?

Speaker 4:          01:18:50       That's ridiculous. You know what's, what's the reason for that? That's not cold in Canada there's a tournament is more like a, uh, George St Pierre type build. Did you like to. That's how the gay more like, um, James Irvin's build that would be a good corner, like thick, but it looks like an athlete, you know, like a Herschel Walker. Herschel Walker. How about that motherfucker? Forty seven years old. Dude has his first MMA fight beat to shit ass. I'm young boy. Hershel Walker's 40 fucking seven dude. And he looks like a Goliath. He's still just swole as fucking chiseled and just cut and dudes down. That guy's a suit. That's a super athlete. They should be saving his DNA. I don't know how many kids that guys have. How many kids do you have? Kids have no idea. If he doesn't have kids they need to get the guy shoots him loads into some cops for sure.

Speaker 4:          01:19:41       Right? Don't you think? Get Him. You imagine if you got Herschel Walker and one of the Williams sisters and, and, and they fell in love and I mean, I don't know. No disrespect to her. So I believe he's married and I don't know if the Williams sisters are married. So let's just hypothetically make that and not in the real world is the fake world. Nobody got upset, but I'm saying, you know, you get to super athletes like that and put their genetics together. It'd be incredible. Incredible. Like you ever know who Lucy a riker is lucy a rikers, a female boxer. This chick could punch like harder than men. She was incredible. She was so good. All the other female boxers avoided the fuck out of her. This is back in the Tonya harding days. This chip was like leaps and bounds above other female boxers.

Speaker 4:          01:20:26       She was just a freak athlete, right. I don't remember what nationality she was. I feel like I want to say something, something Latin American or so, but she was from Holland, but I don't remember what her nationality. I'm totally guessing she was a a dark skinned chick, but God damn it was just this fucking freak athlete. Just beat the fuck out of church. She even fought dudes. She got flatline though. She fought a dude and the dude connected. Our John just. She went in [inaudible] 99 and it was weird to see him because she was at attacking. She was trying to cut this dude down and they do just bang and she just flatline, stiffened up and face planted. But it looked like before the flat line, like she was getting the best of the dude. The dude just hit too hard. There's a thing about bone structure.

Speaker 4:          01:21:08       I think, you know, like if you. One of the things, if you meet someone, meet a guy like this, like a big puncher, like I met Michael Moore once. Michael Moore was the boxing heavyweight champion of the world. And uh, he was uh, the light heavyweight champion at one time too, for a long time. It was bad ass as a light heavyweight. I just couldn't keep cutting the way he was too big, but it was like one of the best light heavyweights ever. But he's got like a frame, like, you meet that dude. He's like frame. It's heavy, you know, his fists are heavy shoulders heavy. That's the type of dude when he hits you, it's just, there's so much. There's so much to him, you know what I'm saying? And a check. Even if a chicken is really talented, ultimately they're not built the same way, you know, so it just makes you think like a chick like that, like a Lucier, weicker, you know, matching her up with like an Anderson Silva, some other freak athlete, you know, God damn, I sound like some sort of a genetic engineer.

Speaker 4:          01:22:01       I'm trying to make future warriors. It's going to happen. It is going to kind of be like, well, you know what's going to happen? It's going to happen in a laboratory before it's going to happen with two people having sex. Sex is not going to happen the old fashioned way with the gladiator meets the warrior princess. It's not gonna happen like that. The way it's going to happen now is you know you're going to, someone's going to take the attributes, you're going to get some fat, dumpy dude, you know who's, who's got a little Dick, but he's got a lot of money because he's crazy and he's invested all of his time to learning the stock market and swindling people and he's going to have children that are like psychotic warrior genius offspring because he's going to like manipulate all his shitty genes and it's gonna create some super offspring and wanting to fucking his young wife and killing him coming in.

Speaker 4:          01:22:44       Yeah. Brock Lesnar is Kona. That would be a real conan. Yeah, that's a real cool. And that's exactly what I'm talking about. Like Brock Lesner is like somebody put that up there. Whoever put that up there, we lost her money in Japan. Yeah, yeah. Money. Japan. That's you're correct sir. That's the perfect bill. That's what you talking about. Just a big giant motherfucker doesn't look like a bodybuilder. Looks like a dude. He'll smash you. You know, like the best fighters. I don't want to say all of them, but most of them don't. Look that ripped, you know, I think when you accept George St Pierre, he's fucking chiseled, but like Bj, when he is in as best shape, he still has like a good layer of fat on him. And Bj I think also has thick skin too. I think that's one of the reasons why Bj doesn't cut that easy.

Speaker 4:          01:23:25       You know, nobody, nobody's got a tougher facing in Bj, Bj and will fight like a fire round fucking war and commander, there were a couple of scratches, like it's crazy, you know, I mean, and they just, that he's, he's fucking awesome. Which it is. I mean, he is, but there's something about that dude's genetics, you know, everybody's there. Everybody's got different genetics. So that's one of the most amazing things about life is the variation amongst human beings. I mean, we vary so much more than any other animal. If you look at like the only animal that comes close is dogs and dogs supposedly are like that because we engineered them, which makes you wonder what the fuck made so many people so different because we vary so much. I mean, the, the fact that, uh, uh, Chinese midget could have sex with Shaquille o'neal and make another baby and that baby would look a combination of those two and there's that much variation between pygmies and women from Iceland, you know, in like a muscle tones, ex wife Bridgette Nielsen, that big giant Icelandic Nordic look and check, you know, that, that her and flavor flave they can have babies, you know, and they can.

Speaker 4:          01:24:34       I mean, they're so different. There's so much diversity. There's no other animal like that except dogs, you know, rhinos that looked like rhinos. You know what I'm saying? Some fish look different and they, you get a small mouth bass flux or a large mouth bass. They get crazy to get freaky with it, you know, and you get a hybrid that's possible. Tigers and lions make loggers, but for the most part, man, human beings are. We're the most diverse world, weird fucking species.

Speaker 4:          01:25:02       It's kind of incredible to, when you think about the fact there's so many of us, we think there's so many humans. You would think by now, we'd all be a big fucking blurry mess. It's crazy when you see like countries like Asian countries where almost everyone has a very similar appearance, you know, almost everyone has dark hair. Almost everyone is, you know, within a certain height rates changing. Now I get Japan and making big giant dudes now. Big giant athletic dudes. A lot of them are changing their diet too. I think it has something to do with that. Have you, you motherfucker. What kind of showing running here, man, the phone rang and how dare you. How dare you, you do you do. What does this kind of fish I fuck talk ladies and gentlemen. What does that mean? Or I shouldn't encourage that guy's pocket.

Speaker 4:          01:25:46       Not encouraging him. Joe, talk about Nibiru folks. I'm going to tell you right now and the bureau is not going to save you. Okay? It's not happening. It's not. It's a myth. Not In the beer was a mess. I don't know if the bureaus are true, but there's some. This is something that we have in our head about someone coming down and fixing everything. And uh, I don't think their shit's happening. I think we're looking for daddy to come down and throw down the rescue boat and pull us out of this mess and I think that's why people look at, if you don't know what Nibiru this, there's people that, there's people that believe that there's a planet that's in an elliptical orbit and every 3000, 600 years it travels between Mars and Jupiter travels like very close to earth or between us and Mars rather.

Speaker 4:          01:26:31       And this gigantic huge planet is responsible for many, many catastrophic events in Earth's history. And it's also responsible for these beings called the Annunaki to come from this planet and go on earth and create human beings with genetic engineering. I mean, it's some fascinating shit. It's all from the Sumerian text in the Sumerian texts is the oldest known written language. It's like, it's called uniform and they write it and he's like little weird strokes. And they, the, they're one of the oldest civilizations that we know of. They had the first, uh, astronomy, the first astrology, including they had detailed depictions of the solar system with planets in all the right orbits. They had like Mars and Pluto even had pluto, we didn't know about Pluto until 1970 and they had a drawing of Pluto that was carved into stone or that was rolled into a tablet 6,000 years ago, 5,000 years ago.

Speaker 4:          01:27:29       I mean, it's really, really crazy stuff. And when this guy, Zacharias [inaudible], and this is where it gets controversial because some guys who are scholars who are a language scientists and guys who are archaeologists breaking down ancient languages and trying to figure out the roots of the word, they don't necessarily believe that citizens. Right. And I think that maybe he's leaped leapt to some conclusions and his depictions. Oh, it's, I don't know. I'm, I have no knowledge when it comes to foreign languages. So I don't understand the argument. No. So I, I see it back and forth and I. It's fascinating to me. It's interesting. You can't prove it. Who the fuck knows? But what is interesting is that culture, the Samarian culture is crazy. They had the first, everything, the first mathematics, they had the first use of the wheel. What the fuck bro. Shut you shit off man.

Speaker 4:          01:28:19       How dare you anyway. Who the fuck knows what's more fascinating than this idea of a planet? Because there's not enough evidence that there is another planet, but there is enough evidence that these people, back then 6,000 years ago, had some amazing view of the world. They had some amazing technology they had. They knew about the DNA, the double helix of the DNA that was there. Their signed for medicine. They're signed for pharmacy. They, uh, they drew a caduceus, which they still use today as a sign of medicine. That's crazy shit, man. They, they had all these depictions of a, there was like large people with small people in their labs and the small people had tails. And you know, the, the people that look at these goals, look, this is genetic engineering, the giants they made in the monkey to the, the DNA of the alien. They created this hybrid. Maybe. Maybe they're just drawn a fucking big guy with a monkey on his lap and make the monkey like curious George and looked like a person. You know, what the fuck man, how do you, how can you tell me that? That's exactly what that doesn't mean. It could be like their cartoon. There's their little character. This is the crazy monkey. Looks like a human once asked stupid questions, sit in my lap and that could be it. Right?

Speaker 3:          01:29:30       I forgot what your. I can't bitch. You don't even pay attention to me anymore. He goes so deep into stuff that like halfway through I'm like, alright, this is my brain is I can't even catch up anymore. To be honest with you. Half the time I don't know what I started talking about. By the time I get to the end, what I found is

Speaker 4:          01:29:48       that I'm a conduit, ladies and gentlemen. These thoughts come to me and I just have let a girl that's sort of sounds faggy. That sounds completely factored, but that really is the truth. You know, the better I get at comedy, the more I feel like I'm not really responsible for what I'm doing. It's like I got to just do the work. I got to write and I got to perform enough, but when I get it, when I nail it, whatever it is that when I tuned back into the frequency, whenever it is, I just ride it. It's like it's, it's almost like the easiest thing in the world. It's like it's difficult to maintain. It's you got to maintain your enthusiasm and maintain your writing and maintain your performing, but when you're in that groove, when you lock in and it's the fucking show, it's fun.

Speaker 4:          01:30:27       When that's going on, that's just a ride. You just ride the ride. You're not, you're not doing anything. I don't feel like it's like if I dig a hole in the dirt in the backyard, I feel like I just did something. You know? I started at fucking hole. It sucked every day, but I got to the end. I get this feeling of satisfaction when I got off stage. I never had like a feeling of satisfaction. I always have a feeling of Ooh, that was crazy. Was like our road something. Like I just got off a crazy ride. You know? You don't know. Like I'd be like, wow, that was fun, or that was, that was cool. That was great audience. But I never feel like I just did anything. I always feel like I just wrote a crazy ride, you know, that's what it feels like.

Speaker 4:          01:31:05       Know, it's like you have to do it enough so that you're comfortable enough so that when you get up it's all smooth, you know, and it's all fun. You know, what you're talking about, you know, what you want to say, you know, and you're working on what you want to say all the time so that it's always fresh, so it's always relevant in your mind. So then who's the asm is there and it didn't do zasmine is there, and then the audiences enthusiastic and then you lock to those things together and then you just ride it. Once you get the laugh, start going, you just start writing it so much fun. It's like you're skiing downhill.

Speaker 3:          01:31:37       I think you're going to get a segway on your lap. If you live in mountains, you can be like, oh, I've be to jump off right quick.

Speaker 4:          01:31:49       I had a crazy Jaguar dream last night, man. I had a dream that jaguars big ones. We're trying to break into my house. I'm having very strange apocalyptic dreams lately. No, not, not serious ones because I survived the apocalypse. The retail apocalypse dream who's ever the end had been having dreams pretty much at all lately or ones once. I remember for some reason. Yeah. I get every now and then I get these, the system fails dreams, you know, every now and then like some mad max type shit. Maybe it's just because all these assholes are screaming, the sky is falling. You know, one of the things that's really interesting, I was listening to some recordings of hunter s Thompson speaking at the University of Colorado and it was like 1974 and he was talking about, you know, like the car, which is like supposedly the group of people that control the world, you know, the global bankers, the Bilderberg group, that type of shit.

Speaker 4:          01:32:42       And he was talking about, uh, uh, you know, like what's going on overseas and what the United States is up to and how corrupt the political system is and how it's probably, you know, if it goes this way much longer, the country is going to fall apart, but then you look at it like 30 years later, it's still the same shit. It's still the same shit. It's like, is it getting any worse? Well, there's more people, so it seems to accelerate a little bit because there's more activity, there's more humans, but it all seems to be going along the same lines. You know, and this, the sky is falling crazy shit like really mean what takes something big man. And if it takes something big, you're probably going to be dead anyway. This guy is really gonna be following. It takes like a meteor. We need like a volcano, like yellow stone, which by the way, ready for this. This is January 17th. There's been over 1,600 earthquakes in yellowstone.

Speaker 3:          01:33:32       What the fuck is common? If you don't know yellowstone is a giant volcano. See, nobody ever taught me this in school. They ever teach you this in school. Do you remember this? Yeah. Do you get the Caldera? What would the. The whole volcano thing with then it's going to blow up. I think it's weird when you live there too. It's like a lot of people can't live with it because they're in constant fear of it too. I've heard. How could you not? I forget who it was. I think it was a Adam Corolla or somebody or was talking about when I was in high school. I know. Well I'm older than you. How old you? A $30.

Speaker 4:          01:34:03       Shh. Don't tell these people though. They're cruel from seven. I'm seven years older than you. So you have to think about like if we were in high school, like I was in high school earlier than you. They probably didn't even know yet because one of the things they found out about with these, um, yellowstone is a, they had satellite images and when they took the satellite images, that's when they realized that what they were dealing with was a called era, which was a volcano. That was so explosive that the top literally disappeared, like be like Hawaii, but Hawaii fucking explodes and it's just flat. I mean that's how big this volcano is. It's 300 miles across. That's insane. And when it blows up, you imagine 300 miles of explosion straight up into the air.

Speaker 3:          01:34:47       Everything will be okay here or will be fucked. The whole continent would be fucked. We'd be fucked. But we would have like, like a good, like one hour slow lava or no, it wouldn't be

Speaker 4:          01:34:58       lava. You'd be fucked because the ash wood rat and fuck everything up. It would kill animals. It would. It would pollute the water supply. So what way would fuck everything you think about it? How much it was? It's like heavy, heavy [inaudible] is like snow. Okay. Except it's much heavier. So rooms would collapse. So you would get like, you know, two, three feet of certain that would come down. And even if you stayed inside your house and relax, your house would very likely get crushed from this fucking sit because there's certainly thousands and thousands of pounds on your roof. So it's going to cave your fucking house and you can't breathe outside. The sky is filled with cert you don't understand everywhere and it's heavy, thick shit. Volcanic ash, soot. You're fucked. You're fucked. And it covers the continent. It comes over us. Like I said, the volcano.

Speaker 4:          01:35:49       How long does it. Do you have any? They don't have any idea. Well, they know that there's been smaller ones where it's just killed a lot of things. And then there's been these gigantic earth shattering ones every six to 800,000 years. And the last time there was one with 600,000 years ago. What if it was something like, it wouldn't hit you for like a week and say you just get out and people will segue there going, fuck, would you do. You'd have to leave the continent yet. Well, I think you could be okay if you could get off in North America to Europe. Even if you knew that shit was going down and you could get on a plane and fly to England, just take your family and a crazy movie. A evacuating the whole United States. Well, you know, there's a, there's a rock shelf in Africa, um, that if it breaks off like it's, they have these underwater, uh, these underwater landslides occur with these big shelves of these mountains fall off and it's happened thousands of times throughout history.

Speaker 4:          01:36:46       Well, if this one particular rock flat, this, this whole area which they predict one day we'll break off and go into the, the ocean is one particular side of a mountain. If it does that, it's gonna repeat a gigantic tsunami that engulfs the whole east coast of the United States, like miles in. It's just going to just miles in water. I mean, just a gigantic chunk of raw pouring into the ocean and these fucking waves that are like a mile high. So it's going to roll in wreck everything. It's going to be insane. Or it's just gonna be mildly irritating to be insane. It's going to be insane and it's probably gonna happen. Yeah. You know, it might not happen in our lifetime, but the, but you can't say it was so against it. So not though they probably are. There's so many things, but there's so many things.

Speaker 4:          01:37:35       Do there's so many different things. The odds aren't against it. If you look at all of them together, the odds aren't against it because if you look at like meteors, man, they don't know when the fuck those are coming. They have no idea how many asteroids are out there, how many big chunks of fucking rock and metal and iron are flying through space in any one of those Kojak us and they've happened so many times over history. It's been proven. There's so many planets that are scattered with craters. There's no way we can predict it. There's, I mean they could monitor the sky and hope they catch most of them, but there's always ones that are sneaking right bias that we miss and it's happening left and right man. Well, when you black, what the fuck? That's the government man. Can you guys still hear us well? Let's start recording. Hm? Well, refresh your browser. Refresh that. I don't even know what the fuck we're talking about. This is interrupted math. Hello? Ladies and gentlemen.

Speaker 4:          01:38:36       A long time scale. Everything is inevitable. Yeah, that's, that's, that's really, dude. Just nailed it on the head. That guy money, Japan again, money, Japan for the wind and motherfuckers raise money to have two good quotes. He, if he listened to that one is money, money, money, money. And if you talked to Eddie about being in Japan and how cool it was. No, he just got back last night. I haven't seen him yet. I would love to get to Japan and he, um, he's been to Japan, but though he, when he used to work for pride, what am I in Japan. So yeah, a long time scale. Everything is inevitable. That's what people have to realize. Like we know for sure that human beings have a lifespan. You're going to die as much as you plan for the future. It's where you're going to die. We know that planets have a lifespan as much as you plan for the future.

Speaker 4:          01:39:19       Flagging signs eventually run into energy am I take billions of years, but it's going to happen. And what we have to worry about is not just that, not just earthquakes, not just super volcanoes, not just media. We have to worry about gamma ray explosions. We have to worry about supernovas that happen out in space that make these giant gamma ray bursts and fucking flood the earth. Crushing all our communication systems, crushing off satellites, breaking everything. No wireless Internet, no oprah. Everything shuts the fuck down. I mean, that Shit's all possible. Giant, crazy solar flares. There's a lot of shit that could fuck human beings up. You know, there's a lot of shit, you know, and they say that the polar ice caps have shifted more than once in the past. And they also say that 10,000 years ago, during the last ice age, the North American continent, like half of it was under a mile of ice.

Speaker 4:          01:40:12       I mean, North America was fucked up, dude. It was all ice, you know? I mean, that's crazy shit. That's only 10,000 years ago, man. Crazy things can happen if. How would we stop North America from turning all ice again? If the earth got that cold again, what the fuck would we do? What we do? Turn on the heat. What the fuck would we do? What would we do if all of a sudden North America started turning into a fucking mile high sheet wall of ice? Odds are dinosaurs would come back first. Why? Why do you say that? I don't know why. Listen, Brian, you can't give me. That is what makes. What makes these climate changes is very mysterious. Most likely have nothing to worry about. Maybe. Yes, most likely, but there's been some gigantic things that happened to men at times. I could. I could freak out about that shit or I could just be like, hey, let's talk about real things that are freaking me out.

Speaker 4:          01:41:01       Shit. I gotta pay my bill tomorrow and do this tomorrow. And I think people avoided though. I think people. It's not just the fact that people choose not to think about it. I think they typically avoid it so they don't ever have to think about like the, the, the real, the real big picture. The real big picture is very frightening to a lot of people. And now there's the big picture. Like what are you gonna do with your life and you know you're going to get married, you're going to have kids going to get a good job, you're gonna. Be Able to put your kids through college. That's the, that's the real picture. And then the big picture and the big picture is what the fuck are we doing? You know, we're involved in two wars. It's 2010. This is the age of information we see everywhere that were being fucked left and right.

Speaker 4:          01:41:38       You know that your bailout money is going to these corporations, the corporation ceos are taking hundreds of millions of dollars in payouts for bonuses and all this insanity and you're like, what fucking bonus like that. They used the United States tax payers money to bail out the company and now they get to get money. They get bonuses, big giant checks for what? For fucking up. Like what kind of a criminal organization is this and we're accepting it. What the fuck is this country running under? That's part a of the big picture. And then part b of that picture is what the fuck we're in space. That's, that's the crazy one. The Part B is we are, we are on a planet and this planet is one of an infinite amount of planets and an infinite amount of solar systems and an infinite amount of galaxies spread throughout an infinite amount of space and that space and the universe itself may be some sort of a geometric pattern.

Speaker 4:          01:42:33       That model is get on this face thing. Well, that's the most amazing thing. I do always get on the space now, but it's because I get on those space thing in life. When I think about, when I think about life, when I think about anything or I think about, you know, Obama talking about gays in the military, we must repeal, don't ask, don't tell. Finally Gay people go to die too. Like this is nuts. Like who the fuck wants to be in the military now at this point in time, they're saying to them, you know, like, oh look, okay, we need gay people. Let's just be cool about this. Gay people were running out of people who want to join the military. Let's get some gay people in it too, right? You know, the military, I think in our, our grandparent's era, you know, I think they were, you know, they were at least less under the illusion that they were getting fucked.

Speaker 4:          01:43:18       You know this, I've talked to so many dudes that come back and are so disillusioned. You know, that Pat Tillman Guy, that's the best example ever. There's a dude who's a NFL football star who decides that he wants to go fight for his country. The nopal list of virtues. You know, for a man to want to represent his country in a time of need to realize that he has to step up. That there are certain times in history where men have to do things and fuck all the glory for being an nfl player. He's going to do the right thing and fight for his country and he goes over there and gets killed in friendly fire, accidentally gets Kennedy quick, make it work.

Speaker 4:          01:43:52       Crazy thing was how quickly he was talking about how fucked up it is over there and how disillusion he is and how it's a mess and his brothers talking about it and they completely incompetent and he was talking about how just completely unorganized it is over there and, and chaotic and how he didn't believe in what he, what he joined up for the army in the first place. It was, he was being tracked and that's not what it was. And it was fascinating, fascinating fucking story, you know, and that represents everything that's best about America. Like a guy who is willing to look at it and say, man, I need to fucking do something. Fuck all his football plan. I'm going to go over there. I want to make a difference. And then when he gets there, he's man enough to go, oh shit, this is a mess. Like this is not what I wanted. I'm not gonna. I'm not going to be United States. This bitch over there. So this is craziness. This is chaos. And then

Speaker 1:          01:44:38       he's dead.

Speaker 4:          01:44:41       Which is what happens, man. You know, you got to fucking war people died. It's terrible, but it's just at this point in time, man, you know, there's gotta be better ways around this. There's gotta be better ways to and I don't know what the fuck they are.

Speaker 1:          01:44:56       What are you doing with that shit back? So we could see each other. I want to read the fucking truck, man. They'll be going on TMZ, you know, but I'm looking at yours so I don't do like that. So we don't look at two totally different things that are a couple of weird geeks. What about the ether? Who's doing the either? That was a good Nazan I'm getting into Nas again lately. Nice to move on, man. You should listen to a kid. Cuddy? No, there's some good. There's some good music. I Hate Nizam. I've overheard too much of his stuff now. Oh, don't be a bitch. She don't get sick of the same music or I do, but I liked. I liked going back to it on occasion. Yeah. Yeah. I tried to listen to Nas recently, but it was like, how dare you. Kate cuddy though.

Speaker 1:          01:45:39       I recommend kid cuddie kid cutting. What does kid cuddy do? This kid cutting smooth little wrapper. Okay. This is the song. Whenever I travel, this is the move he eat a cookie like right before you get to the airport. So then any board, you're not riding dirty. You have to worry about anybody arrested him. He doesn't even kick in until like an hour into the flight, you know, an hour into the flight, Dan Daniel barbecued, and then that's the best way to fly. I mean suddenly you're operating heavy machinery or you're going to think about yourself. You're going to think about life. You can think about a lot of deep, important shit when you're high on an airplane. That's the only way I travel. This is the best way to do it, but then when I land, every time I land Atlanta this song, think about yourself. You've got to think a little deeper. Let's. Woops. That's me. There's a delay. I don't want to listen to that.

Speaker 2:          01:46:33       This hip hop is dead song by now. This is the best barbecue. Contemplating your role, overseeing all these different characters. Walking through the airport, Dr Dre headphones on and I get it down before I don't like this, but I've heard it a million times. Shit, same shit over and over like new music. This is the God damn

Speaker 1:          01:47:10       classic. Look at this thing. It's like Nirvana would be the. Somebody tells me what the fuck is wrong with ustream? Ustream, get it together. People. I know you're free. This shit is wack. Can I read this social stream? Yes. Ryan. L Egg 10. I can. But uh, here's the deal son. We've got to keep this bitch flowing and sometimes we're going to look at what you have to say and sometimes we're not know. There's no rhyme or reason. Don't get crazy. Don't spam. Let the universe that the University of guide

Speaker 1:          01:47:47       just went down a notch in my book jamming to that. The other side I like to listen to in all fairness, is Jimi Hendrix. Voodoo child. That's another bad ass landing song. I used to have. That one is my main one. I would land and listen to what the other one is a little gay. Tori Amos, crucify. I liked that song, that song. I like it landed in the Tori Amos House. Heavy. Her playing the piano. Oh, sexy on white sheets. Like sheets. She's white. I get to see you in your car with your a fanny pack and pack on blasting out the Tori Amos. Most of the time I don't drive in my fanny pack on. The only time I do is when I'm on the way to the airport.

Speaker 1:          01:48:38       People like give the fanny pack a hard time. Matt Serra. I saw you on your, your video blog, which is fucking hilarious. Leading up to this week's UFC and I'm very much looking for do you fight with frank trigg? But I saw you coming down with a fanny pack, my brother and you got to let it go. Not Wrong with fanny pack. Okay. Y'All reason there is something wrong with a fanny pack is because you know you can't get laid if you wear a fanny pack. So who gives a fuck? Anybody that want to fuck you because you wear a fanny pack, you don't want them. That's what I have to say. That's a functional piece of wardrobe. It's excellent. You fucking strap that bitch on right there and you've got all your shit right here. It's nice. It's right there. You go to the airport and you take it off.

Speaker 1:          01:49:16       Bam. You walked through the metal detector. Not saying you have to wear it every day, but if I were it, fuck you man. Fuck you. I got a fanny pack on boy. That shit on stage before people get all angry. I think it's a prop. You sent a proud. This is my fanny pack bench. It seems like it would be a prop. Yeah, because it's very unstylish, but guess what I'm. The reality is I'm a 42 year old married dude with a, with a family trying to come at you trying to cover. You're not trying to fuck you. I'm trying to walk into the airport which is trying to cover your hog. I'm Daniel. We're gonna. Have to pull that

Speaker 4:          01:49:49       fanny packs. Haida bone or really well now my bone or bitch. Maybe your boner. Maybe. I guess maybe maybe it would hurt if you had like a cell phone digging into your deck as I like more of like a little backpack slingbox. It's very rare that I walk with boners anymore though was when I was a younger man. Boners like, you know, walking through the airport for some reason. Just got this random boner cooking that don't get those random boaters anymore. I get morning loners but I'll get no random daytime boners. Especially if I do a lot of Jujitsu and that's mixed Jujitsu. Sound very gay because it kills your boner I guess I never was. There'll be do a lot of Jujitsu. You're tired all the time. Your testosterone's down, you know you're worn out and if you get laid all the time, do those two things. Keep your bonus from just occurring randomly. But if you're not getting laid and you're not even working out, you're not doing anything, your bonus would just start firing away.

Speaker 5:          01:50:45       It's fuck who fucked bro. If you're not paying attention,

Speaker 4:          01:50:54       have, you know, given your dick the proper maintenance work. And you know, I had a joke that was in one of my cds from way back, I don't remember which one, I think it was shiny happy Jihad. It was a day you got to jerk off first and then think about what you're doing. You should always do that. It's really important because your biology will trick you. Your biology will have you convinced that you should go file some crazy girl home, live in a bad neighborhood and leave your car on the, on the corner and her cousin's going to watch it. Like, why? Because you're Horny, you know, you'll do some dumb shit. You'll do some silly shit, you know? And if you jerk off, you're much less likely to do any of that. Keep every play racquetball. No. That's the funny thing you say that because I was just at a gym the other day that had all these racquetball courts and I was like, that was one of the first times I've ever seen racquetball and I was reading a long time. Now

Speaker 5:          01:51:36       you would seem like a scary racket ball partner. You'd be one of those,

Speaker 4:          01:51:42       man, this is why I don't like my racquetball. I've had two knee surgeries. Yeah, yeah. I bet both of my acl reconstructed and my had another a meniscus surgery on my left knee and they work great. Now I'm like, I have no problem doing Jujitsu and it's their fun and it's fine, but I think if I did stuff like that, like cutting back and forth all the time, you run the risk of injuring yourself, you know, Jujitsu. I can kinda control the movements a little bit more. Especially if you pulled guard and he, you know, he control where your legs are going. You know when you're going back and forth like that, you're putting a tremendous amount of pressure on your joints and your explosive movement like that. It's really, it's like, you know, it's, it's an interesting thing to watch athletically, but like for your body eventually that Shit's going to where the fuck out of, you know, you know, what's the craziest thing, man?

Speaker 4:          01:52:28       So you see like old football players, man, you got to respect the fucking dedication that goes into that sport. The amount of pain those guys have to deal with. Those guys get fucking clipped. You know what I mean? Some fucking football games that you see, like we see the clips on youtube where dudes are running full steam and just right into another dude and send him smashing into the ground and another guy fucking piles into it. At the same time you're watching. You just go, Jesus Christ, your body, your fucking bond. Just gonna get mangled. And some of these guys like wanting back. So like not that big dudes. You know these big fucking gorilla. You're trying to get at them. Wooo. Football's a crazy ass game man. You know when football will be the shit when they can fix any injury, anything they have, anything that happens, they just zap you and it's like they have apple backup for your hard drive.

Speaker 4:          01:53:25       That's all we have for your life right before you go in and do anything dangerous. They back up your life, you know, like a couple of weeks ago, and then they reload your back into the grid. Like, oh, I'm back. Did you die? Die, die, dude, I fucked up. You know I got crazy. You know, how crazy would that be? I mean, look, if you believe in like Ray Kurtzweil and these futurists that believed that one day we're going to be able to download consciousness into a computer, I mean at a certain point in time it becomes. The real question becomes what is reality? Then if your downloaded into a computer who keeps the computer on the computers, keep the computers on, and then we're part of this new life, this new world that exists inside of Huc and machine, and then your consciousness exists in a machine and what happens to the original version of your consciousness?

Speaker 4:          01:54:06       What does guy I have planned for you? After you die? Do you really go into some great well of souls and you know, and go to the next stage of existence. Does that happen? And if that does happen and you're already downloaded into the machine, does the well of souls except you or the wellstone goes, listen bitch, I don't accept software piracy up in heaven. He can't be copying my shit and put it on bit torrent down on earth and have it all these, you know. C'Mon man, you're time's up, bitch. It's over. You have to move on. You know, maybe it doesn't accept you if there's a version of you running this parallel dimension, maybe having one except you because you gotta you gotta let go. But that's the whole idea of living and dying is to know that this is a stage. Don't be greedy.

Speaker 4:          01:54:42       Don't try to live for a thousand years. Just get the fuck out of here. Go, go, go, go. Don't download yourself. Not makes you know, it's almost like a kid who wants to go down the slide and he's holding onto the back of the slide and he wants to go down the slide and hold on at the same time. Well you can't. Did he go down a slide or you hold on, you'd be a bitch. So either downloads or something, a computer live forever or you see what's next. Like, like you're supposed to write. Aubrey de Grey believes we will live forever in biological form. Yeah, I've seen that guy, that professor Aubrey de Grey Day sleeper in 1988. He's that crazy English dude with the big long crazy beard who drinks a lot of beer. Yeah, he's a fascinating guy. He's a, um, you know, some crazy, mad scientist, genius character who is working on a changing human beings at the molecular level level to, uh, to prevent aging, the change agent and working all these different science for our anti aging. And the idea is that if you can survive for a few years, the next 20, 30 years, so you're

Speaker 1:          01:55:44       likely that you could live forever, which is really crazy. It's just insane to think about like so many people as it is right now, you know? Did you see Pandora them by the way? Unsolicited plug here. Hold on a second.

Speaker 2:          01:55:59       I'm going to grab this.

Speaker 1:          01:56:07       I watched this the other night on Blu Ray. It's called Pandora them. And this is a movie that a con Lee is in. And that's, I think how I found out about it the first time. And then a dude named angry Amadeus on my message board made a post about it and he's a pretty smart guy and he was talking about how great it was. I said, all right, fuck it. I'll give it a try. Like, okay. As an intelligent dude. And it's a, a space horror film and a Conley, isn't it? Dennis Quaid is in it and pretty God damn fucking good movie man. What is it? Pretty Fun fucking movie. It's a horror movie and space. Kind of surprised that it didn't get more people into it. It was good. What's the rotten tomatoes score? I didn't even look. Let's look. The rotten tomatoes score for Pandora. I pretty much trust that shit. Rotten tomatoes. Yeah, it's pretty good. It's pretty accurate. Usually. What do I think about the nexus one? I think it's got a lot of problems now, but once it comes to verizon, it might be interesting to see what happens.

Speaker 1:          01:57:08       I'm kind of more excited about the tour to now. I think what the thing about the tour too, which means a lot to me, is that, uh, it's a world phone. I need a world hot travel bitch. I'm international and was saying sometimes I'll be visiting my homies in the UK, Twenty eight percent tomatoes, 28 percent damn consensus. While my approve somewhat satisfying for devout Scifi fans. Pandora was bloated. Derivative plot an ultimately leaves it drifting in space. Okay. I completely disagree. Yes. It was not perfect, nor was avatar. I'm not looking for perfect movies anymore. I'm looking for an escape. I'm looking for some fun. If I want to be intellectually stimulated, it's not going to be from your gay fucking movie. Okay. It's going to be from a documentary is going to be from some real life shit. It's going to be from something on space. If I'm watching a movie, I want crazy shit with monsters and explosions. I don't want to excitement and I want some tits and that movie had all that click on top critics and read some of the bitch was kicking everyone's ass. Top critics. Yeah. And then read some of just little blurbs from what their reviews are because I'm kind of interested to see if. Because if you'd like it so much, what they have to say about it.

Speaker 2:          01:58:21       Hm.

Speaker 1:          01:58:23       Throughout some obvious questions pop up immediately. Yeah, no kidding. Jesus Christ folks. Lazy. Derivative. Perhaps. Perhaps a bit, but. So what, man? It's like a fucking cheeseburger. Tori Amos in soundtrack. How dare.

Speaker 4:          01:58:43       Listen folks. Yeah, it's. You know what? I'm looking forward to the wolf man. Okay. The wolf man with Benicio del Toro's coming out. I know the fucking plot. I know it's been done a thousand times before. I don't give a shit. I want some escape. I want to see the wolf man. I want to see like it's an old school. Wolf men too. It's going to be bad. And you like the old ones? Yeah, I loved all of them. Dude. I loved American Werewolf in London. I loved the old wolf man. I'd love. There's so many different ones that came out. You know, there hasn't been a good one in a long time though. Those likened movies, the vampires and the fucking. Those are cool looking werewolves. They're kind of crazy looking, but they're so CGI that's. It's hard to take them serious. They look dope, but they look fake as fuck, you know?

Speaker 4:          01:59:27       Anyway, a lot of people felt that movie sucked and you might think it sucks to be a huge team wolf fan. No, but I like some science fiction. I love horror and science fiction movies, aliens like that kind of old school aliens. Now. This was one that was like that, that I hadn't seen, so it was fun, man. I'll watch that shit again. I liked it. I liked that. I liked to stupid shit. Stupid Shit is not always bad folks. It's like what I was saying about cheeseburgers. Sometimes you want a fucking hot dog. Sometimes you need to gourmet meal and you want to have a nice healthy salad first and we'll have spring water with lemon in it. You want to feel good about yourself. You want to feel sometimes you want to fucking hot dog and you want a hot dog with Chili on it.

Speaker 4:          02:00:04       All right, and that Shit's good when you want it. It's good. He notes pig ass holes and the horse dicks. You don't give a fuck if it tastes good. And when we got sauerkraut in it and mustard, that's what this fucking movie. I live by a wiener Schnitzel. And have you ever been there? I think so. It's amazing. It's pretty much whatever you want. They a chicken corn dog hot dogs. Oh yeah. I think I went to one in Colorado actually. That was one of the first ones I went to. Corn beef. Hot Dog. That's great.

Speaker 4:          02:00:33       Unoriginal plot like Carlsbad Sia. How dare you, your Momma while you were doing so well before the. Let's not bring up that full red band. Doesn't like old music. Oh, I do like music. You don't know what you're talking about frank over there. Shit, Bro. I Love Beatles. Mostly Beatles with my favorite zipline is probably my second favorite old school. Old Music. Yeah. To hold out a love is one of my favorite songs of all time. There was something about the seventies man, they had a certain sixties and the seventies. They had a certain energy to their music that like what was representing the changes that were going on in the culture that we haven't had in a long time. Like the thing about Jimi Hendrix and the thing about the doors and the Beatles and all the zipline, the bands from that era is like they really were, they, they were bursting onto the scene in one of the most, the one of the biggest changes and in our human culture ever, like between the fifties in the seventies, shit just went haywire and whacked out of fucking control and all of a sudden there's, you know, love power and stop the war and everyone's doing acid and Ken Keasy and the fucking Mary Pranksters and they're all doing acid and hanging out with fucking Timothy leary and Hunter Thompson and everyone's trying to change the world and everybody's fucking.

Speaker 4:          02:01:46       Everybody left and wide. And Jimi Hendrix is onstage this jam into his guitar doing the Star spangled banner with his fucking guitars, the craziest version of it ever. And his dirty hippies on acid wallowing in the mud in front of them. I mean, there was nothing like it. There was nothing like it before. It changed the culture, you know, so that music, when I listened to it, man, I feel that shit in it. When I listened to like some old Hendrix or some stones from that error, so like you feel the fucking, the time you feel that era, you know, it's like imprinted in the really great art of that era. Like voodoo child, you know, like so many fucking songs. Mother's little helper, you know, so many stones, songs, brown sugar. Come on man. Digital underground. What you just ruined. I didn't even know what you're talking about because they were good to.

Speaker 4:          02:02:40       Digital underground was good when they first came in. You know what else was good man? Um, who does opp naughty by nature. Naughty by nature. Was young and used to be the shit. Yeah, but naughty by nature. Yes. But I, I liked young Mc a couple of songs but naughty by nature. What I liked about them was that dude's flow was so original. Third Base, you know, they couldn't fuck with that dude. Treach had that, that rhythmic flow that was like, he made all the words Ryan cool. But he also did it almost like he was singing, like he was talking shit and singing at the same time and doing it really fast to show you that he's good at it, you know? I mean he was like way more skilled than most of those guys. Like way more transitions and wait craftier, you know when you have it with that duty to do know that you dealt with LPP.

Speaker 4:          02:03:29       That was a great fucking song. That was a great. That's a perfect example. That song I overcame, I never went and listened to that song and now I could probably listen to it. Yeah, I know what you mean. Like back then after awhile it got to the radio and you're like, Jesus Christ. It's like the poker face on it. That's like enough enough Nwa, express yourself, express full capabilities in the correctional facilities because some don't agree with how I do this. A good straightened meditate like this. Yeah. That shit was a revolution in the morning just in black and what it was freaking me out. I first got into Nwa, had heard about Nwa, like a little late to the game, and this is back when I was still fighting and I was on the treadmill doing my workout and I had a Walkman on. It was a walkman back then, a cassette one and I was listening to it. I think I've met a bit a CD player. I don't know. It definitely wasn't an MP. Three player. He might've been a CD player, I can't recall, but I remember listening to, I think it was a cassette. I remember listening to it and go, God, these guys are so mean. Like they're all like anti white people and white bitch and white. This what they want to shoot people like, wow, this is crazy. It's a must have the music. And I started getting into like

Speaker 1:          02:04:38       ghetto boys and shit. It's all people want to kill people. Ice Tea. I know there was nothing before that. You know, like the, the rockstars of like the sixties and the seventies. Nobody ever talked about killing anybody. Then all sudden in the eight, all these rappers are killing people. Colors see nightmare walking. Psychopath talking, let's get butt naked and fuck tonight. Yeah, that was like later stuff, but the early stuff that he came out with. Yeah. H U s t l e member. What's the two live crew? I used to listen to like two live crew and it's weird. Like I grew up listening to black people talk about sex like nasty. They're freaking were put in to live greener jail for being too dirty. It was so dirty. They want to lock them in cages and they did it. You know? That's how crazy Florida is in Florida. You can get oxycontin's everywhere you turn. You can go to a store, you know right next to a fucking apartment building and they go to pain management center and you go these pain management center. There's always oxycotton junkies who's sitting around wanting to get their shit. That's okay, but you can't have a black guy talking about get his dick sucked, you know what is that?

Speaker 1:          02:05:55       We're terrified of that. Stopped doing it because I want to read the Stream. Faggot. Why do you keep fucking on trying to read what people have to say? Public enemy minus flavor, flave don't hate on flavor flavor just because you got paid tornado flavor because he figured out a way to turn his eccentricities into a show. Kool g rap, Kool g rap and Dj Polo. Fuck yeah. The Beatles or the stones? Depends on the mood or what do you think? Beatles or stones.

Speaker 1:          02:06:23       Beatles million really well. The beaters were definitely the stones too much. You know who I really liked? Man, that I don't think got enough credit with soundgarden. I think soundgarden, soundgarden, soundgarden. Just blow up the outside world. I'm sorry man. That's one of the greatest. Tap on that dog. Temple of the dog was great, but blow up the outside world that just that song alone. That's one of the greatest songs ever. Man. They had some really creative fucking songs and Chris Cornell, his voice just worked so well with that band. You know this other shit that he's been doing. I'm not really into it. Yeah. I can't get into it at all, but God damn. He was awesome with soundgarden. You know his new shit that he did like the the pop shit like, oh, maybe I give the guy a chance once. Fuck around. People don't know.

Speaker 1:          02:07:08       Sometimes you take chances. You don't want to fuck you. Doing that new gorilla is awful. Is it? God? They were so good. They knew it's because it has like this guy screaming, bluesy, jazzy type stuff in it. I don't know. It's pretty good. The first time I made out with a chick I listen to the comfortably numb like pink floyd. I was watching wwf, number two, the basement of my friend's house. The first time I read steps, wf number two, whatever used to be called. Which one was that? I don't remember, but it was on the TV and it was first time I ran wrestling, wrestling. Wwe. You were progressing while progressing was on. Wow. Did she make like a little muffled? I don't remember. I don't remember when you get too loud so nobody could hear some weird. I don't remember now because it was like after homecoming and my friend was upstairs having sex on the family were just jamming it so nobody was home.

Speaker 1:          02:08:03       Exactly. So then you put on a show. You're trying to try to make your friends here. How loud you right. I did it. I don't think I did macro around shit. Fuck up. It's soccer, but let them know you're doing crazy shit down there so they feel uncomfortable. If I didn't, I don't remember it. Trying to do that and try to kill your friends. Boner just by over over freaking. No. The room down the hall. No, no. I'm a quiet sex man. You got a gorilla? Fuck them. Every now and then dude. You probably Purim and everything while you're having sex. I'm quiet man. Style. I drove into a pillow, a lot of rape jokes, a lot, a lot of positional dominance. I'm very good at guard passing. I don't know what the fuck I'm doing. Guard passing shit.

Speaker 1:          02:08:47       It's funny how you know you can date one girl and think that like it's cool to choke girls because that's what they want. Jumping and jumping and like what? They don't like that at all. I don't like that. That's confusing that you don't want that. That was sacked. Yeah. Or He loves that. He likes smacking girls too, but as long so I can see them in real life now. Like slapping him when he's bone them. I don't, I don't want to connect those two things together. Violence and sex. I don't because I think you can connect things in your head. You can set up a little pathways and like it or not, they're in there. You know? I think sometimes dudes get obsessed with feet. You don't know what the fuck was that all about, but it's a thing and dudes get horny and excited about feet.

Speaker 1:          02:09:28       Well, that same shit can happen with slapping people. Dunkin likes to be spanked and you could date a girl and she likes you to slap her and then you get into that and you, you guys have logo sex because you're slapping and fucking in the ass and she's nutty and then you know, that's your shit now. Like you're all fired up and the next year you try to slap her and fuck her in the ass and she's like, you fucking piece of shit and you ruined like the best relationship ever. Why? Because you're addicted to ask fucking and slap and bitches and that's just wrong man. I need to get your shit together. It's funny how different every girl is to. Some of us want to be fucking. Other guys are like, why are you doing it so rough? You know, some girls, they want you to look at their clit like this. All right? They want you to go like this. And the other girls who want you to fucking shake your head. Like, I want you to punch it. They want to get crazy with it. Then asshole, they want to go nutty. You know, some girls want, didn't want the whole thing, didn't want fingers. They want you to fuck their face. They want money. Shit. But if you try that with other girls, you got problems son. That's why I just let them take control. Sometimes you got to take a chance. Sometimes you got to roll

Speaker 4:          02:10:34       the dice, but you got to know how how freaky girl is at. Some girls would have never done it before, but you just tried it and then all of a sudden you parties on. I would recommend as men have experience in it in his elder years. Don't get all excited about that ass fucking. That shit is not sanitary. It's not good for anybody. It's only. It's only. It doesn't feel better. It's just because it's taboo. That's Nettie. That's the trick and it's unsanitary and you could ruin your wife's butthole. Right? You'll break that shit. They're all going to have problems shitting with like 20 years when they get old dudes who are gay, a lot of gay dudes just go with the blow job, a blow job jerking each other off. They give up. Yeah. A lot of gay dudes. They're like, you don't target your asshole pounded some big Dick.

Speaker 4:          02:11:14       Lexington steel type character. Ripping your asshole part. You know, and there's a lot of that online. We were talking about that, about how easy it is to see porn online. Like ass fuck porn. Pam. Like within a couple clicks, you know, I'm all you have to do is just put it in your google, go to a site and it's free. You just pay a lot of money for like little shitty ass tiny videos that you can download online or in magazines or sears catalogs, but mean the porn. Just the evolution of porn over the last few years. I mean now you've got like these youporn science and you know, pornhub meet your giant big pictures. I mean it's a giant big image and it's high quality and it's free. Like how the fuck are they able to do that? Who's, how is everybody getting paid? Like how's that work?

Speaker 4:          02:11:57       And if that's happening, who the fuck is buying porn these days? There's any. I mean what, how down to their sales, if anybody needs a bailout horn and period is down, there's no reason for pointing. People have moved on. Were people in with webcams are now giving it for free on their facebook page. I've always said about porn. Why would you need to make more porns? They have. There's like billions of points you couldn't possibly have jerked off to all of them. It's not even possible. There's so many, unless you're so goddamn specific, you know the like you follow one girl and you know, it's a fantasy adventure. Porn, it's all acted out as long. Only three fuck scenes in the whole hour and a half movie, but there's a lot of bad acting. There's dudes who are into those, you know, they follow like one particular porn starting to get into it and get obsessed by her and go to meet her at the Avn awards and sign autographs with them.

Speaker 4:          02:12:40       You know, some dudes just lock onto one chip, but if it's just, you're just looking to jerk off to stuff. You don't have to ever make new porns there's plenty of points. Nobody's seen them all. It's impossible. How many points are there? Do you know? Twitter verse. Anybody have any idea? Yeah, it's a lot of these porn stars that moved onto just paying per like live like this kind of web streaming. Like, you rent them for an hour and you tell them, you're like, all right, I want you to put this into your butthole and that's a good move. She probably do the one on how much I can get something. My buddle. Um, what was I talking about? Oh, D, I'm tyler night. There's a dude who was a porn star. His name was tyler and I played, uh, um, uh, who was in the, uh, the bill cosby one that bill cosby porn that I'm Thomas Thomas Award was in Thomas Ward. Played Cosby, right? They did a porno up and he's a real cool dude. He's just

Speaker 1:          02:13:31       a, he's just porn actor who, uh, is also a really good writer. He's got this grant, I don't know his blog title unfortunately, but, uh, he's uh, no one, I'm going to find it for you because he's really write some crazy shit, but he's a really cool dude and he does a Jujitsu with us at 10th Planet Jujitsu in Hollywood. Yeah. He's a really tough guy too. He boxed. He had a boxing match and Mario Lopez, but Mario made them things on them. Mario gave him a bed, not a beating, but he beat him. I shouldn't say that. Let me follow up. Tyler Lopez fight a lot. Uh, I think he has fought a bunch of times. He's a tough dude, man. He likes to box and he's really athletic and he's really good at it. He's um.

Speaker 2:          02:14:15       Oh, here we go. Tyler night.com.

Speaker 1:          02:14:22       Yeah. You already have that in your bookmarks. I don't. He's my buddy man. Don't be gay. All right, I'm going to book here. Check out our blog.

Speaker 2:          02:14:36       Hold on. Start again.

Speaker 1:          02:14:38       It's really interesting stories because he's a porn star, but he's a really intelligent dude and uh, a good writer and a really fucking cool guy. I'd go really nice. Guy. Board is not accepting new people to register. It's not that somebody just tweeted. No, it is. I'll accept people. You just got to give me a day or two. I do it myself because I don't want anybody getting crazy.

Speaker 2:          02:15:01       I don't want to keep track of this whole thing. I'm going to follow him. Follow night. My,

Speaker 1:          02:15:11       my large penis friends. I haven't seen his car. All right here go. So hold on

Speaker 1:          02:15:27       when steam, how dare you. We're just getting started soon, right? That's it. That's our next thing. We're going to just a few more questions and then we're gonna get it. I haven't been doing it for two hours man. So we've been doing it for two hours. No, I'm just saying I'm just ran out of steam. Watch such great heights. What are you talking about, son? Oh, the video, the porno video. Um, I'm sure you can, you porn or something? Those fucking things are everywhere. What I want to know about these things, about these, um, you porns is how they make money and how to make money now. I mean are a lot of people that are doing that. A lot of people that are there, they still like filming things and paying for them.

Speaker 1:          02:16:06       Yeah, I think right now it's things like the cosby show type porn stuff where it has to be like a gag gift on those types of wonder man because they're still filming a lot of them. Derek always working. I wonder where. I mean maybe I'm websites are eventually going to start sponsoring their own porn, you know? Well that's what I was saying. Most porn stars have gone to doing their own web cam type thing. But what I meant was websites getting exclusive content deals with porn stars of film in their own porns, you know, and like people get to ride in suggestions, you know, hey, I want to watch Jessie James Suck. Lexington steals deck on a boat when a Japanese Samurai outfit and then okay, we're gonna film that they filmed it and put it online and pay for it. There's no reason to pay for it, but you wouldn't pay for it.

Speaker 1:          02:16:48       But if you felt like you were creating it, you know, maybe it's like one of those builders shoe websites. We could put your own purple stripe on your. If you go to use dream at night, you can find the same shit for free man. There's a whole website devoted ab dishes. The future. How about this? Maybe the future is people will fuck live in front of you. You can tell them what to do. Yeah, but they already do that though. Know what I mean? Like hot checks. Oh yeah. I mean there's pretty good high. There's a lot of websites that do sit in front of the TV, sit in front of the laptop and then you go and suck his cock. It happens all the time and it happens every day. Yeah. That's been happening for a long time. There used to be thing whatever that are dirty pervert I'll talk. Is that it's all piled talk is it's people having sex going like there's people that like people to watch them have sex and people are just sitting there like, Oh, do it in your book, and then they do that. Yeah. That's been happening since like, Hey, well I'll talk. That's the problem with having. It's not even on pal talk. I don't think anymore to cut it out. It's on everything now. It's on ustream. It's on Justin TV. It's not. There's actually links. There's somebody posted a couple of weeks ago to watch people from.

Speaker 1:          02:17:54       What is it about about [inaudible] that's so private? You know, it's funny. It's like we want to do it so badly. Everybody lives for it. We all acknowledge that we all live for it, but if anybody catches you doing it, anybody catches you. Engaging in that sort of pleasure. It's so intimate and revealing about you. It's like we're so terrified of revealing things about ourselves and that's the big one is people seeing you fuck people seeing, you know, you suck someone's pussy. People seeing fuck, some girl never sucked a dick. All crazy. That's craziness. You know, there's something about that that people, people associate that with like almost like madness. You know, like the people that are willing to like watch standing there while people watch them fuck. Like wow, they're crazy. Too crazy. Like they can just take it, just do it. Perform in front everybody like dudes get creeped out by it.

Speaker 1:          02:18:36       If a guy, if you're at a party and everybody's having a good time, it's over your house and this dude just goes crazy and pulses to accountants, girl started soccer at your party, you're going to like be uncomfortable. He couldn't be nervous, right? Why is that? If because if, if he had only anonymous Nag, it's like, Ugh, that was killing me and his girlfriend was like massaging them while you guys were all talking. That will be cool. Like, oh, we're having a nice conversation. Everything's cool. She just making him feel better, but if she's like, oh, I'm going to suck my dick real quick. Well, how come everybody can't go? Okay. He's getting uploaded. I right there in front of us. Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, whoa. No. Everybody gets like really freaked out because it feels too good. It's like the background feels good but sucking your Dick. It's just too crazy. Just kind of sticking them out for everybody. You know some about that. Right? It's weird. Closer. Weird too. It's almost like clothes and covering. You're covering, you're pushing. It's like just somehow or another

Speaker 4:          02:19:28       we've intellectualize that not only do we have to survive and all these different climates and we have to, you know, make sure that we have some stuff to cover us and keep us warm, but we also got to slow the fuck down. Make it tougher to fuck. It can't just be like right there, it can't just be dicks hanging out, pussy taken out because we're just gonna fuck. You could just going to make too many people. Even in hot weather. It's totally unacceptable to walk around naked everywhere and just start fucking people at the supermarket that. But that's what would happen if everybody was naked. If you lived in Florida when it's 110 degrees, you don't have to wear fucking clothes. Okay? And if there was no laws against wearing clothes, people just started walking around naked. People would fuck everywhere. They'd be fucking in bushes and trees that fuck in the car. There'd be checks sucking guys. Dicks while they were driving. Everywhere you looked, it would be going on. It will be everywhere. You'll be way more crashes from getting your Dick sucked dry and then it would be from twittering or from texting

Speaker 3:          02:20:17       or it might be the exact opposite and you're seeing people's floppy tate's everywhere. You're like, oh look, these floppy tits everywhere. I can't see this floppy tip for about a day, and then you're gonna want to get your dick sucked. Right? Trust me, trust me. Alright, you're gonna. You're gonna fucking starbucks. And I'm like, Oh God, everyone's shits everywhere. Yeah, maybe you can handle it. Maybe it's because the dude right next to a giant snake dick or no fucking this white bowman's math. Well, you're trying to. Julia Latte can take one 80 year old lady tits to ruin my whole day to say that, but if Jessica beals naked fingering herself right next to that 80 year old lady, you'll snap out of it and they forget about that old lady. Jennifer has a hairy ass. Hello? And it's a razor and I got some free time.

Speaker 4:          02:21:05       I don't care if she's got to hear about it all getting there. Oh No, I'll clean it all up. I'll Polish it down a buffet. I put cream on it. Whatever she wants, whatever. I got a shaver. That's it. That's kind of a weird thing that all women agree. That hair is gross. It's like this is what we look like. God Damn it. Okay. We grow hair. We go. I mean, some women like this kind of shit that like men to have hair or might have inherit chest or hairy legs, but they all agree that women with Harris grows and there was no, no one like it was like all psyched up about girls being Harry,

Speaker 3:          02:21:37       something like that Shit. Hairy feet, fiery legs and shit. Really? Supposedly hippy dudes. Really? You think so? Fuck yeah man. Wow.

Speaker 4:          02:21:45       Well, okay. Maybe, but you. Almost universally. I mean there's gotta be a few exceptions, but almost universally we've accepted the fact that girls hair is not sexy, right?

Speaker 3:          02:21:53       I don't think so. Fucking hair. It's disgusting. Especially when they have it like on their back and just that amazing though, but

Speaker 4:          02:21:58       it's amazing that we make girls take stuff off their body that grows naturally to perpetrate some new, some new sleeker model that's coming in the future. That's less monkey. You know? That's clearly what we're trying to do when you're in a shave pussies and shaved legs and even when dudes shave themselves down and get all oiled up and try to look all sexy, what you're trying to do is you're trying to get as far away from the monkey as possible. You're becoming some sleek, you know, almost like silver surfer looking thing. You know where you're, you're, you're evolving. You know you're a form, you know your round and smooth and you're not Harry and fucking primitive and ape like, you know, like whatever. We're trying to do weird. Like that's like about evolution. We're trying to get rid of as much money as possible before we fuck you.

Speaker 4:          02:22:45       We don't want no crazy bitches. Gonna go nutty and ate the babies. We're try. We're going to want this bitch to get rid of all the hair. Get rid of everything. What's this shit with bleach that he believes that? No, this is wax, that shit. Wax It, watch it. But if I'm going to keep boxing, I just want to shave it. We're gonna. Get rid of it. We're going to give you hormones. Can't remember that you got to get rid of all this. Why is this down here? Why you have you right there? Can you ask that? Can you ask that we. Whatever we want to do, we want to make you as less monkey as possible. That's weird man. You know, I mean when you see like a big hairy dude. Do you remember George the Animal Steele from wrestling? George the animal steele was fucking bad ass pro wrestler and one of the things about him was he was so hairy.

Speaker 4:          02:23:20       I mean it was incredible. He was like an animal. He really was like a monkey. I mean he was just this thick fucking bald dude who had just hair everywhere. His back, his arm. He had been in a bunch of movies too because he's such a character. Such a unique look and God. But man, if there's anybody that ever looked more like an ape, me. So Harry, like that's why his nickname work. I mean if it was the same guy, but you shaved all that hair off, you couldn't call him George the animal steele. That wouldn't be nearly as good. The part was cool. It was that he's a fucking gorilla man. It was crazy to see three girls and a cup made you gang. This is one of those guys with fucks up everything. Yeah. No, you know, those guys will tell you a story. He said, fucking guy, three coats, Tracy Morgan guy. You know there was three girls. One Cup. I don't need to see that. I saw two girls. One Cup. That was bad enough. My. I'm surprisingly soft when it comes to shock [inaudible] stuff. How dare you, Eddie, strike. How dare you question my manhood. Yeah, no, you're right. I, you know what I think too much. So when I see something really fucked up, I don't just go, ah, faggots dead. I think of all the different shit that led up to it and how it happened and who did it and what the fuck is going on. Hook Dane Cook is having us alive. Exclusive comedy show or order. You have to pay for it.

Speaker 4:          02:24:47       Wow. That's what they're doing now. People are doing live shows and you pay for some people when you know when you're selling out selling out theaters, there's a reason he's not selling out theaters. She's telling out arena arena and there's a reason for that. You got a different beast. You got people that are just 14 and ready to go. Maybe it's the ejaculation at the end. No one wants to get hit. I don't know. I was talking about like that was too long ago. Sometimes people post something about what we were talking about five minutes ago. We don't remember what the fuck we were talking about five minutes ago. Mr Hans is horrific. Yes, it is horrific. If you haven't seen it, you must watch it. What are my thoughts on breast implants? Is it a ridiculous concept, vic? Norcal? Yeah, it is right. Breast, breast implants.

Speaker 4:          02:25:32       One of the weirdest things about human beings that it makes a girl more attractive. Maybe stick some things under her chest and parts of her body and pressed forward in our larger finger nipples. Anything like that. I love it. Who Do like like, um, silver dollar ones are big point. You want big silver dollar area, those are great, but like big tits, big tits. You know what's strange is how many people are getting jobs these days apparently took a real issue by job, by job or anything that's real. No, it's real apparently. That's awesome. She's always had that. It's not like there's any pictures of her back in the day, you know, she's just got those freak genetics. But there was um, um, a buddy of mine and he was joking around with this. He's been dating this girl for like four months. He's joking around. What'd you get?

Speaker 4:          02:26:18       A job like joking around about her ass being nice. And she goes, actually I did. And he's like, what? And it turns on like girls are getting them left and right to getting butt implants to make their butt stick out more. How about you just go to the gym? You fucking lazy bitches. Okay. You crazy lazy bitches. Put some weights on your back and do some fucking squats. Okay? What is your whole 24 hour day failed? You can't do some of this. Yes you can. You Lazy Bitch. Don't go to a fucking doctor's office having to cut a hole in your snatch and stuff. Some fucking airbags up there. That's ridiculous. Okay. You need to go to the fucking gym. If you want to grow an ass, go to the fucking gym. Jesus, right? Am I right? Brian? Now know you like fake, but I think there's nothing wrong with the difference between fake boobs and fake, but I think you're crazy.

Speaker 4:          02:27:09       You're not getting the real genetics. Let me tell you something. It's like fake steak. Okay? Girls who have like a real juicy ass or that real. The real wide hips, small waist, those girls are freaks. Okay? That's what. That's why guys are attracted to them. They have so much hormones in their body. They have so much going on. Those girls are horny as fuck. It's nature. Little wings, big ass. That's why you're attracted to them because they're the most capable of giving birth. They have birthing hips and we find those attractive and they have enough fat on the ass to ensure that they're going to survive during the pregnancy. We liked that with like a little plumpness. It's attractive to us and those that feels better. Trust me, those girls are freaks. Butter. But yeah, that's a real ass though. That's her real ass. It is, dude. It's a real ass. It's been confirmed scientists and uh, the fucking mythbusters got involved. They know it's a real ass fake tits. Look ridiculous. He's like, Yo will not go tell anybody. It's fake. Tits do ridiculous. But they still do look good sometimes too, man. You know, I'm not gonna lie. I know as a human being, I know it's completely ludicrous that I find a girl more attractive because she's got these bags and her skin and make her tits

Speaker 4:          02:28:22       hanging out more. But it's still, you do, you're more attracted to the frame. It's like there's something going on in our bodies. There's, there's a frequency that we try to hit physically that men try to hit and women try to hit to make themselves attractive to the opposite sex and whatever. Whatever the fuck it is. We, we, we try to, we try to be in and we try to nail it. It's being a certain weight and being healthy and smelling good and it's also being a certain shape. There's like women want a certain shape to men as guys who get like peck implants because they can't grow, they don't grow muscle very well I guess, and they try to do a lot of bench precedent. They get lazy and so they just stick these plastic things in their chest and make their, their, their own boobs grow out and they have things for their arms to and for the calves to make their bodies look bigger. I mean, it's all craziness. It's all, but it's all desire to be loved, you know? It all comes from some weird thing we want to be. We want to be the desirable shape that everybody's looking for. Very strange, you know?

Speaker 2:          02:29:19       Alright, what else we got here?

Speaker 4:          02:29:25       The painting behind me. What is it? It's not a painting. It's a photograph. It says an American girl in Italy in 1951, and it's by this lady Ruth Orkin, and she took a picture of this poor girl walking down the street and American girl and she's in Italy where my ancestors are from all fucking savages and they're all grabbing their dicks. Look at this, this picture, mad magazine. This guy's grabbing his dick is and he's making them that face and these guys are all laughing. There's an old guy and he's going to fucking cigarette out here like this and this guy's got his pants up through his rib cage and they're all staring mercilessly at this one chick. And she walks through this fucking snake pit of men. This gauntlet of Shitty dudes just hanging out in the street looking for trouble, looking at stick the Dick and somebody there.

Speaker 4:          02:30:12       Those people are savages. Living Room. They got loafers with no socks. Nineteen 51. And you know when people talk to you about the good old days and you know, you watch TV and see father knows best and you think that's what people really liked. Now that's what the people on tv, we really like. This shit was still going on. Human beings don't get, don't get tricked. We're not crazy. We've always been crazy. It's not like this generation's fucked up. Every generation's fucked up. So that's why I liked that picture. And on that note, ladies and gentlemen, I think that should be it. Right. Anything else? What about stick? Cam was a no go. What do you stick? Cam Junkie fellow. Was that your favorite site? I don't know if I'm, I don't know. Stiff Cam will be better, but ustream shoots you pretty good except right now it's frozen now. I just paused it. Oh, okay. Our upload is not as good as our downstream. That's way more sinister than I expected. What is sinister?

Speaker 2:          02:31:12       Alright. Um,

Speaker 4:          02:31:15       the Taliban is putting explosives and women's suicide bombers. This guy just said. Yeah, I did hear about that. That's pretty nutty. Yeah. Um, I don't know how they, I don't know how they talk those chicks into what I heard. What they're doing is they're raping women and they're getting these women and humiliating them and getting them to the point where they, uh, Coco's butt implants. Oh my goodness. This gentleman here just nailed it. And we're going to find out if you're correct, sir. If this guy's right, we've got a fucking scandal in our hands and this will be another case by the way, if it is right, a brian being able to spot the phony. Brian is awesome at spot in the phony. Brian spots more fake shit on the Internet than anybody I've ever met in my life. I think that's true. I think you deserve that designation. We get that dirty bitch. Oh, that's her. Oh my God. It's a fake ass. Fuck you. Oh my God. It makes you think that was real way to measure what makes you think that's real. Really. Oh my God. Oh my God. It's so real. Oh Jesus.

Speaker 4:          02:32:23       Coco before. But implants. God, she ruined a perfect. Asked to look at her ass and it looks pretty fucking high now. Hell yeah. It's cartoon asked. It's like Pamela Anderson back in the day. Now that I find out there's some bags of shit in there. No, I'm not into it. I liked the old hotel. It was a beautiful ass. Did you put it online? Did you retweet that? The gentleman. Did you tweet that to me, buddy? I'll retweet that shit.

Speaker 2:          02:32:54       That's pretty,

Speaker 4:          02:32:56       pretty powerful. So it looks like Coco has a God damn button implant plant. Ladies and gentlemen, what the fuck man? What the fuck is there anything sacred in this world anymore? So do twitter that to me man. My friend told her that to Joe Rogan. Got Net and I'll retweet it at Coco's butt implants then otherwise if you could post it,

Speaker 2:          02:33:17       post that link post that way.

Speaker 4:          02:33:21       Okay. What is it? I'll get it. I'll do it right now.

Speaker 2:          02:33:30       Um,

Speaker 4:          02:33:31       so that's really what's important. Moral Ladies and gentlemen, we went from space to Coco's button plants. That's how we roll here. And the Joe Rogan podcast. Uh, I think that was the end. Ladies and gentlemen, Brian and I are going to go get something to eat. I'm hungry actually. Now I'm going to try to beat the traffic. The traffic. All right, Patricia, to Jill Scott, you can't leave me. I don't know who that is. I'm happy to. Happy. I don't know to ask. These gentlemen have been inundated by human beings and information. I wish you well in your battle to try to figure out what the fuck this is all about. Until then, see you next week.
