Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Hey Dude.

Speaker 2:          00:00:06       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:00:06       The Joe Rogan experience.

Speaker 2:          00:00:08       Try my day. Joe Rogan podcast by night all day.

Speaker 3:          00:00:16       Once upon a time we were in Phoenix, Arizona. And uh, there was like an open mic competition. Was that what it was?

Speaker 1:          00:00:23       No, I think it was um, a contest for the Las Vegas comedy. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:00:27       Festival. Ah, it was a Los Vegas comedy festival contest and the one young man stood out and a wound up working with us that weekend and it's this Guy Josh McDermitt who was on the fucking walking dead now.

Speaker 1:          00:00:39       Yeah, man. How's that happen? I don't know man. I was just talking to Brian about it. Like I'm, I've hit the jackpot

Speaker 3:          00:00:46       dude. You got a lottery ticket. You get the Willy Wonka golden ticket. You're on like one of the greatest shows ever.

Speaker 1:          00:00:51       It was my favorite show before I came in. So literally like I hit the fan lottery and I'm just like, I don't know man. It's weird. It's really surreal to think about like cause that show, I don't know man w that show in Phoenix that we did like you were doing a weekend there and then, then they asked the audience after your show to stick around so that they could do this little, it was like a contest or some sort of showcase to select someone to go to this festival and they put me last and the first comment goes up and half of your crowd, like most of your crowds stuck around. Half the crowd walks after the first comic and I was like, ah shit man. And I'm sitting in the back next to you and I hadn't met you. I mean I met you like as I worked at that radio station, but like you know, we didn't know each other.

Speaker 1:          00:01:35       You're just eating your meal and you're watching this and I'm looking at you and you're not laughing at anybody because it wasn't funny. And I was like, oh this sucks man. Like Rogan's just going to be like, man, these guys fucking suck. Like he's going to talk trash about us or whatever. More and more people keep leaving too. As the show's going on to, to the point that's like a 500 seat theater and there's like 30 people left by the time I get up and I didn't give a shit at that point. And literally I heard you laughing the loudest in the back am I sat and I'm like, well that's a victory I guess. And then I got to go to the festival and that was fun and everything. But like you literally, you asked me, you're like, hey, you know you want to open for me the rest of the weekend. And that just kind of set me on this path to come to la and pursue acting and the continue to do standup and all that dude. Like I don't know how much you realize, like how important you've been to me, man. Seriously. That's ridiculous. I wouldn't be here. I literally wouldn't be here.

Speaker 3:          00:02:28       Wow. Well that's amazing because you're, you're fucking fantastic on that show, dude. So it was all meant to be one of those things. Yeah. I don't believe in fate, but if I did believe in fate, there's plenty of evidence. There's plenty of evidence. Yeah. And if there's a fucking bill Hicks, bio pic dude, you're playing,

Speaker 1:          00:02:45       you're not the first person to tell me this is Craig Russell Crowe's got like got the rights to some like bill story.

Speaker 3:          00:02:51       Yeah, well they'll probably ruin it. It's, it's probably not something you want to be involved with anyway. And it's like, it seems like every time they do a about a guy that it was a real person, they just butchered the reality and fuck with it.

Speaker 1:          00:03:07       What are they doing something with Kinison awhile ago supposedly. Yeah, I saw some trailer come out with some guy, I don't remember who he is. Like I recognize them from different movies but like he was on stage just being Sam and I was like, oh my God, this is amazing. But that was like five years ago and I hadn't heard anything about that. I haven't seen that. I never saw a train know who it was. It was in that movie. Take me home tonight with Topher grace. He played one of the guy, he like his friend in it, Dan, Josh Gad. It wasn't John. He was a Josh Gad type, says Josh Gad to play Queen. A place names dude that walked in and out because of projects. Probably been on the shelf for so long. They'll fuck it up because they're doing that prior movie too, aren't they

Speaker 3:          00:03:51       that up too? I think that already came out. Yeah, the prior moon. No, no. You're thinking of the Jimi Hendrix movie that came out and that was dog shit. They ruined them, man. I mean, you know, there's this guy, Mark Schultz and he was the Olympic wrestler that, uh, his brother Dave Schultz got killed by that guide. John Dupont, that crazy millionaire billionaire guy in Connecticut. They fucked that up, man. I went to see that movie and you know, he was, he, he's Mark Schultz made a bunch of tweets about it. About how pissed off he was. Yeah. About the, they fucked with his story. They fucked with his timeline. They fucked with how much success he actually had as a wrestler. Before he went to, he was already an Olympic gold medalist and a world champion. They made it out like it was struggling and sure, they added a bunch of weird gay shit. They, they, they, they changed the timeline of when he fought in the UFC and the UFC fought a white guy instead of a black guy. They changed the timeline of the UFC. He made the UFC in 1987 didn't even exist until 1993 like Hollywood is filled with assholes, just filled with assholes and think that they can alter reality. We talking about a real life story. A guy's real fucking story.

Speaker 1:          00:05:03       Yeah. It's, they do seem to screw it up a lot, but I don't really know. Is there anyone that they've done that? Has there been a movie that we kind of go, oh yeah, that's pretty great.

Speaker 3:          00:05:13       You never, Lenny, Dustin Hoffman Played Lenny Bruce and he fucking nailed it. Yeah, it was, and it was a really good movie. Like, if you watch that movie, Lenny, you really feel like, you kind of understand what Lenny Bruce was going through. This is back when he was being tried for censorship. He would, he would, he would go in front of these courts and they would make, they would do his act. They would read his act out loud, like the words that he said, convict him for these, uh, these profanity charges. I mean, that guy really fucking paved the path. If it wasn't for him, you and I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for the guys that like him and George Carlin, the guys that actually went to jail for saying words that we say on a regular basis. Right. If there's a 50

Speaker 4:          00:05:58       fucking years ago, it wasn't that long ago. I know. It's crazy. If you really stop and think it's insanity, man. Did you see that preview for the New Light Nwa movie? That looks pretty legit. I mean, it's a great trailer documentary, isn't it? No, no, no. It's uh, actually, uh, it's just about them growing up. It was a neat, yeah, it's kind of like, and they have a guy that looks kind of like ice cube and it, I mean he sounds just like ice cube. It's really neat. Who's in it? A bunch of no names mostly. But uh, I guess that's why the whole thing happened with the big guy. TMZ, Josh McDermitt tweeting. Wally's on a fucking podcast. Can't do it. Put it down. I'm trying, I'm trying to find that guy. Which guy here? Sam Kennison guy here. He found it. You put the picture up on the edge. Yeah. So isn't it?

Speaker 5:          00:06:46       Hold on.

Speaker 4:          00:06:47       How dare you,

Speaker 1:          00:06:50       you were making such a big deal over there. There. Yeah. This,

Speaker 4:          00:06:54       what does the screen test? Dan Fogler screen test. Tony winner. Is that who the guy is? Well that's a screen test. Hold on. Stop. That's a screen test. That's not a trailer. Yeah, I didn't,

Speaker 1:          00:07:04       I didn't know it was a screen test when I watched it. It did. I mean I would have known if it said screen test, but wherever, uh,

Speaker 4:          00:07:12       yeah, I mean, yeah, I saw it. That might not be him. I mean, either way they'll ruin it probably, but if they do a bill Hicks one and they're going to ruin it and give you a lot of money, I say fine. I'd rather, if we're going to ruin it, it, I'd rather it be me ruining it. Then someone else, you know, let's, let's have some respect for the guy. Do that character you play on the walking dead. It's very unusual. That's a weird character. Like a strange sort of pseudo autistic, really intelligent but fucked up dude involved in like one of the, like the shows not even about the monsters anymore. No,

Speaker 1:          00:07:44       it's about the humans and their interactions with each other and just them surviving, you know, the, um, the apocalypse. I mean, the biggest threat isn't, yeah, isn't the zombies, it's, you know, the guy with the eye patch the governor or it's like someone else going like, yeah, you got food and water. I want that. Yeah. That's what's really scary. But this character, you know, it's kind of funny when I hear people like really simplify him and go, he's just weird. And I'm like, okay, it's a lot more than that. There's a lot more to him. He's very complex and, um, you know, it's fun to play a different character on in this world where like, you know, obviously you got guys like, you know, Daryl or Michaun who were just like epic bad asses and obviously those people are probably going to rise to the top in this world, you know, just people who are physically fit and can just, you know, do whatever they have to do to survive. This guy is like completely opposite. And that's what becomes fun about playing him is that, you know, you just wouldn't expect that. I think I have a theory that if most be, if the apocalypse happened, most people would be more like Eugene. They would like Daryl.

Speaker 4:          00:08:46       Yeah, most likely. Did you know the, the whole character arc, like what was going to happen to him? Like, I mean, I don't want to give away too much if you're one of those that binge watches

Speaker 3:          00:08:56       stop now cause we're probably going to talk too much about the show. We'll fuck it up for you. Spoiler alert.

Speaker 1:          00:09:02       I, um, well obviously the show is based on a comic. So you know, the information is out there from there. But on the show they like to do it. They'd like to deviate from the story lines on the comics. And how much did they deviate? I mean they'll just create brand new storylines for people. Um, again, if you haven't watched this last weekend's episode, there was a major character death, but his death, you know, he dies in the comics, but the death and on the show was not how they did it in the comics. There was another character that, that guy's death was this guy from last weekend's death in the comics. And it's show, it just gets mixed around. Um, but with, uh, so I knew that, you know, when I took the job, I knew that the big reveals that my character would have, and this is weird to be talking about it in vague terms. I feel like if you haven't seen it by now, yeah, fuck you. If you haven't seen it. It was, so we find out Eugene was lying about knowing the cure. But the moment, cause I came on in season four, I knew that, um, he was lying the whole time. Oh, okay. Um, but you know, I don't think some of the other actors knew, you know, because they don't read the comics. They don't really tell us what's going on with other people's storylines.

Speaker 3:          00:10:12       Right. And you don't know necessarily whether they're going to stick with that storyline that's in the comic or whether they're going to deviate.

Speaker 1:          00:10:18       Right. And so that's where like, you know, I knew that I was lying and that, uh, once I, once that was revealed, like all bets are off. Like I don't know how much longer I have, you know, how much longer be I'll be on the show because they like to kill off their main characters. So I'm just like, Oh shit.

Speaker 3:          00:10:34       All right. Hey man, this is going to launch you, dude. I mean, you're, you're on one of the best shows ever. Dude is insane. It's epic. It's so good. I watched last night and I was squeezing my wife's hand while the show. I've watched it. They didn't, you know, this week's episode, I didn't watch it until last night. I'm just, cause she's like, Oh man, like on my hand handling you get fucking crazy. It's such a good show. And it wasn't for a while. It was really good in the beginning. And then it was like a little dip where I was like, oh, don't go Dexter on me. You fucks. Don't, don't fail. But then it pulled out like a Phoenix rose from the ashes. Even greater than before.

Speaker 1:          00:11:11       I know, man. It's, it's insanity cause like, so the guy who runs our show now, Scott Gimble, he and I don't really pay attention to who writes episodes. Like I just, I'm just like, oh, that's my favorite episode, but I'm not like looking up who wrote it. So I started going back and looking at my favorite episodes and I found out who wrote it and it was Scott Gimple's. So my favorite episodes from season three was that episode clear where they're in that dude's apartment and he's got all the writing on the wall and like he's gone absolutely crazy. Do you remember this guy, Scott Campbell wrote that episode? I was like, oh this is awesome. It's one of my favorite episodes. And then the other favorite episode of mine was, um, when Sophia, the little girl came out of the barn and she was a Zombie and they had to kill her and it's like

Speaker 4:          00:11:54       he wrote that episode and I'm like, okay. So this guy running the show now has written my favorite episodes all along and it's like he's like the best guy to be running the show because you're right. I think, you know, it did kind of take it down. It was still a good show, but it's just like, it just kind of like plateaued for a moment. This is just me observing as a fan. You know what it felt like. It felt like a regular show. It's like, it was so extraordinary in the beginning, like the character arc between Rick and his buddy who was banging his wife cause they thought Rick was dead. Like all that crazy shit. It was so much nutty tension. It's just like, it left you in this weird space while you're watching now where you didn't know what to expect. And then the zombies were new at that point.

Speaker 4:          00:12:34       And it was, it was, it was so much going on. It was like, whoa. Every time the, the, you know, it would fade the black at the end of the episode, you'd be like, fuck, you know, you just have to catch your breath. And then it got to be like a lazy Hollywood show. And I was like, what happened? Did some fuck head producer weasel his way into a position of power and start manipulating and shit and trying to turn it into a number of the episode of coach or something like that. Yeah. Just, you know, administering Nelson shows up. Like something happened like that. Like it just became like a regular show. I don't know the specifics, but um, frank Darabont, you know, Shawshank redemption is great. Hollywood screen writer and director develop the show from the comics and then he, he was in charge of it the first two seasons, but then he left after the second season.

Speaker 4:          00:13:20       And so it's about the third season that they kind of dip went over some rocky terrain. Like, you know, they did it. There was some great episodes. It might be my favorite episode is in season three, but there they just didn't really hit. It was very inconsistent. And so then when Scott Gamble took overseas and for it, just took them right off right off. It's amazing now. God Damn, it's a good show. He's, you know, cause I think just watching it as a fan, I would, it would kind of get boring at times where I'd be like, okay, like they run out of supplies and they're going to go on a run and oh, it's not me. Pops out, kill it, and then rinse, repeat, whatever. So, but now they're like really developing the characters and like bringing them, you know, we're learning so much more about them.

Speaker 4:          00:14:01       It's like fricking great. Well, it's made, it makes me nervous. Every time there's a new scene, it's like, it's, it's so good right now. Every time there's a new scene, like literally entered into that community where, uh, the, the, the kid who played kick Chris rock grew up in and as soon as you entered the community, I'm like, Oh fuck yeah. You know, like what's happening here? Like you're fucking, Paul starts racing, you start getting sweaty hands. She like a little nonchalant about it. Like they're just coming in, just maybe checking around and you're like, oh no, you've gotta be looking everywhere at this point. It's so good man. And when he got bit like you see just a shadow behind him, just a brief shadow before it comes out. It's like, it's not enough that you, you know, you see it clearly coming. It's like, oh fuck. What does that, what does that, is that, is that the kid that he's with or is that someone else? Who's The fucking shadow man? Who's The fucking Chad?

Speaker 1:          00:14:52       The great thing about that bite was that it happened like 20 minutes into the episode as opposed to like, sometimes they'll wait until the very end. It's like, oh no. And then they just, and then the episode ends like he get bit, he gets bit and then he has his, you know, hallucinogenic dreams and all this about these, you know, pass characters are coming back and all this. I mean it was like a very, Robert Kirkman, the guy who created the comics was saying like, it's going to be a fan favorite episode is going to be a fan hated episode because it's like, it's a very poetic type of episode that they wrote. I really loved that dude too. I'm going to miss him. He's nuts. He's so funny, man. Is He, you got to get a lot of here. He's like, the funniest guy is very subtle and then you just get them on a roll and he's just like large and gregarious.

Speaker 1:          00:15:37       Like he mispronounces everything and I don't know if he's doing it as a bit like he goes, there was some, I guess he went to like University of Virginia or something and there are some, some school in Virginia in and they're like doing away with sat scores are only gonna focus on the GPA now. And then he retweets it and puts it the front. Oh hell yeah. My Alma Marta, Marta, and may our DA. You don't know if he's like kidding or not, but like we were over at the table where they keep all the food one day when we were filming and he's just going to get, yeah, go, oh, you see something you like? He's like, yeah, I'm going to eat me some beef jersey.

Speaker 1:          00:16:21       And I like, I just look at it. I don't know. I don't laugh. I'm like, is he just like dumb or is he doing this on purpose? Like he's the funniest guy. He's so funny. I'll hook it up, I'll, I'll get, I'll get him in here. He's great because he's off doing another show now, I guess. Yeah, it's, I mean, it's gotta be weird when you're on like an amazing show and then all of a sudden your debt, it ends, it ends for you. And you sit back and you're watching it as it's still on television. You watched on the guys who worked with, you know, and occasionally they bring you back for some dream sequence and you're, and you're thinking, you know, it's very cliche to say, but it's so real. Like we're like, we're just a major, like a big family there, you know, cause we're in the woods in Georgia, it's the worst time of year to be there.

Speaker 1:          00:17:05       It's hot and humid fighting off ticks and bugs and use things called chiggers that like burrow into your skin and everything and then you're just out there like with your friends and family and it's great. And all of a sudden now you die and you can't come to work anymore. He can't come to this horrible environment anymore and you just want it so bad. But um, you know, we'd go around and we do all these like comic con conventions and stuff, which is like, dad is trippy, but like we get to hang out then and everything. So you never really fully, you know, disappear. That dude who was, um, Rick's buddy, what was his name? Shane. Shane, yeah. That guy is in a lot of shit. Like, he's in a lot of movies. He's really good loan up. He's really, do you see fury? No. Fury was great. Um, I don't know if it was based on a true story. You're not the Brad Pitt tank movie, but Jon Bernthal, that's the character, the, the actor's name. Phenomenal. Like I was surprised he didn't get nominated for an Oscar.

Speaker 3:          00:18:01       He was great in the wolf of Wall Street too. Oh yeah. Yeah, he's really good. He's,

Speaker 1:          00:18:06       he's like an ex boxer or something. So like everything he ever does is very physical. All this rolls, he wants to just be, I mean he treats it like he's in the boxing ring.

Speaker 3:          00:18:14       Didn't he get in trouble for beating somebody up? Something happened.

Speaker 1:          00:18:18       Yeah, I think I'm lazy. He Lo, he has pitbulls I think he rescues pit bulls and then, you know, lives in La and some douche bag was complaining about his pit bulls or whatever. And then his pit bull started getting a little feisty and angry. And then I think, I think he just popped him in the face. Oh, I rude. Like a gentleman. I don't know. There's probably stories about it online, but I think the guy was just like, oh, bit balls, whatever the fuck you, boom. Wow. Like one of those things. But he's a great guy. He's really cool.

Speaker 3:          00:18:48       Yeah. He's a really good actor too. That the whole arc, that story arc between him and Rick was just suck. Oh Well Huh.

Speaker 1:          00:18:55       I've done just as many episodes as him now granted like he was at the forefront with like, you know, all his, uh, with, with the storylines and stuff that I've done just as many episodes, but like he is just like at this other level I can't ever compare with, you know, what do you mean? Well, he, I mean he's just like, it was such an iconic character in this huge storyline within that show. So the first season was only six episodes and then I did four episodes my first season, so like, and then he dies to the next season and I did just as many episodes as him. Does that make sense? Like sort of together. We've done the same amount of episodes, but he's just like at this other level in terms of like how people remember him and like the character and all that

Speaker 3:          00:19:36       classic scenario too, like coveting thy neighbors wife, you know, that's like, that's the big thing with, with men. Like the, one of the men's biggest fear is that their best friend winds up fucking their girlfriend. Yeah. I mean, I mean that is a big, or their wife or the mother of their children, you know, and becomes a father to their son. You know? I mean there's, that's like, and he wanted to take over and he tried to kill him. I mean, that whole, that whole thing was like so intense. It's such a crazy dynamic in the kid. The kid's amazing kids going to to Shane for advice. Like Rick's getting pissed and I mean, it was awesome. It was, it was intense. It was intense. And it brought you in to this, this changing dynamic of the zombies not being the problem, the people being the problem and how the people react when they have to formulate their own rules.

Speaker 3:          00:20:25       You know, I mean everybody that says like, uh, like preppers, everybody says I'm ready. You know, I got my fucking cans. Like you ain't ready for Shit Dude. Cause it ain't about that. It's, it's, it's about how you react to all these thinking animals that are trying to get what you have now because they're starving to death. Right. Cause that's what the fuck happens when the, if the apocalypse happened, it's like if the big one hits, you want to be right where it, you want the earth to open up, suck you in and close shut, don't die of starvation. Don't die because people are eating you. Like in terminus you, you want to, you know, you don't want to be the guy who gets baseball bat and then gets your fucking throat cut into that. The trough, you know, you want to be the guy who the meteor hits right on your face.

Speaker 3:          00:21:07       Yeah. The vein here, that wipes out the power grid, you want it to land right in your head space. You know what I mean? Really if you're going to go fuck, fuck, going a year later or 10 years later. Well, I mean, if you think about it, I mean obviously my character was saying that he had a cure and everything, there's probably going to be no cure if everything starts getting over run at that point, they're not going to figure out how to reverse it or how to fix it. So yeah, you want to go first? Well, not only that, not only is there no cure, but everyone's infected. Yeah. That's what's the most fucked up thing when you find out that everyone who dies becomes a Zombie. Like when chain died and they became a Zombie and you know, like, okay, this is nuts.

Speaker 3:          00:21:47       Like there's no way out. Right? Like you're your way out is gone, right? Because everyone's a fucking Zombie. So if you make a kid and the kid is just born into your family and no one that kid dies, it's a fucking Zombie. Right? Everyone's a Zombie somehow. Somehow has that. Does that ever get explained? Don't tell me. Um, no, I don't think there's, I don't think they're just going to, they don't have time to sit around and figure that out. I think it was like, we got to find a can of beans, man. I gotta find some fish. Wait, now guys, hold on. We need to talk about this. Yeah, it's a w it's a weird fucking weird scenario. The idea of being the last remaining survivors and like, did you see the road, uh, who was, uh, that was that very bleak post apocalyptic movie with, uh, the fuckers.

Speaker 3:          00:22:36       That dude's name Veit door. Morgenson what's his name? Vigo. Vigo. Morgenson like I did, I watched it for five minutes until he was teaching his son how to shoot himself in the mouth. This is what you do, if you know, if it's all over, you stick through. Oh, it cut. We're good. I don't need to see this shit. I just don't, I just don't need to see this. I mean, what am I going to get out of this? I'm going to get, feel depressed. There's not even any monsters. At least the walking dead gives me monsters. Yeah, right. Well, the thing, the cool thing about the walking dead too is they're always trying to maintain some sort of humanity, some sort of like, you know, civility. Yeah, some rules and everything and they're constantly, like, even this last week's episode, they're just like, yeah, I've given up, screw it.

Speaker 3:          00:23:18       Like I wanted to kill that person, not because of what they did, but just fuck them, you know? And you're like, oh Geez, like it's all falling away. And uh, that's kind of where the season's going. It's just going to get crazier. I wasn't a big fan of that hospital. The CIC wearing makeup and all that. I'm like, come on, get the fuck out of here with all this. That was, I thought that was a little ridiculous. Like she's way too groomed. She's on her fucking bicycle every day working out. Everyone's scared of her like that. I didn't buy that at all. I felt like that shit would've lasted about an hour. We're somebody punched her in the face, took a gun and shot her in the head, fucked her dead body, threw her off the top of the roof. She's evil. Get out of here. You fucking crazy.

Speaker 3:          00:23:56       Lipstick weren't [inaudible]. There's a few guys that didn't. The guy with the eye patch get the fuck out of here. That guy's a dead. He's dead. He's not going to live. You can't even see shit that's coming from the right side, dude. You're not going to survive. That is not, you're not running anything. Okay. I don't buy it always extra evil. He doesn't even have superpowers. Like how's that guy is going to run? Shit. He's manipulative. How? He's not even a manipulative. He's not even demonstrably believe manipulative. You know? It's like, what is he doing? Just fucking, it's weak. It's weak. Weak game. It's got a week. Colt game. Dammit. Stand on my left. I can't see you. God Man. Yeah. There was like, you know, there was a few bad guys in a few moments that I just thought were ridiculous, but it's the overall quality of the show that just, it keeps a, keeps surprising you and he keeps drawing you in and it just keeps making you think like, what would you do if you were stuck in that kind of a scenario? Would you would just climb to the highest building and just close your eyes and fucking jump off? Like what would you do? Yeah, I don't know. I would, I would try and survive and I would probably be one of the first to go is what I would do personally. I would try, I'd be like, okay, I got it,

Speaker 6:          00:25:07       this and then I'd get bit like, what about you exactly what I would do. You don't even watch the show. And I didn't sleep. No. I started watching it, but I got to the season three and then I stopped and I just haven't gone back. But I've read the comics a lot, most of them. Oh Wow. Uh, which, uh, I enjoy in and looking at the comics, there should be like, what, 11 or 12 seasons up to already written. They got so many storylines. It's not even,

Speaker 3:          00:25:36       it's a money machine. What? I mean, it's, it makes so much money. It's so good. One of the things is I watch it on the, um, uh, on Apple TV, which is the only way to watch it. Watching it on AMC. It's like you just want to fucking drive to wherever the people are. Who who put the commercials in and go, Hey, fucking stop. Fucking stop. Come on man. This is not cool. You got to Hardee's commercial or a fucking, you know Carl's Jr jammed in the middle of murder and mayhem. All of a sudden people are driving the newest Toyota truck. We're having a party. It's fucking so distracting and so uncomfortable when you realize that they're shoving in 18 minutes of fucking commercials in a one hour show. That's obscene. Yeah, it's rough. It's obscene. It really is obscene, but when you watch it on Itunes, it's fucking awesome because you get the whole show, no interruptions. Watch it. I tried watching it one time and we paused and we just left the room. We go. It was just fucking come back in an hour and fast forward through this bullshit. Like we tried to just watch the commercials for a while and you realize like what an, that shit is on your attention span. I just, it's an assault on your, your, your reality. Like you, why do you want me to dip in and out of this world like that? Yeah. It fucks up the whole viewing aspect of the show.

Speaker 1:          00:26:55       Well I, I mean I want to validate your opinion there, but he's got to get paid [inaudible] killed off next season. I love the commercials. Commercials are amazing. I wish it was half an hour of the show. Would you rather prefer like, like, like commercials bill into the show? Like they're driving a Toyota car instead of having a Toyota commercial or

Speaker 3:          00:27:19       it would have to, the only way it would have to be non intrusive and there's no way that it would work if it was not in. She was like, you know, if you see some people that are fucking starving to death and they find a can of coke and they drink it in a Sharon it back and forth, it's not going to make you want to go out and buy a coke. You know, you know that coke is fucking warm. It's Georgia finding it in someone's garage covered in fucking bodies. Three years expired. Yeah. I mean it's just, it wouldn't work. And then when they do do that, they do it like this.

Speaker 1:          00:27:50       Hey Man, do you think we're going to get outta here? They're holding it. I don't know what this fucking good coke, you know? I mean there's no way that they had to do it. Did y'all ever see like the honest trailers, the youtube channel where they do honest trailers of movies and TV shows and they did one for the walking dead where they're just like, pick it apart. It's hilarious. But one of the things they were talking about was like they were driving around like a Hyundai Tucson for a while and it was always like, this is the apocalypse or everything's filthy. There's like a gross film on things. And, but the Hyundai Tucson was like immaculate. Like they're just cruising through the woods and this thing and it, like I, me personally, I never thought about it. I was never like, oh, I should go buy a Tucson or something. But not until I saw that trailer. I was like, oh, I guess I was product placement. You know,

Speaker 3:          00:28:37       it had to be, if they're making it clean. There was one episode, I remember where we were talking about it. We're like, why? Why are these cars clean? I mean even when it rains, it doesn't really clean your car. That could, you know, I mean they have to fucking have a torrential downpour to do a half ass job of cleaning your car. Cause bird shit dirt. It just kinda gets like moved around on it. Right. You know?

Speaker 1:          00:29:00       Well people still have to find their place in the apocalypse and maybe some people are like, hey man, I'm just here to wash cars.

Speaker 3:          00:29:07       We're alive. We got cars. Let's Polish him up. Let me wash them. Yeah. I don't think that there's going to be a ever a show like that that has product placement as opposed to advertising. But I think it's probably likely and other shows and like, I mean, then you know, they do that. And like when you watch iron man, you see him driving an Audi, Audi paid to get that fucking car in the movie. I mean it's, it's appropriate for him. It doesn't stick out like a sore throat. I'm, he's driving this cool car. He's a rich dude. It all makes sense. But,

Speaker 1:          00:29:37       well you look at something like madman too, which is like centered on the world of, but I think the catch 22 with that is like, like they can't really do any current, you know, advertising. They're doing all like old, like lucky strike cigarettes and this and that. Then it's like, well I don't think those are around anymore. Are they, you know, are they around? But it's just, you know, everything they do is like from the 60s and whatnot. So unless it's like General Electric, which is so vague, you know, it's still like, people are like, yeah, that's right. General Electric. I should go buy a stove. I've never watched that show. Is that a good show? Madman? It's good, but it's a, it's a little slow. It's, I think it's more geared towards women maybe. Uh, cause it's very drama kind of. It's not that guy ish. Like I just watched it because my girlfriend wanted to watch it and that's the only reason I watched it. And I kind of got addicted to it and kind of like an a Gilmore girls kind of way where you're like, oh, I know all of the characters. So it's still fun to watch Gilmore girls. I had to watch, I've watched all the Gilmore girls because of the girl I was dating and I got into it. It was a great show. The girl from the Gilmore girls years old man,

Speaker 4:          00:30:44       Lauren from the Gilmore girls. She was on a season of a news radio. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I worked with it. She's very cool. She's fun chick

Speaker 1:          00:30:52       mad men was a good show. I guess it's coming back for their final season. I did a couple episodes of that and like it was kind of neat to like be in that world and everything. But um, it was one of those shows where like you, you kind of hated a bunch of the characters at first and then, and you'd like some others. And then like by season three, that reverse the people you liked and you're now hated. And the people that liked and they kind of went through these crazy evolutions. You know, I think kind of like any show, I mean, it has its moments where you're like, okay, maybe I'll skip this episode is kind of boring me or whatever. But um, you know, for the most part it was pretty interesting. The, um, the

Speaker 4:          00:31:27       girl, the very voluptuous, redheaded girl that's like the big deal and that show, oh, Christina Hendricks, see her all who has body fat, you know, but it's still sexy. She's a slut in the show too. How dare she? Is She, uh, yeah, I think she's a little, a bit promiscuous a bit. It's not slut shame. And the 50s, Brian, she's awesome. She says she's,

Speaker 1:          00:31:49       she's a strong character though. She's a strong woman, you know, but she, I mean, they passed her around kind of. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:31:54       It's gotta be strong carrying around all that weight. Right? It's big burly. Yeah, that's what I'm saying. Those breasts to Kohl's. You gotta you gotta have some fucking backbone. You seen her naked photos? No, but I mean for, I think for women like to have breasts that are that large. It's probably really, I know it's, it's really difficult on your back. I did, a girl had a breast reduction because their boobs are so big. She was born, which is like with a really large breasts. Her back always hurt and then she got her breasts reduced and she was like, it's like the world took a weight off our shoulders. No. Think about it like that. But if you have like double e tits, I mean that's like, those are fucking probably like 20 pounds or something around a lot of God damn meat. That's a lot.

Speaker 4:          00:32:33       I saw her in person at a table reading to her boobs weren't as big as they appear to be on TV or in pictures and stuff. So I think she just kind of looked like a normal person, but they just made me push them up a bit. You know what I mean? Oh, well maybe they CGI or spread around, but I've seen her in like photos. She looks a very voluptuous but sexy. Like, she doesn't look very sad. She doesn't look like, listen bitch, you know, you gotta get off that fucking craft service table. Right. It doesn't look like that. She looked like a normal healthy curvy girl. Yeah. She just looks normal in real life. But you know about this tricks bodies could probably imagine if you're here, listen to this. I love how that, that she's like the number one Photoshop to girl on the Internet.

Speaker 4:          00:33:16       There's like thousands of photos. There's so many fans that are in love with her boobs. So they overdo it. Yeah, but you're showing a porn dummy. Huh? There's porn there. Oh yeah. But I mean, I'm talking about, don't know, I'm just showing it to you. Okay. Yeah. I'm just showing it to you. But she was, she was a part of the faculty or the f whatever it was called. Yeah. Were people uh, stole when they got the, the cloud photos people and their goddamn cloud phone. So she had a lot of naked ones. I think she had three, if I remember her. Yeah, let it shine. Girl. That shit. The those shows about alternative times are always odd to, you know, those shows that they're doing, like from the 1950s of the 1960s the period piece shows are always very strange. I think he got to have someone who's like autistic running that show, you know, someone who just like can consume all the knowledge from within that time, that era.

Speaker 4:          00:34:10       So they can just like, you know, do that cause for me, if I were like writing on a show that took place in the 60s I would be putting in and then he grabbed his iPhone. It like, I wouldn't be thinking, I'm like, Oh God, we're in the 60s if you just need like this, this super nerd who just knows everything about the 60s and that's it. Well that's what we were talking about. What that movie Fox catcher that they fuck with timelines. Like when you're doing something that's historical, it's very important that you stick to the timeline because otherwise, why are you even doing an historical movie? Right? Just did do a movie that's completely fictional, that's like influenced by or inspired by a true story. And you're trying to do an actual real story though. Yeah. That whole story was messed up though. I mean the, the, the true actual story of the Fox catcher thing.

Speaker 4:          00:34:52       I mean, beyond good grief. I, and Mark Rufallo was great and it hazing and then, um, and I, even Steve Carell, Steve Carell was awesome and it seemed like the same guy. No, not at all. And he played that, that role so perfect. The role of this eccentric, nutty, like really fucked up cokehead multimillionaire, billionaire or whatever it was that he played it so well. Like you really believe that he was this guy with no character that had been handed everything to him in his life and he just didn't understand. Yeah, that was a good movie. And Channing Tatum, I mean, I'm not like the biggest fan of because cause don't like him cause my wife likes it. Mensa, she thinks he's good looking and she wishes I had his body. But um,

Speaker 3:          00:35:37       no, he, you know, I don't know. I'm just not like Magic Mike. I just was like, it wasn't your favorite movie. No, but they were naked and dancing. I don't get it. I don't understand you. But he was great in Foxcatcher. He was really good. He was, he was just walking around. It looked like a giant ape. Yeah. He stuck his lower jaw because that's what like when you look at Mark Schultz in real life, he has this very prominent, you know, fucking ape like jaw. Oh Wow. Mark Schultz was a beast. Dude. He was really weird the way they did the movie because they could have easily had him fight the guy that he fought in the UFC in the movie. But instead they made up some guy made him fight a white guy. It was really weird. He fought, he fought Gary Goodrich. It happened in 1996.

Speaker 3:          00:36:24       It's a fucking historical fact, but in this stupid fucking movie, it was a different guy. And uh, the, the UFC took place, like when he was watching it on television was in like 87 or 88. Yeah. They fucked with everything in that movie. So they fucked with his accomplishments. Like when he went to it, the Foxcatcher farms or whatever the, the, the guy called it, he was already a world champion multiple times. He was one of the best wrestlers on earth and they made it look like he was living in his brother's shadow. Like she wasn't, you know, it's just not true. When they did that, just to add drama to the storyline, like this guy needed his brother there in order to rise to occasionally. He's the big dumb Ayp and his brother is really intelligent and a really good wrestler. I was brother was really good, but he was really good too.

Speaker 3:          00:37:08       You know, and then they just, they always do that. They'll do it with the Kennison movie. They'll do what the Hicks movie get. Trying to spin it a little bit to give, you know, for some dramatic effect or whatever. But you can't say that it's a true story at that point, but you don't have to spin it when the story is so fucking crazy. I mean, Steve Carell's character, that Guy John Dupont was in real life to the things he did were so fucked up and so crazy. Yeah. I mean, he really did shoot Mark Schultz, Mark Shields, brother Dave in front of his family. He fucking pulled out a gun and shot him in a cocaine psychosis. Yeah. And that was real. You know, so it's, you don't have to, you don't have to monkey with that man. Right. Weird enough. But maybe, I mean, I'm, I'm not like justifying it, but maybe when there's just millions and millions and millions of dollars on the line and will start overthinking it.

Speaker 3:          00:37:59       There's too many cooks in the kitchen and Nah, we gotta have him fight a white guy. We can't, you know. Yeah. They change it. True. That is true. That's not to say it's okay. It's just good grief. They, but it's weird to do it while the guy's still alive and, and young. I mean, he's not even, I don't even think he's 50 he's, you know, he's alive and well and they're doing a story on his life and they're changing everything around monkey in reality. That's just crazy. Yeah. It's just something that just happens. There's so much money involved in Hollywood. It's just why when, when a show like, like game of Thrones, when a show like that comes off, it's almost like, like how did this happen? Like how did they make such a perfect show in spite of all the madness that's involved in Hollywood? Like how did they figure out how to do something sold good.

Speaker 1:          00:38:46       I don't know. I mean look at, even recently I was reading a thing about all these, like that movie Jupiter ascending, another dog piling Channing Tatum today. But um, it just became, uh, it just came out and it was something like 80 or $100 million. I Dunno if, if we know the actual budget and it's like it's opening weekend made like 10 million. And it's like, why are you spending that much money? Like what was it, ah, some Scifi movie. I don't know if it was, what if he was based on something? It probably was since everything is nowadays, but you know to, for something to cost that much. I mean that raises the expectations so much. But it's probably because everyone's going, we got all this money invested, we've got to fuck with this, we got to do this and change that and you know, whatever, whatever. So it's kind of sad that then, you know, you get a small thing, don't, I don't want to say game of Thrones is small, but it's like, you know, how is it that that's, like you said, it's able to be something so perfect, be something of a high quality.

Speaker 1:          00:39:46       It's, it can be done, but they just fuck with it too much.

Speaker 3:          00:39:50       Well, I think game of Thrones is also HBO and Hbo seems to be, I mean, it's just from an outside perspective, I'm never worked for them. They just seem smarter. They seem smarter with their choices. I mean, they put on the soprano's back when there was nothing like that. Yeah. You know, the, their choices have been like, they very rarely have a dud on HBO. And I'm like, when was the last dud show that HBO put out? I don't know. Yeah. See it's like you can think of a million shitbag sitcoms and NBC fucking diarrhea it out onto America. Right. You know, you can literally, you could just sit down with a pen and paper and write down how many CBS shows made you want it to open up a fucking vain. You know, like if somebody made you watch, you know, Mike and Molly every day for the rest of your life or jump off a bridge like you'd have to go. All right. How many, how long has an episode? It's 30 minutes. All right, I'll watch it. Billy Gardell is funny though. He is funny. He's a great guy. Well, the girl is funny too, but it's, it's one of those shows, it's like they make these mass produced white bread, mayonnaise, sandwich shows.

Speaker 1:          00:40:56       Well, and they're doing 26 episodes, so five seasons into it. That's well over a hundred episodes that they've done. It's like, wha what more do we need to see out of these characters? When you look at game of Thrones though, what, what season are we about to start? Season four or five and they've only done 10 episodes a season.

Speaker 3:          00:41:11       Right. So it's so epic though. They have so many CGI things and the theory, it's a great show from top to bottom. It's a, you must be an insanely expensive show to make it like that. The war with the fucking giants and they're the fucking Rashad giant arrows at these things that are coming through the walls and chasing people and areas. Shit, man. Oh Man. It's such a God damn good show. But like, it's interesting like a show like, like a Mike and Molly, like Billy Gardell, who's a very funny standup comic and a great guy. Nobody knows who he is, right? But everyone knows who that Melissa McCarthy girl is. She's on the cover of fucking rolling stone. She's in every other Sandra Bullock movie. You know, it's, it's, it's weird how that happens. Like one character from one of those shows will take off and the other one is a, oh, that's that chick's husband. Yeah. You know, it is weird. It's Hollywood. I mean, how do you explain it? How do you explain it? Josh? Mcdermitt you're in Hollywood.

Speaker 1:          00:42:12       I don't know. I don't know man. Don't put me on the spot

Speaker 3:          00:42:15       being an INS Hollywood insider too. Like do you get like what did you get people that are coming up to you now because you're on the walking dead and go, hey man, I got this script. I mean if you could just get it to those guys or respect.

Speaker 1:          00:42:26       Yeah, to a point. I mean I get a, I get hit up for things a lot. Like I, I was telling Brian, I was doing a show tonight and I haven't done standup in a while. It's been a long time, but the reason I agreed to do this show is cause he's like, dude, I'm not going to promote you. I'm not going to say you're on the show. Whatever, you know, I won't put you on the flyer. I was like cool, low expectations, but I'm getting hit up to do shows with these guys. They want to make me the headliner. They want me to, they want to use me to promote their show. I get it. But like I, I'm going to go up there and shit the bed, if you put me at the headline, I haven't performed in a year. Yeah, he has gone up for a year and you don't miss it that you didn't miss it at all.

Speaker 1:          00:43:07       He said miss it. Does that scare you? But I mean were you like, I mean cause comedy was your thing before this that yeah, I mean it, it scares me a little bit but I mean I just was getting so burned out on it about doing standup in La and like I would go on the road and I would love being on the road and you get to do a real show and you get to work on new material and you get to like, you know, have fun and then you come back to la. And I was just like wanting to kill myself. Why shows I hated doing standup in La. I don't know what it was. I would never have a good show. I could never work on new material. I, you know, honestly what I would do, the ice house shows, those were like the, the best of the shows that I would do.

Speaker 1:          00:43:48       But then I'm like, you know, I live, I live on one side of the town and it's the shows on the other items. Like on a Friday night, I get to drive out there, but you know, it just, and it wasn't what I wanted to be doing. Ultimately I want to be acting. So I just, so when you kind of got into stand to act or once you started acting, you realize you liked it. But a little of both. I think, you know, I, I loved doing stand up, you know, I did it for 12 years and then I was like, you know, but I do want to eventually be acting, you know? So it wasn't like, oh, I'm going to use this to get in the door. It was just like, I'm going to do stand up and I also want to act. But then when I started kind of dislike, stand up, at least in La, I started love acting more. What's your, what was your, with standup in La,

Speaker 3:          00:44:32       like you said you can't do new material. Like what do you worry about? People are watching and they're worried that you're gonna fuck up.

Speaker 1:          00:44:39       No, it was like a weird, um, I don't know. I would like, I would just do a show and I'd run new material. I mean, I don't know what your success rate is. I mean, you've been doing standup for what, 26 years, 26 years. So I don't know what your success rate is on a new bit that you, right. If you're going up and it's like, let's say you're going to try out 10 new minutes, you know, to seven minutes of it usually work or does three minutes of it usually work off the bat? Like what is

Speaker 3:          00:45:05       completely varies. I mean, one week it can be one minute and the next week it could be all 10 week to week. It varies, uh, topic to topic. It varies. It to me, it's all about how inspired I am by what I'm talking about. And if I'm very inspired, then I'll find what the energy is in whatever the subject is and if I'm not inspired. But I know what you're saying about there's, there's a sort of over it that the Hollywood crowds have la celebrity. Well they want to see Louis C K or if there was fraud, they're over it. They're over it. They've seen a million of them before. They're not, they don't laugh as much. I mean I've seen like at the comedy store, literally a whole table full of people. Like you know, especially if you're watching the back that are just sitting there like this with their arms crossed, like a whole table full, like not having fun, not enthusiastic, but you go to Pasadena, which is only half hour away and everybody's having a great time to go to Irvine.

Speaker 3:          00:46:02       It's only 40 minutes away. Everybody's having a great time. It's just this, this one center, the La Center, the TMZ, the 30 miles. Oh, it's also like these people, a good percentage of them want to be in show business themselves. Yeah. And people like this fucking friend who's an actor and it's impossible to watch movies with this fuck. Because he was like, oh, whatever happened to that guy, his career like Jesus Christ, can you watch the fucking movie man? What about your career shithead? Yeah. You know, you're, you don't even have a fucking career and you're shitting on this guy who was in Jurassic Park to stop, you know, you can't, they're, they're so self obsessed that they can't even just enjoy a show and joy a movie. Right. You know, it has to be something about careers or you know, the arc of their life's history. I mean, it can't just be,

Speaker 1:          00:46:56       it comes a human nature thing that we want to like pick apart other people in their successes. But it's like heightened when you're in Los Angeles and you're just constantly bombarded with people doing what you're setting out to do and maybe, you know, you're reminded of your failures and that sort of thing. I mean, it could be that too.

Speaker 3:          00:47:11       Oh for sure. I mean they look at you and like, she got fucking lucky on that show. Dude. I could have done that. What do you do when you're playing a fucking weird guy? Yeah, I could do that. Yeah, Bro. If I was there, I fucking, I guess what if I was in the fucking audition room before you do it, I probably would have got that. So fuck off now you hear that. I take your order.

Speaker 1:          00:47:31       You hear that? Well you definitely do. You, you know, you get definitely get people that for some reason resent you for, you know, going to the audition, getting on the show and they're watching you on television. They've seen you in real life and they're like, man, that had been the perfect show for me. Yeah. For the most part though, the fans have been great, but there are those guys, those, those people just like at least centered in Los Angeles where you're just like, you know, you're, you encounter them and they are completely negative and I could have done that, you know, whatever, whatever. But you know, when I say I didn't miss it, it's not that, you know, it's not like I was just sitting on my couch. I was doing something really fun. Right. You know, so I was like, it's not like I had this thing talking to me.

Speaker 1:          00:48:13       I had like a, an open invitation to go do the clubs in Atlanta when I was living there. And um, I just never was able to make it. I was exhausted all the time. Yeah. When you, what are the long hours like you do, you guys are working on set? I mean I'm, I'm usually up like at three 30 in the morning and half an hour south to um, where we shoot you because we live in Atlanta, but we shoot an hour south. I mean I could live down where we shoot, but there's like literally nothing to do. I would go crazy. So, you know, I just do a quick little drive back up to Atlanta. But uh, so you're up at three 30 in the [inaudible] 30 in the morning, get down their father. Yeah. I'm one of the first guys on set cause I got, they got to put my mullet in, you know, literally they need time to put the mullet man.

Speaker 1:          00:48:59       If I just grow out a mullet for real, I fucking save a lot of, I don't want to have a social life, but that mullet out and people would be like, I know I throw a hat on and then that no one knows. But if I walk around with that guy who plays Abraham might cutlets and he's got that handlebar mustache, like he can't get away from it at all. I can put a hat on. No one knows. But he, he can't get away from that mustache orange, you know. Does he have to wear that mustache all year round? Yeah. Oh yeah. So right now he's grown it out like in a beard. So when you get to, like, when you get to the end of the season, how much time do you guys have between the, you're wrapped for the season and how much downtime do you have?

Speaker 1:          00:49:40       Well, we wrapped in Nov, uh, like right the week before thanksgiving, so November. And then, um, the show doesn't come back until late April. And so do you have like a contract clause? Like, you can't gain weight, you can't shave your head. You can't, yeah. There's some stuff. I mean I think, I don't know specifically those sorts of things I think is just how common sense. Right? Yeah. Don't gain weight. Don't lose weight, don't cut your hair. You don't get crazy. This is a show looking for people to kill off. I don't want to give them a reason like come back and um, I looked like Chris Pratt, I'm ripped. All of a sudden they're like on and that they would probably work that in this storyline. Maybe you could be dancing. I would. Magic Mike's style. Yeah, I would. I mean I, I find a believable, if someone's going to lose weight, like, I don't know if you've watched lost, but that Guy Hurley never lost weight gained

Speaker 4:          00:50:27       weight actually. Well it's cause he got money and he started eating good. Yeah. That's what happened. Was, is, you know, it's like they're on a desert island. Like your, you would lose weight a lot. A lot fucking way. Yeah. You're just eating pineapple all the time or whatever. Like just lose the weight. There's no gluten on an island, right? Every island is gluten free. Cookies a bring your own gluten or you get none. That guy like, it's sad when you see a guy like that because you know like that guy's so typecast and so, so morbidly obese. It's like you, you were on a huge show, last giant show and then nothing, nothing. Why him and the Asian guy who's on both on that show, it's weird. It's like lost, but now they're cops like recurring. So they probably kept him in a while like, look, you're in Hawaii already and you want to work here.

Speaker 4:          00:51:19       Yeah, exactly. Because I saw him, he in Burbank the other day and I think it was on a date or something like that. And he, he's the girl is with like literally came up to his belt. It was just this little small girl and he's this huge big Joey Diaz guy. He's way bigger than Jody is. Weighed like twice his size. Ralphie may style more than joy. God, how tall is he? Is he a tall guy? He's tall. Taller than me. I was way taller than I thought. He was. Wonder how much he weighs? 500 pounds, whatever you think. 500 it's a big boy. 400 at least. Joey got to like four 50 good. You know the, when Joey was at his largest, he was, you know, people get big. It's a lot of God damn weight. I used to weight 300 did you realize holy shit. And then I went down to two 20 I mean I dropped like 80 pounds.

Speaker 4:          00:52:02       What did you doing? Just, you know what, it's, it's this fad thing called eating right and exercising people should try it. But you know what, I got a problem with eating Mexican food and overeating and all that stuff. So, and then just being lazy. So then I yo Yo, I get back up to, to 60 and then I go to two 40 and I'm just all over the place, you know? But my dad's a huge guy and I got big guys in my family. I'm just afraid that I'm kind of in a sense predisposed disposition to do that unless I work my ass off. Yeah. Jeans or a motherfucker, dude, you see some people like you see their kids are kids are three and they have these gigantic Michelin tire arms and you're like fuck. I mean a lot of it has to be diet, but it's very clear that some people can eat anything they fucking want and never gain any weight at all.

Speaker 4:          00:52:47       Well they show these kids on Maury Povich where like he's like trying to confront the parents. So these obese children and then they just like have the kid in the green room and they're just, they set a camera on them and there's this giant bowl of Cheetos and the kid's two years old and he weighs 80 pounds and he's just like wolfing down Cheetos and it's like, that's like every day for them. That shit is so bad for you. Most of the American snacks that you buy, like most like Cheetos and Doritos and all that stuff, it's just if they're filled with hydrogenated oils and fucking fats that your body has a really hard time digesting and artificial colors. Your body's like, what the fuck is the diarrhea? Your body just has no idea what to do with it all. But sometimes it's so good, dude.

Speaker 4:          00:53:33       Spicy Doritos. Oh Dude, forget about it. Especially if you're high, you're high and you just, you're hungry and you open the cabinet and there, there you go. Yes. Yeah. You don't even think you just cook. Give it to me. I never, I never buy that stuff. But if I see it out, like if, if there was a bag of Doritos here, I'd eat the whole thing. The craft service table at the walking dead worst man. Do you have a craft service table out in the sun? Like how does that work? Yeah, it's um, they just, well they put a tent over it, but yeah, they just have and you can order anything you want. You can say, give me a grilled cheese sandwich or a case study or they'll go make it for you. And so I always try to have someone else order for me so that they order something healthy.

Speaker 4:          00:54:14       Uh, otherwise I'm ordering, you know, chicken case ideas and then I ordered something else. But, um, so then of course like the actor thing is to get like Turkey wrapped in lettuce. That's the avocado. All the actors eat that. Yeah, that's hilarious. They try to pretend they're eating healthy. I am healthy. I'm not like you, I'm so superior. I have all these healthy fats, Omega threes bro. I graze though. That's a problem I always had with the fucking craft service tables. I would just graze and it'd be upset at myself. Like why did I just eat ADM and m's? Cause that's what they, that's what they put out. They're there and you're just like, you get a handful, you're like, all right. You'd like justify them. It's going to have a handful. Then you're like, oh shit, I got another hand. So you scoop out some more.

Speaker 4:          00:55:02       You know it's, I have, I have the biggest problem with all that stuff. Kevin James brought a fucking trailer on his, uh, when he, one of his movies and the trailer, it was like, you know, like a regular big moving trailer and it was filled with exercise equipment. Oh, I thought you were going to say just how close it ring dings fucking doughnut. They do that like the rock does that he's got a whole trailer or will Smith might have like a big bus full. Yeah, that's great. Well I think that's where Kevin got it from. I think he got it from will Smith when he did that movie with Will Smith and he was pretty inspired by that guy. But um, I think that's a common thing. They have these trailers that they rent and you get in them and they have everything and they had a tanning booth in it too.

Speaker 4:          00:55:46       Oh my God. That's over the top. You can go lie down and get a Tan, but you can, you know, you could get like a full workout in right there on the set. So like he was doing that. Here comes the boom movie where he had to play a fighter. Oh yeah. He lost a shit load of weight, gained it way back, like double time. I just saw the preview for that. For some reason they made a sequel to Paul Black or the male mall cop sequel. You know, holy cow, he's big. He got big, he got a big, I mean, why did he lose weight? Was it because of, uh, gained the weight back? Was it because of habits or is it because maybe he thought he's not that funny if he's skinny or like, you

Speaker 1:          00:56:23       know what I mean? Like that's the kind of mentality that people have, at least in this industry sometimes. Like I'm a funny fat guy. I'm not going to be a funny skinny guy

Speaker 3:          00:56:32       when I, you know, Kevin and I, when we were young, um, when we first moved to La in like the 1990s, um, he had an agent at the time that I talked to him in a firing. But, uh, that's one of the things that his agent said to him, when you're losing weight, you're losing roles. Oh, he told them not to be healthy because it's bad for your career. And He, and I was saying, do you look around, look at all these people on TV? Yeah. Are they all fat? Is it the only way to be on TV? Do you have to be fat? W what are you telling me? You're not going to be funny if you get skinny. You're funny. You're funny. Cause your brain dude, your brain's going to work better if your skin here. It's for him. Kevin doesn't have any real vices.

Speaker 3:          00:57:08       Like he doesn't drink, he doesn't smoke weed. He doesn't like to do drugs. He's his thing. His food, he fucking loves food. The way he talks about food is like the way a guy who is getting out of 20 years in prison talks about the first sex he's going to have. Right. You know he talks about this fucking his chicken parm sandwiches. They got this, this crust they have on them. It's fucking just golden brown toes did not bar but just slightly, slightly brown and the sauce, the sauce and the melted Mozzarella Cheese and oh, he'll talk about it like he just, he told me about the best cheeseburger place in Encino and there's apparently this doughnut place and Encino, Lucky's or something like that. And they also have cheeseburgers. I never went there because you know the fuck, it's just a cheeseburger. I'm not traveling for a cheeseburger. I mean, how good could it be? Yeah. But listening to him describe it almost got me to drive there. It was like it like porn to him. It's like porn. It's clearly a vice.

Speaker 1:          00:58:08       Well that was the problem. John Candy had, you know it's a common problem there was, I was talking to, there was that movie he did summer rental and I'm like 1984 or something. And he was literally at his skinniest. He's like ever been in any of his movies when he was doing that movie. I was talking to the guy who wrote that and it was like one of the producers and he said every day they would go in, you know, break into his hotel room while he's on set and steal all the like food that he had taken from the settled. Yeah. And like he had like he showed up with suitcases full of junk food, like at several suitcases and they're like, they had to literally take that stuff away from him so that he wouldn't need it and like Yo yo is weight while they were shooting out of sequence or whatever like and he was at a skinniest anyway, he was still a big guy, but some people have a problem with, I've got a problem with it man. And he's still ate himself to death. Yeah. Well I mean John Candy died pretty young. I mean I don't even think he was 50 wasn't it? He was like 44 or something like that. All from fat and I'll just eating himself to death. He was so funny though. Goddamn. That was funny. Planes, trains and automobiles like God, he was hilarious. My buddies and I will do a John Candy movie night every once in a while. Just watch the John Candy movie.

Speaker 3:          00:59:22       Great outdoors. Yeah. I mean everything in home alone, the poker, the poker. It's so good, man. Uncle Buck is great. They're doing an uncle buck show now. They did an uncle buck show way back in the day. Yeah. With somebody else. That's weird. Well, maybe they feel like enough times pass now. I think it was Jim Belushi or something like that. Oh really? Yeah. Oh, I don't know that. That would have worked. Well, obviously it didn't know. Hold on a second. Uncle Buck TV show. Oh, it was Kevin Meeney. Oh, poor Kevin Christ. Yeah, that was 1989 I'll all African American uncle buck show coming soon. No, African American. They're doing a I Annie. That's the new thing. Christ. That's hilarious. That's weird. That's hilarious. How they do that. Not that, I mean, not that it needs to be a white show, but it's like it just, it's so calculated. Just make another show, make a show, and if I hire the best actors, meanwhile salon.com will praise it for its diversity.

Speaker 3:          01:00:21       It's amazing what they've done better than the original because everyone's in minority. Yeah. That show blackish is pretty funny. That's a funny show. But that show would be funny. I mean, it's original. It's a for, you know, it's a first run. They've no one's ever done it before their show. They created all the characters. Ian Edwards writes on it, you know? Yeah. Lawrence Lawrence Fish Burns on his films right next to my house. They've good fucking show, but it's like they've got good writers. It's well done. I mean, it would be well done if they were Chinese people be well done if they were Polish right. It's just a good show. I can't wait until racism stops and dies down to the point where it's no longer addressed because it's so fucking annoying watching shows that are so clearly in response to like the the Brownie points you're going to get, the Social Brownie points you're going to get for showing diversity.

Speaker 3:          01:01:14       It's not, the diversity was like it was important because it needs to be done. It's almost like it's done just to kind of like score, you know? It's done to like, look what he'd done. Look, we've got to be a woman and she's Asian and she runs the show. Well, there's a black woman president. Our show. Yeah, the woman President United States is black and it's a woman on our show. It's like, I see what you're doing. Okay, you're doing like card tricks. Okay, let's stop calling attention to it. Getting those good point. Yeah, just make it good. It's Duh Duh. Like racism is bad. Duh. I can't wait until it's done. You know, like, I mean, who the fuck do you know that's racist in this day and age? If I was hanging out with some, Anthony Kumi might be a little race, a little bit, a little bit, but the old school comics he's experienced that guys experienced a lot of shit.

Speaker 3:          01:02:07       Being a white guy living in New York and looking like him, things get rough. But I think that, and hopefully in our lifetime it'll get to a point where people will, other reasons to separate, you know, the, the, the idea of like right now you've got people that separate because of conservative and liberal. You've got people that separate because of religious and atheist. So you've got people that celebrate, set up separate rather because of a Vegan and meat eater. You know, you've got all these little factions and groups that separate from each other. You know, Seattle fans versus patriots. I mean, this is essentially, we like to be in these weird little groups and the group of white people, just, just white people that don't like minorities. Like God damn, that's a fucking stupid group. Like in a group of black people that don't like white people.

Speaker 3:          01:03:01       Like that's a fucking dumb group too. Yeah. He's, this groups are dumb. Like the, the idea of you're just one aspect of your appearance or one aspect of your, uh, your ethnic origin. It's one of the dumbest fucking things to like associate with and it's, it's tiresome. And the response to it, the, the, the opposite response to it is almost just as tiresome. It's almost like just we need to get to a point where it's not an issue anymore. So that these, like the making a black uncle buck is going to, you know, people gotta go, why would you do that? Why don't you just make uncle frank, you know, make a new fucking show. Right. You know, you'd have to, it doesn't have to be uncle buck. It's not John Candy. It's not even Kevin Meeney stop stopped. Kevin Meeney gets, gets inserted into this argument against his will. When only that laid me out of him. Find me a black guy named buck. Right. Are there black guys named buck? Okay, let's, let's Google black guys named buck. I'm never even met a white guy. I mean all the bucks have been like buck Rogers, uncle buck like from the fucking fifties. I when I worked at the radio station in Phoenix, uh, it was owned by Buck Owens, the legendary country, sir. Wow. Images for black guys named buck. It's quite a few.

Speaker 3:          01:04:26       There's some fucking ridiculous images of black gentleman named buck. Now it's a lot of white people. The Jack Johnsons in there. His name's not buck. Fuck you. This is ridiculous. Fits as a Google image search. Black guys name Buck, and then pictures of Christina Hendricks. Boobs come up. And then buck angel. Do you know buck? So Buck Angel Angel was on the podcast. Used to be a woman is now man. Oh Wow. Transgender porn star. All yoked and shit. Pretty rare. Really good guy too. Yeah. Fun Guy to hang out with. Talk to named buck black white as fuck. But I Google black guys named buck. Nope. There's so few black guys named buck do. You don't even get past the first page. The first you get one row of black people before you get white folks. Right. And couple of them look at those photos. Yeah. They might not even be really named buck. Just be black people. Yeah. Those are just buckeyes. Those Ohio state. It's true. So Ohio state, just two of them were Ohio state and two of them are like pictures from back when they, you know, one of them said one of them is a, is a whole website on blackface.

Speaker 7:          01:05:39       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:05:39       Well the history of blackface, that's where the image comes from, which has got, okay, so the, okay, so that guy buck was not even, oh, he was a black man.

Speaker 7:          01:05:50       All right.

Speaker 3:          01:05:52       Black is a weird thing. Like you can't do black face today. Like someone was playing a character like a, at a, a party, like a Halloween party and they put blackface on and um, they got fired from their job because you, you can't pretend to be a black person. Like you cannot have black person makeup on if you are a white person. I successfully did it cause I was at black wizard though. Now you didn't successfully do it dude. Nobody knew about it. Nobody knew about it. When you can't get fired from your job, you work for me. No, I mean I mean I went to parties and never went. No one ever said anything because I was playing almost like a superhero kind of character, you know. But it was a black face and heart is did you go to though the southpark party and then I went to a couple bars, Gilmore more girls.

Speaker 3:          01:06:39       Let's see here what I'm saying, like you're not working for a company. What I'm saying is that there was a company and they had a party and they had a Halloween party and this guy showed up in blackface and they fired him and it was this issue like like, come on man, he's, he's playing like Mr t, you know, we had like gold chains on and everything and he put black skin colored makeup on. You cannot, you literally cannot do that. You can pretend to be from avatar. You can pretend to be a lot of things, which you can't pretend to be as a black person. You cannot darken your skin color. Yeah, that's a weird, that's a weird fucking rule. And Oh, you and be your, when you say this, and I've said this before on the podcast and people will fucking freak out, and the ultra sensitive search, social justice warrior types, we'll start tweeting.

Speaker 3:          01:07:21       You do not understand that. You sit ignorant. You don't understand the context of where black blackface gained from, how offensive it is to people of color. Fuck off. Fuck off with your fake sensitivity. I know what you're doing. You brownie points search and for assholes it's just skin. It's just the color of skin. It's preposterous. The idea that you can't play Denzel Washington, you can't like, you can't do it. You can't ever do it. You'd be, you have to be the white Denzel Washington does. Like what if I want to play Denzel Washington for Halloween? I can't do it. I'm a huge Denzel Washington Fan. I loved all his motor girl could, no, they can't get away with, if they're doing black face with a, as a guy as Denzel Washington, I doubt it. There was no certainty. Who's that actress that just got in trouble this year for Halloween? She did black face. Uh, Julian is the new black. Yeah. Oh yeah. She, she learns. So someone

Speaker 1:          01:08:16       from orange is the new black, but she didn't, did she get in trouble or was that she was on TMZ about it. It was all over the place about it. Have you been following the gender thing at all, Joe?

Speaker 3:          01:08:25       Of course. I have this, I'm white teens in blackface. Yeah, there's a, there's a bunch of these Missouri high school girls wear blackface. Outrage. Outrage as a white high school seniors in Missouri show up for girls powder puff football game in blackface. Look at this. Don't Cook People in Missouri that think they can. They just think they can fucking do anything like, well shit, we're in Missouri. We don't have to follow your liberal rule

Speaker 1:          01:08:58       anywhere near Ferguson. I mean they do. They not watch the news too. They're not. No. They're not interested. The racial tensions that are taking place within their state. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:09:06       They're like, I'm staying in this town. I ain't moving from this town. This is where where I live. They're all wearing blackface and they have teachers around them that are all smiling. The images of white girls with their faces painted black was posted on social penia sparking outrage. This is like some serious blackface though. They didn't even bother doing the neck. No, they're just black face. They're not pretending. It's not called black men, not black wrist. And that was a conversation they had her arms. Everything is white. Everything is white, black or this. Some of them have like a black long sleeve shirt on. Yeah. But they don't have gloves. That chick planned ahead. Two of them did. It's fucking, I dunno man. I mean, look, racism is absolutely disgusting, but you give a lot of people a lot of power when you allow them.

Speaker 3:          01:09:56       You know, when you get so upset, the principal said nothing racial. This is hilarious. Oh my God. From the fucking principle. Nothing racial about the powder puff team wearing blackface. Oh really? I was nothing racial. They're pretending to be a different race than they are. That's very racial. That's inherently racial. There's no way getting around racial. But here's the thing, it's not bad to be black. Okay, so why would taking makeup and turning your skin black be bad? I could get, this is a racist context to it, but it when, when is that dissolve? I mean, at one point in time, do we culturally just step back and say like, this is ridiculous. Somebody wants to be fucking Mr t. If you're black and you're hanging around with a bunch of white people in there were legitimately your friends and you love them, and one of them decides to be mister t for Halloween and shows up with a bunch of gold chains.

Speaker 3:          01:10:46       He's got a Mohawk on and he's got black face on. Right? Are you going to beat him up and get to beat your friend out for being racially insensitive? I mean, are we really living in that fucking retarded? A world where that's such a huge issue. It just seems racism is disgusting. Racism is evil, but someone playing another race by putting makeup on their skin. The only way that would be negative at all, the only way is if there was something wrong with being that race. There's clearly nothing with being a black person. So someone who is white putting black makeup on, it's not like they're, it's not like they're doing al Jolson and they're putting white around their lips and black in there. Man, they're there. They're doing some sort of a fucking horrible racial racist or mass. Uh, yeah, exactly. Obviously you exactly this, this person who got fired, he was playing a famous black person, but it's out of bounds.

Speaker 3:          01:11:42       Like you cannot do it. You can't do it. There's a witch hunt going on in this country. You know, just like the moment someone mentions any sort of race, you're racist. It's such a great way to diffuse someone and take all the onus off them, take all of the possible scrutiny or criticism that might come their way and point it all at you. It's also a great way to diffuse your argument. Just call you a racist. You know, like if, if you have a different opinion about Ferguson or about, you know, economics or Al Sharpton or any, anything that involves a black person instantaneously, your arguments diffused. If they call you racist. Yeah. Well, Josh Mcdermitt, you're a racist. You're from Phoenix, Arizona, one of the most racist states. Come on, man, you're a racist, fake. Why don't you just own up to your racism, man? Yeah. There's no way around that. You can sit there and argue it and they just keep throwing that back at you and you get, you could get hashtag black lives matter tattooed on your forearm.

Speaker 3:          01:12:46       People sign till they would still go after it. There was still it's cause it's, it's a way that people, instead of it being a rational thing. Who was that Ted Danson. Oh that's right. Black face when he was dating Whoopi Goldberg did it on TV. Yes. Well he had a pass. He thought because he was dating wipie he's like, look at her, I'm fucking her. I should be able to do something about this. Ah, I forgot about that. That kind of started it all. I feel like that's starting to dance. It's fault. Well the, I mean it was offensive at one point in time, especially because at one point in time that was the only way you saw black people represented on TV. It was a white person playing a black person or in movies was, or they were slaves, you know. I mean you had like go back like other races, like go back and watch John Wayne played Gingiss con you told me that's not fucking offensive. He's playing a Mongol and he's clearly this fucking corn fed white guy from America and he's playing like one of the most important historical conquerors ever. Right. And he's playing them out of the race. He doesn't even have makeup on. I mean, he's not even fucking pretending. At least the guy who played Jackie or um, uh, Charlie Chan, like they did something to them to make them look more Chinese, you know? But John Wayne, they just said fuck it. It's John Wayne was, he's gang guys. Can that to a, yeah, I mean

Speaker 3:          01:14:12       if you ever watched it. No I haven't. Oh, it's Gloria. I think I've seen pictures, but yeah, I haven't seen it is glorious and it's stupidity. It's so fucking bad. It's so bad. And you realize like it was one of those Elvis movies where they would just fucking slapped together. There was a point in time where they would slap together a movie, have Elvis in it and just, you know, Elvis is a football star and we've got a wooden the scream, we've got to look in this case. And Elvis was started dancing. They would do that with John Wayne. I mean they would, they would let John Wayne play Gingiss Khan and one of the shittiest fucking movies of all time. Or they just didn't, they didn't do any makeup. They didn't like darkness scan once. Yeah, Jamie, pull it up and put it on the screen. So only we see it. So the, the folks in, so we don't get pulled from youtube. If you have a videos that people have copyright on them and you play them and then you upload it even from a podcast where you're talking about it, he played on Youtube, they pull, it sucks. Yeah. But we'll, we'll put it up on here. Just, just for the, he, he's in the hos because you got to see how fucking bad it is.

Speaker 8:          01:15:15       LG USA low though. That's crazy. It takes me back. That's the USA logo. And remember that same movie. Oh Wow. That's graphic.

Speaker 3:          01:15:38       Yeah. He just had the chew man Fu Mustache. That's the only Fu Manchu and Manchu.

Speaker 3:          01:15:45       Yeah. Madison is a stupid and he's banging white chicks. Super White. Look how hot Cheetos, God damn women that were hot back then too. There were hot in a different way, man. They were, they were hot in this like supernatural. Like when you say hourglass really was like an hourglass cause they had about an hour until they turn into old ladies. They didn't last. Like I was out of fucking of restaurant the other day. Um, and uh, I saw Cindy Crawford and I don't know how old Cindy Crawford is. Well, I want to Google right now. I'm going to guess 50. Make us 40. No, she, she's at least 50. Um, she is hot as fuck. She's 48. Dude. She's hot as fuck. Yeah. Like she's hot like 25 year old hot. Right. Because that bitch is probably running stairs every day, doing yoga, getting her face. Sandblasted getting stem cells from aborted fetuses, sprayed all over cheekbones. I mean, I don't know what she's doing. Whatever she's doing, she needs to write a book because at 48 she's fucking stunning. She's stunning. She's a year older than me and I look like, shit,

Speaker 9:          01:16:57       let's go. Come on. You look good. I mean, I don't look totally Shitty, but oh, I just don't look as good as I looked last year. That's all I'm saying. That's fishing for compliments. That was the whole point.

Speaker 4:          01:17:10       I'm going to make them a story about seeing her at the restaurants and they're telling me, I look at it by her body's in check or faces in check, like there's nothing sadder than you. You run into, I won't say the name, but I ran into this woman who was a major movie star in the 90s now she is enormous. I mean, she's probably 50 60 pounds overweight or face licked, all fucked up. And she looked like she smoked cigarettes and just, and I was like, no, that's not. No, because before she was just dawning, you would see here and just go, good Lord. And now it's just, yeah, same thing just happened to me with the girlfriend, Wayne's world. Oh, really? See them. They're all white. They want to know who it is that you're talking about. Did big, wide wasted lazy fucking, who is it?

Speaker 4:          01:17:56       Just say here, this shitty food down or radio. It is. I can't think she lives in my neighborhood. You still talked to Betty White? Betty White, you know Betty White? He used to be on a show with her. No, I wasn't. I was on a net. I was on the same network, but we would do parties. What's the show that used to do the retired at 35. It was, um, I thought she was on that show. What does retired at 35. It was a Sitcom I was on. Um, we went two seasons with George Segal who was on that show. Just shoot me and then I can't think of the woman's name. Jessica Walter who was from Archer and uh, uh, arrested development. She plays a mom and all that. She was red, but Betty, I don't know Betty. Yeah, I just saw the Betty White nudes. Somebody sent me the other day and her naked when she was younger.

Speaker 4:          01:18:39       Beautiful. She's beautiful by white. Had nudes. She has a lot of them and there's like, it's like really whoa, those are real. Yeah. Yeah. She's really, she's just a beautiful person. The casting couch was a real thing back then. It really was, but still real, right? Yeah, it's still is. It must be. I mean I'm probably not for like big budget movies probably so probably for like everything man. Stuff like the conqueror. It's kind of implied though, right? Isn't that the thing about the casting couch? Just not as simple as like, hey look, get on that couch and chuck, Mr [inaudible]. Right. I think it's put you in x men five. No it doesn't. You know, is he gay? I don't know. I mean I think he just likes parties with naked boys, young boys in oak tub filled with blood. Did you see the, the, the pool is like red lights in the pool and he's like, I'm like running around banging each other.

Speaker 4:          01:19:33       I'm like, God, I say why not? And we're still asking if he's gay. Oh he's gay. He's gay as fuck. He's gay as fuck. Cause I taught there was, I dunno, there was, I mean this is how stupid and out of the loop I am. But I thought there was something that like, I just assumed he was based on these allegations and all of the things he went through. And then there was something where it's like, oh a god. Ah, why not all blow up bud, but whole blood. That's what I'm saying. It's crazy. Red Lights, red lights. Well they probably put fucking die in there too. You know, they'd probably

Speaker 3:          01:20:08       put dye in the pool. Let's look a fun time guys having a good fucking time, man. He's, I see a couple of gals there too. A couple of not enough. Wow. A couple of gals who want to be able to have fun and not have people try to put this guy in the foreground with his hair. Like what? That's a bad haircut. Shave your head homie. Just let it go. So over, trust me when it's over, it's over. But you know, like these guys that he, you know, he banged that he, that he brought to these parties, they would get upset. But I think the thing was that there were underage, there were like younger than 18 that was like the, the real issue. But you know, that's one thing about underage sex. People give zero fucks if you're an under aged gay boy, I feel like a 17 year old gay guy likes to blow Hollywood dudes.

Speaker 3:          01:20:56       Right? But if you were like a girl and some Mel Gibson type guy, some big Hollywood celebrity guy had parties and add a pool filled with 16 year old girls and he was banging. I mean that would be the end. Yeah, that'd be the end. Absolutely. But if it's boys, I'm like, Damn. They wanted one of their owners. They have boners at 17 they all gained, they're all gay, right? There's no, no one, no one got roofied. Okay. Yeah. Were before we're done here, get out of here. Get out of here. He had texted me, I was 18 did you have sex with you when you were 19 and then 20 and 21 yeah. Okay. We're good. It's the same thing. Same thing happened. You didn't know what was going on. Was it the first time you'd ever had sex? No. Did He, did he give you some drugs?

Speaker 3:          01:21:36       Did He roofie you? Did he do something to you that's just so want to have sex with mister singer? Obvious when someone's trying to get a pay day, you know that, I mean, I don't know the details of this case, but it's like this guy like sat on this for like 15 years or something like that, didn't he? Yeah. It's just like, come on. Well, yeah. Well they definitely, I mean they feel like they're entitled, you know, it's like they, they could sue, they might be able to get money, so go for it. I don't have any money. I'm broke. Hey, I fucked Bryan singer and all of his friends in a pool six years ago when I was only 17 and you go to a lawyer and he's like, do you have any photographs from Mr Sanger and you in this pool and said pool with no clothes on.

Speaker 3:          01:22:15       As a matter of fact, I do. You pull those photos out and then they say, listen, let's go to this guy. And it's essentially, it's a money grab. You're trying to get money and like you'd say, listen, Mr Sanger, it's going to cost you about $5 million to fight off this lawsuit. We are bringing in the big guns here at Sherman and Lefkowitz and associates. You know, we have a long history of extorting money from large, rich celebrities like yourself. So let's just, uh, let's, let's call it 3 million and let's wrap this pitch up tight right now. And they make these negotiations and they fucking give him some money to fill it out and there you go. They signed some sort of a disclosure and it encourages people to continue to do that. Well, the UFC is in the middle of thinks three or four, um, class action lawsuits now.

Speaker 3:          01:23:02       So some of them, which I just don't understand what they're doing. I like guys that had no chance of ever winning a belt ever. They were, they were not that good. They were, you know, marginal fighters at best. And I don't know what they're suing over. I don't understand it. They as soon over. I think the idea is that somehow or another, the UFC stifled competition, but according to the people that I know, obviously I'm only hearing one side of it, but that it's going to cost them $25 million to fight it. And they get approached by these lawyers and a while they're going through the, you know, the whole legal issue of what, you know, what could be considered a anti competition, what couldn't be they, they start accumulating legal bills and then once the bills start getting high, then they, they pulled them together, they have a meeting and I say, look, here's the deal.

Speaker 3:          01:23:55       You know, we'll settle for 10 million and we'll settle for, you know, 9 million. What do you want to know? What do you want to do? And then they make a few million and then they fucking high five each other. They go get some hookers that they drink some wine and they go, we got another one. I mean, there's some legit class action lawsuits. Most, certainly when a products fail and people die, um, like there's a, there was one recently with Chevrolet where it turned out that they hid the fact that their ignition switches we're fucking up and a bunch of people that died because of this. And so there's like some legit class action lawsuits when it comes to certain companies. But uh, when you see Bryan singer type thing and like, okay, wait a minute, you're gay, right? You're good. He's gay. Okay. You showed up at his house and there was a bunch of gay dudes and you're all doing gay stuff.

Speaker 3:          01:24:41       Okay. And you want some money? Like you look, you get dick, that's what you get. He went to the party. You wanted to get some Dick got some Dick. You probably got some ecstasy to bonus. Okay. He probably gave you some food. You probably had some snacks. Like a sandwich is burger from this donut shop and seeing it's phenomenal mouth. You got to party in the red pool. Hopefully you didn't have to clean up after. Everybody's fine, man. You weren't the guy that has scrubbed the fucking the red stain off the side of the pool and I'm like, it was probably that Easter egg shit, you know, through the, you know when you do with kids dunk eggs, oh yesterday drop those little pellets into the water. It turns red food dye and they get out of the pool and they're just all red. He can't get away with that kind of shit anymore.

Speaker 3:          01:25:30       But back in the day, like who could you imagine if you could go back to like the 1950s in 19th like the Humphrey Bogart days, what kind of fucking chaos those parties must have been like when no, there was no accountability. The studios totally protected people. I mean, you'd have to have a dead body before shit got weird and you would literally have to have some, someone would have to be dead. And even then, and even then probably you wouldn't know about it. Yeah, I mean we first show or there must have been some stars that had to call.

Speaker 1:          01:26:03       Like what does that show that's on showtime that I'm Ray Donovan, Ray Donovan. We call the Ray Donovan Guy and Ray Donovan comes over, he fixing fucking wraps the kid up in a of of of some sort of a carpet cleaner. Yeah, they, they take it downstairs and they fucking throw it in the furnace and that's it. That's such a good show. Is it a good show? It's a great show. I only watch a couple episodes. I see what you saw. The first episode where he, he goes to the girl's stocker and he's sitting there, you want the bay, what's in the bag or the bat? And the guy goes, I'll take the bag. And then he makes them get in a bath full of like, you know, green dye or whatever. And then the guys just like, his skin is green, you know, it's not going to wash out for a while.

Speaker 1:          01:26:47       He's just humiliated and everything. That's probably what happened with the Brian Secrets Party. To be a girl celebrity I think would be really scary because there are dudes that fixate on female celebrities in a really fucking creepy way and today they can find where they live. Oh yeah. It was very easy. I was drug the other day. Joe, I told you about it and that scared the fuck out of me cause that was the first time where I actually felt like something's not right with me. I don't know what's going on. And then I wake up an hour later and I'm like, what the fuck happened? We'd like where am I? And it was, it was so scary. And I and I talked to girls about it. We're like, yeah, I've had that happen a couple times. There was a party, they have that happen all the time. They have this nail Polish.

Speaker 1:          01:27:27       No, I'm restart wearing though. I could just get my finger in and it changes color. If there's any roofie in there though. Well I think it only works for some drugs or does it work for Ghb? Like if you dip your finger in it and it's roofing all, maybe it'll work. We'll do it for everything. I think maybe each nail has a different, yeah, have a drink. Hold on. That was just my roofie nail need. Let me check my Ghb nail. Alpha males. Alpha males now have the roofie for guys. They turn, they turn hearts. Pink hearts shows up on your nail if it's, if it's a negative, but it's weird is, I told you this already, but I got roofie at a bar and it was, you know, everything just went spinny bar. Were you at? I was at jumbos clown room. Well that's a roofie hotspot. Yeah. Yeah. I mean it's, it's, it's a nice little feed themselves at Jumbos. Yeah. Just cause what am I doing with my life? Most people end up there. They've been roofie two shots of Ruthie's. Yeah. Fuck it. Let's go for something different. When you wake up, what do you got on the top shelf there?

Speaker 1:          01:28:31       Yeah. They do actually take people, Take Ruby's on purpose and, but this was completely different than who the fuck takes roof. He's on purpose. It's, it's serious. Like kids or do it as a drug. They take cap, you know, there's little, a five hour energy drinks, whatever they're called, five hour energy drinks. They fill that thing up with roofie shit. And then they take, they're called caps and they take a little cap and they put it in and makes you feel really like, uh, like, like body buzzy. Oh you mean Ghb? GHB. Yeah. Which is one of the, one of the date rape drugs. There's non,

Speaker 3:          01:29:02       yeah, right. Not roofie like roof and all that

Speaker 6:          01:29:05       bad one. Yeah. I don't know which one. Mine was. Mine Cintas was, I was uh, I was on my second or I just had my second drink and I ordered a new drink, took like one step of my third drink and then everything started getting spinning like, like by vision, almost like trippy, like, like I couldn't, like, I was like, why is it the room spoke with your drink. What were you drinking? Just a little Jack and cokes. Uh, and uh,

Speaker 3:          01:29:27       cause you were saying that so and take, they take like advising bottles and squirt it into people.

Speaker 6:          01:29:32       A bouncer told me what they do is they take advising, bottle it, fill it with whatever the crap they're using and they'll just like literally keep it in their hand, walk through and just drop like why they walk by somebody drink, just drop it in there. And uh, he said that roofing guys, roofing guys is actually, he's seen it before where like there's a guy talking to a girl they want to talk to so they'll re roughly the guy to get him out of the way. Like he'll start getting sick or whatever and go to the bathroom and I passed out.

Speaker 3:          01:29:57       Yeah. I never take drinks from people. I don't know unless I see it come from the bar, you know, into their hand into my hand is just too many Weirdos if you don't know them. Right. You know, you never know. Some people are like aggressive, but hey man, come on, do the shot. Yes, I know where that shot come from. That's shot. Could have come from Mars. I see it in your hand. I have no idea where it was before it was in your hand.

Speaker 6:          01:30:18       It's, and it's not just being roofie or you know, like you could grab a guy's drinking. Like maybe he was, you know, the other night I did, I saw a guy and he recognized me and I just, as a joke, I grabbed his drink and started drinking it and I got mad. I'm like, oh, I could he be like having the flu right now and he's still out. You know, it's, it's good to just do your own drinks. It was really weird though, because I pay, luckily it got to my car and I passed out and I, cause I couldn't see, my vision was gone. I didn't feel drunk, I didn't feel sick. I just couldn't, my eyes weren't working so close my eyes. And the next thing I know it woke up an hour later in your car, in my car and, and I felt, uh, muscle relaxer.

Speaker 3:          01:30:57       Well, you gotta be really careful about that because of a cop knock on your window. You're going to just send my backseat. Yeah, I know. Even if you're in your back seat, if you're in your car, I think if you keep your keys and put it on the roof, something like that. Yeah. I mean something completely ridiculous. But look, it's essentially they have the opportunity to arrest you for, right. It's a technicality, you know, you can tell them, look, I'm not driving. I just sat here because I knew I can't drive to like get out of the car. They arresting you. Yeah. Which is fucking really gross because you're doing the right thing. You realize you can't drive. You're just locking your door and letting yourself sober up. But there's certain Conti fuckhead cops that will drag you into jail for that. That's ridiculous. And the next day, a whole day, I just felt like I was like on muscle relaxers. It was fucked up. That's probably GHB. Yeah. Somebody probably whacked you out because, uh, I have friends who've done GHP before and they've done too much and then they just go limp. Like they'll be at a bar and then like Eddie, Eddie did it once and he did too much. Wow. And, uh, he just like,

Speaker 4:          01:32:00       like couldn't walk or his body just stopped working. This, his body's went limp. Yeah. Like my mind was normal but my body was drunk and my eyes were drunk. That's so weird, man. Do you have any idea who might've done it? No. I mean there was a lot of crazy, I mean, David Arquette was there and so I said hi to David, but there was also some people that I knew there and uh, I talked to them for a bit, but then I, I'm like been replaying it over my head over and over again and I can't think of it like, I could almost think that maybe what if I just grabbed the wrong drink? Like I grabbed a stripper's drink by mistake or something or a wow. I was trying to roofie them. Yeah. Who knows? I mean, you might have been annoying.

Speaker 4:          01:32:41       I was only there for an hour though. I like, I literally had a spot and I was driving home and I was driving by and I'm like, Oh, you know, I haven't been there in a while. I'll just go in there, have a drink or two and you stop eating by yourself. Yeah, that's a real migraine. So no, my friend, my friend, my friend's a dancer there and contortionists that's a real alcoholic will pull into jumbos or couple hours, ride out the storm. Three drinks in an hour. That could be it too. No, no, no. And these are like the small little rock glass drinks, you know? I mean I drink seven or eight of those a day. You don't know who you're dealing with here, dude. I don't, I really don't. You never drank with Brian? No. Are you a big drinker? Yeah. You want a little drunk right now?

Speaker 4:          01:33:21       No scared. Yeah. What's the matter? I'm sitting next to Brian. You're amongst friends. He didn't know I saw what you had in there. I didn't. It didn't entice me. Nothing. Makers. We've got some, some. Oh, when we put talked about on the podcast, somebody contacted me about giving us a wine cooler for, for wine. Not like a wine cooler. I wouldn't drink that cause I'm a man. I don't drink wine coolers. Now are you talking about I drank Zima if they don't even have [inaudible] anymore, it's called something else, but it's the exact same thing. It's flavor. Hard time back in the day for drinking. [inaudible] was great. Tastes good? Yeah. Did you get drunk and it taste nice. Did you remember to Kiza? Yes. What is that? What was it? It was like a Tequila beer or something. Wasn't it like Bud light made it also? It was like, yeah, it was just, it, it was a beer, but it had like lime flavoring in it and it had a, but I don't know, it was Kinda like a hint of it.

Speaker 4:          01:34:24       Tequila, I don't know if they were actually mixing the two, but um, like some of the worst hangovers I ever had came off to keys, keys, keys. It's so weird to keys up. There it is. What is this beer with a, a Gavi nectar and a natural flavor of, uh, imported Tequila. So no actual Tequila, but just flavors, right? Well, the Gavi nectar is just sweet. You know, a Gavi is, it's actually not good for you. You know when people like they don't use honey. Like when I'm mock vegans, one of the, that our mock, my, my old special was about how they don't eat like true vegans don't use honey cause they don't think it's cool to make this bs work for people. But obviously not good for you. Nope. It's sugar basically just sugar. But it's better than like Splenda or something. Would you say?

Speaker 4:          01:35:12       Nope. Nope. Nope. And in fact it away. SPLENDA, it's probably better for you cause splendid doesn't give you the reaction that you're going to get. Like the, the, the, you know, the glucose reaction. Yeah. Stevia is the best sweetener as far as like health. It's like, it's just a plant extract like Stevia. It tastes sweet, but it doesn't have any sugar in it at all. It doesn't taste that sweet. It'll look really doesn't taste as good. You know, the reality of Stevia is it's like, it's like, like a bee sweet, you know, it's not a sweet like, right. I heard that there was even a new reports that, that, that Stevia, there's good, there's bad things about Stevia now. Well that's as recent reports and research was probably done by, you know, the other companies that are getting their asses kicked. Yeah. Come on man.

Speaker 4:          01:35:58       I mean, he has bad for you. Hold on like every other week. Something else that was good for you is now bad for you. I mean, it's a real problem with these fucking people that create these tests. Um, hold on a second that we find out that the results were skewed just because someone funded them from some company that has a vested interest. Why I quit Stevia. Hmm. Okay. Let's see. Is it like for rule of, for a reasons and number four will blow your mind. Stevie attacks is the adrenals. Our bodies are not designed or evolve to handle calorie free sweeteners, be it natural or other official experiences, sweet tastes from food that is not going to provide glucose confounds our body sugar handling process, I think. I think it's like your brain pretty much goes, hey, you know, this is sugar. We need to work off the sugar.

Speaker 4:          01:36:51       But then when you go there, there's no, it's not sugar. So fucks up the, yeah, that's what they're saying. I read it wrong. It's a sweet taste. It comes from a food that's not going to provide Glu Glucose confounds our bodies sugar handling process, whatever. Plus C, I just switched back to normal shit. Raw Sugar. Stevia, all oh often contains other ingredients. Oh, there's an issue of purity. Hmm. Hmm. We use processed Divia, not pure stevia leaves. Obviously you a pot of Stevia leaves growing in your garden. You can ignore this point, but there's a bunch of other shit. Xylella tall. That's another one, right? Yeah. Popular sweetener made with Stevia and Xylitol, although proponents bestow the title natural to the sweetener. I've never, I've never eaten trivia because I'm not a fan of this Uber processed ingredient. Oh, Trivia Trivia. Truvia is Xylitol and Stevia. Stevia has an aftertaste. Eh? Stevia, diabetes. Yeah. I, aspartame is not good for you too, but it's, you know, when I think about all this stuff,

Speaker 3:          01:37:56       including diet coke, it's all in moderation. Like, you know, you can have a real coke if you want to just don't drink them all day every day. You know, I'm a, I'm a big fan of cheat days, man. I'm a big fan of just eating really healthy. And then one day going off the mother fucking rails, you know, and then bring it all back. Just give yourself a little day. We don't give a fuck. It's hard for me to do that, man. Only good for a week. And then my cheat day turns into a cheat month. Okay, let me ask you this spiral. You say that, but you're so happy right now, right? You're so successful right now. You've got so much cool shit going on. Your on your favorite show mean like life couldn't be better if you knew that the only way to keep this running the only way was if you ate healthy by some strange metaphysical mirror, Cole fucking magic thing.

Speaker 3:          01:38:47       Whereas like if you ate healthy food, you're luck would continue to be fucking amazing. But if you got lazy, it has nothing to do with your parents or your talent or your mind. But if you've got lazy and deviated from the path, your luck would change. It would be eaten fucking lettuce, lettuce wraps and bra fruit. And you wouldn't fuck around at all. Sure. But I love Mexican food, man. I love salsa. You put down a basket of chips. Now bring a second. Like that's what I want. I'm, I've never been one in a sweets. It's always like the starchy carbohydrates stuff. But do you ever have a case? Oh, in Texas I've had it. I'm not the biggest fan. Texas, I think. I just haven't had great, yeah. Ships in case. Oh, in Texas is a, a totally different level. Before they've Mexican food even comes, you're full, you ordered chips in case out, you know, they go, gee, would you like some chips and case out like yes ma'am.

Speaker 3:          01:39:41       They bring over some fucking case out when you get to meet in some Jalapenos. Oh yeah. They were targeted case. So that has like a cow in it brightened up a cow. I got a, I got a moose roast cooking at home right now. Very excited. A press release. Where are you getting the Mousse shot? The shit out of that most. Oh really? So this is him right here. No Shit. Yeah, that's it. Yeah, that's it, man. That's pretty Rad. It's delicious. But I'm cooking it today. Uh, over 10 hours. There's Moose roast in one of those pressure cookers. Oh, it's so delicious, man. How many pounds of meat you get out of that 400 shit. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Crazy. Did you have to buy a new freezer or did you have it? Oh No, I bought a separate fee. I had one commercial freezer, but after I shot the Moose, I bought another one just to, just to have the room for it.

Speaker 3:          01:40:27       You should experiment with making jerky because dude, I'm making all kinds of things. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I've been making, I've been doing roasts. Roasts are the new thing or do it in the green mountain grill. I see room on the outside on a, um, like a, of a cast iron frying pan. And then, uh, I slowly cook it in the Green Mountain girl for like 40, 45 minutes. Cause you know, it's not, not that big. A roast is only for like four people. And then this one I'm doing in a pressure cooker, but I'm, I've got a bunch of recipes from Steve Rinella sometime do meatloaf. I'm going to make ground meatloaf with spinach and cheese inside of it and enjoying cooking. Man, cooking is fun and if you have the time and you know you're so inclined. It's a cool little art project. Like I don't, I don't never think of cooking is like art but when it comes out it's good. Like you get this little kind of rd satisfies, made something like I made this and now we're going to eat it. This is kind of cool.

Speaker 6:          01:41:19       There was this a video I recently saw showing you how to cook the best steak and you don't even need to use it grill. What you do is you take this big piece of meat, you put it in the oven and you slow cook it in the oven for like an hour or something and then you just put it on a really hot skillet for like two minutes just as just a sear the outside and it's like the perfect temperature. It's like red throughout the whole thing. Not like, you know, right. Because when you cook it on a grill, it's usually red in the middle and then it slowly goes out. You know where it's like less red, you know the closer it is. This is like right when he cut it in all the exact color throughout the whole thing. The way you do it just got an hour. I get

Speaker 3:          01:41:56       that way. I've seen that way too. I've seen also there's a lot going around with a boil it in water. When those plastic bags, they boil it at like not even boil it. It's like hot water, like 125 degree water, which is below boiling. But it's like they keep it in there for several hours and then you take it out, sear it. And a lot of times people, they cook the outside actually with a flame. They take a like a propane torch and they'll, they'll, you know, they'll char the outside to get like they're crispy outer edge. I've tried every single method to cook like a regular beef steak that my favorite by far is lumped charcoal on a regular grill. You get that smoky real would taste to the stake and you just gotta know how hot it is. It's like a trial and error thing.

Speaker 3:          01:42:41       You got to know how for me, I, I take like a two inch stake. You need three minutes on each side and then I put it on the upper level of the grill. I close the lid and I cook it for another five minutes. That's it. And that kind of gets the inside. Bam. I've been doing that for like, oh, that sounds so, it feels so good. So bad for people who don't eat meat. I know, you know, I understand. I get it. I get the morals and the ethics, but those cows are going to dine them and I want you to do, you're going to die. My cousins have cows and they just, they just, uh, send them out to get butchered. Only got like 1700 pounds of meat. Wow. My Buddy Doug, does it himself. Sanity does he, my friend Doug has a, he has grass fed cows and his farm in Wisconsin and fucking picks him out.

Speaker 3:          01:43:22       That's where I started getting bummed out about grass fed cows cause everybody has this idea, oh, CRAs had cows. It's so ethical. You know, my cows are only grass fed there. You go near these fucking cows and they panic and run. They know exactly what you're there for. Make no mistake about it. This isn't like hunting. This isn't like, you know, you see a deer. The deer might not have ever even seen a person before. Boom, the gun goes off, the deer's down. That's a, that's an ethical life. These fucking cows to live in this, it's

Speaker 4:          01:43:52       smell it, dude. They know. We went near them and they fucking ran like we were. Demons like were demons that have corralled them up for slaughter because that's what we are to them. You saw the cows being released from the milk barn for the first time there where they're all jumping around like dogs and having a like there was so happy that you just sat there and go, wow, they are so happy right now that there you could tell that there's just like crying with happiness. Yeah. Yeah. They were trapped in those stalls for their whole life and then they released him out in this field and it just dancing around. Wow. Having a good old time with grief. I think it's a fucking, it's a real shame that somehow or another factory farming has become a real accepted part of the way we get food in this country. But that said, I like mate. I mean it's so good. I just tried goat for the first time. I had to go before had goat tacos and Houston. Yeah. Tacos as well. We did. They do. It was an Arizona.

Speaker 4:          01:44:51       Yeah, but why are you saying Ooh to that? Like, you know, like 90% of the world eats goat. I don't like go, go taste good. Have you had it? No. I mean I just don't like goat's so I don't think I want to eat. It's all in your head, dude. I'm telling you, you wouldn't like a lot of things. You, you know, if you hang out with chickens, you realize they're assholes. You know, I told Ya chickens bite my daughter's face. I'm like, you fucking cunt. I'll kill you. Chicken dinosaurs. Man, they're dinosaurs. I mean it costs $3 in my chickens are sweet, you know, cause they get pet and they get picked up and they'll still bite your fucking face. They're stupid as shit. Their brains, your thumbnail. I mean, literally society, they don't know what's going on. They're not doing it on purpose.

Speaker 4:          01:45:32       They're just trying to survive. Do you have a problem with coyotes getting your chickens? I saw coyote get my chicken. Oh really? Yeah. Oh my God. I have to get, I've been slacking on this, but I have to get a, I have to hire someone who, they have this urban coyote capture thing because the thing about we have 20, well we used to have 24 chickens. My dog killed one and the coyote killed another one. Um, but I saw the coyote jump my fence with the fucking chicken in his mouth. So I realized, okay, now I see how the coyotes, I had a fountain that was near the fence and the coyote would jump to the top of the fountain and jump over the fence. I was like, Oh, you son of a bitch. So I took the fountain down and a reinforced the areas where the coyote was getting in, but they know there's food there and they know there's a lot of food there. There's 24 or 22 now, 22 chickens, so I have to hire somebody. They do. These are urban traps and they set them up all over at my, I don't even live in or I'm not an urban area, but they set them up around your house and they capture these coyotes and they fucking Bang, Bang, I'm going to kill him. Wow. My cousins live urban traps like a swap meet or something. Yeah, urban traps. It's a gold chain next to foot locker. It's a pair of Jordan is next to then

Speaker 6:          01:46:50       one of those little lasso hose or a noose ankle news. Kanye is an issue is announcing is no one, and I want to talk about it. You don't like, no, I'm a fucking grown man. I'm not. I'm not. You and Jamie

Speaker 3:          01:47:04       call each other on the phone and talk about shit that nobody else gives you the fucking phone mail stop. Just don't just don't Brown. We have fucking Joshua McDonald from the walking dead. You want to talk about Kanye West and you're 40 years old and want to talk about Kanye and I've been telling him that for years. He's a fucking grown man. He's a grown man but he's not like somehow or another when we stuck them out of Columbus and brought him to Los Angeles, we've stifled is growth. It actually went back. He went back, he was 30 then and he's 12

Speaker 6:          01:47:34       that's completely opposite of what I've been figuring out lately. Going through your own video out Joe, do you remember when, when, when, when I first moved here like, like I didn't really have any friends so like we would just like once in a while like hang out and stuff. There was like videos of me just sitting in my computer and like my first week here and I was like mentally challenged. Retard. I don't even know why you would talk to me back then. I mean that you do really well. You don't even do I, I, I've gotten back into it. Please go back and I need to go on the road with you. Sometimes they do some,

Speaker 3:          01:48:07       he's very talented. Like his video editing skills are amazing. That's what I initially hired him for cause he's really good. And then he became a podcast in which he's challenged at. He's challenged at communicating. He's challenged to thinking about things that challenge is often his strength but his video skills I think, no bullshit. No, and I'm not saying this just because you're here, you're one of the best video editors I've ever seen. Like your, your, your like your sense of like timing and like you're editing and the way you splice things together, you create something that doesn't exist like you, you're capable of like you put these weird touches on things and the weird sounds and music and Ed, you have a real feel for it man. Like you have a real town. Like if you really pursued that you, you could be rich. I mean you really could be. I mean you should. You should. You should be like a guy that people seek out to make their music videos and shit like yeah. Weird sense of how to put things together. So real talent man. Who edited your last special? I did. Could have been common sense.

Speaker 6:          01:49:16       Brian. I don't see us having to do with himself. How much editing. It's just like that's a camera cuts. That's what I'm talking about. Like he did some stuff like look at the Austin via is my favorite one. Great one little Austin.

Speaker 3:          01:49:31       Yeah, with the dude that had the there was born with, no,

Speaker 6:          01:49:34       no, no, no. I'm talking about the Joey Diaz. It was me little Esther. You share ideas and just because the editing, the audio editing because I remixed music to go with everything and yeah, it was funny that you're

Speaker 3:          01:49:48       really fucking talented with that. I really think it's your calling in life. You know? It's like as Joey Diaz is meant to be a standup comic, you're meant to be a video. Have more fun doing standup comedy to know because it's immediate. It's immediate gratification. But the you do shit that I can't do. I don't have that mind. My mind does not work that way.

Speaker 6:          01:50:06       I'm trying to get back into it. And then this new computer, it's finally getting to the point where it's so much. The rendering thing was the thing that I hate it and I'm the reason that made me stop. And we're just sitting there waiting for hours. Hours.

Speaker 3:          01:50:20       What about those new Max, those tubes, those super masc the tower.

Speaker 6:          01:50:24       Well, it's funny because you'd think that would be the best computer cause I almost, cause I mean I just bought a new computer and researching those, uh, you've, you realize that they're using a different processor that isn't really that good for video editing as compared to the I seven processor that the imax use. So if you look at rendering times on one of those machines versus a Imac and the imac even comes across being faster and a lot of the tests, because those are used Xeon processors, which aren't really, I don't know why they use the,

Speaker 3:          01:50:56       so is it because the software is optimized for that

Speaker 6:          01:51:00       processor? I think so. Yeah. This is really boring. No one

Speaker 10:         01:51:06       [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          01:51:08       well, he would call me like, you know, after he'd edited for like 12 hours ago, I'm calling fucking crazy. Like I don't think I could do the same. We're all, I'm almost done, but I'm going fucking crazy. Like, but the process, the result was amazing. I just think you've got a very unique talents.

Speaker 6:          01:51:22       That was awesome. Back in the days when, when we are using mini DV tapes. Oh yeah. So in order to edit I had to transfer every single tape onto my computer, then look at it and then go through the 50 hours now. I mean you just pull a card out. Yes.

Speaker 3:          01:51:36       Slipped it in. What you should do while you're single, you should, you should do some sort of a, a Brian reviews, massage

Speaker 6:          01:51:45       powers. I'm scared of that place. Let's place this now. Yeah. Cause my favorite place got busted and now that they're off fake cops that work there and yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:51:52       Do you go to jail? Do you go to jail for going? You just got to play dumb. Oh yeah. You go to jail. No, you just got to play dumb. He's going to go, how many here to get my feet rubbed and rubbed my feet? Yeah. You know, I'm going to get a foot massage. True. You know? Do you want anything else? Hey, whatever you want to do. I'm just here. I'm just going to close my eyes. You do what you want to do and if you want a hundred bucks, you know, you just do what you want to do. And I just laid back. Good. I tip good. Yeah, I mean, I'm a good tip. I just liked massages. I'm just going to sit here and you know what I mean?

Speaker 6:          01:52:20       Going there because you got a little something extra or was it they got busted after the fact and you're like, wait, I didn't even know. He doesn't know. I don't know about rub maps and there, this is my favorite website that I read every single day. Oh, you do know it?

Speaker 10:         01:52:37       He's been all Hollywood on us. Josh,

Speaker 3:          01:52:40       Darren, you've come a long way since Phoenix.

Speaker 6:          01:52:43       No, I mean it's, it's, it's, it's, but it's, it's, it is something that also you have to think about, like the sex, the sex slave industry. Dang. You will run into places where you're just like, this person does not want to be here. Like right now where I live, this is one of the craziest things I found. There's this apartment or this bold house next to me and they have like a garage, a separate garage out back and just this little small garage. And I saw somebody come out of it the other day and I'm like, what the fuck? Why is there some Asian girl in there? And then like a couple of days later somebody opened up the door and there's like four people living in this little garage about the size of my car. Like, I mean it's just, it's ridiculous and they're just living there and that's the kind of shit that freaks me out. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:53:27       Okay. But is that just people that like, you know, some people come here from another country and they're poor and they have a relative, here are the relative says, look, you could sleep in my garage until you get on your feet. We'll set up some beds. It's warm. We're in Burbank. You don't have to worry about it doesn't get cold at night.

Speaker 6:          01:53:41       Or are they sex slaves? I don't know. Cause they, they looked, they looked like they were

Speaker 3:          01:53:46       miserable. That's the reality of prostitution being illegal. Yeah. That's a big part of the problem. If, if prostitution was completely legal and like a massage, I mean, which it should be. I mean, I don't want to give people massages. Okay. I also don't want to give him anybody any blow jobs. But there's some people that don't care. They don't, they like giving massages. They don't mind giving blow jobs for 300 bucks instead of working at Denny's for three days for 300 bucks, you know, and they wouldn't even get 300 bucks to work there for three days. They could blow you for five minutes and make 300 bucks. Some people would do that and that's their prerogative as adult human beings are issue is legality and these weird ethics that we attach to sexuality over everything else we do. Like everything else you do, where people serve you well, people will serve you, drinks there, serve you food.

Speaker 3:          01:54:37       They don't fucking want to. Nobody wants to bring you your meat. Nobody wants us. Mr Mcdermott, would you like some cracked pepper on that salad? He doesn't want to put fucking pepper on your salad, right? That guys only doing it because he wants your money. I mean, he's whoring himself out and I mean this in the nicest way possible. He's not really, but I mean, he's doing it for money. You know, it's a job. It's a great job. It's nothing wrong with being a waiter. Don't, don't get me wrong, but it's also nothing wrong with having sex. I mean, we have this crazy idea in our head that sex is evil and nasty and Ooh, you're paying for sex. You get money for sex, you fucking whore. Somebody pays you and then they touch you. You fucking bitch. You know, like it's craziness. Where we have these weird attachments that are completely socially constructed.

Speaker 3:          01:55:21       We've decided that these things are pad. The real issue is that stuff, sex, slavery, that you're not talking about a woman who's like just a grown woman, a mature woman who decides on her own, you know, it's just sex. Who gives a shit. It's a, it's a fine way to pay my bills. I can go travel and I'll do whatever the fuck I want with my life and I'll be independent. It's not that those are the, the victims. The real issue is that when you have things illegal, then everything has to be CD and hidden and uh, you know, in, in the darkness and underground and then you get things like sex slavery and it's very analogous to the drug war. One of the real reasons why the drug war exists is because drugs are illegal. The re one of the real reasons why there's so much crime and Mexico that's related to the drug trade is directly because drugs aren't legal.

Speaker 3:          01:56:15       If drugs were legal, you wouldn't have criminals that are selling drugs and have criminals weren't selling drugs. You'd be able to buy drugs the same way you go to fucking cvs and buy liquor. There's no fucking gang wars over whiskey. It's not happening, right? Whiskeys sold and it's taxed and everybody's hands, you'll be fine. Other than the fact that people drink it and do stupid shit weather on it, there's no violence and no murder and no crime attached to the production of fine whiskey. It's just, and that's how it should be with sex and that's how it should be with everything. We are adult human beings. If you want to pay someone to rub your feet, you should be able to do it. Could you imagine if like back massages were somehow or another deemed morally outrageous and you couldn't go and get a massage? Like you know those places at the airport where you sit down, you put your face in that chair and they come over and rub your back. What did they suck your Dick? I've tried.

Speaker 10:         01:57:10       Okay,

Speaker 3:          01:57:13       I'll put a blanket over us. I mean if you went to a place like that and they gave you a hand jobs, he'll be the most glorious thing ever. If you went to that place and there was a beautiful Russian lady and she took you into this quiet room and she just copped your balls with one hand and jerked you off with the other. Oh well you had an IPAD, you're watching porn. Oh be greatest thing ever.

Speaker 6:          01:57:34       I want to know what consent, like what's the difference between like if you go on back page and you see they have escorts than they have legit massages where they bring a table over to your house and they massage you. Then they have the same category. Yeah. Then they have body sliders where it's like they bring like a big inflatable raft that you have like in a swimming pool and then you get naked and then they put oil over unit and they just slide their naked body on you and that you're not fucking, but he's like, it's that illegal or like what makes it, you have to have insertion. I mean, it just doesn't seem like escorting can be, you can be caught for cause like if you really, I don't know, it just seems like, what's the law without much first the slider though, 150 bucks usually for half hour.

Speaker 3:          01:58:20       Did, did they define what a body slide or is?

Speaker 6:          01:58:23       Uh, there's videos of it. You can, there's actually videos on youtube. Uh, it's a, it's, it's, I mean it sounds great, but you sound like that.

Speaker 3:          01:58:31       That's one of those things where it's like, it's again, it's like a cultural thing. Like what, what does a body slider, you know, like you have to define it because like, you know, what's the sandwich? Everybody knows the sandwiches, some shit in between two slices

Speaker 4:          01:58:42       of bread. If you order a sandwich somewhere, brings you a pizza, you're like, what the fuck is, this is what we call a sandwich. You know what, what do you call body slider in, in northern California is the same as a body slider in Chicago with the fucking body slider man and sort of a body sound sneaky shit.

Speaker 6:          01:58:58       Yeah. Body sites. Uh, and, and, and you just sit there with like a boner out and they just pretty much rubbed their whole body on your, your boner body boobs. Like it's just no insertion, but pretty much everything else. Is that illegal?

Speaker 4:          01:59:11       Um, I say no if no insertion. I don't think it's illegal. So it's just an assertion. But I think if you come, it's probably illegal. Right? That's where all the fucking, that's where the Hullabaloo is about. Orgasming nobody, it's a bunch of haters. They don't want you to come.

Speaker 6:          01:59:28       Is there like a five second rule? Like if you company put it in your mouth real quick and it doesn't count because it's going back into your body, that's disgusting. Why is it disgusting? It came out of your body two seconds, you know,

Speaker 4:          01:59:40       shut the fuck up. Seriously. Just think before you say something like that. Imagine that undercover cop who got assigned a body slamming. How about the undercover cop? The watches him eat his own company. Second rule. I mean, I always find it weird though. Like if you have it

Speaker 6:          01:59:58       goober and your mouth and you could feel it's one of those thick ones and then you spit it on a piece of paper. The idea of you'd now linking that back up is the most grossest thing in the rural, but just a second ago you were in your mouth just tasting it and true swishing it around because

Speaker 4:          02:00:11       you don't think about it. It's out of sight, out of mind. You don't have to look at it. It's when you look at it, you know, kind of gross. It's like if you had to take a shit, you know that's one thing you're like, oh I can't wait to take a shit. And he'd get on that toilet. Ah, it comes up. But if you had a stuffed that shit back in your asshole, just if he had to reach in there with rubber gloves on and just pack your own ass, repack it. That might be one of the worst things you could ever do. Like taking a shit. It's amazing when you hold it in for just a little bit, not a long time. He'll look shit extra 20 minutes and then you get on that toilet just ah, you feel those logs just fucking barrel and down the river.

Speaker 4:          02:00:51       Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. I went to, I took a dump at the mall the other day. I've been trying to eat healthier, eating more Greens and stuff. So it came out like very earthy. Right. It wasn't anything horrible. It just smelled and I flushed and then the guy came in to clean the restroom and started choking and I felt so good and he just kind of get, hear him like trying to clean up and then he just go at the end, he just goes, he was in there about two minutes. He goes, it smells like fucking shit.

Speaker 4:          02:01:26       Like ah yeah. That was like a highlight of my life. Like you scored on him. He scored on him. He fucking shit in a bathroom. That guy's got to go in there right after you and I had flood. So it wasn't like it was still sitting there stewing I, it was post flush. What? There's nothing worse than when you have to shit really bad. And the only option is a Porta potty and you're at a concert and there's 20 people behind you and there's a long ass line and you go in there and you plop down and you're shitting on other people's shit that is on top of other people's Shit, which is on other people's Shit, which is all in smurf juice and you just drop in logs on top of preexisting logs and just gagging. Meanwhile, the band's playing your favorite song. Freebird no, fuck.

Speaker 4:          02:02:18       I was here. Did you? I saw this online. They had a thing about the Porta potties, like the whole point of him is you're supposed to close the lid and then that will take the scent out up through this funnel, like this tube and release the sent up there, but the reason port-a-potties smells so bad it's because everyone just leaves the lit up. No one wants to touch it. Oh God. Yeah. The deal is this is all bullshit. It's stinks. It's a fucking confined space. You're shitting in a phone booth. It's not going anywhere. That's smells everywhere. As a society we could try it. If it's still going to snake, we can at least give it a shot on the walking dead. Do you guys shit out in the woods? Diedrich dropped blogs. We've got trailers out there that have like their air condition. They're down to like 50 degrees so it's like 90 degrees outside and then, I mean I'm finding excuses to take it dump.

Speaker 4:          02:03:05       Do you sometimes have like long downtime in between scenes? You could take a nice fat nap. Yeah, I still love those if you can. I mean, well because a lot of times because we shoot on location, so everything, it takes a while to get back to your trailer where like I have a couch or something I could sleep on and so it's rare that a, they would make you sit for that long. How far away are you from like the set? Like if your trailer is one place, how far away is the set where you're feeling? It's usually always less than 10 minutes. You were telling us before that you get there at five o'clock in the morning, but when are you done? You didn't just say when you were, um, well we'll use up all the sunshine. So like the sunsets about 9:00 PM and Georgia 9:00 PM in the summer.

Speaker 4:          02:03:46       Wow. So you're working alone? Yeah, the fucking date. So they try and schedule it because I think there's like a, with the actors union, you have like a turnaround, like you 12 hours, 12 hours, and if they make you come back, you know, shorter than the 12 hour turnaround, they have to pay you. And um, so I, I dunno. Yeah, I'd actually, it's because I'm a, I'm considered a local actor, be a local hire because I live in Atlanta. Then they, there's like some rules around that where they don't have to pay me all the time. Did you get apartment in Atlanta or did you rent a house or apartment and um, when you, when you come back to La, did you keep an apartment in la or do you just stay here for a little bit? I kept one here and then I, and I, I'm going to have that as long as the on the show cause I don't know when I'll get killed off and I'm

Speaker 1:          02:04:37       not going to want to go find a new place. I like where I live now. Do you ever go to the producer and go, listen, I'm about to resign my lease. Is there anything I shouldn't question? Currently that happened with one of the actors who are like at the start of the season, cause they're secretive to us of course, you know, but they were like, hey, so I have a feeling I'm being set up to be killed. Should I, you know, I don't want to sign the lease. And I'm like, no, no, no, no, you're fine. And they went and signed the lease and then they get killed. Wow. Dick, did they go to them and to go, Hey, what the fuck? Yeah, they were pretty upset. But then there was another guy who, who literally got it out of Lawrence Gilliard who plays Bob. The guy got his leg chopped off and eaten by the cannibals.

Speaker 1:          02:05:20       Um, he didn't want to sign a lease because he had a feeling he was about to go. And so he actually got the producers a talent, like he like sat in the meeting with them until he wouldn't leave until they told him like, yeah, you're going to die in episode three or whatever it was because he was about to sign a lease. That's it. Yeah. He's just like, look, this is going to cost me 10,000 bucks or 12 bucks. So he just didn't want it, you know. I mean obviously you can break a lease and you know, but you're still paying for that. But um, he got it out of them and then of course, like, you know, they didn't tell us that he was dying and I'm sitting there like texting. I'm like, hey man, where are you live in this season? This and he's like radio silent.

Speaker 1:          02:05:55       And then I figured out that they were going to kill him cause I'm like, why would he be avoiding me right now? Uh, it's not telling me where he's living. It was just weird. You know, whatever, when you shot, when you had that scene, we shut that one scene. We shot up the truck and like shut the gas tank and all that stuff. Like w w w how much of that was real? Like did you, you were shooting a gun, was it blanks where you actually shooting at that car? Cause it seemed like you were actually hitting that car? Yeah, it was half and half. So they did. Um, so they give you blanks, but then they tell you once you're out, you know, just keep firing or mimicking, like you're, you're firing the weapon and then, um, you know, cause they'll, they'll cut it around and everything.

Speaker 1:          02:06:34       I think there's only like 20 rounds in that clip, you know? And I think if you really look at it, I was probably fired like over a hundred shots. I'm fucking problem with revolvers, but it's easy if fees, it costs like five bucks to put in a muzzle flash and like post, you know, so they're like, you know, so just keep jerking the gun, like you're firing away. And so I did that. And, um, but then what they do is they had these guys, because we were right next to a corn field and they had our special effects guys like perched on some, uh, ladders with these like a paintball guns with these exploding, um, I don't know the pellets that of spark off. So like when I go and I shoot up the truck, they're fine. Actually the ones firing the truck and BBB, BBB and it just hits on the truck. So that was really cool cause they used to have to like run this line of, um, of charges or whatever and have those explode at one time. Well when you, when you kill a Zombie, like what is actually happening? Like, cause some of it is obviously so CGI, right? Like the blood looks fake. It looks, you know, some of it's not too realistic. So they could show it almost like the craziness of the blood is almost like, you know,

Speaker 3:          02:07:42       varies because the one scene in terminus when they beat the people over the head and then cut their throat, that looked real as fuck.

Speaker 1:          02:07:49       Well, it's super disturbing with that. They had, um, like these tubes that were just tied around their neck and even everyone on set was going like, oh, this looks totally fake. And they're like, no, no, no, we'll color that out later. And the tubes were actually like gushing out the blood and so when they cut, you know, so they, they do the motion to cut and I think they either had like a rubber knife or a lot of times they have a knife that's just the handle with something like green tape on the end and it's so it's not a full NY for machete sort of thing. And then they paint that in later. The knife is CGI. Yeah. So that like if I got this water bottle and there's no blade on the end of it and I just use that and then they can just paint that in and make it look like a knife as a cut my throat. So cool. And then they just painted out the, uh, the tube so that all that was left was just blood gushing out into the trough. A pretty fucking awesome. It looks so real. It was awful. That was brutal, man.

Speaker 3:          02:08:40       Well, that whole scene was like, it was so, it was hard to see how these people could become those people. It was so hard, especially when they would show the background on them, like how they, where they were when the, the, the whole outbreak first happened. Like they were normal and then they became cannibals. Then they're just treating their marking down on clipboards where they're beating people over the head with all that conical. Yeah. It was really weird. It was almost too over the top because it was like, God, I can't see anybody that I know. Getting to that point where they clubbed someone and turn them into us.

Speaker 1:          02:09:14       DESC yeah. You know, but, but at this point you've got to survive. You've got to eat terrifying. No, but all that CGI stuff, Michelle and the, the girl with the sword, like her sword is fake usually. And that's all painted in after the fact. What is her sword look like when she swinging it around? It's just the handle. That's it. Just the handle. Yeah. Just to handle. They have no sorts so they have a real sword but they rarely ever had it out and use it. You know like they might use it if she's just like presenting it to someone or whatever, but then they have like a rubber sword that looks exactly like it or plastic so that you know for safety reasons, but then they just have a lot of them that are either like a half nub or just know sort at all. Just the handle. She has the best weapon. Sure.

Speaker 3:          02:09:59       That was one thing that I learned. If the zombies are coming and then not those 28 days later zombies, they're fucking sprint at you. If those slow as his armies, you want to have a Samurai sword. Yeah. I would have a great old fucking time. That's one of the things that I didn't understand about the prison when everybody was like, you know the, all these zombies are pushing up against that wall. I'm like, there's not that many gimme a sword. Let me, let me go out there and

Speaker 1:          02:10:21       fuck them are popping them. Yeah. She just start fucking hacking heads. Kind of the sad thing is that we'll never really get to experience that. Oh, you say that there were no, with all these liberals and they're denying

Speaker 4:          02:10:34       of the Lord the Demon, this may rise all this gay marriage. It's transgender mayors and all kinds of shit going on the world. I would, uh, take that Samurai sword over basically any weapon because it's not too heavy. Like if you had like Conan sword, like a big broad sword, that'd be tough. That's heavy. You'd have to be real tough. Some, you know, built like the Rock, like an aluminum bat. Yeah. But they don't always die. You know, I, that's another confusing thing about the zombies. You just got to poke him in the eye and they're dead. Like it seems like you just get into their head, their brain, and it's super easy to stab someone in the temple apparently. And the knife just goes right in there. Like, get butter is that Zombie blood that makes you a Zombie or any secretions fucking like and be in the butt.

Speaker 4:          02:11:22       And when would you get become a Zombie if you fucked us on me in the, but I don't think so, but you're already infected. So who cares. Yeah. You already infected. Which is weird because like when the guy got bit last night and that episode he got bit, but if he just caught arises that wound, does he become a Zombie? Um, ah. If I put them up, think, well fuck them. I'm not the expert on this thing through. I don't think they thought they should do. Yeah. Actually the whole show sucks. I think if the, if the effect, you know, cause you're already infected or you're already, you already have what's in, you know, that's inside of you. If you die, you're going to turn. But if you get bit and that infection is going to come in and trigger whatever's inside of you. So if you cut off your arm like they did and cauterize it, then you're probably okay.

Speaker 4:          02:12:06       Because they did that with Hershel and his leg. Yeah. You know? Yeah. That was weird. You know, that was like, okay you just guys just fuck with the rules because it used to be something bites you and then it gets into your bloodstream and like, you know, well they've been fucking with the rule since the beginning even in the pilot. Um, cause zombies aren't supposed to have any sort of like recollection of them being normal humans. And the, there was like a little girl at that gas station who walks by and just bends down and picks up her little teddy bear that was hers and Tucks it up and walks away. But her face is all mangled. She sewed Zombie at that point cause Frank Darabont was like, fuck the rules. I'm going to do my own thing. I like that, you know, he's going to medieval times.

Speaker 4:          02:12:48       It gets some chain mail. Right. When didn't you just wear like a night? Yeah, you would just dress up, but yeah man. Yeah. Do that riot police like they have that uh, the Kevlar you can't bite to that shit would break. Yeah. You can't even fucking stab some. There's a guy who made the a, the a shark bite suit. Did you see this? Yeah. Yeah. And I, so I did some a shark after dark during shark week. Shark after dark. Yeah. Have you heard of this show? It's what, you know Josh Wolfe, right? The comic? Yeah. Yeah. So he hosts it and they just talk all about sharks and all this stuff. And um, this guy comes on, he had this like chain mail suit that is supposedly supposedly a bite proof and um, they were stabbing.

Speaker 1:          02:13:32       Josh was wearing it, they were stabbing him with the knife and the knife was bending and they were trying to stab him in the chest. But the guy was showing us how, you know, you can just take a knife and he had the glove on and he was slicing like the webbing in between his fingers and everyone's like, oh my God, or whatever. And then they gave me an ice pick and he put his hand out and kind of like that movie alien, I had to go in between his fingers and do that. And they told me beforehand, they go, go ahead and like, you know, pop them in the hand a few times because he's not going to, it's not going to hurt him or anything. And so I did that and then I just started just jamming the ice, pick into his hand and apparently I broke his hand.

Speaker 1:          02:14:10       Oh my God. Yeah, broke his hip, broke his hand. Josh told me that Jammin it. Oh Dude, it was, I was pounding, but I'm like, the producers told me that it was okay, but he's like, no. He was like, oh, okay. And uh, some people that were with me were like, oh dude, I think you heard him. I'm like, no, he's playing it up. They said he couldn't get hurt. Then Josh tells me like a month later, it's like, yeah, you broke that dude's hand. Wow. I felt good. I am stronger than a shark. That's the one thing

Speaker 3:          02:14:41       that would freak you out. Like a shark got a hold of your arm. It's a snap your fucking arm. Like a twig swimming muscle. Like I've seen a lot of guys get their arms broken in fights where they get kicked and they're blocking the kick in. The Shin hits there. I saw one just last night, I was watching access TV legacy kickbox and this guy got kicked, blocked it and his arm just went limp in the middle. Just start dangling luck. Oh, it was crazy. He and he's still fighting. He's trying to throw a knee and he sees his arm like flopping around to hear about Hector Lombard. Yes. Another one. Tests positives. UFC and MMA in general is a steroid epidemic. Started this like really stringent testing and everybody's getting popped and just getting popped left and right. It's one of the things that fighters had been saying for a long time that everyone's on steroids, you know, a huge percentage.

Speaker 3:          02:15:29       Give him number 50 60 whatever the fuck it is that are on steroids. Look, apparently your, your body just can't. The idea of a normal training, normal training camp, which is fighters will work out sometimes three times a day. They'll do, maybe they'll run and do like sprints in the morning. Then they'll do some kind of strength and conditioning in the afternoon and then they'll do wrestling or Jujitsu at night and they'll vary. They'll the next day they'll do kickboxing in the morning and running in the afternoon and weightlifting at night and they mix it up. But you're talking about working out three times in a day because you have all these different skills that you have to work on. You have to work on your wrestling, you have to work on kickboxing, Jujitsu, and there's just not enough time in the day and there's not enough time for your body to heal. And that's where it comes in. Doctor Field. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:16:22       It comes to the line, ie bay. What do you think though, with like, you know, Silva was injured in there saying that maybe

Speaker 6:          02:16:30       the doctor that he was working with had that has had a past of, you know, over prescribing, you know, uh, amounts of steroids or illegal,

Speaker 3:          02:16:39       you're saying maybe, or he had,

Speaker 6:          02:16:40       no, he has, I saw something the other day where, uh, a, uh, what's his doctor's name and he's like a Brazilian, um, uh, doctor that, whatever his name is. But, uh, I guess in the past, uh, this other fighter was like, yeah, he, uh, I was, it was approved to use this kind of steroid or something like that for an injury. And he gave me too much. And then I, uh, you know, which caused me to be like seven months of being penalized, you know, out of the UFC, and I forget this fighter's name, but he says that's what's happening is Silva Silva, he's like, been fighting some 17. He's never touched steroids. You know, he's been working this injury and it might just be that, right?

Speaker 3:          02:17:20       It could be. There's a lot of, it could be that, but uh, another issue was there was a, um, a TV show they did a long time ago back from Anderson's house. And, uh, one of the things that they saw in the background was pen tips for a Norditrope and it was on the shelf. A very specific box that has pen tips nor to trope in is a type of human growth hormone pen. And you take this human growth hormone injected in someone's body. Um, and so that might not have been his, so who knows, UFC fighter claim. Some doctor who screwed up his TRT has now victimized Anderson Silva. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Listen, you can't listen to these guys though, because there's a lot. Yeah. See Big Foot, you know, he, he's blaming a doctor for him taking an abnormally high dose of testosterone. Maybe true may not be true, but it's within his best interest to say that the doctors at fault, and it's not his fault.

Speaker 3:          02:18:17       The doctor said he was going to sue him because the doctors like, you know, you're, you're lying. I didn't do anything unethical or outrageous to you and everything you wanted me to do, I did for you. Who the fuck knows who's telling the truth? It's a, it's totally a, he said she same thing, it turns into a game, but Anderson was coming back from a broken leg and um, he tested positive for the way I understand it. Metabolites, which means it was, it was leaving his system is a very trace amount. If that is the case, it could very well be that he got on some steroids so that he could heal up quicker. Because what steroids do is they allow you to recover quicker. So if he's 39 years old and he broke his fucking leg, you're talking about a long ass period of recovery or you take steroids and you recover in nine months instead of 15 months or you know, fill in the blank with whatever, the real numbers.

Speaker 3:          02:19:07       So that could be what was going on. But the reality is it's illegal. You can't do it if it takes you 15 months, you use the excuse cannot be, oh, I'm going to give you some illegal drugs. So that you heal quicker. Um, this is the only reason why you take these drugs. Don't worry about it. You'll be fine. No, you're never allowed to take steroids because one of the things that happens when he takes is it, it creates permanent changes in your muscles depending upon the steroid, permanent changes, permanent like your, your, your muscle density and your tenant strength and, and various attributes of your muscles. It's been proven that some of the benefits of steroids continue permanently. So it's not just when you're on them, you're a fucking the hulk because a lot of these guys, especially back in the day when they were fighting and pride like they, I had ants in any way who was on the podcast, who was a fighter from pride.

Speaker 3:          02:19:58       It was totally clean, who said it was on his fucking contract that they said on the contract, we will not test you for steroids. They set on the contract encouraged guys to take steroids. So a lot of guys took it, but you get stronger than you're supposed to be. You're not really a person anymore. It's like if you're a person, okay, like let's imagine, you know, they're doing all these weird things now with genetics where they're, they're taking like a fucking a mouse and a growing a human ear on its back and then, you know, taking that human man, inserting it in a person, what do all these weird shit with people? If they take Josh McDermitt and they add one 10th of 1% rhino genes and all of a sudden you're fucking running through brick walls and ra, are you even a person anymore? If you get off that drug, but you retain a fraction of that ability, whatever the fraction is you, you're, it's, it's arguable that a person who takes steroids, especially prolonged steroid use over a long career of fighting, you know, you know, you've fought for 15 years, been taking steroids for 15 years.

Speaker 3:          02:21:01       You might, you're not really technically the same as you would ever be without those steroids. Like you're, you're another category. You're a, Coca Cola has a certain amount of ingredients. Okay, this is a bad analogy, I know. But if you look at the ingredients of Coca Cola and you add Tequila, that is not fucking cocacola anymore. Now you have a new thing and shit sandwich should be able to, should you be able to serve that, that Coca Cola Tequila out of a coke machine? No, he should not because people are looking for coke now. Human beings very widely biologically, so it's not the best analogy, but the reality is, especially as this is this whole steroid out could epidemic is one thing we have to recognize. The use of steroids is less than a hundred years old, less than a hundred years old and steroids in athletics. I mean I don't know what the fuck they taking in the 1940s if they had anything to complain, but they did.

Speaker 3:          02:21:54       They did take, came back then. I mean they did. They most certainly did. Amphetamines if always been an issue with baseball, amphetamines and stimulants and things that increase your ability to concentrate and your, you know, your ability to stay awake. He's always been substances that people have taken. But the actual use of antibiotics, steroids in human beings is relatively recent in human history. And I think that as time goes on, they're going to create more and more powerful and crazier shit. And it's going to get to the point where you're going to test negative because you're not on it anymore. But your body will forever be changed. Like you'll girls would be in denial about having a fake button. I'm like, God, it's totally my butt. Well cause they can take the fat, suck it out of your size, pack it in your ass and it stays in your ass. Now you know they, it stays forever. When you gain weight, you're asking its weight. When you lose weight, your ass loses weight, but your ass will always have more fat than it ever did before because you've literally pack fat in there and people can lie about it. And I got that scar. I fell on a swinging when I was little.

Speaker 3:          02:22:57       You're going to have men that are like that. You're going to take a guy and you're going to give him a shot. And he's going to turn into the fucking hulk, and then that's shot's going to wear off in, his body's going to stay the same and it's going to happen. It's going to happen. There's, they're on their way there. There's all sorts of like this thing that Hector lumbar got popped for today. I've never even heard of this shit before. They're calling a DMT, which is obviously not dimethyltryptamine, but it's, I'm going to try this. What if it was yes, so methyl testosterone, deso desks, wo de soc psy, d e s o, x, y to socksy methyl testosterone, men destock, socksy, detoxy, methy testosterone, I dunno. Whatever the fuck that is. I never heard of it before. And so it's apparently a designer, anabolic steroids.

Speaker 3:          02:23:45       So what I think that means is that these one of these steroids has been concocted to get around the rules. Like, um, you know, they had that shit. The clear that Barry Bonds was on the ball co scandal that was all about, they devised a steroid that was very similar in efficacy in the way it worked, but not the same exact molecular structure as like antibiotics, doors that are common. So they were able to put it on these guys. Like it was like a lotion. You would rub it on, your body would fucking get crazy and they would pass these tests. You know this, the tests are getting way, way more sophisticated. So who knows? Lombard must've. I mean it must've thought that he couldn't get in trouble for this shit. I Dunno, I don't understand it. Have you ever tried a steroids, Josh? No. I mean I've had like steroid shots, cortisone shots, stuff like that.

Speaker 3:          02:24:37       But no dude, they used to have the shit you could buy. The strongest shit that I ever took. You could buy, you could buy it in. Um, you could buy it in like GNC and it was called Mag 10. It was ridiculous. You take like 10 pills a day and you would gain like I gained like 10 pounds of muscle in like six weeks of doing it too and this, and this is how I know that it was a total steroid because first of all, now it's illegal. You can't sell anymore. But when I got off it and my Dick took a vacation, it's like, see a dude, like my testosterone just shut down. It just stopped working and I was like, whoa, this is crazy. Like I couldn't get it up like my dick was broken for like two weeks up brief man. But it's some shit that you could just buy.

Speaker 3:          02:25:29       They used to be all these loopholes. You can buy stuff at Gnc, you could just buy these things tribulus still no, that's legal. See, those are very mild tribulus and it's still fucked with me. I remember taking that and then after a couple of weeks getting kind of like angry or that doesn't really make sense. No, no. That's why were you taking it? Very mild. I hang out with Joe Rogan. Man Tribulus is just a route and it does, it very mildly enhances your body's production of testosterone. There's another one called tongue got Ali that has a similar effect. That's also like a, a plant based substance that mildly enhances your body's ability to, but it doesn't fuck with the production of it. The thing about steroids is what happens is like you, you, you take something and it just jacks your body's levels of testosterone so then your body's natural production of testosterone shuts down.

Speaker 3:          02:26:27       And that's why like when I took that in mag 10 stuff, like after I got off of it, my body was like, yeah dude, I'm not really feeling like fuck him. We're just gonna. We'll just take a little break here. I mean it took two weeks to get your wiener back, but d two weeks it was really, you know how long ago you were maybe, I mean did you feel any other side effects after going off of it or it felt like how long did it take physically weaker and, and then I lost some weight, like a loss, like muscle mass. Like you gained a certain amount of muscle, but there was like a lot of these things that you could just buy these shoes, buy them at stores cause they were like these loopholes. Like, like you know how bath salts exists. Do you know, do you know the whole story behind it?

Speaker 3:          02:27:05       It exists for folks who don't know because you would take something like crystal Meth, which is an absolutely illegal drug. But if you change just one compound, one molecule of that compound, just alter it slightly and then sell it. No one can say it's illegal because it's not illegal. It's not the same thing anymore. If meth is illegal and then you just tweak it a little bit. Like dimethyltryptamine was turned the, this is the psychedelic drug was made illegal in 1970 by the sweeping psychedelic act of 1970 but they missed five methoxy field trip to me, which is actually stronger. There's an end dimethyltryptamine and then five methoxy dimethyltryptamine five methoxy dive the trip to me and it's like d dimethyltryptamine like an oxygen molecule attached to or something like that. So it's just slightly different but legal. But if you smoked it, you would go to the center of the fucking universe and converge with God in the most epic journey of your life.

Speaker 3:          02:28:03       I mean it's like way stronger than mushrooms. Yeah. I mean you took a good breakthrough dose of five Meo DMT, he'll change you for the rest of your fucking life. And that was legal. And it was only legal because it wasn't technically dimethyltryptamine, which was illegal. So that's what his bath salts thing is. They alter the compound slightly and then they sell it, not for human consumption. They say bath salts and then they sell it at grocery stores or I mean, you know, seven 11 so wherever they want to send like gas stations mostly I think. And they can get away with doing that because it's not technically the same drug and they just keep altering it, keep tweaking it a little bit here and tweaking it a little bit there with varying results too, which is really weird. Like the difference between DMT and five Meo DMT is profound in the effects.

Speaker 3:          02:28:54       Five meo is stronger, but there's no visual experience. The visual is just pure white and it's like white molecules like fractal white around you. It doesn't have the visual effect of an end. Dimethyltryptamine and dimethyltryptamine it's just what you know. The, the with Iowasca is based on, and it's all, it's very hallucinogenic. Like the things you see, the visuals are spectacular, the colors are amazing. All those things are missing from five meo which is like kissing cousins to the same drug. So it's, so that's, I think one of the things that's wrong with bass salts is like some of 'em, you know, you tweak it one way or another and especially on different individuals have different, they have via biodiversity and the way they respond to different drugs. You have varying effects. Like that fucking dude, wait, that dude's face off grief. Just like zombies. We bring it back. This zone.

Speaker 4:          02:29:49       Bees, how do you remember all that Shit, man. Drugs. Drugs helped me remember it. I take Alpha brain. That helps you remember you had to have been really good in school. I was terrible in school. That makes no sense because you, you, you capture so much information. You're an encyclopedia of knowledge. Like, I mean I was talking to someone the other day, I don't remember who, but I was just like, yeah, he like, he'll, he'll start saying something and just like 10 minutes later you're just like, I don't, I don't even remember what you said. There was so much information you just threw at me and it's not like you're like, because for me, I'm always like, yeah. So then there's this one drug and it's like five and it's not something, but anyway, no, you like, I dunno when you learned about all this, but I guarantee it was a while ago and like you still can recall it like that and that's, but that's only certain Meyer that it's only things that I'm interested in. See, I have a photographic memory for some things, but for things that I don't give a fuck about, there's no memory. That's why he wasn't good in school. He just didn't give it 100%. I remember like teachers that were annoying. Yeah. I remember funny things that happened in school.

Speaker 3:          02:30:57       I remember things that I learned that I thought were, was fascinating, but if I didn't care, like I, my brain only works for Shit I care about. If I, I'm like completely reckless in that regard. Like I didn't plan for the future at all. Never graduated college, never thought about it. Never like, man, I need to figure out a way to get a real job. Right? Nope. Nope. Not gonna do it for, from the jump. Like I went to college for three years, like completely just so that people didn't think I was a loser. This is the only reason why I barely paid attention. I went to Umass Boston and just fucking half it. I didn't even take my sats because I'm one out of college. I took a year off and I was like, well, eventually I'll take my sats, I'll go to school, get a degree. But that was a bullshit in myself.

Speaker 3:          02:31:42       And then a year later I was like, I gotta do something. I can't keep telling people that I'm eventually going to go back to college. So I started going, Umass Boston had this like continuing education program where you didn't even have to, um, have to, uh, have sat scores and he just had to have not failed high school, I guess. I don't remember how it exactly when, but I was wasting my time. I just said it was just going and half ass in it. And then three years in, they, uh, I think they told me I couldn't come back because my grades were really bad. So I, I remember I, I bullshitted and wrote this really eloquent response and uh, I wrote it all out and I was going to send it in and then I read it and I was like, if I put half as much effort into school as I did the bullshitting them with this really eloquent letter that I'm writing about, oh, I want to go to school, then I feel like I got to stop.

Speaker 3:          02:32:32       Just stop. I am not going to get a fucking normal job. I need to, I, my parents are completely disappointed in me, but it's okay. I'm already out of the house, so let's just, let's just run with this. You know, they didn't want me doing anything I ever did it. So let me just keep going. So the things that I'm interested in, like back then, if you asked me questions about taekwondo, which is what I was obsessed with back then, I would be able to tell you everything where it started, who created it, who invented this technique, who was first successful with this technique when they changed the variability of a, the how you use your hips. One. There's one style, it does it this way. Another style does die the way this is, this is the benefits of this is the benefits of that.

Speaker 3:          02:33:09       And I would be able to rattle off anything about things that I was interested in, but it was, it's like I have like a OCD, like obsessive weird brain, but it's not a good brain for like lawn care. Right. You know, it's not, it's not a good brain for remembering to pay your bills is not a good brain for like if I had a job and you know, you got to show effort to be a part of this company. This company is all about cooperation. See that board. We've got our tenants that we advised by fucking checked out. Gone. Yup. Second paragraph. I'm already trying to figure out how to make a live in delivering newspapers. Right. Don't have a boss or something

Speaker 1:          02:33:48       hilarious. I was horrible in school, man. Yeah, of course you are. That's why you were funny. But I would, I would ace all my tests without studying. Huh? Just cause I, I, I learned by listening and so I just keep my mouth shut a lot of times and I just absorbed that way. And then, so I listened to lectures or whatever. And then in high school you, most of your grade is your homework, but I'm like fuck the homework and I'd come in and ace my test and just barely passed with a c, you know, because I would at least get a little bit. And so then in college was, you know, they don't care

Speaker 4:          02:34:17       if you do your homework or not, you don't get graded on that. So I was like getting great grades in college. I just barely get by by just doing the homework. We're up by the, by ace and the test. You just have a really good brain. I mean, that's what it is. Yeah. Your brain works. I slept all day. I would stay up and watch the tonight show with Jay or Johnny Carson and I'd watch Letterman and then I would watch whatever was after that and then go to bed at like four in the morning, wake up at six, go to school for sleeping every single class. That's why we're happy to sit down and be like this, you know? And then, uh, somehow got a seat. Yeah, just got CS. I got C's all through high school. The problem with high school is that it's being taught by people that are not making any money.

Speaker 4:          02:34:57       No one gives a fuck about them. They, you only hear about with them when they make mistakes. Nobody's praising teachers for being amazing and being inspirational. It's so rare that teachers get any props. They, they are not financially compensated. Even though they have one of the most important roles in a child's development, they're not considered significant. Yup. It's a stupid fucking thing that we've done. We've created these really arcane, shitty, ineffective systems for education and it's rare that you get one. That's great. I mean, when you find a good school district, man, people fucking sell their house. So we moved to these neighborhoods, they do whatever. They can start sign their kid up right when they're born just to get into kindergarten. Yeah. Do whatever they can to get their kid into a good school system. And then the argument of like, you know, not paying the teachers as well, we don't want to pay him a lot of money and then attract the wrong kind of people.

Speaker 4:          02:35:43       Like, are you kidding me? Is that mean man, it so stupid. It's what, it's very aggravating. Yeah. Several teachers in my family is very frustrating to see the struggles that they go through and not having enough money in the budget to buy the fricking materials they need to teach the kids the curriculum. You know, it's, and, and that's not just like centralized to that school district. It is like nationwide, you know, it's gotta be fun because kids like to play. Like here's the thing, one of the things that drives me fucking bananas is this idea that kids that are bored in class have a disease. You the, he's got, oh, Eh,

Speaker 3:          02:36:21       a d h d o c d is, he's got something. He's not sitting. You're not supposed to sit. Okay. Little kids are supposed to be playing and there have low energy. Dude, I have little kids and my six year old, she's a fucking bundle of energy. They literally will run around the house screaming [inaudible] six and the four. They get together and they go and they just run. It's like they have a flame inside them. They need a burn off and you make a little kid sit in a class and pay attention. Pay Attention. Joshua, Joshua up here on the board. I want your eyes up here and you're like, oh my God, I gotta get Outta here. Yeah, your body's freaking out. Your body is literally freaking out. You just, you just want to get the fuck outta here. Meanwhile, you got a video game in your pocket, you want to play or you got a fucking comic book.

Speaker 3:          02:37:11       You want to read it right? Way more stimulating and interesting in this horse shit. This fucking ladies talking to you in Spanish. We're in America bench. Okay. Say, no, no, no, no, no. I don't want to hear it. I don't want to hear it. I gotta get Outta here. And that's, that's most kids through high school, you're, you're fucking, whether it's math or English or fucking history, you don't want to be doing that right then. And you know, the idea is that they're going to teach you discipline. You're going to sit there and now they're going to turn you into a god Damn Zombie. That's what they're gonna do. They're going to turn you into a cubicle Zombie. And if you let them, they will do it. Or if you resist, you can find your way out of the system. But the idea that you're not intelligent, unless you, you, you follow this ridiculous curriculum to turns you into a worker bee.

Speaker 3:          02:37:57       It's fucking stupid. It's a stupid, shitty plan that they've been following for a long fucking time. And it doesn't work on everybody. You're different than me. I'm different than you were all were fucking different. And every kid needs a different approach to absorbing information and you're going to have interest that I don't have. You know, like we were talking about video editing. If I had to go to fucking school or I had to become a video editor, I want, I'm not interested in it. It's not, I have no fascination. Like if you had to become a professional pool player, you've know fascination with it. It's like you, we all vary in our personality, in our life experiences and in what we're attracted to and some people are going to be attracted to different things. I believe that children should absolutely learn the basic building blocks.

Speaker 3:          02:38:45       Every kid should learn how to write, learn how to read. You should learn how to count. You should learn about the important facets of history. Agreed. Everyone. But the idea that every fucking kid should follow the same curriculum the same way. And how come nobody ever takes kids that are fucking antsy or the crack jokes all the time. Nobody ever pulls him aside and goes, hey man, should be a fucking comic. Yeah. Like you know, you could be a comic. There's thousands of them. Yeah. Like this is, we're not talking about be the president only going to be with to pull it. When I grew up, listen bitch, there's one fucking president won 350 million people. One guy gets to be president. Good luck. That's a shitty fucking job proposition. Yeah, you're your odds suck. But the odds of being a comedian put not bad. Right. You're actually funny. You can, oh, you're at, listen, Johnny, sit down. You're a fuck up. Okay. Here's the good news. So it was bill Cosby. So was Sam Kennison. That's right. So it was Richard Pryor. So is Eddie Murphy. They're all fuck ups. Okay. Who the fuck ups or comics? That's not all comics. You know, I'm sure there's probably comics that were like really studious and did great and a good grades. A lot of us were fuckups. That's right. That's right. God dammit Brian. He's right.

Speaker 6:          02:39:57       I guess it's so funny how many, like I always see the speeches people put with your, uh, from this podcast and like inspirational videos and stuff like that. You just had one the other day on break.com. I don't know if you know that where they, somebody took a, you doing a, uh, like kind of like a what you just did but put it together with like the videos and stuff. It's so amazing how many people listen to those and, and uh, uh, they're all over my Facebook nowadays. Of Your, of your,

Speaker 3:          02:40:33       I hope they help. I do. I hope they do. I don't mean it. I don't do it cause I hope someone's going to make a video out of it. I do it because I'm frustrated. I'm frustrated by people that I know that are just living in hell. I know too many people that just, they, there've been lied to and they don't have anybody around them that tells them any different. You don't have anybody around them tells them this. And Man, there's a lot of paths in this life. There's a lot of people that start their own businesses. There's a lot of people that sell art or you know, or, or, or become landscapers or do things that they enjoy or you know, become hunting guides or become, you know, someone who takes people on hiking tours. It was a lot of fucking different things to do in this life and everyone gets lumped in to these same paths and they're just shoving us in like fucking cattle and to these, these, these packed in paths where everybody wants to put that stupid hat on with the tassels paper that says, I'm not retarded. It's, it's fucking crazy, man. And you die just like everybody else dies. You live and you die. All you're supposed to be trying to do is make enough money to get by and be happy with what you're doing. You're going to like different shit. You're going to like different shit.

Speaker 1:          02:41:44       Yeah, it's ridiculous. I the um, what are they called? The counselors or whatever. The woman told me I was too stupid to go to college and then I shouldn't think about going into the military and that's what I'm saying, which pissed me off because they're, you know, that's stupid, but a military or learning a trade, that's what they told me and I learn a trade. Okay, I need to learn a trade or, well, neither of those interests me. Fuck, you should learn how to kill people. John, you're too stupid to go to college. You should go kill, sell insurance.

Speaker 3:          02:42:14       Be out shooting strangers. Yeah. For Uncle Sam. That's what they told me, man. I had horrible conversations with high school guidance counselors. They just work day. No hope. There's no hope you won't. You don't pay attention in school.

Speaker 1:          02:42:28       Nancy [inaudible] that was her name was killing me. Nancy Klezmer. Well, tell me about it. And so blinders, she was a large woman. She, um, I dunno when you're a kid, I don't think you really know how old people are, but she was probably mid to late forties at the time. So buried right next to John Candy. Oh my God. When she'd have fat, fuck the, in the casket, they put a suitcase full of snacks with her extra support. She, you know, yeah. It's like, but she, okay. So she tells that to me. Who else did she tell that to? It's hard, you know, and it's like, I, I thankfully kind of figured it out on my own, but how many people don't really figure it out that they just take that advice and go, oh shit. Well, I guess, I guess I should go learn to be a mechanic. Look, the world needs mechanics. I get, but you can't just tell someone that's their lot in life because you know they're too stupid or something. I mean there's some mechanics are very brilliant. I'm sure there's some stupid ones too.

Speaker 3:          02:43:21       Yeah. And there's some mechanics that wanted to be mechanics cause they love cars. They enjoy it. They get the thrill out of revving the engines and figuring out how to make things run better and figuring out how to, I like working on cars, but I don't want to do that for a living. You know, this is the idea that this woman can do that too. It's so disappointing that that person is, if that was my fucking kid, I would scream it. That lady, if you came home and you know, you told me that some lady told you you are too stupid to go to college and you had to be a mechanic or a a fucking soldier, I would scream at that lady. Yeah, I would want her fired. I'm like, you fucking monster. Like you know you're planting seeds. And these kids, you're telling a child they're too dumb. How smart are you that you got fat and you're working as a guidance counselor? You fucking dumb ass. You Ain't thinking shit. I know

Speaker 1:          02:44:08       I, if I came home and told my dad that he, you know, I didn't, but I know if I did he'd probably just would've been, well what branch do you want to go into? Like

Speaker 3:          02:44:15       that was your, that would have been his response. You know, that's probably why I didn't say anything. Yeah. My stepfather's thought for sure I was going to be liquor fucking construction worker or something. And then they have a lot of faith in me. But when you, you're coming home with all shit grades, they knew I was good at drawing. So like there's thoughts that I would be an artist, but then when I wasn't even into art and once I start to get into martial arts, it wasn't even an art anymore. So this is like this, this transitionary period between the age of 15 to like 17 where there wasn't a lot of shit going on in my life where they were really worried about me. Then I started winning all these taekwondo tournament. It's now like, okay, he's what? He's doing something good, you know? But even then they were worried about that and they didn't want, it was totally discouraging and they never saw me fight. Once I probably fought, I probably had a hundred amateur fights and my parents ever saw one of them. I won. Yeah,

Speaker 1:          02:45:03       he got out of the art because you were so good at it that at such a young age that, I mean like way better than most people.

Speaker 3:          02:45:10       I told you what happened. I had a really shitty art teacher in high school, asshole. He's just a really angry, bitter guy. He's just this pot belly dummy that had given up on life. He was just, this was this guy, this is my impression and my art teacher in high school, that's how he was. That was his energy and he didn't like me. He didn't like me because I was, I had, I had a lot of energy. I was dynamic. I wanted to just fucking run through walls. I mean, I was wired when I was a kid and everything I would draw was like dragons, eating villages and it was all like fucking people running for their lives, getting hacked to death by swords. I was an angry kid and I drew a lot of crazy shit. Werewolves tearing apart rib cages, you know. So that was what I drew, you know, and he was really interested in you.

Speaker 3:          02:45:52       He's like, you've got to stop doing that. But like this one I like, I like that kind of stuff. And I remember him saying this to me, well, if you get a job as an illustrator, you're going to perhaps have to draw something that you don't enjoy a drawing. Like maybe I'll have to do a diaper ad. Okay, so you're going to have to learn how to, um, I remember like I'm out. That's it. I'm not doing diaper ads. And so I stopped drawing. Wow. Yeah, I remember this guy was, so, it was just so negative. And influential because enthusiasm is very influential, but negativity is also influential. And I, he was connecting this world of failure to this guy's path and I was like, well I don't want to be an art teacher, like this fucking shithead. Just working with a bunch of people in squashing their dreams because it wasn't like I wasn't talented.

Speaker 3:          02:46:38       Like I still have those images and I've put some of them up on Instagram and I just should, I drew in 1983 okay. I was in high school. I have some of these pictures so I know I was talented and this guy just was a douchebag and he just didn't, he just gave me negative energy and so I was very insecure and very young and just dumb and you know, I just, I just stayed away. I didn't even take art my senior year in high school and that was my whole path. My whole path in life was I was going to be a comic book illustrator, you know, I was going to be like those guys that did like the x men or you know, an incredible hulk. That was my idea. Like, I could do that like, and I really could have done it, but I was just so turned off by shitty teachers just can't squash kids.

Speaker 3:          02:47:23       It's terrible. You can't do it. It's the worst thing ever, man. And it's so common. It's so common. Happens all the time. It's Ari Shaffir has a joke about it. He's got a joke about a, it's a new, one of his new bits about, uh, the notorious B I g you know, when a biggie was young, like he, he had uh, this rap to all the teachers have told me that you're going to grow up to be shit. You know, I don't want to say any more because it's a really funny joke and I want to give any of the, the joke away, but he has this whole bit about these teachers telling him that he wasn't going to be shit right. That notorious B I g was wasn't going to be shit. It's ridiculous. It's fucking common man. Cause people don't have vision and they don't have, how could we have known Josh McDermitt and that one day in Phoenix that you would grow up to be the man who's on my favorite show?

Speaker 3:          02:48:08       How can we ever, my second favorite show, I'm going to be honest with you at the game number one, but you guys are so strong, it's like one a and one B. It's like right up there, man. The, I've talked to a couple of their actors and they're fans of our show just as much as we're faced with. So like, you know, good for you. Okay. It's okay man. Like you're on one of the best shows ever. In my opinion. If it's a top 10 of my favorite shows of all time, you're on it. Who could have ever predicted that? Top Five. Okay. What do you got? Top five a surprise. I'm not going to make your name 10 soprano's game of Thrones walking dead. Dexter. First season stopper. Southpark always. Yeah. What else? Hmm? I'd have to go back. I was a, if I was five. Yeah, that was five. I'd have to go. I have to go back through my entire viewing history and think, Shit, oh, homeland is pretty Gundam good. Even that, even that show took a dip. I think it's pretty good. Uh, I don't remember. I don't know what season

Speaker 4:          02:49:08       we're in now, but as I watched it all on Amazon, so I don't know, last season, the last season is not as good. I don't know. I'm not current, but dare you've watched like two or three seasons. But I feel like, like part of the second season I'm going like, I don't care what's going on. Like I care about Saul, but I don't care about Harry Carey and bitch and uh, Brody. But she fucks like a wild animal. It was crazy ones. You know, the crazy ones, they know how to throw. Yeah, they trick you. That's a good show though. It's not as good as walking dead and it's not. It's definitely not as good. Well, it's good. It's great in moments, in moments, it's fantastic. But I call shows, man, it's fucking hard keeping this show. So solid episode after episode, season after season, it's gotta be one of the most difficult things to do.

Speaker 4:          02:50:02       It's tough. I like lost. Like I remember, um, like the last season of loss, I was totally done. I was so done. I didn't even watch the final episode. Yeah. I was like, fuck you. I checked out. I was angry at it. That's what I did with Dexter the last episode. I didn't watch until recently, uh, watch the whole series and didn't watch the last episode. I hurt so bad. It ended better than you would imagine. Uh, but lost if you really real watch lost and pay attention to what, you know, you're supposed to pay attention to him, it really changes the show. It really makes it a lot better. Yeah. That make, that kind of makes sense. Just read something online about one of the, uh, one of the writers was at a dinner party and they were talking to him about like all the crazy shit that was inserted into the show, the polar bears or whatever.

Speaker 4:          02:50:50       Like there's so many things that didn't tie up at the end and he said, yeah, we never had any intention of that was just a can choose to define it. It was just thrown literally throwing in whatever. It's freaking me. Blow out smoke monsters and shit. I love that. I absolutely loved that. There were some great moments in that show. There were some great moments in that show, but it was rapidly inconsistent. As was Dexter like Dexter, first season, no one. Dexter went downhill. It went downhill when that dude stop lifting weights because the first season he looked like a killer. He looked like a guy could grab people and strangle them and beat their asses and stab and then they started getting like scrawny. Was that cause cancer though? Whatever. Excuses, excuses, leukemia. Walk it up. Pussy.

Speaker 4:          02:51:36       I don't mean this. Ladies and gentlemen. All right, we should probably wrap this bitch up. I think I ran at of time. Josh motherfucking, mic dot. Dude. Thanks for having me on. Thanks for, thanks for being on and don't quit comedy. You're too fucking funny. Not quitting and I know it showed a nosy. Got a nice cushy Gig on the walking dead. You've got to show tonight. Where can people see you doc? I'm not promoting it. I mean I don't know where it is. It's in Long Beach, Long Beach. Just Google it. You'll find them. It's probably at the laugh factory in Long Beach. Is that where it is or isn't? It's not that.

Speaker 3:          02:52:05       It's like a one night show. So some Weirdo spot. All right, my friend, uh, you could follow Josh and I found it on roadmaps. Ah, you can follow Josh onto twitch. Sure it is Josh McDermitt. D. E. R. M. I. T. T. O. Yeah. Uh, and uh, do you have a website? Uh, I do. Josh mcdermitt.com. Oh, Sam, Instagram and Facebook.

I haven't separated you from the character though. I'm enjoying your character, which I thought was weird cause I know you as a human being. Yeah. But you know, I'm like, that's all good, Josh. Okay. But it's all right. You know, I still like, it doesn't take away from the enjoyment at all, except you as this wacky, fake scientists dude. But I still know it's you. It's awesome.
