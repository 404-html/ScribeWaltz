Speaker 1:          00:00:10       Okay,

Speaker 2:          00:00:18       the Joe Rogan experience

Speaker 1:          00:00:21       Joe Rogan podcast by Katie Bowman.

Speaker 3:          00:00:27       Ladies and gentlemen, move your DNA. You could find her on twitter aligned and. Well she's friends with Rob Wolf, so she must be cool. And you're here. What's up? How are you? I'm doing well. How are you? Good. I didn't want to talk to you too much before the show because we were talking about something that I'm very interested in about how you live in Washington state. You found some clever area where it's in Washington but it's not rainy every day where you actually get sun. That's true. How'd you do that?

Speaker 2:          00:00:55       Magic. You know, I followed my family that someone else found that magic and like how it always happens. I decided to go up there too.

Speaker 3:          00:01:05       And it's uh, you can see like Vancouver and Vancouver island right from where you're at. Yeah. I could row a boat to Canada if I had to. If the shit hit the fan shit, hit the fan and I got my out. Well that's what you started talking about. You started talking about like living off the wild and, and that's something that you're really concerned with, like are you a prepper?

Speaker 2:          00:01:24       I'm not, I, I'm not really concerned with it, but it Kinda goes hand in hand with what I teach about natural movements, like I'm trying to put back these isolated pieces of how you eat and how you move and how you think and where you spend your time and even where you spend your money of going. Well, if we all just kind of go spend a little bit more time out in, in nature. Um, but I mean more than the park. I mean, I really mean wild. You can see how it's been done for a long period of time. So trying to figure out how to get more movement goes naturally with trying to figure out how to acquire your own foods. So I thought, well I'm a parent of two little kids. I have a limited amount of time. So what if our food acquisition is our movement is our teaching, our kids is our family, time is everything and it's the same hunk of time and we're just out there in the wild. I love it.

Speaker 3:          00:02:17       Then you're in an area that's particularly like dense with wilderness, with trees, with animals and that whole area of the Pacific northwest. It's such a. When you were talking about how you come to California and everything's so dry, it's almost like where's the life? But if you go up there, there's so much life. It's ridiculous. Well, I went up there with my friend Duncan. We were hunting for bigfoot, was for a TV show and we went wandering through the woods. But the thing, the soaps, that's my computer isn't working. The sound wasn't working up until then. We got an issue with stream. This is, we have a totally new setup. So we're an hd now. So you look lovely in hd. Um, we were, uh, we, we just got this new computer and this whole jazz and we would maybe we should just run the show for like a minute before we go live. That's what we'll do next time, but uh, anyway, when we went up there, like when you're wandering around through the forest up there, the thing that is so shocking is how many animals there are and how much life there as you see elk crap everywhere and all these birds and rodents and just so many, so many, so much variety of life up there

Speaker 2:          00:03:27       and that's the big stuff you can see underneath every footprint. There's like one or 200 organisms living in every foot footprint that you take there because it's just, it's so deep. It's just dense. Dense is, it's the densest place on the planet. It is dense of, of plant and animal stuffs.

Speaker 3:          00:03:47       Yeah. And you don't have to worry about drought up there. Not this millennia. Well, not like we do here in California that we need 11 trillion gallons of water just to balance out what's been lost over the last three years.

Speaker 2:          00:03:59       Yeah. And even more, even even more. I guess alarming to me is less than the total water, but the amount of organization amongst people it takes to get it here like that. I, you know, that's always what I was worried about failing here. Yeah, the water supply, the food supply, the infrastructure, the infrastructure, the delivery system, because none of it is actually here like, like I'm just thinking of something like a power outage where so much of your water is dependent on it being cleaned and all of that is depends on energy that requires a bunch of people. Like my, my in laws who live here in California, their house has been without power for two weeks and they live in an area north of Orange County and they had to bring a generator. They put a generator into a neighborhood because they're like, well, it's got to dig for it and frankly we don't have the manpower right now. And they're like, when I started hearing stuff like that, that's when I flee to the Pacific northwest

Speaker 3:          00:04:55       so that there's an issue with their lines. The power lines are down or something like that and so they have to dig for the lines to put them back up. So to live in like the camping

Speaker 2:          00:05:04       for two weeks, camping in a very affluent area in Orange County. I mean this is like, you know, a nice neighborhood, really nice neighborhood now where you live, do you have neighbors? And we do want me to have two and a half acres and, but there are, there are some neighbors, you know, but it's not um, within the whole town, the whole town's pretty small and you can get to a place to see nobody, you know, within 10 minutes, which I like.

Speaker 3:          00:05:35       Yeah, that is nice if you want to get to nobody in 10 minutes. But I find that like when you're in small towns and small areas, the real issue is finding a cool small town with a good sensibility, a nice, intelligent small town. Because you can find some small towns, like if you drive from southern California up to northern California, you can drive through some spots. You have these giant Mitt Romney signs that are still up. And there's the weird religious signs and these strange really sketchy communities. You're like, oh boy, you got a pretty view, but fuck these neighbors.

Speaker 2:          00:06:10       Yeah, it's a retirement community, but you know, you are where I am. It's a retirement community because it was a, it used to be a, um, a logging town, so it's, it's got this waterway there, it's next to some ports. And so they've been moving with their and milling it up and there's some paper mills, but a lot of that business has shut down as people are buying stuff from overseas. And then of course as the wood is not being able to be replenished as fast as they'd been taking it down. So I think in sunset magazine somebody wrote an article about this town that you could buy a few acres and, and that it wasn't this what they call a rain shadow. So it's in the banana belt. It's sunny almost every single day. Totally different than any other place in Oregon or Washington. And you could buy an acre for it long enough.

Speaker 2:          00:06:57       It was like $60,000 or $70,000. So a whole bunch of people went out there, there's no, there's no work or anything, but they bought their homes and they built them up, but they're all kind of dying now. The people, the people who originally were there, so, so it's not that ideal, small kind of funky ideal town yet. But I decided, well I can make that happen. You were going to make sure I can do that. Like people in. I'm not really about waiting around for the ideal to happen. I'll just build it from the ground up. Sure, yeah, there you go.

Speaker 3:          00:07:30       And so, um, this area that you're at, do you take your kids out fishing and take them out gathering food and all that jazz?

Speaker 2:          00:07:37       Yeah. So it's huge. A huge reservation land where we are. So the salmon is unreal. I live on the dungeness river, so all the crap, like all the crab that you met here from Dungeness, that's where it comes from. So the, the um, the first nation peoples that lived there, the food was so abundant, like that's all the things like, um, totem poles and big dugout canoes that you see that came about because they didn't have to really worry about food. It's like listless of elk today. Let's just sit here until one walks by, wait till Baird's walks by, you know, the berries and the fruit and the wild Greens and, and then again the fish you could, you know, depending on the time of year, just grab one out of the water, you know, if they're sponsors, it's not hard to eat there. So I thought, what a great place.

Speaker 3:          00:08:23       There's so many elk up there. I took a photograph of an elk standing in front of a no hunting signs

Speaker 2:          00:08:28       close

Speaker 3:          00:08:29       because it was like, right, right when we were driving, these elk were just wandering across the road and they were just standing in front of this no hunting. So I'm like, this is ridiculous. That was the first elk I'd ever seen in the wild to. Those things are huge. They're huge. Yeah. Like if you ever hit one with your car, I

Speaker 2:          00:08:44       have not come close. I've been waiting waiting for that to happen. They don't seem. That bright. Light seems smarter than a lot of people. I know. Maybe that shows the area that you're living with. That's true. They're cautious. They're fleeting. There's a little a herd of them that lives in our town there, that mascot of this little town, and so there's a hurt and they've got collars around their neck and we've got elk flashing lights so you can their colors because they just kind of. Maybe they are dumb. Maybe they just kind of stumbled across the freeway every now and then, so they flash up when they're close to the highway. The one on either side is they're moving back and forth from the ocean, so the gps collar collar that that the government, the local government is fitted them with so that they can kind of track where they're going to be in light the sign up. When the color comes close to these signs, you know, that's where the elk are. So you can sometimes look up and see the whole herd sitting in the past year or you know, maybe walking across the freeway

Speaker 3:          00:09:42       seems weird. I feel like I kind of liked the idea that, you know, they know where they are, but to put a collar on him and be able to track them and seems like that's not wild anymore. Then you just roaming pet.

Speaker 2:          00:09:54       Yeah. Yeah. Maybe it will their mascots wildish roaming mascots. Wildish wildish eat them. No. No. I mean by whom? No, like hunting laws. No, I don't. I don't know if all of them are colored. I think maybe just a couple of the males are so then no, you wouldn't be allowed. Kenny them really can't shoot them. I don't know. They're not, they're not really like hunting area. They're like in these kind of like the neighborhoods. Maybe they're dumb. Maybe they're totally.

Speaker 3:          00:10:22       You'd be amazed at some areas that you can hunt in there. Like a, there's an area called Evergreen Colorado and uh, one of the issues that they have is the local laws allow you to essentially hunt in your backyard. If you have more than x amount of land, not much, it's like two acres or something like that. I might be butchering this law, but I remember there was some sort of a, um, an issue online when people debating it because people were firing off guns and their backyard, like shooting it elk and deer and they're like, oh, this is kind of fucked up. Like we're not, we're not really in the woods man. Like my swing set is 100 yards to the right. So, um, but they have so many animals up there. It's such a rich abundance of animals and the people that rely on them for a large part of their food, you know, moderate income or lower income families, if they get an elk, like, boy that is a year's worth of meat. Like you've got a 1300 pound animal, you're going to get 400 plus pounds of meat from that. That's 400 meals, you know. So for a lot of people that is literally a year's worth of meat for your family. So they'll just shoot that fucker right in their backyard.

Speaker 2:          00:11:32       Yep.

Speaker 3:          00:11:33       Everybody's got a duck for a couple minutes and come on over. I'll give you a ham. The salmon fishing up there must be amazing.

Speaker 2:          00:11:41       Amazing, amazing. Actually, when does the weirdest going down? You know, they, there was a dam up there for a really long time, like 100 years that they've just taken down. You can actually watch the deconstruction of this dam a couple of years

Speaker 4:          00:11:54       and we were walking around at the bottom of what has been, you know, this damned up body of, of water and some friends of ours were biologist took us upstream because they're there, they're doing a lot of salmon restoration, you know, they're trying to get everything back to what it was a couple of hundred years ago because it's very different because of this dam. And he is our friend Keith. He just reached down and he picked up the salmon like right out of the water, this huge thing. I mean the thing was a foot and a half more. It was 15 pounds and he just picked it right up and he was like, here's where the eggs are. And then he. Then it turned out to be a male and he just grabbed it and he just shot all of the salmon. Salmon is also the river because they're spawning and he just, he just deals with salmon all day long.

Speaker 4:          00:12:40       It was amazing. Was opponent out of a weird, like a salmon? We're. Or was he pulling out of the river was retarded because they're spawning so when they're spawning they just rub up against anything. Well they're just, when they're spawning, you know, they're trying to get to kind of shallow water. So a lot of them are kind of, you know, they have to make it up through the river even as the river changes in terms of volumes. So where it's a little low, they just kind of walk up. It kind of take themselves out of the water. They're, they're amazing. Well, I mean I've seen bears pulled them out on tv, like in deeper waters because they're jumping. These ones are actually on the ground, but they're just wiggling. Yeah. So he said the females will be way more scratched up. You can tell during spawning season a male versus a female because the female is just really desperately trying to get her eggs to someplace.

Speaker 4:          00:13:31       And I guess the male just drop his load kind of wherever he's less intense about it. Goofy designed by nature, Huh? Yeah. Or, or just amazing like in what I find interesting is so salmon that they're raising in, um, whatever they call it, like in the fisheries, you know, in the hatcheries, the identify them because they remove what they will call like a vestibular Finn. This, I think it's called an adipose Finn. Um, so that they can recognize which ones are wild in which ones are introduced. But, but um, and I was talking to some biologists in part of a lot of stuff that I do is, is kind of redefining what's actually this digital era and what's just, we don't know what it is, so it must not be necessary anymore. And he said, well, it's interesting because he was explaining it's kind of like the appendix of the fish. It's not really necessary. And I was like, well, it turns out that our appendix isn't really as digital as it was once thought, you know, it's a little bit more necessary. And it is. Yeah, it's not, it has a role whether that role is challenged by modern living, that's really more where, what the issue is. If it still is, it still is harboring. I can't remember exactly what it is. It's harboring some sort of bacteria depending on the exposure. You have two different foodstuffs and I'll

Speaker 2:          00:14:52       have to look it up a little bit more. But. But he said it's interesting that you say that because they're wondering why these fish don't do really, really well. So perhaps it's because they're removing the fin and as I did a little bit more research on that fin that Finn in particular deals with assisting swimming through very particular types of turbulence. And so it, it is, it's not something that you use 100 percent of the time, but it's used over the lifetime of a salmon. Just put like a tag on that thing instead of dragging it off. Too much drag. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know, there's so many problems to solve and so little time,

Speaker 5:          00:15:29       well, so many problems to solve when your people and you want to fuck with animals, want to cut their fins off and put collars on their elk in this area that you live in. Sounds like ideally it sounds beautiful. It is. And does this have anything to do with what you do for a living? Does it have anything to do with what you're all about? Movement and alignment and

Speaker 2:          00:15:51       like I'm all about natural movement and an alignment being a component of that, but I would say that the reason we moved up there as we were just unable to execute our life the way with we wanted here, like there was, there's a, there's a physical blockage to moving in the way that we need to move and I was like, well the only way to remove that blockage is to take ourselves away from the environment that's limiting this, this way of moving, which is, which is larger than it sounds. It's not like, you know, make sure you get these seven exercises into your workout. It's, it's, it's very broad and it has to do with the loads that your body experiences and then that goes for light and noise and all the different ways your cells are deformed by your habitat. So if, when you talk about, when I talk about movement, I really like in the way that we move to be similar to animals that are in zoos. Like if you ever go to a zoo and check out that kind of unfortunate thing, you'll see these animals and they have movement, you know, they have,

Speaker 2:          00:16:57       yeah, cages or habitats designed for them, but the way that they used them is pretty narrow and it goes for us as well. So that's, that's, that's why the move. I just wanted less people, more space, less rules, less noise, more water.

Speaker 5:          00:17:12       Yeah. And when you say like we're being deformed or like in what way?

Speaker 2:          00:17:18       Well in the book, the analogy that I use, because I think it's easiest to understand is if you look at workers in a place like sea world, have you seen their folded over fin? That's the kind of defamation that I'm talking about. I'm talking about like um, you are shaped really by the forces that you experience all the time. Your mechanical environment is 100 percent of the time and so the resultant shape of your body

Speaker 2:          00:17:45       is based on this exposure in the same way that the Orca was missing input, it was missing mechanical input and it was exposed to high levels of mechanical input that gets this result in shape, you know, in, in the difference between what the Orca is. When you look at an Orca, it's like clearly it's not supposed to be at seaworld and clearly that shaped doesn't seem conducive to swimming, you know, at least in a straight line. So we don't see that in ourselves very well though because we are the Orca in the tank and everyone else is in the tank with us. So it's really hard to see how you would have been shaped and it's really hard to imagine what the resultant shape of us would be culturally if, if there were more examples of people who moved in drastically different ways, which there are not.

Speaker 5:          00:18:33       Well, I know posture is a big issue with Americans. It's a big issue with anybody in all parts of the world that have to sit at desks all the time. You know, the expression sitting is the new smoking. We've tried really hard in this place to change that up. We've got these desks or these chairs from Ergo depot. These are called Cup Pisco. I had a couple different ones before I started off with regular chairs like that, but by the end of the podcast, my back, I've had some back issues with Jujitsu. I had a bulging disc at one point, my cervical spine and that's all healed up now, but if I sit in something like that and I kind of have that hunch thing that you get from a chair by the end of the show, I'll just get stiff in my back. But with these things, nothing. So something that forces you to sit erect, you realize like how few of us actually do that and how many people are like have that weird hunch spine thing going on, which constantly puts pressure on your spine and I never thought anything of that until I started doing this fucking podcast and I'm like sitting down all the time, all day.

Speaker 5:          00:19:36       And it just, it really puts into perspective how many people are doing it. Not Me for three hours a day. They're doing eight, nine, 10 hours a day even more staring at computers all day. Everyone's going blind early. Right? You know, I'm uh, my, my vision sucks. It used to be really good, but now I need, I need reading glasses to read stuff that's close up and I know it has something to do with age, but it definitely has something to do with staring at monitors too. It's just not good for you.

Speaker 2:          00:20:01       No. And it's the distance, you know. Um, I, I tried to talk about casts, casts, casts. When you break your arm, those are really easy to see. There's like a physical structure that you can't move your arm. It's really harder to see these invisible casts so distance the distance of something from your eye is a cast upon the Lens, so when you look at something, what allows you to focus on that is that the distance that you're looking at, your, your mind, your, your musculature of the. I will change the shape of your lens so that that distance is what you're looking at. When you want to see something farther, you look up and you look at it and then these muscles, these ciliary muscles in the eye will change the shape of the eye and allow you to focus that to that distance. But humans, modern humans in the places where we live very rarely look beyond 20 feet.

Speaker 2:          00:20:55       I mean you're not looking at anything. I mean, so like you can say that it's the screen because the screen is two feet away and there's certainly a much greater frequency of screen use. Like by the time you look at your ipod or your iphone and you're looking at your computer and doing whatever work that's on that, that number has gone up. But what's always been high is that you don't see much beyond the walls of your house. So that's another reason you don't have the ability to look very far indoors, does not allow you to look very far. And so right now with that vision, with kind of understanding like why is Myopia, which is that near sightedness coming up with such great frequency years to be one kid in school with glasses, right? And now there are seven or eight, you got one third of the classroom who can't see at ages six and seven kids are starting now to be put in glasses like in four and five years old because they've been looking.

Speaker 2:          00:21:49       They don't even have outdoor playtime, you know, they're not even going outside. And so they know that outdoor time is a factor in those and have less myopia. So then they're trying to test it like, is it the near work? And I, I wrote a piece about this that there's a difference between going outside. So they're like, is it the vitamin D? Is it the light exposure? But they were able to figure out by isolation that it wasn't that, and so then I. my contribution is, well, what about distance looking? That distance looking itself is a different variable in something that you don't. It's not a load to the eye that we're, I'm very experienced with. But if you had to again go out and get your food and you were moving around, it's not just that you're outside more. It's a. You need to be able to see things kind of far away.

Speaker 2:          00:22:36       If you've ever gone hunting. Hunting is, especially if we're doing like spot and stock type hunting, being able to look at long distances and seeing and spotting animals, you know, before you make your way over there, that's a skill to be able to look 30 or 40 or 60 feet to the top of a tree to kind of see what's up in there. That's just a. it's a part of your workout that you're missing, so to speak. You're not cross training your eyes with enough types of exercises. You do two feet and you do however far your television is, and then maybe the. The bumper of the car in front of you, I mean we're not distance lookers at all anymore,

Speaker 5:          00:23:10       so have ophthalmologists and optometrists have, they've sort of just accepted the fact that people, their eyes are just going to go bad because this is the environment we live in. So this is just an inevitable fact of aging. And is that something that can be avoided by spending a lot of time outdoors, looking at long distance stuff and looking at things that are 100 yards away, 500 yards away and focusing your, your vision on those things?

Speaker 2:          00:23:31       Yeah. Well I don't, I don't think they want you to accept it. It's not. I mean it's not an inevitable thing. That's why they're working on the literature for it. So the actual researchers in eyes are trying to find like what it is, do we need more supplementation? But they're like, kids really

Speaker 4:          00:23:46       do need to be outside a lot more. Um, because the shape of the size of your eye is changing. And so when the eye freezes or as cast by something near and then your eyes start growing, but the lens has to stay the same size, then you have this mismatch between the size of your eye and the Lens. And so that's why this childhood myopia kind of starts moving with you into adulthood and you become an adult that needs glasses. So. So yes, they are calling for that intervention. And then there's a lot of I exercise programs, you know, people trying to create some sort of corrective. My recommendation is you got to get yourself near a window if you're an office worker and you have to just take an eyebrow, you need to look as far away as possible just to. It's like if you did a bunch of curls, bicep curls, and you never ever put your arm down, it's like you did them all.

Speaker 4:          00:24:35       And then when you were done, you tied it up there. You can imagine what the shape of the bicep would look like and the function of the elbow and the shoulder and how eventually that bicep would not just pull your lower arm up to your upper arm, but would start to pull your shoulder in towards your upper arm. Same thing goes with the eyes, you know, first the muscles that move the shape of the Lens, do that, but then the tighter they are, the more they begin to pull the whole structure of the eyeball down itself. And then you're starting to look at, well, how does that affect the pressure of the eye? And in, in so many things that occur in the body are, um, mechanically sensitive. You know, you, all your pressures are depend on all your pressures everywhere else. And when you start to forming the shape of structures, it does start effecting those functions that are positioned dependent, which is almost all of them

Speaker 5:          00:25:26       sort of like when people were a wallet in their pockets, bulging discs. That's a really common thing with folks. Have you, you don't know if you have a wallet and you put it in your back pocket, please stop doing it. Um, I recently, I used to get mocked because I had a wallet chain because I lost my wallet twice. Okay. Relax people. Plus they look kind of sweet. But uh, I got this wallet recently. It's a front pocket wallet, just keeps a few credit cards and my driver's license and that's it. I went and minimalist and ever since I did that I just, I'm aware that I can just sit down and have to pull it because I would always take my wallet out of my pocket and then sit down, which is one of the reasons why I wanted it attached to a chain because I'm absentminded, but people that have these big fat wallet, everybody gives you a business card all.

Speaker 5:          00:26:09       Let me just stick that in there. You're sitting on a brick, you know, you're sitting on an encyclopedia, stuff that sucker into your pocket and you've got this weird angle that you're at all the time. You're always sitting in a weird lump and soft tissue is very pliable and that's something that. It's also something that really frustrated me about getting a back injury was how many people were like, well, you're going to have to get surgery, and I was like, oh, what the fuck? Like there's no way to fix this. There's no way to stretch this out. There's no way to. It's compressed, right? Have suffered Capri. Is there a way to decompress it? And then I went to other people and like, yeah, of course we do decompression therapy. Like, okay, well what the fuck? Well, how come this doctor is telling me that you got to cut my back, and then there's.

Speaker 5:          00:26:50       Have you ever heard of the reverse hyper machine? Yes. Louie Simmons, this guy from west side barbell in Columbus, Ohio, created this amazing machine that I have in the back now that I use almost every day. It's fantastic because it offers decompression and this incredible strengthening of the back. It's this amazing machine that as you you're lifting up your. You're flexing your back and is very unusual way that it's really hard to work out any other way and then on the release it's actually actively decompressing your spine, so it's because of guys like him. Louis Siemens is powerlifter genius, sort of bio mechanic dude who figured out he had an injury and they wanted a fuses discs and he was like, fuck that, you know, let me let me figure out a way around this, and he figured out a way and he fixed it and he fixed it through this.

Speaker 5:          00:27:39       Just using what he knows about exercise and the mechanics of the body and coming up with some sort of machine that would allow the decompression of that soft tissue and that's something that I think we all have to be aware of when it comes to posture. Posture is a giant one with people. I had terrible posture like most of my life until I started getting back issues and one of the things that I realized is even though I was healthy and strong, I was able to avoid a lot of pain that was associated with that bad posture. The bad posture was still screwing me up and like just being able to sit up straight. It just feels odd when you do it, but if you do it and like you force your, it's like an active exercise. You force yourself to do it, you want a slump because it's like you feel like you're using less energy but you're really screwing your body up when you do it

Speaker 2:          00:28:29       and you're using less energy. Yeah. Which is, which is fine in some cases. I mean using less energy is good in some cases, but I think it has has less to do with like with good posture, but the thing with the thing with posture, his posture is this modern construct that has arisen in a culture that doesn't move at all. Right? So it's really like what's the optimal way to be still because that's the wrong question or asking kind of the wrong question. Yes. That's the first question. The first question is to assume that there is nothing you can change about your life, that you can't move to a wonderful place in, cultivate a wonderful city to live in, but right now if you feel stuck in your job, the tendency is to make that environment better, but I always like to point out that posture isn't something that you would be as concerned about if you were moving a lot more in general that the resting tensions of your body would be doing all the things that you know, we're trying to do in small blips on, on different machines, in posture classes. You know, in posture books. They just got to move more to.

Speaker 5:          00:29:33       And also even standing up though, even if you are moving, like there's a lot of people that move and they of have that hunch for thing going on and even if you're out there doing stuff like especially like when you're exercising you, you put a tremendous amount of pressure on your back and really weird ways if you don't use proper posture like with squats and things along those lines. It's so super important.

Speaker 2:          00:29:55       Yeah. Forum forum is huge during your workout and all the other times too.

Speaker 5:          00:30:01       Yeah, and form for everything, not just for lifting weights for martial arts, of course, this gigantic, you know, doing things correctly. If you do things incorrectly, you put a lot of load on weird areas of your joints and your hips and your back. And so many people want to be healthier. So many people want to be. They wanted to get out of this Rut they're in and, and get there. But it seems like the, just a modern life that most people are either found themselves in by circumstance by lack of understanding, but whatever it is you find yourself in this, this way or this way of life, which it almost makes it incomprehensibly difficult to like be healthy, to be fit, to be, to have a body that functions correctly. If you're sitting in a desk all day, like what are the things that people should be concentrating on if they find themselves stuck in a work environment, you're in a cubicle. Like is there a way to mitigate that?

Speaker 2:          00:31:00       There is. Um, I think one of the things that I've known for most is that thinking, if you think about in terms of like your exercise, a lot of people will try to figure out like, healthy to them as what are you doing for exercise? What are you eating for your diet? So you're, you're, you're trying to maximize those two categories, but um, you've got all of this other time in which you are getting your work done and you can make that healthier too. So like we know you were talking about your wallet for example, when I was thinking, you know, you put this big hunk under one hip and so you take it out. Well a lot of people put two big hunks of wallet, dish type stuff under their feet every single day. And they call them shoes. You know, they'll put like a big, big wedge about high heels.

Speaker 2:          00:31:48       I'm talking about trainers, you know, like your athletic shoe could have an inch and a quarter is standard, a man's dress shoes almost two full inches. We'd, it's not sin in spiky and Fashiony, but, but that is the equivalent to the wallet. It's just because it's symmetrical. We think of, well, it's symmetrical, like the thing, your wallet under your hip. It's not just that it's asymmetrical. If you had a wallet in each hip, either the problems of having something underneath under that soft tissue would still be there. It would just. It would be more subtle. You wouldn't have this big torque there as well. It would just be kind of continuous pressure, but people put stuff on their feet every single day that affects every other joint north of their ankle. And then you compensate all day long your whole entire life you've been compensating. And over time you lose. You lose parts to your body. You lose little. The little contract

Speaker 4:          00:32:40       components that make up muscle, like the sarcomeres that make up your muscle length. Those just go away. You cannibalize those, um, which means you lose range of motion, which means even when you go to move your parts during this part of your life that you've set aside to move, which is different than the rest of your life that you've set aside to not move. You're moving less, you're moving less of you. So that's, that's always a huge one. Like what if I told you your whole body would work better if you fix what you were putting on your feet everyday, you're just going to put shoes on any way, like what does it matter what they are? If you could put on a pair of shoes that allowed your whole body to function in a different way, it would be the equivalent to saying, I got this new workout, like this new cross training piece.

Speaker 4:          00:33:21       Your workout is stale, you're not as strong as you should be, or that you'd like to be. For the thing that you're doing that you can introduce whole new load spectrum to your body just by changing your shoes would have. What do you think about those? What are they called? Mbts? Is that what it was called? The barefoot technology. The rocker bottom ones. What are the. What's the deal with those? Those stupid. Well, there are a rocking chair for your feet, so if you want it, like if you ever sit down in a rocking chair, that's called momentum and that's not something you want in your gait pattern. You don't want your shoes to be throwing you forwards that you don't have to expend as much energy to do it, that you balance yourself constantly on those things and in doing that you're using all those little muscle groups. Is that all bs? I don't know if it's all BS. It's just. It doesn't get. Its mostly bs. Mbs isn't there? Almost called MTS mpt. It's just this bigger like I don't know. I always think a lot larger than that. I'm thinking about like there is a cellular environment, there is a nutritious movement, like it's the equivalent to nutritious food is that there is a way to move that as nutritious to your body and you're missing some huge nutrients so you should wear flat shoes all the time.

Speaker 4:          00:34:37       Flexible, flexible. There's a little bit of a bottom to that. There's more on the. If you grab him, if he grabbed them and bend them over, what do they do? Like here's my shoes, flip flops. That's it. Yeah, but also, but decidedly not flip flops because if you put, if it's just flip flops then you have to grab to hold them and then you've got all this tension and your foot and your gait patterns all messed up from, from natural, just to hold on the thing on your foot. So it's kind of like your, your movement is very reflexive, you know, you are an animal, you're a primate and in your movements should be much more reflective than it's happening right now. And in one of the reasons that makes it so difficult is because of all of these casts, these, these things that we put on everything. It's fascinating that you refer to like a cast for your eyes because I never thought about it that way, but as soon as you said, I was like, oh, that totally makes sense. Like your house is kind of a cast is a cast, the cast being in a work environment, an office as a cast,

Speaker 5:          00:35:38       not looking at things for large distances. That is a cast. Um, the, the shoe thing I wear converse all stars most of the time because of that, because they're flat and they're really flexible and light. Those are okay.

Speaker 2:          00:35:49       Those, those would be helpful. Can you spread your toes out wide but then there's this whole other level. Why is that important? There's muscles in their 25 percent of the number in your muscles. In your body or from your ankle down. Maybe you. Maybe not me. No, you might have more muscles. Not Muscle mass. Muscle mass.

Speaker 5:          00:36:07       I'm just talking shit. What about those toe shoes?

Speaker 2:          00:36:10       Toe Shoes. I liked the toe shoes. You get a little bit more for that, but you have to, you have to transition pretty hard. It's like you've been wearing cast, like if you broke your arm you wouldn't cut it off and then start doing cartwheels and stuff. Why do all my workouts barefoot? That's great.

Speaker 5:          00:36:26       I do all my weightlifting barefoot. All my martial arts stuff is off course barefoot. But uh, like sometimes I'll take pictures of a gym workouts and like, what are you doing barefoot? Man, you crazy going to drop things on your feet. I guess what, man, you drop things in your feet normally you're fucked anyway. If you're lifting 400 pounds, if you have shoes on, you're still fucked. It's gonna. Smush your toes. Just don't drop things on your feet. Dummy. How often do you drop things on your feet? I don't drop things on my feet. I pay attention.

Speaker 2:          00:36:53       Well, that's the thing. If, if, if you go barefoot, you learn how to pay a lot of attention.

Speaker 5:          00:36:58       Yeah, little kids, man. My Kid's stomped on my feet all the time. I'm barefoot around the house and they love it. They think it's funny, but I'm. While I'm teaching my six year old daughter a teacher, kickboxing and so now she thinks it's funny to just run up on me and leg kicked me and it's starting to get hard. Like she's six and she's. She knows how to whip her body into it. Now she's a little athlete. She knows how to turn your hips because I've taught her like how to really generate force. So the other day she came up to me and she did this like perfect pivot and whack and just dug one right into my calf. I was like, oh, you little fucker. Like it was good. It was good. I was proud of how it's pretty good. But I didn't see it coming.

Speaker 5:          00:37:37       You know, they just, they, well when there's six they feel like you're invulnerable. So they just tee off on you whenever they want, you know, we can't let them know. But I mean it doesn't really hurt yet but it's like, hey you gotta we've got about four more years of that before we're going to have an issue. When she gets to like 13, 14, you could really hurt somebody. So don't only do it to me. We have like rules in our house. We're only allowed to hit daddy and you know, he can't hit each other but you could hit daddy. And so we, we play just by. I just feel like the best way to teach the martial arts is to show them the techniques, but then actually have them hit a person because you can hit punching bags and stuff all you want, but I want them to like specifically target areas like this is the area supposed to hit I. This is why you're supposed to hit this area. So I let him hit me like a lot of barefoot stuff. Point is.

Speaker 2:          00:38:26       Yeah, and a lot of people don't. Don't do anything barefoot. So if you're doing, you know the bulk of your movement with barefoot, that's great, but you could also do your podcast barefoot. Really? Why would that help?

Speaker 5:          00:38:36       Why does it help your workout? But I'm moving my feet around. I'm sitting here will move around. I would suggest that you move around more to like wiggle my toes around. People are weird. They're sitting around barefoot somehow or another would with girls. It doesn't bother me, but like if I'm sitting like Eddie Bravo, I love Eddie. Bravo two dads is a good buddy of mine. That dude's always barefoot. It was playing with his feet and stuff like, come on, man, puts his feet up on tables in a restaurant and just. He's always stretching. He's super. He's a Jujitsu master, so he was always like, got one foot here and one foot here is always pushing his weight down, stretching himself. He's always barefoot. That's why he's a master maybe. Yeah. Wow. Was that the 10,000 hours thing? You know, it's got a lot of years of choking people and thinking about it too, but the. He's always barefoot like so. There's probably something to that and he lifts weights, will converse all stars of the gym. They don't let you lift weights at a gym gym most of the time, barefoot, but those toe shoes didn't. Wasn't really a class action lawsuit that said those toe shoes were bullshit.

Speaker 2:          00:39:36       No. The class action lawsuit was that the woman who brought about the class action said that the advertising imply that all you had to do was buy the shoes that you didn't. You didn't have to figure out how to use your body differently, so it had nothing to do with how they. How they performed it was about their, their claim, so the way she interpreted it was that she just had to put them on her feet and that she would be healthier and have less injuries. Marika, let's

Speaker 5:          00:40:04       mark. Yeah, Jesus Christ. These class action lawsuits, some of them are just so God damn goofy. You let go. Come on. Really. You thought you could put shoes on and you would become a super person. Might have. It's true though, but that's the real issue. If they do one day come up with something that you just put it on and makes you a way better athlete. Like then what's the point of being? Yeah, it's like steroid shoes, you know, like all of a sudden people are running faster. She didn't that um, the, the South African guy who shot his girlfriend the, what's his name? The guy with the blades. Pistorius. Yeah. That guy. Those blades, like a lot of people feel like they can, you can actually run faster with those things on because they offer some sort of a spring that you could with just your regular feet.

Speaker 5:          00:40:52       So they get to that with shoes. Then we've got an issue. People, do you think people will be taking their own feet off just to get those too? When we've actually discussed that, what we've discussed is not for those blades, but there's gonna come a time where there was a guy that we, um, we talked about on the podcast once he had gotten his leg and his arm bitten off by a shark and he had replaced them with these really high tech replacement hands that articulate and his, his leg was perfectly suited to his body and he walked around with no limp. It was so strange and you see the guys there talking and he's having a conversation and talking about that and he's using his, his, his artificial hand and his real to gesture and like, well, what, what they're going to get better at those.

Speaker 5:          00:41:38       Like the old days it was like I went to school with this girl and she lost her arm like really early on in life. And it was always, you know, everybody was always weirded out by it. She had a hook. It's a very nice girl, but she was like, if she had like this artificial hand that looked exactly like a real hand is just a different color. Well, what, how much different would people react to her then a decade later if she has an artificial hand that has some sort of an artificial skin component to it that actually has sensitivity built into it, that it interacts with her nerves that allows. I mean, they have some that allow you to pick up pieces of glass and not break them. I mean they have like, really? They, they allow you to feel pressure, like really sensitive one. So they're developing one day they're going to get one that's better than your actual legs.

Speaker 5:          00:42:23       So if you had these regular legs, we can give you an operation and uh, it'll make you run like Hussein bolt. You're going to have some artificial legs, you know, it's going to, going to go through a rehab process. You won't be able to walk for a couple of weeks because we're going to cut your fucking legs off and stuff. These carbon fiber jammies in there and and put the joint endings in and fuse them with this new thing that we've created. Yeah, someone's going to do that. Totally. Absolutely. It's just a matter of time. Just a matter of time before we have artificial bodies into someone's going to just suck your head right out of your brain, right out of your head and stuffing into this thing and boom, you're just going to be like piloting around this crazy body right now. You think.

Speaker 2:          00:43:01       I absolutely think that that's kind of beyond the point though, right? Until then we've got to deal with what we have. Well, yeah. Well I would say, I mean I'm, I'm a biomechanist, so a lot of the colleagues that I work with are in a orthopedic development and stuff that you're talking about, so it's kind of my, my territory just to see what people are coming up with, but the big thing that you can't really get around yet is that, that your, that your parts are doing other parts and just moving you around. That's always kind of the limitation of like if you, if you lose a part, you know that's, that's the loss and you can replace it, but to voluntarily take off healthy parts, those parts do things other than just be those parts. They're, they're participating in the system. It's like kind of the same thing, like you can't take an animal out of an ecosystem because the, all the other animals collapse without it because they're expanding out of control and something else is dying off. It's the, it's the same thing. The parts, the part has a role as a part, but it also has a role within the system and so that'll be the backfiring on that.

Speaker 5:          00:44:04       The balance though, just like putting an invasive species into an ecosystem, screws everything up. There's a balance.

Speaker 2:          00:44:10       There's a relationship between everything else. It took a really long time to establish and when you start messing around that around, you're playing clean up like the rest of your life.

Speaker 5:          00:44:19       Yeah. Now when you like, when you think about human movement, like what? Besides the shoes that you wear, what are the other big issues that people have and how

Speaker 6:          00:44:32       they, how they get through this life with their body?

Speaker 2:          00:44:35       Well, people don't walk enough like they're missing in. Like there's a whole group of people who don't eat any fat. A lot of people don't eat any fat as a whole category of a, a micronutrient and then they're slowly introducing it back in and they're like, I had all these health problems because I was missing I'm fat. Or maybe I didn't eat any protein or maybe I didn't eat any animal products. You know, like they've got these big voids in their diet and then there are diseases that show up when you have some, some void like vitamin C, no one even knew you needed vitamin C until you have this group of sailors, you know, in this case population that went without it. And it's like, well, they have that. They had adequate food so it's not calories they're missing. And it took 40 years before someone realize it.

Speaker 2:          00:45:21       The vitamin C it's APP. We've figured out that we can get them their connective tissue to stop bleeding profusely if we give them a oranges or lemons, and then it took another 60 or 70 years for someone to identify that as vitamin C. it's like it's essential. Your body can't live without it, and so, so walking is really one of those things that your body can't. They can't function as it as it should without it that, that there are these other byproducts that go along when you walk in a particular way, so that's where alignment comes in, that there's this, these series of loads that are created by using your body and in walking would have been the thing that you would be doing most often out of out of all the moves that your body has done for the millennium, walking is the load maker that you would do the most and there's people who just don't walk at all. They work out, they're fit, they run, they do everything, but they don't walk. That's huge.

Speaker 6:          00:46:16       So just walking alone, just important just to to balance out your body, just to be a normal, healthy person.

Speaker 2:          00:46:23       Yeah. It's a, it's a, it's an input, it's an input to your, to your body slam. We don't think of movement as an input, but it's a squash, like your cells are squashed by the way that you move and then then the way that the cells expressed themselves, they're kind of, their genetic expression is, is comes about by the mechanical environment is one of the important environments. And, and right now for a lot of people it's walking free. So just walking, it doesn't really have any purpose in our life any longer because you don't, you don't have to walk anywhere to get anything done. But, but like this Orca Fin, you know, the way, the way that an Orca swims in the wild is what maintains its structure. There's nothing that the Orca can do now with this flopped over fin. It can't, it can't do opposing fin curls.

Speaker 2:          00:47:08       It can't foam roller out the floppy side. The structure has been set by the fact that swims in a circle. So it softens all, all, uh, fins soften as the worker goes from it's juvenile through its teenager to adulthood. But coupled package with that is swimming in a particular way at depths where the forces are such that it maintains and shapes this structure, this end result that we call an Orca. So we're, we are swimming metaphorically, just counterclockwise all of the time. And so our structure, our definition of fit and healthy is like the peak of that. This orca with the flopped over fin, whatever. Get swimming in a circle at seaworld and you can see the vast difference between any possible swimming program he can be put on there compared to how he would swim in the ocean, getting food every day, which is like 100 miles of swimming every day. Fast sprints when they have to get something, you know, there's, there's mating their social time, there's all these things that go on in the wild that is the necessary input for being an Orca. And then you just say, well then what, what necessary inputs are we missing? Kind of is as humans because so much of our physiology depends on how we move and how we don't.

Speaker 6:          00:48:24       So, uh, to use an analogy that you used earlier, like the Orca in that pool is kind of in a cast, correct? Because the atrophy of lawyer, I had my arm broke once and I had a cast when I took my arm out of the cast, it was like this little shriveled up thing, you know, and everybody knows that when you don't use your muscles, they just decide, oh, we don't need these and they shrink down. And so that's what's happening to this, this poor things thin

Speaker 2:          00:48:48       and, and everyone that, you know, even even people that you know who have a ton of muscle mass, it's just compare the distribution of muscle mass that you see is just compared to people who don't do those particular things that you do to get that muscle mass. But there is a whole other mass distribution that would come about were you to do other things. And so I'm, I'm mostly concerned with disease. What I, what I work on most are human diseases and, and basic human functions. What I'm most interested in is, um, she'll like, uh, getting pregnant, maintaining your delivery and then delivering this child like that. We're having some serious fertility and delivery problems, which are, you know, like the level one for a species, like the survival of a species is like, what do you mean people can't get pregnant or they can't birth third children anymore. Like they need special equipment and medical intervention. Like these are big signs for a species that it. Same thing happens in zoos, right? Like animals don't breed well in zoos because they are missing things. And so it's the same thing that we're experienced.

Speaker 6:          00:49:50       That's an interesting way of putting it. Animals don't breed well in zoos because they're missing. Their environment has been radically changed. And that's the same thing with people.

Speaker 2:          00:50:00       Well, they're supposed to be interacting with other animals. I mean like there's so much. There's isolation, not, not just the animal itself from its herd or it's try, but then from other animals. Again, this is a big system and in zoo research is really interesting because it's covering everything. Like what happens when you put a zoo in a city, you know, and, and, and have light, you've got light going on all of the time. So, um, there's, there's constant what they call night lighting, so light beyond this, the sun. And then there's metal noises, the loud clanging. Plus there's all these biological cues that if you ever go camping, you know, you hear the bugs, the bugs let you know the birds let you know where everything else is in that there are cultures who understand who, who have this input of, of noise. And from a scientific perspective, you know, there's like these things.

Speaker 2:          00:50:53       All of the data that we have on humans really comes from the last, oh, maybe like 60 to 100 years. And so there's like these basic in psychology tests, like you've probably seen them where they've got the arrows, the outset arrows pointed outward on the tips. And then on the other tip of the other early point in words, which line is longer, it's kind of an optical illusion and you get it wrong. Like everyone says that the arrows that point in his longer or whatever, and it was like, so this is how the human brain works and there's all this data like that. Only it turns out if you take that test to a culture that actually needs to judge distance for survival, they don't have a problem seeing. It's not an optical illusion to them. It's just poor skill when we look at it.

Speaker 2:          00:51:34       So there are all of these hypotheses on humans are studying college aged humans like you're. You're looking at orcas with floppy, floppy fins and then are just making all these judgments on whales and so I'm at with this realization that so much of our, like your human physiology textbook, that's not human physiology, that shape that you're looking at have a skeleton that's, that's modern guy who's worn shoes his whole life and walked on flat and level, flat and level ground. That's another cast. You're not supposed to walk like flat and level is the most weird abnormal texture for you to ever walk on, and yet you've probably only walked on flat and level for like 99 percent of your life. Your ankle joint has a different shape than someone who has walked in the wilderness their whole entire life because they use more parts just to get walking done. Use almost nothing to walk. Walking is falling. Like that's our. That's our saying is sure. For someone who sits in the chair most of the time and walks on flat and level in shoes that's falling. Some people have an incredibly difficult time going up hills. Sure. The different muscles and different.

Speaker 5:          00:52:41       One of the first times I went hunting, I went hunting in Montana and we were climbing up these hills. That's used to be the great western inland sea near, uh, it's the Missouri breaks. And so it's this weird clay like material that covers all the ground and when you're walking up hill you're sliding a lot down and everything is kind of slippery. So everywhere you're going, you're constantly counterbalancing and catching yourself. And it's not like us and you get exhausted like you think you're in shape. Like you could do all kinds of crazy workouts and crossfit your brains out, but then you go up these hills all day and you're fucking tired and by the end of the day you're starving. You have this weird hunger for animal protein to for animal protein and fat, like fatty things and even pasta or any like high calorie things like this intense craving for because your body's just doing all this breaking down of tissue all day long. You're stressing your body in a weird way that you just don't get. Like walking around the city

Speaker 2:          00:53:43       we've gotten. We've gotten rid of everything. Anything. The only variable that we have left to play with his intensity. Like it's like, well I'm walking on this. I'll have to go faster. I'll have to go harder because that's the only thing that's left to respond to it. Like that's the thing with casts is if you've. If you've removed any other movement that would allow you to do any sort of cross training or use new parts in different ways than all you have left to do is the same thing harder or faster, but yeah, texture for people who study the human kinetic chain, like things like walking and like the foot skin like you're going up hills and shoes probably, but if you. If you didn't have shoes on, that first level of of traction would be at the skin, which means your skin has to be strong enough to carry the load of your body here hands, you know, people do a ton of work with their upper body, but they won't actually bring the hand skin along to the strength of the rest of their body because everything's a bar, right? It's like this flat uniform level never occur in nature bar as opposed to picking up things with texture and each other's texture. That kind of bite in the skin and then your skin strengthens and then your arms are stronger because. Because that first level of caring or picking up or hauling out or doing anything is traction. Traction between you and the earth, human and the earth. Animal on earth, whether it's a hand or foot.

Speaker 5:          00:55:04       Yeah. One thing I've never understood is I understand it, but I've never done it. I've never agreed with it is guys who put risk traps on and do all these exercises. So you're carrying weight that your hands can support, but you're kind of doing your body a disservice or you're overloading your joint 20 doing that, aren't you?

Speaker 2:          00:55:21       Yeah. Um, because what's happening is they can't get any stronger to carry that because it's, again, it's this limited flat and round thing like, you know, you can pick up your kettlebell or whatever, but as it's getting heavier, it's the same handle. So there's, there's parts of you that are left out of getting stronger because the environment is repetitive. So if you go out and hang from a tree, if you were holding onto something that kind of fit in a little bit, then you would be able to carry with your hands whatever you were also able to carry with for the rest of the body. There's got to be some sort of cross training for the hands. It can't just be that same

Speaker 5:          00:55:59       thanks. So instead of just gripping like this all the time, you should do some stuff like this and you should pull things and you should be.

Speaker 2:          00:56:06       And texture. Texture is, it's not musculoskeletal, it has nothing to do with the amount your joints flex, so. So girth of a bar is one thing, you know, the size and the shape of the bar and the angle. That's one way of cross training the hands, but there's also the skin, like your skin just not

Speaker 4:          00:56:23       strong enough because the things that you are exercising with are these kind of smooth man made fake things are not anything that you would actually like. This is the weight of a log. It's like great. Go pick up a log to. We should pick up long. You should pick up logs, pickup some, some rocks or something. Or at least hall yourself up in a tree. Every now and then instead of on a chin up bar, like in a gym.

Speaker 5:          00:56:44       Hm. We need trees to climb up, but if you fall down from the tree, you're fucked.

Speaker 4:          00:56:49       Yeah. Or are you. I don't know, maybe you've never really loaded. Like I said, the other thing would walls you're fucked if you fall from a tree. Well, the same thing about, you know, dropping something on your foot. You become a little bit more mindful. You become more mindful.

Speaker 5:          00:57:03       My friend Cameron does this work out. I think he does it once a week where he takes a rock that's 135 pound rock and he carries it up to the top of a mountain and he doesn't want it two ways. Like sometimes he throws it in his backpack. He has like one of those, a big oversized tenzing backpacks, like with all the straps on it that you would use for like carrying game out of the woods. He's a big l connor. And to train his body to carry heavy loads, he just takes us 135 pound rock throws in his backpack and goes up hills or sometimes he just picks this rock up and puts it on his shoulder and goes up hills and just rotate shoulders and I think in his eyes like anything you do that's unusual or difficult and training your body and training it in some way that's going to sort of mimic what he's going to have to do if he's hunting and carrying an elk out of the forest. It's like similar to that. Yeah,

Speaker 4:          00:57:55       six law of specificity. You want to get to it as close as possible,

Speaker 5:          00:57:59       but he's also still carrying this awkward weight and doing things in a way that makes you your body like compensate.

Speaker 4:          00:58:06       But that's. But see, that's the thing with posture, why it's a modern construct. Like to say that there's a safe way to carry a rock really means that if I'm only doing this one thing and then sitting down the rest of the time, that the only way that my whole body's going to be trained is if I do my training time symmetrically. If you were just moving all the time, kind of a nature, you would balance out and actually. Because you'd never encouraged. You never encounter the same load twice really. So I have kids, I have a two year old and a three old. We've never had a stroller. We've carried those 30 and 40 pounders exclusively miles. And so that was, that was our big thing. Right. You know, so everyone's like, you're, when you have kids, a lot of times your workout changes because there's just no more time anymore.

Speaker 4:          00:58:50       It's like, well you carry them and then they're dynamic and they're moving, which means it's not like it's not holding a 30 or 40 pound ball, right. It's, it's a different load because there for 30 and 40 pounds is distributed at their whim based on what they want to look at and where they want to go and they want to go to this site now. So they are, they are strong little shits, like they're strong, they're really strong, but they've been carrying themselves and we've been carrying them. So it's like there's been this relationship, I'm always strong enough to carry them five miles. No problem.

Speaker 3:          00:59:24       Wow. Five miles, five miles. Wow.

Speaker 4:          00:59:31       That's very impressive. Carrying anything that's 30 plus pounds, five miles, but you can't put down when you're like, that's the thing. It's like we've committed, we're in the, we're in the wilderness. We will have to come out now. Like my six year old is awesome. She pulls full guard on your show, wrap her legs around you and essentially almost carries her homework and that's part of it. Right? So since they've never been in a stroller, they know how to hold on to and they could hold on. I mean when they were like six or seven months, they were strong enough to hold on. It could hang from their own hand. Wait, no problem. That you had to give them the environment to do that, which was never put him in anything. That's so, so you like have engineered this in a way? Well I think it was, it's been around for a really long time.

Speaker 4:          01:00:12       But yeah, like that's like in your own personal. My own personal life. I've just a really do everything that I recommend. I've just done myself. I do it as a workout. I carry both of them. Like when we go places and they get tired. I carry both my kids a six year old and the four year old I always team up. I have an 18 year old but I'm carrying a six year old, the four year old or hoist him up on my shoulders and haul them around. But yeah, this is a really good workout if you, you know, you carry carrying 70 pounds and some sort of a weird way, you know, you got like 40 on one hand, 30 on the other and you sort of balance and amount, but it balances out over time. I mean, I guess that's a thing with, with loads the body, they should balance out over time. They don't always have to balance out over an hour.

Speaker 3:          01:00:53       I found out something recently that disturbed me. I always throw my backpack, I throw it over my right shoulder like this and I walk around and it just sits there. But then when I throw it over my left shoulder it slumps down and it's awkward. Like I can't carry it on my skin right now. But you know, like my left shoulder doesn't know how to keep it up. And I was like, well what the fuck is going on? Why does it keep doing this? Why does it keep falling over my left one when I put on my right one, boom, it just locks in place there. It's effortless, but over my left one it's like a lot of extra work. So I started carrying it only on my left one, like, you know, pick up the slack bitch. But it's odd, like I think I'm in balanced in some sort of strange way.

Speaker 4:          01:01:38       Yeah. Well, you know, the shape of your body is down on the, on the cellular level, you know, they look at bones and people they can tell who his right hand and you'll be able to tell you right handed or left handed. That's how all that anthropological data just. Yeah, it's bone robust tenicity the size and the shape of your bone lets people know what you did with your body while you were here.

Speaker 3:          01:01:58       Well that's also why bounce in like certain exercises like pictures and stuff. They get imbalanced because they're always throwing with your right hand. Like my friend Steve Maxwell, he's worked with a lot of people that have issues with their back and stuff and like one of them was a kicker and he fixed it all by making them kick with the left leg. It was like, you're own kicking with your right leg all the time. Do you ever kick with your left leg? Then I was like, no. Like

Speaker 5:          01:02:20       you need to do that. Like you're, you're, you're loading up one side of your body constantly all day and the other side is getting virtually no movement in the same direction. So it's just going to have to start doing. And all of his problems went away.

Speaker 2:          01:02:34       Yeah. You can't just do heavy, high loads on one side all day long. Is your sport like that can't be your sport. It has to a little bit better balanced.

Speaker 5:          01:02:43       But isn't that incredible? Because I don't think pitchers, I don't, I really don't know what they do about that now. I think it's probably more people like you now that are interacting with these guys and teaching them things. But I think for the most part they just throw the one arm

Speaker 2:          01:02:55       they do. And the thing with the thing, with the picture data, like in the CTCS, um, it's not just muscle, like it's easy to correct a muscle imbalance. It's like, Oh, you clearly, you can see that there's more muscle mass on one side. Their bone, the bone itself is torked now. So that the reason that you know if you have enough, if you wind up, if you imagine winding up, there's this great need for range of motion behind you and your body is very efficient. If you are going to keep challenging the muscles to get longer, to stretch to that position, it will just move the bone there so that the muscles can go back to kind of their regular length. So now you have the same range of motion in both arms, but the range of motion isn't a different location on your pitching arm because you've twisted the bone there.

Speaker 2:          01:03:41       So that phenomenon of, of your bones being shaped by what you do is happening to all of us all the time. People will say like, have tibial torsion, you know, like in my lower leg. It's like, yes, your gait pattern has slowly wound your bones so that your foot is no longer in the same plane as it once was or would have been. So you already are an entirely different shape than you would have been had you been moving differently throughout your life. You're, you're, you're not just like more or less muscle in shape or out of shape. You're an entirely different shape.

Speaker 5:          01:04:13       Whoa. So, um, I started doing martial arts when I was a young boy and did it all throughout my adolescent years through puberty. That's probably my body sort of developed to do those movements. That's one of the reasons why when you take people, one of the big issues with a martial arts, some martial arts that have really difficult for older people to learn and kicking seems to be one of the hardest ones. For whatever reason your body just does not want to learn that as an older person. But as a young person, like my six year old, her little hips are just so, like loose. She knows she can just throw her legs around. There's no resistance, but old people, it's very difficult getting into properly with enough speed and, and to, to have impact. But if you get someone that's the same age has been doing it since there were child there could do it really quickly. It's was like there's something about the body developing, doing those movements.

Speaker 2:          01:05:11       Yeah. You know, zero to zero to five is the most where you're the most malleable, like your skeleton isn't

Speaker 4:          01:05:18       even set yet, but then when you go from five to 15 and probably all the way up to 20, then you are much more malleable than you will be after your. Your bone, your bone. We say bone density because it's easiest to measure, but your bone shape and all that entails is set really for life at that point. So you know if you would squat, so you probably squat a lot more. At least if you're in a martial art, a lot of times they're squatting put into it, but if you take someone who's been sitting at their office, you know, using a toilet their whole entire life, their hips have never articulated to that degree that you're, that you're asking them to. And in the tradition of the martial art that people who came up with the martial art oftentimes live in entirely different lifestyle.

Speaker 4:          01:06:01       Where they're shaped. They're. There are shapes that facilitate sports better and the in the shape that facilitates. It tends to come from the areas that create whatever the sport is that you're talking about because anthropometric dimensions are the size and the shape of your body. Sports and leverages that you create are heavily dependent on anther prometric dimensions and so your pelvis you might not be able to kick because your pelvis is shaped by not kicking like you have a not kicking pelvis because you were a non kicker. You can't just all of a sudden start to be a kicker any any more than the pitcher can decide to not have it twisted bone in his arm anymore after throwing his whole entire life.

Speaker 6:          01:06:39       So if you develop your whole life as a non kick and then someone tries to show you kicking techniques, is there. Is there a way to open you up and make you more pliable and make your body adapt to those movements better?

Speaker 4:          01:06:51       I think that there is because you are malleable really as a structure throughout your entire life. I just think that it's larger than do this kick over and over and over again, that there are ways to facilitate the mobility of the entire structure. So if it were me and I was trying to teach them martial art, it wouldn't just be the kick. I'd be like, what? What do these that are good at kicking? Like what are the other lifestyle things? It's, it's about frequency. It's not enough. It's not enough load like not kicking. You're constantly adapting to not kicking. So the amount that you kick is, I mean how many kicks are you going to practice 100. 100. Like it's so it's so it's so it's too small. It's so small. What you're asking to adapt to that. There are ways to create change in shape and bones and that there's evidence that it really does happen throughout a lifetime. It's just the exercise paradigm is so small to training paradigm is so small. It's like if you want to become more malleable, you have to change everything that you do all of the time and you will adapt to that.

Speaker 6:          01:07:48       Do people have a built in limitation as far as their flexibility or is it simply a matter of the amount of time and effort you spend trying to explain? You expand your flexibility?

Speaker 4:          01:08:01       I don't think humans have a builtin limitation from birth, but I think that your range of motion gets set really, really early and we are in a mobilizing culture like we a mobilizer. Babies really like the whole culture really doesn't work unless your kids are quiet and still in someplace at the time in which are the most dynamic and I'm now people now, you know, we used to roll around in the back of our station wagon, but now kids are like locked in even more for a longer period of time and they have more casts on them now so they're very, very inflexible. Extremely inflexible or the ranges of motion are in way different planes than they would be. So like you can still have 50 degrees of hip motion, but it's all in front of you instead of port of it being behind you.

Speaker 5:          01:08:52       Right? Yeah. That's one of the weird ones I'm in teaching is teaching people to lift their leg up and to move it. Like in this range, like whether it's a cross or this one is even weirder. Lifting your leg up, what's called a hook kick. You lift your leg up and bring it across. This way it's just a different movement and a looseness of the hips and I've talked to people about it and one of the big copout as people go, I'm not naturally flexible. You're naturally flexible and I'm like, man, I don't know about all that. I don't seem naturally flexible. I see my mom, I see my sister like they're not. They're not any but I've done it my whole life so I. I've become. But there was this guy that used to work out at our gym and he was a really, like I'm very dedicated athletes, a pro football player who retired and started getting into Jujitsu and he had massive flexibility issues for a while, but this guy was such a dedicated athlete that he would get after practice, he would, he would do his training and then he would stretch just like painful stretches.

Speaker 5:          01:09:54       You could see that guy putting way more time in it and then like a year later he's doing the splits and you know, I pointed it out to everybody in the class. I go, I don't want to hear anybody tell me you can't get flexible because this fucking guy got flexible in a year, like in a year, this guy was this giant, 250 pound like giant quads, like all stiff from all these years of dead lifting and all that jazz and this guy figured out like, hey, in order to get good at Jujitsu, I'm going to have to really stretch, and we all used him as an example. Okay, now I know like it, it can be done, but you got to really do it and you've got to do it. It's gonna. It's gonna suck and it's not going to feel comfortable. It's gonna. You're gonna have to stretch that tissue out.

Speaker 4:          01:10:33       Yeah, it's frequency. I mean, I think the easiest way to say is it's all changeable, but you have to be super diligent. It's about the amount of time that you're asking your body to do something and if you imagine the shape of whatever kick you can do now, like whatever small circle it is, and then you imagine this, the kick that you want to have your kicks just have to. You have to coax the edge of it. It's like you're. Your body's like clay, right? You're just a matter of you're just doing the slow reshaping, your slowly reshaping and and you want to just be imagining the shape that you're trying to make and you're just pushing the limits of the tissue because you, you've been doing it so long, you have the parts. Your muscle mass becomes longer, shorter as necessary.

Speaker 6:          01:11:14       The, the orientation of the bone in its socket and all those support issues like those, it takes a while to adapt. Takes a year. It's not like I've been doing this for six weeks. When is it going to get better? It's like you're not doing it for 40 years, so you just have to look about. You have to look at it more in terms of time, like realistic time and physiology, and I think anyone can really accomplish some serious physical, physiological, physical transformations, but again, not in that one hour that they allow themselves three times a week. It's got to be bigger. Everybody wants a pill. Sure, fucking Dr. every time you seen him on TV, he's pushing some God damn diet pill. They dragged him in front of Congress because of that shit. He was lying about Miracle Diet pills, but that's a real issue with our culture is we want to.

Speaker 6:          01:11:58       We want to eat things to lose weight. We want to put more food in our fat faces and we just want, oh, this, this diet is going to make you lose weight, but what what you're doing by telling people that that you can have a pill and lose weight is you're, you're. What you're doing is denying the reality of change and that change requires time and effort and you can't just pop something in there and get a shot and everything goes away and all your fat shrinks away. And like, people that want to like, there's this friend, um, she uh, got liposuction and didn't need it. I mean she might've been 20 pounds overweight. Like maybe if that, like that's a few months of dedication. That's it. Just a few months of let's watch our diet, let's you know, and you know, she's got kids and Blah Blah Blah and she, you know, has a business and blah blah blah.

Speaker 6:          01:12:53       She just doesn't have that much time. But you gotTa fucking vacuum stuffed under your skin and they sucked all the fat out and now you've got to wear a girdle and they going to wear these compression shorts and shit. And everything's all fucked up and lumpy and like it's crazy. Oozing postures, a drain on her leg because the, the, the fact that they suck out of it, like everything gets infected and it's all fucking pussy and shit. Like you're going to go through two months of rehabilitation, you're going to recover. It's going to take you like, yeah, you look slightly thinner right away, but at what cost. But the instantaneous nature of the gratification of just going to the doctor or are going to suck it all out. Right? Like the same thing as the doctor telling me, Oh, you're going to, we're going to have to fuse her desk.

Speaker 6:          01:13:38       Like you're going to what? Like wait a minute, I'm moving around. Everything seems to be. There's no way to fix this. It's just going to get worse. Like they always say, it's just gonna get worse. Well, if I continue to do the same shit that made it bad, it's just going to get worse. Right? Isn't there some sort of a way to change that? But nobody thinks about it that way. Everybody wants instantaneous gratification where there's a weird space right now where we want, we want to be better in the very same habit, doing the same things that got us to where we are in the first place. Like it's

Speaker 4:          01:14:12       so weird. It's like when does that work? Anywhere else where like this is, this is what has happened, this is the, this is the ramifications of all those things that you did. So the solution, the pill is really so that I don't have to change any of those things that got me there. It's like everyone should take a class in human physiology or something.

Speaker 5:          01:14:31       Well, there's also the reality of life. Dove work, you know, most people have a job that requires them to stay in a spot and it's really difficult to do anything about it. I have this Jarvis desks, not this one, but uh, over there and the other room that uh, Jamie setup, you press a button and it stands with you. So like as you were at your office, you can do this and you can just go back and sit down and you move around. The idea is to give yourself like a couple of minutes sitting a couple minutes standing and keep moving like Zach,

Speaker 4:          01:15:00       is that effective? That's good. Amazing. So there's like a whole, if you just talk about your office, I'm not, I like the standing workstation, right? So the sitting kills stuff sitting's worse than smoking. Then everyone's like, I'm never gonna sit down ever worse. Right. I don't know if you chain smoke. Well, have you been changed sitting for a long time? What'd you chain smoke end chain set than your far. Well maybe it's smoking has been saving your life by going outside for a smoke break. So small walks, you know now like the literature is like make sure you take a small walk every 20 minutes like that times perfectly with a cigarette break. And since it's not since it's the old smoking, so old smoking. But could you imagine

Speaker 5:          01:15:37       someone telling you, uh, you know, I'll, I'll work in your office by gotta to take a walk every 20 minutes like fuck off. You're not going to get anything done.

Speaker 4:          01:15:44       Well I, you know what I tell people all the time that they should do their phone calls, walking, like, like make your, save up your phone calls and then just go out and just take a 20 minute stroll or whatever. And just gotTa stop right here. Because I don't have service for. Keep walking. Yeah. See I live in the cities all different now. I don't know where these things. What will you, where you live and you get cell phone service. I do everywhere I cell phone service now. We have in China right everywhere. Even that can be good. Has that bad, bad for bees, cell phone service. You know what, that whole emf thing, they wanted to put some emf weapons up in an hour in our woods there so that it's like we've, there's no literature that shows that they're bad for the body. So we're going to put some emf weapons and was like, what?

Speaker 4:          01:16:31       That's crazy. Yeah, I've seen some interesting studies. Clearly it's doing something so the, the easiest tissue to test his sperm because you can get as much sperm to test and you can, you can. It's a ethical I guess to expose it to emf so they can take, you know, just gonna throw it away anyway, so you can take us to sperm samples and you can put one next to a phone or you can have a guy where a phone on his hip and the sperm is different after having it. So they don't know if it's the heat of the device because there's a device in your pocket, you know, a lot of people carry it right there in their pocket or right there in their shirt pockets, you know, um, whether it's the heat or the EMF, they haven't really broken it down. And I've seen some, some other smaller studies on, on um, uh, fetuses, you know, where they make the mother have a device and where a device to see what the cells look like.

Speaker 4:          01:17:27       So the data isn't, the data is pointing that there is some sort of change all with all that kind of stuff. It's like the dose makes the poison. How much, what is the change significant. Like what's gonna happen with that sperm that's different. Nobody knows any of that. So I guess just say, just say, well, use your phone. I turn my phone off of air. I put it on airplane mode if it's going to be by my head when I go to sleep. And other than that, I don't keep it on my body or near my body. Why do you keep it by your head? Well yeah, like if it's, if it's my alarm or whatever, so I was like, you can use it for an alarm, just turn, you can turn it off. So that's not transmitted admitting anything. Right. But is it's still generating heat? Well it's not touching me anymore so it's not all my skin. But if you carry it in your pocket, if you're carrying in your pocket, it would still be. It generates heat more I think when it's transmitting

Speaker 5:          01:18:15       wonder if people just show up like years now everyone has asked cancer

Speaker 4:          01:18:18       back pocket area ships are all aligned but now they have asked answer.

Speaker 5:          01:18:24       I think like Sheryl Crow has brain cancer and she was saying that they were trying to attribute it to or possibly attributed to when she was doing press for her first cd was the old days of cell phones and she did all of it through her mobile phone. She had it up to her head the entire time and it's that side of her head that she has the issue with.

Speaker 4:          01:18:47       I think that we, we do a lot of stuff that we have no idea how it's gonna, you know, trickle down later

Speaker 5:          01:18:54       about it. Like everywhere we go, you're experiencing wifi signals, radio signals, um, you know, I don't know. How does the satellite thing work? I mean you have to Kinda like have a, an antenna or a dish that points up to where the satellite is sending the signal, but that signal somehow or another getting here, whether it hits your dish or not, is it getting to bodies? We know that cell phone signals fuck with bees. Like that's one of the things that they've figured out when they were trying to figure out what's killing off all these honeybees. Most, most things point towards pesticides, but there is an disease, but there's also some issue that we might be constantly fucking with their navigation and their ability to communicate. It's almost like living next door to people that are just playing loud rock music all day. Do you survive? Yes you do. But does it fuck with the quality of your life? Yeah, it does. You know, and because bees have this weird way of communicating with each other that seems to be interfering or with the cellular systems that we have seems to be interfering with that.

Speaker 4:          01:20:00       Well, and they've shown it was sonar and the whales, you know, everything is just messed up by these things, these, that we're creating

Speaker 2:          01:20:08       for whatever, you know, they're, they're tangible, they're invisible. I think it's just because they're invisible. We just don't think of visible things having any sort of impacts like wrap me up in something I want to head pounding against my head. But if I can't see it, how much could it really be harming me. Meanwhile, every everyone's writing up this huge list of things that are wrong with them and what they're searching for and we're just flapping on uh, well it's just idiopathic or genetic or, or whatever has no cause no known cause it just happens. It's normal. And it's like, yeah, but. So our cell phone towers or chairs and all this other stuff.

Speaker 3:          01:20:41       Well, there's a weird feeling that you get when you get to a completely deserted place, like a real wilderness place with total quiet, no cell phone service, no nothing. Yeah. This is weird. Like absence of input that you feel different. They're like, wow, this feels weird. Like I gotta get Outta here. Desolate feels like so it's so unforgiving. It just doesn't give a fuck if you're around or not around. It's like that silence for whatever. It's almost like people that are afraid to be alone, like you have to be out at parties all the time. It got to constantly be talking to people on the phone when you're alone and you have to deal with your own bullshit. When you go to those will true wilderness areas with no cell phone service. It's like, oh, okay. A little scary. This is real. You know, we try to go dark like two days a week. Dark, dark wood in the diamond family.

Speaker 2:          01:21:33       Yes. The Bowman Bowman family goes dark two days a week and you just go out and spend more time outside than inside and that's a great place about having great thing about having the wilderness. There is like huge trees, old growth trees have been around for a long time and one time it was windy and trees were falling

Speaker 3:          01:21:50       down. It's like trees are falling down. We are in the wilderness. It's insane. Well, it happens. It happens. Yeah. You say that until you get hit by a tree that I've avoided that. You don't have that laissez faire, but it happens. It happens. Maybe A. Yeah. Yeah. Fucking hit by an old growth tree. Way to go. We, we were out in one fell and it sounded like a gunshot went off and we had determined that it was a tree that fell who was up in Canada, but it was like boom. We're like somebody out here shooting. Like what the fuck is that? And the guy that we were with, like I don't think so. I think that's a tree with a felling trees or no towel. Just fucking had its time. What happens when was blown like, that's enough. I'm tapping out bone and it just came down. I mean, you find them all over the place, right? There are so many trees, but that reality that this, this thing has been there before Columbus ever get near America. I mean especially where you are in the Pacific northwest when you're dealing with some of those trees, like a thousand years old,

Speaker 2:          01:22:56       almost the whole planet used to be wooded, right? We've cut everything down. It was almost all wooded. You couldn't even. You couldn't even walk. I'm like up in up in British Columbia, up there, I was so thick. The all of the trees falling down for years. All that Moss and stuff that you're walking on is just old mushed up, rotted trees, but you couldn't even just walk through the woods. There are trees everywhere and they've cut everything down and so much of the desert that's in the middle of the United States or from those from the fires, like when they started using lumber for oceans, ocean ships like all of the. The British military ships came from lumber from the Pacific northwest, and they are at, once they realized that they had that commodity they are using like wasn't mink Mikan Otter, otter offers where what brought everyone to the Pacific northwest.

Speaker 2:          01:23:45       They cleaned all the mountain and like what can we ship now if they would, and then they shipped it out and they were making, they were milling it. So when you mill it, you know, the mass of the tree is lost in between the boards. So it's um, a sawdust and so sawdust was clogging all the rivers and there was a big fire and then the fire just went across the United States because there was no natural water barriers anymore. It just burnt it down, kind of like your cartilage, right? You can, you can use some cartilage grows back, but if you take it all the way down to the bottom to the base cells,

Speaker 5:          01:24:18       no more's coming back. So that's really where that, that rock, it's really cool. Have you ever used a pellet grill? You don't. A pellet grill and this is company. A bunch of companies make them, but one of them that I'm friends with, his green mountain grills and these pellet grills, they take hardwood pellets and it's basically saw dust and they press it in the natural sugars. Allow it to maintain the shape of. It's almost like kitty litter. If you have a cat. I have a cat. We use this pine. Literally it looks real similar to the stuff that you put it in this pellet grill. It's all digitally regulated so it can keep the temperature at 200 degrees. Can You keep it for like seven hours with this like pot of of pellets and it's like super efficient and it's a smoker. It's essentially a grill slash smoker, but instead of like, have you ever used an old school smoker?

Speaker 5:          01:25:08       Like one of those big barrel smokers, those are pain in the ass. Like you got to like regulate the openings, the valves and make sure you get the right amount of temperature. You've got to keep thermometers in there. And in the old days it was super difficult to figure out how hot everything was, you know? And then they figured out how to put meat thermometer is actually in the meet and have digital ones had come outside and give you a reading. But these pellet smokers essentially they take all that hardwood sawdust that used to be just waste and compress it into these little pellets and then use it to cook with smart. Yeah, it's pretty cool. And it tastes really good too when you cook it with because you were actually. It's real. It's not like that's the big issue with using any sort of lighter fluid or anything like those. Those ones that are like easy match, charcoal briquettes, those chemicals and those things. And you can taste it. You smell it. Yeah. But this stuff, you don't smell any of it. So they're there, you know. But it is, that's the reality of

Speaker 3:          01:26:04       chopping down trees just looks gross and it makes you feel sad when you see it. But your house is warm because he chopped down trees.

Speaker 4:          01:26:10       Yeah, it's, yeah, it's a cutting. It's sad to be up there and don't drive by a forest that's not there anymore.

Speaker 3:          01:26:19       Yeah, those cut blocks was gigantic chunks, but they kind of regulate that. Right. Like they only allow you to do it in certain spots. Then they regrow them and.

Speaker 4:          01:26:26       Well, but they're regrowing Americans. It's the same thing with any sort of management. Like they're being replanted with stuff. It's going to be cut down into different kinds of tree. It's like a non native kind of tree. It's the fast growing kind. Right. So I was trying to get it up and it's like a commodity, a commodity. So get it planted and get it back up so we can cut it down again. But that old wood, there's nothing like old growth. It's just been around forever.

Speaker 3:          01:26:51       Yeah. There's nothing like being in those forests to. Because you really do get that sense that while this was here long before the wheel or long before rather I'm the engine or long before boats came over here. I mean this stuff out before the wheel. Sixty zero, 6,000 year old trees, right? No. So I don't think so. What's the oldest tree? I don't know. Let's find out. What do you guess? If you had to guess, it'd be like a sequoia or a redwood or something. How old do you think it would be? There's trees. Whoa. Methuselah, a brittle cone. Pine tree from California's white mountains is thought to be 5,000 years old. The oldest non non conal will know what that means. Non clonal tree in the world. The exact location of the normal trusted is. Oh, it's kept secret for its protection. Huh? There's a tree that people are so gross. You have to not tell them where the old tree is because they'll go cut it down. Smoking chair out of the tree. Yeah. Some asshole will go and use it to make his headboard. That stupid tree. Huh? Five thousand years old. So that's a good answer. So that's a God damn old tree. That's probably the wheel.

Speaker 4:          01:28:06       And there's probably wheels circles all around it.

Speaker 3:          01:28:08       Yeah. Yeah. Um, but that's just being around something that predates most of human history. Just knowing that this thing was a seed and that seed became this tree and it's just seeing this entire world changed during the time that it's been living and breathing in carbon dioxide and breathing out oxygen. Very freaky. That's something you get with old growth trees that you're not going to get with those cut blocks that are reef refurbished with these new little shitty pine trees that are little tags on them and stuff. Yeah, it's kind of fucked. That's just a weird thing about people. We just, we, we, if we don't put regulations on stuff, that's why it's really cool. Like a place like a. have you ever been to boulder, Colorado? They don't really allow people to build like the. You don't see any apartment buildings in the mountains you don't see like they, they have a very strict amount

Speaker 5:          01:29:02       of construction that they allow in and they're very strict about it and they buy up space on people of like spaced land that's for sale. Like Boulder County will actually buy that land and make sure that it remains open space. So there'll be given ever build on it, be kind of have to do that. Keep people from fucking the whole thing up. You know, wonder why no one wants to go to Alaska.

Speaker 4:          01:29:26       I think the last frontier, there's some space up there. Yeah, with everyone's scared of bears. That's true. I'll ask. It's freaky. Alaska is the law. It's like the wild west. It is like the wild west up there.

Speaker 5:          01:29:36       The people are really cool though. Have you spent time in Alaska?

Speaker 4:          01:29:40       No. My husband had a big motorcycle trip. They did like a big motorcycle trip. I'm like all around there and they were just in some kind of back country and it was like everyone here, is this like hardy? They are. They are like the cowboy, whatever that equivalent spirit is there going there because there's this less rules, more space, more quiet.

Speaker 5:          01:29:59       We went to the movies at midnight and it was bright outside. This is fucking strange. It was in the middle of July. It was really weird. Like we, we did a comedy show up there. We got out of the show. It was two, 3:00 in the morning. Bright out, see everything. It's very strange and the people up there there are so it's like there's a as a sense of community, even in the city like anchorage that you don't really see in a lot of cities down here because their reality is, yeah, well every now and then a moose comes into town and kicks the shit out of some people at a supermarket or a bear attack. Someone that's in the wrong place, the wrong time or you know, it's just the reality that they live in. They all have to kind of band together because every now and then if you see a car broken down the side of the road, like you get out and help that person because that could be you. Right? Whereas if you're leaving here and you get on the one on one, you see some guy broken down, you don't even think for a second, let me pull over. There's 100 million people drive by. Wrong. No one's thinking, let me go help that guy. But if you're in Alaska and that's the only car you've seen for 20 minutes, you pull over. Hey you okay? Like what's going on? Like you need a call, it's a. there's a sense of community because of their harsh conditions because the environment they're in.

Speaker 4:          01:31:12       Yeah, you need people. You really do need a tribal situation. If you have, you're spread out a little bit, you know you have your, your claim or your space, but when you need help it's going to have to be some other person's gonna have to come help

Speaker 5:          01:31:28       but don't think it's kind of healthier to be in a place where there's like, you know, the term diffusion of responsibility, the idea being that it's easier to attack someone in front of a thousand people than it is in front of one person because one person feels obligated to help. Whereas a thousand people say someone should jump in and do something but nobody does anything because they don't feel like they have to because there's so many other folks. Isn't that Kinda like what you get if you're in a big city as opposed to like maybe where you live or maybe Alaska or just a. there's a, there's a number

Speaker 3:          01:32:00       that's manageable.

Speaker 4:          01:32:02       Yeah, I mean I, I like, I like the town that we live in. I grew up in a small town and then I've been, I was in southern California for a long time and it never really felt connected as easiest word, but now that I'm out there in a little bit more rugged or wilderness, you know, I, I, I, I feel I feel safe, safe knowing that there are neighbors or community members, I feel more, more safe there. I think that I feel in the big city.

Speaker 3:          01:32:33       Yeah, totally makes sense. Uh, yeah. I think big cities are a new thing, you know, as far as human beings, like our DNA, we've only had them for a few hundred years.

Speaker 4:          01:32:43       Yeah. What's the biggest city?

Speaker 3:          01:32:45       It's probably something in China, like as far as population wise, I mean la is kind of huge, but it's really spread out. It's not. I mean it's a city, but it's a weird thing. It's like a giant suburb, you know, the look at the city aspect of La you got like downtown La is what we think of as a city, but because of the fact that there's earthquakes, everything is only one level out here are two levels at most except for downtown and you have a few office buildings here and there, but if you look at the landscape, it's a lot of like flat things. I would say probably the biggest is like Singapore or something like that. What is it?

Speaker 4:          01:33:21       Hong Delhi. India has got at least 25 million. Do you know your neighbors really well? My neighbor is a Douche bag. So you do.

Speaker 3:          01:33:32       I know one neighbor, uh, I know a couple neighbors. There's a few people that live on my block that I know that I'm friendly with.

Speaker 4:          01:33:37       It's wet. People know, go outside. I think that it might even be like less about numbers and more about how many people go outside or not because it seems to me like in, in big cities, um, w or even suburbs of big cities, like everyone is pulled their car to their garage. They close their garage and then they're in their house and then um, if they're outside, they're in their backyard with her, you know, small family that there's not these large communities of people that are interacting outside. So maybe maybe you could have that kind of that safety or you know, everyone taking responsibility for people that you live with because you consider yourself living with them because you see them and you're next to them in some, in some place. But I'm like, if you're in Alaska, I imagine that even if you were in your, even if you're up there by yourself, you're still spending so much time outside because you still have to get so much for yourself I imagine or just get out to go pick it up wherever it's being shipped in.

Speaker 3:          01:34:34       Well, there's definitely that. It's much more expensive to get things up there and get food and groceries and things along those lines. Especially the more rural you get, the more problematic it is to get things delivered. No. Um, when I say my neighbors a Douche bag or something bad guys just kind of goofy, but there's some people in my neighborhood that are very cool, like, you know, I see them and it's nice. It's nice to have a community where, you know, you go up the street and you see, hey man, what's going on? What are you doing? You're still working on that. Oh that's cool. Blah Blah Blah. So it's nice like you have like this little sort of relationship with. But I didn't choose these people. I just moved in and I got lucky that some of them were okay and became friends with some along the way.

Speaker 3:          01:35:11       But it's like ideally I've always said the really smart thing to do would be get together with all your friends and loved ones and say, Hey, let's all live in this area. Let's all move to this one street. Is that possible to do like, let's get the other. But nobody ever really does that. They always say like, I've had 15 of those conversations with my friends and with my friend Brian. He just moved out in my neighborhood didn't. And I'm like, come, come, come look on my block. And it's like fucking guy moved like 10 miles away. I'm like, why did you move over there dummy? Oh my wife looks to be close to the grocery store, like fucking grocery store. You're going to get in your car anyway. Dummy isn't getting you car for 30 seconds or three minutes. Is it really that much of a difference?

Speaker 4:          01:35:48       And it maybe that was the idea like with neighborhoods that you would be living with people like, you know, you're all going the same place for work and everyone goes to same school and. But now your neighborhood is just full of all. Like it's such a, it's such a transient time. And, and also big houses, I think, you know, I'm in New York, I have friends who they go out to eat for most of their meals right there. Houses are large and so they're forced by lack of space. Again, it's kind of one of those space things where you have to go out and commune with other people and you have your seven favorite places and then by default those became. Come, you're a little community, but here you can. You can sustain yourself entirely within your, your house, your compound, and it's just made it so we don't have to really interact with anyone anymore.

Speaker 3:          01:36:34       That's a big thing with people. They like to be sustained and they like to have all of their stuff that they need. I mean, that's what. That's the prepper instinct, right? I've got enough food here for a year, like everybody's got this idea that if the shit goes down, I'm going to be fine. I'm going to just start piling. Just have a gun turret on my roof, I'm going to be fine, but I live in, in New York City I think is the worst case scenario because people like I have a friend who lives in New York. You can't even put his golf clubs in his apartment. He's got no room. He used to put it all in storage, so if he wants to play golf is to go to the storage place and open up his little spot with a key and go in and get as junk and like, oh, what are you doing? Like you're living in a box.

Speaker 4:          01:37:13       Yeah. My Post apocalypto is less about hoarding, you know, like food or whatever. It more about assembling a team. Like I'm looking for skill sets because a skill set you can take on the road and produce something with that skill set that is necessary. So I don't really care how much what you got in your garage or how much canned food you have. I care about like show me how fast you can clean a fish who can make medicine on herbs. Like that's, that's kind of more my. That's those are the applications taking now.

Speaker 3:          01:37:39       Sonata herbs, any medicine, any good that you can make other herbs you just laying around. Sure. What have you ever made?

Speaker 4:          01:37:45       Well, I mean there are, there's all sorts of things you can make an artist. Can you make a mud pack? I do. You know, do you know of the things that are in nature that you can, that you can take? What can you eat? What's edible? Like basic stuff like that. Like what? What is out here that people have known about for forever that no one knows about anymore? Like how, how much of people, how many Irish people started with the potato famine because no one knew anything about the plants that were sitting right there that they could have sustained themselves on the entire time. Sure. Eaten plenty of edible stuff. They just didn't have the thing that they had always eaten beforehand. Really? Sure. That seems like ridiculous. There's plenty of food mass there to eat, but if the skill set is gone, then it's really easy to kill yourself. Trying to figure it out for the first time.

Speaker 5:          01:38:32       I'm sure you've seen survivor man. You've seen that show less drought duck. I opened my eyes for watching that show. Watching how easy it is to not get food like you think, wow. The guys in the woods, plenty of stuff to eat out there and they seemed like foraging for food and trying to figure out how to like kill a squirrel with some sort of a rock that drops a little thing that he hits the switch and the rock falls on his head. Yeah. Not so good. It doesn't really work that well.

Speaker 4:          01:38:58       Who is that guy that John? Is it John mcclane is the guy who went out in the woods and then died in the bus. They made a movie out of it into the wild so that everyone's like the hypothesizing about like his, you know, his death and like, oh, he must've eaten this particular planning got poisoned and all the wild food experts aren't so he starved to death. It's very simple. He starved, he starved himself to death. Like one of the reasons humans have such a long juvenile period compared to any other primate is getting food is hard and it takes a really long time to be taught how to get it. Like to have this information handed down into to get the skill, the muscle if you will, to be able to do it and you expend so much energy trying to get it that you have to eat not only to cover that energy but enough to go beyond beyond that a little bit. And then if you're, you know, making kids or whatever, then there's all this extra stuff and it's very hard and no one has ever done it ever.

Speaker 5:          01:39:53       Yeah. We really got soft when it comes to that, the ability to feed yourself without a supermarket. It's very monumentally difficult task to do for the average person. That movie really pissed me off because they twisted the into the wild. They twisted the ending because in the movie he eats a poisonous plant and he gets sick and he dies. He missed misidentified as the wrong plant and his liver toxic and he dies. Right? But the reality is he did starve to death because it's fucking hard to get food, right? Like if you've ever gone hunting like this. One of the things that my friend Brian Count and I first realized the first hunting trip that we went on. Lucky we went with this guy, Steve Rinella is his famous hunter and we. But we're like Jesus, like how the fuck did they do this before they had guns?

Speaker 5:          01:40:39       Like we have guns and it's hard. We have guns and scopes and binoculars and a trained hunter and we know the territory and we have, we have a tags which like, so they know there's in the area, there's all these like things that are on our side and it's still a fucking for days with no success. I feel like if you didn't have food with you and you were going on these days with no success, you would be fucked. Like you would start. Like. It could be really easy to starve to death. Like real. That's with a gun. Like with a gun. It's easy to start without a gun. When you hear about someone that's like survived in the woods by themselves for like 20 years, like eating frogs and shit. You like what? How did that guy do it? Like that? To be like touch and go almost everyday.

Speaker 5:          01:41:28       Very few stockpiles. Very. Let me. How much can you store? You can only store like a couple days worth of vegetables or plant matter before that starts to go bad meat depending on the temperature. Usually only good for. Unless it's freezing cold out, you know, it's not good for more than a couple of days like you. You have to constantly be on the move, which is why cities weren't really figured out until we figured out how stockpile shit. Once they fail, stockpile shit and like, okay, we have a, a grain silo, we have enough food for a week. Hey, somebody should invent a way to make music out of a box. You know, let's make a piano.

Speaker 2:          01:42:06       Like all that much of free time on her hands. Yeah, yeah. No, it's. That is the container container. I think of container free life is kind of like my, my goal,

Speaker 5:          01:42:17       but isn't it kind of a catch 22? It's like you need society and culture in order to figure out how to make a computer, which allows you to learn about how to live in the wild. You know what I mean? You need, you need education in order to figure out what's going wrong with the human body, by living in this sedentary lifestyle that you have to go through this sedentary lifestyle to get that education, to figure out that it's not good for you. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:42:47       Well we've been in. Again, I mean that's what I could. Damien is like we're stockpiling information right, and now we've got to figure out a way to distribute it so it requires a whole new society. Like that's part of what civilization is to, is, is someone knows something that you don't know and that you might want to know that you find valuable so you can go do some of his work for him. So he'll tell you.

Speaker 5:          01:43:08       Do you think that ultimately the, the pattern that most people have chosen this like nine to five in a box and then still sat in the car drive, is that going to be, do you think will will realize somewhere down the line that that likes smoking is like really bad for you and we should try to phase that out and try to. Or do you think we're so caught up in this idea of achievement and, and our, our momentum is so in that direction that will never pull away from it? I,

Speaker 2:          01:43:35       no, I think, I think that we will. I mean, I think that, uh, like you with European countries playing around with things like four day work weeks, you know, how, how much work it doesn't take as much as much time as you're going to work. You're probably not working at some point. Someone I

Speaker 4:          01:43:51       hope is going to stand up and say I could do my job like in three hours a day. And I think um, as people are, you know, as, as businesses are laying off, people are doing enforced furloughs, you know, where they're saying, well you now have four days to get the same job done and you're gonna have to take a 20 percent pay cut. I think people are accepting that because now they get this extra day. They're actually better for it. They might have less money, but at home, you know, I think that if you've had some health issues usually end up valuing your health a little bit more. It's always after, I don't know if the up and comers will see it that way, but then for the up and comers, there's not a lot of jobs for those up and comers. There's not even, there's not even the option for nine to five work for so many people now who did what they were supposed to do, you know, when they went to school or whatever and they got a trade or a job, like there's no place for them, so then they're going, well I'll go back to school and try to get a better job.

Speaker 4:          01:44:46       So I think everything. I think everything we're to transition, a lot of things are gonna change and I think the work day in general with the commute, with the like digital commute, people being able to work from their computers wherever they are. Eventually corporations will see that it's cheaper. The cheaper for them to still make the same products, paying people less, but people get more free time.

Speaker 3:          01:45:08       Yeah, but people are always going to want more. That's the thing. It's like, I think if you could tell someone, hey, I can do the same job for three hours a day, they will be like good. That way. I saved money. Like, no, but we don't doing the same job. If I'm doing the same job, you're making the same amount of money. Yeah, but you only working three hours a day, eight hours a day, but I'm getting the same shit done, but we don't really reward people sort of. Well, some jobs do, but most jobs it's about the amount of hours you put in.

Speaker 4:          01:45:37       Yeah, well I think that that person know who said I can do it in three hours a day is going to be replaced by someone who does like you'll just keep working. You'll find someone who can do the job faster and for less, and the only thing keeping people who don't do that in their seats is a maybe the law at a certain point. Like if who you can fire and who you can't fire if people are tenured or or whatever that. Hasn't that been the transition for like the last 30 or 40 years where you're just paying people less relatively speaking, you know, the dollar is, is different than what it was, but aren't we paying people less who are working? Wait. Like who doesn't work like seven days a week who goes home and doesn't still have their email on and still answering emails. I think that they're getting. I think that they're getting a lot more work out of people for what they used to pay and that the fact they are paying people less.

Speaker 3:          01:46:27       That is an issue. I have a friend who has an issue with his work because once he's done working he will not answer emails. He's like, when I'm done, I'm done and he's, he's successful enough so that you can kind of pull this off, but it's a real issue that we were trying to reach you all day. He's like, I was done. I'm done working. When I'm done, I shut my email off and I go places without cell phone service and like,

Speaker 6:          01:46:50       you know, he's like, well, what's going on? Am I working for you guys 24 hours a day? Like, like if they send him an email at like 10:00 at night, they get upset if you respond to it in the morning, like I sent you this at 10:00 at night. He's like, fuck you. Fuck, okay. You don't own me. Right? This is, this is what we're doing. I mean he's in a weird position because he's a without outing him. He's a big wig so his, his situation is very strange but his stance is not. His stance is like the stance that a lot of people would like to take. Like when the fucking day is over, it's over. You don't own me all through the night with email, but that's like sort of creeped into people's life space. Yeah. Yeah. Do you ever work with a company like Zephyr company ever come to you and said, hey, like we would like to ultimately like from the beginning of our company would like to engineer this thing to be like a healthier environment for our employees. Like what is a way we can get the most amount of productivity, but also keep people as healthy as possible and give them an environment that's more conducive to just being an active healthy person.

Speaker 4:          01:47:52       Yeah, sure. You know like what are the. I mean there are simple, simple things that people can do. Employers can do to provide their employees with a healthier version, I guess of what? Of the nine to five. You don't have to sit like roving desks. That was a big one. Not, not having everyone at the same desk. It's like going into the same desk every single day is an issue. It's an environmental killer. Like you're looking at the same wall. You're looking in the same.

Speaker 6:          01:48:19       Put our go to picture my daughter more worried for you and there's my golf club Monaco. More thing I put here about the things like you just are just so attached to their people working. Yeah. What keeps you working as buying new shit? Know, like the thing at the end of the week I'm going to get that purse. Woo. That watch I've got my eye on you. That's what keeps you going. Otherwise I'm like, why the fuck am I doing this? Especially jobs, they don't like. Rewards are critical. Right?

Speaker 4:          01:48:47       But then it turns out that they don't even like the reward that much because it's just onto the next reward. How do we fix this? Can I have a community that I am taking up?

Speaker 6:          01:48:56       Okay. She was opening a call your community up north? Yeah. Take applications for you.

Speaker 4:          01:49:02       Well, um, I have applications or for my poke post apocalypto team, but yeah, really banking on that. Well, you know what it is. I just, I really feel like I, I, it's like with shoes, I wear regular shoes my whole entire life. And then you switched to something minimal and you didn't even know how they, how your feet were feeling all day long. It's very hard to sense how something is limiting you until you take yourself out and away from it. It's like going camping. Like everyone feels better when they go camping and they're out hiking. It's like, I feel so good. This thing that I had this chronic headache, this vision problem, the, this irritation with my family or whatever it is. When you go outside and you can't, like all of a sudden it's different. You've, you've changed it up enough where it's different.

Speaker 4:          01:49:47       Well, I feel like that indoors now after being outside so much, um, after spending so much time, I'm like, I can feel this chair right now. I haven't sat in a chair continuously in probably two years. This was the only time you've sat. Now I don't have furniture. I'm like, I got rid of my couch. Right? So we should. I know now you know, this show just took a turn. You're a crazy person. You have a couch and don't have a couch and watch netflix sitting on the floor in front of my laptop. You sit on a floor like some sort of barbarian for real, for real. Do you have cable tv at home or you just one of those Weirdos? Weirdos. I get everything in. I mean, I like Netflix and stuff, but I don't have Netflix as a guess. I love Netflix. I love it.

Speaker 4:          01:50:39       You can, you can watch anything. You don't need cable TV pretty close to. You can find just about anything that you want to watch. But you know, I don't, I, I'm, I'm, I'm a worker. Like I work a lot. I'm very busy. Um, I participate in society so it's like how can I, how can I do all those things and, and keep my pelvic shape in the low back shape that I wanted and the strength without having to go to do those things separately from my regular life. So I just sit on the floor. I mean you've outsourced the work to your most of your muscular system, to your couch. You have books. How did you write those books? On my laptop. Did you, how'd you sit in many different ways like, and not in one just, you know, cross legged laying on my stomach. Sometimes they'll sit in a chair or I'll stand at the counter. My, your buck. It would if, if you work that way exclusively, but, but not if you spent 20 minutes. There you go do that and call it a yoga pose. Right?

Speaker 4:          01:51:40       Well, someone would, someone would call it some animal's name was right? Yeah. So you just move around in different ways. Nothing completely sedentary or static. Yeah, and it's because I don't think that we're, you know, we say we're too sedentary and it's like I would say that you have too much repetitive geometry which are different, which is different, you know, so it's like you got to get out of your couch and exercise. I would say maybe you just get out of your couch. Maybe you keep watching Netflix. Just sit cross legged on the floor. Just put your legs out in front of you because that is movement. That is exercise. It's just not in a special clothing. In a class, in a gym. I go over my friend's house and they have chairs. No, my kids freaks. No, they are. They're a little freaky for everyone else, but they are now. They've never been sick. I've never been sick. No. What is that? Got Alien Kids. You don't bring them anywhere. Travel all over the world because you are a filtration system and movement is your biggest changer

Speaker 2:          01:52:46       and most people don't move at all. They're too busy trying to figure out how to not be stick. Stick with these clogged up filters like your whole lymphatic system depends on movement. A function like the biggest physical movement portion of your immune system depends on movement. It doesn't have its own pump. It uses the muscular.

Speaker 4:          01:53:04       What do you mean by that? Like your immune system relies on movement.

Speaker 2:          01:53:09       Yes, your lymphatic system, right? So that's, that's what's taking your cellular waste and then moving it out of your body. It's like it's. It's laying right next to your arterial and venous system. So as muscles work, they pump the blood over to the working tissues and then it kind of washes everything away. So your lymphatic system doesn't need a pump because why would it need a pump? Why would you not be moving? Why would a human not be moving? Why would an Orca not be swimming in the ocean? It's because you have these parts of your body that are movement dependent because movement is something that humans should be doing all of the time. It's only in recent times that, that we haven't needed to move. So then these systems that are movement dependent is

Speaker 4:          01:53:55       Kinda fail. Yeah. But my kids get sick and my kids move a lot. They do. They do gymnastics classes, exercise classes, and they're in school and they're doing, I mean, what? Are you kids going to school? No.

Speaker 2:          01:54:09       Yeah, I mean I might. My three and a half year ago

Speaker 4:          01:54:12       it started in preschool, but he's in a nature school, right? So it's all outside nature. School side. People are freaks. We're going deep here. What does this mean in nature? School school?

Speaker 2:          01:54:23       It's um, it's been around for like 15 years where they're, they don't have a building. They do all their work outside.

Speaker 4:          01:54:30       They don't have a building. No. So what happens when it rains? You go to school, go to school and you know, humans. And what happens? People live in the woods. So you just use an umbrella. No read under a tent. No, they're, they're not doing that traditional kind of sitting and reading and working with paper. They're learning edibles and their learning. I mean they're hiking and they're moving and they're doing their math, you know, buy, get this many branches and how to build a fire. And so you teach the kids to be grizzly Adams. Kind of. Yeah. This is fascinating. How many kids go to your school with your kids? Well, I think there's 10, 12, 10, 12 woodsy. People that come down with like leaves in their hair and not really. I am the woods easiest. You're the woods, the woods where they are not, you're not very what? You seem totally normal to me I'm totally almost normal. Yes. I'm totally normal.

Speaker 2:          01:55:21       I just like kids move, like movement. There's movement and then there's exercise and they're two different things and you know, like gymnastics and like taking these movement classes is not the kind of movement that I'm talking about, you know, like recess and stuff that that's a certain amount of movement. But you know, like the, like

Speaker 4:          01:55:43       my kids move all day long. I know. Everyone's like, yeah, my kids when they're so they're active, they're kids. I'm like, no, I'm talking about like my kids will walk two to three miles a day and they could hang and climb and suspend themselves. You know, by the time they're one, they move more like monkeys. They're very confident and strong and capable because they've been put into challenging environments and they have never. They don't have chairs or anything. They said no. He goes eat. We eat at a low table. Sat on the floor with a low table. Japanese style. Yeah. The bulk of the world doesn't have furniture. I know it seems radical that I don't have furniture, but the bulk of humans right now on the planet don't have furniture. Like you have furniture. It's a real. Your. The weirdo also ruled the world. Well, that's the thing.

Speaker 4:          01:56:34       That's true TV. Probably couches. Yeah. So you really do have no furniture in your house? Well, I mean I have to core, but no, I don't have couches. Sleep. We sleep on pads on the floor. On the floor. No pillows, pillows, north your pillows. A cast. Do you think your heads should be laid out in front of you like that whole entire time? Right? You have a pillow underneath your head between your shoulders and you sleep on your back. I sleep. I move constantly because it's never really comfortable. So in that way, in that way, Mike, my, I move at night like just like any other animal. You're going going, going back to the roots I think for disease and health yet is. I think it's required. Do you ever go on the road and staying at a bed and go, fuck, this is awesome.

Speaker 4:          01:57:29       I do. And the couches Galore when I'm on vacation, my husband had to like turn on the television, love it, but it's like dessert, dessert, but we don't have this at home. We're just going to have this one. We're on the road. Right. You know, like any other sensible thing, intake of sensible thing. Is there a way around it? I mean, can you have a bed that's like semi comfortable? Was Zero, zero, like a medium ground or middle ground? Yeah. Well, I mean I think it all just depends on how your, your state, like I'm looking for really strong cells had toe, so like it just comes from the loads that you expose them to like your, if you think of like what is the natural environment for your body, like you go to a massage therapist like to push on you and give you pressure.

Speaker 4:          01:58:13       It's like because your input you are missing. Well I get it every night on the ground so I'm not missing. I'm not missing all of that movement. And in helping those tissues become unstuck because the floor does that for you for free while you sleep. Wait a minute. You think that going and lying on the ground on the floor is the equivalent to going and getting like deep tissue massage? Um, well pressure wise it's the same. It's the same thing. It's, it's pressure. That's what makes sleeping on the floor so uncomfortable. I don't have ever gone camping and slept on the ground and everyone's like hurting the next day. Like you don't have the, you don't have the strength really to do that. You don't have the suppleness of the tissues and so you stiffen and react to it. Kind of like if someone pushes on you really hard, like too deep at first you tense your muscles in responsible with with time, the way how you're probably imagining sleeping on the ground feels is not how it feels to me anymore. It's how it felt to me at the beginning, but not how it feels to me anymore.

Speaker 5:          01:59:15       Well, I've camped a bunch of times, especially over the last couple years, have done several times, five slash six days in a stretch and sucks. It's just not comfortable, but it doesn't feel like deep tissue massage, like the difference between massage, especially sports massage is you're needing out knots and different scar tissue and blockages that have happened from extreme, from strenuous exercise. I just don't see how laying on the ground would do that.

Speaker 4:          01:59:41       Your jeep, your massage is targeted and in, in local to whatever area someone is applying it. So in that way the sensations are different because this is just kind of whole body all at the same time, but mechanically speaking it's the same. It's the same thing, it's pressure, it's pressure being applied to tissue, something pushing on it and moving it around and it's uncomfortable at first because it's such a large surface area of your body. It's not you being comfortable everywhere else and then someone working on, you know, three inches or seems like that's like a mini. Well, because it's hard because I mean heart to hard is not natural either. Right? If you're going to sleep, just imagine what they want. Something soft. Yeah. You always be seeking something comfortable. It's just that you, your bed is so comfortable. What it does is it doesn't reveal your discomfort, so you just assume one position again the same geometry almost all night long.

Speaker 4:          02:00:39       So in that way your movement is less where I moved much more during that eight hours so that eight hours my cells have a different experience than someone who's sleeping in a bed and on a pillow and. And when I'm uncomfortable, I'm, I changed position, which is all the time it was at first. Yeah. But how long have you been doing this for? I've been probably 18 months without a bed. Something smaller. How long did it take to get used to? It took me like a year to get rid of my pillow. It took them a year to get rid of my pillow. Right. Because it was tight through the neck. Even though I did, you know, all the same neck mobilization and got massage all of the time. The bulk of my day was doing the same thing with how often do you have to turn your head and look up or look down.

Speaker 4:          02:01:29       There's no need for actually using the muscles of your neck anymore. But finally I was like, you know, after doing the stretch I was like, where? Why am I doing this stretch? Like where would this stretch happen? Naturally it's like, okay, well if I was laying on my side curled up, you know, if you look at your dog or your cat sleeping there. Thirdly, doing these weird positions and poses and then I found the literature on it in the journal. It's like, yeah, we think that a lot of low back pain is coming from these repetitive sleeping positions on, on beds and here's how all these humans sleep. Here's all, all these other primates and other animals sleep. There seems to be some weird way about the way we sleep, so I just cleaned up that environment for myself about a hard mattress. You could do a hard mattress if you have a soft one now.

Speaker 4:          02:02:13       A hard one would give you more pressure. Yeah, I mean it's definitely gradual, you know, it's not with a pillow. I took my pillow size and then over a year just came down to a smaller and smaller pillow and eventually tee shirt until I didn't need it. And with the bed the bed was more organic because we had little kids and so it seems like you're never sleeping in your own bed. Like everyone's always moving around beds and I slept in a different mattress, like this metric sucks. And then I was like, that's ridiculous. Like it's mattress. My body should have enough give where, you know, a slightly different baby pressure isn't stressing my body out and then that's when I just started to explore this kind of stuff. A lot of people that are doing this are sleeping on the ground and having no couches. I think furniture free takes awhile.

Speaker 4:          02:02:59       You don't have to give up your couch views. Said how about just sitting on the floor instead of it, you know, it's just with the sitting is the new smoking stuff. That's the thing that that research really showed is that you can be this like really great exerciser or it was a new category of sedentary active that, that all of the active than fittest people within our culture are still sedentary. They're like moving like four percent of the day. And since your body again is movement dependent, their systems in the fittest, people are like four percent better than the people who don't move at all. So there's like all this space to get better physically. And again, when I say better, I'm really talking about basic biological things like procreating, digesting food. Some people can't even go to the bathroom like their guts and their, their bathroom doesn't work and these are again basic human functions.

Speaker 4:          02:03:48       They can't sleep well and like they're not being like their humanness is impaired in the same way that you would see. Again, like in zoo animals, like just pacing and they're not, they're not on their bio. Rhythms all messed up, so I thought, well I can get myself back on track. I don't need a couch. It turned out to be better in all these other things that we're talking about, consumerism for our family and space and, and, and I'm having little kids you know and run around and less to clean and just less. It's just less minimal minimalism, which ends up being maximalism at for your biology. Wow. I'm still tripping out on the fact that your kids don't get sick. I'm trying to figure out how that's possible. That little immune systems are subject to so many different little bugs and stuff when they're hanging out with other little kids. I know, but they just have the strength to push it right through. Like it

Speaker 2:          02:04:37       just. I think that. I think that with a lot of illness it's the delay, right? It's like you're making the music as it sits around for so long, it just takes like what we envisioned being sick is, is the coping mechanism. It's like a sluggish immune system, so it's not that my kids don't interact with it, but it just happens faster. I don't know. I mean we, again, we travel all over United States, Canada and Europe for six weeks. They dust. They're very robust. Kids vaccinated? No, not yet. Not yet. I'm not an anti vaccine nation. I just, again, I'm a have a particular timeline in a development that I want them to explore first and I don't want encroached with any of that stuff. And so I maximize lots of other things. Well, so like with, with I'm also an extended breast feeder so like my children had been breastfed for like the oldest one.

Speaker 2:          02:05:42       He stopped when he was three and a half years. So a lot of people don't have that going on. And then, you know, with my younger one, she's just too. And so she's still breastfeeding. So there's lots of other things that I do. I'm not really a, don't do her. I'm more like here's all the things that um, that ended up improving their immune system. You know, they play in dirt, they've never been exposed to antibiotics or anti bacterial products, you know, things that now are showing up to accumulate in the system. And so I think that, I think that has a lot to do with it.

Speaker 3:          02:06:16       Do you have any issue or any worry or concern about your kids catching measles or mumps or one of these dangerous diseases that have had a resurgence because of a lack of vaccinations? I mean that's, that's a big issue in the east coast is the measles and mumps and things along those lines that used to be kind of knocked down now because a lot of people don't want to vaccinate their kids. You're seeing this make a resurgence.

Speaker 2:          02:06:41       Yeah. Well I mean I wear, like I said, we're not, I'm not an anti vaccs like the reason like you're really vaccinating is for the benefit of weaker people for the most part because measles as a whole is not something that is that dangerous. I mean there are very few incidences even when it was really bad that it would cause death or whatnot. So there'll be vaccinated at a certain point for, for the benefit of the community. I just am not loading really their systems with anything. I'm not particularly worried about exposure. They know they don't go to places where measles, I mean, excuse me, where measles occurs. Like they're not in doctor's offices. So they travel all over the world. Well they travel all over the world. That's the other thing. But I mean as, as far as as I spend time

Speaker 4:          02:07:35       detecting where like there was a, there was someone who was exposed to measles in Washington who came from Disneyland. So they. So I got a notification saying this person went from Disneyland to the Seatac airport who then went to this place, if you've been at any of these three places, which is what our, you know, the government put out in local government. That was recently, like in the last week and a half. No, this is, I just got the, I got it like in the last week and a half. So there are, there are those cases. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          02:08:08       So you're not concerned with that. And it's, uh, it's interesting that we have these, um, these ideas about what diseases we need to be gravely concerned about. Like measles is one, chicken pox is another belly. Uh, all the different ones that people are terrified of, the one that kills everybody, the flu, the flu fucking kills the shit out of people. There's so many people that die every year, the flu, but most people don't get a flu shot.

Speaker 4:          02:08:32       Yeah. Shot. Yeah. Well, I just, again, from a biological standpoint, I think we're looking at problems from, we're all sick in this zoo. Like we don't see that. Like you're, you're, the way that you are interacting with the disease has a lot to do with the state of the being that you're bringing to the disease. So I'm working to maximize the state of the being.

Speaker 6:          02:08:55       What about nutrition? Like what kind of nutrition?

Speaker 4:          02:08:58       Well, that's the same thing. So my kids, like I, I'm, I'm much more scared by what other people feed their family. I think then I am about diseases that they'll pick up. So we don't really eat any processed food on a regular basis. Mostly I think for the first couple of years of their life they had exclusively proteins and vegetables exclusively. Yeah. Like they never had a goldfish cracker, let me know. They are swallowing a live fish. I've been talking about the goldfish cracker. They never had a cheerios or goldfish crackers or any of that kind of stuff. But um, yeah, like we, I make cookies, I make desserts. They have sweets and, and I'm more lenient now, but like in that first hunk of time, you know, when they're, when they're developing so much, but you know, like they had popsicles, like they're regular kids you wouldn't even know because I want them to fit.

Speaker 4:          02:09:51       I want us all to fit in society. As weird as my life sounds. You wouldn't even really know it. We throw great parties at our house and every house has just decorated kind of like Moroccan style. It just looks like wow. They have a lot of cool floor pillows or whatever. The whole. It's not just like you walk into a house going, where's all the furniture? This is weird. It's not like that. It's just, it's just slightly, it's just this kind of our, our odd are oddness and we are the only friends in our group that are like this, you know, so to them we're kind of frigates like no one likes the desserts that I make for kids, birthday parties or whatever, but that all being said, you know, everyone's kids are like, they're like, oh, there are kids are melting down because of Xyz. And I was like, yeah, but our kids, we don't have that. I mean they have kid meltdowns or whatever, but they just, they just sleep regularly. They're, they're healthy, they're pretty healthy.

Speaker 6:          02:10:42       Well, it sounds the sound ridiculously healthy. They're healthy. They've never been sick. That's, that's. I've never heard of anything like that before. That's really shocking to me. I mean, I thought that that was just like a natural part of being a child to gets sick. Your immune system rebounds and strengthens. It is actually good to expose your sick kids.

Speaker 4:          02:11:01       I mean, and we don't, we don't keep them away from. We don't keep them away from sick people. They just, if they get sick, it's just, it doesn't look like what getting sick would look like. I mean, they're still interacting with any pathogens and they're responding to it.

Speaker 6:          02:11:15       Oh, I see what you're saying. So if they get sick, it's, it's a minor thing, but you wouldn't even the processes and you don't even know.

Speaker 4:          02:11:21       Well, you don't even know that there's, I mean, I wouldn't even know that they're sick

Speaker 6:          02:11:25       because it never, they never get to an overload points.

Speaker 4:          02:11:28       What is sick? What is sick? Like sick to me is, you know, I think um, my son had, he just had his second fever and almost four in four years and there was no overnight. Well he just went to bed with a fever and he woke up. I think if so, I. So for me like sick is like they've been to the doctor, they've taken a medication.

Speaker 6:          02:11:51       Okay. So what you're saying, so you think sick is he needs medical attention?

Speaker 4:          02:11:56       Yeah. Or you know how to, how to stay home from school or had you know, something running down out of his nose or whatever. Like to me like the, like the fever, that fever that he had was like he's just hot and then it was just gone. So you slept it up? Yeah. Well I don't know. I guess I guess I compare it to myself. Like I was at the pediatrician's office a lot as a kid. I was, I remember taking antibiotics once a quarter, like a lot.

Speaker 6:          02:12:25       And do you find yourself sick less as well? Yeah, I mean all of us as a family that's so unusual. All my friends that have young children around my kids' age work, everyone's battling colds all the time because your kid's a little petri dishes.

Speaker 4:          02:12:38       Yeah. And that's the same thing. So I thought, I just thought the same thing. Like I compared to our group of families who all have little kids, I would say that they're sick a lot and so I, you know, it's like this person is sick, this person sick, this person sick. And we always just go to the party. It's like whatever. Because I want my, I'm not, I know that they get healthier through interacting with it, but I just had my first cold in, I don't know, like two years maybe. And I, and I've had kids for almost four. And what is your diet like? Like what do you eat? Same thing as a kid. A lot of fat, a lot of protein engineered. That's on purpose. It's on purpose. You know, I, I try not to. It turned out to eat a lot of processed foods and then a lot of like, we don't do a lot of bread. You don't need a lot of bread, but we're not totally green free. Like I like Amaris, you know, like in, in of like different grains, Amaranth, just to a grain or TAF, which is an Ethiopian grain. They're just, they're just freak food. What is this talk? What about white bread? Yeah. What am I wonder? Wonder. No wonder. No peanut butter and jelly sandwiches in your house. We have our version. I know, I know, I know, I know. Good Lord. It's really weird.

Speaker 6:          02:13:55       Yeah, real weird. Then we take your kids to Disneyland. They see soda and popcorn and shit like that. They freak out.

Speaker 4:          02:14:03       They, they freak out about food in packages. It's like, it seems to be the packaging more than anything else. Like what does that thing with the knob that they have, you know, like the other kids have that and we'll let them, you know, like if we're going, I'm not going to be like, no, you can't have that. You know, if someone's handing out something to everybody, it's like, of course you know, you're, you're a kid. This is your community, this is your time. But I don't go out of my way to make it, to put it in there

Speaker 6:          02:14:26       for them. I remember when I was a kid, TV dinners had a very special appeal to me. Like there's something about the TV dinner, like all of it in that little tray, like the little potatoes or like molded to the little tiny little spot where the potatoes go and the Brownie was baked right in it. I remember Barry Steak with the stuff on the meanwhile, if you had to eat that now, he'd be like, Christ, what am I putting in my body?

Speaker 4:          02:14:48       Kenna was so one, like all those foods. I look at all the foods and all the sitcoms that I watched as a TV and it's constantly, you know, as a parent you're going, am I going too far with this? A little bit? Do I want my kids, you know, to have, you know, I really liked my childhood. My childhood was awesome. The only thing that I was just playing with here is biological function because I think I, you know, the difference between our kids and Oz is that we grew up in a different time. Like there were no computers. Like I didn't really sit down in front of a computer until I was maybe 20. You know, I had a typewriter and you know, I took typing in high school, but you were running around, you know, after school for the most part. And, and now you know, my, my one year old had my iphone.

Speaker 4:          02:15:38       I can, she's a swiping through picking the game that she wants to play and you're like, like it's, she is going to be cast did so much earlier by, by this because zero to five is so important and it's going to be just so isn't it interesting that, that it's going to be more than what we think is going to be. It's going to affect more than her eyes. It's going to affect more than, than her hips, you know, it's going to be really how she thinks, how, how they, how they both think is just going to be so impacted by the age of information.

Speaker 6:          02:16:10       How did you find this freaky nature school thing? Like how did that, is that the, is that something that you knew about before you moved to the location you live in?

Speaker 4:          02:16:18       It just, it just started its first year. So it's a, it's a model that they've had in Germany for a long time. They've had this kind of for what they call forest kindergarten for maybe 10 years. So it's, it's popular in Europe. Um, it just started coming over here. There's probably, if you looked online, you could find, um, maybe 100 schools already operating like this and they're just, they're just outdoor preschools, although they're starting to go up higher, you know, where there they're doing the curriculum does based on child led interests. You know, I like my son came home and were just like taking a hike some time and he was telling me the names of the trees and stuff, like stuff that I didn't even know. And, and so it's not, it's not like doing block, you're not sitting out in the forest, you know, stacking blocks, you're not coding colors or you're not doing any.

Speaker 4:          02:17:11       I think they call them Schema, like, like you're not doing any sort of structured Schema, but it's, it happens all very organically. You just start to notice, you know, I think it's definitely lends it self to a scientific kind of outcome because you know, my son's like, Hey, look at the frost patterns on this versus this. Like, here's how you can tell, you know, where it was frosty and like, this is clearly underwater. So they're, they're just starting to recognize and observe deed data and details about things. So I like that, you know, I'm a scientist, so I like that I see things that way. So you know, I don't know if it'll work for both my kids, but it definitely works for my son who's more kinda like

Speaker 6:          02:17:53       me. I'm fascinated by the fact that you as a scientist now, someone who is an expert in human movement and biomechanics and all that, you've decided to try to engineer your children from the jump. You know, I don't know anybody that's done that. Now it's done it to such a degree that you've done it where you've gotten rid of your couch and sit on the floor and you got your kids in some theory. Woods school. They were born at home, right? I mean it's born at home. Oh, Christ woman. Now you're going crazy. What would you do if it was a breach? If you had to spin the kid around in the box? Good midwives can do a lot of stuff, but it was very, very close to a hospital. I know. Freak you out. Yeah. Didn't freak me out.

Speaker 4:          02:18:36       No. I have watched and been at lots of births. Pelvic pelvic floor mechanics was my whole undergraduate biomechanics work. So when you know a lot about something, there's not a lot of fear there. Oh, that makes sense. There was a healthy dose of of emergency preparedness to make sure that everything was going to be okay, but. But there was a, there wasn't a lot of tension or stress in me because I was. It was pretty

Speaker 6:          02:18:57       cool with it. What about if you need stitches or any things along those lines? They can do all that. Midwife, midwife. I didn't do it myself, but my wife can stitch you up. Yeah. Oh Christ. Some amateur lady down there. Not An amateur in you with a needle and thread. Oh, Christ. Knitting needles. Dirty fingernails and no soap. Don't know what you soap. We want to keep everything biological. No, it's not like that. Did you use a tub? Did you give birth to the kid in the water one? Yes. One.

Speaker 4:          02:19:28       No.

Speaker 5:          02:19:28       The water thing is a freaky one. That's a lot of people that I've known that have tried to do the birth in house, have done it in the tub to think it's very strange.

Speaker 4:          02:19:38       Well, it makes it very comfortable and supported, you know, what your labor and let people get out though, you know, to actually do the birthday climb out of the tub. It just, it's uh, you know, there are certain positions. It's really hard. You know, you're, you're teaching people how to kick and you're like, you don't have the hip range of motion to kick. Well, what if you don't have the hip range of motion to squat these unnecessary positions that open all the bones up. Lot of people can't get into them.

Speaker 5:          02:19:58       Well, I've always wondered about people that need to sarian sections, like women with rain, narrow hips and you know, they have a large husband and the baby's got a giant fucking head. Like, oh, what would you do in the wild? Like you would die?

Speaker 4:          02:20:13       No, I think it's. I think that again, there's a lot of things like the growth rate of the baby that our diet and movement related. Again, that growth rate of the baby, yes. Like yes, like your baby is not this arbitrary size. It just pops out like in its DNA are going to be eight point eight pounds or whatever. It's not, it's not like that. There is a relationship in gestation that has to do with that for a while. They couldn't figure out like what's the, what's the signal for a woman? You start giving birth and they're like, oh, it's got to be something to do with the size of the head and the and the pelvis and the autism signal and the lungs. Like they're trying to figure it out. Like we still don't know a lot of basic things about how this species worked.

Speaker 4:          02:20:53       We've kind of gone right down into like advanced technology and no one's really done a lot of work just going, how does this, how does this species work before we go over and look at other animals? Like how does this one work again? Um, and so the big thing was like narrow hips, like narrow hips is one of my, is one of my pet peeves, like telling women that they're too small to give to give birth, but then they look at data of women who are up and move more through their pregnancy and head circumference, you know, that, that, that the shape of the baby again is based on movement of the vessel in which it's in that, that it's becoming more understood to be very mechano regulated. Mechano meaning like any sort of mechanical forces on the embryo in the embryo is sensing movement and there's pressure on the uterus and, and, and that's an environment. It's an, a mechanical environment, affects foot position, the ability for it to move and twist and to start that developmental phase. And there's a lot of things that we do that limits developing human movement because we are so still.

Speaker 5:          02:21:58       So the more active your child is a child or the more active you are, rather it changes the shape of your child in the womb, the size of your child, brother in the womb.

Speaker 4:          02:22:08       We'll allow it affects their spacing. It affects their space and the pressures that are on them that are there mechanical environment

Speaker 5:          02:22:17       and how does that affect a woman having narrow hips? I mean this. Is it possible that a baby would be small enough that it would pass through if she's really. Whereas if she's sedentary and she has narrow hips, the baby's just going to be too big and fat. Is that what it is?

Speaker 4:          02:22:30       Well, it's not. I mean narrow hips like your, your, your hip, the obstetrical conjugate this space, you know, where the baby is coming out is not a set structure. You have hinges in. There were things articulate and become bigger or smaller as needed, but those hinges, being able to articulate depends on how fluid you yourself made. Like how much, how much movement did you do, you know, were you squatting for a long period of time? So like squatting is something that's totally natural for humans and humans would have to do it a few times a day to bathroom, but also getting up and down off of the floor. So you imagine what the shape of the pelvis would be in the mall. The mobility of the hips and the sacred and all these joints that play a role in birth and then you go how but how natural are they not when you want to take them to something like birthing that everyone does. So I'm a, I'm a natural birthing advocate, but at the same time I'm more an advocate for like if you, if you want to have like a vaginal delivery instead of Assyrian, there's work to do in the same way. If you want to do a certain kick, you know, for your martial arts class that takes training to reestablish this shape and mobility so that you don't have too small of a space.

Speaker 5:          02:23:45       So what do you do to stretch out your quote unquote space?

Speaker 4:          02:23:49       Well you, you just become more mobile. So the hips in general, so like, like I couldn't well more, more specifically like furniture, like again, look at your relationship with your furniture. So you know, getting pregnant women off the couch and onto a floor and in, in, in what happens when you get on the floor, when you get on the floor, you're essentially doing something that looks like the exercise that you go to a class to do for an hour, right? So all the things that you do, if you go to prenatal yoga, they give you hip opening exercise and like to sit on the floor. You can go to the classes too, but don't go back onto the couch, which is putting you back into the position that you're adapting to it. You don't adapt anymore to your class. Then you do two sitting on the couch. You adapt to what you do 100 percent of the time. So just sit on the floor in that position that you're doing

Speaker 5:          02:24:39       and how has it say on the forum more beneficial because you're supporting your weight on a flat structure, a flat surface.

Speaker 4:          02:24:46       Well, you can't physically assume the same geometry and the couch that you are in the chair, right? So you automatically have to rotate your hips and drop your knees and your pelvis. Now you're engaging, your core muscles are working, so the baby's getting bigger, but you're on the couch, so even though the baby's getting bigger, that weight's never put on the muscles that hold the baby, so then you have to start tucking your pelvis under a, wearing a baby support belt because you're not training your muscles relative to the natural mass accumulation of having a baby. You have to be up and moving around with that weight in order to adapt to it. You can't put a Kettlebell in your lap, trained to it, you to move it and swinging it around. He had to move and swing around your pregnancy weight to adapt to it.

Speaker 6:          02:25:27       And women that have natural or naturally small hips and they can do all this. You think it would aid them and they would have like a normal birth or would they still have like a huge issue? I know a lot of women, like especially in Western medicine, they get to a point where they're like, look, we've got to cut you. We can't, that baby's not going to come out.

Speaker 4:          02:25:47       There's a, there's a lot of factors that affect, um, the birthing process and I don't think that there is as much evidence for space being a factor as it is used as a casual reason to like what I mean if you're at the point where you've tried to labor and it's not happening, you move to a Sicilian that's pretty normal. Um, but the situation in which that Labor has happened is usually in a city is in a, is in a position where the forces aren't necessarily in your favor. Right? Like if you're on your back the whole entire time, it's like the baby's not moving down. It's like, well, what could you do to help bring it down? Like you could be more upright. You can, there's so many things you can do, but they don't necessarily happen well in a hospital that have their own set of rules and equipment in which they have to be monitoring you with. So a lot of the tradeoff for constant monitoring and emergency care is the OP. The optimal process is sometimes compromised, too. Uncomfortable questions the placenta. Okay. What do you do with that? Well with my son, it went in the ocean with my daughter. It went into the woods when I was done. It usually just goes into a bag in the freezer bag in the freezer, freeze it until it's. It's hard.

Speaker 4:          02:27:11       I mean, I mean it becomes hard after you put it in the freezer that why do you put in the oil? It's bloody and goopy. Just. You can't really throw it in the trash. I mean it has to, has to be. Has to have some place where it can safely breakdown away from people you couldn't. I guess you could say. Well I mean it's, it's biomass, right? It's right. But isn't that like food scraps and that's what it is. It is just like a. it's like a takeout bag. You don't eat it though. I didn't even know. Uncomfortable question. Oh, is that what the question is now? Some people do, some people do. That's a big thing because you know, that's what an animal, a guy. I'm more of biomechanics, so like movement in geometry, like as opposed to like eating my placenta. I didn't do that. Some people boil it down and make a tea or dehydrated, make a powder, scramble it. Well, I think that the thought is right. So most animal mothers eat it.

Speaker 6:          02:28:05       Yeah, but the reason is not devoid off predators because the smell.

Speaker 4:          02:28:11       Who knows? That's what you've been told. Well that's definitely what it is. With certain animals like deer

Speaker 6:          02:28:17       biomap, they don't eat animal protein other than that,

Speaker 4:          02:28:21       but.

Speaker 6:          02:28:22       But because they've been doing it for a long time, there can be something that's consumed in that movement of or that in that choice of doing so that comes along with it. There's a lot of. In biology there's a lot of naturally occurring byproduct just because of the relationship of how something has been done for a long period of time. So like I use bees pollinating as an example. It's like bees aren't. They're not actively pollinating, they're just eating, but their structure is is pollinating by default just because it happened to be the right structure that had some static electricity because of the way that the wings flew around and then it happened and p Harry instead of smooth so that the pollen could stick in there and then it just brushes up against it and it becomes this vessel, but that's a byproduct of Polynesian is just something that occurs because of a structure.

Speaker 6:          02:29:13       So if you eat something to keep a Predator from coming, coming up, but you've always done it. Then there can be some sort of compound that triggers milk production. Like who knows, who knows what it's in. So when you. When you look at a population of people who are having kids and it's like wow, there's a very large percentage of this population that's struggling just after having a baby. Could we be missing some sort of naturally occurring nutrient? And I think that's why people take the placenta is because they're just trying to hedge their bets. Like maybe inside the placenta is something that keeps me from feeling whatever, whatever issue like there are diagnosed with, you know, if it plays some sort of role in hormonal regulation afterwards, is it part of the input that changes how your physiology starts going back to what it was before.

Speaker 6:          02:30:05       There's so much that we don't know that things are very easily dismissed as we know the reason or that's no longer a necessary structure just because it doesn't fit into our tank and so you don't really want to approach biology and physiology and anatomy with that heavy bias that the way humans are doing it right now in La is really an indication of what humans need to be doing. Oh, people have a natural instinct to suck on wounds. Hundred cut your finger. You naturally do that and then people would tell you not to do that for the longest time, but then they found out the notes alive as actually very strong healing properties like we have an instinct to suck on wounds because it actually does help.

Speaker 4:          02:30:48       Yeah. It's just like that. It's just part of the part of the reflexes that we come with that have kept us alive for so long. Uncomfortable. Question number two, do you guys have toilets? We do regular old toilets platforms around platforms around. There were regular toilets. Yeah. And the squad platform. What do you build that? Well, you can build it, buy it, and is bought a squatty potty and you just throw it up and

Speaker 6:          02:31:16       you don't make loud noises when someone drops.

Speaker 4:          02:31:18       No doesn't because the height,

Speaker 1:          02:31:20       you mean your butts at the same altitude. You can. You can actually just still sit on the toilet and just put your feet up. So your hips and knees are just a different angle. You don't even have to work any muscles differently. Don't actually have a squatty potty. Can do that. Any person sit down and you put your feet up. Just take like if you have a stack of books or if you have like a wastepaper basket is flip it over and put your feet up on it. Just get your hips and your knees to a different, um, joint angle because it turns out again that the tubes of, of elimination line up better when you do the other, that it's part of the system and without that then you have to start bearing down and adding forces into the system that aren't so good for. They're good to accomplish that task, but they're not good for maybe the whole structure like that. All that intra abdominal pressure over time, if that's how you're forcing it to get out moves things and other ways. Like when you have to poop in the woods, it comes out real quick. Whereas like if you're sitting down a toilet, it's like sometimes you can read a book or go answer a few tweets. It takes awhile because you have to work against the technology of a toilet. That's interesting.

Speaker 4:          02:32:33       How did we get into the toilets then? What? Where did that come along? Women from toilet. That was just uncomfortable. Question number two, how did we as human beings, how did we get to this, this throne that you sit down on? How come nobody figured out that a long time ago? Well, I think that with civilization, part of another inherent component of civilization that you have to be better than someone else, you know, and so a lot of the things that we do, um, our, our, our ways of delineating ourselves from sap, what we would call savages are more primitive people like your shoes. You didn't want your skin to be too dark or Tan, you know, you wanted to show that you had more affluence that you weren't as barbaric. You didn't have to poop on it, you could just poop it and push it flush or, and it went away. And like it just, it just comes soft hands, cultured demeanor. You were less animal if you were less animal. Correct. You're trying to be more animal. Uh, but the word is primitive. I am a primate.

Speaker 1:          02:33:34       Yeah.

Speaker 4:          02:33:36       What advancements the society make that you think has society made that you think are beneficial? Well, gosh man, I think medicine is benefit. I mean, I think everything is beneficial. It's just that what I'm more concerned about is what's, what has been, what is no longer needed that is still essential. So it's, it's, it's, I don't, I don't have really an aversion against civilization and technology. It's just that vitamin C is still necessary, like we can't get around the fact that vitamin C is still necessary. So I'm just trying to figure out diseases. So when you're trying to figure out diseases you have to kind of boil down to could this be a rising because of some not and input some essential input that we're not getting. And so as people get more and more advanced than our, our health again in the terms of biological sense isn't getting better with us. And so what happens to a species that advances itself right out of being a species, you know, like that. That's more what I'm, I'm interested in. So I like it all. I like all technology. Netflix, Netflix might be my favorite technology.

Speaker 5:          02:34:51       It just seems to me that you, you're, you're in this really weird state of, of sort of primitive re-engineering. I don't want to like, uh, our primate re-engineering. I mean, that's, that seems like what you're doing, like you're, you're looking at all the various various components of society that you feel like are non beneficial. You're eliminating them and you're, you're doing it from the jump with your children. I find that very fascinating.

Speaker 4:          02:35:20       Yeah. Well, I mean it's a bed, like the things sound radical, but again, as far as humans on the planet right now, they're really not so they might be more, they might be more radical because are decidedly non American, but I don't think I'm really going out of my way that much to be more animal. Like it's just like I don't feel my life is enhanced with a bed.

Speaker 4:          02:35:45       I don't think my life is enhanced with like I'm obviously letting go the things that I can't live without. There are certain things that, that I know I still have a car. I some weird thing that you said in your car and you sit on a lot. I just want to sit as little as possible in it. I try to walk as many places as I can sit in a weird way or anything I'll sit across. I mean, I'll sit in as many different ways in the car as long as I hit the gas and the pedal with your left foot. No, no, I don't play around with that kind of stuff. Now that can be dangerous. Right? That'd be weird. Like sensory input is huge. You're driving, you're using a lot of motor memory when you're driving. I don't know if I would start playing around with that kind of stuff.

Speaker 5:          02:36:29       Yeah. I've used my left foot to break sometimes and it's amazing how dumb my left foot is like my right foot is. Ooh. It's so like, it's interesting that we figured out a way to use the foot for input, you know, and the other thing you find out is that your left foot gets tired if you were to try to drive the gas. We left, but like I hurt my right knee once and I was driving with my left foot. Your left foot gets tired. It gets tired. Just pressing down on the gas pedal. It's makes you think like what? What muscles are being programmed by my right foot that are not being programmed by my left. Like there's a lot of things that I do really good with my right side. I don't do so good with my left side. Yeah, it's weird. So yeah, hold the bag. That's a big one. Throw kicks is another one that certain kicks I just don't do as well with my left side. And the. It's just. I wonder now,

Speaker 6:          02:37:16       especially after talking to you like what other chains of things are not working as well because of that in balance.

Speaker 2:          02:37:25       Yeah. Well I think for me that brings up that notion of alignment is an alignment is when you're moving, you know, alignment in your, in your car is like when you're, when the relationship of all of the parts are where they should be, and then the way that you drive optimizes the longevity of the structure of the car as a whole. Like you don't like, you don't have anyone. We'll getting its job done as a wheel is wearing down the break on that side where it's costing you something that it shouldn't. So it's the same thing with the body, you're trying to figure out your alignment, which is how can I be using my arm without

Speaker 2:          02:38:04       wearing down my shoulder prematurely because the muscles between the two are tighter than they should be because I always do the same thing with my left arm. So I think it's less about. I mean muscle balancing is one way to look at it, but also just look at what are the movements you do in your life. Like if you had to make a list of the top 10 moves you do in your life outside of your exercise program, like what are they? It's sitting from like getting up and down out of chairs is a thing that you do most often, but we don't do very much with our body at all. When it's not exercising almost nothing. What kind of exercise do you do?

Speaker 2:          02:38:43       No, none. None really in that I have really eliminated structured exercise time out of my life, but if you plotted my body on a graph, what you would see is probably five miles of walking a day almost carrying something. Almost always while doing that, but you know, it's in different arms all of the time. I'm working, you know, working on the house. My stillness is on the computer time, but really it's just that getting up and down off of the floor, sitting on the floor in different ways, which would, which would look like stretching I would say to most people. Right. So I'm always working on some sort of stretch, but it's really just to get something accomplished.

Speaker 6:          02:39:28       So no lifting weights, no squatting, no.

Speaker 2:          02:39:32       Well I circled lifts, squat because I don't have furniture, so I probably do 200 squats a day, but I don't do them repetitively. They're distributed throughout the day and they're held sometimes for three or four minutes while I'm doing something. So I would say that my moves, if you, if you loaded up my moves and put them in, it wouldn't look that much different than a workout probably. It would probably look most like, like a cross, like a crossfit kind of workout, you know? Um, as far as you know, the variation of moves and my kids are heavy. So like you're them around and moving them around, but it would, it would just, it just looked like regular living,

Speaker 6:          02:40:19       never exhausted and never breathing heavy. You never had a rapid heart rate. So your cardiovascular improvement from something like that is probably pretty minimal, right?

Speaker 2:          02:40:27       Well, I mean, but I also go out like. So we're actually going out and hiking. So if you go out and hike a couple miles again, carrying or hurting kids like it does stay. Yeah. You do. Like your heart rate is elevated. I still practice recovery. You know, again, one of the reasons you do cardio, you do cardio because this idea that you want to keep your heart strong enough to do what it's supposed to be, to distribute oxygen. Your cardiovascular system distributes oxygen, but just because it's beating faster, working harder is not accomplishing whole body oxygen distribution. In fact, it's pulling blood away from anything, not doing that thing that you're doing in the moment. So even that idea of cardio comes from being still all the time. What can I consume in a short period of time that keeps my heart muscles strong instead of going, how can I take the resistance away from my heart and distribute my oxygen all the time, like my cardiovascular system is working all the time because I'm moving all the time.

Speaker 6:          02:41:30       I think what we're talking about, two different things. I'm talking about like what you're trying to accomplish, whether or not you're trying to push your body to an optimum state, have you look into optimize your body's performance. You really not going to get that just by caring kids doing, you know, sitting down on the ground like your, your body, like the difference between exercise. A lot of people are thinking of exercise as being something where, uh, I guess you're just trying to lose a little weight or stay active or sweat a little bit. What I'm talking about is optimizing your physical body, like strengthening your body, strengthening your cardiovascular system, strengthening your physical structure. Like A, I'm a big believer in especially resistance exercises. I think that it's very important for bone density. It's very important to resist the aging process and muscles. Keeping muscle density, keeping bone density like you're not doing anything like that.

Speaker 2:          02:42:26       Well, again, I think it's about how you're using the word optimization optimization. To me, if you're optimizing the fitness performance tests like one rep Max or or a strength goal, whether it's a static or physics perform like a physical performance, like how much weight can I move with his body part and can I get more and more? That's fine as long as your body is also being successful at getting biological tasks done and I think that in a lot of cases people can have very high levels of this fitness optimization for performance for athletic performance, but not be performing hundred percent biologically

Speaker 4:          02:43:12       speaking. How so? Well, I think of like. I think if like I in the book I use cycling as an example where you can have people who have huge vo, two Max capacity because they're training, they're doing a ton of endurance training, but the bone density in their hips and most competitive cyclists is lower than what it should be like. They actually have like the hips have of a 70 year old woman with osteoporosis because they're not carrying any weight because they've. They've isolated the variable that they're training for. Bone density is not necessary, but it's a waste actually have bone density, so there's a lot of health tradeoffs that occur when we train for performance without keeping our eye constantly on biology. So I would say that my bone and see the bone density of, of hunter gatherer populations is way higher than it is in even like heavy lifters because bone density is a whole head to toe phenomenon and and you know like people who have warned sues their entire time, like the bone density and their feet is pretty low.

Speaker 4:          02:44:20       Like the size and shape of your bones is small already. Even if you do a lot with it, that, that the size and the shape is, is, is limited by the fact that you don't move all the time. Even though you do a ton of work to optimize your fitness level in that hour, you're sedentary 96 percent of the time so that the physical cap optimization, it's just different. It's just different. It's just a different set of variables by which to assess yourself, but they're not mutually exclusive or not. Someone could be doing everything that you're doing and also lift weights and improve their guns, but I think you can be too strong. Like I think that some of you can be too tight, so get in the birthing community. There's this, there's this thing of, you know, why are women who I'm doing a lot of exercise, their muscles get to the point where the tension, the resting tension is higher than what it should be like saying their pelvic floor and then they're having to generate way more force or their tissues will tear or give because the tension is greater than what is natural because you can.

Speaker 4:          02:45:30       Because you can get stronger and stronger and stronger. But at what point is your attention higher than natural? Because of the context of doing nothing else. The rest of the time, like I will carry our kids, but then there's like huge, like very fit guy and he came up to us like if I had to carry my kids, there's no way. My back had tolerated it for more than 20 minutes and I've been following you guys around all day and you've had these kids for hours. He's like, I can't. I couldn't even do it. So who's stronger? No terrorists. Kids for 20 minutes. That's ridiculous. It was back. I mean he was, he was, he worked out a lot, but he obviously had some sort of weak leak in a system like and of course you can mitigate

Speaker 2:          02:46:10       that right by better training practices,

Speaker 6:          02:46:12       but the thing is a bad example because I think anyone can overload their system and an unnatural way and then that's a huge issue with weightlifting, especially with people do isolation exercises. I'm a big proponent of functional strength exercises like full body weight x or full body movements and things along those lines and that's something that for a long time people just weren't even aware of this, this, this sort of crossfit type Olympic body lift body weight or Olympic lifting style, a full body exercise thing. That's like fairly recent as far as trends. For the longest time everybody was doing like preacher curls, which are just ridiculous, you know?

Speaker 2:          02:46:54       Yeah, there was, it's, it's, it has come in the last 10 years to a whole different level of functional, so I think I'm just calling for it to become even more functional, like real functional, like stuff that you would actually do in life.

Speaker 6:          02:47:08       Yeah, I mean I'm, I'm fascinated by your approach, but I just wonder how Ab, how practical it would be for the average person. You seem to have engineered your life in order to do it this way and it's great. It's wonderful, but I just wonder how many other people could sort of apply that to their lives unless they had some sort of a mean. You have to have a lot of freedom to do what you're doing, you know, what does your husband do?

Speaker 2:          02:47:32       Do you have a job that works with you? We've just run our company from online, you know, it's, I have a podcast and the blog and write books and stuff. As your podcast Katie says, Katie says, so just talks about this kind of stuff. Breaking it down though and in, in much smaller bites. So yeah, we were very fortunate. We worked hard to get to this point though, were just managing me and and what I, what I produce and speaking do lesbian.

Speaker 6:          02:48:03       So he's like sort of like a manager or a coworker with you and sort of helps you along with what you're doing? Yeah,

Speaker 2:          02:48:10       we're both also raising the kids. Right. So we're like, we're sharing so there's just like, you're just constantly jumping in and tagging in, tagging out and in taking turns working at night and someone works at early in the morning and just getting all the things done that need to. He used to do. He used you guys became the grizzly Adams family. He was an editor, like a, like a magazine article editor sees a copy editor and a lot of just kind of a jack of all trades just writing. So it's helped me out. Producing, writing, yes.

Speaker 6:          02:48:38       Oh, I bet that sitting down writing all this, he's probably really aware of what you're talking about and the issues that people that do that kind of thing face I was probably attractive to him to sort of pursue what you're advocating.

Speaker 2:          02:48:50       Yeah. What, and it's funny because he was actually, he was total a barefoot guy, you know, you know, just now I didn't know this about him when he was in college here in La. He's Kinda, he's Kinda like the big Lebowski. My husband is very similar to if you know who the character of the big Lebowski is, he's Kinda like, it's Kinda like that guys, like the dude is just kind of a cool kind of hang out Kinda guy. And, and he was barefoot like in a bathrobe a lot of the time. So he was already had this barefoot component and then he worked in New York City, you know, barefoot in a bathrobe. I think a lot of the time getting an ingredients for his white Russians.

Speaker 6:          02:49:25       Like the big Lebowski, like the dude from big Lebowski rights is the dude. He's like the dude. He's a stoner then. Yeah. Yeah. That's a good place for you to be the Pacific northwest. It's a good place for stoners. It's right here. It's everywhere up there. It's grown wild Washington man. Yeah. Well, Washington is one of the few states that had the courage to make it legal sounds Oregon now and some couple other places is going to become legal too. Um, I think what you're doing is really fascinating. I, like I said, I just wonder how many people could actually apply it to their life, but I think it's really cool that you're doing it. I think it's really cool that you're a sort of documenting it and explain it. And do you talk about this kind of stuff a lot? And Katie says,

Speaker 2:          02:50:06       I do. I do. People have questions. I think their questions are like, how do I, how do I do it? You know, some people tweet me their pictures of like here's, here's me sitting on the floor in front of my couch. You know, the couch is still there, but they're just sitting on the floor and fun of it. Or we have indoor monkey bars, so they're. So that even if we're inside, you know, the kids can still train, we can all train. So they just kind of go down the kitchen. Yeah, you guys are freaks. But. So are lots of other people now.

Speaker 6:          02:50:37       Yeah. Listen, people come over my house. I think I'm a freak too. I mean, we're all freaks in our own little weird way. Sure. But I think you were. Freakiness is a very healthy and I'm conscientious freakiness and they'd say it's pretty. Obviously you're thinking this is not just something, you're just jumping into this. You put a great deal of thought into this. Yeah. Um, what kind of criticisms do you get? I mean, I'm sure you must get criticisms because the anti anti anti-vaccine. Well, none. Not even your anti-vaccination yeah. The fact that you have not yet vaccinated your kids.

Speaker 2:          02:51:04       Well, I don't know. It's the first time I ever told anyone publicly than I don't. Yeah. No one's ever asked me before. I'm not anti. I'm not an anti. I'm not an anti vaccinator. I believe in, in vaccines. I just, I've just, there's, there's just a timeline like I am. I at what I didn't do as do early, you know, vaccines. I have a lot of. I work with a lot of people in medicine, a lot of people on a regular basis. And so I just have the way that I'm doing it, but um, yeah, I guess it is a big,

Speaker 6:          02:51:37       that's a hot topic. It is a hot topic. It's a hot topic in terms of criticism as well. People love to jump on people that aren't vaccinating their kids or jump in. Anyone who's trying to connect any vaccinations towards any sort of ailments and diseases. And you know, I, I've talked to many doctors and that are pro vaccine that think that the protocols that we instill as far as like everyone being subscribed to the same, like this is probably not the best way to deal with anything biological because people have so much bio diversity. There's so much difference between one thing that will make someone terribly ill and the same exact substance, one effect someone at all, whether it's allergies or sensitivities to certain medications. And it's just you're going to run the risk, especially when you're, you're introducing a lot of chemicals into a very young immune system. A very young child.

Speaker 2:          02:52:33       Yeah, I mean I, I, I would agree there's a, there's a timing. There was a timing issue for us in the way that we wanted to do it. Um, I don't think. I'm not really even a, I don't really believe that the vaccinations are tied to any ailment or anything. Like that's not, that's not my bag at all. It's just more like there is like, I think it's a load I think of just a load to the body as a whole and watching I'm wanting my children to process and develop certain things first where you know, the risk of, of any overload or mismatch as you call it. Like in terms of biology and medicine where it's just less of a less of a new new thing, you know, the structure is a little bit more, more formed and more able to process anything that you put into it.

Speaker 6:          02:53:27       It seems like there's an issue with, um, some parents where some parents want to criticize people that are raising their kids in a different way and they do it for either because they don't like the way it makes them examined, the way they're raising their kids. So they get, they do it defensively or they're judgmental or you know that everybody thinks they're doing it the right way and then everybody else is doing it the wrong way. Do you face a lot of that? Because this is a very unconventional way of raising children?

Speaker 2:          02:53:53       It is. And that's I think out of all the. If I got any criticisms it would be for, for that, for the way that we want to raise our kids and I, and I don't have any problem with the way that anyone wants to raise her kids. Like this is just what we're, this is just what we're doing and this is what we're trying. I just happened to be in a more public format and I'm writing about it. I mean I'm, I'm making. There's very conscious biomechanical choices of why I'm doing what I'm doing. Like I got to go, here's the process of mechanotransduction and here's the list of diseases and here's, here's the known environments. And so here's the environments that we're changing. So in that way it's kind of like a, an experiment in, in current process, right? That we're, that we're doing. But yeah, it's, I think the worst thing I was ever called by someone, you know, in a comment section and I don't spend. I spent almost zero time reading comments or whatever. It's not my sound. My thing is smart. Yeah. I was just like, I feel like the quality of interaction isn't someone who is really wanting to have a thoughtful discussion with me to.

Speaker 6:          02:55:00       Unless you really. I mean it's, it's hard to manage those things too if you can. No one wants censorship, but you've got to eliminate assholes. You know? It's not like censorship as far as the way the ideas are expressed or the ideas themselves. It's the way they're expressed in the insulting manner in which people can do it anonymously. If there was some reason to not. If there's some way to not have it be anonymous and that you would see, then all of a sudden you're interacting with some person and what's lacking is a social cue. So there's things that people will tell you things in online that they would never tell you, just looking at you in front of you. And if they did, they would be completely socially retarded to do that. But just it's, there's no consequences. Just typing something shitty. And the one thing that you can glean that you can get from that is that all those people were socially retarded.

Speaker 6:          02:55:51       Anyone who does that like, okay, you're input is, it's not valid because your input like this insulting thing that you've written, you've written that because you're an idiot. Like that's it. That's the only reason why you do it. If you're a sensitive person or if you're a person that considers that person, the other analyst I person, obviously he's doing something horribly racist or sexist or whatever, you know, whatever. In some way that victimizes other people, you're just talking about someone's opinions and ideas and doing so in a very insulting way. You're doing so because you're an emotionally stunted fuckhead. I'm like, that's what you are. And so that's why you're. That's why you're drawn to this anonymous contribution in the first place. Whereas the ver, the large majority of people and they watch a youtube video will not leave a comment, right? The large majority and the people that do the overwhelming number of negative comments like it's represents way more than I think the average population because you're dealing with a sort of a stunted group in the first place.

Speaker 6:          02:56:44       I think you're already. There's already a certain type of person who will comment so you're not looking at. You're not looking at a good cross section of humanity. I don't think when you're looking at youtube comments like I have a message board and it's, it's amazing that mean had, I've had it since 1998 and that there's always going to be assholes. There's a certain amount of assholes, so you just going to get a certain amount. People, they just want attention so they just want to be shitty and insulting. But the intelligent discussions that the large majority have intelligent discussions and an interesting different viewpoints. And once people get away from this idea of just a demanding attention by just being just shitty, which is what a lot of people do in these social network forums, whether it's twitter or facebook, they get more attention by being shitty.

Speaker 6:          02:57:32       Uh, but once you get past that, like you can find communities, you can cultivate communities, but it's hard to do without some form of regulation when you regulate your sensor. And so it becomes like, you know, what's going on in France right now, of course, right with the, this, this, uh, cartoonists, uh, these people that were killed, well now Francis arrested like 60 people for making facebook posts that they thought were either in, in support of terrorism or criticizing their government. They re arrested a comedian recently for some, some comment that he's made about the relationship between terrorism and this, this, this, this horrible tragedy. It's really kind of fucked up because it's like, it's Kinda counterintuitive to the whole idea that you're supposed to be supporting in the first place. But the, the communities that we have online right now, I think a big part of it is they don't feel the interaction.

Speaker 6:          02:58:30       They just send it out there, almost like a message in the bottle. And you were on the other hand receiving. Do you read all your, a lot of your comments on your board still? I read a lot of the comments on the board. I read a lot of comments on twitter. I still interact with people, but it's like I. I believe it's like snake venom like you get if you just get bitten by a snake and never been bitten before, you kind of fucked. But if you get snake venom all the time, you go, oh, I know what that is. Some fucking Weirdo. That's a good way to say it. You could feel the. I know I have a very kind kind of group of people who read and follow him. Tweet at. Very rarely do I get, you know, the kind of person, but you occasionally get mean people.

Speaker 6:          02:59:05       I mean the biggest one was someone who said that I was racist. I was raising my children is colonialists and because I didn't have furniture, Linda, you don't even want to sit down. You sit in your own culture, furniture and stuff like sit in your own cultures, furniture, plantation furniture. It was such a random irritation for this person, so can't read that. No. Katy Bowman, you're awesome. I really enjoyed this conversation. There's a lot of fun. Thank you. Very educational. I learned a lot from this.
