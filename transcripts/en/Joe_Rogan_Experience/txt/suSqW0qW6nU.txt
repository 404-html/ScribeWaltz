Speaker 1:          00:00:00       I think that would pan out. I had a similar idea.

Speaker 1:          00:00:07       Anthony Kumina were alive, sir. I love it. Joe Rogan. If it was not for you, oh my God, this, this would not exist. Which is insane. That is 100 percent actual fact. I was watching you doing live from the compound. Me and Brian Red Band. We're sitting in my fucking living room and we were watching you while you were fucking playing karaoke. You're singing karaoke with a machine gun in front of a green screen. I was like, this guy, this guy just set up his own studio like he already has opie and Anthony show at the time. You guys were at Sirius Xm and he just decided to do this thing in your basement just for a goof. Yeah, it was like a hobby, but it's like guys who don't have kids, married, not married, don't have kids, so I don't have anybody telling them what to do and they also have disposable income.

Speaker 1:          00:00:52       Then you get to see what guys really want to do. They want to sing karaoke with a machine gun in front of a green screen. Yeah. It was crazy, crazy gun Guy Karaoke, so I could do that. If if I was married, I would have a wife that would lose her mind at my living room, my living room table that you're supposed to have a candle on and little chotchkies and stuff is a wide screen, a computer monitor and a gaming system right next to the table. I have a gaming computer that's just unbelievable. And I sit there and just play video games. So the table itself is a gaming monitor? Yeah. The whole tape. Well it is one of those touch screen ones. No, it's a, it's a giant wide monitor. It's like a, like 40 inches wide. So that's the table. No, it's on the table.

Speaker 1:          00:01:38       The table's big heavy metal thing, but. But it's just everything. There's vr goggles up on the console by the TV. It's just sensors around the room for the VR. It's a playground and you're absolutely right. Guys will spend their money on having fun if, if allowed to. That's what this place, this place is insane in my house. You go to my house, it's my wife's house. Say That's how it works. Have one elk head on the wall. That's all I have. That's all you're allowed. I laugh at guys when they have the, uh, the man cave, like, dude, come on down to the man cave. The chicks aren't allowed down here. I got this, the TV that. And I'm like, no, you should replace is the whole house. She relegated you to one room echo and you're happy about it. You're happy that you got one room.

Speaker 1:          00:02:24       Happy wife. Happy life. That's apparently it didn't work. It didn't work for me. You know the thoreau quote that I say way too many times in this podcast, but I love the quote. Most men live lives of silent desperation. Wow. Yeah, that is true. It's a hundred percent true. It was, uh, I was married for time and it was a, it was a nightmare. It was a living hell for me. The only thing that got me through as many years as I was married, because I was married nine years and I don't remember one happy year out of those nine, but I had gotten into radio pretty early on in that marriage. Um, and that was my life. So I dedicated myself no matter how miserable anything else in my life was. I was doing radio. So I, I thought it was awesome. I have a theory about that.

Speaker 1:          00:03:13       I really do. I think that a person needs a certain amount of suffering in their life. And if you look at some of the all time, great comics or even all time great radio personalities like Howard Stern, Howard Stern, during his hay day when he was, the fucking man was miserable. Right? Right. He would talk about it. He would hide in his basement. I love those stories. Here's this guy. He's the, you know, the biggest radio personality ever. He's, he's huge. And yet he's got to hide and he's just talking about masturbating and hiding from his wife and he can't get any sex. And you're like, it didn't matter if he was huge, didn't matter if he was famous, didn't matter how rich he was, didn't matter. He's just hide in the basement. And that anger came out on the radio like you related to him. You understood it.

Speaker 1:          00:04:00       Yeah. Yeah. I, I, I get that. Um, and it worked for me because there was a lot of misery. Like when I started doing really well, we moved back to New York from Boston after we got fired. Oh, opiod myself. You guys got fired for saying that the mayor died? Yeah, it was an April fool's gag and a. because we always thought that the radio, April fool's jokes was so stupid and Hokey and uh, yeah, we changed the format to all elvis and it's like after 10 minutes they say April fools. So we're like, let's just go balls out and say the mayor's dead and have a news guy come on and report it and everything. And then it was supposed to subsequently get more outrageous as the, uh, the, the show went on. So by the end of it, there was a Taiwan male hooker in the car with them and they crashed because he was getting a blow job or so, like it was going to get really ridiculous, but they stopped it early on and never allowed us to even mention it.

Speaker 1:          00:05:00       So people really thought he died. Although it's kind of stupid. You go to the one show for your news, but back then the internet wasn't what it is now. Exactly. Yeah. It was the inner, the inner wasn't even, it was barely a thing. It was barely a thing. Uh, because that was 90, 97 around there. Ninety eight. What year did you get on? You'll probably earlier I was on really early, like the eighties. I was on bulletin board service. Uh, and uh, we used to play Trivia Games with a 300 Baud Modem with people and I thought it was amazing even then. And then in, in the, uh, when we were up in Boston, I bought a digital camera that was just this giant thing. And I had a laptop and other giant thing and I would take pictures of what was going on in the studio and then post them that night on a website that I figured out I used to code the html myself and make a website, just post pictures and links and people thought it was amazing.

Speaker 1:          00:06:00       Like you're seeing what we talked about that day. Uh, it wasn't instant, but it was pretty cool. And then I started doing videos. I was able to put video like maybe eight second clips of nude girls if they were in the studio and pop that up and people loved it. Uh, and then I got a bill from the company for bandwidth and I didn't know bandwidth. It was a $12,000 bill for a month. Yeah. Yeah, because I, there was no, there was no compression or anything. I'm pumping video out to thousands of people uncompressed. And uh, apparently they had that happen a couple of times. So they told me just don't do it again. They didn't make me pay, which was pretty cool. But at that point I had to learn about, you know, coding and a compression and things like that. So you just kept doing it and just put them in some sort of a compressed format.

Speaker 1:          00:06:54       Did you, uh, would you use, do you remember back then? Oh God, I think it was like a for audio. It was real audio, which was hilarious. Right. The little player, real, real audio player would pop up. And then for video got, I can't even remember what it was, but it was terrible. It was all pixilated, you know, like 10 frames per minute, kind of weird things like real audio, which was everywhere. They just quit, gave up around still unless they changed into something else, you know, or kind kinda got bought out by somebody. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's happens to everything. But honestly, if it was not for you and your show live from the competent and for, for opiod. Hilarious. Because opie and Anthony was the first radio show that I re what are wherever realize you don't really have to have a format.

Speaker 1:          00:07:40       Yeah. You can just talk. Yeah. It was just kind of a, a talk thing. There was a hang, it was a hang and a lot of the uh, we, we were on the same. It was the same company as Howard Stern, CBS radio. Oh, look at that real still here. It says it makes stories from your videos and photos now. But this is exactly what it is. It's real. It's a real player. Automatically makes videos. Stories from your best photos. Sorry, cut you off there. I know. It's like a kind of montage automatic to for the. Yeah. Yeah. Used to be a good way to watch porn with Weird Codex Codex when porn had a weird codex, you know, like woo. Fucking who compiled this? You'd get it. You'd watch it on real player. Get porn from bit torrent. Yeah. Yeah. And then sometimes you wouldn't have anything on your computer to play.

Speaker 1:          00:08:32       It was say a Codec not available. Yeah, exactly. Pissed off because he liked to find they'll fuck. Yeah. No, that thumbnail was awesome. I got to see. I remember the first time I ever got a porn video sent to me. I was like, this is crazy. Yeah. Yeah. Watch a porn video. Before it was just photos, the photos were insane because, uh, I guess it was around the mid nineties. My brother had picked up a, uh, an apple computer. I don't even know what model it was or anything, but it was, uh, it was pretty good for the time. And uh, I just sat in front of that thing for hours and hours on end. Just one porn pick. It was no videos, just pictures and you know, how they used to scroll sometimes it was a corrupt file, so halfway down it would just turn white and pixelated and zigzaggy.

Speaker 1:          00:09:24       But uh, just for hours, just one more, one more, one more and just go tick, tick, tick, tick, tick. It would slowly emerged. It was very, a very compelling. Yeah. You'd sit there and just waiting for the three d printer is faster now than it was downloading photos on a 14 k modem. Yeah. Yeah. It's insane to think of the technology end of it because you got thumb drives with more memory than entire computers had just a few years ago. Uh, and, and I remember, I guess it was Bill Gates or something, said you'll, you'll never need anything more powerful than a for 86 years ago. And it's like, what, a couple of megs of memory and uh, just crazy the, the demand for, for a computer power got way out of hand and especially with games and stuff because I'm a huge gaming got now you download a game, like a red dead redemption, two or call of duty and it's 75 to 100 gigs.

Speaker 1:          00:10:27       Really. Those games. Yeah. And it's like, that would, that would have been 100 computers. And to think of those floppy discs you used to get games on, it would have been a pallet stacked up like six feet high of those discs to load it on a computer. So I'm like the old doom games. Yeah, yeah, yeah. With the. Yeah. You just make those sounds and hopefully it would work. And uh, yeah. Now you just download them. I haven't been to a gaming store in years because with the origin or steam, you just download the game right off of your, uh, offline redemption to you just download it. You just download it. Like, I don't know who goes to gamestop or anything anymore.

Speaker 2:          00:11:07       I mean there's one in the mall I've seen. Yeah, I've seen it. I don't know. Maybe if we used games. Yeah. Xbox and playstation. Xbox you could download to, right? Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. And playstation. Yeah. You just plugged the cat six or whatever it was. And was having a conversation with Jordan Peterson about this yesterday off air. I was saying I'm really, I get concerned because I feel like all of our information, like the vast majority of it is now digital and we have some things that are written down on paper, but even paper so it's so easy to break and burn and fuck up. I mean, we lost most of human beings loss most of the information about Egypt when they burned the library of Alexandria, who knows? I mean, there could have been all sorts of schematics and some diagrams,

Speaker 3:          00:11:54       detailed diagrams, how they built some of the things they built, lost it all, you know, that easily could happen to us. And then we'll be starting from scratch again.

Speaker 1:          00:12:00       Yeah. The, uh, when, when it takes some form of electricity to, to get to all this information, you're really dependent on that. There's going to be power, that type of power of forever.

Speaker 3:          00:12:15       And even if we figured out how to reboot electricity and say some day in the future, what if we have a massive coronal mass ejection and it fucking nukes the entire, the whole grid and all the satellites go down and we have to start from scratch. So it's a decade, two decades before people start rebuilding computers again. That actually work well. They're going to have to decipher all this information. They're going to have to figure out those codex. They're going to have to figure out, yeah, they're going to get drivers to make all this stuff work. And you're gonna miss a lot of it.

Speaker 1:          00:12:45       Yeah. All the info is literally ones and Zeros and it has to be decoded and put back together again

Speaker 3:          00:12:51       and some important stuff. If it's on a drive somewhere, it could just get nuked. Yeah, it's gone. It's gone forever. All the things that people figured out gone.

Speaker 1:          00:13:02       Don't you wish that would happen at some? I don't know. I'm so cynical, man. I really have lately more so. I, I think over the course of the past few years I've just gotten more cynical and uh, I think social media had a big effect on me. Well, you engaged too much. Yes, I did. I'm off social media now. I have been for, for maybe months at least, you know, as a personal choice. Well, the twitter kicked me off quite a few times, but they kick you off just dumb shit to. It wasn't even. It wasn't even that bad. Like wow. The last one, it was a, I was defending Jimmy Norton. Some girl was on just bashing Jimmy and uh, and I was like, look at you. I go, I don't even know what you are. First of all, you're either a masculine girl or a feminine guy and your hair looks like it was dyed with period blood because she has to, and both at God they fucking permanently suspended me.

Speaker 1:          00:14:06       That was the back. Was it bloods period. Blood. You can't make fun of that. You can't make fun of somebody says looks if the sexuality. I kind of called him a a fam, uh, or, or a butch, whatever. It was never whichever case, whichever case. And to this day I still don't know actually, but uh, so I get kicked off a lot. I have a twitter account now, but I have not told anybody what the name is because I just use it for research for the show because a twitter gets the news before the news. Like that's where everything breaks now on twitter. You know what's interesting to me, Louis? Fair. Still twitter. It, it's, it's amazing. You have a read. Some of the Shitty says evil Jews. Crazy. Antisemetic believable, unbelievable. And for whatever reason they're scared to kicking him off. Yeah, they won't kick him off.

Speaker 1:          00:14:56       I guess a Laura loomer is a Jewish kind of independent reporter girl, and a nutcase slash nutcase, whatever. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Whatever you want to change or something. She changed herself to twitter. Yes. Hilarious. I just watched it on periscope as it was going on and she's got a bull horn and she's just yelling, uh, at twitter as a bull horn, you know, it's funny. It's kind of left wing tactics she was using because conservatives, the right Republicans, whatever you want to call are pretty mellow when it comes to they don't demonstrate really. They like to just get in there and do their shit, whatever it is. Uh, but liberals really like getting out there and marching and yelling and bull horns and stuff like that. So it was weird, like to see that on the other end. Uh, but she, she just screaming and uh, I guess I guess they unhooked her and uh, and arrested ourselves.

Speaker 1:          00:15:56       Ready? What did they, what did they kick her off at twitter for? They kicked her off. We're talking about Islam and talking about how twitter was celebrating a women's Day, whatever, whatever. That was a on a certain day by focusing like the picture was one of those, uh, Islamic women that got elected to office up in, what was it, Minnesota or somewhere, so she said how hypocritical that was because, you know, Islam is for female genital mutilation and, uh, against women's rights and they kill gay people and, and that's all she posted and she got kicked off for hate speech against Islam. And then her argument was Louis Farrakhan was saying, you know, I'm not an anti Semite, I'm an anteater, might equating Jews with insects, which is pretty 19 thirties, jeremy kind of a thing. So, uh, you know, while her heart was in the right place, I guess it did come off a little wacky.

Speaker 1:          00:16:55       She also had a star of David, a yellow star of David on her shirt, uh, as she was chained to twitter and people got upset with that. Ah, there she is. I just thought, to tell you the truth, I thought it was a good strategic move because you're going to buy time with that because the police do not want that optic of a uniformed guy kind of pulling a girl off. They're wearing a star of David. They could just picture looks bad. So it might've bought her some time, but I don't know if that was her motive. She planned it out. Well, she did. Apparently it was the number one trending topic on twitter, which is odd that you know, she gets kicked off and ends up being the number one trending topic. What's really odd is this is while Manafort who may have perjured himself yours going after trump's deeper ties. Cohen is now saying that trump was in cahoots with Putin. He was going

Speaker 2:          00:17:50       to give them the $50,000,000 penthouse tower in Moscow. You know, all that. But like, no, no, no. That girl got kicked off, pick up to it. It sounds ridiculous because I got, like I said, I got kicked off and I'm, I'm

Speaker 1:          00:18:04       a little bummed about it. Uh, but uh, it's why, because it's odd. It's not just a private company anymore that can do what they want. I'm not free government regulation, so I don't know how you fix this, but twitter is now a thing where the presidents on it, we're leaders are discussing things on it, emergency management, fema and the weather services. They put out alerts in case of a danger or or some kind of event that's going to happen and because of your political ideology or calling a girl period, blood hair, you're not privy to alerts and safety information that

Speaker 2:          00:18:43       well, it's. It's clear that it's not. Everyone's doesn't have to follow the same rules. We've already established that with Farah Khan. We've also established that with trump. Sam Harris has been on a. He was, at least, I think he's abandoned it, but it was on a quest to get jack to try to hold up his terms of service agreement and kick trump off of twitter. I was like, look what he's doing. He's threatening nuclear war. Do you understand that? This is the craziest use of twitter ever? Yeah, and I think Jack's position was that. It is. It's more beneficial to have him on and it's really, we're getting to see his personality in a way we've never seen any president's personal. Absolutely mean the, the most ridiculous petty shit that he does, like attacking Michelle Wolf because of her White House correspondents dinner. You, Colin people losers, you know, making fun of the girl on Joe Scarborough, the girl he married.

Speaker 2:          00:19:38       Yeah. Yeah. That she had fucked up plastic surgery. Her bleeding just make shit up. I mean, do you think she really, really thinks she showed up? Uh, Maro Lago, bleeding fucking plastic surgeries. He's a fucking maniac. It really is. But meanwhile that, it, it, it, it's good for us to see because it educates us to who he is as a real person. There's a lot of who you are just gets exposed in those tweets. We little bit. You can't know everything about a person from their twitter, but you can get, you can parse out little chunks where you get a good taste. And for him it's very, very revealing. Yeah, it is a weird thing. This is what I think this will be looked back on as a very pivotal moment in American history and in politics where that kind of crossroad happened. Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:20:28       because we were, we were pretty satisfied with, uh, that political speech thing that, and we need to bring up the lower middle class and they just go on and on and drone on. It's this weird speech that no real human being ever speaks. Like Hillary was hilarious. And why Wayne? Hey, today is the guy. It was fake. It comes off as fake and phony. Trump comes rolling in. It's absolutely batshit insane. Like the stuff he says, like you were saying the other day, he's, he's giving a speech and he said that when he was younger people said he looked like Elvis because he was doing some kind of a commemorative thing for Elvis, um, uh, down in Tennessee or somewhere. And he says, uh, he looked like Elvis and we're laughing our asses off me and Keith, uh, because no one ever told me Elvis, no one ever told him that.

Speaker 1:          00:21:24       And, and, and there's so many things. And I'm a trump guy. I voted for the guy because I wanted that monkey wrench thrown into the machine. I felt we had gotten screwed too many decades and it was time to let Washington know, like, look, we'd rather elect this nut than any of you guys. So I think it proved a point. Uh, there are enough checks and balances in place where, you know, the likes of any one president really isn't going to do that much damage. I think he's pulled the cover off a lot of stuff. I think people are trying to compete with him on twitter. Politicians are trying to play his game and it's kind of fun to watch as a comic entertainer. It's gold. Do you see what Tulsi Gabbert said to him? What? She's a congresswoman from Hawaii. She said, uh, being Saudi Arabia, bitch isn't making America first.

Speaker 1:          00:22:17       That's a congresswoman. Say they're all kind of taking that. They never used to do that. No, they didn't. And it's odd that a 70 year old guy was the one that was like bringing twitter to social media into this forum. It is on and yeah, you would think it would be some young guy get in there and do it, but I'd never do it the way he's doing it. No, that's just like a reckless maniac. It's, and, and that's because he can. Yeah, the guy you, you'll never see a chain of events like what happened to elect Donald Trump, the rich guy. He's a billionaire and billion, whatever you want to call him. He's got a lot of money from his dad, from his, his dad. And then, you know, I remember him in New York when I was a kid. Trump was always in the news developer.

Speaker 1:          00:23:04       He was always banging heads with politicians, trying to get some kind of zoning thing going or build some other tower somewhere. And uh, so we were all familiar with them and we knew he was like this piece of shit guy. Like everyone was surprised, like, Oh God, he grabbed her by the pussy. He's like, we saw in the daily news and the New York Post every week, trump was with some other hula is. So it wasn't a surprise to us. Uh, but he got out there and it was the perfect timing, like we come off the, uh, the heels of eight years of a Democratic president, uh, and it just was, people were ready for a maniac to be in. The white people were, some people were exactly my favorite image of the election was that lady with the sock hat on her knees with the glasses screaming.

Speaker 1:          00:24:00       That to me ushered in this era of outrage and chaos. Yeah. Yeah. It just said that was like the primal scream that set off the dominoes and they're all in motion right now. It wasn't supposed to happen. It wasn't supposed to happen. Hillary was supposed to be president. That's what everybody thought it was going to go down in history as just one of those wacky elections. And then business as usual. But, uh, you know, when, when trump won, it turned everything upside down and rip the cover off of, I think, not only politics in Washington, but uh, Hollywood, uh, uh, the mainstream media, the news media, everything had the covers ripped off and everyone's now got a peek inside and realize how fucked up everything is. You used to assume Washington, at least the people had some kind of control like they were, they were adults doing the job that needed to be.

Speaker 1:          00:24:56       And then you realize, oh my God, everyone's just a piece of shit. Do you remember? Here's the story that disappeared from years ago. Do you remember the Washington Madam, that suicide or self? Oh yeah, yeah. Book filled with politicians that were, uh, getting there. We're banging all these prostitutes and she was going to release everything and she was doing press conferences and then she committed suicide, committed suicide. But it's like, well, case closed, you know, no big deal that will last her books. Yeah, yeah. Whatever, whatever, whatever. And then it disappeared. It disappeared. Things like that happen. Oh, flag politicians killed people. Oh yeah. There's, there's secret backroom deals that happen and it's crazy. House of cards is way closer to reality than people would like to believe. Yeah. Yeah. Closer. We, uh, over the course of the decades upon decades, uh, every year that goes by, we seem to get a little more knowledge and a little less confident in the government.

Speaker 1:          00:25:50       I mean, I watched some shit from the fifties, you know, there's plenty of things on youtube and even even industrial films, just this thing of how a family, how to raise your family. There had to be a good wife, all that stuff. And it was all this weird propaganda of what America was. And then as years go by, you realize, oh, it was all bullshit. Like politicians were always getting rich and no one seems to know how or why. And these deals that are made aren't always in our best interest. They're not civil servants there to represent and help you. And, and, and as the years go by, we see more and more of this and the past two years with trump has just been a man quite a crash course. It really has. Yeah. It's great. I'm fascinated to see where it goes. I'm fascinated to see if he seems, you know, I mean they always called

Speaker 2:          00:26:44       Godaddy, the Teflon Don, but it seems like trump is the teflon donald. I mean, he seems, it seems like all these things keep happening and, and even because I remember Justin Martin Dale, a comedian friend of mine is hilarious. He goes, uh, he was talking about stormy Daniels. He was like, she's our Monica Lewinsky. She's going to take them down the fuck. That's not happening. No, you don't get it. He doesn't care that they know he fucked her. Yeah. He doesn't care to understand. It's not. You have to care for it to work. Right. And that's just it. People don't really care. It's a, well, some people don't care. I, I follow like Rosie O'donnell's account on twitter and Rob Reiner is another one and for two years, over two years they have just been like counting down and the day that it's like, oh, impeachments right around the corner. Oh, he's out.

Speaker 2:          00:27:41       Oh, they're gonna. Put them in prison. I hope you and your son get a cell next to each other and it's like, how long are you going to do this? Eight years. Is it going to be eight years of you going? Well any day now Keith Miller is going to. Yeah. Do you remember when he was doing that wacky show in a basement somewhere for Gq, like a mental patient, like legitimately like a mental patient resistance screaming and it was like he was doing like. It was almost like burlesque or something. You know what I'm saying? Like you know how it was like the radio version of burlesque is like when you see a girl doing burlesque, it's like a throwback to an old timey way of doing things. Like the guy, the handlebar mustache with a bowler capital introducer. She's body, she is bodacious. Please welcome Matt.

Speaker 2:          00:28:30       I'm blah blah blah. And she comes out to music that nobody listens to anymore and she's dancing around. It's very end. They're there. They're always kind of big girls. They're not skinny little strippers. There are girls who eat, so it's like it's a throwback to a different time of, of rowdiness and when he was in front of that screen, like doing this thing with his suit on and tie like d and everything was like really well written and these precise points and I don't understand like what the red blue and the background was either. It's just, it was. So it seemed like something that someone had set up, like not as good as your compound of the. Yeah. You live from the compound. It wasn't, it wasn't as good as that. It's like that's the background. This is for Gq. Gq was like, okay, we have $30 dollars I think.

Speaker 2:          00:29:21       Uh, I think uh, Charlie's got a camera. He could bring it in $30. Good. Okay. We have a table, the Ikea table. That's $12. You have $18 left. We got some construction paper for the background. What the fuck is this? I got some big ass blue and blue and red paint. Yeah. Posters. Like what, what is that? And then he would just pontificate there and he and his last thing was like, because the end is eminent, there's no, no reason for me to go on. Right. If it's finished. Yeah. What is this? My work here is done play some of this. Trump is finished in one year. One year ago. This week. Exactly. One year ago. Last November 11, 2017. It was when he quit.

Speaker 4:          00:30:06       Get a pardon from trump, wore the bowler as I've also reported here, has succeeded in finding a way around trumps. Pardon? Power in either of these near certainties spelled trump's do. So that's the most obvious of the seven ways for trump to go. Now smaller. Really, we'll get him on Russia. It will be ugly. It will tear this country nearly apart, but it will be necessary. The second way is as I've also repeatedly suggested here, that Mahler doesn't really need to prove anything about trump and Russian sabotage of the election. There seems to be so much obstruction of justice for the firing of James Comey to the lies about trump jr's meetings with the Russians, that it's hard to pick out a key player in the trump inner circle who could not be guilty of it.

Speaker 2:          00:30:56       It's so funny. A year ago and it's like, it's still going. Still going. Still going and it gets fake news. Yeah. And it now fake news. It's a hoax, but it is interesting. Like molar to me, it's fascinating because he seems like a ruthless motherfucker takes his time. He's like a guy says, hey, look at me. I'm going to kill you. It's not going to be today. Okay. That's all you need to know. Yes I can be today, but I'm going to fucking kill you. And like every day he's plotting on killing you. You see them drive by your house in ways like when is, when is the hammer fall? And you look out your window of your office. He's out here. Look at that guy drinking coffee. Oh, he has seen some shit. Oh, this guy, he's. Yeah. I mean he's a cold blooded intelligence agent.

Speaker 2:          00:31:42       Yeah. Yeah, those guys have seen everything. He knows the inner workings, the machine, and he knows how you bring a guy like that down and how you fuck it up and he's doing everything. That leads me to believe that he's not fucking it up. This is a slow play and if there is, if there is anything to the Russian thing, you would think something would have leaked out by now. Well, it has. I mean it was, there was a video the other day of Donald that they just played on cnn of Donald was talking about how many times he's actually been to rush donald junior and you know, he had said that he hadn't been. But then there's another video of him from years ago saying, yeah, I've been there many times. Five, six, seven, eight, talking about business. The problem with, uh, the people that are going after trump, they don't seem to understand the guy right up until he became president of the United States was just a private citizen businessman. So he had a lot of dealings around

Speaker 1:          00:32:40       the world with his real estate and buildings and golf courses. All this shit happened when he was just a citizen doing business now, whether it was ethical or not, um, that, that could definitely be brought into question, whether it's legal or not a, I'm sure that's what they're looking into also, but he wasn't, he wasn't beholden to the people as a public servant. There wasn't a conflict of interest because he was a lifelong politician and using the power of his office to make deals so, and that also goes hand in hand with him just fucking around. Like, like if he went from a selectman in his hometown and then years and years go by and then you're the president and you built that career up. Any at any point in there they could call you out on being a horrible human being because you fucked girls or you're this.

Speaker 1:          00:33:33       So you'd had a shady business dealings. But up until two years ago, he was just donald fucking trump. Yeah. So it's hard to call them out on even dealing with Russia because there's plenty of business and deal with Russia and China. I think the question is whether or not he colluded with Russia to get information about Hillary and also to to to put out all that propaganda against Hillary and also saying that they're going to make a deal to do the trump tower in Moscow. This is all while he was running for president. Not being honest about it. I think that's, that's where it gets again. I don't know almost there's anything illegal there. I don't know if there's anything that, that he did that is illegal because I believe when you're campaigning say whatever the fuck you want to anybody really running. I mean you're really running anything.

Speaker 1:          00:34:23       It really running the country. Yeah. If he lost the presidency, he would still have to have some ducks in a row to continue his business. So you know, and his son took over that part of, of what he was doing so he could campaign. So whether Donny Jr went over to Russia or not, I don't really see. You might think it's unethical and you might go, well, did he say if we win, we'll do this and help you out. So who knows about that part of it, but I don't see in and of itself him going over there being that big a problem and the fact that, you know, the Clinton campaign and the DNC, they had a lot of shady deals going on with Russia also in that crazy dossier and an English spy and a Russian like. And that just never seems to get any traction. It's weird. Well, there's way more left wing media publications in the right way. Absolutely. Just the fact there's only a few right wing, uh, newspapers and right wing websites are oftentimes maligned, treated seriously. Like there's no right wing newspaper that's treated with the same amount of respect is the New York Times columnist. It doesn't exist. Now. What the, uh, the New York Post, the New York Post right wing. Outrageous. Yeah. They don't give

Speaker 2:          00:35:38       a fuck who you are. Liberal Democrat, Sro, conservative Republican. They'll fuck you. Some of the headlines that have come off of the fucking post have been classic over the years. They're amazing. Yeah. Like comics. Yeah. Yeah. It's just comedy. One was one I thought was just so douchey when Fred astaire died, it was said a stairway to heaven like fucking, but that someone must have gotten a hit for this. The one thing that I do love about New York and Boston to yeah, is a harshness to the comedy because people are fucking cold. It's cold in the wintertime is calling like fuck you and that growing up there, man, it fucking flavored me flavored bourbon. There's a million guys like that that like that. Patrice, that fucking comedy. A lot of it came out of that part of the world because that part of the world is different. Isn't that weird?

Speaker 2:          00:36:31       It's, it's cold and you think that just makes people angry. A cold and a lot of people I think and very few people makes people like more down home. Me and compassionate and they stay together. Tana, except for a few serial killers randomly scattered, scattered out into the woods, but other than that you get like people that work together and help each other because they realized they were in this together. Yeah, there is A. There's a stark difference between New York and Boston based comics and La based company. It's amazing difference. Yeah. Yeah. And some of them have that crossover appeal there and they've moved, you know, and uh, like bill, but maintains that Boston sensibility, that New York sensibility. Yeah. Yeah. What's appealing about him is that he's still a savage, right, exactly. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Like that. You don't grow that out here. It's sunny, it's nice every day.

Speaker 2:          00:37:26       Everyone's a. everyone's seems kind of pleasant out here, whether it's real or phoniness, but it comes off as pleasantry and in New York is just a grave disregard for everybody. Uh, you literally step over people. Many people lose their value. Yeah. Like if you have a million pennies and you drop a penny, put up. Shit. Lost the guy on the train. Now it is odd when you think about if there was somebody just laying in the gutter of the street in some small town in Kansas, uh, the police and ambulance would be called and people would stop and ask if he was okay. And, and in New York you literally step over those people. You just don't even look in their face. It's a. it's an inconvenience that someone is laying on the sidewalk. If you were in the middle of a snowstorm and you were, your car broke down and you saw a guy laying on the side of the road. Yeah, you'd help him. Of course. He'd be like, oh, Jesus, poor guy. Look, we've got to help him to. Hey Buddy. You're alright. Yeah. Yeah. Not so

Speaker 1:          00:38:36       much New York, New York. You just see him lying in his own piss needle hanging out of his dick. And I'm pissed that it stinks down in the subway. Fucking gross. Like fucking disgusting, man. Yeah. No compassion stink too though. In a steamy August day. It's the worst and it's gotten worse. Uh, under uh, Deblazio who's a mayor of New York now and say what you want about Giuliani, who now is batshit crazy? What happened with him? I don't know. I blew a fuse. He's not respectable anymore. He's like some kind of. Well, he aligned himself with trump, so that immediately gets you put into a category. But he's also a little. I think he's got some dementia going on, like he just doesn't seem right. It is lost his comb over that he had a comb over for, what is that? Like a, what's his name with the comb over and he realized, Oh my God, I'm fucking crazy.

Speaker 1:          00:39:30       Samson's hair. It's like that. He, he lost the last wisps, those last wisps of comb-over yeah. That he'd had during nine slash 11 going on. Yeah, he was at one point, you know, after nine slash 11, they call it nine, 10, 2011. He was a piece of shit. No one liked Giuliani. He ruined New York. He ruined it by commercializing it, cleaning up all the porn theaters. Uh, getting rid of the tunnel bunnies and the squeegee guys like he went on a tear, just gave the police department carte blanche to start racking head and taking care of business. A cleaned up New York Times Square turned into a Disney type atmosphere instead of that drug addled fucking mess that it was. And, and people hated them for kind of ruining that Gritty New York that we saw in taxi driver and shit. And then nine slash 11, he was America's mayor.

Speaker 1:          00:40:23       That's what they called them, America's mayor. He's going to Yankee Games and ovations and people. He's standing with the other. He looked so crazy. Person on the right. Yeah. Yeah. He is totally shaved his head to talk to them. I say, listen Bro, there's a lot of power in just shaving your that head motherfucker. Yeah. You feel good. You feel like a guy who has like hair on the side of his head, unless you do a lot of drugs like hunter, s Thompson. It's hard. You can't pull that off, I think. Yeah. Uh, for right hand side. That's a, that's a comb over in the beginning. Yeah. Above that. Above that. Above that to right to the right of the suit. Look at that. Oh yeah. That's where it's first started. That's the full. Oh my God, look at that. Oh, the back. Like what did he do? Did he try to get plugs or something in the front? I don't think so. I don't know what that is. It's just rocking the full strong comb-over that is. Uh, he, uh, he had a lot to do with the, the, the, um, getting rid of organized crime in New York City, like the mafia, the five families, all that shit was still running pretty rampant throughout the seventies and eighties as

Speaker 2:          00:41:34       a kid. Me and my brother used to laugh our asses off. We'd open the newspaper and it was like Johnny the Horse, he was found dead. And so we laugh our asses off at the names, like just those, those mob names. It's hilarious. And that scene in Goodfellas at the beginning when they're just going through and, you know, the nose and killer and this guy and they all have those fucking names that are hilarious. And uh, yeah, Juliana was a big part of that. I'm surprised they didn't kill him. Like he was absolutely irresponsible. He kept going after them and kept putting them away with the, you know, the new Rico statutes that they had and a locked up. A lot of mobsters, man. So, well, you know, another problem with the mom says they started rapping. I mean, yeah, yeah, yeah. As soon as you start ratting on each other all year, mystique is gone.

Speaker 2:          00:42:22       Your whole, your whole legend is gone. This the whole thing is that you guys have Omerta. You keep your fucking mouth shut. You do your time like a man when you get out and you're a hero and this whole thing keeps going. This thing of ours, this thing was, but those fucking pussies didn't want to go to jail. Isn't that something like the old school guys would be offered, you know, you can walk or you could get a really easy sentence. Just talk a fuck your mother and, and, and then yeah, if they reached the point where it's like, yeah, I, I'm not built for prison. When they would put them in prison though, it was like in Goodfellas it would be able to cook and they paid the guards off a sweet setup. The internet ruined all that too. Yeah. Yeah. You went, well it was probably all dead before the Internet, but, but you know, like Sammy the bull Gravano, he was free.

Speaker 2:          00:43:12       He did his time to the minimum amount of time he killed at least 10 people that, I mean, he, he confessed to them, you know, talked about the morality did and how he did them. He wanted it so bad. They wanted it so bad. Let me, Sammy the bull gravano was a fucking straight up psychopath. Yeah. That's total serial killer. And they let him walk and then he got arrested eventually for selling ecstasy in Phoenix. He moved to Phoenix after that. Yeah. Yeah. And then he was running shit down there. And how did he just not get whacked out? Like was the mob was gone. They all were gone. No one cared. Hated it all. It all crumbled at that something. Yeah, just like A. Yeah, poof. Went away. The thing that like, he was the first one that was like real flashy and public about that.

Speaker 2:          00:44:02       They didn't like that. Vincent the Chin always used to walk around like a crazy person in the bathroom. Bathroom. It was nuts. But he would, he would give people directions while he was doing that, but he felt like everything was being bugged so that they would do, is they have bugged cars along his walking route. They can record him. Oh, that is hilarious. What he was doing. Jesus. There's always a way. There's always a way to get you. Yeah. The mystique was gone though. Yeah. It wasn't really like the Russians still have the mystique Russian mobsters.

Speaker 1:          00:44:32       They are brutal, scary ones. Like they are the scary ones. There's a worse ma because regardless of what it turned into, there was a time where the Italian mob did have a line. Like you didn't cross family, things like that. Uh, but the Russians, all my God, will they fuck up an entire family? The dog. Everything gets killed in the worst way. Yeah. They're scary. Scary motherfuckers. I had a, an experience. I'm out. It was a broadway I guess. Uh, and they have those peddle cabs that go around and they were all Russian dudes, big legs on them. And they peddle around and I was looking for a cab or real cab to take me downtown. I wasn't gonna ride 15 blocks in a tricycle with Uri peddling in front of me. So, uh, this guy passed by once and said, you need the cab.

Speaker 1:          00:45:24       I was like, no, I'm good, thanks. Comes around again. I'm still waiting for a cab and he goes, cab. And I was like, I'm not going to have you pedaled me 15 fucking blocks. No move. And, and you could yell at a cab driver in New York. They'll yell out your window and stuff. They've rarely will get out of their car. They know, you know, you've got the medallion right there. You could just call the number and say you were being harassed by a cab driver so they won't do anything. This guy gets off his fucking bike, you have a fucking problem. Fucking problem was. And I was just like, oh shit, it's going down. This guy means business. And of course I'm like, no, no. All good. All good. I thank you. I don't need a a cab. You'll write the motherfuck and that was it.

Speaker 1:          00:46:11       But you don't fuck with Russia. No, they're not regular white people. No, they're not. They're not. They're hard people. Yeah. Yeah. You see that in the UFC is a lot of bad ass rush. Well, obviously we should know. We saw that a recent. Yeah. When was on top of connor punched him in the face saying let's talk. No talk. Boom, let's talk. Come up. We'd talk. Boom. Just twisted. Terrific. Yeah. Yeah. And then they got those other videos that you see on youtube and whatnot of Russians just up in a steel. Ibm's yeah, like a hundred stories up backflips swinging back backflips hanging bike. Two fingers in that and sometimes falling. Yeah. My hands are sweating. You just talking about that makes my hands feel like it is so uncomfortable to watch. And uh, because they're, they get themselves in these positions where maybe there's this thin little alcove and, and they put their hands against one side their feet against the other. If your feet slip, there's no. No. Recovering drives me crazy is not. Look, I got goosebumps. Is it a weird to get a visceral reaction to just the thought. And I have some friends that just know that I freak out. So they sent me those. Every Christ. Yeah. There are some things

Speaker 2:          00:47:30       that, uh, are online. Scott, what the fuck? Oh my God. Oh. Oh, they are nuts. I can't do this man. My hands are pouring ca. Yeah. Oh my God. Look at this crazy ass hole. Oh my God. Crazy shit. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. What does it say? Dare Devil returns with latest shocking stunt on skyscraper. This fucking mother fucker. But he's doing a handstand on. What is that? A three inch ledge. Oh God. Come on. Come around the corner. What are you doing this? You fuck a one little. One. Little fucking miscalculation. Or how do you do that? How do you know your center of gravity? Is it just gonna? Pull your right. The fuck up. Jesus Christ. He went around the corner. That's nuts. What is this guy's lifelike? If he decides he's going to do this? This makes me very uncomfortable. That is so fucking high up.

Speaker 2:          00:48:46       It's so high. That is so high. I wouldn't, I can't do what he did if he was on the ground, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I can't. I can't do those handstands and all that jazz brown mark out three inches and try to stay on it with your hand or mark it up enough so that you like put pads under me. Right, right. And then give it so I could jump up and grab it and hang out. See how much of that I could do, like a couple of things. I could king from my fingers. I might be able to pull myself up, but if I got to the top I probably slip. Yeah. Yeah. Your height will definitely fuck with you. Like if you're riding a bike on a sidewalk, you will never fall off the sidewalk. You could just ride your bike. You don't even have to think about it.

Speaker 2:          00:49:26       Sidewalk what? Couple of feet wide. If that was over like the Grand Canyon, you, you would be shaking. You couldn't do it. And it's the same fucking thing. It's just your perception and the height and you know, you'd be, you'd be fucked up. You'd be like, there's going to fall off. We have that htc vibe in the back room here. Oh yeah. Yeah. And uh, there's one game we have to download that game. We haven't gotten that game when you go to the hardware store and you buy a two by four and you lay it down on the floor and then the game is, you put the vr goggles on and you're walking on this two by four over, like in between two skyscrapers. Right? So as you're doing it in here, so this is, this is the actual game. Oh my God. You step out. Oh, here's the two by four. So this two by four is real. Like you have an actual two by fours really walking on this. So you're feeling it and you walk the plank. Oh my God. Oh my God. And you look down, you're like, what is that thing floating in front of? You don't know.

Speaker 1:          00:50:28       What's that supposed to be, Jamie? I've never done it. I don't know. It's uh, yeah, the uh, first of all watching it on a screen does vr no justice. You can't really, you are in a space. It's so cold to kind of look around. They, they definitely have more work to do. Yeah, it's a, it looks cool. You feel like you're in a three d environment, but it's not very photo realistic. No. Uh, for kids are addicted to it. Really run here afterschool. Oh really? Put the vr goggles. They fight over it and they put the vr goggles on and play these fucking crazy games. Yeah. Uh, I have, uh, the Oculus and the vive and the playstation vr at home and right now the Oculus is the highest quality of the vr goggles. Um, I think playstation has some pretty cool games out there though. [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          00:51:20       does too, but I think uh, a Oculus is going to come out very soon with a completely wireless one. So it was a htc vive. Yeah. Yeah. So you're not tethered to anything and you're tripping over wires and shit. That's going to be big. Yeah. That, that's pretty huge. It's weird though because uh, some games aren't conducive to vr and you would think like I play call of duty or battlefield five World War II thing just came out and I love that, that game. But I couldn't play that for our [inaudible]. I will play for fucking hours on end and to have the goggles on that long and uh, trying to play a shooter like that. Um, I think vr right now is more conducive to experiences than it is like that. That's pretty much not a game. It's an experience and it brings you into a whole nother three d world around you.

Speaker 1:          00:52:09       But uh, like a shooter game, like battlefield or call of duty not really conducive to vr right now. Not yet. Yeah. I think in the future though, a plastic gun. Yes. Like a real. If you were holding a real plastic, you'd need that interface. Yeah. That would be fucking amazing for a shooter game. Yeah. Yeah. There's a few other ideas that they're working on that should be available pretty relatively soon where the system maps your house, like the room you're, you're in off of your headset and will superimpose things over the couch. Like it'll be a ammo crate. A chair turns into a box ammo crate. So as you walk around the room, uh, it's reading your room, but making this vr world that looks more military or like a jungle or whatever it is, so it won't be a couch, you'll hit it, but in your vision it'll be a box or an ammo crate or you know, what a car, something like that. So, uh, that's kind of cool. Uh, utilizing, uh, the real environment around you and then superimposing shit over it. You know, what else is really cool? The boxing games. Yeah. And the boxing games, you get a crazy workout, you get a real legit workout because you're actually fake boxing this cartoon character. And when you get

Speaker 3:          00:53:26       hit you see a bright white flash like,

Speaker 1:          00:53:29       like you got. Yeah, like you got hit like you got your Bell Rung You, but you get, you get a real workout when you're doing this. So yeah, breath. I've watched, uh, my, my girl plays that and it's hilarious. It's funny to watch people do Vr, especially stuff like that because they're ducking. There's another shooter game that she was playing and it's hilarious because she's screaming and ducking down and your hand is up like pulling a trigger on a fake gun over something that isn't even there. So it's, it's cool to watch people play. It was some crazy Zombie game that my kids play. It's like you get a bunch of guns and ammo and then the zombies are closing in on. You got a gun. I'm down. Yeah. Yeah. This is weird. I'll tell you, there are some games or experiences where you're walking through a kind of a haunted house thing that are genuinely fucking alarming.

Speaker 1:          00:54:18       Yeah. Like, like you don't want to, you don't want to go around a corner, you don't want to do anything and you know, like when you watch on the Monitor, it's just the Monitor. There's shit behind you that you're not seeing unless you turn around and look. So you hear a sound and be like, I am not to. I don't want to turn around. I know that thing's going to be right in my face and it's frightening. What is the alien game for? Is that for the vibe or. Oculus is a Ridley Scott Alien. Yeah, that's the. I think it's both because I had it for Oculus. It's fucking terrifying. Alien something. Yeah. It's the one like alien. The original movie. Yeah. Yeah. You're on a ship. It's a, it starts with the doors open up and that little thing, drinking of the water. That little chotchkies on the, uh, on the task and it's A. Yeah, it really gives a good to a recreation of the, of the movie, which was fucking awesome. That's one of the greatest one goes down as one of my

Speaker 3:          00:55:14       favorite scene is also one of my favorite examples when people talk about pushing diversity and movies. Oh yeah. This movie had a female lead who is a female superstar who a spoiler alert winds up winning in the end, but you don't need even notice now. It never feels like it's crammed down your throat. Right. As the last star wars, it was like, get the fuck out of here, Laura dern. You're not running the empire here. You're like, what is this? Like? She's the head General and then Carrie Fisher's the other head general, and I'm telling these men to shut up and this all makes sense to you. Is in that fucking amazing.

Speaker 1:          00:55:53       They had a, that was 1979 and they had more of an idea of how to present that then. Uh, yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:56:01       First of all, sigourney weaver's just a fucking bad ass believable movies. Believe that she pulled it together. She was such a great actress. So that's alien if this ascent, like,

Speaker 1:          00:56:12       that thing that you did at Disney though. Oh, go to free roaming vr came out earlier this year in orange, California and exactly that would jamie and I talked about that many times. Like

Speaker 2:          00:56:24       that's the future, like a warehouse, like this space out here, but converted into a giant vr experience. Yeah. Yeah. Whereas Orange California on from here, look at that and we need to go to him. When I first saw alien, I'm back. Uh, you know, kids. I saw it in the movie theater when it first came out there, kids sat. My mom took me. It was 79. Yeah. Yeah. And it was a leap. It was just one of those movies that at the time everyone goes, oh my God, you got to see this, that the chest fucking burst scene just slayed people. Uh, but yeah, w w when you watch them that, because traditional movies, the guys the hero and that's what happens when Tom Skerritt gets it. You're just like, wait, why are they just killed the star, the hero that was, it was Tom Skerritt. Yeah. As like not his bucket moves a big movie star.

Speaker 2:          00:57:15       Yeah. Yeah. And then I think it was like the first movie where the spaceship was kind of a truck and it was just dirty and just regular guys concerned about getting paid and, and shit like that. So, uh, yeah, that's why it was amazing. Which is this one? This is a covenant in Utero that came up a year or two ago. Cool. Oh, so this is after the covenant movie, which is a fucking awesome one. That's recent one. I love movies I love. They're so good. I like that shit. That movie. They nailed it. It was just great. It didn't matter if a woman was running and it was, they weren't shoving it down your throat. No. Whereas I felt like that last star wars one with Laura Dern and Carrie Fisher was like flying, flying. Carrie Fisher. Come on. Yeah, I stopped. I wasn't feeling it. I didn't feel like they were. Look, there's certain women like, um, what is her name from house of cards? The, the, the head woman Watson. Jenny from Jenny from Sean Penn.

Speaker 2:          00:58:25       Penn. So it's something, something, something Penn fuck's her name. I think she used that to. I'm embarraSsed, right robin? Round robin, right? Robin wright. Okay. Robin wright was playing a general. I believe it. Yeah, bitch. Right. She could, she could send in some fucking tanks, I believe. I believe that she would like the planet. I'd buy that. Right. But uh, carrie fisher and laura dern, I was like, come on, I see what you're doing. They're running things. I, I think they've, uh, they just, they're putting out too many star wars movies to have that mystique and that kind of a atmosphere that it was like to go to one of them years ago. It's also, it's, it's disney now. Yeah. Yeah. Which is great because it's consistent and it's good. Right. But it's never stunning. It's terrifying. It's never. It's never x mokena. Right, right. Yeah. Yeah. it's never fucked up.

Speaker 2:          00:59:22       Like when you leave the theater going, holy shit. Yeah, yeah. Can't do that anymore. They kind of polish off the sharp edges and sued the experience down to a palatable mainstream appeal that first, the first star wars back in [inaudible] 77 again. I saw that in a movie theater with my uncle. My uncle joe took me and I didn't know stores from a home of wall. I remember the trailer playing on tv and I was like, all right, that seems kind of cool. Uh, and then we sit down and that opening scene with the giant ship just does a fly over. And I was just, from that point on, I was just mesmerized with this. The illusion of size that they got in the ship and it was an old school ship. The added out of like plastic model of practical effects. It was all like models, like they went and bought like a bunch of different.

Speaker 2:          01:00:14       You remember those old bottles that we used to do like cars and oem. Remember those glue them together. You get the bottle glue, rIght? I used to love those. Yeah. They took a bunch of parts from those things and built the millennium falcon. They built those battleships from like parts and you can kind of tell because they're so weird and eclectic and some of the parts don't seem to match. Worked. It totally worked. Yeah. That was a. You know, if you. You didn't imagine being in a, in one of those x wing fighters as a kid, it was just an amazing thing that's kinda gone. It shows you how great alien like ridley scott alien really was because all those star wars was a great movie. Honestly, star wars doesn't really hold up [inaudible] like if you watch it today, you look at the special effects, like what?

Speaker 2:          01:01:04       What am I watching this clunky and, and then the catena scenes and I that. Yeah. Yeah. That's always. The mouths don't move like the monster phases. Like, it's weird if they're wearing a mask, it's really obvious, but then you go just two yeaRs later to ridley scott alien, that motherfucker holds up today. It looks amazing. You know, I got yelled at because I've watched it with my kids because my 10 year old can handle shit. My eight year old cannot. Oh man, I, I watched it. I'm like, you think you can handle it? And they'Re like, yeah, I can handle it. okay. I'm going to die the first time. The dude got the tongue to the forehead. What? Watching daddy night maRes bill. Remember that? Yeah, my dad, my mom and my dad took me, my brother and my sister when I was seven years old to go see bonnie and clyde with a warren beatty. And uh, what's her name there? I can't remember who played by faye dunaway. Very good. Thank you. Yes. And uh, now it's famous for being one of the most graphic

Speaker 1:          01:02:20       machine gunning at the end of the movie. I mean they were pulling up. They got ambushed by law and uh, they just get shot up the whole movie though as a seven year old kid. I liked these people. They were funny. They've robbed banks and stuff, but you know, they, they'd make jokes and they were coal and you've got to know him as a person. So as a seven year old I was like, oh, these, these people are cool. So then the end of the movie comes and, and they're out there and you hear the birds fly away and clyde looks at bonnie, uh, with, uh, one lens missing from his, his glasses and it's really quiet and then all hell breaks loose. It's just five guys shooting thompson's at both of them and they're being riddled with bullet holes and the scene goes on and they're falling down and against the car.

Speaker 1:          01:03:10       The car is just full. Yeah, there it is. It's, it's so brutal. It's crazy to seeing the girl get it. Oh yeah. Something ruthless about seeing a girl gets shot a hundred times. Yeah. Yeah. Look at her. It was, I, I'm that. We saw this at the drive in and uh, I, I started vomiting in the car seven years old. We had, we had been to arby's before, so, uh, my rbs was all over the car. I was screaming, crying and throwing up, going like, what the fuck did you take me to say I liked these people. I had like a to our relationship with them and it ends like that. I was horrified. Horrified. As a kid.

Speaker 3:          01:03:57       Yeah. There's certain things, but is that bad? Like ultimately you saw that when you weRe a kid, like maybe, maybe it's maybe it's not good to shield kids from too much.

Speaker 1:          01:04:08       Maybe not to that extent. Show me a cartoon first or something because I dunno, I dunno if it affected me. It's hard to tell Without knowing what it would be like if I didn't see stuff like that. Uh, but the fact that I remember it vividly so many years later

Speaker 3:          01:04:24       maybe had an effect, but yeah, but it isn't a negative effect. There's certain experiences that you want, you can have, like today as an adult, you could see a movie where a guy gets shot and you can handle. It dOesn't freak you out. Of course, if you saw it when you were four, you'd probably freak out. Yeah. But is it good to expeRience that when you're four just so that you know, it's a thing and you have a different view of the world or is it good like you're not a parent, but as a parent, this is the age old question. Like hoW much do you protect your kids and how much do you let them break their arm? Because you break your arm, you know, if you fall, you break your arm. If everybody's like helicopter parenting, you constantly like, I don't want anybody to die, but I don't mind if anybody gets banged up a little bit.

Speaker 3:          01:05:05       Right. Thank you. Should I think you should know that if you trip it hurts. You know there's. And there's also, you should know that bullets are real. This is a real thing that happens. like with my kids, ever since my kids have been really little, I've been hunting and so I've been bringing home meat and explaining to them that this is meat from an animal that I shot. If you go to the supermarket and you buy a steak that came from an animal and I try to get this in their head at a early age, so then I introduced them to watching a hunting show with me where we shot a deer and then took the deer apart. Polshek shake you seeing like they're watching us cut an elca part. My kids watching this and I'm like, well this is where you get meat. Like when we eat dinner, if we eat elk for dinner, this is exactly where it came from. I shot it in the mountains. We cut it up. We packed it out on our back. We put it into a truck. We drove somewhere and now we're here. Now we're eating it. This is a. Yeah. I guess if you present it like that, that's I would guess is a good thing maybe. But there's something weird about watching a little kid watching animal gets shot where like, uh, yeah, they realized my dad and that is that good? Is my debt a piece of shit?

Speaker 3:          01:06:21       These animals are so beautiful. Well, animals aRe hot dog. Your hot dogs a fucking that you want a hot dog, right? Yeah. Yeah. And that'S an animal like, okay. Like, because most kids just, it's a hot dog. It's the. Yeah. It's not an actual animal. They kind of know, like if you asked a little kid, hey, we're this cheeseburger came from, oh it's from a cow. But that's like, damn. That's like saying the moon is a one, six earth's gravity. I know that. I don't know what the fuck that means. Yeah, yeah, yeah. No real. I don't have a real chance apply it to anything. so yeah. So when do you show your kids? Like, like there's a lot of videos that I watch while close my laptop and the kids come in, they're like violent videos. So yeah, especially like animals. Like I was watching this video of these hyenas tearing apart this gazelle.

Speaker 3:          01:07:09       Oh, fucking horrific. the ripping the guts out. Oh, yanking on the guts and this thing is making these weird noises like home and chunks of its guts out. Oh my god, fuck, fuck. And then my, you know, my lIttle girl comes over and slammed it and she's like, what are you watching? And I'm watching the hyena rip apart gazelles guts. She's like, oh, okay. I don't want to say all right. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So, but, but kind of what's the difference between that and showing you hunting? like is there a. I'm doing a quick. That's one difference. When I shoot an animal, if I shoot an animal with a bow, it's dead in seconds. Yeah. You know, with a well placed shot, it's not going anywhere. It's like the last elk I shot, that one that's right out there on the floor in front of the werewolf. That thing died in five yards, five yards, tipped over, feet up in the air, got shot. Her rIght in the heart was perfect shot. So it was, it was almost instantaneous death. Yes, it might've lived 15, 20 seconds and that was it. People. Uh, I don't. People don't seem

Speaker 1:          01:08:16       to be shocked that much anymore. I know you're trying to keep it from your kids and things like that obviously makes sense, but it's almost impossible to keep some really horrific shit from people, especially if you give your kid a phone. Yeah, yeah. You're giving them access to a lot of nasty stuff. And like I remember when I was a kid, the, the big thing was like faces of death. You want to go get faces a death man, we'll watch it. It's crazy guys. They beat up a monkey and cut his head off and eat the brains and everything. I'm like, yeah, that's kind of fake. And you could tell the stage things and I think the only real stuff was a like news footage of airline disasters and accidents. And so that was one that was real where these, uh, these guys, uh, somewhere in the middle east tied these guys arms to one car and his legs to it and they pulled them apart.

Speaker 1:          01:09:09       I cannot watch that shit. It's terrible. And now in stunning hd, you can see in a snuff films years ago was kind of an urban myth, you know, it was a thing, now they're readily available to anybody in a matter of seconds and I don't know what kind of effect that has on people and, and maybe society. But uh, and there's really nothIng you could do pandora's out. So I think it's affecting people though. Oh, it's definitely sensitizing. That's the argument about video games as well, right? yeah. We're seeing so much violence in committing violence in video games. Like, uh, jamie, what was that video game where, uh, the guy got in trouble because he made a video of him torturing some as in redmond he punched, he punched a. I'm a woman in the face that was a pRotesting for, um, women's rights, women's rights to vote suffrage.

Speaker 1:          01:10:07       And uh, and he got in trouBle because he posted it and it, yeah, it was like a violent thing against women. But it's a thing you can do in the game, right? Like they made it in the game. So you Could do that on purpose. And once it became viral, people started going up to her in the game and doing even more terrible than there's one where a guy ropes her hog ties or throws her on the back oF the horse, rides her to a swamp and throws her to an aLligator which then eats her and the swamp. That is so crazy that you can do that. If the allegation unbelievable the alligator will eat. And it's not even a thing like, hey, do this. It's just part of the game that they said, well, if people want to do it, It's a very open ended game.

Speaker 1:          01:10:47       Rockstar went bullshit with this game. It's amazing. Does, does it always happen the exact same way or do you throw rocks in the water and the alligator has a different way of. Yeah, there are different animations for the same thing. So, and different. Actually there was one, uh, you'll be riding next to a guy that you're supposed to ride somewhere with. And I'm, the guy says something like, all right, we're almost there or something. And, and if you're far away from the guy, he yells it, alright, we're almost there. And if he's right next to you, he goes, well, we're almost there like the guy, the voice actor, how to do a shitload of takes based on what the animation is. So I did the voiceover for the ufc game, right. Took for ever forever. You're there for days and days and days, readIng every single variation of a head kick to an arm bar to a take down to ground and pound to tko stoppage to kicking someone in the nuts like everything.

Speaker 1:          01:11:49       and someone's got to fucking put that together. And then it's got to be coded where it plays at the right time. It really is amazing. Yeah, it's god damn amazing. I, um, but red, red dead's like really insane. Is this it? There's a, what is this? This is the. Yeah, this is a guy. Oh, this guy just smoking a cigar. So it's so funny. The things that go on in this game, the ability to kill people. I had a Louis J. Gomez on the show and he, he plays this and uh, he, there's like a morality direction you could take. You could either be a good guy or bad guy, really good, really bad, and it will affect how the course of the game and and whether you're wanted, whether people are nice to you. Real. Yeah. Yeah. Like you could do a favor for somebody. You'd be riding somewhere and someone will go, please, could you help me ouT?

Speaker 1:          01:12:45       Just a women's rights activist. Not hurt, but he's going to throw this lady off of the mountain and this is just some guy online has done this. This is the same youtube he does. He's got a lot of videos. Oh jeez. He fell. He fell. He fell himself. He was trying to kick her off and oh ha ha. But a and louis apparently would kill everybody. He killed a guy's dog and skinned it in front of him and then shot him in the face. Like, that's really neat. That's really neat. Dog in front of the guy and the guy's just like crying. It's brutal. I mean, do you thInk that most politicians, are those people looking for outrageous? Just not aware of this yet? yeah, absolutely. Not. Years ago they were kind of like, well, this must be violent video games, and it was so funny because like 10 years after doom, like they're showing doom on tv.

Speaker 1:          01:13:37       Like, oh, that's the bad video game. I was like, jesus christ, that's nothing. What are you talking about? And now like, uh, like I said at datto, same guys. Yeah. Yeah. joe gta. I did some of the voices in gta five. It was fucking hilarious. So I know. Yeah, to do that. I sang some of the uh, promotional songs for the beer piss watser beer. It was great. I know laszlo, who does all the sound for the, uh, the games. But uh, this thing sold like $750, million dollars in the first three days that came out. What happens if you bring a black man to the kkk? They have fucking kkk, rally planned, rally going on and there's a part of the game where you have to infiltrate what happens when you bring a black guy at different happened really the clan, they don't freak out.

Speaker 1:          01:14:21       Not, not in particular, but the job. I think the mission here is to just kill all the klan guys. It's not like you join up and I'll have a good time. It would be more realistic is if you brought a black guy to the clan, mean they tried to kill the black guy. Right? Right. But that would be real. That would be crazy. There are some weird parts in it where they're very misogynistic because it's supposed to be like 1899 or something and it's very misogynistic. And then there's some race references that they make that are kind of like, oof, oof. wow. That's bold. Like what, what do they say about black guy? Like they'll call them boy in some of the, uh, when, when a guy like a non player character will pass by and be kind of nasty and uh, they never presented in a good way.

Speaker 1:          01:15:08       It's not like, you know, oh, cool, this guy's great. Uh, it's always some scumbag. A character. Yeah. I love him. It's like the last frontier for chaos right now. Yeah, it really is. And I think because there's such a lack of awareness on the part of a lot of people, like I, I get games the day they come and actually before I get alpha testing, beta testing, I'm playing the games months before they come out. Really? Yeah. I love it. I get it on that. Uh, you sign up for a, uh, the ultimate package on origin or steam and you get access to the games when they, when they're testing them. Mostly just pay. Yeah. Yeah. It's a pay thing. Obviously they want to make some, some money and I want to play. The games are really busting your report bugs and things on. Yeah. Yeah. If you just play, they automatically kind of have something in place that will let them know if there's a problem or you can email them and say, hey there, you know, I died and I'm stuck in a rock now up to my waist.

Speaker 1:          01:16:07       Have you ever talked to some of the people that make those things? Do you ever have them on your show? Laszlo works at rockstar. He's a sound engineer guy. He records all the sound, but he's involved in every aspect of all those games from the beginning of grand theft auto, the first red dead redemption two. Um, and uh, it's amazing. I've been to rockstar in New York and took a tour of the place and it's just a bunch of fucking nerds sitting around. They have a day where, you know, you can bring your dogs in and it's all wide open. No cubicles or anything. The guys that run it are these english guys and they're brilliant or New Zealand or something. They have that accent sense. One of those weird accents that you can't tell where it's from work insane hours. Yeah, that's it. They are dedicated like a game, like, like a rockstar game, gta or that.

Speaker 1:          01:16:59       It's so above other games, like, like you can't even. I played some shitty games where I download it. I stopped playing and within five minutes I'm like, fuck, this sucks. Like it just, you know, it sucks. Right. And rockstar games or just, you know, it sounds like I'm doing a spot for him, but uh, they're so above everything else. The animation, the, the sandbox quality where you're able to just run around and do shit like that's an appeal that I don't like feeling like they're on a track in a game and a certain games are like that, like a call of duty is very track based, you know, you play online a lot against other people. They're small maps, but a game like that you could just go off if you want to. You could just spend time fishing. Like you could just get tackle and go to a lake and fish and catch fish.

Speaker 1:          01:17:49       You catch fish. It's a. Yeah, you can just spend eight hours just catching fish, just fishing, hunting. You could go out and hunt. I've heard that you track like the bear and, and that motherfucker can you saw like can get you a. I love games like that though. I love open ended games. I always liked that shit. Even when I was um, back in the eighties, uh, my cousin got a atari 800 computer and it had a cartridge for a game called star raiders. And this was right after star wars came out. And I was fascinated because it wasn't just a joystick and a button that you got on an arcade game, it was you used the keyboard like for warp drive or you had a dock with a space station at one point and you're going in orbit around a planet. LIke there was all these things that you used the keyboard for.

Speaker 1:          01:18:40       And I thought that was amazing. Like I don't like just a running gun type thing. I like being able to use a lot of different keys and have a lot of options. How much time do you spend playing video games? Because I'm getting the impression it's insane. There have been days where I have a weekends or something where I have played from maybe 2:00 PM till 3:00 AM, like 12, 13 hours of playing it. It's no eating. Yeah. Yeah. I'll, I'll eat a little snack, a little snack. I'll order something or miss. You'll make something. She's playing viDeo games like I'll be playing on the computer and that's in front of me on the table I was talking about in the living room. And then on the big screen tv, which is in front of me on the wall, she sitting in like a folding chair with a tv tray playing red dead redemption on the xbox. So occasionally look back and go, oh, you got to see this great kills a video, a funny video of a couple engaging in virtual reality and they're having sex and the girls blowing the guy. And then the video, joeY diaz comes in the room.

Speaker 1:          01:19:51       That's hilarious. There was a. Well there is vr porn. Have You checked that out? I haven't. It's really interesting there. There is. There is some that is pretty amazing. Like a girl Will come up like you're laying on your back and a girl is in the room. She takes her clothes off and comes up on you and gets right by your ear and whisper something and, and you hear it, you almost feel the breath on you. It's that fucking crazy. And, and you, you feel like you can reach and touch, but you know, there's no one there. But. And again, you can't even get close to showing what it's like on a regular flat screen, but when you put that in, it's a real space. It's three d and they look pretty real aside from the resolution difference because when you, when you magnify something that close to your eyes, the pixels get bigger too. So it's not quite there. But you could see where that's going. You get that. And one of those fucking flashlights.

Speaker 3:          01:20:56       I used a really early, really early version of the htc vive many years ago. duncan had one, my friend duncan trussell had one in his house and it was really pixelated and it was very strange. It was just a real simple game and it was real blocky looking. It looked like like old doom or something like that. But it was in complete three dimensions. And so I was looking up and looking all around. I was like, wow, this is kind of crazy. And then I went back to his place like two years later and there had been a gigantic leap and them. And now the leap is sort of balanced out. It's not, it hasn't gotten that much better. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:21:31       Right yet. Yeah. There are a few games that I love playing on the oculus because it's like flying games are incredible. Um, and if you have a Really good system with a duel 10, 80 ti I graphics cards, one of them is insane to have and my assistant has two of them and so I could run everything on ultrasound.

Speaker 3:          01:21:56       Do you prefer videos on a computer?

Speaker 1:          01:21:59       Yeah, yeah, I, I prefer a pc, But I'll play on xbox and stuff. Uh, it's pretty cool. Uh, I'm terrible with a controller. Yeah, that's the problem. So mouse and a keyboard is so much more precise. I got a. Yeah. I always say I, if anyone ever argues, I go, I've never missed a folder on my desktop. I've never gone, oh shit, I missed it. But there's something called a, an ap zim apex that you plug into an xbox or playstation and then plug keyboard mouse into it. You're runnIng on xbox with a keyboard and mouse. So. And it's so good. I destroy people, uh, when I play on that because it's more accurate, so much more accuracy and you're just quick reflexes and yeah,

Speaker 3:          01:22:45       from the online video game days of the early two thousands and the nineties, like it was always.

Speaker 1:          01:22:51       Yeah. Yeah. Mouse and keyboard was, was It a console was for babies? They weren't good back then. Now curious. He was terrible. Yeah. I, uh, when I play some of the, um, like combat flying games, they have things now that are, you look like you're in the cockpit of a plane. All the gauges work. They have reflectIons of light coming through. I mean the ground looks amazing. And in vr when you pull the stick back and turn, because I use a joy stick and throttle. It's, it's amazing. Uh, you can look over your shoulder and now you're seeing your wing and the ground and you're pulling back and you get dizzy. Like you get so fucking dizzy and crashes are startling. Like like if you lose control and you plow into the ground, you kind of jump because it's, you're just, it's, I think it's that primal part of your head going, like accepting what it's seeing.

Speaker 1:          01:23:49       I wonder if there would be a really good way to learn how to fly. I would imagine it would be that guy that stole that plane up in portland recently slammed into the. Yeah, killed himself. He said he learned how to fly on a simulator flight simulator. Microsoft flight simulator x is like unbelievable. And he was doing like loop de loops in the sky and shit. He's like, let's see if we could do a loop. And he was saying I'm going to kill myself, right? Oh yeah, yeah. He's like, yeah, I think uh, I'll do a, I'll try to do a loop and then knows it in and call it a day what a maniac. But the fact that he could get access and take off like that is kind of scary. Whoops. We all think, uh, you know, everything so secure. Then when we thought there were like missiles on the roof of the white house and the pentagon and stuff, and then after nine, 11 and I.

Speaker 1:          01:24:38       Yeah, I guess not. Yeah, I guess that was all bullshit. The actual pentagon got hit by a fucking plane, although now you're going to get a lot of people writing this play, bro was. It was a mitchell. Everyone knows it. You're a gatekeeper. You're a shill, a shill for the eu. Um, it doesn't, uh, who, who does your show? That is a flat earth or eddie bravo. Eddie bravo. That's it. I don't know if he's still a flutter. You might've abandoned. He might've moved on. Let me think that still he thought the earth is a disk. Maybe he said, I think I don't want to misinterpret what he's saying. I don't want to misrepresent. I think he was saying he doesn't know, but he doesn't believe nasa because it's only someone's word over history and he likes that. He thinks it's fun. He just conspiracies.

Speaker 1:          01:25:29       Okay, well they are. Yeah, they are kind of fun. But that flat earth one I realized I was arguing with flat earthers on twitter and that's when I really started going like, what, what, what am I doing? What am I doing? Why am I engaging that debt is like the dumbest version of I know you are, but what am I for the rest of time? Yes. So stupid. That argument is, it's a it, it's crazy. I was talking, I was arguing with somebody and then I had my show to do and I'm neil degrasse tyson was taping his show in my studio before I came on. So he was in the lobby when I was in our greenroom when, when I was on and I started talking about it and I go, you know, let's get someone in here. Maybe that might have a, an opinion on this.

Speaker 1:          01:26:12       Neil degrasse tyson coming. And apparently he gets shit all the time from flat earthers saying that it's, you know, he's full of shit. No, it all started off as a goof. It had to just like everything else. But it started off on four. Chan did it like free bleeding. Yes, exactly. Which is hilarious. People explain that to people don't know free bleeding is a woMan's rights thing and it's a instead of using a tampon during their period or a pad, they just bleed through their pants and show it proudly that they will walk around bleeding and it was never real. It was neveR a real thing and then people saw it and thought it was real. Like they. They put it out there for chan and people actually believed and know not just believed it started. He started doing it. Yes. They started doing it for real.

Speaker 1:          01:27:00       They turned it into something women's rights, badge of honor to have a pair of white pants on with a giant patch of a brownish red in the center. It's insane. It's crazY. It just shows you how easily manipulated people are. Things that happen like that. UnfortunatelY it turned out to be goofs. They start out as goofs. Yeah. You know, and then they wIll listen. We were talking about this last song was with you, right? The proud boys. Gavin off as a goof and then became like, what the money. They won't let them in Australia now if you've seen that. No, it's, it's gotten insane. Yeah. Like gavin is considered a, like a war criminal at this point. Uh, I know gavin very well. He used to be on compound media, my, my network. Um, and that's where the whole thing started and just explain how it all started because people don't know.

Speaker 1:          01:27:53       It's, it's amazing when you think about it because it makes you question everything. Like how did, how did a nazi Germany stock, was that a joke? Was that like stalin, ism and everything? Uh, in Russia. Gavin, I had a show. Very outrageous. Gavin is one of these. Just a funny, outrageous guy. His whole career has been based on satire and parody and lots of provocateur. A provocateur. Absolutely. Yeah. Loves shaking. People are to find out where he really. Well, how he really feels and when he's playing games, right. It's very bLurry. Absolutely. So we have a, we have this employee, uh, ben ratner, little kid. We, we actually hired him just because his name was ratner and we wanted to call him rat, like in fast times a rent. Why don't you turn on the camera? Uh, so it was, it was great. Uh, he rat never talked about girls.

Speaker 1:          01:28:46       It's like this really jewish real red hair kind of gangly kid. And uh, he, he liked going to broadway shows and things and we always questioned his sexuality and whatnot. And gavin really started hitting on him going, what are you doing? Like get laid a kid, your age should be out there, you just fucking plowing through pussy. and he's like, I'm waiting for the right girl and everything. So gavin would continuously goof on him. So he, He would alwayS go to broadway plays. So gavin started getting a music from musicals and playing it to him like, hey, look at this, you pussy, you know, is this what you like? Uh, and one of them was proud of your boy. It's a broadwaY, a song from a musical, a disney musical, I believe. And it's celia. Oh, proud of your boy. It's one of those big grandiose broadway pieces of shit.

Speaker 1:          01:29:40       Can't stand that stuff man. I hate it. oh, it is, it's terrible. Uh, so he goofed on about that and then said we ought to make a club called the proud boys and that way you can learn how to be a man and you know, you, you'll get checks and tattoos and, you know, drink beer and hang out with guys as a joke. IT was like this parody of a men's club and so over the top that it was like, I think part of the way to get beaten into this gang, this club was that you had to recite five breakfast cereals while the other members punched you and, and they would keep punching you until you spit a soul. Ludicrous. So ridiculous. Such parody. Uh, and slowly this fucking thing mutated into some. It got more members. Uh, they started wearing one of those shirts, the with the yellow car Piping on the collar and stuff.

Speaker 1:          01:30:43       it's a specific shirt that became the uniform, perry ellis perry ellis shirts, a specific black shirt with gold piping and uh, on the collar and, and the, uh, the sleeves. And that became like the uniform. And because it was presented as a chauvinist club, like, like girls are allowed, minorities are allowed, it doesn't matter who you are, but in essence it is a guy thing and we will talk shit about girls and we're going to drink and get laid. And it was just a men thing. So they started getting together at bars, you know, in the area in manhattan. And how is this organized? It's organized through his compound media show, the compound media show, his own twitter account, and an facebook, which he subsequently lost. He's persona non grata on social media, but that's how it started. And it never was supposed to go any further than that.

Speaker 1:          01:31:40       Gavin himself didn't really take it any further than that. It's just, let's get together every so often we have a good time. We drink, laugh, everything like that. Well then this whole thing with politics got involved because antifa, which antifascist started, uh, uh, coming into a conservatives that wanted to speak. So gavin was conservative as conservative. He'd get speaking engagements at schools, nyu or, um, any, any, uh, numerous places around New York city and antifa would show up to protest him and try to shut down the event. So then the proud boys would go and protect gavin so he wouldn't get harmed doing these speaking engagements and that. So then it turned into this because they're fighting with antifa. They must be the fall, the fascists, nazis. Um, and once that gets out there, there's no pulling it back. You could try to explain how you're not a nazi till you're blue in the face.

Speaker 1:          01:32:46       It ain't going away. And especially because it's a good story. The press likes it. It's this good versus evil thing. They present antifa. I like their protest. They always call them and the protesters were beaten. Their fucking violent, violent group of people that are there to, to hit people they don't agree with and silence people that want to speak. And that's exactly what happened with gavin and ann coulter and milo yiannopoulos, uh, a ben shapiro, the, a lot of these conservative people can't go to these venues and speak. They get shut down because of a violent group of people called antifa. So proud boys were kind of the answer to that. So gavin can go around and actually, uh, speak. Well when that happened, more people came on board because they kind of liked to beat people up. When you have a gang, a group of people, and one of their missions is now to beat up people you don't agree with politically.

Speaker 3:          01:33:42       When there was there, there's tiers to the membership. Like the highest tier was you fought for the cause to actually get into a fistfight. Yeah. Yes. I'm sure gavin thought was like, I've talked to gavin. I'd like gavin, I've had gavin on the podcasts and the last time I had them on I didn't know what this whole thing was. And so he was explaining the proud boys and he was talking to me about, we're going to punch them. We're going to punch people. Yeah. I was like, whoa, whoa, whoa. And I was like, did you know you can't just punch people like they, they punched back and then you get mad that you punched them in and they shoot you when you get out of your car. This escalates. People don't just take it.

Speaker 1:          01:34:16       Well, it was never supposed to be an offensive punching. Uh, when, when I would speak to gavin and every example I would see it was an answer to violence. They, they would have violence perpetrated on them.

Speaker 3:          01:34:27       Proper context. And all bald needed to say is he's calling for violence. That's it. And that's what they've said about gavin over and over again, taking things out of context and use it as a gamble.

Speaker 1:          01:34:38       The other problem being that the antifa people are a lot of skinny dudes and chicks with masks on and they

Speaker 3:          01:34:48       that adept at fighting. There's a horrible video of this one antifa guy tries to hit someone with it looks like some kind of a stick or a pipe. Yeah. And the guy it and fucking

Speaker 2:          01:34:58       blasted him on the chin and fucking put him down. His head bounces off the concrete unconscious, which is a whole lot of people die. Yeah, yeah, exactly. That's how people die in fights like, oh, he killed them with his bare hands. Yeah. He hit his fucking head on. He hit his head on the concrete. You got hit by the world. Literally the world, right? Right. Gravity. The budge it. Gravity has punched you in the back of the head. So yes, these people have this idea that they're going to go places. They're going to shut everybody down and because they're in a group, you're going to scream and yell and hit people with bike locks and all this stuff that y'all seen. Weird thing is that that's from the left. That was never from the left before. When I was a kid. I grew up when I was eight, from eight slash seven slash 11 during the Vietnam war.

Speaker 2:          01:35:42       I lived in san francisco and I was around the real hippies and I remember being a little kid. I remember that moment of times like a flower children. I mean, they were the hippies and the lefties were were love and peace and no violence and everyone was doing acid and now they're all on adderall and they're hitting people with bike locks. It was, yeah, it's a different thing. There was a time where the liberals, the hippies, the, you know, they were the ones that when there would be a demonstration and the national guard would show up, they'd be putting flowers in. The barrels of the guns are famous pictures of that, and then kent state was a bunch of hippies literally getting shot by the national guard, the national guard that has completely flipped around. It's the weirdest thing and I don't know how it got distinguished.

Speaker 2:          01:36:33       We're proud boys became this evil group of people and an antifa is the good group of people. Now I understand that. Proud boy, a proud boys were infiltrated by white nationalist, nazi, white supremacist, whatever it is, but those were constantly being disavowed by gavin. Gavin never wanted any of that happening, but is there a way. How do you get in though? Here's the question, because this is my. You saw my last comedy special. This is my criticism of a vegans is not that there's anything wrong with being a vegan, is that when you have a group where anybody can join, you're going to get a certain amount of fucking idiots. If you have a million people for sure you have 100,000 fucking idiots. There's no getting around that. Yeah, so if you have a group where anybody can join and you have a million people in that group, you're going to have 100,000 fucking fucking idiots and those people are going to define your group. The worst behavior in that group is where people are going to call too as an example. That's it. I think this is also a symptom of the social media era today, especially with twitter because you can't express yourself and explain things 140 or 280 characters. It just takes too much time so they can say, oh, proud boys, racist scumbag nazi gavin, and they'll always racist gum back nazi. Then all of a sudden that's the narrative and everybody keeps pushing it and the videos of people punching

Speaker 1:          01:37:56       little skinny people. Oh, look at these people. They beat up the antifa, these fucking assholes, and gavin's an asshole. Yeah, that's, that's what it comes down to. I've seen it presented a. Well. You ask how it starts and how it grows and how you become a member by buying a fucking shirt, by buying a perry ellis shirt and opening a chapter to their chapters worldwide. You see it. It's like, here's the, the proud boys Australia. Here's the properties. England proud boys, fucking Japan, like it's everywhere and it never was supposed to get to that point and regardless of how these people act, it now reflects on gavin. Even though he wanted to hang out in a bar with a few people do is public speaking without being hassled. And that's it. And, and I see the way the media manipulates things. I've been party to it myself and I've seen gavin presented in photos where you look and go, holy fuck.

Speaker 1:          01:38:54       It's hitler. Liked like they get them. There's one picture, gavin, that I was petrified by. He's got his arms folded, he's got a scowl on his face, that hair, you know, the short on the side, long on the top and he's looking like, like he's angry and I'm like that, that stuff. The guy that him and his wife who is american indian by the way, his wife is american indian. He's got beautiful kids that come over my house and use the pool and we hang out and barbecue. I'm like, that's not that guy. No one knows that guy from the paper. They're getting this impression. He's a really nice guy. He's. He's a generous. Just a really cool guy to hang out with and what you see them do in the media is just crazy. Especially when you know he didn't invent some goddamn nazi group.

Speaker 1:          01:39:41       He was just trying to have a little outrageous fun and it ran from him. It got away from the origin of it though. The way you're describing that is fucking fantastic. Isn't that nuts? It's crazy that that is what presented it. I mean that, that emerged out of that. We, we, we fuck with rat all the time. [inaudible] we go. Can you believe the inspiration for the proud boys? Is this little jewish? Where is that guy? Photo of online. He. Oh, I'm sure there is rat compound media rat. You'll probably find them. Uh, it's. How much does this weird you out though? That compound media was the source of all this is weird. Like, and it's one of those things you worry about like, like I don't want to then be taught because I know how it works. I love gavin, but I don't want to be tied to the proud boys at this point. You know, I got my own fucking problems through history. I don't need any more piled on me. But what was that thing that I'd sent you? That. There he is. There he is. That's a rat. I guess that was halloween. Okay. You, what's this? I was wearing a suit that was, I was the mayor from jaws. Mayor von. I was for halloween. That's awesome. That's the guy that the proud boys.

Speaker 2:          01:40:54       The proud boys got 1938 propaganda posters. LIttle cutie isn't a norman rockwell painting. That's it. He should be there with like a guy who's handing them an apple pie. Yeah. Yeah. And that's, that's the face of the new nazi movement. I think that there's a lot of mistakes were made, but gavin's gavin's made some mistakes and like his, his whole thing of, of, of blurring the lines between parody and honesty. It's. He thinks it's fun. It's very punk rock. Like he came up last time. He's on the podcast, which is a few years back. He came on dressed like Michael Douglas from falling down. He had a briefcase. He brought the suit, like the short sleeve shirts like that all the time now. Like he goes around I, I just, I just did a skype interview with him yesterday, two days ago from the hotel room. And he. Yeah, he's got the pocket protector and the pens and the glasses.

Speaker 2:          01:41:51       Yeah, like falling down. He thinks it's funny, but people need to understand. And this is true. He is the godfather of the hipsters. Yeah. He'll put in godfather of hipsters. can google him, he comes up, all of that wardrobe the guys are wearing. They will. They look like they're wearing old tiMey suits with the skinny ties. Gavin mcinnes literally started that fashion trend in williamsburg and they. It took off from there that the hipster dress, the way people would dress with those weird mustaches and all that shit that literally came out of gavin gavin, which is amazing. The motherfucker is. He is a guy. There's something like magnetic about the guy. He is what a cult leader is like. He could Just start a cult, which in essence by accident he did between the hipsters and then this. He's one of those guys like, I like gavin, why don't you start?

Speaker 2:          01:42:45       Why don't you start a cult where you get to fuck the people's wives. Like that kind of cult, like why do you go with. We also did some really good interviews online where he would trIck these leftists into sitting down with him in interviews and then along the way there we're having this conversation. It would be exposed that he didn't agree with them at all and they were trapped like this hardcore feminist got trapped with them. A couple of other people get trapped in this room with him and they, they realized like halfway, like some of the line of questioning and the way he's approaching things. So like, oh my god, he's an interesting guy. He's very interesting. And outside of this voice thing of you never, never invented that. They never did any of that. He would be doing great. Yeah. Although he had a problem with one of one of his own companies that he made after vice, they bought them out of vice because uh, shane turned more liberal and it wasn't really, they weren't really a meshing anymore over their advice. So they kind of just bought out a gavin. He, he got a lot of money, decided to do his own thing. He, uh, had an firm, I guess

Speaker 3:          01:43:51       it was. Yeah. Uh, and then he got the boot from that for making a trans gender comments. We'll use opinion on transgender people have mental health, mental health issue. And he was brInging up all these. Here's the problem. He was, he was saying some things that are correct. Yeah. Interspersed with again, yesterday and sarcasm in his mind. This was like, just, this is something you can talk about where it was in the public side, particularly during the caitlyn jenner, the whole thing. people had decided the transgender was amazing. It's amazing, it's beautiful. She's incredible. And he was saying, no, these are people that are menTally ill and there's an a, there's a website that he was pointing to, I think it's called transgender regrets or something like that where they haVe all these stories of all these men who turned Into women and then turned back to men again.

Speaker 3:          01:44:40       Now they don't have dicks. No, they have to take testosterone injections and they hate their life. And there's some of them who did it like when they were in their sixties and now now they're in their seventies and trying to be a man again. And, and that gender dysphoria was thought to be a mental health issue. Like anorexia, like a lot, a lot of other. There's body dysphoria, but people have weird, um, you know, a bodybuilders credit, they, they, they never think they're big enough. You have like weird perceptions of their physical presence in there and some, uh, I had a psychologist, dr deborah, so who was discussing late onset gender dysphoria in autistic girls that autistic teenage girls, they don't feel like they fit in and people can convince them that they're actually a man. Wow. And so a lot of them start taking hormones and, and, and going through transition, massive regrets. And then unfortunately for women, when, especially when you're a teenager and you're going through puberty and you take hormones, you literally start developing male features. YoUr face gets harder and thicker and wider. Your shoulders get bigger, like the whole deal. Your hands. Yeah. Click gross. the size of a thumb you. So you make these irreversible changes or unless you know. So you just described jim norton's dream girl. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:45:59       This is a perfect. Jim norton is. I love him to death. He's a perfect example to have someone who's bulletproof because that's what he is. He's a, he's charming at like, like in his, his fucking debauchery. Uh, he's, he's a charming guy. Girls love him and think he's adorable at when he's saying some of the most heinous shit onstage and on the air and stuff. You know, where he's coming from. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, there's no mistaking it like he, he wears everything honestly. So, uh, he wrote the forward and in my book permanently suspended. He wrote, he wrote the foreword. He knows me, like it's my brother first and then jim norton. Yeah, like jim knows me really well. We're, we're really good friends and I love the guy. Why didn't you guys wind up doing a show together when opie and anthony crashed?

Speaker 1:          01:46:50       I, I think, look, I can't blame anybody because I think that having the security of a steady paycheck as opposed to the guy that just got thrown off of everything, opening, starting his own thing, uh, it probably wasn't all that appealing to jimmy who had just bought a new place in the city and everything. Is it just a, it wasn't the right time. And then, you know, as time went on, he became the go to guy over at sirius, um, from the opiod anthony show. So, uh, I would love to, and I do is chip, chip recent show and you know, we're doing, we're doing one in philly next week at the live show. Yeah. We've been doing these live shows on long island. We did one up in boston and it's hilarious jokes. He comes out and the crowd goes fucking wild and he's got to be in character the whole time.

Speaker 1:          01:47:42       It's got to kill them. It's got a killer. And it's so much fun to do. I love playing the straight guy cohost to his fucking insane character. But uh, yeah, we've done these live shows and they're, they're really a lot of fun. Um, and he's just a fucking. Oh my god, it's so ridiculous. He's gotta stay and look at those pants. Yeah. Places like packed and it's crazy. You guys reading, what are the notes? Oh, he, he wanted us to. He wrote, he wrote like a, uh, almost a play, but it's all just kissing chips ass and how wonderful chip is. And how thankful we are to be there. Like it's so goddamn funny. I love it. He's a, he's a brilliant man. He's just A great guy. And very fuckIng funny. I knew from the first. I think that also kind of. I'm not blaming jimmy or anything, but I think that helped to kind of break up the o and a show in time.

Speaker 1:          01:48:48       I think opie started resenting the little bit of that comradery that me and jimmy were having. Um, me and jimmy kind of slowly started pulling away and doing our own thing like it was. And the humor is, you know, the, the more twisted the better. I love sick humor. He does too. and we laugh. We did a whole bit on, on like lacy peterson and Scott Peterson that the murder. Yeah. And you would think like, obviously he murdered his pregnant wife and dumped in the ocean. What could possibly be funny about that? Well, people wrote trIbute songs with this guy wrote a tribute song to her and it another one of these self centered assholes that thought he was going to go viral by making a attributes. And we started changing the words to the song to make it just horrible involving seaweed and things, so it was terrible.

Speaker 1:          01:49:38       But me and jim are literally crying, laughing, and oh, at least just kind of sitting there, like not really able to jump in or not kind of getting why we're laughing at this sick shit. Uh, so it kind of pushed us further apart. Um, at that point. Yeah. We, we both as people changed over the course of the 20 years we worked together 20 fucking years with anybody do. If this is nuts, you got a girl that's suck your dick every day for 20 years you're going to be like, oh fuck, stop sucking my dick. But now it's, think it's open across from me, you know? Yeah. Uh, so you're going to get on each other's nerves. And I'm not innocent in the whole thing either. Uh, but I was, I'm a lot more laid back. Like I, I knew what real work was. I worked for fucking living.

Speaker 1:          01:50:27       I did heating and air conditioning installation and it was freezing cold in the winter and boiling hot in the summer. And when I got that first gig and radio because of opie and I'll always thank him for that. Uh, I knew what it was like to work and I didn't want to fuck that up. So I plasTered a smile on my face at every turn and did the show four hours a day. Everyone has someone at work that they don't get along with. You don't leave the old fucking, you know, you just deal with it. And that's eight hours. I had another 20 hours of the day that didn't involve greg opi hughes so I could deal with it. Uh, he was more like, he had a express himself a little more, which I guess is healthy in a way. But uh, I didn't need to, so I didn't, I didn't text him.

Speaker 1:          01:51:14       I didn't call him. I uh, he, we got into an argument once and he goes, dude, you never even been to my house. And I go, alright, get everyone from the show in here. Jim, have I ever been to the house? Nope. Travis? No. Sam, no. Iraq. No. I've never been to anyone's house. Let me tell you something right now. Yeah, that's something much chick would say. I know that when my house toad, it's exactly that. Been in my house. What does that mean? What does that even mean? I never been africa. What the fuck are you saying? I've never been to Spain. What does that have to do with anything that if, if you had a problem with me not coming to your house, why didn't you ask me to come to your house? Yeah. Like is there like a you asking me everyday and I'm saying no.

Speaker 1:          01:51:55       Was saying no. Right, right. What's going on? It was always something like that. And believe me, I'm not gonna sit here and shit on the guy. I that my shows for that, uh, I'm not gonna fucking around. I'm not going to sit on the guy. But there were definitely personality quirks and that I guess we both had. But there was something like if, if I, I would party all the time and, and you know, I had to be there at 6:00 AM and I'm driving from roslyn long island to New York city. It's, it's 25, 30 miles of just fucked traffic every day. He had to take you to get there. It could be 35 minutes, it could be an hour and a half based on if someone's pulled over on the side of the road, some asshole crashes in queens, whatever it was. It was, uh, it was a shit drive every day and you had to be there at six, right?

Speaker 1:          01:52:43       Six o'clock the show started. And so even at six they'd be that kind of traffic. Yeah. Yeah. It wasn't as bad as it got, like seven or eight, but you never really knew. It could, it could. I was never late late, but there were times I'd come in at five, after eight, after six was pretty much as late as I would, I would be. It was never more than that. But he would go like, he never had to say anything like the music starts. There's a little a bumper at the beginning and by the time it starts, I, I'd sit down and he on mike would go, um, well, I guess there was traffic anthony just getting in and other bosses are listening and it was, it just wasn't necessary to do that, you know, it, it kind of. I was like, you wanted something, you got to be guys don't do that, guys don't do that to each other.

Speaker 1:          01:53:33       You fucking sit down. Don't say a word. No one would know I'm late, you know. And that's what happened. And it, there were instances like that all the time. It's all in my book, permanently suspended. Uh, there's that book out now. It's out now. A border's barnes and noble and we think we have a copy of the green. Oh yes. Very good. Uh, but, but I taught something. Somebody's house. It's in my house. I talk a lot about obviously the relationship and, and uh, with opie and, and how it kind of slowly, uh, came apart at the seams, I think toward the end. Uh, he just had had it. He didn't want to do a show with me anymore. I don't think you want to do a show with jimmy either. That didn't last long and I knew it wasn't going to last long and they, I was the buffer between the two of them.

Speaker 1:          01:54:21       That ended bad. It really did. It really did. Uh, have you talked to jimmy about it? Like he doesn't, he doesn't express that kind of. No, no. He doesn't like jimmy's a very loyalty driven guy. Uh, like he takes that very seriously and if he feels somebody fucking with him, he really gets pissed. Uh, usually it can get talked out and everything's cool after a little while. Uh, but this one, uh, this, this work. Yeah. No, no. I think honestly, the way you guys interacted with each other, what he was good for was sort of directing the whole thing. That's the impression that I got and I mean, how many times I do the show? Dozens, right? Yeah. Yeah. I mean how many times it did it. Absolutely. But I always felt like what he did really well was sort of guide things like, sit back more.

Speaker 1:          01:55:13       Let you guys be funny, but, but guide, like, figure out like maybe we need more of this, maybe we need more of that. There was real value to that. Absolutely. But do you think that's fun when you go out and do an appearance and everyone's clamoring about a bit that me and jimmy did or something for him. Yeah. And he's sitting there going like, well, I, I pushed a button and I drove the ship and I went to spots and if he knew it's, it's, it's funny because like, yeah, you're not going to be appreciated as much, but it's like a guy who, uh, is good at defense, but he doesn't score a lot of points. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You're not going to be lebron james. It's necessary guys who score the points though, or the ones who everybody wants to talk to you, you know?

Speaker 1:          01:56:00       Yeah. You ever see? Uh, I, I Think of opiod, like, um, you ever see the prestige, the movie the prestige, uh, with the, the two magicians know and it, it, it's, it's a good movie. It's a good movie, but at one point, uh, because he has to use a body double, uh, the actual magician has to drop below the stage and the body double comes out and gets all the applause and he's under the stage. The real guy that did the whole act is under the stage and he shuts his eyes and puts his arms out, like trying to enjoy the adulation from the fans, but it's not even him getting it. And I think that kind of mindset was there. There's. And then resentment starts bubbling up and you start doing things like saying, anthony just got in, um, you, you hold things over people's heads.

Speaker 1:          01:56:55       the contract negotiations were a nightmare every time. And opiate always wanted a one year deal. I'm like, what the fuck are you doing? Let's sign for 10 years. Who gives a shit? You know, if they want to fire they're gonna fight it anyway, the contract or not, but let's lock them in. So if something happens, at least we have a, uh, a settlement portion, we can take half the, what they owe us for five years, whatever it is. Not one year deal, that's all I want because he always had this delusion of grandeur, like there was always something better waiting for us to grab up and it's like the truth of the matter was the glory years of the o and a show were gone. The new year's and the, you know, all that crazy fucking radio. We were damaged goods after the sex in st patrick's cathedral debacle.

Speaker 1:          01:57:42       We had a couple, um, we had a contest where people had to go around New York city and have sex at, at various famous locations with the hard rock cafe and um, empire state building, things like that. And we had spotters who were comics or people that work for the show, follow them around and they would call us on the show and go, all right, we're here at the empire state building and he's doing it. I'm watching them right now. So we had paul mecurio who was a comic and he, uh, was following one couple of round and a opiate put church on the list. Um, and I went like, ooh, I dunno man. He goes, it's just to read on the air and say like what locations are, and when we say church, people go like, oh, dr ranges, but no one's going to go to church.

Speaker 1:          01:58:23       Don't worry. Well, paul calls up and goes, well, we're here at st pat's and he's doing the two point conversion. you've got an extra two points if you were fucking her in the ass at the location because they all had point values for how dangerous it was. A pat was watching to be sure that it went in the house. Paul paul was watching. Yeah. Yeah. the spotter was supposed to watch and to watch this guy. Fuck has grown the ass. Yeah. Yeah. There was a lot of theater of the mind going on to who knows what the fuck they were doing or where I heard. I hear it was in the vestibule outside st pat's, but regardless it's sex at st pat's and a nope. We looked at each other. We both had digital delay, like the delay button. A seven second. We have like a 32nd delay.

Speaker 1:          01:59:09       We both had buttons in front of us. There was another guy in a locked room down the hall that had a button to dump out of because we were constantly doing shit that would have gotten fcc complaints. So the boston stalled these buttons everywhere while we both had our finger on it. Con like, shit, do we punch out of this? It's hilarious guys. Fucking his girl in the ass at st pat's a and neither of us hit the button and the guY down the hall didn't hit it. We just went with it at that moment. It's like, that is one of those moments like talk about a defining moment. You move your finger one inch down and that never happens. It's amazing to think about. What year was this? A 2002, I believe. 2,000. It was, yeah, we, it was nine slash 11. Uh, we, we went through nine slash 11 on the air and stuff.

Speaker 1:          01:59:58       And then I guess that summer maybe. What year did you guys wind up on xm? A 2004, I think it was. We had to sit out two fucking years out of our contract. Uh, not working. They didn't want us to go to mornings because a clear channel radio, which was another radio company and cbs were, we're kind of fighting for us, a clear channel wanted us to do mornings against howard stern who was on cbs. Uh, we worked for cbs at the time doing afternoons, so we, we were put in a position where they were both just throwing huge amounts of money at us. Uh, and cbs was like, we can't let them go to morning, so we, it would be impossible to beat howard, but we would take enough listeners away where he might not be number one anymore. That affects revenue, you know, you want to, you want to sell the show as the number one rated show.

Speaker 1:          02:00:50       Uh, so cbs was doing anything they could to keep us in afternoons with the same company as howard. Uh, so it was the most lucrative contract we ever signed. It was a three year deal. We signed it in I guess 2001. And uh, after one year they canceled the show because of the sex at st pat's thing that blew up. I mean, it was in the newspapers, it was, I had to look at opi and dopey on the front page of. I'm like, fuck, I'm dopey, dopey. I was so embarrassing. My family and everything. It was just fucking nuts. So, uh, the cbs was like, well, we canceled your show, but we're not letting you out of your contract. Like, what does that mean? We talked to our agent and he goes, well, you can't work. They'Re not letting you work. You'll still get paid and do it.

Speaker 1:          02:01:38       I'm talking of dollars. This was millions of dollars that they had to give us for two years. But you think like, oh, that's awesome. And back then there was no internet to speak of. Like, like you had no way to contact your fans. Well, you could have a website, which is what are the ways that we became friends as I wrote about you guys, right? Yeah, yeah. I wrote a big piece on my website about how it was. Yeah, yeah. A lot of people supported us, but it got a. In two years you'd just disappear on the radio. It's if you're not doing a show and you're out there, you will go away, they will find something else. So we were really worried about that. And again, damaged goods. So no one was really clamoring to hire us anyway, but we went through two years where I was just making huge amounts of money and just find toys.

Speaker 1:          02:02:31       I would go. I went to atlantis for a couple of weeks ago in The Bahamas and I was literallY, I was pulling my luggage to leave at the, uh, the desk and I go to my chick, I go, what do we, where are we going home? He goes, okay. I said, can I have the room for another two weeks? Like, okay, went back upstairs and just stayed for a month. I have no reason why am I going home after two weeks, you're so conditioned like how long a vacation is and, and that lasted for two years. And then a satellite came calling, which was we considered radio prison. At that point it was radio jail. Anybody that, because everyone that had fucked up and regular radio ended up in satellite, like no one wanted to be in satellite radio at the time. They had no subscribers. Me and opie sat on the side of, uh, the, the belt parkway once by my house in brooklyn.

Speaker 1:          02:03:23       And we were like, let's see how many satellite radio antennas we see because they used to be very obvious shark fin, big antennas, aftermarket. They stuck them and drilled them into your roof. It was terrible. The installation process was stupid. No one wanted to get fucked their car up with this dumb antenna. So we're looking at when like nothing. And then, oh look, there's one. And you know, the money's one thing obviously, but as a broadcaster you want to fucking be talking to people you know, you want, you want to entertain people, you want people to say, wow, that was good. And there was just no subscribers back then during our 10 years there. It wound up getting very, very good. And, and, uh, we had a lot of listeners, but early on, no one but satellite was calling. And, uh, we, we signed, we signed the deal, um, but we, we definitely would have preferred terrestrial radio.

Speaker 1:          02:04:17       Yeah. It's interesting now, right? Because now satellIte satellite became a big thing when howard got on it [inaudible] and people were talking about it and then it became a big thing because every new car you buy you'd get a free 90 days or whatever. But now no one gives a shit. Yeah, it's, it's one of the short lived technology's, not that it's gone. I think it'll always be there in some capacity. Man. It is fucking clinging by a thread. So many other, um, that's why they bought pandora. I guess there's so many other streaming outlets out there. And the fact in podcasts, the fact that podcasts are all free. Yeah. Yeah. And then you can play them in a tunnel, right? It doesn't peter out on ya. And uh, you know, you get that signal constantly now. So it's, it's not like the old days a, every time you get in the car, like your system identifies your phone and then links up with commercials.

Speaker 1:          02:05:16       I remember when theY started playing commercials, like, what the fuck is this? I'm paying so that you can play commercials. He ouT of your fucking mind. Yeah. That was a. It was supposed to be a commercial free. They all talk about commercial free and then it ends up. Oh, if you listen into seven days on seven, I guess you want to have to listen to a commercial. But I think they have commercial. Yeah. They started throwing commercials on everything. So yeah. Yeah. Short lived, uh, technology. It's weird. And then to put all of your eggs in a couple of baskets that are circling the earth always seemed weird to me that you can't get it in Hawaii. I think I told you guys when I went, I went to hawaiian vacation. I got a car that had sirius xm built into it. It didn't work.

Speaker 1:          02:06:01       Yeah. Yeah. What the fuck is this? You have to deal with a satellite orbiting the, you know, something happens to the transmitter on a terrestrial station. They send an engineer up there. He turns a few screws or what have you. You know, something fucks up in a satellite. What are you going to do? You know, howard gonna get an a rocket and fix the fucking dumb technology at this point. Yeah. Yeah. totally. Unnecessary, unnecessary effect that sirius is still transmitted from a thing in the sky down to the ground. Yeah. Yeah. And then it's transmitted from the people on the ground up into the sky and then back down to the people on the ground. Yeah. That's what's going on. It's just so unnecessary. Just the people on the ground could just send it to the people on the ground, on the ground. Why wouldn't you do breezy?

Speaker 1:          02:06:46       Yeah. Especially in this day and age with the. But they still doing it. It's very weird. Yeah. Yeah, it is. They're going to have to do soMething. The model, I don't know, like I said by pandora, maybe start scooping up a internet companies, but they're going to do. I think they're going to move towards that direction. Yeah. I think that's all. You know what's really weird though, it's like the Fucking am radio is still a thing like, like that's the weirdest thing to be. The death knell for radio has been a, it's been forever, like the second another technology came out. IT was like, well I guess that's it for radio and television. We have a, an amazing invention. yeah. And radio was supposed to be dead but it's just hangs in there. People just can't let it go. Regular radio, especially a am

Speaker 2:          02:07:36       man. I remember as a kid, my dad having the agm or like music on the am radio sounded like was coming out of a tin can static and shit. And that was kind of all you had. I drove home a look like a year ago and just on a goof I decided to uh, put on am radio and I was listening to an am radio show and I had a big smile on my face all the way home because it was like I was listening to the past. Yeah. Yeah. it's like a time machine. Right? I was some weird. One of the local talk shows a weird local talk show in la where they were talking about traffic and the dodgers game and this and that. It's archaic. It's so strange. Like first of all, anything with anything that is trying to inform you is just unnecessary at this point.

Speaker 2:          02:08:22       Unless it's fake news, the big cnn and fox news and everything. Those will always be a fixture and stuff, but local fucking news. Do you really need the, the the team that cares at 6:00 and it's all just shit that you've already seen online. There's not one story that will be on the 6:00 news that I don't already know in depth. It's also the lowest rung of show business in terms of competence. People that they're terrible at it and they're all drunks. It's hilarious, dude. I have never seen a group of people that can drink more than fucking newspeople. They. They just get hammered on instantly are miserable. I think that's it. I think they're miserable. Went through a whole thing when roseanne was supposed to be on the podcast and right after she got fired, she announced she was going to come on the podcast.

Speaker 2:          02:09:16       These fucking news casters started showing up where our old studio is actually. They went to our old studio and they were parked out front with cameras and this is where I got. I got upset. I was like, first of all, you guys are terrible at this, and second of all, you just assume that because you're there, I have to talk to you [inaudible], so because you see me, I'm going to say something to you because you put your camera and your microphone face. It doesn't work that way. Fuck face. I'm not going to talk to you. You're not good at talking. This is the reason why you do this job like a really good job doing this because you're not good at this. You're not good at it. You will one day get a really good job doing this or you're just not good at it.

Speaker 2:          02:09:55       Yeah. One of those, because right now you're right here and I'm not talking to you. This is nonsense, like you're holding this fucking camera. Hi. We're here with cbs for news. Fuck outta here. I don't have to talk to you because you have a camera in front of me. Doesn't mind. We're going to have an interview now. Sometimes they feel like you're obligated to address them. Trying to come to my house. Yeah. Yeah. I've had that happen. It's not fun. It's definitely not fun. My neighbors, I'm not talking to you. They knocked on my neighbor's doors and they want to know about me and stuff and if you think like, like we deal with la or New York, imagine what the news team in fucking east allah bum fuck like. That's gotta be the worst. They are just terrible at what they do. Terrible local news in some podunk fuck town is hilarious to watch.

Speaker 2:          02:10:46       It's one of the things that comics have to do when they come into town to do local tv shows. Morning the morning chats out thing as shitty as you think the vieW is the talk. As shitty as though shows morning America fucking pens get together on these shows in like the local one in boise, Idaho or dallas, they're a thousand times worse, worse, just terrible death. And, and I, I hate that there's such a double standard when one of them fucks up, when a newsperson fucks up, they just apparently leave them alone. Like where was everyone with a. What's his name from, from uh, an. Was it nbc? Brian williams? Well, Brian Williams, they kinda got on. Uh, but uh, no. Uh, lauer. Matt lauer. Oh yeah. Like matt lauer. It was in the news or anything. But where was, where was the mike being shoved in matt lauer's face as he's trying to fucking go home or stuff that, there was some of that.

Speaker 2:          02:11:42       I think he just hid. I mean he went straight to long island and went to the hamptons and he's never left, but where theY camping out in front of his house like they did, they were, yeah, they just, he's just been banging divorces and riding a motorcycle to trying to get back on tv. That is just stunning to me is how much money he made. Oh yeah, yeah. Like I didn't know he was making that much money. Like that is insane. And for Years for a long fucking like a giant ranch in New Zealand, it's like thousands of acres and you decide you need that. It's so crazy because he's got a, some access issues like the people that want to get to certain parts of the uh, public land they have to go through his ranch. So there's like a, an access issue like some sort of easement where these people were supposed to be able to drive through and they're fighting it off and he should just sit at his desk with that button that opens the door.

Speaker 2:          02:12:34       But it lists a gate up so theY could get through that button. There's a misconception about that button. They all had that button. Yeah, that was. Yeah, it was because they had big offices and they want to be able to lock their doors suddenly interrupted on a phone call. He wasn't, so they could bang chicks in the office, like women executives had that button to. Oh, okay. Yeah, but that's the thing that sounded very audrey, audrey and d. The media grabbed onto that and like, oh my god, he had a button, the lock it. You sit in there. When I fuck around being our rep that I want to fuck on, I hit that button and just start fucking some nervous girl. Just seals that click goes, oh fuck. He hit the button. There was a lot of that. That was accentuated like there was a one guest that brought in a bunch of sex toys and he went back and he kept it in his office and he was like, oh, he keeps a bag of sex toys in his office.

Speaker 2:          02:13:25       Like this shit in this office. I got a flame thrower. Okay. Elan gave me a flame thrower. Yeah. What am I going to do with it? It's right there by the flame thrower in his office. Yes. It's that kind of thing, like if somebody gave me a bag of dildos, it will be right over there next to the flame thrower. He has a bag of cheetos. I made a conscious decision to throw it away, or my wife found it. It would wind up getting tossed, but matt lauer decided to keep it in his fucking closet. Yeah. Apparently he gave some people some. I think the guy was getting laid. Yeah. That's what I think. And I think a lot of what else happened. The, all the, the details of it. It seems to me that it's all of it is like very blown out of proportion.

Speaker 2:          02:14:08       I don't like that, uh, that that's happening because everyone is being lumped into the harvey weinstein category, which is the, that's the tip of the pyramid right there. The tip, right? Right. Cosby is literal one. Yeah. He's literally number one. There was a woman who said this on, I believe it was cnn or one of those talk show. She said, he may very well be the biggest serial rapist in history. You even fucking build car. Literally sitting back on my couch going, fuck, bill cosby's the biggest serial rapist industry. Wow. A time machine would be wonderful just to see people's expressions when you tell him like what's happening in the whole, a celebrity, a forum, like like why? What's cosby's doing? Have you seen a photo of howard cosell standing next to bruce jenner and oj simpson oj and it says, I've seen the future and you're not going to believe this fucking crazy.

Speaker 2:          02:15:11       Because we. When we were kids, we used to watch the cosby show when it was, when he was bill cosby, the standup comedian that will go on hbo and everybody loved him. He was america's america's dad right there. The cosby show, revolutionary on television. He was at that time raping women at that time. It's insane. Not just raping them, but drugging. Yeah. Yeah. And it in and friends, daughters liKe he knew. Come on over. I'll help you with your career. Wow. Plump. Yeah. Dropped two in your fucking drink and you feeling okay. Put your feet up, put your feet up, and they'd be like, okay, I'll move it. Good. That's when I stick my dick in your mouth. In that hazy, like a few of them just hazely regained consciousness for a minute and just remember seeing old bill pound in a way with that fucking flounder.

Speaker 2:          02:16:03       I think he got the I later in life apparently. Yeah. Yeah. I think, I'm not sure. I thought they were using that as kind of a sympathy thing, but he looks pretty fucking blind him to the same jail they sent whitey bulger. Oh wow. How about that bucket bags? Full light and he's a. He was, what, 95 or something like that. Why do you build culture? Was he that? I think it was that fucking all, like in his nineties. That's all. That's a gRudge that someone held onto for quite a while while the guy hated rats apparently. And that was the thing that whitey bulger all throughout hiS time of running the irish mob was ratting people out the air. That's what was really crazy. He was another guy just like we were tAlking about. Um, uh, the fuck's his name. The italian guy? Yeah.

Speaker 2:          02:16:48       Gotti got no. The other one. Oh no. He was in the mob. Ratting out other people in the mob while he was murdering people. yeah. Yeah. Like the fbi allowed him to sell drugs and do a lot. He won the lottery twice while he was doing this, you know, how that works and how the [inaudible] would win the lottery and he would use that as a way to show income. So he would pay them for their lottery ticket or steal it from him or whatever they did it. And then he would say, look, I won the lottery and then he would win the lottery so that when he would have all this money laundered, it could avoid tax evasion charges. That way I'll get proof of income. Doesn't want to get that boat. Where'd you get that cadillac? Where'd you get that house? Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Speaker 2:          02:17:35       That's, uh, that's fucked up twice now. Both live to win it twice. He was, uh, yeah, he, he was, uh, the fbi was helping him too. Obviously they were given up competitors and uh, well they, they, they were responsible probably for some murders. Yeah. Yeah. they would bring people to him like that. That was the thing like, hey, we're not going to kill anyone but we'll bring this guy to you so you could have a little chit chat and you know, you're driving the guy to, to his death. Pretty much. So he was living in an apartment in santa monica with some girl, just talked a lot. And apparently she was yelling at him and that's, that's how he got arrested. Like it, like a domestic. There was some screaming and yelling and they were weird and that was what got people looking at them like who the fuck are these people?

Speaker 2:          02:18:23       And then they start. I mean, he wasn't even the like hide in Montana or anything. No, no, it wasn't even rigHt out there on a ranch somewhere in the middle of nowhere when no one's going to be suspicious. He's in fucking santa monica in an apartment that is fucked up. Crazy. I don't understand like, how it's got to be the, the most stressful life to lead. Just on the run. I watched that, uh, some of those shows like cold case files and uh, when they find these people, you know, the inmateS are saying about the brutal prison hit on What he boulder chop chop off the tongue. His eyes out. Oh my god. That's like 89 or 89. Jesus christ. Yeah. It's definitely got what he had coming to them. It shouldn't. I don't see how anybody could argue that apparently so no sympathy. He says shit. Just amazing. And he's 89. Made it to 89. 80 nine. What was patrice like 40 when he died? Yeah. Yeah, yeah. How's that work? I, I have no idea. But yeah, I mean he, he been

Speaker 1:          02:19:28       looking over shoulder constantly while still in his wheelchair. He was beaten to death with what inmate call shank schlocks a lock in a sock that is kind of a dr seuss weapon while in his wheelchair before possibly having his eyes pow partially gouged out with shanks. Oh fuck. That's some real sandlands tried to chop off his tongue. Wow. Sometimes it works. Sometimes jailhouse justice actually happens. You don't, you don't. Uh, you don't think it will. But then it does sometimes, sometimes, sometimes, sometimes people get what's coming to them. How do we get on the subject of why the boundary? I don't know. We always, we just ramble about this stuff. They love it. So I love that you've established your own sort of media company. I love that you decided to start your own network, but is it, is it, are there challenges like what we do is pretty simple because we just put it out there and then we put ads on it.

Speaker 1:          02:20:29       Right. You know, and, or youtube puts ads on it. But is it, is it challenging to like, I mean you, you have a bunch of people. Like when I was there, other folks were coming in and they had their shows in the studio as well and they had you changed your green screen, you know, you should change the most convenient way to kind of. Instead of having a different set for every show, it's a green screen and then we just pop it in a pop in the background. We could do some pretty funny things with it too. We've done that. I did a reading last week of a part of my book and uh, we went to an establishing shot of a cabin and I moved to a chair behind the green screen and it's just made by a little fire burning and I. Oh, welcome.

Speaker 1:          02:21:09       I didn't, I didn't expect you and you know, so it's kind of fun to be creative with the thing. Um, other than that, yeah, there are a lot of challenges. It's a I, I am not, I am in front of the mic guy. That's it. I don't really like any of the other parts of the business. This, it, it's weird because this is the ceo of the business or I'm the guy. Keith though is the guy. I've delegated a lot of the responsibility as to the tech end of everything and uh, finding the people we need to run equipment and stuff over the course of the years and it's worked out very well. Um, but, but it is one of those things. It's, it's two companies. You have the entertainment that's going into the microphone and then all the shit you need to get that to the people.

Speaker 1:          02:21:55       And the business model and, and you know, billing and all that shit that I can't fucking be bothered. I have video games to play. I can't be bothered with that shit. So you operate on, it's a subscription. People pay by the month and you get a ton of shows. They get the Mike Ward show. Yeah. Yeah. Uh, Mike Ward, who was in here last week. Yeah. And they get a aaron and gino doing in hot waters, our morning show and they are just out of fucking control. They're the one show that I watched sometimes they go like, oh really? Wow. That's, I wouldn't do that. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh yeah. Yeah. They're brutal comics. Uh, yeah. Yeah. The comics in uh, in New York and then they tour around. I'm really funny guys. Then, um, so this is the, this is the page with all show on it. Yeah. I, I pilfered a bill schultz and joanne know socinski from fox news.

Speaker 1:          02:22:44       They used to be on fox news, a red eye and stuff. East side. Dave is a, an insane motherfucker from the old ron and fez show what's in hot water. And hot water is the morning show. That's a. Yeah, that's aaron and gino. Kevin brennan, who is just a mental patient. Uh, kevin's scares me. He yells a lot. I, I come into the studio and I just hear his voice booming, yelling and I get an anxiety attack. Like it's my dad yelling at mom back in, in the, in the old days a. Yeah. It was just a, uh, you know, we, we were always looking for a many shows you have on shows that fit. I don't know how many that is available to stream. Like anytime you want. Yeah, yeah. Every show. Most of the shows go out live. I like the element of just a little danger there of, of being live as it goes out.

Speaker 1:          02:23:35       I like that. I don't know what it is, but just knowing you could edit something might make you a little lazy as you're doing it. You can't stop. You have to keep calling. Jamie brought it up like it feels different and we've done shows that aren't live. Yeah. Yeah it does. If something happened with streaming at one point in time, we fucked up and we couldn't stream, so we just edited it and put it or a filmed in advance rather than put it up later. But it was like, is this field feels weird? It does. It's because there's a net. There's a net down there. You could, you could leave. If you had to take a piss, you could go, hey, I gotta take a piss. I go, you know, this is, you're going out like, this is it. Hi. Hey, here it is a.

Speaker 1:          02:24:13       I like, I like that. Yeah. That's something that there's a feeling that there's people listening right now, right? Yeah. And everything's archived. So a subscribers can get a all the past shows from all the channels available. Can they download audio as well as video? Yeah, yeah. Audio only, um, uh, audio and video. Yeah, it's, it's a, we give a lot of options. Uh, we went with subscriber based because when I got the boot from a serious years ago, uh, I couldn't imagine people want me to be hawking their products in the first place. Uh, and, and I didn't want to be beholden to sponsors, I can't have anyone telling me what I can and can't say anymore, just ain't going to happen. But is there an issue trying to get people like, uh, I had a friend who was on radio and they left and went to do a podcast nana subscription podcast.

Speaker 1:          02:25:08       Yeah. And he, what he was saying is, it's really difficult to grow. Look, you have to keep those people that you have to keep them happy and he, they would do things to engage with them and they would do like little events where they'd go to a bar, meet everybody and do a show from there. He said, but it's really hard to grow because people don't want to pay when there's all these different shows they could just get for free. Yeah, that's a, that's always a challenge. But there's also the commodity that people can't get anywhere else is entertaining. Shows like you could have a free show that sucks and there's plenty of those out there. Uh, but if you're good at what you do and you already have an audience, because I say it all the time, corola had the greatest line once he was being interviewed in so and said, uh, how do you, how do you make a successful podcast?

Speaker 1:          02:25:58       He goes, oh, okay. Rule number one, be famous. And I was like, yeah, you gotta. So I figured if we get up and running in a month, and then keith, uh, figured it out that we could hold onto a lot of the o and a audience that would come over and subscribe. Get it quick, get up. Yeah. And that's why. Thank god I had that studio already built in my basement. Yeah. I was able to. All we needed was the logistics of, of pumping it out onto the internet in a bigger number than I was doing at three in the morning. Were doing some of them outside too. Yeah, yeah. We'd set up the camera out by the pool. Like my first guest was dice, which was hilarious. Yeah. Yeah. Dice came by, we sat by the pool and then later on he went downstairs in my basement, I that karaoke stage and he was singing elvis karaoke songs.

Speaker 1:          02:26:46       It was hilarious. And that's one of those voluntary like dice is in my basement singing. Elvis did that fucking awesome. Uh, but yeah, so, so that model works for us and it's been working, but I'm kind of seeing a, you gotta keep on your toes in especially a technology based business. We were just talking about satellite radio, like you don't, you just can't tell what's going to happen. You really gotta kind of look for future trends and whatnot. And uh, maybe more of a hybrid thing because it's a balancing act of bringing new people in and like you said, keeping the people that are there already, but bringing new people in with some free content. So maybe get tiered subscription thing where there is a free level with sponsors. Uh, but then a tiered, a premium level with the material that we've already had. Maybe a past shows or something or extra content.

Speaker 1:          02:27:41       But, so we're, we're always trying to think of what might be a good option. When I first fired this thing up, we had no fucking clue. I mean this was usually, you would kind of do some kind of a research testing or whatever, marketing analysis of day parts and shit like that. And I just was like, I could, I could be here by 4:00 PM. How long is this show going to be? Six. Two hours. Four to six. I could, I could go out at six and then I don't have to be there until 4:00 PM. It's fucking easy. Still lets me party a monday through friday. Fuck that. I want the three day weekend all the time for the rest of my life. So that's what we do monday through thursday. And then we have programming on friday in the slot that I'm supposed to begin, uh, during the week.

Speaker 1:          02:28:31       So it just, I wanted, I didn't want to fucking be driving myself like that forever. So cut back on the hours, the days and it worked. So, you know, I'm very happy with that. But again, you know, we're always assessing and seeing what we could do to kind of build it because it is that trade off of audience, like obviously we're not going to get as many people watching on a subscriber based than we would if it was free with spots, but, you know, do you want to cut down on the paid subscribers and boost it up and then how far do I, I go with advertisers where somebody can call them and fuck me over now and do I truly have free speech now or just free as I can be a what? A subscriber base. So, uh, it's a balancing act. I see what you're saying.

Speaker 1:          02:29:18       Look, you don't want to totally abandoned the subscriber model because then you're at the mercy of subscribe, have a advert of advertisers and it gets like we have advertisers now we have a couple of them, uh, that we pop maybe two spots on a show and I do. They're all live reads. So I, I make them fun and funny and people like, I learned that from howard years ago when howard, we'd go to spots before he was syndicated to when he had all the time in the world, sometimes you didn't even know he was still in a commercial break. It was just funny. So I try to keep it light and fun and add in things. Uh, so it doesn't feel so intrusive, but I don't live in thai by sponsors. It's not, it's kind of supplements the subscribers stuff. So, uh, that works. And I don't know, maybe I'm paranoid because of my past that, uh, that sponsors might get pissed at what I'm saying.

Speaker 1:          02:30:13       But when I look at the shows, especially the shows I've been doing in the past year or so, they're not as harsh as they were. I was really fucking angry. Uh, like five years ago when I started this whole thing. I can't believe it's almost five years already, uh, that I've been doing this a compound media. And uh, I was just pissed and the show was a platform of like venting and, and revenge. And like, I just, I wanted to fucking yell and be pissed about things and bang the desk about politics and society and, and uh, it, it came off as very angry. Uh, and then as, as time went on, I realized like people would tell him he got dude just be funny, like just joke about shit and you don't have to be serious. Like I thought for some reason I had to do almost like a political show, um, because of the fact that you had gone through so much shit.

Speaker 1:          02:31:09       Yeah, I was resentful. I was pissed. And, and you know, it's a, it's one of those things that really carried over onto the show, but the past couple of years, I guess it's been, especially with bringing artie lange on board for the eight months he was with me, uh, it's very difficult to get into any kind of a commentary on society with hardy lank sitting there. It was odd. It was great. I mean, you know, the, the preface, everyone gives us fucking love already. He's hilariously funny. Uh, so quick and just a goofy knock around regular guy a, but the demon span, the demons. It was, it was kind of rough to deal with. Like I said, I'm a relaxed guy if already didn't show up one day I do the show myself. Didn't need, do the show with opi for awhile. No, he was a guest on the show and, and I guess be approached him to be a cohost or something to eat.

Speaker 1:          02:32:06       He said no. Um, but yeah, it was never part of the show. I thought he was going to be part of the show. Yeah, there was kind of a rumor going around for awhile. Uh, so when he came on I was like, it's not going to kill me if he doesn't show up for a day every so often because I'll just do the show myself. Uh, but it turned out to be a little more than that. And there was some days that were really good and other days where it was a little frayed around the edges and uh, you know, redundant. He's got different kinds of demons. Boza bub, he's got like the main demon. He really does, man, and it's so fucking sad to say because, I mean, there's no question about the talent. There he is. He's hilarious and a great guy. Great guy. You'll always hear that. You always hear that.

Speaker 1:          02:32:52       I, I remember when we hired them, it was a, I was at the comedy cellar and dave attell, can you let go? So you're working with rd. I'm like, yeah. He goes, well, welcome to the wonderful world of the 3:00 AM phone calls and not being able to find him like, oh fuck, what did we get ourselves into? And, and that's kinda what we've got ourselves into. But again, I mean, I had a great time. His, he's one of the funniest motherfuckers, especially on a mic like that. Who would think that when jackie marlin left the stern show, they'd be able to replace them with somebody that was just funny as fuck. Have legendary shows with, with a rod on. And um, you know, he, he definitely earned a place in, in broadcast history, but we just, you know, after eight months it got a little too crazy to unpredictable and you need some predictability.

Speaker 1:          02:33:46       What was, what was bad about it? Well, it was the attendance issue was a little odd. I'm like a principal. Yeah, yeah. The attendance. He wasn't, he was tardy. Uh, and, and there were some days he was fucking, just, most days it was awesome, but there were some days where, you know, the heads down, it was kind of kind of a little iffy and you know, regardless, I know he knows that too. I mean he's, he's, he lives in that body, so, you know, he knows it. So it was a little odd. Um, and then we picked up dave landau, who's a young comic out of detroit. He filled in a couple of times when we had them as guests on the show. And then he filled in a couple of times during a few sabbaticals that he was away for a week or so. And me and dave just hit it off. He's got a great sense of humor.

Speaker 1:          02:34:37       He's a little twisted. He's got a great backstory. The guy was just a fucking piece of shit for a long time. His stories about like, drunk driving crashed. Every car he had, he was arrested 15 times before he was 18, like just a disaster. And you look at him now. He's got a great wife, a beautiful kid. He's a working comic and he's awesome. He did. He knows how to cohost my show. He, he gets it. He, uh, we don't step on each other. He knows exactly what to throw in and when, so a really happy with the, with the tape. Landau. He only did one show with them the last time I was in town with. Yeah, he's great. He's a good guy, man. Dude. Yes. Smart and really decent. Like it's so weird to see people that you didn't know when they were such fuck ups and fucked up because like, you know, you almost want to go.

Speaker 1:          02:35:34       All right, come on, we'll just drink one night. I want to see what a disaster you are, you know, uh, because, you know, you just don't know how fucked up people can get a, but you'd never know. He's, he's a, he's a decent guy. I like what you're doing, man. I love it. I love that. Cool. You're doing something different in you, you basically, you got put into a corner and said, all right, I'm going to figure my way out of this. It was a lifeboat at first, but it was really expanded it now and it's, it's become a really interesting thing. Yeah. And, and I never expected it. I gave it a lot of thought in between being fired and when we finally fired it up a compound media, I was like, what do I do too? Why do I go fucking buy a ranch somewhere in the middle of the sticks and get guns and write a manifesto or something or, you know, I didn't know what to do.

Speaker 1:          02:36:28       Uh, no one was knocking on my door to fucking get me a job. So, uh, when, when the idea came to do this, it was pretty much all right, I want to do this. And regardless of how many subs I guy get, the overhead is going to be barely anything. It's me and my basement doing a broadcast. So, uh, I wasn't really worried about the number of subscribers or anything like that. And when we launched and it was really successful, uh, during the course of that year, we started getting other shows, legion of skanks, uh, the guys out there. I'm big jay oakerson and uh, steve smith and uh, no, no, they have their own thing. Louis j gomez. Yeah. They got their own thing, um, on, on their own network. Uh, but for a while they were doing their show from my house, which was so weird.

Speaker 1:          02:37:14       It was like, because you need their legion of skanks with them. They have their, part of their show is that live audience. So I'd have people coming into my backyard that I didn't know from a hole in the wall that had driven out to roslyn long island to sit on folding chairs in front of the guys. And I'm walking around my basement, like, who are these? Like, this is a little weird. It's a little intrusive, but it's cool. But it. And then it really started getting fucked up because during the summer months, uh, they all jumped in the pool. So now they're swimming in my pool. Legion of skanks was in my pool and it was the weirdest, it was cold and we'd all just, you know, have a few beers talk, you get to know people. So it wasn't that bad. No one ever did anything bad.

Speaker 1:          02:37:56       They respected the house and everything, which was very cool. Um, and then gavin was doing the show. We got gavin on board from my house and a lot of times it was at night, so I'd be upstairs on my couch watching tv or something. He'd finish up, come upstairs and sit on the couch and be like, hey man, what's that? And I'm just like, I just don't want to talk. I talked all day, I'm just, I want to watch tv. So it became a little weird and after a year, uh, keith was like, let's get a place in the city. It's easier for guests. So we've got a place at a 35th and seventh right near penn station, which works great. You know, I take the train and now I don't have to fucking drive into the city a, although that's another nightmare, the transit long island railroad.

Speaker 1:          02:38:37       But, uh, it, it just works out better that way. It gets me out of the house. It's a separation of personal life and, and, uh, the, the job. So it works out. I liked my podcasts in my house too. I think everybody does a little kids to hear him in the background screaming at each other. Mommy, she took my thing, you know, because they were really little at the time because doing it for nine years, the holy fuck. Yeah. Oh my god, no time. Yeah. So I did it in my house and then we started doing some of them, the ice house and then I got a, got a place, got a, uh, the last one. Yeah. Yes. You went to remember that. And then as the show got bigger, I just said, let's get a big place. Let's. This is insane joe. I like, I don't know how much you've shown the people on your show.

Speaker 1:          02:39:20       Do you venture out and show him anything? Because it's, it's insane. It's a fucking airplane hangar. This is giant and everything in every corner is cool. Like it's all just cool. There's for a, you got weights and mats and then that, that hunting thing, that archery game. A game. No hunt. It's amazing. It's, you know, it is a game. The scores like you compete against each other. Yeah. You're firing real arrows with your compound. Bow into what does that kevlar kevlar screen. The, the tips are flat like the top of a water bottle. So slaps it. It doesn't penetrate. Yeah. I went to a gun range a couple of times on long island that also used a video on a screen that was made with a giant rolls of paper, one horizontal, one vertical and a, a sensor would read the light that would come through when a bullet hit and uh, that would record where you shot and accurately show that.

Speaker 1:          02:40:23       And then after too many holes got in, all you have to do is wind the paper a little bit on each one and it, it misaligns the holes. So now you got a whole new sheet of paper to shoot at. Oh wow. Uh, yeah. And, and it was, it was very cold to be able to shoot it. Video targets of, you know, the bad guy. Well, it sounds like really good for real life situations for hunting. That thing's amazing. Yeah. You, you, you're not just looking at a bullseye, like a typical target face. You're looking at the crease behind the shoulder where you're trying to hit the heart. By the way, you nailed that one. I like the second one. You did. It was a deer. Just a video of a deer standing there and it's moving. It's not a still picture. And you drew that back and hit it exactly in the crease behind the leg.

Speaker 1:          02:41:08       That was a hard shot. Really cool. This fucking game is very addictive though. You'll be out there pulling that boback you fuck your shoulder up, pulling back 70 pounds all day long. Gets super addictive. Like think about how addictive it is to play video games. Oh yeah. Think about competing against another bow hunter and you talking shit to each other. Playing this game with deer walking out in the field. It's really great practice for actual bowhunting. Yeah. You could tell it's very accurate to wherever that, uh, wherever the bolt hit, it's fucking right. Right on the money. Very, very cool though. This place is awesome. An amazing. I can't even you, you were, you know, you took the ball and fucking ran with it, man. You really did. This is amazing. Just an amazing accomplishment. Like you're not your, the guy like, like people are like, oh, you're gone on rogan's podcast.

Speaker 1:          02:41:58       Oh shit. He's the guy at you. You're like ended up being the guy because of you guys. That's great. Awesome man. Because of being a guest on o and a and then watch crazy compound. That's absolutely where it all started. Crazy. I just want it. When I was doing that I, I, it was trial and error. I would go to b and h photo in manhattan and just buy shit and take it home, hook it up and go, ah, that don't quite work. Throw something in the closet, get something else. And slowly built up what I needed to have at work. My goal was really to have lower thirds and video over my shoulder and look into the camera with a teleprompter so it looked like the news, but it was done by a drunk guy who is good to go off and just sing karaoke. Horrible language. Like that to me was always funny, like it was a parody of a real tv show. I want it to look good. Not just a grainy camera with xbox headset. Just talking about this at the comedy store. The other night we were watching the news, it was on the television and we're saying how much better would the news being if you get a couple of us and get fucked up and start smoking weed and they just. But the real news, like actual real stores like oh

Speaker 3:          02:43:12       shit, look what the fuck that guy just did. And then of the news is just with comics like I've, I've, I've actually af after doing that at the comedy store and watching them and talking to a couple of friends have actually thought about doing that. Like having a nightly news show or a morning news show or just a show where one hour of the day is just like, you get the ap feed, the news feed and you've got video to go with it and you do a stoned out or drunk new show. Yeah, we,

Speaker 1:          02:43:43       we have a guy michael malice that does kind of a daily wrap up show at 11:00 PM and it's hilarious because he'll put like the other day was talking about tucker carlson and the graphic comes up and it says a tucker calls it, but it's a picture of um, who the fuck was it a sean hannity? It was a picture of sean hannity and he does shit like that all the time. And people like, dude, that's not tuck his wife. No, I thought it was, but he does that on purpose. Like he fucks with the graphics and the ticker at the bottom and everything. And it's really weird. It's really funny. He's a, he's a smart guy too. He's a clever, a little shit. Uh, yeah. So, but that's shit like, that is great. We did it. We did an election show during the presidential election a couple of years ago.

Speaker 1:          02:44:31       Then gavin was on that one and we had all the big american flag waving in the background on the green screen and everything, and, and we were calling it like a sporting event. Depalo was there, uh, and it really turned into like a football game. You're just going, oh my god, we just got Florida. Oh my god. It was so. And it was. We were all drinking and lab and it was an election coverage like the news would do, but we were just hammered and laughing our balls off. Know what do you think happens to gavin now? A well, no one bounces back from this. That kind of shit. It's so tough.

Speaker 3:          02:45:03       It's a different kind of shit that he's in right now. Cult leader, like he's in this, they've, they've got david koresh as mouse has. He's got the eye of sauron on him. Just once that's on you. It's very hard to shake that fucking thing off of you.

Speaker 1:          02:45:21       Yeah, if anyone can do it. It's gavin. He's been really reborn a couple of times. He was supposed to be trans thing. Not really. Ah, they gave him a lot of shit for that and he got plus this company.

Speaker 3:          02:45:36       Yeah. But that's like professional stuff that's not like show biz stuff now he's in this weird show. Biz exile. A

Speaker 1:          02:45:44       place. Yeah. Willie's on crtv. Yeah. That's still real. He does a show there. Yeah. Fuck watches that. I don't know. You know, I, I, I see clips of him. But um, yeah, it's raised that. What is crtv? It's another kind of an internet thing. Yeah. But more straight news kind of based a why would they have him on it? Uh, he was on there. He got hired by them maybe a year or so ago,

Speaker 2:          02:46:10       but if they're trying to do something straight, he's not like you at least kind of the goofy. I think the goofy. Yeah. Aspect of it. And then they'll have, you know, the regular straight laced guy. Why don't you have them on compound anymore? Uh, he got a better offer to go over there, you know, and I can hold anybody back here. Why you don't chew. It is weird though, because you can be stricken from the record as they showed with Alex Jones. They just, holy fuck. Did they just get rid of him? He is a nonperson. They fucking took every aspect of his uh, uh, feed off of every bit of social media and it's obviously a coordinated effort. Yeah. Yeah. This is not just one company that also competes with another company that all of a sudden they all just universally decided on their own independently. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          02:46:59       No, they, they coordinated that I can't stand the uh, you know, I am an absolutist with free speech. I and, and I know the fucking line. It's a private company can do what they want. Freedom of speech is about the government in this. It's like, yeah, but are you okay with that? Are you okay with a faceless corporation? Uh, deciding what you can watch and see and hear and who can speak based on nothing but this arbitrary ideology that comes out of a building. Like, I don't like that. I want anyone to have the ability to speak about anything they want, no matter how repugnant it is. Like like meet it with a lively debate. Well, here's the. Here's a perfect example. Forget Alex Jones was talking about what we talked about earlier. Laura loomer versus louis farrakhan. You where's your consistency? You've got to explain to me how that works.

Speaker 2:          02:47:50       How does that was, is it okay for the guy on twitter to be calling jewish people? Termites? I mean that. That is. That's something you exterminate. Yeah. Yes. It's nazi Germany type. Yeah, exactly. How is that? Okay. That's okay with you, but then, I mean, how about look, it works that way on the left as well. Like how about that guy that just got kicked off of cnn as he was talking about the jewish people, Israel, palestine and that he's for palestinian liberation and they were like, fuck you, you're done like this. This decision that or the thought processes involved in decisions that they make is not based on rational thinking and objective reasoning. It's so arbitrary. You just don't know. It's based on which way the culture swinging and the culture is swinging in a way that avoids any, any possible accusations of racism. If you think in any way, shape or form, you're going to be thought of as racist. You avoid that because there's some people that say horrific shit about white people. Oh yeah. Yeah. They don't get van literally calling for their death and, and yeah, they don't. The, that got hired by New York times and it was a massive uproar because she had so many anti white things on her twitter. Oh yeah, yeah. The uh, the asian girl. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, just all that ridiculous

Speaker 3:          02:49:08       leftwing woke nonsense. You're allowed to be completely racist against white people. Massive generalizations against white men in particular. Like, yeah, yeah, it is. It absolutely is discrimination. And it's absolutely what you're doing is you're being prejudiced, but you're being prejudice with a stamp. You've got a stamp of approval. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:49:29       Yeah. You're allowed to be. And I love the, the rules that are made up that are ridiculous. It's like, oh, you're a racist. I can't be a racist. I'm this or that or that. I can't be sexist. I can't be this. Like who's making these fucking rules up? Exactly. How come I am not privy to any of them? Of course I can. I can call on any of these.

Speaker 3:          02:49:49       Did. The beautiful thing about that is that hypocrisy will eventually bite them in their ass and people who are rational, who listened to the argument against it, and so will you absolutely can be sexist against men. Yeah, absolutely. Ken, of course, and you are a lot of feminists are 100 percent sexist against men. There's this feminist that I follow her fucking twitter picture, the image, the big one. The banner one says, trust. No man. Okay, well good. Fucking luck. Good luck cutting out half the population. Don't trust them. How about trust? All women? You're going to do that. Well, great. Congratulations. Because you got about 15 to 20 percent and that's. You're going to have to trust all of them. Yeah. Yeah. Good luck. You got 80, 80, 85, 90 percent maybe. Good gals got polluted. Polluted population. Just like men. Population of men is a polluted population of women. If you, if you thought that you were going to get pure drinking water without dropping in those, uh, purification tablets, you're going to get some shit in there. Yeah, you're going to get, you're going to get sick. The, yeah, that there's no,

Speaker 1:          02:50:54       there's no 100 percent on any of that. So when we saw the whole believe all women thing that happened during the cabinet hearings,

Speaker 3:          02:51:02       I didn't do that bit the other night. I did a now tell it to you off air. I'll tell you something off here. That's

Speaker 1:          02:51:09       it. It's, it's, it's crazy. Like the idea that anyone would say, believe all women is as mentally saying, believed no women. Exactly. It's the same stupid thing because there's going to be assholes is going to be pieces of shit. Um, I was saying on the show the other day, like no one really wants equality. No one. Equality isn't good. The, the fight for equality is where it's at and you never want to attain it because then you're not special anymore. If you're fighting for equality that you're always a victim. There's always a, an oppressor and you're fighting that once you're equal, you can be called a shithead. You could be called stupid everything else. You're just another face in the crowd with another stupid voice that probably shouldn't be heard. Uh, so no one ever really wants equality. No matter how much they're clamoring was get achieved. You're going to find some reason why it's not right. Why it's not valid. And you can still say that you're

Speaker 2:          02:52:06       being victimized by something that currency in it. Yeah. Yeah. There is. There's, there's definitely equity and being a victim and not being equal yet, but you're fighting. You can say things that other people can say. We see it all ties. You can be completely prejudice. You can do a lot of things. You could never do if you were another race. Yeah. And now you see this, uh, that avi naughty guy, that lawyer just hilarious. He had the whole believe all women and then like a fucking movie script spins around and bites him right in the ass where he's like, I didn't do that. She's lying. It's like the fact that it happened so fast. Like if that would have been hilarious if it happened two years from now, but the fact that it happened right after that is just beyond hilarious. Like the asia argento chick, right?

Speaker 2:          02:52:58       Yeah. The other one, the one who was accusing harvey weinstein of raping her. Right. And then turned out that she had been. It's basically what, what do they call it? Statutory rape when you have sex with 17 year old boy, which. Yeah, I don't think it is. I don't think you think it is either, but the law's the law and the fact that it came out, it came out that bordain had paid this kid off there the whole time. They're all just believe all women and like who don't believe that one. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. That one we probably shouldn't believe. I mean this is, this is a problem. You got a real fucking problem. And the fact that all that went down, you know, I mean it's just when these things play out like this, it almost makes you wonder like, god, I don't, I don't really believe we're living in a simulation.

Speaker 2:          02:53:44       But if we were living in something that's designed to almost, it instills this lack of appreciation for reality, it seems. It all seems so bizarre and ludicrous and it keeps people keep like when, when the anthony wiener got in trouble for pulling his dick out, I swear to god there was part of me that was going. This doesn't even make sense. Like this is so, so obvious. It's so like right there. Yeah. Yeah. So on the button. Yeah. Not even subtle enough. A lot of that stuff. It seems like everything works out too much. Like it's scripted. Like during, during trump's campaign, I kept saying he's got a. When I go, this doesn't play. If he doesn't win, this isn't rocky one. This has to be rocky too. He's got a fucking win. It's not about the battle and the bravery and that he's got to win this for this to work.

Speaker 2:          02:54:42       To really highlight the theater of the absurd. Right? He's got to win. Yes. This is all fucking one spotlights in the air. I see the theater of the absurd. I mean that guy being president with his fake hair sprayed down and orange skin with the wider on the eyes. It all seems so fake. Everything he says, he says the way he looks like. Yeah, everything is insane. I still, every time I see him walking down the stairs at air force one, I'm just like, holy fuck. Donald trump is the president. Like what? What kind of wacky world of really wacky world, ideally wacky. The other day when he was given that speech about elvis and it's just like people telling me, I looked like elvis. That's what people have told me. If I wasn't blonde, I looked like elvis and and it's like no, no one told you that a little bit like elvis. No one ever told you that. Maybe your belly right when elvis was sitting on the ball for the last time, but that's about it. How about when that reporter confronted him with the two of them together?

Speaker 2:          02:55:51       Well, when I look at that picture, if he was to me, a leg leg, the king maybe. Oh my god. A little bit about the upper right hand corner one. Have you. Have you ever seen anyone do that? Fat was my favorite. Fat elvis. Too much baby. Of course. A thousand times now. Have you ever seen someone so committed to a comb over for so many years? Like so committed. It's not just a coma. I don't know what it is. It's a contraption walking up the stairs of air force one where the wind's blowing wind behind. You see the whole back of his head is bald. Like where's the hair coming from? It was like a fucking vader's head without the helmet is kind of looked like that weird. Like what's going on? You never know where it's starting and where it ends at, how long it is.

Speaker 2:          02:56:46       It's like, look at that. Oh my god. That's just a picture. The video is more disturbing because you see the flops. Yeah. Yeah. Chaos. Well, how about, you know, he didn't want to go out there for the 4th of July memorial because he didn't want to get his hair with his hair wet in the rain. That was a. Yeah, that's what they were saying. I don't know that it's such a weird thing. Like he was September 11th. That's what it was. The president of nine slash 11 was a veteran's memorial or veteran's day. Isn't it odd that the president is a guy that's so like insecure than ever for decades. He has to fucking do a, a fucking dairy queen ice cream. Fucking move on his head every day. So he's fat. Like if your. The thing is like if you really concerned so much about your looks or why are you fat while you're at it? I don't think he thinks he's fat. I think it's like one of those guys that you talked about having a body dysmorphia body dysmorphia. They just, he looks in the mirror and sees elvis, like young leather clad elvis. Yeah. He's got this weird thing. You know, where he doesn't believe in exercise because he feels like the body is like a battery and if you put any energy and

Speaker 3:          02:58:02       where is it out? Well, the motherfucker is up at all hours. The, uh, during the campaign for the midterms, he was doing three rallies a day flying all over the country and he never seemed to be like he was falling asleep or losing energy. So I don't know what he's doing. Well, you know about all that he says I get exercise. I mean, I walk, I this, I that trump's nobody wants that. During the oval office. I run over to a building next door. I get more exercise than people think. I run over to a field basing my exercise is incredible. He's on allegedly, according to one reporter, he's on diet pills and that he's been on diet pills forever. And then there's a prescription that, I mean, he, he actually even cited the exact dwayne reed pharmacy where he was supposed to take this for a little while and he wound up taking it for years.

Speaker 3:          02:58:52       I was taking some form of amphetamines, which in this day and age, if you would be fucking stunned if you found out how many journalists, how many people who are writers, how many people that are professionals, how many people that work were on adderall that I'm in. I mean, I live in an area where there's a lot of people that have money and they work real hard and because of the fact that they need energy, I know a shitload of people that are taken adderall. Yeah. Folks that are in hollywood, folks that are in finance, all sorts of different. Yeah, I know quite a few also. Yeah, they, it's everywhere, man. And it is such a, you know, the difference between methamphetamines and amphetamines. The difference between math and what you're getting when you get adderall is so god damn close. So close. But math, it's crazy that you take that you're fucking, you're a meth head.

Speaker 3:          02:59:45       The only difference is how quick it hits you. It's literally the only difference. And then the dosage that you get is obviously regulated if you get adderall. Right, right. I don't know. I, uh, I'm not, I'm not a pill guy. I never have been. What do you got here, jamie? We pull it up. It says here about being on a treadmill. Awesome. I was on a treadmill for the first time actually in quite a while and it was a very steep angle and I was there for a very long time. He said they were surprised and they said, well, you could stop now. That's amazing. I said, I can go much longer than this if you want me to hate trump. I got to fucking right now, buddy. I got a challenge. How about you joined the sober october fitness challenge next year, man, hop on. We'll put that strap on. You will see what's up. See what I'm saying? Who's amazed? A lot of mickey mantle gene. Everything is over the top with trump. Trump d dieted successfully before had been more of a believer in diet because I'm strong, you know, I've always been more of a believer in diet cause I'm strong. You know, I hit the ball far. I mean I'm strong physically. He said, that is so hilarious. Will you imagined wrestling him how? Wiki? Westfield. Just a bag of jello. Just wrap up body and

Speaker 2:          03:01:00       it's all gushy. The bones are barely held together by a thread and I can. What are you talking about? Your ball far strung. I mean when he said that he would beat up joe barden. That was my. That was like a peak ludicrousness yeah. Yeah. Was like, what you're going to beat up to joe biden would go down fast and hard. That's what he said. Do it. The fact that they're talking like that again. Absurd. It's so fucking funny that bull and biden has said the same thing. Like he kick his ass. He's a blake. When did the truman and dewey trade barbs like that? Back in the day is. What is he saying? Nixon and kennedy. I did make a mistake, but they asked me what I like to debate this gentleman. I said, no. I said, if we're in high school, I've taken behind the gym and beat the hell out of them mean well, I don't believe that.

Speaker 2:          03:01:54       I think trump would kick his ass. I really do. Trump is meaner and I think biden would make a mistake, yet trump better be able to. He would swing any would slip and he would fall and he'd fuck is nea and trump would kick him in the face like a soccer ball. He would get lucky, he would walk away and biden would be holding this teeth and blood coming out of his mouth and he'd be like, I told you in the best, the best ever. And he'd get away with it. It gets away with a lot of things and there'll be a lot of people want to kick trump's ass and get back at them, but it would never manifested, so would never come to play. Just like what's going on now. It's like where people thought stormy daniels going to take them down. And then it turns out stormy daniels beat some checkup on a porn set.

Speaker 2:          03:02:32       And, and now she's after menotti also because he, uh, apparently isn't giving her an accounting of where all the money that she raised a online was going to. And he apparently filed. She said he filed that lawsuit against trump against her wishes. She didn't want it done and now she, she's not getting an accounting of the money. It's hilarious. Defamation that she lost and now she has to pay his legal, his legal fees. So this novel, naughty guy's hilarious. He wants to run for president. Just another dummy in the mix. Another dummy. Listen to these. He's another guy chain himself to a building. It's the same thing. It's the same bull horn, right? He just wants attention. I had actually talked to guys in hollywood. It works in hollywood. He's like a high level guy. He's got a respectable job and he's like, we need a guideline like that.

Speaker 2:          03:03:21       Have an audi guy on our side. It doesn't talk any shit. Why doesn't take any shit? A guy who could call trump out on his bullshit and I'm like, what are you talking about man? Like what are you talking about? This guy, this lawyer, this guy's the guy you think you need running the country. Are you serious? It's a disaster. They wanted to believe that he was the guy, right? It fit the narrative like, yes, we need a guy like that. We need a good guy like trump. You know keith olbermann is. This is what all these people are a good guy. Who's gonna kill him. You fat. Fuck you fucking liar. You pizza shit with trump. Trump has nothing to lose is what it is. Like trump could say anything and he does because where they're going to do well, they're going to do.

Speaker 2:          03:04:03       He's one of the things about diet pills. They're, they're putting about amphetamines and they were reading down in this article, all of the side effects of the bonds of grand juror, elevated sense of your place in the world. Like all the is the president and on top elevated sense of the president. Wow. That is great. I'm the president of the world. I think he thinks he is, but he is. He's. He's fucking. But it'd be visa president, United States. You're basically a pretty much president of the world. Yeah. Yeah. At least if there's a number one through 10, your number one. Yeah. Yeah. Alright. Who's next? Who's number two? That is. That's number two. Is donald fucking trump all day. One of my favorite hillary quilts is really recently. She was, she said I would like to be president. That's what she said. Oh yeah, yeah. I'd like to be president.

Speaker 2:          03:04:55       You should never be president then because that's not what the job is. That job's not some shit you put on your resume. Right? Right. To be president. Like a cookie. Yeah. Yeah. That's what it comes off as, like to be the queen. I was like that. I would like, if you kiss my ass, I would suck my toes. What would you would like it trump. That's why trump comes off as like a, just a bad stand up when he does those rallies and everything. Like you can tell when he's squinting at the prompter. And he was like, we as americans must blah blah blah blah. And then you see his eyes open and he's like, so let me tell you if he's all prompter. And that's when I go, oh, here it comes. Here comes a winner. And when he, when he talks about ice and he's like the men and women of ice, just amazing people.

Speaker 2:          03:05:42       A job that none of us want to do. We don't want to do. And then he starts the crowd. Work this guy over here, look at him. He didn't want to do it. His wife knows what he's doing. Crowd work like fuck. It's the president. It's so fucking bizarre. Do you remember that one? Ninety minute speech that he gave this rambling nonsense that people go, this is the day the presidency unraveled. It was two years ago. That shit was forever ago. And he's still unraveling. It's, it's, uh, he's not even unraveling. It's just who he is. Do we go back to the, you know, this guy as a whole and what we knew to do because guaranteed in 2020, that's going to be the pitch against trump. We need to return to some semblance of society. It's going to be a young democratic socialist type character that says a lot of things that the young people want to hear.

Speaker 2:          03:06:33       And then it's like a completely anti racist, anti homophobic trans rights, all that stuff. That's what I think. Someone who can hold it together and someone doesn't have a good fucking box above in the closet. That's getting tougher and tougher to find these days. Man, there is some shit just fucking graveyards falling out of people's closets. It's people that want to be in power that all have these fucking skeletons. What's the weird things? Is these people that want to be in power? Yeah, I think it's hilarious. Like you look at the. I'm a politician like you just described at a rally or a speech and behind them is just, it's so well choreographed, like every nationality is represented and you know, you just see it looks like something out of a fucking star trek episode that hats from different lands and all kinds of things and it's like that to me is just as fake and and potentially offensive as just the trump background.

Speaker 2:          03:07:35       White trash is like laura dern running star trek or star wars. Just what it's like bring it back. Yes. It's like, oh, okay. I see what you're doing. Now that laura dern is a bad actress. She's a great actress. But in that role and in this situation and when she's like telling the pilot to shut up and listen, stop guys. A fucking straight up killer is out there flying as a pilot. Piloting a spaceship, getting down evil robots and want to blow up the planet. He's really going to be intimidated by laura dern. I remember when we first started running this empathic, shut the fuck up. She's forced fed. Just force fed. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          03:08:16       These, these really obvious. There's this theatrical plays at diversity and inclusiveness, aggressiveness and you could tell that they, like they've pushed every, there's no authenticity to their, their message. They have to push every correct button and say all the right notes and make all the right sounds. It's. Yeah. Yeah. It's like this thing, they're, they're, they're complying. It's a compliance thing as much as it is an expression of who they are as individuals and have to be compliant with this new, this new way. People are thinking and behaving but, but it's so ham handed, like, like it's really over the top. It's obvious. It's like a guy named wiener pulling his dick out. It's not too obvious. It's too clunky, too. Right on the head. You know what I heard that some of the movies that are coming out, um, I think they're doing a girl version of bad boys.

Speaker 2:          03:09:10       Oh, which is like, why the fuck they doing ghostbusters, like ghost busters, which was such a success. Uh, and then I saw this. Isn't my logo kicked off a twitter? Yeah. Yeah, like goofing on. Uh, what's her name there? I'm leslie. Leslie jones. Yeah. Yeah. So I, I read this the other day, uh, there's a broadway show of king kong is now a broadway musical and they have this amazing kind of marionette gorilla on the stage giant fucking thing. And the girl that plays a, an darrow, uh, and, and now a new girl has been cast. She's black now. I'm like this, the whole gist

Speaker 1:          03:09:54       of king kong is the fact that it's a white broad, like the whole island is full of black chicks. Whoa. This, this marionette king kong picks her up. What's up with his face? I don't know. They had to make them, you know, almost uh, you know, the characters look in the lion king musical. Something weird. Yeah. Yeah. So is that, that's all I'm marrying it yet. It's like a fucking, it's on cables and, and shit and just people working it. And how strange it. If you, if there's a video clip of it and you see it kind of move, it's a. It is strange. We got to see a video, but like I said, the whole fucking thing is based on. It's the white chick. Yeah, like, like it, it's part of the story. I can understand. You can cast a black actress and a white actress as part as that, but when it's so integral to the story that this fucking got. Yeah, that's sick. That's amazing. Yeah. Yeah. It looks pretty fucking bad ass. But where's this for? What's this guy get out of their buddy? Wow. This is amazing. Yeah. Isn't that second a fucking a broadway stage? They got all this that's going on. It really is. That really is amazing. They got the teeth lit up and everything. Yeah. The lighting is pretty important and pretty

Speaker 3:          03:11:07       bad ass. So this was the old one. The old one used to be a blonde chick.

Speaker 1:          03:11:09       Yeah. Yeah. No, not anymore in our hands. We're going to get a black trans man. I mean, the whole gimmick is that kang has been on this island with black chicks and he sees her and just loses his fucking mind. Yeah. I have a whole bit of bike hurt it the other night. It's the fucking brilliant. It's so goddamn funny. But it is true. It's like that movie is like the most racist movie of all time. All right. So when, when the remake came out, I think it was Peter Jackson remake came out, um, patrice went off on it and did a whole thing about what the movie represents and what the chicken and the gorilla represents an hour and it was fucking brilliant. Only as patrice could have done it. Uh, and he, you know, he nailed it. Do you know the movie frozen? The little kids moving. I never saw it. Girl who

Speaker 3:          03:12:03       can fucking turning things into ice. There's a disney version of live does diversion that they've decided to do. And in the live disney version there, the girl is now played by a black girl, but it's, it's a blonde girl who lives in like Norway. It doesn't make sense. They've decided to have her be played by a black girl and people went crazy. They send all these emails in like, this is outrageous, like what are you do? And it's like, yeah, but I feel like these companies, they, it's, there's too many people involved. Right. It's not like compound media. It's just the anthony kumi and making decisions. Right. With something like disney, you have this board and you probably in California, you have to have a certain amount of women on the board. Right? Imagine what that must be like. You have to have equal

Speaker 2:          03:12:52       representation of everyone. Everyone's super concerned about diversity, like at a fundraising pitch to show. And when they walked in there, the first question they said he pitched the show. They go, okay, where's the diversity? Where's the diversity? Like he was pitching a sitcom. Where's the diversity? It's like, I'm just pitching you something funny. A pitch. You a funny program. Yeah, yeah. Okay. We need a, we need an asian man, black woman. We needed this and that. And again, like we were talking about it, it's so obvious that it becomes distracting. Like I don't want. I don't want to have to watch something that, that diversity is just forced in there. Right, because you, you notice it and now you're distracted and you can't really enjoy the things like that king kong thing, like how do you, how do they do the part where the, the, the natives on skull island, a kong is just like ah, get outta here, but this one is like, oh, this, there has to be something different and it's definitely the hair color and skin guy.

Speaker 2:          03:13:53       It's just what it was. It's regardless of how horrible it is or, or whatever past. That's just the way it is. Roll up. Right and move on. I. Yeah. Time has passed you by old man. Old white dude. Yeah. Oh, old white dude doesn't like when a black woman gets her role for all black women, all white women. There are so many instances where that's fine and no one would notice and whatever. I don't even, I don't have a problem with hamilton or whatever. They want to cast founding fathers as black and hispanic dudes whatevs go at it. But like when it's an integral part of the story, it's most of the stories. It's most of the reason why loses his mind. He falls in love with the white chick a whole time. He's. He's on camera in the movie. He's. They're losing his mind because of the white chick that, yeah, just don't make a movie then just don't, don't make the movie or don't make the play the.

Speaker 2:          03:14:52       I didn't get to make the playbook. We're going to have a black woman of color. I'm going to have a young woman of color. That's my favorite criticisms is how dare to white people have this discussion without a person of color. Well, that's true. Yeah. Yeah. We'll probably catch shit for this, but it's from who? From who? That can go fuck themselves. Who would you propose this idea? The idea that. Wait, hold on. Anthony. Before we go any further, let's bring it a person of color. Yeah. Yeah. A person of color. How should we. We are. We were too privileged people. We shouldn't be discussing. That is true. But you can't even communicate about something. No, no you can't. And all we hear about is how we need an open and honest discussion about race. And then the second year try to half one, shut up. Don't talk about. Here's one that everybody keeps ignoring. You want to know what's racist? Harvard tries really hard to keep asian people out. Yeah. Yeah. Make you get way more difficult because asian people are far better at school than white people.

Speaker 1:          03:15:50       Just the way it is. And they have to balance it. It would be full of asians if everybody was, uh, got accepted for qualifications, that would be asian, harvard. But it is amazing. The people that are rallying against racial discrimination don't look at that because that is absolute racial discrimination. But on the other end of the spectrum, right, right. You're taking these people that are, they are a minority. There are a small percentage of the population and they vastly outperform most other groups. Yeah. Yeah. And because of that, harvard has made it more difficult for them to get in. And now there's a giant class action lawsuit against one of the most liberal and progressive institutes of higher learning ever racist. They're fucking undeniably racist is racist. Yeah. It's the superior people. It's absolutely based on nothing but someone's race, ethnic background and uh, they're, they're doing it.

Speaker 1:          03:16:44       Yeah. They're doing it for now, for now. But you don't hear about this from the social justice warriors and now no race baiters they want to go on about white privilege and yeah, it, it really is. Look, I, I just like bringing shit up that I notice and if I notice that they're squeezing diversity into something that doesn't need it, I, I think it looks like I said distracting and it's out of place. And then other things, like the other day I noticed, uh, and, and you probably shouldn't even say it, that the, a mars probe that just landed on mars and they showed the control room at jet propulsion laboratories and they're all applauding. Could possibly be the least diverse room I've ever seen in my life. A bunch of white nerds. That's all it was. There were a couple of like a big women, like, like a kind of, you know, lesbians, lesbians, a couple of them in there.

Speaker 1:          03:17:39       But for the most part, it was every nerdy guy grown up and landing a fucking spec, a billion miles away on fucking mars. It's insane because when it push comes to shove, you need the people that can get the job done and if it's that room of people, it's that room of people. You can't artificially diversify something just for the optic and get the job done. They had. Everyone in that room had a reason to be there and I assume it's based on qualifications, but if you notice that or mention it, I'm sure I'll be called a fucking racist for that. Yeah, for sure. Don't ever notice things you can't switch. The rule is don't notice. Trends. Don't notice things. I feel like that's going away though. You really do. I just, I don't see it lasting. I just, I feel like it's a, a bright wave of nonsense that's hitting us and it's going to balance back out and rational thinking is, can you. Here's the thing, this is one of the things that drives me crazy. It's like, you know, address your white privilege. Recognize your white privilege. No. You know why

Speaker 3:          03:18:48       I'm not racist? Okay, so if I'm not racist, you should be concentrating on racism. He shouldn't be concentrating on people who don't experience racism because there fortunately white, because I didn't do anything, didn't do anything just by being, but what they're doing is they're putting you in a position where you're always guilty and once they put you in that box, they always can shut you up because there the logic is not very good. So the discourse is not. It's not well thought out. It's not really nuanced. So because of that, they want to be able to just push a button and shut you off. That button is the white privilege button. But that's. You're looking at. You're looking at a reality. Yeah. Do white people have it easier than people who get racially discriminated against? Yes, but the problem is not the white people that have it easy. The problem is the people that racially discriminate. Yeah. Yeah. So you're looking at the wrong thing. So you're finding somebody you want to make them a bad person just by being the. The, the thing that you've decided is the oppressor. Yeah. It's a racist thing.

Speaker 1:          03:19:44       Everything is the same level, whether you have an opinion about something, just voicing an opinion about something that involves race or sexuality or whatever it is, and literally calling for violence against people of. It's all in the same category when it's ridiculous. You could have your, your personal opinion on anything that is sensitive these days, like I said, race or sexuality or what have you. It doesn't mean anything unless you use some kind of negativity or oppression or something against, uh, the person because of your opinion. Uh, until you do that, you just have a fucking opinion and it's not all that dangerous. Uh, patrice used to say that too. He goes, I never met a racist in my life because I never met one, never sat down and had someone calling the n word or anything like that. He goes to never met one. He's been in the wrong places.

Speaker 1:          03:20:39       Maybe take them to some places, but, but it's like, let's say you have somebody that has a low opinion of, of black people and, and just go into a bar. You sit down and there's a black dude sitting there and watching the yankee game or something and go, uh, uh, he goes, hey, look at that. The yankees are winning. D is the guy gotta to turn around and go, fuck you dropping bombs or is it going to go? Yeah, I guess so. Like, like there's, there's levels of, of that. He might have an idea about it, but until you start exercising that I don't honestly don't see a problem with it. This piece of discrimination eight,

Speaker 3:          03:21:17       and they have discrim discriminatory ideas about all sorts of things. It's just when you allow some but don't allow others when you allow discrimination against white people, but you don't allow it against black. Create resentment when you allow discrimination against men, but don't allow it against women because you feel like women have been victimized. So it's our time. It's our turn will know it doesn't work that way. It doesn't work that way. Especially when you're talking to people that aren't rapists. Call everybody a rapist and the people who aren't rapists, you go, oh, okay. So you think everybody's a rapist will you? Will you are fucking crazy. And then they start changing what? Rape,

Speaker 1:          03:21:53       right? Yeah. Yeah. Well that's what the, that's kind of what they've done. I mean obviously the uh, like the louis ck situation, I know that is so people are so divided on that one and my opinion is if, if he didn't do anything or make anyone do anything against their will, he's just a guy that has a strange proclivity, you know, he likes jerking off in front of people. Apparently the cat's out of the bag there, but like where those girls that upset 20 years ago with a that upset 20 years ago that, that now it's an issue or with a giggle where they let, like I need to know how they were then because I don't give a fuck what you think now. Like at the time, what was it? Okay. Was it cool with you? Oh, did you sit there and fucking rib the elbow to the ribs with you girlfriend? I go look at this guy jerking off in front of us. Uh, to me, I don't care what, what time is done because it, the, the, the, the way something looks, the morality or ethics or respect that is expected in 2018 ain't what it was 20 years ago. So you can't be held liable for something you did 20 years ago when it was normal or a little strange or whatever the fuck it was. Well, I think it's always been weird to beat off in front of people. That's an odd thing to do.

Speaker 3:          03:23:12       I think about it as though he asked if he could write, and this is something that I've brought up to people go, you know, when people say, oh, you know, he would lock these women in the room and beat off to stop the. If you're to, if you get like, push this, you're saying that because that fits your narrative. He's this abusive person who's abusing his power. Now here's another problem with that. When this was all going down, he wasn't very famous. No, that's just a tosa. What power was he abusing it? He, he was a successful comedian. He was admired by his peers because he was really funny. He wasn't louis c, k like the superstar filling out madison square garden, louis ck. It wasn't the same guy, you know, he, he didn't even have all the hbo specials and all the netflix specials was the same guy. So he was just another comic that like to beat off in front of people and he would ask first. So when you say that he, you know, forced these women and wouldn't let them leave, none of them say that. In fact he asked and when they said no, he didn't do it, he didn't say, oh, well good. You don't want me to beat off that. Make it feel even better when I beat off in front of you. Shut the fuck up and sit down. You know, he doesn't do anything.

Speaker 1:          03:24:18       No. He was asking which is, which is so strange but weird thing. It's not. It's not in the same realm as, as harvey weinstein's. It's not

Speaker 3:          03:24:28       even fucking know. It's not even close. It's not even close, but people don't want you to rationalize. Don't want you to grade things. They just want to talk about abuse. All abuse gets shoveled into this one little pie chart area like this is male abusers, and then they'll put matt lauer right next to bill cosby, right next to louis ck. Like, well, this seems kind of crazy. And then when you say it's crazy, like matt damon said, let's, I think we should make a distinction.

Speaker 1:          03:24:56       Oh yeah, you can't be, you become a rape apologist and say things like that. And uh, it's weird because it's odd because even saying the word rape these days, like a little red flag goes off in your head. Like, how did I say that? Did I say, did I say it evil? And it was a sound. Evil are salivating, right? Don't be salivating, don't smile when you say it's very somber. It, it is strange. It's this, uh, I use the term all the time because it's the only one that really fits orwellian. Everything is so strange now it, if you read 1984 years ago, you couldn't fathom things getting like that. But man, in some cases it's even worse than, than expected. You think there aren't an unperson you don't think there's an unpaid Alex Jones unperson wipe them clean from the [inaudible] that's it. Uh, the, this, uh, new speak words are twisted, like it means the opposite of what it was supposed to me.

Speaker 1:          03:26:02       And, and uh, it, it, it's something that you never thought would happen to. I always thought like, we read a book like that or some other kind of this dystopian story. You get like a, a, like an orb is supposed to be some kind of orb with the government looking at you and don't do that, sir. Twenty six, 53. Oh, to sit down and then it's like, oh fuck. It was us. Oh, where the rats, we, we pick up our phone and we rat each other out and we're big brother. Like we turned out to be the bad guy. The collective this not the government. They like, like, oh boy, you're going to. The government's got to put a tracking device on you. Fuck that. He comes to my house and wants to put out. I'll shoot them. I don't care. Oh, you forgot your phone.

Speaker 1:          03:26:50       Don't, don't leave your house without your fucking tracking device, like it's the same thing and they do use those and chronic case, everything is presented as a convenience. When I first got easy pass, it was like, this is awesome. I don't have to wait on a line at a toll booth and throw change in or something. I'm whizzing right through and then I see a story. It's like, oh, easy pass use in a divorce case to see what the husband was going here or there. And it's like, oh, that's handy. That's handy. And then you see on the insurance commercials, it's like, use the safe driver thing. It goes in your car and it acts like a, a plain black box. And, and it shows how safety driving they'll reduce your rates. It's like, really? it's not going to be used if I'm speeding again into accident for them to go, yeah, we're not paying your fucking thing because obviously we'd read that you were speeding and, uh, and, and didn't stop or like it's all presented as a convenience.

Speaker 1:          03:27:41       Alexa, you literally your tvs, they all wrap you out. It's alexa isn't this magic thing that everything happens internally. That shit sends everything you say out records it somewhere and then sends whatever answer it's supposed to give back back to it and that's what it is. But everything is saved and do you really know when it's listening and when your toe you say certain things. I had alexa for a little while. I don't know why all I ever did was like alexa, whether that will tell me the weather I could have checked on my phone and then it started doing things like I just be watching tv and it wouldn't be like I don't have an answer for that. Like, yeah, I don't need that shit. I don't know what it's doing. I don't know what it listening in dialogue from the television from maybe the tv.

Speaker 1:          03:28:27       Maybe it's just listening to every fucking thing I say and sending a transcript somewhere because then you could go to the app on your phone and every question you ever asked it is listed there in text. Fucking form. Swear to you. Every conversation you have with that goddamn thing is somewhere. Well, hey dad, what are you worried about? There you go. Well, hey, hey. Hey. as long as it keeps us safe. Right? Right. Can you say about how about yeah, if you're not doing anything bad, well in 10 years, will this be bad? In five years, just like shit that 20 years ago it wasn't bad. Now it's a fucking crime. You'll be exIled from society. I don't know if what I'm saying now can be brought up in 10 years and you know, when I play video games I say some pretty nasty shit, but uh, yeah, I don't want to alexa or, or my smart tv, listen to every fucking thing I say and record transcripts of what I'm talking about and we bring it in our house.

Speaker 1:          03:29:24       No one's forcing you to put this fucking rad. Now's you. You paid for it, you spend money and you put it there and plugged it in yourself. It's amazing how we went from not trusting anything. I remember when online shopping for a started and you're like, I'm not putting my credit card in there now you're laughing. What are you kidding? You just drove through twin 20 face scanners, license plate scanners to get here. Your, your card is being picked up by a sensor so they can target, advertise you in the mall, so there's no privacy anymore and we love it. We love that. There's no privacy. I don't want to go to the mall for christmas. I go to amazon and now there's a lIst of every fucking thing I buy at amazon that's being sent to everyone all over the place. You think you've got privacy.

Speaker 1:          03:30:14       Fuck you. You can't even move to a Montana anymore in a cabin and be off the grid, which just doesn't happen. So I love jesse. Jesse, jesse. When it does, I'm off the grid. I, I'm going to Mexico and I'm off the grid and it's like he's got a show called off the grid. It's like, well, Yeah, you're on the grid guy mma, a fighter governor. He's a. Yeah, he's off The grid, but he's constantly on the grid. There's no off the grid anymore. There's no awkward. The whole world's going to be on the grid. Yeah, the whole world. That's what they're targeting. Expand these satellite imagery things for uh, for um, the internet doing that as well. Where are going To have satellite internet available everywhere all over the world, all over the world. And everybody up to speed. And I was talking about this with somebody else.

Speaker 1:          03:31:04       Isn't it amazing that gps has worked for as long as it has? Yeah, flawlessly. It's amazing how good it was. Never a problem inch by inch like literally tells you turn right. And you're right there. And I think we have the dumbed down version, like the military has that, the premium version like sure. But yeah, by the, by the inch and we have, you know, buy a couple of feet. But it's to me it's amazing that like it's worked this long. It never goes out. like oh, it's really had it on cd rom and my car in 1998 styling. Yeah. I had the early version of of that and it was a big stupid thing that had to sit on top of the roof of my car to catch up to catch the satellite, like a disc or like some, some weird antenna that had to go up there.

Speaker 1:          03:31:53       They used to have to have to pick up the, uh, the gps and the satellites aren't any different, but the receivers are like, can be a lot smaller and fucking phones in your fucking things up while it's in your pocket. They're tracking you while it's in your pocket, in your car, as you're driving course, when it's off, when it's, I don't trust any of these electronics. I use them. I'm not going to throw my fucking phone away and, and if I do forget it, there's no board horrifying feeLing than driving away from your house and go, oh fuck, I don't have my tracking device. And you will turn around and get it because you can't function without it. It's everything to people. Again, if, if there was that emp or whatever the fuck it is, that just zaps the grid, you would say pandemonium in no time.

Speaker 1:          03:32:39       Well, you would see pandemonium. It was just the power grid went down for any reason. If someone like a terrorist attack took out the power grid, we need power way more than we think we do. Oh, absolutely. You think nothing of. We in New York, we had a hurricane a few years ago, like five or six years ago, I guess it was, and I'm the one that took out jersey and long island and stuff. And uh, we went nine days without power in the house on long island. And you could see it fraying around the edges, man. Society, just the first couple of days you'd be on online at the gas station of philip jerry cans to take back to your generators at the house. And it's like, oh, okay. Excuse me. Oh no. Oh, you were first guy had got hit by that seventh, eighth day. It got, fuck.

Speaker 1:          03:33:27       You know, I was standing here. Go fuck yourself. Get to the back of the line now. Could you imagine if that was you trying to get your kids medication or something or food like it just goes a little longer and now foods getting a little scarce, you are going to have a problem and I am stunned. It hasn't happened to any extent. Really. We saw, we saw close with katrina, I think, uh, and violence started. That was, that was a little out of hand, but use app that grid give people, they have nothing. I wound up getting a giant fucking, like a cummings generator. This thing like is for backup power at hospitals. So when the power goes out in my neighborhood, literally my pool is running flood lights in the backyard. Every tv's on it comes on automatically. It just sit there as if fuel with, eh, it's a liquid propane, but I have to 1000 gallon tanks buried in my front yard.

Speaker 1:          03:34:26       What? So it would, it would, it would last for a long fucking time. Lungs in time. Uh, uh, depending on how much you use because, uh, the more, uh, the more draw on it, the heart of the engine's got to work. So it depends if I'm running my whole house, I don't know, it would last a few weeks and it's safe to that propane to be in those cans on underground? No, they're a giant tax. They're running natural gas into my neighborhood so I might have a converted over to natural gas. But I like the fact that if the gas breaks too, I can still at least jacka an lp truck somewhere and fill up my own tank. You know, crazy push came to shove, but it is just every light in the house can be on my neighborhood's dark. I'm just looking at it like an half fuckers that happened. A. Yeah. Yeah. A few times. I'm waiting for a big one though. Like I really want to be bad blackout just so I can dig it and know that you're the guy with the power that say the guy with refrigerants where the guns come in.

Speaker 1:          03:35:26       like it really is it. There is something a little creepy about the pRospect that we are really delicately balanced as a society. It could really fly apart. We truSt too much that the power is just going beyond thAt the water's gonna run that the food's going to be at the supermarket or whatever the fuck it is. like you got a great advantage being able to hunt. They get how many people don't know. Do you know what american refugees would look like? The fat fucking mess. Crossing some border to Canada to be saved from some cataclysm that happened down here. What? A bunch of fucking. Just weak soft. No nothing. Every convenience they've used for years. Just not trained in the feeding yourself outside in the wild. They have no idea. You ever skin an animal? You ever kill something to eat a do? Do you know how to get water from just the humidity in the air or there are things that we just don't know because we depend on technology and we trust that it's always going to be there because it has been.

Speaker 1:          03:36:30       I mean, you know, we get very complacent, but that's why if it ever failed, whoa, fuck you better hunker down somewhere. It's crazy. Indeed. And on that note, do we just did like four hours on it seems like it flew right by. Did floor. That is nuts, joe. I gotta. Thank you man. Thank you. I love being on your show for real. You're the reason why this all happened. It's crazy now. People know it's fucking nuts. I, I love it. I love always good seeing my friend very much. Cool. Oh, the gentleman. Yeah. He's got a book out permanently suspended. Available, uh, anywhere. Go to compound media.com for all the details. All right.

Speaker 5:          03:37:12       Oh yeah. Awesome.
