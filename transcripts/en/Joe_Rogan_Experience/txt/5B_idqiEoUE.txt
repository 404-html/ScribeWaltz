Speaker 1:          00:00:10       Hey everybody, what's up man, thanks for doing this. I appreciate it. Oh, it's an honor man. There's so many people that I really enjoy and respect have been contacting me about having you on. So when they found out that I was having you on Michael Mouse, everybody, Ladies and gentlemen, uh, and when they were, uh, when I was saying that you were going to be on, when people heard about it, they get super pumped. So that's very, very flattering. Yeah. And Dave Smith, who I love, very great friend of mine, he's a great guy. He was super psyched. Oh yeah, sure. So welcome sir. Thank you, Mr. Again, it's a good time for you to be here to men. It seems like we might be going to war with North Korea, so, uh, your book, dear reader, but I held it up. Yeah, it was probably an important book for people that are like, um, what exactly is going on over there?

Speaker 1:          00:00:54       Well, that's what I wrote it. So that everything you read in the press, this is crap. Really. Everything. Pretty much. Yeah. What's, uh, what are they getting wrong? They're getting wrong that uh, so there was an article a couple of years ago, so the example I always used where you had all these women marching in Pyongyang, the capital city and the headlines said, Kim Juggling's mini skirted robot army, and you know how, how they are all, they're all brainwashed and robots. It's like they're all hostages. If someone puts a gun to your mom's head, you're going to march. If someone puts a gun to your head, you're going to do it. You need to do to get that kid food. These are human beings who are in prison and of course they do crazy silly things, wouldn't you? Of course. Yeah. And the press is like, ah. It's also like they believe this silly shit.

Speaker 1:          00:01:37       You go to school and you're taught something and if you don't believe it, you go to a labor camp, you're going to smile and fucking not. But it's not a course. You read the articles and it's just like liquid. These stupid people believe. It's like, yeah, no. You look at these hostages. Believe yeah. That's a better way of putting it for sure. Do you really think though, that people aren't aware that some people aren't aware of it, of what? Of, of what a dictatorship, a military dictatorship, essentially. I have it down to 45 seconds when I did an interview with an NPR affiliate and the woman said, well, Kim Jong Il, so very campy figure. And I said, well, that's uhm ill, that's the one I wrote the book about the Dad. And she goes, he's a very campy figure. I go, well, that's a very unfortunate choice of words and she wants to kill herself because it's upon and concentration camps, you know, so I mean if you look at like the interview, which got it right because they said he's an evil killer, but you look a team of America and they look at him as this clown figure.

Speaker 1:          00:02:31       And I always say the joker from Batman is a clown, but you're not looking at all the bodies behind him. So yeah, he's silly and a buffoon. But this buffoon has millions of corpses to his name. And you think it's wacky that they're marching in a parade? Well yeah, I mean for, in team America's defense though, that's what those guys do and that's what they did with Saddam Hussein. Remember they made them the gay lover to Satan of course. But I'm saying is I think a lot of people in the. I'm talking at the press specifically, they take that they take a lot of North Korea at face value. So why I wrote the book is so like you can understand what the hell's going on there because it's all smoke and mirrors with them. Well it is one of the most public and one of the most visible military dictatorships and still still viable.

Speaker 1:          00:03:13       Yes. In 2017, which is really, it's, it's kind of shocking that mean when you can walk down the street and Los Angeles and you know, go to, you know, go to starbucks and get a coffee and everything's free and people, you know, there's billboards protesting this and people talking about that. And then there's this certain amount of freedom that we just completely take for granted. We think, well this is what life is like in 2017. Sure. It is in Los Angeles, but in North Korea you might as well be living a thousand years ago. A actually what's funny is different people are living at different times. When I landed on the plane, there was an army guy who stopped the rich lady and he was like from the fifties and she was from the eighties in their clothes. So they have different time periods overlapping there. So how's that? Explain that.

Speaker 1:          00:03:58       Basically he's in fifties, Russian gear, like the soldier. And he stopped shaving gear. Yeah, because they're their Soviet Soviet. Right. So they really were like Russia, that Russia issue or a Russian style. It's like green and they've got the gold, but it looks cheap. You know what I mean? That fabric, it's it. It doesn't look contemporary. The cut, I don't know what it is, but something about the. I just look at, you're like, this is communist era stuff and he stops at the airport and it's obviously like papers please. And this was within 10 minutes of me being in the capital and she rolls her eyes at him, which I was shocked. And she goes and she's on her cell phone and she's like, and she digs through her purse, shows him something and he nods and she keeps going because what's happening now is wealthy people in North Korea can run the government and run their way around the law, which is great as long as they run a foul of.

Speaker 1:          00:04:46       Correct. Correct. But in which case they just get killed. It depending. But yeah. So when you're in power, like the laws don't apply to you. It's not that everyone's scared the cops. It's when you're, when you're rich, you can have a huge black market. You can bribe your way out of anything. So how do people get rich in a communist dictatorship. So what happened in the nineties when Kim Jong Il chose to have a famine and chose to have millions of people starve rather than lose his hold on power. They started looking the other way and all these little markets that popped up, blue black markets because the government wasn't providing food anymore. So people would go to China and trade stuff and come back and you know, they'd get rice and so on and so forth. So these markets are now the backbone in many ways of the North Korean economy and yet the cops can come and hassle you, but you got to bribe that cop.

Speaker 1:          00:05:32       But it just basically works out to attacks. Wow. So these people are essentially running black markets inside of this communist dictatorship and just paying off the cops so they can keep all this going. It's public, it's in the town square, but it's not. They don't regard themselves as communist anymore and it's not. It's much closer. Many ways to fascism then to Hitler style, fascism and communism. So the, are they putting their money in a North Korean bank? Well that's the trick. So they used to have like the money stuffed in mattresses and then North Korea said, we're switching currency tomorrow. You got to switch it out there. Forty eight hours. And everyone started going broke. So the government figures out what the people do. Here's something else that goes and fucks him over every step of the way. Here's something else that used to happen. It used to be if you go to China, right to escape, you just bribe the border guard because he's hungry and then you go to China and do what you need to do and you come back, right.

Speaker 1:          00:06:25       Let's suppose you're trading and he gets a cut now they changed it to he can keep the bribe as long as he arrest you. So He lets you go and then he comes back, he takes all your shit and he keeps his money and you get in trouble. Oh Wow. So they're very smart. So they did that to discourage bribes and encourage a wrestle. Right. To keep their control. And do the North Koreans know this now they stopped trying to bribe these guys. Look after a few of them, but I'm rusting. Well it keeps kind of changing and then it's all this. You never know ahead of time. It's like a drug deal. Is this guy cool? Is this guy not cool? And that's what so much of it is like know talking between the lines and, and working with people. And who do you know and who's close and it's all these slight of hand kind of things.

Speaker 1:          00:07:05       It's just when you see something like what they're doing is in terms of what the way the government is running the country. It's when you watch it on television, you. My feeling is how long can they keep this up forever, you think? Well, no, not for much longer than they should have because here's what happened in the nineties. The famine hit right? And I can explain why I get into my book. The UN came to give them food and Kim Jong Il said, well if the UN is giving people food, they're not gonna need the government. So what they would do is people in the UN, we're not allowed to have any Korean speakers on staff. So they went to village a on Monday and they saw healthy people and they went to village be on Tuesday and then Wednesday they went back to the first village and the Koreans are like, oh, this is a third village.

Speaker 1:          00:07:50       They go, we were just hearing Monday. And they go, no, you weren't. And it's like, what are you going to tell them? And eventually the UN left. They're like, fuck this, we can't help these people. So they were willing to let the population on. So the first village was pretending to be a new village? No, the right, correct. Not even pretending it's just obviously the same village, but they're lying to their site where they saying that they were a different village because that way they're saying we showed you three towns and everything's fine. So it was basically they just put people there to act and behind the story. Did you ever see the vice piece when Shane Smith went to North Korea and they pretended to have a restaurant? No. So he got that wrong in my opinion. So what the senior talking about is he's in the hotel and I, I think I stayed in the same room as him and that hotel, it's nicknamed the Alcatraz of fun because it's on an island in the middle of the river, in the middle of young gang.

Speaker 1:          00:08:34       So they took them to this ballroom and they are, you know, distributing food to all these tables. But no one's there, and he asked the waitress, he goes, whereas everyone, and she goes, they just left what I perceived that to be and I don't, I'm not inside her head. Of course, in North Korea, I, when I was there, I'm like, I got to figure out what the rules are because I was born in the Soviet Union. You had these little rules to figure out what works and what does it. And what it was is you can never acknowledge anything's wrong because if you do, that's complaining and complaining, criticizing the government. So if he, if she had said this, food's all wasted. She's making complaint. Right? But if she is doing improv and she's like, everything's fine, then the best you can to come up with is everyone just left this.

Speaker 1:          00:09:13       Everything's so. You have to maintain disappearance that everything's good all the time. His perception was, and she's on camera. Keep that in mind. Does she know what she's on camera for? It doesn't. It doesn't matter if you're a hostage on camera, you're going to smile and nod. Aren't the worst one was Laura Ling, uh, she was interviewing this family in the capital city and she goes, can Kim Jong Il do anything wrong? And they pretended that they didn't understand her and she, and she's like, I'm like, wait a minute, you're asking a family on camera to criticize the government, are you and are you insane? Yeah. What is wrong with you woman? And it's the wrong way to do it. Yeah. Shane's perception was that they had set this place up as a restaurant and it wasn't really a restaurant because they don't really have restaurants per se, and that they were trying to pretend and put on this air like they were a normal society and you can just go to the restaurant and bar some food.

Speaker 1:          00:10:05       But when he went in there, he said the whole thing was clearly set up just for them. That's I, I didn't go to that restaurant he went to. So I can't speak on that. They do. And I went later than him. They do have restaurants for sure in Pyongyang. We went to several. They're crappy. Um, but a lot of the stuff that is for show, it's pretty easy to tell what's for showing what isn't. So if he's saying that this whole thing was a setup just for him, that's plausible. Yeah, that was what he was thinking. He was thinking that they were putting on like a big pr display for him because when I went, when you go to the maternity hospital, a lot of that stuff is clearly for show because there's computers but they're not even plugged in maternity hospitals. Yeah. They're very proud of their maternity hospital, maternity, paternity to where you have kids.

Speaker 1:          00:10:44       What's a maternity? Sorry. I think Russia now. So they have computers that aren't even plugged in. Right. Why do they. So what's, what's fake about it? Like the computers are for display purposes only. So it's like, oh, we go online, we are advanced, we have science and you know, you go into a lab and someone's at a microscope, you know, cutting edge technology, they don't look up. It's like listen, if you're working at a microscope and 20 people walk in the room, you're just going to glance stuff instinctively. So everyone essentially as a hostage from even from the police down to the doctors to including the leaders themselves. So when these countries liberalized like Libya and Iraq, the leaders themselves are killed. So even if Kim Jong going wanted things to loosen up, he's going to get a bullet in him and with good reason. So it's a system where everyone is a prisoner.

Speaker 1:          00:11:33       Kim Jong Il became a big missed because he married a woman in secret and then his dad, the great leader, Kim Il Sung was like, when are you going to get married? He's like, student Dad soon. And then his dad's like, I found a wife for you. And he's like, okay. So he married a second woman and kept his first emily and hidden compound. And that was, that was that first son who was just recently killed. Wow. And this was the son that was killed by Kim Jong Aoun because they thought that they were trying to organize a coup against him. Well, it's not even if they're trying. So North Korea has a constitution, which is for display purposes only, but what really governs the country is the 10 commandments of Kim Il Sung. And the 10th commandment is, I forget what it is, something there. It's the revolution shall be continued through the generations until it's completed.

Speaker 1:          00:12:16       Which means only a descendant of Kim Il Sung can be the leader. So Kim Jong, Il had three sons. The middle one is a sissy, so he doesn't count. He's assisted. Yeah, they said he's too much like a girl, like that's all we know about him. And he's a big Eric Clapton for certain pit all like this guy, pictures of this guy. There's some online. You sit in their shoes. Off they left. So the eldest son was Kim Jong Nam and the youngest was Kim Jong, Il and Kim Jong Nam wanted to liberalize Kim Jong. Il Said No. So if Kim Jong UN is going to be replaced, the only one who could have replaced him was his older brother Kim Jong Nam. So if he's killed, that's an insurance policy. Oh. So he killed him just to make sure that he wasn't overthrown. Yeah, and he killed his sons to right now he killed his, his, his aunt's husband.

Speaker 1:          00:13:06       Oh Jesus. But she drove his, her daughter to suicide. So there are, it's game of thrones in humans. Six, six, six stuff. And they boast about. I mean when I was doing my research for the book, they don't, they boast about all the shit they do, like North Korea was recently criticized by the UN for having concentration camps and they literally said we don't use that term so we don't have any. That was their response. What are you going to do about it? Well, they've got a point. Yeah. Case case claims. If they don't use the point, they don't use that term. There you go. Something different. Yeah. So there, there's so many layers of hell in this country that it, it, you know, why I like speaking about it is someone's got to do it and people don't know what's going on and it's, it kinda bothers me.

Speaker 1:          00:13:52       You know, when you hear people on TV trying to give their opinion and they don't know the actual data, it's so much worse than people think. Yeah, there's, well we have a very peripheral knowledge of it, like in terms of like what's put out on mainstream media. We know that it's bad, but we know that it's a dictatorship. We know that the people are under the iron thumb. Right. But we don't know too much more. Right? Right. So I had to do all the homework and now you can read this book and now you have everything you need to know. And when you went over there, what, what year did you go over there? In 2012. So Kim John took over in 2011. Eleven. So he had already taken over. Correct. So what was it? What was the. This was like post all the crying and the streets.

Speaker 1:          00:14:33       Oh yeah, the craziness. Oh yeah. Did you want to be there for that? That must've been fascinating to watch that there's nothing in North Korea that's not fascinating because when you're going through the city, you know, in the countryside, everything's there for a reason and you're looking around, you're like, why did they make this like this? And you're not going to have an answer because everything is constructed, you know what I mean? So you're trying to find analogs between what's, what you know to be saying and what they have. And sometimes it's not obvious I was, they showed us, they took us to this place and they claim that there's an invisible wall that we built that separates the Koreas right. And you can only see the wall from the north and this is to keep the Koreas divided permanently. I got the brochure and they, the you, your little telescope and you're like, what am I looking at?

Speaker 1:          00:15:13       Is this a wall? This is the path isn't mountainside. And there was a praying mantis there. And I told my guide, I go, Yo, I thought this was a communist country. And atheist country wise, they're praying Mantis, ha ha. And she's like, I have no idea. We're talking about. And then I'm like, okay, well, I mean they're not going to call a praying mantis. They must have a different word. So I said, well, this reminds me of my favorite fable, the Fox in the Scorpion, you know, the Fox and Scorpion one across the river. I thought it was a frog. It's, it's either, right? So we could do frog and score for foxes can swim. That's where the frogs can swim. Two Scorpion. Yeah. Yeah. So far.

Speaker 1:          00:15:49       So the frog says, uh, the Scorpion says, let me hop on your back so I can cross the river. And the frog goes, had I know you won't sting me. And Scorpion goes, if I stinky, we both drowned and halfway through the Scorpion stings him and says, the frog goes, why'd you Stingley road dying? And the Scorpion goes, that's my nature. And I told this to my God and she's like, what's a scorpion? I'm like, okay. So I'm like, it's like the lobster that lives in the desert, she has no idea. I'm like, I draw it. She'd never heard of it. And you think how many times you've heard of a scorpion from comic books, from nature shows, from nature books, you know, just logos, the horoscope, and it's like holy shit, like her level of what is known is so limited that even something as basic as that is completely foreign to her because they don't have scorpions in North Korea, so you don't need to know about it.

Speaker 1:          00:16:33       It's just, it's so fascinating that in the same time period as the internet and Google, Uber Satellites, Ilan mosque, all the crazy shit that we're experiencing that these people are essentially completely isolated. Yeah. Other than what, how many websites is like 18 websites or something like that? Very low on their North Korean internet. Intranet. Yeah. Intranet. Yeah, right. Which for folks like intranet is what corporations and companies use to share in internal knowledge. And so they have a system set up like that and so these people that want to go quote unquote online, that's what they're going to get. They're getting only very few people are going to have that access also. It's amazing. Yeah. I mean it's terrifying. It's horrifying and it doesn't seem like it has a solution, but it's also amazing and it doesn't have to be this way. Well, what could be done?

Speaker 1:          00:17:24       I just mean this is being done intentionally. Oh, for sure. And, and this is being done methodically. So when I was doing the research, it's like, uh, the Russian writer, Iran said something like, um, heirs of this magnitude I'd never made innocently. So this was a step by step process from the great leader, Kim Il Sung and the director Kim Jong Il, to slowly close the walls and these people and to keep it as airtight and as much like a prison as possible. It was a very step by step by step over the decades. And you, and you know, as, as you read the history, you could just feel the walls closing in. But we were talking recently about the wailing and the streets when Kim Jong Il died. And about how people who did not, they didn't cry hard enough, were sentenced to six months of hard labor. Right? So what they have there is, you know, people again, when you think it's just the dictatorship, so everyone in North Korea is slotted into some group, like your school, your workplace, maybe the young workers, women's, whatever.

Speaker 1:          00:18:22       Once a week your whole group has to get together and you have to stand up and say what you did wrong and then your other friends have to get up and denounce you and say what they saw you doing wrong and they better have something to say. Right. So everyone is watching each other all the time. So it's almost like Aa, right, like from hell. So this has been going on since the seventies. So people are like, why don't they just get together and revolt? You can't revolt when everyone around you is looking to make sure they have something to tell about you at your weekly meeting. It's really kind of brilliant. It is. Absolutely. That's the thing when people like these people are crazy and stupid, like this is brilliant. They have it all worked out and it's working for them. Well it's, it's a conspiracy at the highest level.

Speaker 1:          00:19:02       Yes. I mean really is the entire country is a massive conspiracy. Yes. Fucking stunning. Really, when you really look at it that way, that this is how many million people? A 24 million. Fucking incredible. Yeah. Yeah. And that they've been put in. Everyone's like, they're suicidal, they've outlasted everybody except for Cuba. Then the last one standing and they gloat about it and they should be gloating about it. It's essentially Los Angeles, but prison, it's not. Los Angeles was a prison but larger than Los Angeles. Well, you guys have warm weather. They have cold weather and they don't have warm clothes and the population, so yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh yeah. Even just the population size of Los Angeles and yet everyone's a prisoner. Everyone's a prison. Yeah. Fucking incredible. So I just want people to keep that in mind next time they are laughing at one of these articles or like how stupid these people are.

Speaker 1:          00:19:51       It's like you are going to believe whatever you need to believe in prison. Well people don't really look into it. I mean when you see these goofy fucking haircut, right. You know, and then you know, there was some sketch recently where he made everybody get the same haircut. That's a myth. It was a sketch comedy sketch, but it was just there. It was like, ah, yeah, this is a stupid aircraft. Whoa. Oh, what's Britney spears up to her? Just going crazy with Jennifer Lopez. Grow toward. Were those Kim Kim corridor ocean. It was a girls and we just move on to the next ridiculous thing and the reason he has that haircut is because that's the haircut that great leader his grandfather had in the forties. So He's like, I'm my grant. When Kim Jong Il took over in 1994, his campaign slogan was, do not expect any change for me. That was literally on the billboards. I am the same person as my dad was who got in trouble recently for having a Hitler haircut. There was a story recently, someone in Europe, some kid in Europe was kicked

Speaker 2:          00:20:48       out of something for essentially having a Hitler haircut, which is like today, my friend Moshe, Moshe Kasher has a Hitler haircut and he's just a hipster. Hitler youth had that couple of years ago. It's like shaved on the sides and I kind of have a little bit. I mean if you lift the top, grow a little bit more. Yeah. But I mean that's a, that's kind of like what he's rocking. He's rocking this retro haircut. Yeah. Yeah. And with good reason and we think it's silly. You know, we, we just hee, he ha ha. Right. But meanwhile we're watching this mass atrocity go on. Yes. Yeah. And it's funny for me because every time I talk about it, everyone I met is still there. Like everyone I saw on the street, it's still there. Every little kid I saw still there, my guide is still there. Uh, who was a very sweet young lady and it was heartbreaking and I hate being one of those people who like, oh, I went on this trip and it changed my life, you know, like the whole facebook shit.

Speaker 2:          00:21:37       But it fucks with your head for years because of being Jewish, being born in the Soviet Union. Those were, this is why I took on this project. Those are chances for me to have been in a camp, you know, back in the day for sure. So to see. My friend is also from Russia. He goes, it looks like Russian people, the architecture and the clothes, but it's just Asian people in them. He's like, it's a total mind. Fuck. Well, it's also fascinating when you consider the small amount of time between the concentration camps or the Holocaust and today, I mean we look, I'm almost 50. I turned 50 in August, which when I was a child seemed like an eternity and now as a man is almost 50. It seems like a just happened. Well, the rush. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Which is 50 years ago, you know, we're, we're just out of the Holocaust, but 50 years ago we're just into the Vietnam war.

Speaker 2:          00:22:21       Right, right. I mean, it's so quick. It's so recent. I mean, what we think of as modern, we think of as like modern civilization. It's only modern civilization and a couple of spots. Right? And this was the attitude right before World War One, remember, they're like, we're civilized now. There's never going to be wars again. We've got all figured out and then World War One happens and they're like, what the fuck just happened when I was a boy I was living in San Francisco and um, it was all like we were right off of Lombard street is where we lived, was a really crooked street. And um, I remember when the Vietnam War ended, I remember because I remember thinking, I don't want to go to war. I'm glad they figured this out was a little kid. I was like, good, we're done with war. Thank God. And then when I was, I think I was 21 or 22 thing, I was 21 when the Gulf War broke out and I was sitting there with my friend Jimmy, my roommate at the time, we're sitting in our apartment watching the missiles. They showed that night vision scene of the missiles flying and he was like, Holy Shit Buddy, we're at fucking war. And I was like, this is crazy. I thought we were done with this. Oh yeah, and you mean the second Iraq war? The first one. Okay. Desert Storm. That was what it was at 89, eight, 99, somewhere around that and so I was 2198. [inaudible] 90? Yes. Okay. Stunning. To me at the time because I was like, how is this possible? This is. We're still

Speaker 3:          00:23:46       doing this. I thought we were done. I thought we were finished with Vietnam. I thought we realized like as a culture, like hey, this is something we need to evolve past, but it's just so recent. There's so much pro war propaganda. Like on the one hand you'll hear how bad war is and then you'll hear the glorification of FDR and Woodrow Wilson and like if you look at the end of the Cold War, Reagan Thatcher and Gorbachev, they ended it without a shot. They fried half the world from this communist dictatorship and that's almost like an asterisk and it's like that's the way to do it. Like if you want to end a war, do it peacefully and without the body count. I want to avoid the body count. I don't want the funerals. I don't want the destroyed buildings and people just on some level of revel in that.

Speaker 3:          00:24:24       Both in the right and the left. Well, one thing that's undisputable is that if you look back a long enough, we are clearly evolving. Human beings are across the board pretty much except for places like North Korea, like Steven Pinker, yes. Yeah. Perfect example. What he's talking about is if you go what anybody's talking about, if you go back a thousand years ago and you look at today with it's inarguable that this is a far safer place to live. Yes. Far more inclusive. People are far more understanding, compassionate and far more willing to be open to strangers. It's a different world, but like how does anyone get past this? This is the thing that freaks me out when it comes to something like North Korea. It's like when you have this absolute power at the top, like Libya, like when Walmart Kadafi was killed and then you get rid of that, you have this fucking chaos.

Speaker 3:          00:25:17       Right? And how does that ever help those people that lived there? It's almost like those people that live there, those 20 plus million people that live in North Korea, it's almost like they can't be fixed. Like, Oh, you're wrong. That's not what I meant. I didn't mean like it's impossible, but I mean it's like they're so programmed to living in this environment and they're so under the grip of this guy. Right? If you take that guy out, don't you think there'll be some kind of a massive power vacuum that some will try to fill a. yes. That's one concern. However, like I've met refugees and they're the most annoying, boring teenagers you'd ever hope to meet, which is great because I want my goal is that a wish. I want these people to be sitting on lazy boys with their bucket of Kimchi and the pounder and watching two pounder like a, like a beer.

Speaker 3:          00:26:01       The telomere, right? Oh, and just watching tv like everybody, everyone else, like they have the right to just be lazy assholes. Like that's all I want for these people and a lot of times they are very. They get acclimated pretty easily. It's a big surprise. Individuals, if they leave that environment, what I'm talking about is the environment itself. It's going to be extremely tough transition because it's been 70 years of dictatorship and abuse in isolation, you know, when you have a country that's programmed in that way that essentially has been programmed from birth and I was reading an article about a kid that was born in a prison camp escape from camp 14. Yes, yes. Which is horrific, right? I mean that is a horrific account of like the different stages

Speaker 1:          00:26:44       of physical depletion that the prisoners would be like. So like if you're at this stage, you can be assigned to physical labor and you get to this point, you can't do physical labor anymore and he's drawing pictures of what these people look like and if you kill yourself, your family has to fulfill your quota. So even death is not an escape from the North Korean regime is. It's a fucking stunning. So what happens? I mean, how is there even a conceivable plan? The only way. So first of all, China doesn't want 24 million people who don't speak Chinese, who have no skills whatsoever crossing the two men and Yellow River's intervention area and setting up camp there. That's their concern. However they started backing down and that's the greatest possible thing. So what would happen is household backing down, meaning they started standing up to North Korea. They've, they were like refusing to exports.

Speaker 1:          00:27:31       They sat down with trump and clearly talked about North Korea. There's no way trump is running his mouth without having a plan with them. I'm sure that's the case. They were very friendly with Mara Lago. Um, so golf. What's that? They like golf and hookers don't like golf somebody because that's the whole thing. It's capitalist now had this whole thing against golf. This was a big controversy. Yes, it's, it's the, it's the sport of millionaires. A, I say. Yeah, but isn't China like a totally different environment now we're getting off track though. I don't want continue less joking around, but the point is once that government is somehow vanished and I have no idea how that would happen, you would have to have China, Russia, South Korea and Japan and us working together to kind of have a Marshall Plan of some kind. That's the only way that's going to happen.

Speaker 1:          00:28:12       And even in a Marshall Plan. Well, how do you deal with all those people and give them meaningful employment and give them some sort of a new philosophy or a new culture or new. Some sort of government. I don't think it would be that hard really. I really don't because it's not. There's not like there's agent like this, the Muslim Brotherhood, whatever. These are people who want food, clothes, a roof over their heads and opportunities for their kids. South Korea who's the same people has the highest per capita income of any country in Asia, which is saying a lot, so it would just be. It would not be easy and it would be a long process, but I don't think it would be as much of a shit show as like Libya or Syria or any of these other places. That's interesting. Why do you think it'd be easier? Because I think once they find out how much they've been lied to and now they have like, look it just go to this office work nine to five gifts.

Speaker 1:          00:29:05       They're very hard working because their slaves. Right? So they don't sound like they don't have a work ethic. It's not like they're not ambitious, it's just like they're ambitious gonna get them nowhere and frankly the ones who were the most loyal to the regime were the ones who starved in the nineties because they thought food's coming, food's coming, food's coming, and the ones who are shady and who were like, I'm going to get fed by any means necessary. Who are entrepreneurial? They're the ones who survived. When you left that place and you got back home and you're sitting there and you're about to put this book together and you're thinking about this world that you just escaped from. Yeah. What do you. How does this play out? Do you, did you, did you think like where this goes? Did you like look at what you saw and come up with some possible scenarios for how this eventually plays out?

Speaker 1:          00:29:48       Well, I had one quote from either having their Steinbeck and the quote was, how did you go bankrupt two ways gradually and then suddenly, so it's going to happen overnight. We're not going to see it coming. Uh, I don't. I think all those countries around North Korea, I've agreed it's a problem. All those country like this is a fucking nightmare. And I think just like with the first world war, Gulf War, they would very quickly get together and be like, all right, we can't have this exploding some nightmare. Let's work together and figure this shit out. I think it'd be a very, very, uh, difficult but not difficult. Ideological audiologically a plan to come forward. It's so fascinating when you compare them to South Korea, which is thriving economy. He makes some of the best electronics in the world or the best phones and televisions and you know, and it's just amazing that they're right next door to each other and there's such a consensus internationally that, that this place is evil.

Speaker 1:          00:30:42       You know what I mean? It's not like, you know, Libya where these other countries have their back and you're ran a rock and all this other stuff with us. More religious though, right? And with this they don't. No one has their back, like maybe some weird African countries they have allies with, but everyone in that region is like, all right, this shit's a nightmare and enough's enough. Well, it's fucking hilarious. Whenever they try to show some display a power and they have a launch of like some missile that shoots 13 feet up in the air and then explode. That could be intentional. You think so? So they can't back down ever. Right. But if you want to back down without backing down is you make a mistake. Right. So it looks like you don't have the power. Really. That's, that's where I would put my money.

Speaker 1:          00:31:19       Wow. That's, that's some weird fucking multilevel chest. They are. They've been playing multilevel chest since the forties. They didn't have, but they're all about face about showing like that. That's one of the things about Korea will all I know about a South Korea. I know quite a bit about South Korean culture and the way I grew up learning and teaching taekwondo. So I was around a lot of Koreans and they're very much about honor and they're very much about hard work and they're very much about appearances, right? Like the idea of giving up, like showing a weakness like that intentionally seems pretty alien. Well the choice is, are you. If trump says if you go forward with this, we're going to attack you. So that's not on the table. So plan B isn't like, okay, we're going to give in plan b would be to act like you're defying him, but not actually defining it.

Speaker 1:          00:32:06       That sounds so ridiculous. It's fascinating though. I'm not disagreeing with their shit. I mean I, that's where I would put my money because think about it, if you are doing these tests, you're going to be, you're going to be testing it and publicly how many times, like in America you're going to have some, you know, I guess windows crashes, but people go through this over and over, especially when your life is at risk, right? So you're going to make damn sure that it's going to be working before you announced, you know, April 14th. We're having our big launch, right, but aren't they developing this technology in a vacuum as opposed to most of the rest of the world? Like if you're. You're dealing with United States, right? The United States is,

Speaker 3:          00:32:40       first of all, we have the internet. Second of all, we have some of the very best aerospace engineers in the world. The most knowledgeable people in terms of rocketry and explosions and all that shit like you're dealing with is fantastic database of human beings to draw from, but they're isolated like wouldn't it make sense that their stuff kind of sucks, but what I'm saying is if it sucks, they would do the test privately and in some hidden place until they got the kinks out. Then they would publicly do it when they've got the kinks out. Why would you publicly show your hand unless you had a purpose? While they probably don't have enough money to run nearly enough tests like we. We know that they have done some tests that we've observed, but remember there was a. There was some concern. They detonated a nuke.

Speaker 3:          00:33:23       You have nukes 100 percent, but there was concern that they had detonated run under, I believe it was underground. Yeah, it was a few years back. Right. But my point is we don't know, and this would be something that would be up their alley and it would be. I don't understand why they would announce something unless they were sure they could do it because that's really about face. It's like, you know, here's our big launch and then you turn on the TV doesn't work. That's amazing. I never thought of that. You might be right, but it's. It's fascinating to think about it that way. Does anybody share your opinion? Is this a call? Yes. I mean really it's not. It's not like there's a huge community of people who understand North Korea, but this is what people who have watched the country do share is the consensus that you can't take shit at face value ever with them.

Speaker 3:          00:34:03       Wow, that's amazing. That's a really amazing sort of strategy. If that really is the case, it's really very self aware. Yes. We'll look at. Look at La. Two years ago, my buddy called me. They had a, they had a photo they released if Kim Jong Il and on his Mac book and behind him was a map of the US where the nukes are going to hit, including Austin. My friend calls me goes, are they get a Nuke Austin? It's like, listen, if I'm looking Austin, why the fuck am I putting this on my instagram? Like what are you talking about? You know? And of course they didn't Nuke Austin, Austin, I don't. I mean maybe they know how many bullets are in Texas when they passed the last place to invade. Well, the way they operate like this, like there's two types of bank robbers, right? There's the bank robber comes in, shoots up the ceiling, gets diluted, gets out.

Speaker 3:          00:34:45       Then there's the bank robber comes in, shoots up everyone, and you know, you deal with the first one when they were firing their missiles, they're fragmented the ocean, they're not firing them into Tokyo or Seoul. That's telling, right? Yeah. Well they don't want to get killed right there. They want to show that they have metal, right? And they want to say, hey, we can launch a missile at Los Angeles, or I sold 10 million people. I mean, you can't even. I mean, they're like, what about nukes? What about nukes? I said, that's on Fox. The other day. He goes, you really nuke smokes. You care about missiles hitting those skyscrapers and soul. Can you even imagine what that would look like? It would be like independence day. It'd be insane. And it's close. It's extremely close. So the missiles would get there in a matter of minutes, if not, if not even lying. Yeah. Um, what do you think about the theory that's been run back and forth pretty recently? That the United States sabotage those same way they sabotage the Iranian? That

Speaker 2:          00:35:38       would be great. That would be. I don't know what I'm talking about. Sap knows. Okay. They sabotaged the Iranian nuclear program with viruses and they're saying that it could perhaps have been the same case with North Korea, that they sabotage the missile program with some sort of computer environment that we have. That also is very plausible. Would it be hacking or would it be something along the lines of someone clandestine selling some sort of, you know, technology to them that turns out to be technology with an embedded virus. My understanding was it was hacking hacking. Allegedly. Allegedly. Yeah. But if they have. Okay. I'm not sure I understand how they would do that. Well, they are on there. I mean it's their online of kind of online. Right. So there would be a way to get to it, especially if China's helping us, you know, the, the ins and outs of international espionage and politics and sabotage and all that shit.

Speaker 2:          00:36:35       It is unbelievably fascinating to me and I think most people don't even have the slightest understanding of how deep that shit go and how hard people like in the CIA work and the people that are embedded in these essentially terrorist organizations like this was one of the things that came out about trump revealing to Russia that these laptops that isis was planning on using laptops for bombs and in doing so, he gave them top secret information that he felt he had the right to declassify it. Give it to them. Well, he claimed to have clients, but the people that have I that I've talked to that have an understanding, understanding of the intelligence community, say that in doing so, you compromise all the people that worked very hard to get to the position to find out that isis was doing this, so now isis has to take an account of all the people and some sort of an audit of all the people that they're in contact with and then try to figure out how the fuck this got out and who, who are the sketchy people or the questionable people and then puts people in danger and people have to flee and apparently they had to.

Speaker 2:          00:37:41       When trump did that, they had to alert the intelligence community like immediately, and this is one of the reasons why even though it seems benign to him on a surface level because he's thinking about a million different things, right? He's thinking about a million different things all at once and his lack of understanding about the importance and significance of top secret clearance according to the people that have. I, I've communicated with is why it's so dangerous for him to just talk about this stuff with Russia will also this whole thing where people are like, Oh, who cares about Hillary's server? It's just like I, this is the secretary of state. Are you equal kind of shit. She's got on there. Who the hell knows we have a real problem in this country of being on teams and we have a real problem in this country.

Speaker 2:          00:38:19       People that don't like trump thinking that hillary would have been a great president. It's a real problem because I'm not a fan of either. Right? And I think you as a, as a human being, should expect more from someone who wants to run the free world, right? Where I should expect someone. First of all, you'd expect someone who you can clearly tell is going to be honest. And you can tell that from either one of them. You want someone who has principles and sticks with them. You can't tell that from either one of them. You know, it's not what we need. We need something greater. And I think there's a great article and motherboard today, uh, about, it's essentially something that I've been saying for years that the United States is far too complicated to be run by a president and that the idea is antiquated. It was an idea that was created back when people came over here on boats.

Speaker 2:          00:39:05       Well, I had an article for the observer and article called the case for American succession. And the point I made was a, we've had two culture since the beginning and I agree with you completely to have one guy running everything or one woman is nuts. Well, what's thought to break stuff up when he fired comey that woke a lot of people up. It's like, well, you could just do that. You just fire the guy who's in charge of investigating him. Right? How the fuck does that work? I think it was also because Columbia, six, eight. Yeah. He's a giant dude. Yeah. And I, I, I, I can tell him what's that evening that bothered him. He tell you, telling me that trump doesn't like looking up to someone no way. Well, if the guy was totally down for him and hugged him back and told him that, listen, don't worry about it.

Speaker 2:          00:39:43       Your boyfriend's physically, he can look it up saying that if clint, but if, if Comi was like totally on board at a total trumpkins, if he came in and just acquiesce asked, you don't think that he'd still be on. He's still beyond, but trump didn't like it. He'd make him be sitting when he walks in a room with some shit. I mean he's a very petty person, which is what I admired about him. I was listening to Sam Harris podcast recently where they were, he was talking with two political experts. I forget their names, but two women who were talking about the case for succession succession or excuse me, the k, the case for impeachment, and they were essentially saying that his attention span is so short that they have to give them visual aids and they have to put his name as many times as they came in and memos because he searches for his name when he goes and reads from Amazon.

Speaker 2:          00:40:30       I don't know if that's true. I mean, I don't know if that's maybe some sneaky way of getting under his skin to get him to go fucking crazy, which like you're talking about multilevel chest with North Korea doing that thing. I would feel like if that's the way to fuck with the guy, it's still leak shit like this out and to say things like this, like he needs visual aids or he needs his name research funny. So he could rather his name mentioned multiple times and these memos. So he looks for his name. Well, there's me. Yeah. Well, I, I think people are so willing to believe the worst about people that they hate, that it gets cartoonish. I remember during the two thousands where some journalists said, I don't think George w dot Bush can read me like a healthy happy, and it's like he went to Harvard and Yale. Come on. Well, I don't hate trump. I don't. A lot of people think that it's a, it's a good thing to hate him. I hate him as president. I don't hate him as a person. I don't, I don't, I don't hate him. I don't know, doing this country a great service by making them suspicious of our democratic process that I've been making this argument for a couple of years on, on

Speaker 3:          00:41:34       on many different shows that it's very healthy for people to be like, if this is the outcome, you need to double check that this is the system you love. He's the monkey wrench in the gears of the model t. yeah, and we don't need a model t anymore. The Tesla, right? This is 2017, something far more advanced and what we can't just keep patching up the model to its current year. Yeah. We don't want windows 95 with all the upgrades for 2017. You get the fuck Outta here right now. Ninety five to have politics divided geographically is a very outdated way of looking at the. Yeah, and also to have representative governments very outdated. We don't need someone to represent us anymore. We can communicate instantaneously. Right. Everyone has a communication device essentially. Everyone except for. You're a crazy fucker. He doesn't even use a phone anymore, but everyone else is using modern cell phones where you could tweet for or you could, you could vote from anywhere in the world essentially.

Speaker 3:          00:42:26       Right? That's how it should be. Yes, we should have technology and we should have a government. I mean we should have rather a government that recognizes the current technology and utilize it to get the voice of the people out there. Well, the, the technology is what's actually making the government put in its place and it's going at an increasingly fast rates and integrative and it's also, what I'm fascinated by is all these trolls. Now. I'm a professional. I'm writing a book about this on trolls and the new, right? Yeah. Well the new. Well, it's not just the new, right? I mean you can call them the new right, but they could easily be left. What I'm fascinated by is these people that they. They belong to a group and they are in an identity group. Yeah, and that's what it is. You're telling me that green frog is outright.

Speaker 3:          00:43:10       No, man. That's people having a good time to chat. Held chapter with this. There's a group online on twitter who were yelling at me to shout them out. What are they called? I'm not going to say it because I said, well, tell me what the. Write it down. I'll shout them out. No, no, hold on. I said, you got Admin facebook, so I know your real name. I'm not shouting at somebody. Turns out to be a mass murderer and he wouldn't do it. I'm like, you're not getting a shout out, but he's a whole group as a whole group of Ms. Murder. Well, just the one guy like, shout out our leader. I'm like, you gotta give me your name while you can have a leader. Boys. I'm not shouting you out. If you have a leader. There shouldn't be any leaders. I don't think we should have leaders anymore.

Speaker 3:          00:43:40       I really don't. I think there's 350 million people in this country and the idea of leaders is some old school alpha chimp. Bullshit to say right here. That's the very first sentence in my book. Wow. When the world leader or leadership returns to currently. Yeah, man, you're, you're. You're essentially saying exactly that relapse into barbarism. That's a great word. Yeah. Barbarism is a great word. It is. Mussolini was. It'll do it. Yeah. He was the leader and this was patterson from what was 1943? Yeah. Yeah. Well, I think they recognized it back then and they, you know, it's escalated and compounded since then because society has gotten more complicated. We've gotten more diverse ideologically at remember in the eighties where every hack comedian would make a joke about how this diet coke and caffeine free coke and all these other cooks. It's like we still have two choices or politics.

Speaker 3:          00:44:31       Why? Yeah, I know. Isn't that amazing? That was in the 19 eighties. Yeah. We had 100 different kinds of cokes and coke. New Coke was terrible. He doesn't read. He's too young. Jamie's very erudite, man. You ever knew coach Jimmy? He knows things that from coke classic to the new coke. Did you ever. Were you aware of Pepsi Spice? Isn't that knew my friend Brian single handedly might have nuked Pepsi Spice Back. Is it Pepsi fires now? Does he? Um. I wonder if Brian still has that website. He had a website. He bought Pepsi Spice Dot Com. It was fucking hilarious. It's one of his best roles like and he started writing about how he was on a diet of drinking only Pepsi spice and so and as time went on he started getting sicker and sicker and his diary and he talking about like shitting out blood and maybe I should go to the hospital and Pepsi Spices fucking freaking out and try to figure out like who is this guy?

Speaker 3:          00:45:25       How did he get Pepsi? [inaudible] DOT com. He bought Pepsi [inaudible] Dot Com. Like the moment it came out. Well two things. First of all, if you go read the reviews for sugar free gummy bears on Amazon, it's the whole. It's the similar. Same thing. Yeah. Yeah. I own cadbury, creme [inaudible] dot com and I guess I should do. I do. I should do something with it. Why don't, why don't you sell it to cadbury creme eggs while we give you a million bucks. They got my email, they holler at mic is right here, and I also will throw in fucktard's dot org for free. Whew. That's worth trying to hide it. Pepsi is, if you Google it, it will expire at some vending machine. Oh, they're trying to spice instead. It's autocorrecting for you incorrectly. See that did the second thing. There you go. Brian redbands. Pepsin spice challenge. Hoax is one of the funniest things. Ign. Go Click on that. On Iga. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:46:20       Holidays. And he did this and I want to say he did this in like 2004 is when I came here. That's what I was going to say. It was one of his best trolls ever. Beautiful. Yeah, he came for days too. He kept updating still there? Yes. Still Drinking Pepsi. Spiced.blogspot.com. Oh, that's amazing. And it's 2004. Yeah. My friend, uh, he, he gave me the idea for this book just an ass. She invented Bacon is Bacon, salt, all these bacon products. And taco bell had a line of like Tacos with Bacon in. It was like a special promotion. So he made a Taco out of Bacon, the shell was baking like a week and he goes, you're a Taco bell corporate meeting because this is on their big launch and they're just like a thank you for your appreciation of. They can't be like that. You're not the devil.

Speaker 3:          00:47:11       That's crazy though. How were they getting all that bacon? That's what you really want to see this fucking warehouse full of tortured pit. Um, I don't know. We got way off track here yet, but what we're saying essentially before we got onto this crazy rant is that we need an updated form of government, you know, and we needed an updated form of government with qualified people. Neil degrasse Tyson had an amazing tweet the other day I think is really important. He was talking about members of Congress, I believe it was. And he was saying, look at all these people in government and what are their occupations? Lawyer, lawyer, lawyer, lawyer. He's like, where the engineers were. The scientists were the math petition. That's a, that's a dangerous road because the rest of life communists said there were scientific, scientific socialism and those engineers are the ones who regard human beings as factors to be thrown into equation and that's when you get the meat grinder.

Speaker 3:          00:48:00       Jesus Christ. So you. St Sciences, Philip Meat Grinders. I was saying when scientists try to become politicians, they start, stop looking at human beings as human beings and start looking at them as factors in the machine. Yeah, it's very sick. Have you been paying attention to what's going on with Bill Nye? Scientists are all going after bill. Neither Mr Guy the Weimer. Yeah. What's. Why? Why are Germany is right before Hitler was El decadent and like everyone's just completely loose and cultural liberal and he's having these dancers about talking about their vagina. It's why motor. That was what was ridiculous. Not even a scientist. No, he's not. Yeah, it tastes. He's a con man. Isn't he an engineer? Yeah, but he's not a climatologist. He's not a scientist and he's also changing his tune. There was A. Steven crowder did a bit about it where he showed the original show that he did many years ago where they talked about how gender is from chromosomes, there's double x, which is men and or women in x, y, which was men and they are establishing like what causes your gender?

Speaker 3:          00:48:58       Right, and now he's completely gone off of that and his new thing had this woman who belonged in some fucking Venice theater group, like barking out at a poetry slam, some unbelievably God awful song and this motherfucker put it on Netflix and a science show about gender and he pretended to be like a, a Dj in the background. Like this is so not science, right? It's not scientific consulting. Progressivism is just Christianity without the mythology. So it's. It's very much this kind of Christian ideal, radical progressive as correct. Which evangelical progressive is specifically. I don't mean someone who like believes in welfare. I mean there's this ideology that he's fallen into. What's a complete religion which has completely divorced from reality and stuff like this. It's full left wing. I mean, I think there's. There's great ideas and being progressive, there's some amazing ideas in terms of inclusiveness, in terms of live and let live, letting people be whoever they want, express yourselves in any way that you can see fit as long as it's not hurting others, but that stuff is aggressively propaganda.

Speaker 3:          00:50:00       It's meant to be propaganda. What is it? His show? His show is. Yes. I think what he's doing is licking his finger, finding out which way the wind is blowing and giving into those people. Now. I think he's a true believer because you have to be a true believer to put something like that out under your name and think this is a good idea. It's just a quick. It's like Christian rock. I think it's debatable. I honestly think that these people, especially a guy like him who was experiencing life in the public eye fairly late in life, right? And you know, and he, when he, when it comes to people that are really enthusiastic about science and really enthusiastic about these ideas that he's trying to push on the show other than this gender thing you're dealing with, uh, the great majority of them are liberal white majority and I'm sure he encounters a tremendous amount of pressure to be inclusive.

Speaker 3:          00:50:48       And gender is the hot topic when it comes to like weird science as it were. Like trying to figure out like how much of this is what people feel. How much of this can be explained in genetics? How much of this can be explained with sociology, how much of it is nature, how much of it is nurture, right? It's a very complex stew of human beings and we know for a fact that people very broadly, yes, we have a, there's a wide spectrum of human behavior and likes and needs and feelings and, and all sorts of weird dysmorphia is right. We don't know why people behave the way they behave. So for him to like boil it down to like one of the shittiest rap songs the world has ever known. Right. It's an insult. But I think that's my point is that I think you have to kind of drank the Koolaid to be putting this out as your product.

Speaker 3:          00:51:35       Um, I, maybe I'm less cynical than you. I don't know. That could be it. I feel like he's had been influenced by real. Well, I think the people that are super progressive are far more likely to push these ideas in a very enthusiastic way than people who are more conservative in these matters. They're not going to even approach them about this. Right. You know, so I feel like he's just been influenced by the influencers. Well certainly is getting rewarded for it. And once you get rewarded for something, your brain gets a feedback loop and it's trying to. It's kind of self validating. So that could be it. I can't speak. Here's the, here's the challenge. I always have two people who always talked about climate change. If you can't name two types of clouds and what they look like, you don't know enough about science and climate to open your mouth and that's him and he's probably an exception.

Speaker 3:          00:52:19       He probably knows about clouds, but I'm saying the average person who reads the New Yorker and they will tell you, every scientist agrees that climate change. You don't know the names of one scientist who advised on climate change. So shut the fuck up. It's a mantra. It's a mantra that people say, well, this is, uh, the, the, the scientists degree. Go for it. Yeah. I'm not disagreeing with it at all, but I am agreeing with what you're saying. I totally disagree with it because the site with climate change, uh, with this, with this, uh, perception of climate change, because if we had immediate or coming toward the earth, that is going to destroy a life. We're not going to be sitting here talking about North Korea. We're talking about, hey, what about the media? Or are they doing something with this fucking media or the climate change supposedly is going to decimate all civilization within a hundred years.

Speaker 3:          00:53:00       Why are we talking about healthcare? Why are we talking about China and trump spelling and his name? No. All you're going to be talking about is the government's going to shut down until we have an answer to this and every politician who has children and grandchildren is going to be like, we gotta fucking get together and solve this problem and the fact that this isn't happening is telling me that there's more to the story than we're being led to believe. How so? Because the fact that we're talking about other things. If this is really this imminent existential crisis, how are we talking

Speaker 1:          00:53:26       about anything else ever because it's imminent in terms of maybe 50 years that people are 49, how am I gonna I'm not even going to be here in 50 years was fuck you want to say thank you to the media or is it gonna hit America and the world. In 50 years we wouldn't be doing everything possible immediately to stop it. I think there are plenty of people that would just do coke and fly jets. I'm not necessarily sure they test all of their energy to save people that not even gonna be around to watch. Sure. But I think there's certainly 90 percent of people in Congress, uh, 90 percent of people in industry care enough about their children that this would be the only issue ever. Yes. If they felt like it was absolutely missing and eminent, I don't think they do. I feel like yours is so far away.

Speaker 1:          00:54:07       You can't feel it. I don't think that's true. I think for, especially when you get older, when you get older, you start thinking longterm. Why is trump backed away? He accent because he's trump is one data point and he's a living. I know, but there's a lot of those lunatics with tremendous amount of resources that aren't thinking about the future. He's rolling back the EPA regulations. He's trying to fucking frack everywhere. What he's doing is he's like, he's the guy who was doing coke and flying the jet wire, but look how much opposition there is to him. Right? So the point is, if this was a real thing, there wouldn't be opposition. It would be complete unanimous. Unanimity, well there's a lot of opposition because he is air quotes the one percent, which means 99 percent are going to be opposed to the behavior of this one person who's got billions of dollars and also has the power to do all this crazy shit like roll back the EPA regulations like somehow or another this fucking lunatic got into control of Environmental Protection Agency regulations.

Speaker 1:          00:54:59       I mean it's pretty fucking bizarre. So that's why this guy is not doing anything. He's. He is the radical thing that we're worried about. But as you said earlier, I think he's a good thing and that he's exposing how bizarrely flawed the system is that we are trying to patch up window 17, 76, right? I mean that's really what we're doing. Seventy, 89, 70, 76. We had the artists have federation. 17. 80 nine was the formation of the United States. Does the constitution. Why do we always celebrate spirit of 76? Because that's the American war. So we were doing independent station. Yeah, their commission. Yeah. As far as I'm concerned, that's it. That's when it starts. 80 nine is when the United States was officially found. Was was the. Yeah, but here's the thing. If the constitution was illegal, you know, they went in, in the secret couple of people have talked about the founding fathers.

Speaker 1:          00:55:41       They went into Philadelphia secretly. They said, you're not allowed to throw out there. I was at confederation. They look at each other. Go with throwing the shit in the garbage, right? That. Oh yeah, yeah. Sworn to secrecy, which they did not have the power to do. Martin Luther went out and told everyone goes, oh, this is a coo. And it was. It was illegal and everyone's still champions them like there, this was all this great, great thing. This was a complete crew and all that saying that's a bad thing, but it was a cool in terms of like. So who was in control back then? You mean? England? Between England and the constitution with the articles of confederation. So the founding fathers in that convention had the ability legally to edit the articles of confederation. The first thing that they were like, yeah, fuck this thing. We were totally throwing out the window despite our mandate and and we're supporting each other to secrecy. Oh Wow. That's fascinating. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:56:24       Well, that's what we need. Well, I need that today. I need someone to fucking go. This is ridiculous. We're going to throw this whole thing. I think that was the big percentage of the trump vote was this shit's ridiculous. Yes, I think you're right. But now it's even more ridiculous, which is weird. Well, first of all, a lot of people who were into the idea that America is going to look after America and that we're all this foreign interventionalism, which is interrupting our lives and becoming a huge problem. And then what does he do? Bomb Syria, drops them all APP bomb. It starts. He's over in Saudi Arabia right now holding onto a big glowing ball with some dude is dressed like a wizard about Saudi Arabia and the Moab. Who'd you hear it from? A Jim Norton. Now I don't remember who I want to say. Alex Jones for comedic purposes.

Speaker 3:          00:57:11       Um, those were two moves to show North Korea that he's not joking because the Syria thing went against everything. He was saying, the whole campaign, Afghanistan, where the fuck that come from, and then the next week they're all saying we're not messing around with you. North Korea at the time for talk is over. So that's one theory. I heard that the moab bomb was just to show that they're capable of dropping that and that they're willing to drop it dropped in the middle of nowhere. I think about it. If you're going to show, do a show of force when you just throw it in Afghanistan rather than in Pyongyang. Yeah. That is the move. I guess. It's so fascinating to me that we have nukes and we'd like to ask too much. We're just get drop the biggest conventional bond known to man won't drop any nukes, so that's fine. We're cool.

Speaker 3:          00:57:54       We're cool. We're cool. We're cool with that. Like if he just decided that would be really fucked up if he just decided to drop a nuke on isis. If he knew that there was this place where Isis is, isis is 50,000 of 'em all concentrated in this one area and we just saw this fucking mushroom cloud like that one mushroom. I mean there's this classic ones from the 19 fifties when they did those nuclear autodesk, but if we saw one of those in the news over and full color. Oh yeah. Oh my God. From every angle. You have the camera phones. People from the space station filming the fucking. Yeah. You could probably see that from space. Oh yeah, for sure. Fuck. Yeah. And you can see the wall of China. You can see that. I think that's a myth, isn't it? Think it isn't matter.

Speaker 3:          00:58:40       Yeah. Unfortunately I think you can see it from certain satellites. Right? You can't see a different. It's like how high do you get up to 400 miles probably, but not like the Hemi v eight. Yeah. It's 22,000 miles away. Detail about that one now. Yeah, he did it right. He did a c space that either from a jet. Um, I wonder like what it would take for trump to want to drop a nuke in like a select location because I feel like there's ever a president that'd be willing to drop a nuke in the right spot. He'd be the guy. You don't think they put a bullet in him first.

Speaker 3:          00:59:16       I don't see enough resistance to him currently. You don't know who's around him though? The secret service or if he's going to nuke Russia, I can see them being like executive decision. I'm shooting this guy. Damn, that would be the end of their life though. Some of them not necessarily. It was someone shot at the president because he was about to drop a nuke guarantee. You someone will shoot the guy who shot the president. I, unless there's some kind of protocol in place that if this guy goes completely nuts, what do we do then? You know what's really fucked me up, man? I'm house of cards. Oh yeah. I watched that show. The same thing from a comedic perspective. Oh, the new season's coming out like next week. Yeah, just a masterpiece. Just finished. We, me and the missus binge watched the entire series and three fourths, four seasons, right? The course of a couple months. Oh Wow. Fucking awesome. If you haven't seen it, ladies and gentlemen, it's a masterpiece. It's maybe one of the best shows ever on television and it gets. It starts out you like. It was pretty good and then it gets deeper and deeper and crazier and crazier and there's never what I call a cut the shit scene like in every show in season three when she's in Russia and she feels bad for the gay kid. That's a cut. The Shit. This woman is a sociopath.

Speaker 3:          01:00:25       She's not losing control and power just to some gay rushed and she met the dude who hangs himself. Spoiler alert. I don't know. I felt like that was as much political as it was anything else, but they showed her really caring. You know, I got to know these people are murderers perhaps you're a bit cynical. Little on me. Pretty bad. And the Steve Irwin Boomerang hard. The late Steve Irwin. Is he a boomerang thrower? I thought it was just like wrestling crocodiles and showed us how to do that shit. I'd probably got less. Everybody knows how to write. Yeah, just chuck them. I mean, is there a technique to throw a boomerang? Oh yeah, of course. Right? Yeah. Because they had. It was weapons to knock things out. What was the idea was that you would throw it and then it would kind of come back at you if you missed.

Speaker 3:          01:01:11       Right, but which is funny because if you actually have good aim, it's not coming back because it's trajectories. Complete change, but you're knocking things out of trees or knocking birds out. I mean the great way to get a bee hive off a tree. Oh, is that what they use them for? Right. I'm guessing. I don't fucking know. It kind of makes sense. Right? What? It's kind of an ingenious device. When you think about what a boomerang. You remember when you were a kid the first time you saw one or played with and you're like, oh my God, this is magic. I maybe only played with one once or twice in my whole life when I was a kid I had one and I couldn't get it to work, but I got to the kind of work and I'm like, this is the. This is the future.

Speaker 3:          01:01:42       This is a gay for his book. This is all due respect to my gay friends at the MSI friends. I'm like, this is just to make any sense. I don't get what you're doing here. I don't have any. It's. It was like a weapon when it wasn't for war though, right? Was for hunting? Yeah, I think so. It's like, don't you guys know about the bone marrow? We'll hook you guys up. Lack of birds over in Australia. They didn't have enough feathers and like what do we do with these sticks? But what about the Kookaburra lot of that. The Kookaburra Kookaburra. It's their big bird. That's always laughing Baja about moves, right? Don't they have feathers? Are you most at as one of them is in Australia. There's the ostrich. The email in the Ria. I guess the Amazon Australia have huge feathers. Yeah. You feel like it could be trimmed down for flushings?

Speaker 3:          01:02:30       Oh yeah. I didn't know any better. Did you see that recent thing where they said that the most, uh, the, they found that the earliest Australians, the earliest indigenous people landed in Australia 50,000 years ago, which is fucking incredible. Oh yeah. Like how the hell they get their 50,000 years ago. Well, I mean, didn't they? I didn't. Same thing with like Siberia and the Bering Strait. Right. Getting to America as the question, was there some sort of a landmass that connected them to somewhere else 50,000 years ago? I mean, they're essentially an isolated continent. Right? Right. Nothing's close unless you have those archipelagos something New Zealand and Papua New Guinea. Well, those people, especially, especially the South Pacific people were incredibly daring in their journeys out to see thousands and thousands of years ago. We dug out canoes and these boats that they would construct and they would just fucking get out in the ocean.

Speaker 3:          01:03:17       Like, let's see what happens. They must have been having really bad marriages to be getting this belt. Bitch. I'm going west. I don't care if there's land, I'm not staying here with you. Yeah. What? What makes a person get into a boat thousands of years ago and looking out into the ocean. Go, I'm going to take a chance. And the funny thing is we think that they're brave, but maybe they just really dumb and like a bad directions. Right? Who knows? Who knows what causes someone to want to do. And then you get to a continent and you're like, what the fuck do I do now? I guess this is my house now. Well, how about what they did with Hawaii? I mean they essentially found a fucking volcano. Just got lucky. Yeah. Yeah. Volcano popping out of the middle of the ocean. Yeah. We lucked out that we fly.

Speaker 3:          01:03:57       Fuck yeah, they did. And then there's the people that don't look at so much. Very few bugs. No predators. Like, dude, I thought that's huge bugs. It's not. I don't think so. They don't have snakes. I know that they don't have snakes. I mean maybe they have some bugs, but you rarely see legs. Maybe these spiders and shit. The problem with Australia, excuse me, the problem with Hawaii is it a lot of the stuff that they have over there came from somewhere else, tremendous amount of things like birds and they were stowaways on boats and shit. Spam, spam pigs, pigs in general, like a little wild pigs and deer, all these weird dear access deer from Asia. They just recently had to save the giant parrot, the Kakapo in a near Australia because they were like 100 left because the Ra, because they had no defenses.

Speaker 3:          01:04:40       They can't fly and the rats are eating of all. So they found, they found all of them, moved them to a different island, killed the rats and brought her back and now they're being saved. Oh Wow. They're really cool. Well, they've had a bunch of crazy experiments in Australia with toads, toads, and then with bringing in cats and they have feral cats and they kill all the ground nesting birds and foxes to kill the cats and cats like nasty. Like they. All they do is kill birds and like rodents in small animals and we think because they're cute and you've played with their belly, but they are killing machines. Well, they're cute. If you raise them, you have them at home and you domesticate them and give them nothing about cat food and pet them all the time and they purr and they don't have any desire to go out there and.

Speaker 3:          01:05:18       And eat and rape. Yeah. All cat sex is rape. Well, this way you look at it. Will they have barb Dicks, right? Yeah. They steal her up and then if you. If the male cat sees a female with the litter, he kills the litter so she'll get a population. Again. That's super common in the animal world, unfortunately. Yeah, and the bear world, it's even worse. They eat them too. They really. Bears are almost 100 percent cannibals. Oh Wow. Yeah. The the male bears eat all the cubs. It's like the best way. It's. It's so counterintuitive, but the best way to ensure a healthy population of bears is to kill a male's. Wow. Yeah. You have to kill the old bores. You go the like, that's one of the reasons why they actually encourage, especially with black bears, black bear hunting is encouraged, is also really important because one of the main things that they eat is Fonz, like if you want to have healthy moose populations in deer populations, but yeah, I was there in Alberta when a friend of mine actually saw a bear kill a cub and chase the mother way killed the cub and then the mother came back and finished the cub off.

Speaker 3:          01:06:28       She hated herself. It's a dark world in the woods. You think North Korea is rough being a fucking bear? Well, my, my I, I might, I. my first job was writing for an aquarium magazines. I've been obsessed with animals since I was a kid. Aquariums. That was my thing back in the day. Oh Man. I always wanted to have a massive saltwater fish tank. The best thing ever. And I had all these secrets and shit. Oh No, no. I had the kind of fish I had wrote my friend called God's mistakes because they all look like monsters. So that's the kind of shit. What did you have like a, there's something called a big guy. Uh, there's something called a cal fish, which can't, it's encased in armor and can't move, um, and a soap fish which releases a cloud of poisoned when it's upset. And an Angler fish, which also doesn't move at a slipper.

Speaker 3:          01:07:15       I may pull up these things there. They all look like aliens. So it was really kind of fun. Yeah. It's just electric catfish that you had an electric shock. You, you in your balls. Well, I touched on electric eel. We were on food fish. Yes I do. If you touch an electric eel, you're going to get fucked up. Those things are no joke. No, they're not that bad. It can kill you. How long? How big was it? That was big enough for me to grab. I mean, we, we did it on fear factor was one of the stones. But you had to do it in one hand. You can't do with both hands. We also go through your heart, remember? Yes. I remember this fear factor. If something like, Holy Shit, where'd they get these electric eels for them? And the thing is they had to do with one hand or else it makes a circuit if you use them both hands.

Speaker 3:          01:07:53       Maybe. I don't remember the slipper lobster, but what I do remember is it sucked. Like I definitely grabbed it and was like, yeah, yeah. It's no joke. It's amazing that a small animal can give you such a charge like that. And it does it with its body. The whole, the anus is right by the mountain. So the whole thing is electricity. Yeah. Isn't that cool? That's why it's electric mouth was right by the asshole. It's all fucking confused you to notice that it's crazy. Look. And what is that called? A slipper. Lobster slipper. Have lobster tail. It's often this face of that thing. That's insane. So instead of clause, they have faced flaps. The two hinges. Whites. Yeah. If you look at the top, do you see that one hinge and another? Yeah, that's one of the hinges goes up and down the other goes left and right.

Speaker 3:          01:08:32       And all my guts. So it's like the Predator. Yeah, it's really cool. Do they have one with his mouth open? Uh, the mass underneath maybe meaning we're where it's exposed, where it's like grabbing something. You'd have to be. No, so you won't see it because it wouldn't, I would feed it, it would grab it and put it near with the belly. Oh Wow. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And pull up a p, R I s t e g e n y s I didn't know until like two years ago what cuddle fish and octopus could do. My friend remy, he used to have this show called Apex Predator where he would study these predators and try to figure out like what strategies do you use for catching their prey? And one of the things that he studied was a octopus and he came on Octopi and he was like, dude, they're from another planet.

Speaker 3:          01:09:15       Their smartest cats. The other very smart, very smart, super smart. And they can not just change the way they look, but change their texture. Right. And they fit in perfectly with our environment. Yes. He showed us some videos and I'm like, how am I 48 years old and not knowing about this. They were absolutely. And the ones at the bottom to see even crazier. Then you have the zebra octopus, which is a mimic and the question you have a philosophy person is, is it consciously trying to look like something else or data devolve. Coincidentally it looked like because they, they look like flounders and then squids and then lion fish and mantis shrimp and like some of these forms wouldn't be advantageous. Like why would you want to look like a flounder? But it just changes from shape to shape just very quickly. Well not only that, like how does it know what the environment looks like to a point where it could change it, how does it know what it looks like?

Speaker 3:          01:09:59       It doesn't have a mirror. And that's the other thing. They put them on top of a checkerboard deceased. They can emit, imitate it and they like, they didn't know what to do. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well they can, they can imitate all sorts of different surfaces. Coral and all sorts of different crazy things. And it's. And what they'll do is they'll release their cloud of ink and then what move. But they'll just change shape. So it looks like they vanished like a super villain. Yeah. Yeah. Well they think that that's like the. There was one speculation that that blast of ink that they shoot out is almost like the like correction fluid, like white out. Like those are, that's not what I meant. Like oh wow. That they do it to each other, like to like to stop conversations and that part of what they're doing when they're changing their body is like a visual form of communication that will.

Speaker 3:          01:10:39       They definitely do like the, like chameleons. Also. Communities don't always change color for evolution. They'll do it for protection. They'll become red show anger and its mood. Like a lot of fish. I've had changed color based on mood to communicate. It's fascinating. Mood fish like mood rings, better mood rings. Well it's good because some fish when they are the water's dirty, they'll be a different color. So you'll know it's time for water change. The catfish did that. Oh, when they look sick, you know, they just get darker. Oh just not good. It's just dusky or it's like, all right, I need to make him lemonade colored again. Oh Wow. Yeah. I thought that when they put an octopus on checkerboard that did

Speaker 1:          01:11:14       mimic the checkerboard, it couldn't figure it couldn't get it right. Can you find that? That was confusing to me. They did. There was something similar to that. Maybe some sort of a striped pattern that it mimicked the strife steak I think they can do, but the checker boards the problem, if I remember correctly. So what are the best one is the flamboyant cuttlefish. They just discovered it's two inches long walks, but it's colored like a, like a. it's like an acid trip and they're just fascinating. Look, flamboyant. That's the official name. Flamboyant cuttlefish. Isn't it true that they've only, they've only researched like 10 percent of the ocean floor. Oh yeah. It's insane. That's, I mean that's my friend came up with the name God's mistakes because God made some fish. He's like, well no one's gonna. See that. They're just throwing the in the ocean because they all look like monsters.

Speaker 1:          01:11:54       And I. my theory is because there's no light down there that things like visuals which are based on mathematics don't apply, so it's okay that they're hideous because no one's going to be seeing them. What about bioluminescent fish and phosphorescent ones? Yeah. There's weird ones that they create their own light bulbs. They all have. They almost all have them. There's one which uses red light because others can't see red and they use them like search lights. Oh yeah. There's so much crazy shit. The bottom of the sea. It's so fascinating. I mean, if we found what's really fascinating to me is if we found any of this stuff in space, we'd be freaking out. This is why I never could like star trek because it drove me crazy as an autistic young boy are you autistic, but for this purpose I am that I would know all these zoological animals that look like insane things.

Speaker 1:          01:12:40       Walking back fish, which you can't swim, and then I turned on Star Trek. It's another planet and it's a guy with fucking blue skin and like I can get blue skin. Show me something that's not based on the human form. You fucking ass each all the job is. Here's the octopus cuttlefish, cuttlefish octopus, Java. The Hudson was what blew my mind as a kid because they look like aliens. Well, my favorite one was that stupid lizard guy that Captain Kirk had a fight with. Oh God, I remember that one. I never watched star trek for this reason. I'm not even joking. It's so bad. Okay, so here's the cuttlefish. He's on the ground and there's a like a sandy bottom, and he kind of looks like the sandy bottom and then they put this at the beginning. It took it off so could switch back. The Best I did was that little block.

Speaker 1:          01:13:23       Wow. That's pretty impressive. If we fucking close, you did its best, but how did it know? The eyes are on the side, so they're looking at an old directions at once, like a rabbit or. But as a no, to make a square. Right? What the fuck? Look what it's doing it right there. It's kind of Holy Shit. That's creepy. Wow. Jesus Christ. Look a flamboyant cuttlefish. You got to see this shit. It's toxic as hell to these animals. I mean, what caused them to evolve like this and they've been around forever. Forever and they also have very short lifespans. Yeah. So it's not even working. What keeps you alive? How long week look like, God, this is insane. Holy Shit. I'm tripping. And those always are it. It's not the. It's not the water. It's making it look like there's a wave of skin.

Speaker 3:          01:14:12       Wow. Look at us eyes too, right? Because they're the first ones. They found that walk. It looks like a tiny water. Hippo is that lady. She's cute and she just wants to know. She's cute. Look at that thing. My God. Amazing. That is amazing. And I think that's hypnotic. It's meant to be hypnotic. Lucky break up. Oh, look at that. Oh yeah, yeah. You look at it and it shoots this fucking alien thing like the Ridley Scott Alien. Find them out the second time now and jabs at fish fuckin a man. Like if we found that on Jupiter or rice or something like we'll be freaking out. It's two inches. You're like, what the fuck is this shit? Yeah. I mean, if this was anywhere, if they found this, you know, pick a pick a planet in our solar system, we would be so obsessed with it.

Speaker 3:          01:15:00       But the fact that it's in the ocean, like, yeah, it's right over there. Who gives a fuck? I just found it pretty recently to really. Yeah. I think in the nineties there was a website that was dedicated to a bunch of animals that were uncovered during one of the tsunamis. I think it was the big tsunami that hit. Was it Vietnam or Thailand? Oh, was it somewhere? Yeah, but there was a, I think now that I'm saying is I feel like it was debunked. Like someone said, no, that's not where they came from, but it was a series of super bizarre animals that were found super bizarre fish they found at the bottom of the ocean that literally looked like they came from another world. Look up. There's something called a uh, um, mouse trap fish where it's now, it's like a mouse trap. It's hinged and it, it, it works like a mouse trap.

Speaker 3:          01:15:51       Well, how about the anglerfish? He's got a fishing pole hanging off his fucking head. Well, I had. There's a bunch of different kinds of angler fishes and the best, there's one called the clown angler fish, which has warts all over it and they're very brightly colored. And this they to do Jamie. This one, I'm sorry. We're almost asking them too many things to google. Just one thing. This is the one they'll blow your fucking mind. The football fish. And what's amazing about them is the females are like a yard, but the males are two inches long and the males attached the females and lose their sense of identity becomes sperm glands. Oh look, regular dudes. That's amazing. Yeah. So they, they couldn't figure out where the males were for a long time. The female said just these growths on them. And they were male. They were the males Angler anglerfish.

Speaker 3:          01:16:32       Well crazy. The football fish. And I typed it in. So, but, but he's tricking backwards with that photograph, but there's one with the dangle it dangles if that's as a female. So she dangles it in. Yeah. That's looked at that they dangled over there. And then the other, Hey, what's going on over here? And inhale. Some definitely you just missed the teeth on that fucking thing. And some of them have outside the mouth. Those are the OBC anglers. Go back to Jamie, the name that's the family Holo fry, California Day. That's the family, the family of Angler fish. And there's a bunch of families to them. Wow. Look at that thing. God, there's so many of them. How many Angler fish are there? Look at the one that tank show that one, that one, that one. They have one in display. Look at that. Hold our creep. Yeah. I mean that doesn't even look like a real thing. Right? Wow. It's an amazing look at that one. That one's bio luminescence? Yeah. You could see where the spots are. Ah, that's beautiful. Yeah. And they can't keep them in a cramped. What is that called? It's also anti football fish. Go back, go back to. So what do you get add over there? Uh, Atlantic.

Speaker 3:          01:17:41       Look at that thing. Oh yeah. The colors in that thing. And it looks like it's bolted together. Oh yeah. It looks like patchwork. Like some sort of an animated movie there. There's the deep sea is my favorite kind of stuff with all this crazy shit. But what's the most underappreciated and overlooked? Go to that one. That's up right above that, Jamie. The one. Yeah, right there. What does that one? Yeah, they're all. Do you want to see something real thing, man, that's, that does not look real. Yeah. God, these things are amazing. Look up, um, red lipped walking batfish fish because there's one that's a relative of this. There wears lipstick. Walking, walking back fish. Wow. Why in the fuck is that thing? They can't swim. So they. Yeah, they have a nose and out of the nose is where the angle comes from. That's my favorite fish.

Speaker 3:          01:18:34       Look at that shit. Oh my God. Look at the lips. Yeah. Wow. Isn't that amazing? Yeah. They're like, they're very hard to keep in captivity to species because they always have parasites. Oh, is that why? Yeah. Why can't they keep great whites in captivity? Because a great whites are extremely sensitive to electric impulses in the water, so they keep banging their heads against the wall, plus their pelagic, which means they live in the ocean where there's nothing around them, so they're not used to any barriers, so this really fucks them up. They need to be able to go full speed for miles at a time. Oh Wow. Yeah, that's interesting. They got a whale sharks in captivity that Georgia, and they've got three in Georgia and Atlanta. How big is the tank? It's Jack gets the biggest tank in the world, or second biggest. Yeah, the glass was like two feet thick, so the crazy.

Speaker 3:          01:19:20       So it seems stupid to keep them go, go see them in the ocean, man, Philippines for them. The Great. Then watch them on video just seems fucked up to me. To keep those things in captivity just doesn't make any sense. They're there. Yeah, I guess. Yeah. Awesome. Great. If you could talk to them, you know, probably be like prisoners, like super bummed out. It's just like North Korea, but for fish. Well, I used to have a joke about that, about like someone like saying like, hey man, you know, things that bad. I went to the zoo, I saw these chimps playing with a rope and they look, they're having a good time. I go, yeah, go to prison. You Watch dudes playing basketball. Doesn't mean it's awesome. Right, right. Especially with the higher end in prison that are intelligent. Yeah. Yeah. It's like if people have pets were birds.

Speaker 3:          01:20:02       I don't. I'm a big pet person, but the bird wants to be flying around. Yeah. Like when they clip their wings. Now you don't need these. Yeah. I needed to keep you around. Yeah. The only thing that makes you special and I want to say hello. Let me clip your wings. Yeah, it is. I don't know, we're weird. We're weird with our dominance over other animals, but I mean I guess every animal that has control over their animals is weird. Like if you've seen that thing about dolphins, they take puffer fish and they get high with them, they pass them around. What? I killer whales, they kill babies for fun. Oh yeah. They have a good time. They're sick. Well yeah. It will. Dolphins do the exact same thing that you were talking about. The cats do where they kill off the, the young to make the female breed because a female dolphin won't go into breeding.

Speaker 3:          01:20:44       I think it's like six or seven years while she was raising the kid. Okay. Yeah. So one of the things that females do to mitigate this is they fuck as many males as they can because they obviously they don't have Maury Povich and DNA tests and the ocean. So they fuck is. They're like extremely promiscuous. And the idea behind it, if they fuck enough of these males, the guy will have no idea whose baby is so think it's his baby fuck to you. That might be my kid. All right. I'm not going to eat them. My knowledge if the C is just limited to fish. So let's get some novelists. I'm looking, I've kind of like c student, but you're a Dork, like you really love it. I'm a Dork. Uh, all different kinds of species. I can rattle off things all day, like every. What do you think about the Tasmanian Tiger?

Speaker 3:          01:21:27       Do you think that things alive that day? They're thinking of trying to clone it back because they have ones in Formaldehyde, do they? Yeah. So it died out in the twenties, I believe. Uh, I think it's somewhere around there and because we have video of it, yes. One in captivity and they are thinking of trying to clone it and bring it back. I didn't know that. There it is right there. What a great is fabulous. It's the only animal that can open. It's not like 120 degrees or something. Well, they think that they might have a few of them still in the wild because Australia is essentially the size of the contiguous United States, but with the same amount of people in Los Angeles and they think that it might be possible because there's been several sightings at these things, but then you gotta think there's several sightings and bigfoot.

Speaker 3:          01:22:05       I love cryptozoology. It's. It's just absolutely fascinating because even the coloration looks like they'll copy which is the giraffes closest relative and they thought that was fake and then they found one another in zoos. You could see it's a crazy looking at them. Yeah, but do you think that that thing is. I mean there's enough sightings where they're starting to actively consider. There was a a movie with what the Fuck Willem defoe several years ago where someone had hired him to go and shoot a Tasmanian Tiger that they knew were one was and that somebody wanted it to stuff at or something like that. There was this species of insect on St Helena Island, I think it was where they thought it was extinct or they found a bush. There had 13 of them and now they bred them and there's like thousands, so if they found one it would be great because they'd be able to breed them to huge numbers pretty quickly. Also, it's like one of the last predators other than like saltwater crocodiles, right? In Australia. Yeah, yeah, yeah. The dingoes no joke there. They've been taken out a lot of stuff. They have that whole dingo fence for that reason. Yeah. Yeah. Australia is a really weird place, man. Some of mine were just over there.

Speaker 2:          01:23:06       They were hunting water buffaloes. Oh, it was Asian water buffaloes. Huge, huge. And also an invasive species. So these things come over and they just destroy the water like anything else. That truck 2000 plus millions and they just shit everywhere and ruin all the water sources. So all these birds, all these different animals that need that water all getting fucked up and dying. Did you ever see one when it took out the lion? I did see something like that recently. Yeah. Yeah. Where there's like a Cape Buffalo. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. It's just the macy says kill. It just swings at end of the line, goes flying like 20 feet. Have you ever seen the documentary relentless enemies? No. It's fascinating. It's so good because it's about these lines that adapted to only eat water buffalo. What happened was they had a change in the current of the river, changed the course of a river and an isolated this one island of lions and they only had two things to eat and one of the things was Cape Buffalo, which are fucking enormous, so these lions became freakish mutan lions, enormous lions, like the average female is the size of an average male, La and everywhere else in Africa, but google relentless enemies, giant killer lions because the females don't even look real.

Speaker 2:          01:24:22       They look like hulk lions. They're fucking Jack. This is another reason I'm very skeptical about this climate change stuff because nature is far more adaptable than we give it credit for. Oh, you mean climate change in that? Like the doom and gloom. Like if the temperature is that one degree that the corals can't handle it. I don't buy it will move to Canada, Canada. I love it. I love Canada. I love Toronto, see if you get these. These are the ones going after it, but see if you can get an image of some of the lions from relentless enemies because they're just get. Just Google it. Go and look. Don't just keep popping these up on the screen because there's some of them. If you go and look and find it, you can find ones that are just jacked. That's relentless enemies. Yeah, but see if you can find like a good image of the lives right next to it.

Speaker 2:          01:25:06       That one? Yeah, that one. No, it's not. They're good. There's some really good ones. There's some really good ones where they look freakish. There's a good look at the size of that fucker like that is so much bigger than the average female lion. That's crazy. It's because they're. All they're eating is east cape buffaloes. He's fucking enormous buffalo's so they've grown to like 600 pounds for the average female lion there are much bigger. Oh my God. Yeah. They're huge. They're. They look so huge that even look real and they still even this big. They have to gang up on him. Of course, jump on their back and one of them jumps on the leg and I mean it's just. But the documentary is amazing and interestingly enough, there's several prides of lion on this one island and then not all that big. It's just one pride is that big. The other prides are like fairly normal sized, but one pride has. It's just freakishly large species of lion. You know, I ran through a lot of scenarios, but what we're going to be talking today, and this was not one of them, I didn't went

Speaker 3:          01:26:03       through any scenarios. I mean I knew we were going to talk. We're sure about North Korea, but I didn't know. We're going to talk about giant lines or psychedelic cuddle fish. What's it called again? Flamboyant. Flamboyant cuttlefish. What a perfect name. Yeah. Yeah. Why do they always use these fucking Latin names? Because that way, and this happens with when you into aquariums, if I'm sending you something from England to America or England to Cambodia, you know, we're speaking the exact same species because what you might call a gray parrot is not the same as what I would call a great parent. That makes sense. That's interesting that he chose a dead language. Well, that way it's universal. Right? That makes sense. Why don't just use English since we kick ass? Because America speak American and world American. I'm sorry, those America. We've got a by England in this.

Speaker 3:          01:26:55       Just take over that. That name of the language. Keep calling it English like enough already. You guys wouldn't be it, right? You guys speak wrong and he spelled tires wrong too. I really think that they've evolved that accent to come off as smarter than they really are. I think Americans are smarter than British people and it's a big lie. That's rude. You're racist against who? The British? Yes are. They're all ugly. So. Oh, how dare you have not seen a sporty spice? She isn't she the hot one was the hot one. Boy, it's pretty hot. She's American and I decided the hot ones are American, but the thing is, it's when you hear British people talk, you think they're smart and you talk to them like you're not that fucking smart. You just stood accent Guy Ritchie's really fucking smart. Well, he's one data point. Madonna, you're trolling. I see what you're doing. Wait, wait. You wait. You read a lot of people from America and English. Do you think English people generally smarter than Americans? I think that people vary widely.

Speaker 3:          01:27:53       Okay, but you could still do a lot of really dumb American people. Of course, a lot of really dumb American beat, but I think there's a lot of really dumb British people. I'm sure. Yeah, I'm sure. I never met him. Everyone I met as a genius from England. Everyone, all of them. Oh fuck that guy. Ritchie and sporty spice. Sporty guy. Ritchie. Well, you haven't. Madonna, and she's a genius listener of Madonna's English now. Gave them. We gave her away. I mean the idea that you can with a straight face just put makeup, a British accent. You got to realize the kind of Dick that Guy Ritchie was slinging. He fucked her up so bad that she doesn't work anymore and she speaks English. She barely even saying that is. That is stigmatized if I've ever seen it. He's just laying that fucking lock stock and two smoking barrels. Are they. Are they. They're divorced though, right? Yeah, yeah. Yeah. But she's still fucked up from it. She was really fucked up. He's recovered greatly, but she's really like, really? She's a mess. She's got like those tweety birds for cartoons was the universal thing for somebody fucked up. Birds would circled it.

Speaker 3:          01:29:01       How did we know what they meant? Like someone got clocked over the head with a frying pan and we'd see those birds. Tweet, tweet, tweet, tweet, and where are you going to? Yeah. That got fucked up and I think she's got a mix of those birds and cuckoo clocks. Yeah. Well it's got to be hard, man. When you're like a sex symbol for women is like, there's this weird phase that women go through, which is very disturbing. Everyone except Christie Brinkley who had still. Fuck, sorry. Sorry. No disrespect, but she's like in her sixties, she's still hot, but every other woman who's like really hot, when she was in her twenties, they get to this certain age and either they let it go like Meryl Streep and just accept an age gracefully or they start shooting a bunch of shit in my face and they get real weird looking.

Speaker 3:          01:29:45       Right? Or they just become like a monster and so they go from being extremely desirable to repulsive the uncanny valley, the Uncanny Valley of deals with software, but it deals with like when robots look too close to human beings, it's repulsive, right? Artificial intelligence, what they use artificial. I'm a virtual reality. Right? But the point is someone has to look like a person, but not too much like a person who has this creepy. So they become like, you look human almost. Right. So then it becomes very repellent. Yeah, that's what's. That's what's tweaky about. We went to Nvidia a few years back when I was doing this Scifi show and this was, I want to say 2012 or 13 where they were just getting good at this virtual reality software and the reproduction of the human body, but they couldn't get eyelashes downright. Oh, like blinking. It was weird like that.

Speaker 3:          01:30:36       So you'd watched this guy, Tom, like there was something weird about the blinking, trying to give you a message and code. Fucking bizarre. Like wasn't there some Vietnam hostage? American POW. It's blinking. Sos. Oh yeah. What was that? I think that's what I think it was that POW two, three, one, two, three. Yeah. Yeah. They'd probably killed him. Yeah, they, I mean the Americans that the Koreans had hostage did similar shit and they got tortured be unbelief. While that was something I was reading about China, about how many CIA operatives in China had been killed over the last two years? Like 18. Is that. Oh my God. Yeah. 18 different informants had been killed or jailed over the last couple of years and they were complaining we can. We can't fucking spy on them anymore. It's like, hey, like they don't want you spying like to get it, but with the way we look at it, like we're allowed a spy. Like you can't be killing people. That is. Yeah. So they're interviewing him here. Can you hear it?

Speaker 4:          01:31:40       Oh my,

Speaker 3:          01:31:42       a I can't.

Speaker 4:          01:31:49       I believe in. I'm a member of that group.

Speaker 3:          01:31:53       Whoa. Yeah. Vietnam. There's something entirely terrifying about watching someone who is a prisoner of war. Oh yeah. So when John Mccain has these racist quotes, sometimes it's like, you know what? You get it pass. You can't even, you, you're fine. You can't lift your hands over your head. You're, you do whatever you say. Whatever you want. You've earned it. Yeah. He. How does he get dressed? Like is he can only do this. Yeah. Well that's because they broke his arm data. Yeah, like a shoulders. I think they pulled them and kind of had him hanging by his wrist. I believe if it's just an still have and you know, he can't tie his tie and all this stuff. It's like, you know, you can say you can use slurs. That's fine. You're saying it's okay. I think for him, you know, so it's just like, yeah, get them some stem cells.

Speaker 3:          01:32:35       Shit, my mom listen to this shit. My Mom, God bless her heart, started taking stem cells by which it was plant stems in a pill form. Oh Jesus. And I'm just like, I just, I you. What do you say to that? What did she think it was going to do to her? I mean, stem cells are good for your energy and also what you said, I don't even fucking know I at that point, you're just like, okay mom. Well they are, they are a loophole. Go, you're going to live forever. Wonder like if John Mccain's ever tried to do anything about his shoulders or if it's just like, fuck it. I'm sure he did. I mean I wonder this is decades at this point. He's a fascinating character. Yeah. He's a grumpy old dude and sometimes it makes a whole lot of sense and a lot of people will like totally down for him being president and all of a sudden he goes, Sarah Pailin running with them and you're like, what are you doing man?

Speaker 3:          01:33:25       I'm like, what the fuck is going on? That sort of unveiled the machinery behind the Republicans and like what? What do you think America is like? You think America is like some sort of weird reality show. Some honey booboo type shit or this lady is should be one heartbeat away from being the fucking president. When she came out, she had, when she was nominated, she had the highest approval rating of any governor in America and her first capitalist speeches. Everyone's like, oh yeah, this lady is a ball buster. And then interview hit and you're like, Holy Shit. She doesn't read. She's. She's. She's like had learning disabled. Yeah. Well I don't know if she's learned to say, but I just don't think she's interested in learning. I read her book and it was really interesting. Or You read her book. There's only so many hours in a day.

Speaker 3:          01:34:12       How many days in a week, so many years in your life that can read North Korean propaganda could read this and there's this one point in the book where I'm like, her ghost writer should be fired because she, her daughter, willow, whatever goes to her, mommy, why don't you ever cry? And I'm like, this is a murder mystery. That's how you know she's a sociopath and it's in the book. I'm like, Holy Shit, that's terrifying. Mommy's too dumb to cry. I don't think it's just, Mommy's just don't understand sadness. It's just skin over wires and circuitry. Oh Man. See, I didn't see that. I just saw her as being adored. Well, like it came out. I think there's, just like with George W Bush, you remember the first 2000, he won those debates against Gore, or at least held his own and then there was just declined to the point where he's not even speak English. Well, do you remember when George Bush was running for Governor of Texas? Now? I don't. I mean, I, I wouldn't have noticed that I'm from

Speaker 2:          01:34:58       New York. Well, um, the reason why I remember is because they show the stark contrast between his ability to communicate while he was running for governor versus his ability to communicate once it became president. I felt like he was almost like a guy who had all his responsibility taken away from him and he just like atrophied. Like Dick Cheney was kinda running the show and he was just sitting back fucking up lines and making mistakes with things. But if you watch the speeches that he gave, a kid will play this

Speaker 5:          01:35:30       a perspective. I think that the mission in education and literature, math, science and social science, it's still different to enrich beyond that, more power to them. But yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:35:41       Wow, that's a different person. We all know it gets better.

Speaker 5:          01:35:44       Four subject matters and see if we can do it right. We ought to determine the cost per pupil necessary to achieve excellence in the classroom. And we all to funded the funding priority of the state of Texas, the school children of our state. And it has not been under the past four years. The state share of education has decreased to 44 percent. That is why we have property taxes on the rise and nearly every single school district in

Speaker 2:          01:36:09       stable

Speaker 5:          01:36:10       defined the mission determine the cost per pupil necessarily.

Speaker 2:          01:36:14       You see reading from the teleprompter elected government. No, clearly not

Speaker 5:          01:36:16       say that the number one funding priority of our state will be the schoolchildren of Texas.

Speaker 2:          01:36:21       Holy Shit. Amazing and compare George Bush 10 years ago to George Bush today, now so that in the video it says this, listen to them now.

Speaker 5:          01:36:29       Awesome for dealing with nuclear proliferation, about 35 percent since I've been the president. Now. Secondly, we set up what's called the. Well first of all, I agree with it. My opponent that the biggest threat facing this country is there a weapons of mass destruction in the hands of a terrorist network.

Speaker 2:          01:36:50       Yeah, he was clear and concise, but he was also a younger man. You have to realize like, this is an older man. He's tired and the grind of being the president for four years was wearing on him so hard when he was running against Kerry there. I mean, he was just a beaten man and I just think that job is just unbelievably draining, like some sort of a psychic vampire just locks onto you and saps you of all your fucking Mitochondria. Well, he doesn't have an excuse because his dad was president, so he would have known what it's like maybe his dad was only president for four years now only. I mean, come on. That's not going to be a short four years. Yeah, and his dad was the head of the CIA for that. So his dad was maybe more deeply entrenched in the ideas of politics than he was.

Speaker 2:          01:37:31       And I met his uncle. I went to Gail with a friend of mine who was doing a masters t and that guy I was ready to go out, come out swinging. I thought it was going to be a troll. That guy charmed the fucking pants off me and I'm like, Holy Shit. I can see why these people are in power one on one. They are so charming, will win. Jeb was running for president, so I almost felt like he was thrown in the towel. I felt like he was like, I'm just going to go through the motions and fuck some of this up. Just like

Speaker 3:          01:37:56       Rick Perry when Rick Perry was like. And then there's something I forgot. Yeah, I remember that. What about, did you say Jeb Bush is tweet when he, when he, when he quit, he said, sorry mom. That was his tweet. Jabba tweeted this out. Yes. Wow. His mom's probably secretly happy. Well, she, she didn't want him to run Barbara. She said that publicly before he announced. Yeah, she's like, enough tooth and two is enough. Well, it's a monarchy. Yeah. What's also crazy to me, why would he want to do it at that? Right? Who the hell knows why does anybody want to do it? But he seemed to be like the least qualified of album. Will trump's the least qualified in the bushes? Oh yeah. Yeah. And as far as his ability to communicate, he was like the worst of it. No. So Jeb, in 1996, I think it was, he ran for reelection against this guy.

Speaker 3:          01:38:41       I forgot his name. Baylor bend something. And they were tied and then they had a debate and Jeb crushed him so bad that he ended up winning by double digits. The Guy who'd be generating in the primaries. It was bill mcbride, I think is his name. This was for Florida? Yeah, when he was reelected. Governor of Florida. So he was a beast again, back in the day. And then you have these debates and he's standing there, you know? I mean it was, it was hilarious too. I think he just didn't want to do it. The thing was like, I don't think fast. I don't think any of them have ever known what to do with a trump figure, especially who's leading them. And when the guy's been trump's on stage saying, this guy's a real sick guy. He said he was going to pull down his pants and moon everyone.

Speaker 3:          01:39:20       And Jeff's like, what do you say to that? Is that what trump says? Yes. And it will be really fascinating if Alec Baldwin ran against trump. You think he's gonna run? No, I don't. But it would be fascinating because there's a guy who not only did trump on Syrah live, but is more than capable of holding his own and that kind of a fist to cuff sort of a debate like if he, if it insults being thrown back and forth, and that kind of. I told us a great [inaudible] you remember when Alec Baldwin lost the Shit and the reporter and called him a fag and all this other stuff. Remember this. So Alec was that. But it wasn't that guy a popper off to fine. The point is he's taking pictures of his family. He's got emotionally worked up, he's got thin skin. And that's not in those, in those debates.

Speaker 3:          01:40:04       Trump knows how to swing. Right? But Alec Baldwin's never been in debate. The point is, if Alec Baldwin loses his shit, he's trying to present himself as the same of alternative to this lunatic. So if they're both saying they're both fucking lunatics, was baldwins advantage? Better looking. I'm not nearly as power hungry, not a billionaire oligarch type. Anyone thought trump was power hungry? That wasn't the knock against him. But they definitely thought it was money hungry. Well yeah, but like Ted Cruz came up as much more power hungry. I think that trump did well. The Ted Cruz was kind of sunk by those weird commercial out clips. We the outtakes where you got to see them Redo it. Oh yeah. I remember when he said it was my. It was my mother play prays for me for an hour everyday and she was like, his daughter wouldn't kiss him. Yeah. His daughter wouldn't kiss ever. There was awkward

Speaker 1:          01:40:54       hugs and they had a redo takes and it's like, whoa. My favorite thing during the primaries was ted Cruz's regardless, like the best debater in Washington. Right? Izzy? Yeah. They all respect him that he was like, it has this long debate history from what was it? Harvard or Yale or where he went to. And this guy could practice for 100 years with 100 different fake opponents. And in that time, no one would ever think of throwing at him. Your Dad Shot Jfk. What was that about? How about the Zodiac killer shit. He kept calling the Zodiac cat. That's the green frog approach. That's the green frog effect. Yes. It's wonderful trolls. I started calling Hillary America's mother-in-law and that caught on a bit and that's how you have to take down these people is not through their ideas, but just kind of take their strengths and turn them into weaknesses.

Speaker 1:          01:41:42       That's hilarious. I remember there was a real clear moment during the campaign were Ted Cruz had not yet stepped away, not, not, not, not yet resigned, but there was. He was at a speech and somehow or another some trump supporter was in the front row wearing sunglasses, telling them to quit and calling them lying Ted and saying, you've already lost. When are you going to quit? And he was trying to engage. This guy was outside and I was like, oh, this guy's fucked up. He doesn't know how to deal with like a real person. What about when he had fear? Rena as his running mate and she follows up the stage at their announcement. It was like this curb your enthusiasm moment. It was amazing. How is this ever going to turn it around? Like what? What do you anticipate happening? My whole 2020, my hope is that the gears of government are going to be increasingly shut down, that political communication becomes impossible and we start breaking this stuff apart.

Speaker 1:          01:42:34       That's my goal. But don't you? Don't you think it will take like forever to come up with some new sort of structure to run this? I don't think we need to angled con. I don't think we need a structure. I think a lot of the structures in place that most of the interaction you have between humans is already there with structure. We didn't have any structure here for me to get here, right? So I don't think we're gonna need much replacing. Right? But, but there's no way that the people that are in the positions of power right now, whether there'll be senators, republican congressmen, Republicans, Democrats, whoever the fuck it is, no way. They're just going to accept the fact that the structure doesn't exist in. Correct. So the way to do that as technology. And here's, here's an example I always use like let's suppose it's 1980, right?

Speaker 1:          01:43:11       And me and you are technologically advanced. Humans have walked on the moon, you know, we have mobile phones, so on and so forth and you and I are having an argument about censorship and you're saying we need to censor some things might come for child pornography. I'm like, we have to have free speech and Jamie appears from 2017 and he goes, you guys are wasting your time because soon you will be able to copy any book with one button and with one button you can send it anywhere on earth at the speed of light. How much does it cost? It's free and if you have to have a magic words to other people can read this books. A censorship is technically impossible. You would. We would both look at him like he's crazy, but that's what's happened. So technology is increasingly. I'm binding the hands of government.

Speaker 1:          01:43:52       When we were kids, the idea that apple with apple didn't exist then maybe, but the apple would tell the government, we're making a lock on our phones that even we can't open because we understand that you are the problem. That would have been unthinkable. And now we have corporations openly defying the state because they realized that they are often the enemy. And that's wonderful. Uber, look, his whole model is we're gonna, we're gonna ask for forgiveness, not permission. We're going to break the law until you guys say it's illegal. We're not going to have licensing. It's great and we're going to become entrenched in the city until you know, then you can't get us out. And then someone might lift, comes along and says, well, they're doing it, but they're not doing it. Right, right. Exactly. Yeah. And then that's the spirit of competition. Yes. It's a beautiful thing. I just wonder how that applies to government. Well, because if the government's hands are tied with religions, then people are going to negotiate through piece just like we do now. Like I mean if you have a problem with macy's, you either return the sweater, you take the loss, but it's, it's fine. But how does that play out though in like a real life scenario? I think what's going to have to happen is just like with books and books, you know, it can go anywhere or at the speed of light. Once you have people being able to move very quickly from place to place, they're going to start becoming effectively the

Speaker 1:          01:45:07       property of whatever country they happen to be in because right now we have things divided by geography, but if you have your have landline technology when it comes to government as a in a cell phone world or even a beyond cell phone world, if you had it where I'm the government or whatever cell phone provider I have that would carry with me if I'm in Taiwan or Russia or the United States as opposed to when I'm in the between these two oceans, it's US law when I'm in between these two oceans is British law.

Speaker 1:          01:45:34       That's fascinating. So do you think that in the future we'll see like a dissolving of borders for the ability to travel back that I think a lot of people support that that's already started happening. Yeah, it's. I mean the idea. Like right now, I could go any country on earth, including North Korea right now, let's listen to case a hundred years ago, this trump thing that got him elected. One of the things was build that wall, build that wall, this. Do you think that this is like a retro idea or an idea of like almost like a longing for nostalgia, like a pushing back against technology, pushing back against progress. Think it's the pushing forward for the idea of self segregation and the idea that you should surround yourself with people that you choose as opposed to people that you are forced to surround yourself with and that people are pack animals and I shouldn't have to.

Speaker 1:          01:46:18       The idea that me and my neighbors in my building, I get to sit down and make a consensus is bullshit. I want to sit down with my friends and make a consensus. Right? But that's what you're talking about. The whole entire United States though, the building, the wall between us and Mexico, but the point seems to me that they're just wanting to keep out the unfortunate people. Well, they also want to keep themselves as a cohesive whole, right, so they want to maintain this idea of Americanness, whereas they're being told that Americanists means everyone on earth can come here. Well, they're not saying that. They're just saying. I mean no one's really saying that anybody can come here. A lot of people, I mean if you're going to what? I've never heard any criteria for saying we can't let this group in. There's always some reason for letting each and every group in and there's never a reason to say no.

Speaker 1:          01:46:57       While the. The rational filter would be, we don't want anyone in here that has an extensive violent criminal history, right? Or I mean it could be levels of education, levels of vacation, of education. Rather someone who wants to come to this country. This is a country of immigrants. This is a country where people try to do better, right? If you're coming here from somewhere else and you want to come to America, but you would, you would be coming here because you want to do better. You want to elevate yourself or elevate your family or give your children the opportunity to be educated in a way that you weren't sure. That's kind of what this is founded on. That way it was founded on it, so it's become. It's certainly wasn't founded on the idea for a country of immigrants. The founding fathers weren't like, yeah, yeah, immigrants.

Speaker 1:          01:47:37       My hero, Alexander Hamilton was an immigrant. I'm an immigrant, but certainly. I mean there's plenty of reasons to have criteria for why people are let it just kind of. But how do you define immigrants? Just because like if I'm in a war torn country, hell yeah, I want to go to America because it's going to be better for me and my family a hundred percent. That's understandable. That doesn't mean that I'm bringing something to the table to America. Not always. Right. Well, I mean you can't say that even about someone who comes from a thriving. Correct me to come over from England, as I said earlier and they're ugly, ugly, looser, so maybe we should have a contest of six or above us. How do you feel? Do you feel you're a six? Uh, I, I think I'm above a sex the way you are, but if you were in Holland, the men are all giant, handsome.

Speaker 1:          01:48:23       I think he might not be as sick as well. Good thing I'm not in Holland. Don't let any of those people over here. Yeah, we got to Sweden. Mr. President, please. New comment if I would make them bigger though. Not going to be 20 feet tall, but the. Yeah, right. They'll grow Godzilla lions. Exactly. Under pressure. Right. But I mean, but going back to the immigrant thing, I mean, this country, essentially everyone who is here who's not native American at one point in time was an immigrant. Sure. But I mean there's different types of differences. The immigrants who try to assimilate and there's the immigrants who don't assimilate and just because we've done some assimilate, I don't see anybody walking around with Buckskin on wearing feathers. I mean there's no one assimilate it from Europe. What do you mean I've assimilated? Well, sort of, but I mean the original people that came here, people that came here.

Speaker 1:          01:49:10       If you're going to assimilate, you're going to assimilate with the native Americans. No one did that. Sure. They conquered them. He can say that. Yeah. I mean it was more like genocide than conquering, but Jenna isn't genocide just when you conquer really well? Well, yeah, in a lot of it is unfortunately because of disease. Well, it's also the fact. I mean the idea that it genocide. I mean these native Americans were tough cookies. These were not these like nature hippies that they're made out to be. I mean there's the reason that baseball teams are native to native Americans because they were mean. They chopped up. Uh, uh, what's her name? The one who founded Rhode Island. I mean, we know the rock. She was hiding behind which before, and she got Scout Scout, so they were tough warlike populations, many of them. So. But the idea that just because we're this many immigrant populations means we have to continue being that way.

Speaker 1:          01:49:54       That's not a really a good argument. Well, it's not really an argument. I'm just saying that we're essentially founded by immigrants. Not Saying we have to keep doing this is what what we became, but we were counted here from somewhere else. Everyone came here from somewhere else, but we were founded by immigrants from very specific places. Now whether that's good or bad is a separate issue, but the idea that, you know, the founding fathers, some of them were from Syria and some of them were from then as well as not true. Right. They're mostly from Europe, mostly specifically from British speaking Europe. Yeah, that's true. I mean, but there were still plenty of immigrants from Germany, plenty of immigrants from Czechoslovakia and Poland. Poland was a huge immigrant population early in the birth of the United States. Right. And they were thinking of making German the official language because they hated the British so much at one point.

Speaker 1:          01:50:39       And there's still a huge German speaking populations, but I think this argument is much more complicated than people make it out to be. And the idea that like, you know, we're going to have complete open borders without consequences is crazy. And listen to my. My mom still lives in a Russian neighborhood in Brooklyn and it's a very different place from the rest of New York and I think that's a good thing, but the idea that it's not a thing at all. It's false. We're. Yeah. Well you can't say it's not a thing at all. So is the question whether or not the consequences of open borders or worth the. The eventual gain some sort of egalitarian society where everyone has the opportunity to advance? Well, I think a lot of times when people are on the left, they don't think of costs. They think if this is a good thing, we don't have to worry about the cost and it's the right thing to do.

Speaker 1:          01:51:24       And then when you bring up the cost, like they're, they're saying, well you're a terrible person. It's like sometimes the cost is worth it, but you have to acknowledge that there is a cost. Like we're seeing this right now with transgender athletes when people are like, well what happens when someone who's grown up mail is fighting someone who's a female? Like this is something we have to grapple with. It's like, oh, you're making up imaginary scenarios like this is happening now, like let's, maybe it's the right thing to do, but you still have to consider what are the costs and radical inclusive progressivism is, they're just, there are no differences. There's no difference between gender. There's no biological difference in gender. So there are so fundamentalist, believe in creationism that God created the world in seven days. They have their own creation is in which is that everyone was created equal and remain.

Speaker 1:          01:52:05       So yeah. Well, it doesn't work when it comes to combat sports for sure. And that's like, that is the, that's where the rubber meets the road, right. Heel doesn't work in any aspect. I mean, if I grew up in, uh, in my, my, my dad's, my parents are lawyers, not that they are in real life. I'm going to certainly have that background and that advantage that other people don't have. Now that might be a good thing or it might be a bad thing, but it's a thing. Yes, it is a thing, especially if you want to continue in that business, right? Yeah. While there's. Yeah, I mean the idea that we're all, that we come from a, an even position that we're all the same. Starting Line is pretty preposterous. Correct. Yeah. The idea is just, I mean, if you want to, like, you can't fix that, you can't change that. That is what it is and you shouldn't want to change it. We should try to do is make the best

Speaker 2:          01:52:46       out of whatever hand you've been given. Right? Right. I think that, I think if you want to look at this country and the real issues that we face there, you know, they're multifaceted, but one of the biggest ones is that there are some areas of our country that continue to, um, have people that are impoverished and in crime ridden areas and these areas don't ever change. Right. And that's one of our biggest problems. I mean, we're so concerned with all these different issues and all sorts of valid issues that are happening all over the world, but the issues of our own impoverished communities that continue to be impoverished south side of Chicago, you know, horrible areas of Texas are. So there's some areas that just don't get any better and they stay that way generation after generation after generation and they don't. There's not enough interest in them in terms of like broad mainstream focus where they say, look, well we have to dedicate and allocate a massive amount of resources to fixing these inner cities.

Speaker 2:          01:53:44       And maybe just one project, one flint, Michigan style project where they say, listen, let's just dump and an x amount of time, resources, money and engineering, figure out some way to fix these areas, provide jobs, make things more safe, you know, established community centers. Do something and let's see if we can do that and have it one case study one impoverished city, see if he could bring it up. And then once you do, move forward and try this in other places I've always had like the best way to make America stronger is to have less losers. Like what's the best way to have less losers? Well, one one, one way is to give people more of a chance. Give people. Like if you grew up in suburban Los Angeles and you live in some nice neighborhood and you know, studio city or something like that, it's fairly safe and you have a much higher likelihood of success than someone who grows up in a crime ridden drug filled environment where people are constantly going to jail and those, those sort of recurring cycles of poverty and crime, they happened generation after generation after generation and some in some cases, like in Baltimore, there's clear evidence of systematic racism, you know, that literally people were stopped from buying houses in certain areas.

Speaker 2:          01:54:55       Stop from moving into areas. But in other areas it's like, it's just almost like it does it itself because he's right,

Speaker 1:          01:55:02       right. And, and they, they, I always have this litmus test for people to find out if they're left wing or right wing. So people like to pretend I'm neither, I'm both. You ask them are some people better than others? And if you're right wing you're going to say yes. And if you're left wing, you're going to start babbling a whole speech better in like, what does better mean? Whatever you think. In any sense of the word, but it's sucking dicks as some people who are better and some people are clear that's right here, but what causes that? Some people are like, no, they just need to learn how to suck dicks better. Right? Right. And not everyone that I get, I don't. This is not a road on, I know enough about to go down, but dare you. Okay. Let's say play the flute, right?

Speaker 1:          01:55:38       So the skin flute or regular flu. Some people are better at it, right? Some people are better at math, some people and that's going to be a function of the mind, you know, and that's something that not everyone's going to be able to equally good at. And you have to start with that point that we are born with different gifts, um, or we have different interests and we pursue those specialty focus and determination. Yeah, I mean there's certain things like guitarists, like there's, there's no doubt about it. This isn't like Stevie Ray Vaughan, Jimi Hendrix, Gary Clark Jr is people that have like an exceptional ability to play incredible music out of a guitar. Does that, what does that, is that mean? Where's that coming from? Well, it's also, you and I are both self taught. I'm sure you never get a major in podcasting. I never took an English course, you know, and, and you've had many different careers over your life.

Speaker 1:          01:56:20       So vi and that's just a function of the self. It's not a function of, of uh, the culture, the, it is, it's also luck. It's also being in the right place at the right time. It's also finding a job that exists that fills my very unique personality and making that job exist. No one, you know, no one made me write this book. I did a kickstarter, I raised the 30 grand and I'm like, now I'm going to do it myself. So the publishing industry didn't know what to make of it. And how's it been? How's it? It's, I mean, just, I got it. I was the first one to have a, a cspan book TV for a kickstarter book a whole hour. I mean, I'm on all these different shows talking about it because they didn't know it and it's been a great success with as that in that way it's got parallels I think to podcasting.

Speaker 1:          01:57:01       Yes, in that once you find something that you're really passionate about this and people realize that you're really passionate about and you put so much effort and focus into it, they can see that in your work. Yes, and they appreciate that and I think people are very much, and this is another reason I load cynicism. People are drawn to earnestness, they are drawn into passion and they are drawn to sincerity and honesty and like La, La and we're hungry for it and we're desperate for it and especially I think increasingly young males because there's so much eye rolling and there's so much snark and all this other stuff which I like, but they like, I want to be a better guy. I want to be a smarter person. One of the big lies I was told growing up is that the jocks and the nerds hate each other, and when that was working with Matt Hughes on his book and hanging out with his fighter buddies, it was a total mutual admiration society.

Speaker 1:          01:57:46       There was no eyebrow raised, there was no shit talking. It was complete like, wow, you're a smart dude, you know, let me learn from you. And I'm like, wow, you guys are athletes. Let me learn from you. And it's totally mutual respect. It totally blew my mind. Well, one of the things about martial artists is that there's everybody kind of. I mean some people start off with a certain physical talents and physical gifts, but when it comes to like technique and ability, you have to learn this, you know, and it's something that's very humbling along the way. And so they have this understanding that hard work and focus and technique and knowledge. Yes. All applied together equals results. Yeah. And they're awesome people and obviously this is your world, but I mean I've been. I was blown away by these guys and had such respect for them and I didn't think I would. I think it's changing. I think perception of who fighters are is changing and I think that's one of the reasons why there's such a big blow back when someone is like a thuggish bully asshole ish sort of and that

Speaker 2:          01:58:42       these people aren't respected nearly as much as someone like a George St Pierre who is a gentleman, right? Conor mcgregor who was just this wild, brilliant trash talker. Right? And these people like you, you, you, you could recognize that there some significant mind games going on. There's some real thinking and they're not macho in the sense of they're not posturing. Like they don't need to stand up and be like, I can kick your ass like all the fighters. I knew if people go up to the bar and be like, you know, I bet you I could kick your ass. They'd be like, I'm sure you can. You know what I mean? It still happens to these guys. They have to walk away from fights all the time, but they do it gladly because they don't have a chip. Some of them do. I'm sure you have a chip on the shoulder of most of the ones I met.

Speaker 2:          01:59:17       None of them did and they would just be like, okay, that's fine. I saw it in person one night at a nightclub in Vegas with some guy was talking shit to chocolate Dell. It was so ridiculous. I mean I was just like, what is this guy doing? And then chocolate Dell just kind of looked at him dead eyed and you know, it said something to them and you see the guy like saw his life passed before his eyes and eventually realized came to his senses and people pulled them away. But I was like, what is this fucking guy doing? And it's so funny that one of the scariest moments of my life when I was working with he was on his book. He's such a happy go lucky guy. And then once I got an argument his face changed and I'm like, oh yeah, that's who you are.

Speaker 2:          01:59:52       It, I completely forgot that he killed her. He's one of the greatest welterweight champion. It was like, Oh yeah, Shit. Then I felt stupid to. Well Matt was with first guy that incorporated great wrestling with real high level submissions. When you see submitted Matt Frank Trigg, when he submitted George St Pierre, like he submitted George Saint Pierre with very advanced move. He hit him with a farsighted armbar. George committed to a memorial but didn't have control of Matt's body and Matt hit the far side arm bar and spun around on him. I remember watching that was for. It was at 4:59 of the first round. I believe he had one second to go and George tapping really quick. I don't remember what time it was, but I remember that just a brilliant move. He said he, when he was starting out was he was like, I know I'm strong and I'm a good wrestler.

Speaker 2:          02:00:38       I got to learn technique or else it's going to be used against me. So it was very, very strategic with his approach. He really wasn't a big factor in that whole camp. That miletich fighting system camp was Jeremy Horn who was like really like kind of a nerdy guy and a lot of. He's not a bully type guy at all, not a very strong guy, not a freak athlete, but had more than a hundred and 50 professional fights and one a shit ton of them and was really. It was the first guy to beat chocolate. They'll put them to sleep from the bottom with an arm triangle from the bottom because he was just a brilliant tactician and just very good at staying calm. Very good at figuring out like it was all technique. Jeremy was all technique and still is. Yeah. I never met you.

Speaker 2:          02:01:19       I met, always spoke extremely highly of. He's a great guy and all those people and he's a super polite, really kindhearted guy who just happens to be a trained killer. Right. A lot of these guys that's not super polite, but he is. He's very polite. You don't think he's super blessed. So the thing with that, I mean I can't say enough good things about him, like having been friends with him and his family. To this day I still go out to hillsborough to visit them, has changed my life so profoundly, but he would. Matt Hughes meets you. He'll be making fun of you and people have them on a pedestal so they won't respond back and he looks like an asshole. So when I first got the project, this is a great story. I was on the phone with his manager and his manager goes, Matt's got a twin brother and when they start messing with you, you just got to stand there and take it until they're tired. And I thought to myself, Nigga, I'm from Brooklyn, we don't play that shit. I swear to God as much as I thought it, I thought it. And then I think racist words to yourself during. I'm thinking one now.

Speaker 2:          02:02:10       So I meet Matt and he starts with me and I hit him back hard and he loved it. He loves being the butt of a joke because he wants to be a regular guy. He hates being on a pedestal. He hates being. I'm the world champion. He's those normal dude and I think it kind of bothers him that people won't make fun of him back. Well, that's sort of fight gym culture though. Everybody makes fun of it. It's the. But they're scared to make fun of him because it's all my God Matt Hughes and it's like, no, no, no, no. Please hit me. Like he's always cackling and laugh, you know, as the best instagram page. Who? Derrick Lewis, Derek, the beast, Lewis he's got were just knocked out. Travis Brown is one of the top heavyweights contenders. His fucking instagram is whole Arius. What? Hilarie he just finds the most fucked up shit online and puts it on his instagram page.

Speaker 2:          02:02:57       Like one of them was a picture of a girl with like 15 hot dogs and her mouth and it said something like, don't worry about it. These guys are all just like brothers to me. We're just going to hang out. What do you remember? Forrest Griffin for Halloween with supergirl, supergirl with the crop top and he captioned it. Does this make me look gay? And he's like, how about. No, it was hilarious. Well, that's problematic. Left. Yeah, I mean these guys, look, there's a lot of gallows humor and a lot of like really funny guys that are involved in like these fight gems. Oh yeah. It's because they're dealing with such incredible stress levels that they need some sort of a blow off valve. Right. You know, Derrick Lewis is one of the top heavyweight cage fighting fighters on the planet earth. I mean, he's one of the best in the UFC right now.

Speaker 2:          02:03:47       He's just knocked out. Travis Browne, knocked him out cold and recovered from a rough first round, got hurt, came back and knocked him out. So his instagram just like, you would think that he'd be like this crazy psychopaths running hills and screaming into the night, you know, like I remember when I was a kid, um, there was a video of Mostafa Ham show versus Marvin Hagler. They will do it showing this promo clip and they were, I lived in Boston and Hagler was a Boston guy was from brockton and he used to train in the Cape because it was freezing cold in the winter and they'd have him running these sand dudes in the renter. And while he's running them, he was screaming war and Hagler was terrifying because he was just ripped and muscular and he had a bald head and he just was a destroyer. And so that was my idea of like what a fighter is like a daily, like this solemn.

Speaker 2:          02:04:39       Right, you know, character clowns in the best possible way. Yeah. A lot of them are very, very funny and it just and appreciate, even if they're not funded, the appreciate a good sense of humor. A lot of joking around for breezy over doom jokes around a lot. He's pretty funny. Yeah. There's a lot of them that are like that. It's interesting. You know. And then when people are too serious and they lose, that's when the public goes after them. Right? Like Ronda Rousey. Oh yeah, yeah. Like I can beat anyone on earth, man. When the public one after her boy woo dark. And Matt always said, if you're not losing, you're not fighting the right people. Well, it's true. Yeah. I mean, unless you're some fucking freak of athleticism and some top of the food chain, Roy Jones Jr type character. And there's always gonna be those guys just go, there's always outliers, right?

Speaker 2:          02:05:29       Who essentially their bar movers, like they change expectations. Like there was expectations for performances inside the UFC. And then there was Anderson Silva and then Anderson Silva came along and everybody went, okay, well we now we know that's possible. But were you, were you calling the fight when he broke his shin? Yes. What was that like in real life to see? So second time I've seen that first time I saw it was Corey Hill broke his shin. And um, I, I had to scream at the referee that time because the referee didn't realize it had happened. Oh my God. And so, uh, because he was in a different position, the referee was not in a position to see. And then corey went down and um, I forget his name, I know the dude, I'm sorry. But when his opponent was attacking him, the referee hadn't realized that core his leg, it's snapped in half yet.

Speaker 2:          02:06:17       So I'm fucking screaming. I took my headphones off and I stood up and I'm screaming, stop. The fight stopped the fight. And it was, did they stop it? They heard, you know, I think he figured it out. I don't know if it helped I, but I just couldn't help it. I just had to jump up. It means it was. I'd only seen it on film before. I've never seen anybody's leg snap like that in real life. Right. And it's seen in a few times and kickboxing match. Oh, you had a lot live only on video. And it's like, I can't believe the human body can do that. I knew I could do it. I've seen it happen a few times. It happened to one of the best kick boxers in the world. Tyrone spong just a couple of years ago. And it essentially shut his kickboxing career now.

Speaker 2:          02:06:56       He was fighting go. Saki was also one of the best kickbox is in the world. And go checked one of his kicks and tyrone's leg just act like a joint. Yeah. And spong is just elite of the elite. He's one of the. It was like these two guys, tyrone spong and go con sock. It was like a world class, kickboxing fight where the whole kickboxing community, like people that are like myself, there are big fans were like, whoo, here we go. Here we go and see it. And like that there. When you had the Anderson one was very unfortunate, but you know that they think he broke his leg actually with a kick earlier in that round. Oh yeah. It was hurting him apparently already. And then he threw that and it just snapped in half so it might have been already compromised by a similar situation.

Speaker 2:          02:07:41       And then that one maybe like a hairline fracture and that one just snapped it all in half that I couldn't handle that. It's rough. It's a rough game, man. Corey Hill, the guy, the first guy that had happened to, he's dead now. He died. I don't remember what he died of, but he died real young. Yeah, there's Corey Hill. Dale Heart. Yeah, that's who it is. Yeah. That was a rough, rough fucking fight to watch men seat snap in half like that. So it's only happened twice in the UFC in that way. But we've had, you know, we've had a significant number of broken bones, like Frank Mir snapped Tim Silvia's arm and half. That was pretty fucked up. I'd met Tim. He was a good guy. He's a good guy. Quiet guy. Yeah. He's, you know, he's a guy that just didn't have like a lot of athletic talent, right?

Speaker 2:          02:08:31       Just hard work, determination and a little bit of steroids and a great coach. Yeah. And Pat Miletich, she's like, well, let's work with what I have and I'm going to make you a champion. That's what you did back in the day, man, when he fought Rico Rodriguez. And back in the day when Mexicans supplements were a lot easier to get away with Tim. Sylvia was a fucking destroyer. Tim Silvia. He missed like that era was the era of the guys who fought in pride, the wild West era where you could just kind of do whatever the fuck you want. If Sylvia existed in that era, just Jesus Christ, man, he might've been one of the best at best. Like if you go back to like go see if you can find Tim Silvia versus Rico Rodriguez. That's when he won the title dude. He was a fucking destroyed. He had to cut weight to make to 65.

Speaker 2:          02:09:17       He was fucking 70 feet tall, jacked. And this was an Tim Silvia was people think of Tim Silvia. They think of Tim Silvia being overweight when he fought rate mercery got knocked out with one punch. You in the early days of Tim. Sylvia, when he was on top of his game, he was fucking terrifying. That's. See if you can find like a better photo of it though. Like you could see like how fucking huge was. Yeah, there he is right there. He was jacked and so big. That was when he fought cabbage. Beat the fuck out of cattle. I was backstage when he fought randy and remember randy got him knocked out within like 20 seconds. He had him on the ground, went through a crazy punch and branded it and tim didn't see coming. It was. It was insane. Yeah. Well, Tim was friends with Randy, so he was really shocked that a randy wanted to fight him in the first place and that was when randy was a light heavyweight. Tim was heavyweight and randy hit him with a fake inside leg kick and a giant bottle of an overhand right right away and tim didn't even know what the fuck happened. He was out on his feet and he came back to that locker room is I was all swollen. She was like, Holy Shit. I just saw you two minutes ago. It was crazy. That's the fight game. Yeah. It's a fight game. Yeah. Tim Silvia doesn't get enough love. It really doesn't. Now I see him now. Like it's just enormous. Three hundred 71 pounds.

Speaker 3:          02:10:34       Yeah. Is this a recent one? When is this from it. I don't think he's fighting anymore. He's. He does a lot of bowhunting now. I think that's what he does with medically unfit to two years ago, ruled medically unfit to compete and reality fighting because it was 371 pounds. See? That was. That's. That's crazy. That means he gained a hundred 10 pounds from the time he was in his prime. He says, no, it's not good. Not good, but when he was at his best, he's a very under appreciated heavyweight. No, I just think I hope I people being friends with these people has helped me out so much in regular life and they talk about a lot how this carries over and it really, really does. The way they carry themselves, the way they think. Like Matt always said, for every move there's a counter for every counter, there's a counter and that's the kind of thing where like if you're going to move someone in your career, you're going to have to leave some blank exposed and you have to become less risk averse and make that shot and sometimes you're not gonna make that shot, but you still have to go for it.

Speaker 3:          02:11:37       Just because you see the dangerous doesn't mean there's always going to be dangerous. You have to fucking go for it. Yeah. There's definitely some lessons to be learned from all martial arts training that what I've always said is this. Something that I learned from my earliest taekwondo instructor was the taekwondo and all martial arts are essentially a veil of vehicle for human potential. Devo, developing your human potential and that these difficult things that you do, if you can overcome them, you'll find lessons in those that you could apply to business. Personal relationships. Like anything life throws at you. Oh yeah. And, and also, uh, there's a North Korean story. We're in 1978, I think there were, there in the DMZ, the border between north and South Korea and the Americans wanted to chop down a tree or to prune it. And the North Koreans took their ax and chop them up and killed them.

Speaker 3:          02:12:24       That acs is on display now in North Korea. I saw it chopped up the Americans, but they, they, they boast that they use taekwondo dell to, to conquer these greater numbers of Americans because it's a Korean martial art. Oh, right. They did it because they're like, you're not chopping down this tree fund. So they killed them because they wanted to chop down a tree and they Americans launched Operation Paul Bunyan and came back with like 200 guys and carriers. We look at job at that, this trade and is, did they left the stump to be like, fuck you. America? Yeah. Yeah. Um, I think the real issue with fighters is making sure that they recognize that father time is real and that the expiration date is real and that there's only a certain amount of punishment. The physical frame, your meat vehicle that you're carrying through this life can endure.

Speaker 3:          02:13:10       And then after awhile it's downhill. Well, you know what, that hit close to home for me because I always wanted to have abs, right? And let's not laugh. And Joe Rogan, I work with my coach Dick Talents and he's like, I can get you to abs. He got me to abs. You got it. ABS. Ceos. What's the. Yeah. I wrote an article about how getting out changed my life. You. Here's the spoiler was zero positive outcome. I put, I put the APP, vote on tinder. No one fucking cared, but now I have to maintain them or else I'm going to be the men and decline and I'm going to be scared. I'm losing my peak, you know, so that's something that every guy goes through. So now I'm in this fucking trap of having to stick by this fucking regimen. Okay, well I can help you right there.

Speaker 3:          02:13:51       How's that starts? The way you're looking at it, you're looking at it like it's trap expectations that must be maintained, right? That's just a mind trap. Will have in it. Just not. You know, you're not. You could instead look only towards always improving and don't ever think of it as a trap. Think of it as a perpetual life like path. Oh sure I am improving at. The point is I can't be like this. Body fat can increase a certain policy. That's like what people do like you hear about that. When people become famous, like when they become famous or become wealthy, they get panicky and they want to cling to isolate and insulate themselves. They lose what got them. They become risk averse. They lose what got them to the dance in the first place. My abs did not get me to any dance. They Florida.

Speaker 3:          02:14:35       They should. Well, they showed them to the right people. You're a single guy. I am a desperate yes. Desperately. Single Guy. Pull up that shirt and right in front of that camera going to be preaching mamas to send you. Send some pussy or way you could fill up the photo that I've already had to start tanning I. I had to. Yeah, it's been required of you because I do a lot of TV and my body fat was low enough that I looked holocaust, the unscreened. Oh Jesus. So your body fat. It's low enough that I looked sick and like my family, I didn't really speak to thought I was literally starving. Cool. What are you eating? Nothing. Oh, look at that dude. You're good. That's very good. It's pretty good, dude. That's good. Yeah. I think you're gonna. Get some pussy now. I think so. He's drinking monster energy drink.

Speaker 3:          02:15:23       Kind of maintained his fucking metabolome monster on the podcast. Monster in the bedroom. This. Oh, you son of a bitch. I just mean it like choking. That's the sugar stuff. Sugar, sugar freestyle with low sugar, low carb, low carb. Scammy. Joe. It was a little bit of sugar, right? It's 10 calories for the can. I mean 10 grams or calories. Ten grams of sugar. 10, 25 calories for the can. Oh, that's not bad. Yeah. Yeah. There's nothing. There's seven grams of carbs. Those things are tasty. They're a little too tasty. I can't drink those. That's a sponsor of the UFC, so they always had them laying around and some. So sometimes I'll drink one during a broadcast, but then you have to fucking pee. The problem is that stuff runs through you fast. Thanks for telling me that. As I'm sitting here initially. I know on the stomach. Hang in there. I can hang in there. It's 4:00. I'm thinking we're going to go for another like 15 minutes. Perfect. Really? Do we just. Wow. Got. We've got to do this format. This Sean, you're a Brooklyn guy. You live in New York. I Love Brooklyn. Yes. How long are you gonna? Be on here for A. I just left for a couple of days. Oh, beautiful. Yeah. You got any plans? What are you gonna do when you're out here and hanging out with my buddy matt, who you know, he's an internet

Speaker 1:          02:16:29       personality. I'm just going to do just some work and that's it. Just experienced life on the west coast. I'm not an la fan to know what bothers you about. There's a certain corruption about it. Corruption. Yeah. I feel like there's a veneer of sunshine and stability, but underneath that there's a lot of a fakeness and and nastiness and I new Yorkers were more direct and more surface. That's interesting. Fakeness and nastiness. How so? Meaning like when I meet people in La and they're like, Oh, you're an author. Like I'm sorry I haven't heard any of your books. It's like, why the fuck are you? Sorry, I'm nobody. Do you know what I mean? Like that kind of thing. So they don't. They're scared of offending someone in case that might be important or it's like we should definitely grab lunch, meaning good to see you, but it doesn't mean literally we should grab lunch.

Speaker 1:          02:17:15       It's all these codes that you could find a losers like that New York to pull. I'm not hanging out with them. I guess they met the wrong people in la. Are you meeting them then? What do you mean? In New York? Well, no, you're generalizing like you're generalizing these people that you're meeting that they're worried about offending you. It's it. It's happened enough that it's part of the culture here. It's not just one data point Joe Rogan and it's just like. It's jarring to me. I'm not used to it from Brooklyn. You're a big fan of that data point line. I, yeah, I, I mean, but you're limited data points and how many people you meet. How often are you here? Twenty 4 million, 25. All of them. How often do you here? For like once a year. Yeah. I think the thing about La is there's pockets of humanity, like these voices of interesting people and I, I, I'm a cultivator of interesting people.

Speaker 1:          02:18:04       I like to like when I find them, I cleaned to them. The problem is yes, that's my approach. There's always someone that's trying to get into that group. That's not right. Yes. Yeah. Entry Ism. Yeah. And then you know, and that they bring their crew and it's been a. it's infected. Yeah. It becomes an issue and especially amongst comedians becomes an issue. Oh God, they want to work with you and do shows with you and stuff like that. And you're like, hey. The same happened. And I, I, I did two books with dl Hughley who's also an amazingly wonderful person and I didn't see that much around him. Like he hangs with their various crew. He's very smart, very smart. I learned a lot from him. He's not suffering any fools. No, exactly. And it's also really fun being the white guy with a group of black people going to a club or something like that.

Speaker 1:          02:18:49       And then when she use the n word I, it's in the chapter in the first book about it. Which book that I did two books with him. The first call I want you to shut the fuck up. And he said, Uncle Sam on the cover. That's the book I want you to shut the fuck up. That is hilarious. Title for a book. The second one's called black man. White House. I came up with both those titles and their and I want you to shut the fuck up as a very good time. I want you to shut the fuck up. He's Uncle Sam on the kind of. Yeah, I learned a lot from him. Also. Just a great, great guy. Yeah, he's a good dude. He's a decent guy. Like I'm sure you know all the comedians and who were the assholes behind the scenes and who aren't and don't think anyone thinks badly of him.

Speaker 1:          02:19:28       He's very. Whereas this hardness sleeve. Yeah. I don't know. Deal that well. I've run into him a few times and had good conversations with him and he's always been very nice, but you're right. I don't ever hear bad things. He's a mench. A mench is interesting. I want to know is that I have. I actually have a blowup of that firm. We did a book signing and he signed it to me over my instructions to my Nigga Michael Nicholas piece pimping. It's hanging up in the house. Isn't that great? There's my name, little desk. Audacity of dopes is ruining America. That's hilarious. I love how you can say fuck, as long as you put it in like a pound sign for the you will. They wanted a curse because there was a book called go the fuck to sleep, which did huge. So they're like, okay, we need a curse in the title.

Speaker 1:          02:20:09       I'm like, all right, so offensive to me that you can cover up one letter and everybody's like, okay, we're good. Yeah, no my friends, new book's going to call fuck whales. Like fuck whales and all these other shit. You know an f f has a pound signs like, oh well this is spot and I'll put this on the shelf in the supermarket. Isn't it funny? Yeah. You could just do that. Such child. No language has changed because we used to not be able to say fuck. And now we can't say the n word, but it's when we were kids it was, fuck. That was the problem. You'd never seen writing ever while you did. Did Archie Bunker's say the n word on all in the family? He must have. I would imagine he did. I know that a Fred Redd Foxx did redd foxx did on Sanford and sons because I remember I remember him saying it about like, I think it was like a jury.

Speaker 1:          02:20:53       I think it was like during a trial or something like that. I'm trying to remember what the line was, but it was. He said the last time I saw this many niggers was in a Tarzan movie and I'm like, fuck, did they put that on tv? But it was a different world and it was Red Fox who's by the way, like almost like, I mean him and Richard Pryor. We're like one of two of the most important figures of like black standup comedy of any standup comedy. Yeah, for sure. I mean the comedians are the ones who are always pushing the envelope and that's their job and it enrages me when people are trying to. That's not fun. I have my next book. I have this whole chapter about that's not funny. That's like I knew a North Korean refugee and he would, he went to high school here and he'd be hanging out with his friends and they'd be like, Hey, remember when we were kids there was pokemon.

Speaker 1:          02:21:40       He'd be like, yeah, except instead of Pokemon, I watched my debts starve to death along with most of my village. So you have that dark sense of humor. He joked around about that because you have to, like, you come from that culture. If you don't laugh, you're not going to be able to kind of deal with it. So you're going to tell him he can't joke about starbuck, his starving family. Who the fuck are you? Why did that guy get out? Uh, you, he escaped to China. He was basically a slave. A woman kind of found him. She was a Christian. There's a bit Christian population in China and then it's a whole process. Wow. How do you escape the China? Did he bribed the guards in the middle? During the day? He just crossed the Tumen River and they just happen not to see him, but he's a kid.

Speaker 1:          02:22:17       How old was he? I mean, he was under 16 and over 11, somewhere in that range. So when you, when someone from your family escapes, your whole family's punished. So the great leader, Kim Il Sung said class enemies must be exterminated. Two, three generations. So in America, when people like Rick Santorum say the families, the basic unit of society unit means that which can't be subdivided further. They put that into practice. So if someone from your family, there's something wrong, three generations are punished. So if someone escapes, that's going to be really bad for use. They often get fake. They bribed someone to get a fake death certificate. Yeah. So someone escapes your parents and then grandparents were kids or siblings, kids or anybody. Whoever the fuck can be around is imprisoned or deported to some countryside. Like if you're in Pyongyang, there's something called Sung Monday, have a caste system, right?

Speaker 1:          02:23:08       Which has three layers, which is how loyal you are to the government and that determines where you can live in the country and what your job could be. So you're not allowed to step foot in the capital city unless you're loyal to the regime. So what happens is if you're from Pyongyang and you defect, your family's going to get sent to Lex bumble, fuck, you know, who knows? And now you've got to raise rice and anyone from North Korea who's an ambassador, they have family back there. So make sure that you don't make any mistakes and try to stay in that country. Yes, they have layers upon layers of control. They're brilliant at it. It's horrific, but brilliant, right? Yes. Yeah, they're, I mean these are really the supermind master, the super villains of our time, horrific and its execution, but brilliant. And it's the whole master plan of it.

Speaker 1:          02:23:53       Other things, do they tell people don't wear ripped jeans to the DMZ because North Korea takes these photos and shows US citizens go look before the rest of the country, rest of the world dressed in rags. Wow, that's a brilliant, brilliant. It's absolutely brilliant. It is Alaris that were so wealthy in America that we buy jeans that are already scratched up or like acid, like let's just put acid on your genes. All right, that's fine. I was watching this video online about how they make those, uh, what's the word that they use for distress is stress where they were taking like a sander blasting and she's like, what the fuck are we doing? I went into this whole gene, a phase. I got 30 pairs because I thought it was just. I started collecting them and then I got. The point is when they're raw, you wear them, the ink breaks down and they distress in their own.

Speaker 1:          02:24:38       They get these cool fades and I wore my best pair to like this fancy denim store in La and no one praise me. And I'm like, fuck you in this subculture. And I know one praised you upset. Yeah. At the last parent earth have these persimmon died. You know, Japanese do at the time. This is like two years ago, they were cocky sheebu man. What does that hockey she boo. It's unripened persimmon die. I don't know what that is. That person is a person that a person is a fruit, right? Right. So they take the unripened juice, they soak the clothing in it and it becomes this pinkish Orange Hue. And this co company, sugarcane made jeans that color and they looked pinkish orange, you and they look sick. They look amazing. I know what you're single. Is that right? Because that'll just. That'll show the abs personal fucking stained

Speaker 3:          02:25:24       genes that you're worried about being praised for. That was about the ones that call me. I've got Sour Samurai jeans, Khakis. Shubie died 24 ounce cocktail Shubu. Sorry. I got the sugar cane. One 24 ounce. I liked how they weigh them. Like who gives a fuck how much there was that? The heavier the gene, the better. The fades. A interesting. Yeah. Huh. Okay. See those kinds of genes don't interest me because they. They seem like it's hard to move around them. No. Well that's when you break them down. That's the whole point. Yeah. But they're not like, like, you know what? These are right here. These are barbell jeans. Oh yeah. Yeah, I know about those. Yeah. They stretch for big quads. Do these are like fucking sweatpants, man. Throw head kicks. Wearing these, these. I like these. And there's another company called Mott and bow.

That's the kind of Shit I liked it. Well, the company I like called naked and famous, they're Canadian. They have genes that change colors. He knows naked and famous. They've got A. I've got a fuck ton of them, but they don't. They're not salmon colored Khaki Shubu fucking. That's true. And that looks like sugar cubes are ridiculous. I've got the mud dive. I got 30 pairs. Man.

Who would know the guy at the denim stores should fucking know. That's the one guy who should know Jamie, Jamie. Whereas Kanye West sneakers.

Speaker 3:          02:26:58       That's not. That's not the whole. That's a whole different vibe. That's basic shit. No, no, no. This is a little. It is. It is. Come on. I like the hipster stuff. Shit. I don't have the actual crazies that are like 5,080. Oh, come on. They have 5,000, $8,000 dollars wants to make. I'm not a fan. Not a fan either. You've got a real collector. Gets the stuff that's not that expensive but is really unique and khaki. Shibu is cocky shape. Do you still wear them or you just praise? I cry and I was gonna Ram today and I'm like, am I gonna wear today? Nobody brought them up. I know. I know. Set I. I navy. But you don't seem like a Fashionista. You don't seem like the guys who made the shirt you're wearing, man. It's got epilepsy. Oh, it's good for ugly people.

Speaker 3:          02:27:42       Then you're saying you're saying people who are going to end up, you know how like board games or like ages five and up. So this is ugly and up. Oh, I get it. Yeah. I mean it's not a terrible shirt but it's, you know. I mean if you're into really being praised for your clothes, I wouldn't imagine that would be your best choice. Well, I was going to wear a suit. I wear suits on, on Fox all the time and I'm probably one of the best dressed people network. Do you enjoy being on Fox? I love it. Really? Oh, I love it. Why? Because I get to be the same thing that gets me in trouble at parties and I'm rewarded for it. What is the thing that gets you in trouble at parties? Vicious? Uh, if this rating denigrating

Speaker 1:          02:28:22       all these things, like the nasty. It's so fun. What do you, why do you like doing that? Because I think there's a lot of horrible people and they need to be called out on their bullshit and I'm in a position to do it. What kind of arguments do you have on file? I've never seen you on Fox for. Well, I don't watch too much. It's fine. I just, I, it's just like if I'm talking about politicians, I always make it a point to be as denigrating and humiliate and to them personally as possible. But when you're talking to them personally, not personally, but we're talking about them. Whatever the issue is. I'm not usually in paddle actual politicians. I was on with John Bolton ones, which was weird, but I mean I go, I'm out. I'm shopping for blood, you know, with these types, someone's got to be Batman and punching these people in the face metaphorically.

Speaker 1:          02:29:01       Metaphorically. Yeah. So you enjoy it because it gives you an opportunity to intervene. Yeah, send a message home to will it to be mean. Which I'm good at, but it's not culturally socially acceptable. This is why I don't drink because you're afraid you're going to be more mean. I got meaner. Yeah. Oh yeah. And the thing is I'm really funny for people who just listen to you. You gave me like the sideways looking through your eyebrows. Oh yeah. But that's the thing like my, my, my, my, my, my mouth is very quick so I'll have that good line and the next day I'm like, that person's going to feel like shit and I shouldn't have said it. Oh yeah. And that they don't deserve that at a party. But you're meant it. At the time I met the joke, it came out. I mean the joke landed.

Speaker 1:          02:29:41       Well, that's the thing about hanging out with comedians to like, you know, you know, a lot of comics that I know, but you can kind of get away with that, like you could shit on a comic and if it's funny they'll laugh with you, but if it's a regular person, especially a female, you don't want to do that. They don't deserve it at all and I feel guilty for a long time and I shouldn't feel guilty. I should feel guilty, especially if they're not used to it. Yeah. And especially if they come at you thinking, oh my friends tell me I'm funny, and it's just like, well you started the wrong fucking war. Yeah. Maybe they could make fun of your genes and it really hurt you. They wouldn't have those sheebu. They wouldn't have the language to do so they wouldn't know the language.

Speaker 1:          02:30:16       Shibu is it? Was it that obscure? Well, ted, you heard of it. I don't know anything man. You don't even know the rules to basketball. Khaki. She was. The reason why those jeans are awesome is because they're obscure. Oh, that's one of those guys. Yeah, things rare things are good. One hundred percent, a hundred percent. Are you a car guy? You're interested in? I don't know how to drive. Because you're in New York City. Yeah. Yeah. That's weird. But at like rare plants. Rare fish or you're just in a rare shit. I like having stuff that's only your own because when everyone puts their sticky fingers on it, it ruins it. So like if you really like something, be fine. Other people like it as well and become popular. You get upset. Hell on earth. Are you one of those dudes that gets bombed out with a bang? It's popular. It's the worst thing ever. It's the worst thing. It hurts me physically. It doesn't really. Oh yeah. Yeah. It's so silly though. They're silly because then stupid people are liking what you like and then you've got a question. Your choices. That's stupid. People like all sorts of stuff. That's awesome. But if. Yeah, but incorrectly, they like it for the wrong reasons. What about ice cream with have stupid people like chocolate ice. You can calculate what

Speaker 3:          02:31:20       the hell it can kind of. Crazy person. Are you that you don't like chocolate? No. My favorite ice cream is pink, is pink bubblegum from Baskin Robbins and I fucking had to go to every baskin Robbins and Manhattan trying to find it every year. And it drives me crazy. I go on my instagram, I finally found it. Yeah, but there's nothing wrong with chocolate like you don't like chocolate ice cream. Chocolate ice cream was God damn delicious. Chuck Haagen, daas chocolate, a Haagen Daz. Ooh, la La. Look at Ms Dot Nancy is important. We got along so well their whole foods. So we started talking about an ice cream. I'm so fancy. I eat Haagen, Daz fucking supermarket in the country.

Speaker 3:          02:32:02       That's your baskin robbins. Say Chocolate guy. Haagen Daz with your perrier. Mr Rogan. I enjoy it at like a sparkling water. So it gives you a little bit of flavor, but you don't like the person in juice. Um, well, your genes are pink. They're not paying salmon pink for people who are struggling with their gait thoughts. I said salmon is the struggle and realize that, right? My struggle. You go over someone's house and they have salmon code sheets. You'd be like, oh, I don't have salmon colored sheets. I have lavender. I'm kidding. I'm kidding. I'm kidding. Sad, sad, sad. Everything black. The whole house, including the wallpaper. I don't have wallpaper. No. I think wallpaper is super gay. Wallpapers. Gay. You don't think so? Um, I've never thought about it. I think the first time I've ever entertained that thought and my years in this planet, whether or not wallpapered have anything to do with your sexual proclivities, I think it's all that designery stuff.

Speaker 3:          02:33:00       Oh, okay. Like the house, it's over designed. It's like, well, what's up with this dude? Some people will just really into design like chains. Well, not anymore. It's just so critical. Not other people's weird shit, but your own weird shit. You just like you see through a filter and loving put on blast. No, it's fascinating. And it'd be both. Yes. It definitely can be. You can live your life through these contradictions. Yeah. And it's, it's a fun life to live. Yeah, sure. There's nothing wrong to blame me for getting upset that no one is praising my khaki pants. Yes. Again, because I see that you care. Like I've never wanted someone to praise me for a piece of clothing that I wore, but maybe since I was like 12 and I had a kiss tee shirt on, I searched so long for them and I got the last pair on earth.

Speaker 3:          02:33:42       Oh my God. That's a problem in and of itself. They even went looking for those fucking salmon disastrous jeans. I got 29 other bears that you'd approve of. I got the stainless steel ones. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. You have stainless steel pants? Yeah. How's that work? It's sustaining steel. A cotton weave. Who makes sense? Naked and famous. They were like 250 pairs made and I got them. What does it look like? It's just wrinkly. The. It's as if you're wearing wet jeans, but they're dry. That's how it feels like it's stiff, but why do they call it stainless steel? Because the weave is part 10 percent stainless steel. Ninety percent cotton or the chaperone heavy? No, they're not that heavy, but they're aren't weird. Yeah. Pull those up. Jamie stainless steel naked and famous jeans. Yeah. That's so odd. This is like the opposite of barbell jeans.

Speaker 3:          02:34:27       Yes. Like that. You can't throw kicks in them. That's right. And it's was hard to walk in at first because you're walking a robot and I actually more than once to the airport and I got scared. I'm like, Oh fuck. Oh, metal detector. They don't detect metal anymore. I have those to the pornography pants. Pornography. The inside cuff is a vintage pornography. Oh, that's hilarious. Yeah. I wonder if you can control with those. Like it just looks like newsprint of Qa. There's the stainless steel wants to the right of the pinup. Yeah, those are stainless steel ones. Yeah. So they're just heavy. They're stiff. They're not actually that heavy.

Speaker 3:          02:35:07       Huh. Interesting. So like stainless steel thread. So it's just like a novelty. There is no benefit to but they just look at the. The wrinkling looks very cool. The puckering to the fabric. You're an interesting guy. Michael is a euphemism, you know, I said that to Jamie for the show. So I said something about being interesting and that always means something else. No, you're an interesting guy. You are an interesting guy. Like I mean it in the most sincere way, but that word can have many connotations. It can but not. It's not how I'm reading it. Okay. Isn't that what's important? Intent, right? Yes. One hundred percent intent. Yes. So we should wrap this up, but uh, I really appreciate you coming here. I really appreciate having a conversation with you and finding out about your weird tastes, but you're a good dude man. You're a funny guy and a very smart guy.
