Think about that. And for such an important occasion, I trust one 800 flowers.com and right now one 800 flowers.com is giving my listeners a free, I feel like I shouldn't call you my listeners.

Speaker 1:          00:01:06       That seems a bit Douchey, almost as Douchey as saying the Joe Rogan experience when my name is actually Joe Rogan.

Go to one 800 flowers.com from your desktop or mobile device.

Speaker 1:          00:02:12       Click on the radio microphone in the upper right hand corner and enter in j r e that's one 800 flowers.com and enter j r e or call 1-800-FLOWERS and mention j r e we are also brought to you by ting. Ting is a mobile company that does things on their own terms and their own terms is they decided to cut out all the nonsense that's usually associated with owning a cell phone and having cell phone coverage. Things like early termination fees, things like contracts, things like charging you for x amount of minutes and if you get over that, it's an overage freed. The way Tim handles it, it's much cleaner and in my opinion it's, it's more, it's just more ethical. Look, cell phone companies know they have you by the balls. He needed a cell phone. Everybody does. If you're one of those fucking weird contrarians, it's like I don't even own a cell phone.

Speaker 1:          00:03:11       Guess what? Fuck face. You're behind the curve. That shit's ridiculous. If you're, it's 2014 if you don't have a cell phone, there's something wrong with you. Okay, it's you, you're the problem. But if you do have a cell phone, you, you know the pitfalls. Ting eliminates almost all of them. First of all, they buy time on the sprint backbone. So what they do is they rent sprint service. So, and then they sell it back to you. But they do it in a really simple, easy way. Instead of saying you get x amount of minutes per month, you just pay for what you use. If you use more, you pay more. If you use less, you pay less. And 98% of people, 98% would save money with Ting. And that is clearly just because they do mobile differently. $440 is the average annual savings per device for a business with 11 to 20 employees.

Speaker 1:          00:04:07       Think about that shit. And they have great phones. You can bring over I phones from sprint, iPhone four, iPhone five, you can buy one of their awesome android devices. They all have the top of the line. Android phones. They have the Samsung Galaxy note three, which is what I have with Tim now. I, I, I poured my galaxy note over to 10. Now, um, they have the HTC one, they have, um, all sorts of different options and even they've gone old school. You can buy one of those old fucking flip phones if you're into it. They have all kinds of different styles and different, different options for both. Uh, the, the, the type of phone you have and the, um, and the, the way you, uh, do you use your phone. If you're one of those people that really likes to use a flip phone and we were talking about the other day, there's a benefit and there's something cool about being able to open it and then shut it when the phone's off like I'm done with you close that phone.

Speaker 1:          00:05:07       You don't get that by pressing your thumb on glass. You also, you don't get that same feeling you get when you actually press a button to type a number. I do miss that. There's a benefit in that, but that's all nonsense. You could get that anywhere. The bottom line is what you can get with ting is no bullshit cell phone service, excellent coverage because they use the sprint backbone and you can get really good phones and you can cut out all the nonsense where you, you don't, you don't feel like you're getting fucked over, you know, and I think that's like one of the most important things about what ting offers. I think every cell phone service in the future is going to have to shift over to the, their model of pricing because I think the idea of you, you know, you're only getting a certain amount of minutes and if you get over that they charge you for it.

Speaker 1:          00:05:51       Like that's all stupid. Just pay for what you use. And if you use very little, you pay very little. And as I said, for most people you would save money with Ting, 98% of people that's, that's quite a claim. The other thing I like about ting is on their second anniversary, for no reason, they just decided to slash prices they slash their prices because they got a better offer. They decided, hey, let's celebrate two years in business. Let's celebrate, uh, an ethic that people seem to be resonating with and let's just slashed prices. And it's particularly beneficial for power users. So if you're one of those dudes, it's on Twitter all day and downloading videos and that kind of Shit Tengiz for you. So go to rogan.ting.com and save $25 off of any of their new delicious android devices. That's rogan.ting.com we're also brought to you by on it.

Speaker 1:          00:06:45       Oh and and I t on it is what we call a human optimization website. What we try to carry and sell is all the best things that we can find. Whether it is strength and conditioning equipment, whether it is foods and healthy snacks, whether it is supplements like Alpha brain or shroom tech sport or new mood. We try to send you or sell you the very best nutritional supplements, the very best supplements as far as protein powders, we carry hemp force protein powder, which is from Canada, where Nick Cutter, Aka Craig Davidson is from the fine land of Canada, is allowed to grow and sell hemp to these dullards in America that aren't allowed to grow their own because they're fucking goofy. Government forbids it because, because hemp knows marijuana. They're like cousins. They know each other real well. It's fucking government doesn't trust him. It's too close, too close to that marijuana criminal.

Speaker 1:          00:07:46       Um, you do not test positive is a big question I get, I'd have to answer it. I have to talk about it every time. You do not test positive for THC, if you by hemp, uh, I have to say this because the fucking retards that run the, uh, what is it at customs and New Zealand's, oh my God, you dummies. I had a friend who ordered some shit in New Zealand and customs. They took and destroyed his hemp force protein powder. You dummies. It's probably some thieves. The customers, they probably stole it and they're, they're probably making their own protein shakes now and laugh and they're dicks off. But according to him, what they said was that they confiscated and destroyed his hemp force because they thought it was a marijuana product.

Speaker 1:          00:08:34       We live in a time that will be mocked one day, mocked the same way we mock powdered wigs and putting skirts over a tables the way they used to put table leg dresses in the olden days to keep people from getting impure thoughts. They will mock us, they will mock us for this, this thing that we have with him, but we sell it. And if you're in America or in a country that's not retarded, you can buy it and you can eat it and it's good for you. But you should know that. You can test positive for some things that aren't drugs. Like if you eat poppy seed bagels, you will test positive for heroin. I know it sounds crazy, but it is true. Um, the other things that we carry it on it, things like warrior bar, which is one of our new products, which is a completely natural buffalo meat bar, buffalo and cranberries.

Speaker 1:          00:09:23       It's made by an old native American recipe for preserving meat. And there's no antibiotics, no added hormones, no nitrates. And each bar has 140 calories, only four grams of fat, four grams of fat, excuse me. And 14 grams of protein per each two ounce serving super healthy for you. No MSG, no soy, no lactose. And you, you can eat these and you know, not worry about what you're putting into your body, not worry about, uh, you know, sometimes you're hungry and you want a snack.

Speaker 2:          00:10:48       the Joe Rogan experience. Joe Rogan podcast by night all day.

Speaker 1:          00:11:00       So my pal Matt stags, he sends me this book and he's like, dude, you got to read this book. This book is fucked up. You're going to love it. Cause he knows I love Stephen King and that, you know, that that's sort of twisted genre. So He sends me this book right here. Yeah, it's in my bag here somewhere. Uh, he sends me Your Book and uh, I enjoy the fucking shit out of it. I am, I want, I want to pull it out because, um, it's so beat up and dogeared proves, oh, there we go. Troop. And, uh, I guess I'm about, what am I about 200 plus pages into it. Um, it's really getting juicy. I really, I'm really enjoying it, man. Good. It's really good. Good, good. And it's, it's really fun and it's, you know, it's a long the lines of like stand by me or one of those classic old Stephen King Books. You like the stand or, or pet cemetery where it's just twisted and dark and there's psychological shit going on and there's horrific things having those monsters and it's really fucking cool man. And um, when he sent it to me, he told me that Nick Carter wasn't your real name. And I was like,

Speaker 3:          00:12:14       well, what's, what's the deal there? Yeah. What is, what's the deal there? Well, um, you know, I think the most concerning thing to me would be, is it anyone, cause I mean, I grew up like you, like Stephen King is my idol. Steve, there is no, nobody. I've read more than Stephen King and beyond that, like I grew up as a horror reader. I mean I have read everything now. I see. You mean you started diversify but I wouldn't even say diversify cause that's sort of like, I love the horror genre stole like Clive Barker, obviously Stephen King, Peter Straub, Robert Hart. Mccammon I mean the list goes on and on and on that we started who I cut my teeth on. So, um, so really my agents said, listen, you've been writing these things under your own name and their kind of their, I wouldn't even classify them as literary, but maybe they would be a little more to that side.

Speaker 3:          00:12:59       Uh, rather than, than, than the horror genre. And, um, he sort of felt like, listen, people aren't going to, people might be confused or, or people might, you know, let's have some separation basically. And the best way to do this separation is just to give you a new name, put this, put this horror work. Cause when I sent him the truth, I mean there's no way it's anything other than just like I wanted to write like an eighties style hard fireball and sort of horror novel, like not splitting any hairs, not trying to like make, make it met ironic or anything. Just trying to go straight ahead. The horror that I grew up, you know, loving, you know, and try and sort of be an homage to, to, to those writers in that time. Um, so there's no doubt it was going to come out as clearly a horror novel.

Speaker 3:          00:13:40       So he said, let's, let's just make up a pseudonym. And I, I'm, I wouldn't say I'm new to this, but you know, you know, you have an agent as well. And like, I mean, I trust my agent. I'm, I imagine in most cases you trust your agent. Maybe not always. You don't trust them at all? No. Then we'll get to talk to me about that type of thing. Yeah. Yeah. I don't allow them, well I think maybe looking back, you know, what we did is we settled on this pseudonym and then I quickly went, it went away, you know, trying to erase any sort of sentiment that I was ashamed of it because I think that's, I live in Toronto and I hang out with a lot of people in the horror, the horror genre sort of genre writers. And their question was like, are you ashamed? I'm like, fuck no. That would be the, if that would be the worst thing for me, for people to think that, you know, cause I'm as proud as what I've done is the troop is any other writing I've ever done.

Speaker 1:          00:14:26       Well, so when you say literary, like what are your other books? I'm not familiar with your other brother books.

Speaker 3:          00:14:31       Well, I wrote a book called Rustin Bone, which is like a, a book, uh, um, the short yeah. Short stories. Um, uh, and then I wrote a book called the fighter, not, not the same a fighter, the Christian Bale movie, but, um, and I wrote a book just recently called Cataract City, which is so it's sort of like, I dunno, um, I wouldn't say chuck, he was an early

Speaker 4:          00:14:52       influence, but sort of like macho, like fighting, boxing, dogfighting, repossession, you know, those were sort of the things really sort of manly endeavors that they were, I was concerned about it, interested in with those books, but they weren't, you know, they certainly weren't literary like Alice Munro or something like that. I Dunno who else. She's a kid. She's a Canadian, uh, you know, a Canadian short story writer, like a Salmon Rushdie or you know, a Phillip Roth. Those kind of like serious literary writers know about Salman Rushdie is a bunch of Muslims. Really Mad. Don't like that dude. Pat Stevens was on their side and disappointed and he was finally allowed to stick his head up after, I don't know, like they put a fat lie out on him. Right. He's it as the fallow, I think. I think the guy you who put it out died. So I think the fat white died with him or maybe they carried it over.

Speaker 4:          00:15:42       I don't really know how that works, but he has showing up at public functions, so I think he's less concerned about being killed. Four guy. Yeah. You think about like man of all this stuff. Could you imagine someone puts a fatwa on you for something that you say during the podcast are ridiculous. Yeah. I know whoever did it and I'd kill them first before you can just kill the guy in the fatwa ends. That's, yeah, you're fucked. Yeah, exactly. They shouldn't be putting out too many fat was because it's like, I'm going to get you, it's the day and age. You can't hide behind a fatwa anymore. No, exactly. Today's Internet, they can find you, but I can find you too. You could publicly expose them for their fatwa shaming. Right. Um, so I don't, I'm not familiar with Salman Rushdie's work. I've read a little bit of it and I found it quite boring to me, honestly.

Speaker 4:          00:16:28       Yeah, I think, I think too, there's somewhat with literary writing, like I had to, I had to read it because you went to school and did an English degree. So I feel like there like medicine, it's like it's not necessarily it's good for you. There's this sense of like you should be reading it because it's good for you and it'll make you a better person. But I'm sort of, I'm past all that now. I'd just like to read what I like to read and if that happens to be, you know, sort of crunchy literary fiction where it's like dense text we'll find. But if it's, if it's something like a really good horror novel or a thriller novel, I mean I'm all over that too. As far as I'm concerned. When it comes to fiction, whether it's a film or whether it's a book, I only want to be entertained totally.

Speaker 4:          00:17:07       Or not illuminating. Elucidate, enriching me with your or not. I agree. But I went, you know, you go to school, right? And you have too much time on your hands, right? Yeah. You wake up in the morning and what do you have to do? Maybe go to a class for two hours a day. Um, and so I think people in that realm feel like they, cause they had the time to like invest in like really crunchy mind sort of melting. No distinction that really tests you but and you know, and then they start to look down on someone who just wants to read. Like, like for example, I didn't mention at all in my first one, I did a um, uh, my English degree. You wouldn't talk about Stephen King because he's got these sort of looks like, oh, him. Oh well yeah, I used to read him when I was 12 mocked.

Speaker 4:          00:17:49       Yeah. He gets mocked and I was like, you know, after awhile you're just like, wait a sec, fuck off. You know, like I love Stephen King. I love a lot of writers that you guys seem to think are, you know, base or bullet below your esteem and who are you in the first place? We're just sitting in some writing workshop. You haven't published the Goddamn thing. Like not to be an asshole. I mean I like some of these people that I'm, that I'm talking about, but like, you know, yeah, there was, there was that certain, that hierarchy and unless you're reading at this level, but it's like most of people who like to read have like a job that really occupies them and they get home at night maybe and they don't have all that much energy. They just want to read the, you know, for enjoyment, you know, and why, why looked down on that.

Speaker 4:          00:18:28       Yeah. And anytime you're concerned about image, so much so that you're ignoring great works. Like Stephen King King wrote some really fun stuff. Absolutely. And, and really and deeply psychologically thrilling as well. You can't dismiss the stand. No, just can't or, or it was lot. And one thing that I noticed too, like trying to write a horror book is I think it's really difficult to scare people in this day and age, right? Like it's, it's, and so you would probably, I don't know, maybe you can answer this a little bit in terms of liking in comedy. Like I read Stephen King when I was 12 and I just read them. First of all, he's the writer that got boys to read of our generation, you know, I mean there's nothing else other than maybe choose your own adventure books that I was reading back then until I sort of graduated to Stephen King and um, and so you first you read it just because you love Stephen King.

Speaker 4:          00:19:22       And then second, you know, I went back as a writer myself and you, you sort of treat the book is like an engine, the movie mechanic treats and engine. You're trying to break it down and see what, what is working, how does this work, how does he scare you? And that's where you realize it's genius because it's like, you know, I'm working on like a model t Ford and he's got like this, he's working on the Delorean engine from back to the future. That's how much he's above, you know, a lot of us in terms of like he is, he works at a level I think of like conjuring fear that is so difficult to first of all, see how it works. Break it down and then try and do it yourself. Um, and so when you have people like looking down on him for, for that, I just don't think they've really interacted with his work as closely as I have because first of all, if you're saying he sucks, I'm like, I can't even touch him in some ways.

Speaker 4:          00:20:10       And so what are you saying about me? Well, I just think it's one of those things where it becomes trendy to say sucks. Yeah. It puts you in this sort of elevated category of intellectual. I think that's horseshit because fiction, like when you start talking about monsters or vampires, you're automatically a fool or you're doing foolish work. Yes. Yeah. Whereas if you're talking about depression and suicide and you know you're serious, stop. I'm done with you. Right. When it comes to like fictional movies, especially like if someone says, oh my God, it was an amazing movie. I cried eyes out.

Speaker 5:          00:20:48       It was a horrible, not me not going to see a piece of shit where you make me cry. I don't want to cry. I've plenty of opportunity to cry. You want to cry? Watch a documentary on Rwanda. Okay. Don't, don't fucking cry because some fake ass hole made some stupid movie where some people are pretending terrible things happening. You're not going to learn from that. You're just not, I like to be elevated by my fiction or at least thrilled. Yeah, totally. I want to cry. No, no, I mean, and, and I, I completely agree. Um, and, and so, and want another thing Stephen King does really well is his childhood. I don't think there's another writer to my mind really who writes about childhood as, as well as Steven King captures it in like a book, like itch or, or the or, well, the movie, the body at that became stand by me.

Speaker 5:          00:21:35       You know, he captures that time in a, in a boy's life, especially that, um, it's just remarkable. You know what I mean? And, and uh, so, so I think now too, I know Patton Oswald did like a, I think it was, I forget where he did it, but he did like a long article based on his admiration really for Stephen King. So I think now there's a renaissance, finally, Stephen King. It's got to be close to 70 now where people are finding like, okay, this guy's, this guy's pretty good. Well, again, it's just one of those things people love calling someone out or they love shaming someone. They love diminishing someone's work. They just, they just enjoy it. Especially if it elevates them. Yes. Yeah. Or it's like a hipstery thing. It's like, well, too many people like this, it can't be good. Um, because too many people like it, and I have to like these sort of offbeat, well, haven't you read the offbeat Peruvian poet?

Speaker 5:          00:22:25       No, I haven't. I mean, I'm sure he or she is awesome. Maybe, but maybe not. Maybe not exactly. Someone tried to turn you onto a band that till they tell you it's amazing and it's shit. Yeah. You got to go down to like a basement somewhere and they'll be playing to like five people or does this give you, they send you all the time. People send me like a youtube clip and it's dog eat dog shit music. And they were like, this is amazing. This band, there's so nuanced. Yeah, that's right. That's right. And if you don't end sort of like if you don't get it then you're out. Yeah. I guess that's sort of like your lapse in judgment or ability to really recognize how good this is and that's what separates them from you. It's not complex enough. That's right. Yeah. Yeah. That's right.

Speaker 5:          00:23:07       Craig. I am lacking in some, some serious way. You know, I'm Stephen King. It's a, it's an interesting comparison that you said that Stephen King captures childhood really well cause I think that's something you did really well in this book is as as well. Thank you. You captured this uh, sort of lord of the flies type scenario. I don't want to give away too much of the script. Sure. But when things go awry in the, in the beginning you sort of see this social hierarchy that's going on and you see shifts in the social hierarchy based on the events that take place. And it's, it's quite fascinating. Um, I really wish that you did it under your own name and I hope like Richard Bachmann,

Speaker 4:          00:23:47       Bachmann cry. Why didn't Steven King do that? Go with Bachman. Why he did it is because he was too prolific. Is that what his agent just said? Listen man, first of all, like I don't get it man, cause he's probably got, cause he's still to this day, he's still pumping out books at an enormous rate and big like slobber knocking books. He's not, you know, little tiny. Uh, so I think he probably writes like me on a good day, I can write like maybe 3000 words. That's if like the pistons are firing really well and I try and write a thousand words every day. You know, that's sort of my, my limit. But he must write like 5,000 words a day consistently. And it's strong, strong stuff. So, so that was why Bachman came to be, because his agent was like, listen, we just can't be flooding the market. We Stephen King, we got to, let's separate you out.

Speaker 4:          00:24:33       Let's just put some of these stuff out under a different name. And then you know, you still have your book out every year, which is still on an astronomical rate. So, yeah, it was just for him. It was a totally a sense of, he just had too much to say. Wow. Yeah. That's amazing. And he eventually took those Bachman books and put them under Stephen King. Yeah. Yeah. It became like an open secret really. You know, and you're right. Then he republished them under under his own name basically was um, what was the movie that they did where it was the dark half Bachman book? I'm not sure, but it was based on really, it was based at Richard Stark or George Stark was his, his pseudonym and that that's when it's student and started started stocking. Right. Yeah. Yeah. That was definitely based on his experience having written under a pseudonym.

Speaker 4:          00:25:16       Um, I, that might've been a Bachman book. Um, but the, there was another example of his, his, you know, ability to sort of not just be so prolific but also be prolific under like some really established territory with its forced his work. He was always a writer. Yes. How many times did he do a book about a writer character? Yeah. Yeah. I know. I think it's because the narrative is easier to write from that perspective. You know, even the voice that you find, I think it's like I'm a writer, this voices, because I was reading, rereading the body lately made into stand by me and that's again, that's a writer character who's writing that. And um, you're right, he does have a lot of writer characters, which is something I've avoided up to this point. But you know, looking at the success, what's that? A lot of writers in Maine, what's all, yeah, you're right.

Speaker 4:          00:26:05       It's almost all set in Maine. He started staked out that territory. Absolutely. As have you ever been to Maine? I've never, I used to live in New Brunswick, which is right sort of right above main, but I never crossed the border and went down into Stephen King, terrorized stupid. I should have, there's some beautiful parts of Maine, but the there I don't want, I want to be kind if I can. There's some of the dumbest human beings on the phone saying they'll take disrespect at that. If I was being unkind, I would call them a bunch of kid fucking Weirdos that live in the woods. Um, not all of them. And there's those great parts of Maine. Bangor is a great city.

Speaker 6:          00:26:44       Yeah. Uh, the, the real problem with Maine is there's some areas where there's nothing. Like there's an area between Portland, Maine, and Bangor. When you're driving up from Boston where you go at least an hour without seeing anything driving 70 miles an hour and no radio, there's nothing. Oh, you can't even catch a station, won't get anything that is just sled. You hit scan and you're fucking radio starts smoking. It just keeps going. There's nothing, I mean, I don't know how it is now. There's no radio, there's no gas stations, man. There's just a straight shot of like 70 miles of just, I've just dairy road, pine trees or whenever. If you run out of gas, you're fucked. Ceville oh man. And if it's snowing out, you're really fucked. Yeah. We used to do that drive all the time cause we do gigs up in Bangor. Oh, okay. If you made fun of Maine, even at all. I mean even slightly, the pitchforks are coming up and scream at you. You call them maniacs if you called the maniacs. Correct. Get up and get fucking Naheed mangy they, they love it. They love it up there. It's beautiful. It's absolutely beautiful country and you know they have everything up there. Deer and Moose.

Speaker 4:          00:27:50       Yeah. It's like great that way start if you want to get back to nature, I feel like that's probably the place you might start. You want to be a survivalist. Yeah. Main might be a place to get your crew started. It's probably one of the least populated states in the union. Yeah, it's way it's way out there, you know, for us to New Brunswick is pretty, you know, you're well east at that point.

Speaker 6:          00:28:08       But what's odd is Montreal is north. Yes. Main yet completely cosmopolitan. Yeah. Very, very modern in every respect. The people are fantastic and edgy.

Speaker 4:          00:28:22       Been up there for you, I guess for MMA events and comedy events as well. Both for both. Oh, I'm going to Montreal since the early nineties probably since 1990 itself. Cause when I first started going up there, I love mine. I do too. We've never had an opportunity to, to live there. I've lived, oh well you know, well across the country, but of course there's the Francophone influence there, which I don't, I don't know. I guess you going up there as an American, I don't know how much interaction you have with that necessarily, you know? Do you really? Yeah, well of course. Yeah. I mean a lot of, a lot of great MMA fighters are, are, are at least a couple of frank phoned GSP and Patrick Coty and Lazo. David was Ocj with Wazo classes. Carmel. There's um, yeah that holds five. The, the Tristar Gym from Montreal is one of the best MMA gyms in the world, which I don't know how to happen, you know, cause MMA like I used to live in Calgary and that's actually another odd MMA hotbed. There's, there's a lot, there's a lot of interest. I don't know if there's a lot of great fighters yet who have come out of Calgary, but there's a quite a few are there now. Good fighters. Very good fighters coming up and yeah, and I did a magazine article on, on one guy who, um, uh, you know, who won. I just followed him to his first professional fight actually, which was an interesting sort of thing to follow any, actually he hurt himself really badly in that fight and that was it. That was his career. Um,

Speaker 5:          00:29:42       but, but I know the gym that he was working out of had, it was a real, I mean it was, I've, I've rarely been and felt that level of like comradery, but also competition. I'm sort of in such a tight, small area, so, so, um, that's what you build great fighters that pressure. Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely. Yeah. I don't know what it is about Canada and producing, uh, mixed martial arts fighters, but also mixed martial arts fans. There's more MMA fans per capita in Canada than anywhere. Yeah. You bloat the, uh, the Toronto, what is it? The Air Canada Center. We sell that place out, I think, and they sold out the Roger Center at the Roger Center. Gigantic, huge place that used to be. He used to have a different name. Right. What was it? Skydome skydome. Yeah, exactly. So that's, and that's amazing. 60,000, 60,000 to why it was GSP fight I think versus just Jake shields.

Speaker 5:          00:30:34       Oh, that's right. That's right. Yeah, we are, we're a great sporting supporting nation. You know, we just had the raptors just got bounced out of the playoffs, like the basketball team and uh, you know, selling out and then they had like people like 20,000 fans clustered outside of the arena watching. So that's amazing. Yeah, it is. It's a great, it's, and it's great that you guys in the UFC come up and I think the, I think for a while there, it was mostly you guys were down in Las Vegas and a few other places, but then you decided to come up to Canada and it's, but it's been good for you guys. Been great for us too. We'll Canada of just has a love of all things manly. Yes, we do have that, I think. Yeah. They're not tracking by it. No. Whereas there's a lot of embarrassment in America.

Speaker 5:          00:31:16       Things manly. Yeah. Push it away or like, oh, that's a little too testosterone. He kind of a thing. Yeah. I have a friend who was talking about, um, a, a sitcom that he was working on and he was, uh, talking about, um, there's a woman that was, uh, one of the leads that was trying to, uh, introduce you is also one of the writers and she was trying to introduce these male characters. There were like the type of guys that she likes and they were like, oh, he's two to two jockeys. Too much of a meathead. Like they didn't want anybody who was interested in other women other than the girl that they're with. They didn't want that dilemma. They didn't want anyone who was dominant over the woman in the relationship. They didn't want anybody who was obsessed with her body. You're working out were like, those are like all of our boat and we just can't go.

Speaker 5:          00:32:03       You can't have those things. And it was the writers themselves because they felt threatened by that, those types of men. So they were rejecting those characters. Girls don't like that. Those guys, there's a Turkey, you know, guys who wear scarves and stuff. She was getting angry. She was like, what do you see these, this is what I like. Like yeah, me because the type of guys I like, women don't like these guys. Like what? And whether you like him or not, that's, that's kind of like a, that's an element of our society to like why purposely sort of ignore them and oh no, that wouldn't screen test whether we don't, we don't want say embarrassing. Well I think I was thinking too about before coming here, like you,

Speaker 4:          00:32:40       your career has sort of had, I think you must have run up against that a lot because like I remember when fear factor came out, there was a sense, you know, there were these hyperbolic newspaper articles like, ah, society is collapsing. You know, it's fear factor. Like we're, you know what I mean? People are doing things that like, why are we getting people to eat bugs or stuff? And I thought, I love that show. You know what I mean? And then the UFC comes along and it's the same kind of like Ha, what was one of your politicians had the, the human cockfight. A bunch of them use that, right? Yeah. And so you've been, you've been situated a along that that line I think and so you'd be, I'd be sensitized to it if I were you. At this point it's like, come on, screw off. Well, if I was

Speaker 6:          00:33:19       doing things from a public relations standpoint, I've been nothing but poor choices. Right. You looked at it that way. Yeah. When I was first starting to work for the UFC was in 1997 and the people that was, I wasn't on sitcoms on Newsradio the sitcoms. That's right. Yeah. People were talking to me like I was doing porn. Like they're like, what the fuck are you doing? Like that. Like they thought it ruin your career really. You're involved in cage fighting. Like what's wrong? I was like, it's just, it's martial arts they take that takes place in a cage. It could take place in a high school gymnasium. Would that be okay with you? Would that make it more sanitized for you as in a field? Would that be all right, frank? What difference does it make where it takes place in martial arts, but the, um, the rejection of things manly.

Speaker 6:          00:33:58       I mean, it has its roots in some pretty disgusting behavior. You know, when you see like the Steubenville rape case and sure the jocks conspired as long, uh, along with people that worked at the school to high sort of, yeah, cover that shit up, that kind of, you know, misogynistic, supported thinking. The group think of, you know, fuck these bitches, you know? Yeah. All the men together. But those are just weak humans. Those are pathetic humans. It has nothing to do with masculinity. Yeah, no, I completely agree. But that's the thing. It was like masculinity gets tied into all the reprehensible aspects of male behavior against women, not just a celebration of things that men love. Men love certain things that don't harm other people. Like men love cars that are loud and fast. Yes. You know, men love a lot of thing. Men love shooting guns.

Speaker 6:          00:34:54       Doesn't mean they want to kill people. No. It's like there's something fun about shooting a gun. And if you bring that up and you say that, oh, I don't have gun, I don't own guns, that's not leaving. They need to take away all the guns. I mean, I've had these conversations with people whenever there's a school shooting, they need to take away all the guns. Maybe they need to stop giving people these fucking drugs that make them psychotic. You ever think about the dragon, the over it? Yeah. That's sort of the over medication of some of these kids. And 90% of all school shooters, 90 plus are either on Ssri or eyes or are recovering from ssrs. They're in withdrawal from antidepressants. And it doesn't necessarily mean that the antidepressants caused that. But I do believe there's, without a doubt and over prescription of, without a doubt, he go to a doctor. The doctor's not going to look at a holistic approach to your life and say, hey, you know, maybe you were raised by shitty human beings. Yeah. Maybe you need counseling for a decade

Speaker 4:          00:35:49       Beta blocker and that'll all the bad thoughts

Speaker 6:          00:35:51       walled off. Yeah. And we'll not only that, all your inhibitions are going to be less, and your ability to understand the consequences of your actions will be less into your ability to be depressed and to feel terrible about bad actions has also been removed. There's a lot of things that happen when you put people on drugs that change your neurochemistry. It doesn't mean that those drugs are bad. You know, I get these fucking tweets from these people that can understand a complex argument or a nuanced conversation. I have friends personally that have benefited greatly from antidepressants. Yeah, and I don't I, it's not that I deny them or don't support them. I think there's definitely a place for them, but I think when you look at all these people that have killed mass groups of people and you find this one common denominator over and over and over again to ignore that, but concentrate entirely on the tool itself is ridiculous.

Speaker 6:          00:36:44       Most human beings are absolutely incapable of walking into a school and shooting a bunch of children. Most human beings. What is it about some human beings that are capable? I don't know, but that's not being discussed. Gun Control's being discussed, the raising of children's not being discussed, it's gun control that's being discussed. I find that ridiculous. I really do. And I think that that it sort of gets lumped in with this rejection of manliness, this, you know, this, uh, support of anything that's anti male or this denial of these base male instincts yeah. Don't necessarily have to be harmful to other people like competition.

Speaker 4:          00:37:26       Yeah. Yeah. I mean, there's so much about it. I mean, I'm, my career is in a way, uh, you know, again, my early stuff was all about my boat men doing men things, which some of it is, is silly and self harming, but, but also it's like something that I think built into our genome we need to express in, in a certain way. You know what I mean? So, but I know that a certain segment of, of readers or who just were like, they were turned off and immediately in the same way that and the same way that these TV writers were just like, no, but that's just the wrong people for your stuff. That's all new defined. You know what you need to find a receptive audience. And the same, I think your career has been a lot of that is about finding the right.

Speaker 4:          00:38:05       Uh, and, and also I think also for both of us, it's about making people realize that like, I'm not a meathead, you're not a meathead. Do you know what I mean? There's, but the, I feel like people think that like I'm, they read this book and they assume that I'm, I am a meathead or am I wrote a book called the fighter's. Yeah. Yeah. And so your boxing match, right, right. And would be the same. Same, I don't mean to put words in your mouth, but I don't know if you've had the same experiences yourself and it's sort of like, um, you know, I wasn't raised that way. I don't, I don't myself a typical

Speaker 5:          00:38:36       and whatever. If you're a jock, that's fine. You know what I mean? Not, you know, you're a Steubenville Ville type, you know, if you have that kind of job mentality, it's not the, I wouldn't say that it's like a, what would you call that? I'd say it Bro, but I don't think so. I think grows are more lights, rapist. It's straight up a rapist. He's a shit human being and most likely you have a bad relationship with your mother or your sisters or someone in your family who just did a terrible job of expressing to you the responsibility of being the physically stronger sex and the the one that is the penetrator, not the penetrate. Yeah. You know, this whole relationship between men and women. I think a huge part of it is how they're raised, how human beings are raised and what kind of relationship where they have with their family.

Speaker 5:          00:39:20       I had a really good relationship with my mother. I'm really lucky in that respect. Like I've never had any hate towards women, but I have friends that genuinely don't, women like women, I mean, and that came from their, from their upbringing. Either because their father, maybe they had to divorce or something is bad. It's like she's awful bad. Moms are bad moms started out bad mom's bad relationships with women and they just, they just don't like women. I mean, I don't do, I don't have good friends that are like that, but I know people that will say fucking cons. They're all the same. They'll say shit like that around you and you're like, come on, you're missing out. This is a lot of great chicks out there. Just like there's a lot of dudes that I would, I would, if I, there's some people that if I was alone with them in the woods, I would seriously think about killing them right away with it.

Speaker 5:          00:40:02       Yeah. Yeah. If you are ready. Yeah. If you around, here's the perfect example. If you are around that fucking not Joe Paterno, who was the other guy that got raped? Oh, Sandusky. I wasn't around. If I was in the woods and it was just me and sent dusk and there's sort of a grave, maybe just sit and there's no one around and I looked to the left and there's just miles and miles of woods. Fuck you. I kill that guy. Yeah. Yeah. If I knew he raped kids 100% I'd kill him if I could get away with it. Why? Because I don't believe that all lives are created equal. I don't, I think that there's, there's a yin and a Yang to the world. There's good and bad. There's positive and negative. There's give and take and you got to trim weeds, right? You gotta, you gotta shoot dogs that have rabies.

Speaker 5:          00:40:49       You know, there's a lot of things that happen in this world that are uncomfortable that people don't like. Their unfortunate but that they need to be done. And when you find some guy likes to rape children, you should remove him from the earth. Yeah, yeah. This is a mess. You can't clean this up. No, and I feel like it's high to know that I'm probably getting out of my depth here in terms of what my real understanding of it, but I feel like it's such a built, like it's something deep in your Dna Helix and your genome. Like you're not going to route it out. You know what I mean? The best you can do is hope that you don't or aren't in a situation or you're, you're, you're somehow away from the source of what you're, you're, you know, issue is basically, but I mean, if you're out in society, I mean, of course you're going to be sort of up against, and I don't think you get cured from something like that.

Speaker 5:          00:41:34       I mean, I don't, I again, I don't know for sure, but I feel like, yeah, yeah. I, well I think there may be a time in the future where we can understand and get to the root of these behaviors and perhaps access whatever it is, is wrong in a person's mind that makes them either have a desire to victimize children or have the ability to victimize children and not feel remorse for it or be attracted to it. Do you as a writer, um, do you, cause I was a comic. I watch a lot of things that I don't agree with and I will be no other comedians doing things or just, no, no, no, no, no, no. Like a watch religious programs. Okay. Yeah. I watch a conservative right wing propaganda shows and just be seeding and every muscle tense when you're watching it sometimes, oh no, just try to get empty when I do those things because I don't want to get angry.

Speaker 5:          00:42:29       Um, I, what I want to do is try to find the patterns in their thinking and trying and you see a lot of commonality in, in these sort of group think mindset's whether it's Republicans or I see it in feminists a lot. I see it in male feminists, I see it in, um, there's people like they, they choose sides and then there's a massive amount of confirmation bias and you see it, you know, you see it both ways. But as a writer, do you like to study like certain mindsets or certain people that are just completely alien to your way of thinking to try to grab pieces of the way they interact to jump into their head and said you could trace a narrative thread through their eyes? I have tried that, I think. I think that's, you know, I know writers and I certainly know Comedians who, I mean it's sort of like the, the, the, the rage based comedian.

Speaker 5:          00:43:24       Like you really want to sort of confront these things, you know, and like really go on a good harangue. I'm it. And I think, I think, uh, really it's sometimes not even funny with a, with a comedian, but it's really true and it's really like honest and it's really, you're actually getting more of a social commentary at that point. Like Hicks. Yeah, exactly. Like you're getting a really strong distilled, powerful medicine, you know. Um, and there's some writers who sort of work in the satirists domain, I guess, who started do the same thing, you know, over the length of a book. Um, so I've tried that. I've never found as much success with it, at least not yet, you know? Um, cause the same thing. Of course I uh, we have a strong conservative, you know, base, you know, conservative radio always gets, gets on my nerves.

Speaker 5:          00:44:09       It's funny cause we have Right now we have rob Ford are our mayor and Toronto who's doing all sorts of hilarious because he is in Rehab now. Uh, you know, and he's like, he's no end of fun. You know, I was sitting at the bar yesterday when I got in and I was talking to somebody, he's act at a defense contractor actually. And he was like, he, you know, he sounds like he seems like a pretty good guy. At least he's straight out honest. I'm like, he is a, he was a guy you could probably go out and feel like you'd have a beer

Speaker 3:          00:44:32       with and I don't think he looked down at you for sure. But, um, he's also the mayor of our city and he's, he's, I mean he's a bit of a goof and he's a bit of a bully I find as well. But it's funny to listen to the conservative pundits cause they've got to turn themselves into paroxysms and back twist to try and defend his behavior basically. And it gets more and more difficult to kind of defend the behavior of a man who keeps doing more. And more interesting kind of a WHO's trying to defend him. Wow. Really? Once you've planted your well, conservatives, I feel like I am more liberal, so quite liberal. Uh, so once, I think once a conservative or liberal, but once you plant your stick in the dirt, you just gotta keep, you gotta keep holding onto that stick even though the wind is blowing you like straight back.

Speaker 3:          00:45:14       Yeah. And one of the, one of them was like, well, I mean, you know, he's getting, he's getting videotaped all the time by, you think he'd be hanging around, you know, I can't believe his friends are videotaping. It's like he's hanging around with drug dealers. You can't really expect a drug dealer not to do something that may or may not profit them in some way. So anyways, but you know, and of course, you know the one talking head says that another one. Yeah, that's, that's true. I never looked at it that way. So then suddenly that becomes an arguable point that they can be like, yeah, he's getting victimized again.

Speaker 6:          00:45:43       That was the argument about Donald Sterling. Oh God. Y'All know his clippers. Yellow's the argument like, Hey, the guy's getting illegally wire tapped. You know, we'll give him a give him a up.

Speaker 3:          00:45:55       Yes, that's right. He didn't know. He's just an old doddering old man, which yeah, true enough. I feel, I heard some argument that he was actually asking her to tape him because yes, he felt like his head was going to tapioca and he couldn't remember anything anymore. So he's like, please take me. So that I remember all the things that I say apparently that's the truth. Yeah. That was actually part of her job wire tapped himself basically.

Speaker 6:          00:46:14       Yeah. And her job was to tape their conversation so that he would remember what they talked about. So like there were certain issues that he had to clear up and certain things that he had to do. She was apparently employed by him in some sort of a Pr Sassy. Yeah. Yeah. So it's funny because even discussing it like w d like what does this guy have a right to privacy? People were like, I can't believe you're supporting him. Like there's so many fucking morons out there that have the ability to comment on anything that gets discussed. Like you can't think of the guy's thinking is reprehensible, but yet think, hey, why is this? Is it, why is it okay to just listened to a private conversation that this guy's having because somebody recorded it and then find him for that private conversation. I don't think it is. I don't think it's,

Speaker 3:          00:47:00       you're right. I mean, I'm, I, these are one of, you know, you've heard this a lot of times and of course you have to separate what he said and the reprehensible, clearly the longstanding, reprehensible nature of this man has, he's, you know, sort of proven to be over like 20 year span. And then of course the question is, and it's been asked already, why, why is he still in that position where everyone knows he was, uh, a racist dirt bag, but no one was, you know, doing anything about it. And I think at this point they got, the players basically pushed it. They said, listen, if you don't get rid of this guy, we not come out

Speaker 5:          00:47:29       and play anymore. And apparently it got to that point, he also represents a very unsavory aspect of our culture. Yeah, that's right. So it's important to take a stand and say, hey, this guy's got to go. What I didn't get, the thing that puzzled me the most is that they find them two point $5 billion for a conversation that he had in his house. Like I don't see that standing up in court. And he is, he's a litigious dude, so he's going to sue the fuck out of that. They're going to lose so much money. They're going to lose millions of dollars because they tried to find him two point $5 million to make a point. They're going to lose so much money. And I had, I wondered a conversation too, you know, because now the value of that team is up in the air. Like what does it, what does it work?

Speaker 5:          00:48:10       You know? And I think, I think it's going to be worth more because once they, if they make them sell it, you know what I mean? Because then it's almost like Tabula Rasa, we can redo it. It's like we're getting rid of this old troglodyte and you know, who knows. It might be like black ownership who comes in? Magic Johnson, Magic Johnson. I think Oprah Winfrey was sort of in chosen. She was, that was all just nonsense. Okay. Um, but yeah, magic Johnson would be the, cause he was one of the ones who was actually insulted deeply. Plus he has HIV. It's even better. Right? He's got everything's good. He loves Jesus. Get them in there and x Laker. Yeah, he's perfect. He's great basketball player. And he was one of the ones that I think she was a in trouble for taking photos with. That's right. That's, and that's what sterling brought it up.

Speaker 5:          00:48:54       He was like, do we really have to have you taking pictures with Magic Johnson? Dumb. But it's an interesting, you know, it's, it is, it is an end. It's amazing how quick it blew up to me. Like I just saw it on some website and I thought, well, there's just an old dumb white guy saying old dumb white guy things. But it was much more clearly, much bigger than that. Well if it was something else, like say if he was safe, he was a president of a company, a big company, General Electric or something like that. And he had a little piece on the side and he was like, Hey, stop taking pictures of black eyes. It wouldn't get nearly the response as someone who has benefited tremendously from black athletes. Right. That's right. The amount of money that that guy has made because directly because of the work of black athletes, it's got that whole slave owner type quality to it.

Speaker 5:          00:49:43       You know? And there were, there were rumors that, you know, back in a couple of years ago, he'd gone into the dressing room and all the, you know, basketball players had been in various stages of undress. And he's like, I like seeing all this, you know, black, black flesh, you know what I mean? Sort of a thing. So he said to a woman, he brought a woman, oh, is that how a locker room? And he was saying, look at all these beautiful black box. Right. That's the exact quote. Yeah, yeah. Who knows? Yeah. I think things like that are going to spiral and all sorts of direction and you can, you can quote things that may, he may or may not actually say, but I mean the guy does, you know, at a certain point it's like you've opened Pandora's box, my friend. Well he didn't even mean to no so dumb and old, right? Can't remember shit. No. So Pandora's box sorta opened the belt on its own. That's right. Do you think though that as a writer

Speaker 4:          00:50:28       for like studying a guys like that, do you actively do that? Do you actively like watch how a guy thinks he sort of absorb his stupid thinking? I certainly find, I've done it more in magazine articles. I've wrote like profiles, you know, of of people. But I've used that to move into, into my fictional work too. So like, um, you like if it was a basketball player, say that you were falling around, you would try to climb into their mind, shadow them. Really like you physically shadow them and what does your day, can I, can I follow you? And of course that's up to the level of how much they're willing to have you basically dug their heels for as long as they're there. But I mean the more you can do that, the better it's the better the actual article is going to be depending on if they want that or not.

Speaker 4:          00:51:09       But like the, um, the MMA fighter I followed obviously he was just an amateur guys. His name was Ryan styles. Uh, and, and he actually only had one fight and was up in red deer. So like Calgary and then red here's about two or three hours away. And it was like in a, a civic center sort of a thing. And uh, but he was really, his father is great story, man. I find the best stories sometimes are where you don't quite make it, you know what I mean? Like athletically, it's like you put your heart and your guts and your soul into it and you're just not quite good enough. Right. You know what I mean? There's something about you, you just can't quite get over the hump. You know, I think I find those are the stories that are the most hit my heart, the strongest, you know, and his father is on the Calgary Swat team now, but he was, uh, had pat played forever in the, in the junior league of hockey and he made it up for a cup of coffee with the leafs for like two games, but he played professional hockey for two games and his son was like an an incredible wrestler, sort of had, you know, had the classic sort of MMA pedigree and uh, but he drove a, uh, like a sandwich truck.

Speaker 4:          00:52:10       Do you know those things? They go around to work sites and you know, a, I like a catering truck. And so I followed him for like three or four days on that job and he actually said that he let people take things on credit, you know, and so people would build up like a hundred, couple hundred bucks before they paid it off. Finally. And one guy, I guess like just, you know, we went to a Kim mechanic shop and he was like, it's so and so here. It needs to settle as bill. He's like, no, he went up, he's like a wildcat are now up in Fort Mcmurray, like 10 hours away. He just bailed. He just left in the middle of the night. So Tony, you know, who has a, has a, had a wife and a young kid got in the car, I went up and found them and uh, and, and got his money back, you know, so I mean, this is the sort of mentality that this guy had.

Speaker 4:          00:52:50       So, so when I think I got a pretty strong story out of that just by being able to stay with them long enough, he was really nice to speak to me, talked to me, and you got in borrowed inside of his head. Um, and I think the strongest work comes from as close as you can, can get to those people, you know? Yeah. Isn't it fascinating that we have this deep, deep connection to towards people that really are never going to realize their goals. It's a painful, I feel the same way myself. You know what I mean? It's like I've always felt like the mountain goes up and up and up. You got to, if you're going to hit your point on it at some point and you gotta be happy with that spot where you are in the mountain, whenever you, whenever you reached that spot. I think that's the biggest part in life really is just accepting your spot on the mountain wherever it happens,

Speaker 6:          00:53:33       be well. It's also the, the real issue with putting all of your eggs in one basket and that basket being athletics and especially athletics, especially combat athletics, the idea that you're going to have some sort of a long and successful fruitful career by throwing your bones and another person trying to separate themselves from their consciousness. That's quite ridiculous because just the very act of doing it in preparing for that very active to the amount of damage that your body and your brain even endures is. But we have this idea in our heads that, you know, a guy has to be an undefeated champion and then, you know, my son's going to be a champion some day. Like, man, if you're really lucky, your son won't be a champion. If you're really lucky, your son will learn the valuable lessons of martial arts as far as like character development and the, as far as your ability to overcome what seemed to be unsurmountable obstacles. But to become a champion, you have to be a crazy person. You have to be crazy person who's obsessed with nothing but that and that will take over your life.

Speaker 4:          00:54:40       Yeah. And I feel like having worked Avi obviously with people like that, you know, shadowed them and recognizing that mindset. Um, uh, I, you know, and I find too, like there's just some point at which like there's some gifts that are just bestowed by genetics or something, and it doesn't matter how hard you work, you're not going to quite get to that. Maybe that level that separates the real, and you won't know that until you hit it. You know what I mean? You're not going to know that wall until you run into it. And I feel like for some people, like I was talking to one guy, just a guy at the gym and, and uh, he said something more or less like the best that he, he ever felt in a fight was when he was up against someone he knew was better than him and he knew he was going to lose.

Speaker 4:          00:55:23       And if they fought a hundred times, he'd lose a hundred times. But he tacked guy, he made that guy see something about himself. He got that close to him that the other guys sort of recognize I'm a frail, I made out of the same crumbling stuff that he's made out of. And so, you know, sort of pierce that Teflon armor that, that I think some fighters carry around with themselves and he's like, that's, that's all I could do. That for me is the victory. I still lost. But I made that guide, discover something about himself that he hadn't discovered up until that point because he'd never been tested to the point that I got to. I wasn't able to test them. And I thought that's another part about just being, recognizing what you're able to do. You know, and it may not be beating them, but it's you, you find some other measure of success.

Speaker 6:          00:56:05       That's fascinating because to me, if you say that someone can get so close, they could test someone, that means that they could beat him. They just have to figure out what it is they did wrong and going out again and work harder. That's where the madness lies. Yeah. Maybe that's it, isn't it? The madness lies in the preparation. The madness in the trying

Speaker 5:          00:56:24       to like what separates a champion from someone who was just very good. Well, from my personal experience involved in martial arts competition, there's a level that some people are just not willing to push themselves. Is that it really? Yeah, it's a big part of it. And then outside of that, there the other variables or genetics. Psychology, some people have, some people have a different psychology. What's really interesting is people that have been bullied, um, and especially people that have larger brothers that, that bullied them in the house their whole life. Those are the scariest fuckers on the Braille. It's like GSP I think was bullied and he was now. But yeah, he Weidman was bullied. Jon Jones has a good relationship with his brothers, but he has a giant brother who was way bigger than him. His brother Arthur is a beast. He's a pro football player and he fucks John up all the time whenever the rest of today still fuck.

Speaker 5:          00:57:14       Yeah, he's huge. So because of that, I think that John grew up with this just super athlete brother and he ain't afraid of shit. It doesn't seem like it. Yeah. Cause fucking brother's a month. Any, he was sort of what an imprinted them at such a young age too, you know. I mean I think that's it too. You get these things impressed on your flesh at a young age and you don't forget those lessons. Yeah. Brothers are a big one, man. It's usually, for whatever reason, the younger brother, that's the real beast because the younger brother and doors, the beatings at the older brother gives him and because of that it develops this sorta steely determination. It's quite frightening. I could totally see that. That's totally makes sense. Both on a physical level, but on an emotional kind of, um, you know, you're getting that adamantium kind of mindset about things and just got to keep prevailing.

Speaker 5:          00:58:00       I've always thought to like, because I do watch a lot of MMA and, and I, I love it both as a sport and boxing as well, but also like the psychological aspect of it really fascinates me and I've, I've always felt like how painful it must be to come up. I always think about like Michael Jordan and who were, you know, we would think differently of Dominique Wilson, w Wilkins if Michael Jordan ever existed. And I think we think differently of so many fighters if GSP hadn't existed or, or Silva or, you know, Jon Jones, these sort of long reining sort of champions. Um, and, uh, and, and I, I, you would know better having been been through it, but there's, you know what I mean? There's that next level who can't quite, you know, they have their one shot, they can't quite clear it. And some are lucky to have another op opportunity at as sort of Gulf go back at it and can still make a good career for themselves.

Speaker 5:          00:58:49       But I find that MMA, especially in the UFC right now, is there's some long reigning champions and the peep, and that's what people love. You know, they sort of love, but all the focus is on them. And then these people think the guys underneath who could be awesome, where it not for, for a GSP. That's the whole purpose. I knew champion. That's right. Dominant other over other savages. Yeah, that's, that's the thing about the being the second best guy who could have been a champion in any other era. That's gotta be so mad. I wouldn't it be, yeah. A junior dos Santos is a good example of that. People always compare jr junior, junior dos Santos was the champion. He knocked out Cain Velasquez. Right? But it was at a time where Cain Velasquez was injured. He tore a ligament in his knee. His knee was all fucked up.

Speaker 5:          00:59:37       He didn't have good mobility and junior caught him with a big punch. Then they fought two more times and Cain destroy them. Freedom from pillar to post probably took years off of his life with those beatings. I had friends who were martial artists and fighters and you know, either former pro fighters are guys have been involved in fighting their whole life. Who universally texted me and emailed me and said, dude, that fight took years off that guy's life. They could, they just felt it even watching, especially the second one, the, the, the, the, the uh, the third one rather than the last one. The um, the second rematch, just unbelievable. Beating the Canaan. Canaan, he doesn't knock you out. He just malls you and, and really just reduces you in some terrible way. Well, he keeps a pace. It's almost inhuman for a heavyweight and heavyweight for 240 pound man to keep up with him.

Speaker 5:          01:00:29       Good fucking luck. It's probably not going to happen. And a lot of that's genetic. Like I talked to Bob Cook, who's his trainer. He said that guy could go a couple of months outside of training, get injured, be out for a couple months, then come back in and out work. Everybody just doesn't get out of shape and you, wow. Mexicans are kind of known for that. There's some tough fight boxers too. Like it's a, it's a, it seems like a tough culture. Fuck Mexicans. I think some of the grittiest toughest fighters of all time. I totally MMA or boxing the N in during endurance to their stamina. It's just shocking and they just, they don't stop. They don't, you're right. They're sorta just like, you're going to have to hit me with a house like Julio, Cesar Chavez. You remember when that guy has to fight? He would just ding. The Bell had rung ring and he just start moving forward, throwing a barrage of punches that will never end until you drop.

Speaker 5:          01:01:20       And he fought like didn't he have an enormous record in terms of like I thought like a hundred fights or something and more than that he had 197 fights before he ever suffered a loss. Yeah, that's, that's how it was. [inaudible] 97 and Oh, you ever saw for careers of some other fighters, you know, in terms of overall records or, sure, yeah. Yeah. So yeah, that's, I mean a lot of fighters today in this day and age don't fight nearly as many times as they used to back in the day. Like a guy like Floyd Mayweather who's like 45 oh 46 and oh I think 46 in our laughter, that's unbelievable. Like, but 97 and oh that's so insane. 97 fights period, you know, and that's right before he hit a loss. And then I feel like, I could be wrong, but I feel the wheels fell off. That's actually the, one of the quotes is, you know, like on a long enough timeline.

Speaker 5:          01:02:08       Any, any fighting stories? Usually it can be a tragic one. And I find that happens less than MMA. I feel like guys, no one to retire better in MMA than inboxing. I feel like people hang onto the rope a little too close. That was true. I wish it was really think it is. No, no. Chocolate. Dell definitely didn't. And I was almost going to mention chuck Liddell was like, because he did get rocked his last couple of fights and that it's made some. Yeah. Yeah. Well not just that. The only reason why I stopped fighting was Dana White because Dana just said that's it. Yeah. Dan is very close with them and said, I see what's going on here and maybe you don't because you're the fighter. You got to stop. The thing about fighters is they have this belief in themselves and it's just, it's never ending and unflappable and especially the champions.

Speaker 5:          01:02:50       They always think, I know everybody's count me out, but I'm gonna figure out a way to beat this motherfucker. They go into that ring with that determination. Yeah. And that's what made them a champion in the first place. But that's also what that fails them. When, when it comes down to like objective thinking and being introspective about your abilities and how much you've diminished, it's that sort of bulletproof belief in themselves that winds up fucking them over. Yeah. And I think it's also too there. They're young, right? I mean comparatively, I know my, when my dad retired, uh, it was like a trap door open under his life in a way because he was like used to having this routine to his life and you look forward to it. But I think, you know, the first week you're like, oh, this is great. And then the second week it's like, what the, what the hell am I doing?

Speaker 5:          01:03:34       I feel like my, and then if you're looking down the barrel of that, when you're at 60, 65, well that's one thing when you're looking down the barrel of that, when you're 32, 33 something like it's gotta be a different, this is what I was, this is what I'm good at. This is all I'm good at. I think some of them might think and, and then it's like, God, I've got a long existence ahead of me doing what? What am I doing next? And nothing is ever going to match the thrill. The fighting will never feel that or I'll never feel something like that. You know what I mean? I feel like that must be, I don't know if you've talked to fight, did they ever, are they good at describing what that feeling is like? Well, I think the only person that's ever going to truly understand what it's like to say like be Jon Jones and enter into a world championship fight with the whole world watching cage door shuts and the Bruce buffer, it's time.

Speaker 5:          01:04:22       They're the only ones that will ever understand that. I will never understand it. I've watched and I've done commentary and more than a thousand right in the ring. You're when the endorphins are still there. When the fuck's going on, I'm completely outside and I've competed. I've kickbox and of course, yeah, probably a hundred taekwondo matches. Doesn't matter. I just don't know what's going on when that's happening. I just, I can't imagine. I literally can't imagine. Do you think it's a different level than cause I mean, I mean it's a different level in some way in the fat and the, in the sort of the crowd response in the idea of how many eyes are on you. But I mean when you stepped in or even when I've done fighting, it's still you and another guy. So I wonder how far removed is our experience. You know what I mean? Pretty far assume it is. Certainly in terms of, but I mean I felt like I was amped up to the point where every one of my synapsis was screaming. I'm just not built to do that. You know, maybe they have, maybe there's a calmness. I feel like sometimes you look and they're the top fighters

Speaker 4:          01:05:18       are able to kind of establish a certain calmness that, that I, I've never really found. And when in those situations in my life, whether it's a playground scuffle or, or you know, an amateur boxing match, well the calmness,

Speaker 6:          01:05:29       a lot of it comes with the experience itself being something that you recognize and you've been there before and you know how to deal with it. Whereas someone who has never, like if you took a guy who has never competed at all before and you throw them in a UFC fight, they would fucking shit their pants. Yeah. Especially if they didn't know how to fight at all and there's so many things to deal with, it would be overwhelming. They probably have a heart attack. Yeah. But if you take a guy like a Jon Jones, because we keep talking about him, trains his whole life in a wrestling. So he's wrestled for many, many years, competed a very high level in wrestling, then started competing in MMA trains every day, constantly in the gym, constantly working out with these really high level guys. It becomes, you have a comfort level with like just the recognition of what this is.

Speaker 6:          01:06:19       You understand it, you get in there, you know what you can do, you're very aware of what you're capable of because you have literally pushed yourself to your limits and training and you get in there and you're much calmer than a person who's completely alien to the experience. So I think for you like doing it a couple of times, like you didn't have a chance to get used to it. No, not, there's a lot of guys who do, who are probably similarly gifted or not gifted, not gifted as the way a lot of not gifted guys go very far.

Speaker 4:          01:06:49       Just through hard work and determination and yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          01:06:52       What they don't ever do is beat the great ones. No, that's the difference. The not gifted guys can have great careers. They can get a lot out of the competition. They can become coaches, they can train fighters, they can, they can become commentators. They can do a lot of things, but they can never figure out a way to beat the

Speaker 4:          01:07:11       great one. No, no, no. I feel like that's, um, in my experience watching as well, there's that kind of, that's, that's a separation level. It's, it's as much as your heart and your talent. And there there is, you know, hearts is something that is one of these ephemeral qualities that no one, but I mean there is there, I mean there are fighters that, you know, that's what they have. That's what's getting them through. It's not necessarily they're talented. They're, I think heart is a combination of a lot of things that are kind of impossible to quantify. But you can, you can see it in, in different athletes. Doesn't have to be a fighter that seems to be where it's most obvious to notice it. But there's lots of athletes that I like and, and usually it's because they have some quality of heart that distinguishes them in my eyes. And it's, they're not the best, but they're just there. But they've taken their skills as far as they can go. Well that's why everybody loved Arturo Gotti and make you worse. Of course, those are the, that's a classic to heart guys going up against.

Speaker 6:          01:08:05       Never quit. You can beat them up, you could knock them out, you could stop them, but there will was never what

Speaker 4:          01:08:11       faltered. No, no, absolutely. And it had, they had more uh,

Speaker 6:          01:08:16       yeah. Who knows what their limit would have been necessarily or have they have trained more intelligently repeated, more intelligently. I mean a lot of that. What, what is talent, you know, we'll, it's the approach that you take. If you look at the way Arturo God, he moved and punched, he was very talented. He was, wasn't it? Yeah, most likely that he probably just wasn't trained correctly or to the best of his ability. You know, if you got a guy like a manual steward who gets a hold of a boxer from the time that he first starts and teaches him just incredibly perfect technique, perfect strategy. The mindset, like a customer, what he did with Mike Tyson molds his mindset. You know, you can, you can do something that if the guy grows up with some, you know, Midwest boxing club in the middle of nowhere with a guy who doesn't really know how to box and that's the guys teach him. That's the guy brings it through his amateur career. And that's the guy who turns him into a pro. That guy might be lacking and just giant chunks of knowledge that a guy like say a Freddie Roach has. Yeah. Yeah. You just, you, you never know what would create a champion out of a contender. Yeah. Sometimes it's just the, it's the, the mentor he runs in.

Speaker 3:          01:09:26       Yeah. I think that, I think that's, and I, I feel like that's true. Yeah. And also even mid fight, you know, because Gaddy was so many UCM sell drawn into firefights when he didn't need to, you know, and, and, uh, whether he's really listening to his trainer at that point or not, I don't know. Um, but I know for me to even, even the amateur, uh, things that I did, what I, what I really took away from it and what I really enjoyed was that was the training part of it. You know, I trained, um, I was living in Iowa at the time and, uh, there was, uh, a boxing club at the bottom of like a really sort of, it was at the bottom of a gold's gym and Coral Hill, which is sort of like, just outside of Iowa city. And, uh, it was run by a coach and to two girls to a female fighters, the Kleinfelter sisters.

Speaker 3:          01:10:09       And they were like one 30, one of them was maybe one 30. One of them was like one 15, tough, I mean, tough as nails fast and you'd, you'd spar. Like I knew I was going to have to get in this amateur boxing match. And so I was like, well, don't you better not let be easy on me and I don't, I did not going to be able to really punch a girl. I didn't think, you know, and I, I ultimately, I wasn't able to, but even if I wanted to punch them, I don't think I would have really been able to lay leather on them because they were fast and they were mean. And they were, uh, and even if I did touch them, they'd be like, you know, you, you punch like a softy. Like this is weak, weak ass shit. Uh, so, so, but what I really took away from it is really enjoying the, uh, the discipline, you know, with nutrition and with the roadwork. I mean, I could, I did all that stuff. I love doing that. And I felt like that was the only thing that I could actually take into my own hands and that I had some sort of, um, agency in, you know what I mean? I can run as hard and as far and I can, I can hit the bag for, until my arms feel like noodles. That's all that I can do. And you'll see a direct, improve your skills. But also

Speaker 4:          01:11:14       there was a limit. Like, I mean, and the one thing that I noticed, and I've said it before, is like, and I feel like other people have noticed this because I've gotten a lot of fights when I was young, but I don't think I ever won one. And I feel like I must exude this kind of waft of something that like I just am not a fighter, but every time I've gotten in a fight, it's been more that someone is, I feel like it's taking, trying to take advantage of me or has been picking on me for a long period of time. And it's the only way that this is going to stop or have been or have been picking on someone that I cared about. And, and I always got the sense afterwards that the person who beat me up basically a new, what?

Speaker 4:          01:11:50       New? That they're like, they, I can draw Davidson into a fight and I'll, and, and he'll, he'll willingly go in, he'll go into the bear trap, and then I'll just be able to beat him up. And the only good thing about it ultimately is that they, the picking on stuff stopped, you know what I mean? But I had to take a beating in order to sort of affect that, you know? Yeah. That's a weird psychological sort of a relationship between the bully and the, the person who gets picked on. Yeah. Yeah. But I feel like, and I feel like the real true fighters wouldn't even do something like that. They would recognize why, you know, this guy, or I'm not going to bother with this guy. I mean, I have mother. Yeah. I mean, May, may, I don't know. Maybe, maybe there are some writers who like to beat the shit out of people.

Speaker 4:          01:12:33       Yeah. Yeah. You've, I'm even noticing fight sometimes I feel like that guy looks like he probably might have, would be happy to be beating up someone with far less skill. He taking as much delight in it as he is. Usually they'd been abused. Is that so, yeah. I believe that's a big part of, uh, a lot of what, what constitutes a bully is physical abuse. You know, that they've been abused either at home or they've been abused by other kids and they're trying to lash out and get theirs. Now they've sort of taken on the role of the bully because they've been bullied so much. That happens a lot. I could see that. I actually, here's the, here's the sort of a story of my, one of my worst beatings. Uh, I was at the YMC hey, me and my brother were playing basketball. That was probably like 16, 17, eight times my, of my last year of high school probably.

Speaker 4:          01:13:20       And these two guys come and say, let's, let's play two on two. So we did, and back then I probably weighed like two 40. I was, uh, I was a big fat dude, you know, I just tee it 40 in the high school. Yeah, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe two 30, like I was enormous, but it was not a, it was not a healthy weight obviously. What do you weigh now? One 75, one eight or something like that. So that's partly the whole boxing stuff. And we do tree planting a lot up in Canada. That's sort of like what you do at university. You just go up to the woods and plant trees and that. I shed a lot of weight that way, uh, during, during university. But so I was a big beast, you know, and I sort of knew how to use my body and the guy that I was playing against was maybe one, one 60.

Speaker 4:          01:13:59       Um, so we were getting close to beat them and I turned around and I see the ball, it's whipping right at my face. He'd thrown it at me and I turned my head and it sort of goes by the side of my head and just, you know, it gives me a scalp basically. And then he's, then he's charging right at me. Like to get in no fight. Um, and there was no pro prior product? No, none at all. That's the thing. I mean, this guy, just a basketball, just a basketball game and, and, and, okay. It's in the why. So I'm like, okay, well we're not going to have a fight right in the middle of the why. I think I'm going to be okay. That's, I mean, I didn't really want to get into a fight, but again, this guy's throwing a basketball. I mean, it's pretty shitty move.

Speaker 4:          01:14:34       So anyways, this guy comes out, he's gotta be like 80 years old. He's like one of those guys at the y that was like a retired gym teacher and they sort of said, okay bill, you can just hang out around here and keep order. That's the be nice of you to do that. So he comes out and he's got a whistle around like an old p whistle around his neck, knee. He says, take it outside. I'm like, I don't, the last thing I want to do is take this outside, but, and, and, and he says, that's it guys. You take this outside. So I'm like, Oh, I'm sort of like being shoe horned into going out to having a fight with this guy. So I'm going down the hallway and my brother is, he should, he's massaging my shoulders cause I guess he thinks that's what he should be doing.

Speaker 4:          01:15:14       You know, that's how little we know about fighting. You know what I mean? He's, my brother was like, well I guess I've seen this in rocky. I should keep him, keep him limber and you know, he's like, you're, you're going to be fine. And if I, but I had a chance to look in his eyes, he'd be like, you are, you are, you are fucked. You know what I mean? And I, I think I knew that too. So I ended up outside, it's winter in Canada and there's ice on the, on the, on the sidewalk. And you know, I, I face up and what I assume is somewhat somewhat of a fighting posture. And he kicks me in the head. It's the first thing he does just like kicked me right in the head. And I'm not even sure what that will happen. I'm still standing, you know, and they need does it again.

Speaker 4:          01:15:52       And then I'm like, Oh God, this is not, this is not good. So he had martial arts training. Yeah, definitely. And then, you know, there was a bike rack. And I remember he like rang my, my head off of it and I'd get them in a, you know, sort of a headlock. And, uh, and I remember being like face down and there's like ice melts on the street, you know, that those blue crystals they put down, you know, and I'm, I'm, my face is pressed into it and thankfully it goes on for a while. Clearly I'm, I'm beat. And he's like, are you, are we, are we had enough here? I'm like, yeah, I mean, I've, I've had enough. That's enough. So he goes back inside chuckling with his buddy. Um, I'm sitting out there on the street bleeding. I don't even want to go back into the why, you know what I mean?

Speaker 4:          01:16:30       I'm going to have the people inside going, what the hell happened? Do you need help? And I'm like, I just want to crawl into a hole and, you know, not see humanity for about a month. Uh, so my brother goes inside, gets my clothes, we go, I find out later, this guy, we lacrosse is a big sport in our, in our country. And he was like the enforcer on the Lacrosse Lacrosse team, like the triple a Lacrosse team. So he was a tough guy. Like I didn't have a chance. You know right from the get go, I didn't have a chance. And then, you know, I discover his name cause we lived in a small town. And you sort of, these things sort of come to you, uh, as time goes by and then, um, my buddy calls me up, but a couple of years later he says, did you hear about so and so?

Speaker 4:          01:17:11       I said, no, I was away at university at this point. He's like, they went camping in the woods and hit him and his dad. And this word gets back to your idea of abuse. He stabbed his dad 44 times, killed him, killed him in the woods and they caught him just walking down the street with the knife in his hand. And, uh, and you know, later on the interview, his mom and his mom was like, yeah, he was, uh, you know, he basically would sit out on the porch saying that he, George Bush was going to come in air force one anytime, pick them up for some top secret mission. So we clearly had some, some mental instabilities that didn't present themselves at the age at which at least they were maybe emerging, but later, I mean that part had never been been into, I'm not, I can't really comment on that, but I mean, I, I don't know, but I think I feel like he stabbed the man 44 times. He would have to be a really heated argument and if they had no prior sort of history with one another, I don't, I don't really know. But first of all that he stabbed him and then he stabbed him that many times. Holy Shit. Yeah. And I thought a thought later, like, man, as bad as I got it, I mean, I could've gotten a lot worse. You know what I mean? At least he let me off at the end. He's like, all right, well

Speaker 5:          01:18:24       I always try to explain that someone who gives people the finger in a car, like you never know who you're giving the finger to. Exactly. My, my wife has a bad habit of honking the horn. I'm like, baby, I love you, but don't, don't do it. Don't do it. Don't you don't know who the hell is stepping out of that fricking car. You know, not only that, you never know what state they're in. They can be in the worst state of mind ever at the moment you lay on that horn, you could have caught them at the breaking point. Yeah. And that's what puts them fucking people. Especially in this day and age when you're dealing with cities and traffic and the unnatural stress of slamming 200 fucking million people together like this. Yeah. Yeah. They've done these studies on, on population density, um, just with rats and they've shown how bizarre rat behavior gets when you get too many rats and contained environment. And it mirrors human being's behavior as far as like human beings, when you have a small amount of them, you know, everybody seems to get along fine, but when you jam them together, you started getting all these mental illnesses. Well that's what they do with a, they get rats. If you have a certain amount of rats and you jam them into a, a box there, a certain amount of, and we'll just sit in the corner and start nodding their heads up and down and back and forth and then it gets really hard.

Speaker 4:          01:19:38       Yeah. Yeah. I found that same thing. I used to work at a place called marine land in Niagara Falls, which is like a seaworld.

Speaker 5:          01:19:45       Yeah. We had a guy I'm on that worked at marine. Oh really? Yeah, yeah. Was involved in, um, this fucking horrible situation with, uh, with dolphins and he had to the fuck is his name, Phil. Phil DeMaurice. Oh, Shit. You got him. I interviewed him for an article. I did feel dimmers. Yeah. Okay. Of course. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. And he was explaining us the smoosh it all

Speaker 6:          01:20:08       smooshy Walrus. Walrus, yeah. Yeah. It was also explained to us how intelligent these dolphins are and the dolphins go on hunger strikes. They have to force feed them and that they take them away from their mothers and they buy them from Russians. Yeah. Or really ruthless the way they, they capture.

Speaker 4:          01:20:23       Yeah. Yeah. I know it's, it's, it's, it's rough. It's rough stuff. Yeah. So anyway, you got, you got all that already from Phil and Phil was an insider. Phil was, Phil was there after I was there and I think things got some, I mean it was never a trainer either, but you know, some of the things that those guys are, the animal control guys saw was pretty rough. But that same thing as you perhaps so many animals and if you did the same to people, of course there's going to be like mania, disturbing, you know, depression, all sorts of stuff that we can sort of emote. You know, animals can only sort of just do it through their behavior. You get a sense of like this is not right, this, this rat is not in a good state. Well the zoo,

Speaker 6:          01:21:01       you ever go to the zoo and watch an animal just pace back and forth and they're small little container. Yeah. And you're like, this is nuts. I watched this bear once and he would just walk to one area turnaround, walk to the other, turn around and go back and forth. Like, that animal is going mad. They're good. They're going, Matt there, their animals like bears, they roam over miles and miles, countryside. And that's how their genes are sort of adopted. They're, they're adapted rather their, their whole being is adapted to this idea of nature, providing them with food. They go out and forge for the food. When they just stuck in his box and the food comes sliding under the door and a tray every day, all their reward systems are being rude up, just ignored or contain that some strange sort of a way and madness.

Speaker 4:          01:21:52       No, no, exactly. It, they, and they find other ways, you know, when you baffled all of those primal instincts. Mm. Um, and I think, you know, it's true. I, I, you know, we have a son and will we take them to the Toronto zoo? I mean, we might have to, where else can you see all of those creatures? You know, you can't just go out, you know, searching the forest until you find a bear. I mean you could. Um, but you, you do it with the understanding that no matter how nice the bear Penn is or the gorilla enclosure it, you can't, it can't do all the things that that gorilla, you just have to hope that they have a mind that is a bit more able to embrace their new situation. And some animals may be can, but other animals just like I'm built for this. And same, same with some men who were imprisoned. Like I'm not, you know, with the cool hand Luke sort of a thing. I'm not built for this. Yeah. It ain't happening.

Speaker 6:          01:22:38       Yeah, I agree. I, I, and I have children and I take them to the zoo, but the, is that feeling like I do it just cause my kids, I want them to explore everything, see as many things as possible. But this is part of me that feels like a big hypocrite because I don't want to support contain these animals. Yeah. Fucking penguin and it's 90 degrees out in la, like says fuck penguin. Thinking no one's going to be like, what am I doing here? What? How did I get here anyways? Like, why is it so lights went out and I'm, yeah, who's

Speaker 4:          01:23:05       this guy in the blue suit feed me fish and the fish are dead already. Yeah. Fuck what's going on? Well, even getting them to learn to do that, like I think a lot of animals just end up starving because they just won't learn to eat an animal that's not, you know, they're normally used to catching in some way. So you can't fake their enclosure. They can't, they can't embrace that much of a change.

Speaker 5:          01:23:27       Well, also the, the, the reality of zoo life is completely alien to the reality of an animal existing in an ecosphere. Yeah. Or in an ecosystem. So when an animal is in a zoo, that animal is separated from every other species, which never happened. No, no. Absolutely. Just so bizarre. And not only that, there's nothing trying to kill them. So they don't learn anything. No. All of their natural instincts to avoid predators, to sorta like sit there. They don't, they don't experience predators. Every monkey experiences. Predators, every ape experiences, cats in the wild there. There's no apes that live anywhere where there's not something that my fuck them up, whether it's a spider or a snake that they should avoid or something, and they have to learn. You learn to keep away from that snake. That's Nigga, fuck you. Yeah, but that's what keeps them sharp. Exactly what I mean. That's what gives them their lives purpose really. Even if it's just surviving well, it makes sure that the good genes pass on and in the zoo, it's just dumb monkeys walking each other. No one learns anything. They give free peanuts, just they just, that's what they're breeding and weirdest form of like animal prison ever. It's very strange.

Speaker 4:          01:24:40       No. Yeah, I mean I agree, but again, you got kids. I mean you do all sorts of weird things for your kids. I think sometimes zoos exist, but for the benevolence of of kids or the needs of kids so that, so that parents feel like, well shit, you're not going to see this any other way. I love you. I want you to see them. I'll gloss over. I'll say, oh, look at the happy monkeys. Even though in some part of you knows, these are not happy monkeys, the, this is not natural either. But you know, you're not going to take them to Borneo either. A natural monkeys. Yeah, exactly. Monkeys, you'll steal your name. I will eat your kid. Um, there's been stories of chimps stealing babies that's, oh, there was an awful article in Esquire where these two, you know, two people couldn't, couldn't have kids, so they, they get, get a chimp, you know, and the chimp, they raise the chimp like it's their kid and then they have probably had the gym for like 20 years.

Speaker 4:          01:25:32       One day the chimp goes nuts, tears her face off, basically. Like chimps are incredibly strong, powerful creatures and um, you know, basically, you mean she survived, but just barely sort of a thing. Um, and you don't recognize that, those sort of things. I think when I think of chimps, I think of that movie with Clint Eastwood. Uh, what every which way we're an orangutan, but, and those are probably even even tougher, you know? I mean, they're, they're bigger creatures, but they're less violent though. Are they? They're more subdued sort of a thing. Well, they'll still fuck you up. Don't dot

Speaker 5:          01:26:04       your i's and crossing the t's, but they don't actively seek out fucking up other animals. Chimps. Do chips have an instinct to go out and kill things? Sure. Yeah. Chimps. Chimps are not, um, they're not herb before us. Like a lot of people have this misconception. I had that up until this very moment. Predators, they eat monkeys, the monkeys alive. Oh, Jesus. Never seen that. Never too dark. That would be dark because they didn't heating a little version of themselves. Basically. God, well, they cannibalize as well. Oh, do they really? They murder other chimps and they cannibalize other chimps. They cannibalized chimp babies. I got chimps are the worst aspects of human beings, um, like in an animal form with intelligence and the I, but I think that is what makes people want to adopt them because it's the closest thing to us. That's not us.

Speaker 5:          01:26:55       You know what I mean? What's weird is that bonobos are close cousins and they don't exhibit any of that behavior. But what they do is they fuck each other like crazy. Oh, really? Everybody fucks. They fuck everybody. The father's fuck the daughters, the brothers fuck there. The, there are other brother. They fucked their sons. Everybody fucks. Really, it just like a big clan of, yeah, just uh, you know, sort of incest all over the, well, so much so that it's kind of clever on their part. They've avoided captivity because of it, because you can't have them in the zoo because they just fun. Right. People are like, we can't show our kids is fucking apes. Yeah. Go and go on. Add it all the time. Which is so weird. It's so ironic that you can, you know, you can have these animals doing everything in the wild except breeding.

Speaker 5:          01:27:39       We can't tolerate that show. Our children breeding. Yeah, exactly. They only have the like the hand as they want that or what does it, there's one group that they desperate to find them to hand as they're trying to get them to breed. The only thing that they do do avoid is the mothers will not have sex with their sons. That's the only one where it's verboten. Yeah, the Banabos have that one rule for whatever reason. The mother does not want to have sex with her son and that's it. But everything else is fair game. Everything else on the table and you won't ever see that in the zoo because they just are like, you guys just exist in the wild where we're okay, we're okay with our chimps and are gorillas and resolve conflict by fucking, yeah, so like sort of a prime like sort of like that's how they express dominance.

Speaker 5:          01:28:21       Kind of an idea that way. Or even like, I'm sure we argued here, but let's have, let's fuck around heroin. Everything's all right. You don't know. I mean I would probably have to study it a lot, but they do. Do a lot of chimp like things where they pick up branches and smack branches around and they'll pick up a large branch and they drag it on the ground to show dominance. Chimps do a lot of that. They do a lot of posturing with picking up large things, shaking trees. I'll shake things to show how strong they are. But chimps, we'll engage in like some serious violence. I was elbows. Yeah. Well maybe if you want to, I mean, I guess if you were into adopting it, the one part of that story, like you understand like you have kids, but you know, I have kids.

Speaker 4:          01:29:02       I think if you don't have kids and you've tried to have kids, I think people might feel that there's a loss in their life and something that needs to be filled. You know, and often you fill it with an animal, you get really into dog breeding or [inaudible] 17 cats or something like that. These guys decided to, chimp was the way to go. And I guess I would have thought like totally innocently that, yeah, okay. A chimp, whatever. You dress it up in a Tuxedo. And, uh, do whatever. It's a little weird, but I get the, I get why you're doing it. I know it's a replacement for the fact that you can't have kids, but then when this kid goes a feral on you basically and, and attacks you in a way that, um,

Speaker 6:          01:29:37       documentary about people that keep scary animals. It's called the elephant in the living room and it's supposed to be really good. I got an 82% on rotten tomatoes. I need to watch it, but it's a documentary about the raising of exotic pets in homes and, uh, how many knuckleheads in America wind up doing that? They, you know, they have, like, there was this thing the other day, I was watching this piece on this guy who has a pet mountain line, really bottle fed it since it was a baby. And you see at least in a sort of a remote area or, I don't know. I don't, I didn't pay attention off, but he's got this cat, he's had it since it was a baby and now it's a full grown 200 pound female cat and just like, yeah, okay. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:30:19       Hope that works out. Thank you. Are Juggling dynamite right here, my friend. But uh,

Speaker 6:          01:30:22       nappy, you know, I mean I don't know what I'm, some animals are cool with it, you know, as long as you feed them and your sweet with them. But yeah, the bottom line is it's always going to have that instinct to chase shit. If you roll a ball of yarn in front of a take a ball of yarn and toss it in front of a house cat, they fucking dive on that. Yeah,

Speaker 4:          01:30:39       yeah. Oh yeah. Total open. No, no, exactly like a laser pointer on the wall there. But yeah, there are bananas. You can't, that's their instinct, you know. So and we have one who comes home with all manner of like cats are, you can't beat cats for like Sorta, just like sadism. Oh, they've worked. Came home once. It was night and I was like, what do you got there in your mouth? And she opens her mouth and it was a baby mouse alive. She just cradled it in her mouth like, but I realized if I'd come five, she was just going to play with it until it either died of fright or punctual. Yeah. She chewed it up basically. So I think like a dog, a dog just goes and gets what it wants. Eats it. Most animals do. But man, a house cat especially cause they're, all their needs are covered. So it's like this is all just fun for me. My cat

Speaker 6:          01:31:20       grew up a mouse once. Ah, he had eaten it and uh, then just puked it in the living room. Yeah, that's rough. She, yeah. Yeah. Ours or ours or girls instead of a male cat too. But it wasn't a male cat that, that it was a female. She just barfed it up. Little mini mouse. Oh that's terrible. Cat Food. Narrow. Hairballs yeah. I'm like, oh you discussed monster fucking weird because they're looking at you like the parent and everything. I was rubbing up against you. Like they're so sweet.

Speaker 4:          01:31:49       But you think, man, if I was an inch tall, you would make sport out of me. You would make mince meat out of me and you would have no, not a goddamn care in the world.

Speaker 6:          01:31:56       No. No, no remorse. No, no remorse. All it was,

Speaker 1:          01:32:00       I enjoy reading, reading. Uh, it's just cut into this last week a reading Vegan forums on how to feed their cats and they almost all reluctantly have to admit that their cats need meat is CATSA very high protein requirements and much different than a human beings and much different even than a dog. He can, you can feed dogs like a certain amount of Vegan food and, and the vegans, do they say

Speaker 4:          01:32:27       we're, we're, this is a Vegan, Vegan household and it, that counts on our dogs and cats as well.

Speaker 1:          01:32:32       Do what? Their dogs. Wow. People get away with it with their dogs. They don't get away with it. The cat.

Speaker 4:          01:32:36       Yeah. That's just, there just wouldn't be healthy. You'd like mistreatment animals like this all day. I need some time, but this mangy looking for fallen out and oh, he's fine. He's just kind of going through a stage,

Speaker 1:          01:32:52       just reading the, the torment that these people have gone through before they make the decision to feed.

Speaker 4:          01:32:58       Yeah, I know, I can imagine. I can only imagine, you know, I had one to Iot, I was trying to do a, an article on, um, on pit bulls, which I thought would've been really interesting cause I, one thing I noticed it in research was like, people in different parts of this country breed pit bulls differently based on where they are from. Like Kentucky, Arkansas, they breed like a really lean, it's almost like fighters, like a really lean fast version of a dog. Whereas in, in California, uh, or sorry, Florida and Miami area, they be your breed, like really big, bulky kind of that sort of what the genes that they want to put together and yeah, for the purposes of, of fighting these creatures. Um, and I mean I, I, I like pit bulls. I've met, I've met not, you know, nice pit bulls, you know.

Speaker 4:          01:33:43       Um, but I do, I do know from what I've researched, any ways that they're like bred into, they're built to be fighting creatures that sort of what they were bred for it. Um, and not sort of what that's exactly what they were bred for. And so that sort of thing is always in there is, is in their DNA helix. It's sort of, it's sunk in there and uh, you know, you go onto these pitbull forums and you experience in the same way with Veg, like a very strong emotional kind of like, you don't understand, you don't get it. And I wasn't even coming from a perspective of like intolerance or hatred. I was just coming from a perspective of I just want it, would like to talk about it. Where do you go to a pit bull fighting forum and what wasn't fighting. This was what they do with this one was um, they in sort of like tracked your pulse for dogs.

Speaker 4:          01:34:25       Oh they hook them up to sledges and they see how much, how many bricks they can carry and, and that sort of like, I mean, I'd much rather that, right. Just like strength events basically for these dogs. But I, I, I, I sort of had the temerity I guess to, to say, you know, you guys, I hope I can see why you're doing this. You're sort of doing this because these dogs have these instincts and it's better to have them pulling a sledge then fighting, you know, fighting one another or fighting other dogs and you know, you're, you're just sort of assaulted by these people who are like, you don't get it at all. These are the nicest creatures ever. And I wasn't

Speaker 5:          01:34:58       even coming from saying there. They're not nice creatures. You know, I, I, again, I feel like a lot of it with animal ownership is the owner. It's really not the dog always, you know, a dog when it's born can go any number of different ways. But when you see a a pit bull owned by a guy who's driving around like a jacked up pickup truck and his dog's got like a spike collar on and he's carrying around by a links of know chain, you're like, that dog might potentially have been raised with a certain higher you. The aggression might've been brought out of a more than this dog that had grown up with the family with three kids in it, you know? Yeah, they can be good pets, but they're always dangerous. Run other dogs. Always. Almost always very rare that you get a pit bull that doesn't have animal aggression.

Speaker 5:          01:35:39       Just thousands of years of genetics. They're raised them to be aggressive and to fight other dogs. I love pit bulls as pets, but I won't have them just because it's a drag. Like your friend brings their dog over and your dogs don't play. They go to war, you know? Exactly. It's not exactly if it's two pimples, it's one thing. But if your friend brings over his black lab at ain't it ain't a fight. Not a fight. And I went, I did a, went into the SPCA and they just busted a ring and they had like 40 fighting dogs and they were so nice around the Spca workers, all the, but they end up having to, to destroy. Most of them were maybe all of them even because it's, it is, it's like having a, uh, a stick of dynamite with a fuse of indeterminate link that could blow up at any time, you know, and they just felt like you had been bred to this sort of utility and this is what you're good for and it's not your fault, but you're just, you're not safe out in general population.

Speaker 5:          01:36:32       And also, if they're not trained properly, can be very dangerous around children because they don't recognize children's adults. Uh, well they'll acquiesce to an adult's demands and requests. They look at adults as being the ones that are in control. They don't look at children along those same lines. They see something, their height and they just attack it. Ah, that's fucking really, Dang. It is. It is. And, and I mean, again, there's going to be people listening to this who are, or Pippo fanciers and they're going to, I've had a bunch of them. Have you? Yeah. Who have, who have had half had words about this or have they know I've had pit bulls, pit bulls yourself. I came home once. My dog had killed my dog in the living room. You're kidding. No, they went to war when I was gone. Jesus, believe me, man.

Speaker 5:          01:37:14       I'm, I'm, I love them as animals. I will never have them as pets. Not Anymore. Yeah. So you've got kids now too. Of course. I didn't have kids. I just deal with it, get it out and attack the neighbor's dog or something. That happened to my dogs. Dad got out of his yard, crawled into the neighbor's yard, attack the neighbor's dog and the animal control guys came over and killed it. It's fucked. It's like, first of all, it's fucked for the neighbor. You know, the dog's barking. Like dogs bark at each other and they're thinking, you know, Shit. Dogs like, oh, for real, fighting to the death of the, I'm already in your yard. It is to the death. That's the only way I know you with the guy in the basketball. You're like, Holy Shit, I'm, I'm up against the different breed of humanity. Right guys kicking me in the head.

Speaker 5:          01:37:59       Yeah. Nowhere. And you know, you're just trying to play basketball and your brother's rubbing your shoulders. Neither one of you know, what the fuck are you doing? How are totally neophytes and, and you know, and there was something, you know, this is probably way too like writerly, but there is something about the eyes of a guy like that and you're just like, oh, I'm, you know, you know, you're done before you're done. I haven't, no, you're done before. Hundreds of those dudes. Yeah. There's just something clockwork in around in their eyes like, and you're just like, oh no, no, no, I'm not, I'm not built to this standard. This is not going to work out too well for me. Yeah. There's guys that enjoy beating the fuck out of people. And like I said, a lot of them have had the fuck beaten out of them and it becomes, and that's one of the things that they say that's the most horrific thing about sexual abuse, is that a lot of the abused become abusers when they get older.

Speaker 5:          01:38:44       Exactly. It started like a repetitive of the sun. Ray expresses the sins of the father so dark. It's such a weird thing how it makes you realize too. Just how fortunate. Like I again, I know you, you spoke about your mom and you have a good relationship with your mom. I did a good relationship with your father as well. No, no. Terrible. Oh, I don't know him. He was a horrible guy. But my experience up until I was five years old, it was just him being really violent and scary to, to both you and your mom. Mostly to my mother. Not really to me, but uh, enough so that it was just a scary thing to watch. Yeah. Well, so, you know, I mean, I would just very fortunate you realize how

Speaker 4:          01:39:22       luck is based on so many things that just who your parents are, where, where you're born in the world. And uh, um, and uh, yeah, I didn't, I've been very fortunate that way, but I know friends who have had, you know, different situations so, but anyways, yeah, yeah. I mean it's just

Speaker 5:          01:39:41       get your hand in life. You do what with with it what you can, but some people's hand is just unmanageable and that is just the reality of being a human being. There are certain people that are just abused to the point of no return before they ever get a chance to try to sort their life out. I wouldn't even begin to know how to manage that. I wouldn't know what to do. And I know people that have, uh, adopted, uh, abused kids and you know, the kid is, they've had the kids since the kid was three and then the kids now a in kindergarten and fucked the gets fucked. No. In My, uh, my, my wife is out,

Speaker 4:          01:40:17       the child services social worker, which I mean, it's tough. It's tough. And she told me this one story, I can repeat it. Um, and she, she goes over with this, this other, uh, with a cop actually to apprehend these kids, opens the door, dirt bag. Father answers it. My kids aren't here, kids haven't been here for days. Uh, she's like, well, we have reports that your, your wife said that they are here because they're certainly not with your, your, your ex. And you know, basically they had a warrant. They got inside rooms, empty apartments, empty as far as they could tell. Closets, open closets, open a jar.

Speaker 5:          01:40:54       So they open it up to kids in there, in the closet. And the one thing that my wife noticed was it the wallpaper, I don't know who wallpapers the inside of closet, but whatever, it was ripped and rags and the kids had been eating anything because they had been in there for so long that,

Speaker 4:          01:41:10       that, that was sort of how it, how it came that way. They got to the point where they were, or they were eating the wall

Speaker 5:          01:41:14       paper listening to this podcast recently, that there's this podcast that I really enjoy called radio lab. And uh, one of the episodes or radio lab dealt with this guy. Um, the, the episode's called escape, uh, dealt, dealt with this guy who had spent his entire life in and out of jail. And it was about his, uh, his childhood and how he was sort of abandoned. He was raised by, I forget what relative, but they didn't feed them. And so him and his dog, his sister would eat paper at night just to fill their stomachs because they were an agony from hunger pains. Yeah, yeah. Do you know you, you read about shit like that and this, you know, this guy goes on this horrific cycle of childhood abuse and becomes as criminal and, and he wound up meeting this woman falling in love and actually having a family but still keeps fucking up and can't figure out a way to stop. And you hear it from the woman, you know, like the woman who married him. Her point of view of like what could he do? Look, I grew up like in this horrific state and he just, he's broken. He's a broken man. It's fucked.

Speaker 4:          01:42:22       And it's, yeah. It's like before we even had a chance really to make his own decision about some of these things. Um, yeah. Yeah. I know. I don't mean to be a Downer about any of this. Yeah. Yeah. As a writer. I that what I was gonna ask earlier, okay.

Speaker 5:          01:42:38       About watching things that you, you know, watching humans that you don't agree with or watching things, studying human behavior. When you do that, do you try to put yourself in the mind of the abused or the mind of the abuser? Like, do you try to put yourself into these people's heads to try to see what was like this guy who, you know, they found him and you know, he's saying like, no, my kids aren't here. And then they find the kids in the closet. Do you try to put yourself in

Speaker 4:          01:43:07       that guy's mind? No. Eight mean in that case, I put myself in the mind of the social worker because Ma, you know, it was easier to, for me to put myself in the mind of, of my wife rather than put myself in the mind of, of someone like that. You know what I mean? But even in the troupe, there's, there's a character Shelly who is, uh, you know, has some very serious things wrong with him. Uh, and um, so, so yeah, I think part of it is trying to put yourself as closely into that mindset as, as you can, um, while recognizing that you can never quite bridged that gap. You know what I mean? Cause cause I mean, that's just the leap that I can't quite make, you know, so you just have to hope that, that you're getting close enough that uh, that the reader is always said as, as a writer, you just need to be one step ahead of your reader.

Speaker 4:          01:43:54       It means you have to have done that a little bit more to more research or just spent more time thinking about these things that a reader, hopefully it's going to read really quickly and it's going to be like, okay, okay. It's not, nothing is really sticking out. That is enough. That's going to make them sort of checkup, which all people do in a book or a movie. They're like, okay, you've just, this is too far. You suddenly you've sort of cross some sort of boundary that I'm no longer quite with you in the way that I was before. Um, and you never know what it like. I was, I was, you know, having dinner yesterday at the hotel bar and ended up next to this guy talking to him and he was like a big Tom Clancy reader. And, and I said, Oh, I've had people, like I had a guy get in touch with me once.

Speaker 4:          01:44:33       Uh, cause I, I wrote some sort of book that had some military stuff in it and he was sorry, said, well, you know, um, and not to, not to be a nitpicker anything, but the, the clip capacity of an m 16 is actually 16 rounds and not 17, as you said. And I'm like, I get it. I mean, I get it. I get that. That's wrong. That's a mistake. Um, but I think probably the store, that's what I'm trying to do is not really having, it'd be great if I could have caught that and it was more scrupulous to fact, but really you're trying to weave a narrative and fiction, but some readers, that's what they want. They want to take this out of it. If you don't, exactly. If you don't get the facts right, if you don't, if you're doing something about medical stuff and you're not, you haven't been scrupulous about it, then, um, then yeah, then you're going to get, but I mean, the guy mentioned, he's like, that's why I can't read Stephen King because he gets apparently too many things wrong. And I'm like, I am so deep into most Stephen King narratives that I don't wonder what he gets wrong. I wonder that too. I, I, I sort of asked him and he wasn't able to, he wasn't able to say anything. It was just a generalized sentiment that's not who gets things wrong. There go much to be a dick, a wine. He might've been, he was, he was, uh, he was a defense contractor. He sounds like a dick if he can't tell you the exact

Speaker 6:          01:45:42       things that Stephen King got wrong, like any particular examples, he's gotta be a dickhead.

Speaker 4:          01:45:47       Yeah. Well, and sometimes you just find yourself faced up against so many said something like, well, uh, you know, fracking, you know, fracking. And he's like, well, I've done research and there's absolutely not a damn thing wrong with fracking. And it's a myth. Just like global warming is a myth. And I was like, oh, okay. I think we're probably on different sides of this and I'm not going to get into an argument with you about it, but that's where you just tune out of a conversation. He was like, oh, okay. I'm, I'm, I'm out of fracking or not a myth. No. I mean, people are light up their, their tap water. I don't know if you're seeing that, you know, people have been able to

Speaker 6:          01:46:19       do that. I've looked pretty deeply into it. People have been able to light up their tap water long before there was fracking. It is possible that, well water is getting, is getting the, they get contaminated, but the reality of contaminated, well, water's directly related to fracking is undeniable because they're, they're blown out the earth and then it's seeping through until the end of the, yeah. They're all, and they're getting better at fracking. They're figuring out a way to do it that's more efficient. But the reality is, you know, you've got to break some eggs to make an omelet and guys don't give a fuck. Yeah. They're trying to get natural resources out of the ground and they're not trying to not pollute. They're just doing their best to confirm, to conform to whatever regulations that get established. Yeah. That allow them to make money. And those regulations are directly influenced by the very companies that make fucking trillions of dollars. They own the politicians, they buy all the regulations. They make sure that everything is in place so that they can make money. Totally. I mean, there's definitely some damage that fracking has done. Did the question becomes, is it okay? Is it okay that this damage is done? Because there's a plus side, there's, there are employee. Yeah. There's a lot of natural gases and a lot of natural resources that we could harvest. And that's different question. Yeah. But the idea that it's a, it's a myth and there's nothing wrong with fracking. That guy's a dick.

Speaker 7:          01:47:40       Those, those

Speaker 6:          01:47:41       fucking right wing chatterboxes.

Speaker 4:          01:47:43       Yeah. Yeah. And it just come right out with it too. I'm, but then like two minutes of us talking, I'm like, wow, now suddenly I'm not getting into this where he's an idiot. He's an idiot.

Speaker 6:          01:47:53       The idea that global warming is a myth too. He's an idiot. Yeah. I feel like, come on. It's pretty well established and whether or not it's human influenced. There's, that's a debate that most scientists almost, I think it's some insane number, like 99% think that it's human influence and since he's not okay

Speaker 7:          01:48:11       fucking science, maybe you should shut is dirty hall.

Speaker 4:          01:48:16       Yeah. And I feel, I felt almost like a fuck, I hate to say Joe, but like a bit of a fraud that I didn't go up against them, you know, because you're like, I would've walked away. Yeah. You can't fight every battle. But there's a sense of like, cause that's the conservative thing is like to come right at you. And I feel like, well fuck if I don't, if I don't come back and say something, I've started just like let him believe that his point is valid for the perspective.

Speaker 6:          01:48:37       Nadian you're a liberal, you wear glasses.

Speaker 7:          01:48:39       I know fucking hates you or I, it was amazing. Even spoke to me in the first place and we spoke to you to correct you. Correct. You and Stephen King and he's fucking pussies are scared of fracking. You're worried about global warming. I'm going to buy land up in your country. Meanwhile,

Speaker 6:          01:48:56       you know, they don't understand that global warning. It changes both the cold and the warm though

Speaker 4:          01:49:02       cold gets colder. Yeah. That's one of the big arguments is like, well look at, look at w you know, you'd look at how cold it is now. We had a hell of a winter. Then understand it's like you don't, it's the fluctuations that are, what are the things you are need to be looking at, you know? But whatever. It's a, it's a worthless sort of thing to get into. You know, especially with this guy had to be like Donald Sterling's age. It ain't, it ain't worth fighting. It Ain't worth it. He's an old that point. You should have scared him and see if he'd give him a heart. Right.

Speaker 7:          01:49:28       Sorry. If he could

Speaker 4:          01:49:30       get his little fucking shit tickers going. Yeah. And enough of you with your defense contracting and your global warming denying. Ah, yeah. I know you just sort of feel like, well at least I don't think, I think you're too old to have too much of a sway in this other than your vote still counts as much as mine does. Talking to guys like

Speaker 5:          01:49:48       that, just to find out what makes them draw those conclusions. But what I'm always fascinated by is not on the show. You've got people who, you know, have contrary positions to what it, but you're able to engage with them, I think in a really, really interesting at way that's not terribly, it's confrontational, but it's not, I dunno, I didn't know how to describe it. Right. But I've seen you do it and it's a, it's a skill obviously. Yeah. Well, I, uh, I like to talk to people that have strong beliefs and systems and things rather to find out what were the, how their belief systems are formed. I want to know that if there's, is there a logical, rational sort of basis to their belief systems or is it just that they've sort of adopted this predetermined pattern, which is very common? Very much so.

Speaker 5:          01:50:34       Yeah. I had a conversation with a guy in Jujitsu class about global warming we was talking to, and he just, he's 24 years olds, a military kid, and he was, uh, someone else brought up global warming and the kid goes, it's a natural cycle. It's always habits and natural cycle. I go, you're not a scientist. I go, you're a scientist. You know, scientists show me your phd. You're a scientist. You're not a scientist. Right. I started mocking him. I go, listen, man, you're being silly. You don't know what the fuck you're talking about. Where'd you and where'd you get it? Just tell me where you got that mindset. Where did it come from? It's that no nonsense, right wing mentality. Yeah. They don't even question it. It's clearly what's really fascinating about it is that they're always supporting big business, but yet no one gets fucked over more than blue collar folks.

Speaker 5:          01:51:20       When it comes to big business, no one gets fucked over. When we start that too. It's like some, sometimes this outlook is actually the one that's most injurious to you in a way of of your own life and your own sort of happiness in a way. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. And I mean you, if you think about it, the people that are less educated for the most part or more likely to work for a company or need a company to employ them, those are more likely people that are going to get lower paying jobs. Those are more likely people that are going to need some form of public assistance or the possible, but yet those are the people that have this pull yourself up by your own bootstraps mentality and that the, these fucking welfare rats, they have all these crazy ideas in their head. Whereas the educated people who are more likely to be able to fend for themselves or more likely at least to have the possibility to have a higher paying job because of the fact they're educated, at least in theory or more likely to support public assistance or more likely to be against some of the environmentally destroying policies.

Speaker 5:          01:52:25       Yeah. Of of big businesses. It's real weird how people just sort of form these, these patterns that they lock into that, as you said, can be really against their own self interest and self benefit going forward. Um, but I don't know about you, but I found like as I've gotten older, like when I was in school, I was a total like lip, like almost as left as you could go,

Speaker 3:          01:52:46       as PC as you could go. And as I get older I feel like I come, I come to some sort of, not the center, I'll always be to the left, but you know what I mean? There's, there's certain things about liberal, you know, they get on my nerves as well. Like, I mean, and that's just, I feel like any fully rounded human being, it's not going to always be in one camp that's higher. Lee, you know,

Speaker 6:          01:53:05       the approach. I think I'm very much a conglomeration of liberal and conservative ideas. I found like more and more, well, there's an old saying, show me, I'm a young man who, uh, show me. I'm a young man who is not liberal and I'll show you a man with no heart. Show me an old man is not conservative and I'll show you a man with no brain. And it's that somewhere along the line you realize that people need a certain amount of difficulty in life. They need a certain amount of hardship and they need a certain amount of, they need obstacles and needed to overcome those obstacles. And when you set it up so that they never have to overcome obstacles, and you give them a consistent series of safety nets, they get lazy. And that is true. And that doesn't mean that all people on welfare are lazy or that welfare is only for the lazy.

Speaker 6:          01:53:53       That's ridiculous as well. But there's some lazy fucking people out there and not just lazy, Lazy Thinkers. There's just, there's a lot of weakness. And when you give people the lottery ticket, you know what happens? They fucking, they lose all their money and they fall apart. It's just people need to accomplish things. It's a part of the whole genetic sequence that has been sort of ingrained in the human species from all of our past behaviors. I mean all of our human reward systems of accomplishing things and feeling good about accomplishing things and building up self confidence. And that's real, you know, so the, the pull yourself by your bootstraps in a lot of ways. That's good advice. Yeah. Unfortunately it gets conglomerated and attached to this hatred towards homosexuals. It's weird, you know, fucking pro war stance,

Speaker 3:          01:54:47       strong religion, religious kind of a context and flavor to things as well, which kind of has a, you talk about things happening when you're a kid. I've always felt that, you know, that's one of the things that, that really influences your thinking and the way that you have an outlook on the world. It's, and it's, I think that's a part of what religion does is they want to get your young and they want to get you indoctrinated and they want to sort of have a, a good soldier for the, for the balance going forward kind of a thing. Um, and that, that was, I never grew up that way. I don't know about you, but like I, we're, we're not a very religious household, but I've certainly come across a lot of religion and some of whom are like totally awesome and really nice and really, you know, I, I, my, my wife actually came up really baptist and there was some point like around when she was 18 or 19, it's just like, I can't do this anymore.

Speaker 3:          01:55:35       I'm tired of feeling bad about myself for Xyz. Um, you know, and so she sort of left the fold, but she said that was one of the most difficult thing she ever did, peeling away from really all of her friends, all of, all of that, you know, because of the entire, it was a nice little safe bubble that she was in. And, and she, she still likes a lot of those people to this day. Um, but overall it was something she felt she had to do in order to sort of grow, I guess, or, or, or make some sort of separation from that time in her life.

Speaker 6:          01:56:05       Well, there's a disconnect if you, if you subscribe to religion and all of its principles by the book you, this is just a massive disconnect you have to have with just reality itself. You're believing in Adam and eve and resurrections and miracles and no evidence whatsoever to support any of these things that are completely contrary to anything that you've ever experienced. And then all the evidence that you see of Science, oh earth, there's only 6,000 years old according to this book. Oh, okay. Did they just find some hundred million year old shit lies propaganda by the liberal media? They were planted down there by the, you know, by Barack? Yeah. Well you know the homosexuals. Yeah,

Speaker 3:          01:56:48       there's all have, you know, and they went down and they buried those bones and they sort of acid dated them somehow so that they seem older than they are.

Speaker 6:          01:56:54       We know carbon dating. It's not an exact sign. No. Fracking is a myth, you know? Meanwhile though, they'll talk bad about homosexuals while they're eating a shrimp cocktail and you're like, Yo, dude, you got to read the whole book because there's more shit about not eating shellfish. Then there is about being gay. You know, you're not supposed to eat shrimp and not supposed to eat pigs. Like there's a lot of shit that you're doing wrong and that's supposed to work on Saturday. That's right. Yeah. You're not supposed to have religious tattoos. You fuck head like that. So fuck yeah. You're not supposed to tattoo your body. That's in the Bible. People have religious tattoos. It's like, talk about not reading the whole book.

Speaker 3:          01:57:32       Yeah. Oh, exactly. I think, and you just pick and choose. Sure. One of the funniest things is, you know, really hardcore, uh, Christians will, will make fun of Scientology, which, fair enough? Go ahead. I'm perfectly fine if you want to make fun of Scientology, but, but to obligate their own kind of weird stories than that. Their book presents as well. It's like, yeah, it's, there's a certain you are you not spotting the irony here that there's a certain similarity between their weird Phaeton run sort of stories and your weird, you know, died and reborn after three days. Kind of an all of the sort of, you know, stories that, that we will sort of beggar reality as well.

Speaker 6:          01:58:10       Well I think compartmentalize thinking is very dangerous and I think once you just sort of make your mind up that your way is the only way you stop being objective and you cease all introspective thought. You get sort of locked into this mindset and you put these blinders on, they don't allow you see you, you, you just see yourself as how ridiculous you are. And that's how people get caught doing dumb shit. Like Ted Haggardy, the guy who was, oh God damn running this giant religious church, huge stadium filled with people. That's right. Meanwhile Smoking Crystal Meth,

Speaker 5:          01:58:43       Bang and gay prostitutes. And there's this recent guy who was anti gay marriage proponent who turns out he had run a, a a female drag strip show homeboy's named Jamie. This guy, it just came out the other day, was in North Carolina, um, politician and he was a fucking, he's a drag queen and he hates guessing. You see that there was that other one recently where that KKK guy shot and then they find out he'd had sex with a male prostitute, black male prostitute dressed as a woman. Or it doesn't take long before you've somehow dig into these guys' history and you're like, I, it's not even surprising anymore really. It's like I knew that little skeleton was in your cousin Craig. See that's the liberal media. Just this man is in jail, talk for himself. So the man's in jail and they sell that information. Just now have the information that he has sex with a gay male prostitute.

Speaker 5:          01:59:39       How about where, where were you a year ago? Do you know how easy it is to doctor macro fish so that they could go back and look through it and it would be, they're pretty easy. Pretty so, so they're watching what you're doing right now. Here's homeboy. That's what he used to look like. Oh really? His name's Steve Wilde. Just just, just a rough number of Cox in his mouth. How many sets do you say that a thousand lifetime? I would say that probably is a look at them. That's what face you just want to fuck big fat. Chubby cheeks probably knows how to take a tick like a champ, especially when he's got the earrings on. Those are just handles big grips, big grippy earrings. Look at them. Silly Bitch Domini in the, by the way, is nothing wrong with dressing like a woman. Nothing wrong with stuck in a thousand cars.

Speaker 5:          02:00:23       You're sort of, when you're, when you espouse a certain viewpoint that's totally against all of that, you know, and it's really mean spirited and hateful towards that kind of a thing that really gets on your nerves. Yeah. It's ridiculous. Yeah, but people love to do that. They love to point the finger. It's like no one loves to criticize women for being promiscuous more than sluts, sluts, love to shit on other slots. Is that so? Oh good, good Mowgli. Nick Carter, Aka Craig. They do, man. It's like a big thing with girls there. The girls who are promiscuous love to shit on other girls who are promiscuous. They, oh is that fucking bitch? She's a whore. She's a fucking everybody. Meanwhile you're fucking everybody you know and men do the same thing. Guys who sleep around are constantly shitting on guys who slipped her sleep or had too much worse. It's a common thing. It's like people try to throw people off the case like, oh it's like, yeah, exactly. It's like that self hatred thing almost sometimes that that sorta like, yeah, there's definitely a lot of that. You know used to see that about a guys who used to steal jokes with sometimes like accuse other people stealing their Joe throw him off the case and other comedians would be like, is this motherfucking serious? Like everybody knows you steal, you do on

Speaker 3:          02:01:40       stage. And mitzia would constantly accuse people of stealing as material because he was the biggest and everybody would be like, what the F is going on here? But when you think about like the most obvious defense, that's the one. If I'm getting accused of something, I'll just, I'll just accuse other people of the same thing that I'm running up into. I was wondering that too, like for you, you know I talked about earlier about like when I rate read Stephen King the second time as an adult, as a writer myself and trying to break it apart. Do you, do you do that with other comedians? Do you like we'll listen to them the first time and just like fuck that. So good. And then the second time you sort of try and look at their, just see what they're doing. Not to, not to copy it or steal anything, but just see how, how are, how are they forensically almost putting together these jokes and how were they

Speaker 6:          02:02:21       sort of, what I really do is I like to go back and listen to really old stuff to try to understand the time period. Cause I think that a lot of comedy is a weird thing. Like a lot of old movies, they, they still hold up today. Like if you go back and watch the hustler with Jack, such a good movie. Yeah, yeah. Great movie. Yeah. Paul knew holds up completely today. It's still a great movie. But any comedy from 1962 very tough to listen.

Speaker 3:          02:02:49       Yeah, it's changed. It's comedy changes so fast. I think like some like horror or or something like the hustler, like the thing is as good now, you know, the Kirk Russell one as as it was when it was made, but comedy, there's a certain shelf life, it evolves a lot faster I think. And something that was really edgy at one point becomes stale dated. I think.

Speaker 6:          02:03:10       Yeah, that's, that's sort of my feeling about guys like Lenny Bruce, who in my opinion is probably the most important comedian ever. And he was the guy who got arrested the most and he was the guy who pushed the boundaries of understanding language and content and what's the intent of what you're trying to say and what do you, what, what are we doing when we're suppressing this intent? And he was a brilliant, brilliant guy who went, ultimately went mad. I never followed him towards the end of it. Oh yeah. He died of a heroin overdose. He, uh, he went mad and he would go on stage and just read transcripts of his legal proceedings. I mean, it was, it was really, really boring stuff. Kauffman NASC kind of, no, no, no, no. Because Kauffman was doing it ironically, like he would stand on stage and play mighty mouse theme song, go here, I come to save the day and he would just freak people out because they expected him to do common and it would just do weird shit.

Speaker 6:          02:04:04       Yeah. But Lenny was going nuts and towards the end of his life, um, he would go on stage and read directly out of the transcripts and try to explain why the judge was wrong. But there was no humor really. Just more like it was going crazy. Yeah. And he was doing heroin all the time. It means there's a lot going on. Yeah. Yeah. But I will listen to his comedy and try to put myself into this sort of almost innocent mindset of the people that were listed are living in the 1960s listening to this kind of comedy. Trying to wrap my head around what kind of an impact this guy would, would have

Speaker 1:          02:04:37       had, but I don't necessarily try to deconstruct their comedy. Comedy is different in a lot of ways than fiction. And I think in fiction when you're reading a great novel, like you're reading Moby Dick or something like that, it still holds true holds the test of time. Yeah. When you, you, you read that, you can kind of get a feeling for the way the narrative is driven and the way the, the use of words shapes the environment that you're imagining. And comedy is very different in that. It's just, um, I guess I, I certainly did when I was first starting out, but I, but I don't really do that anymore. If I watch comedy now, I watch it just to enjoy it. Yeah. Try to watch it as a fan.

Speaker 4:          02:05:22       Yeah. Yeah. And I do, I mean, I do the same thing with, with reading, uh, and there's some stuff that you realize, this is awesome. This is outside of what I do, I could possibly do anyways. I imagine that you listened to some comedians and it's the same. It's like what they're doing is, it's fabulous, but it's so far field from the star. It allows you to actually just to enjoy it totally as a fan because there's no worry about, wow, this is going to influence me. Uh, in some way that that would be problematical. Sure. Cause it's just so different. But who's an example like that for you as a writer is just so, so different? Yeah. Um, well like, yeah, like, like Margaret Atwood, for example, the Canadian writer, she did like the Handmaid's tale was made into a movie. I don't remember that you vomit or something. If someone knows to run with me, sorry. Go ahead and want to do a week in prison or read the Handmaid's tale of the Margaret Atwood book. No, you read one a week for the rest of your life. Like I'll do my week. I'd lie rather take the prison term. I'll tell you my presence, but you don't understand it's going to enrich you and grow you as a person. Oh, okay. Yeah. I've come on, not the kind of person I want to grow to be, you know? Right.

Speaker 1:          02:06:34       Take a fucking a pineapple tree and you grow it in the same

Speaker 4:          02:06:37       where you grow grapes. Right? It's not the same environment. You fuck it. I don't know if that's a good analogy. I, you know, I worry about that too. Cause I'm, I am a little bit of a chameleon. So if I start reading too many, say like newer books, suddenly that becomes, or Westerns, you know, I think I wanted, my next book wants to be sort of like a, like a horror western sort of a thing. So first of all, you, I need to read a lot of those things just to situate myself, I think in that time. And you sort of get the feel for it, but you do worry that you're going to be like, you know, you want it, don't want to be derivative. I guess that's the thing. Right? And, and that and that, you know, because in, in, in comedy it's joke stealing, but it's all plagiarism. It's the same thing. And there's, there's, there's some writers who probably get too close to their source material and then they find out later that like, this is so close that it's almost copying what this, this other person is who I really admire. I see why I did it, but fuck, I'm not own self here. I'm more

Speaker 3:          02:07:36       like just this person.

Speaker 6:          02:07:37       Yeah. That's very common in comedy in the beginning.

Speaker 3:          02:07:40       Yeah. Where you're looking for your voice, right. Your style. Like eventually I feel it's like a thumbprint and initially your thumb print is, it's, there's nothing on it, but slowly the world's start developing and you get something that's distinctively your own when it comes with time,

Speaker 6:          02:07:52       don't really know what you're doing yet. And you want to be like this guy that you admire. So you start doing colony that's similar to this guy. For me on the beginning it was Richard. Jenny course. Yeah. In the mask. I remember him in the one, one of his one movie wants to stand up was so much better than his movie stuff, but I remember, uh, like being a big admirer of his and then onstage like hearing myself going, Oh my God, I'm like, I'm ripping off his clothes. There's so many guys who they start out like, I mean, this is like, I was essentially an open miker I was like a year into my comedy career or somewhere around there. And uh, I realized it, but I see it all the time. There's a lot of, like, there's a lot of David tell clones out there and there was a few dean cook clones for a while and there's probably some Louis CK clay now. Yeah, yeah. Let me, is this just a thing where someone admires his style of comedy and they start to imitate? I've, I've seen my own act onstage as in someone else's mouth. It's got to feel weird, weird, parsing it out. You're sort of like, that is, yeah.

Speaker 3:          02:08:54       And it's not, it's not necessarily the actual, uh, joke that they've taken, but they've taken more your, you know what I mean? You're starting at the essence of the way that you present it,

Speaker 6:          02:09:03       what way you deliver things. Also like your subject matter, they'll just twist around your subject matter. And so it's not like your material they're taking, but God damn, it's close. It's just like you, he can see the road that got them there. That's only a couple of blocks away from the source. Yeah. And you can't, you can't really claim originality cause the, the real problem with originality is there's no such thing because everybody, yeah. And that's, you know, publishers want that. They're like, what? What is, it's like everything's been done already. I hate unique viewpoints. They can be unique but ultimately original boy, the whole language is an original. What if you're going to write about murder, monsters, air, water, the elements. I mean, all those things have been covered and done. We all understand that any description that you have of any of these various aspects is going to resonate with people because they directly have either literary experience in it, some film experience, and then have an actual real life experience. Yeah. So there is no real truly original thought anymore. Oh,

Speaker 3:          02:10:10       but I found, I don't know about you with, uh, with comedy or with some of the other things you've done, but one of the biggest leaps I made is recognizing that my own life is, um, has value. You know what I mean? There are interesting moments in my life, interesting scenes, things that I've experienced and you bring them in, in the service of a character. It's, you know, it's, it's transported and you're telling it through, through a character's eyes. And I've always felt like there, you don't have to make anything up,

Speaker 4:          02:10:34       right. You're just going back and remembering as deeply as possible. And those things are original. Even if it's within a story that it's, it's self might've been told a thousand times. The one thing that you can go back and you can stake a claim on. It's like this comes from some element of my own life. And I know it has to be original. Not mean even that's not original because other human beings have experienced it. And that's your hope is that you're actually going to be able to reach into their chest and really sort of have some sort of reckoning between you. So I'm sorta like synchronicity that you meet, maybe. Hopefully, you know, do I think the word isn't original? The real, the real word is derivative. And the real problem that people have is when they're intentionally derivative and that what that does is it stifles creativity.

Speaker 4:          02:11:18       Yeah. Because someone like say, say if someone, I don't want to give away the story, the of your book, the troop. But if someone read your book and decided, you know what, I'm going to make my own story about this exact scenario. And then they kept going back to your book and they started adding elements to it with different dialogue, but the same elements and you know, and here's the fucking guy was, I mean that's, that's gross. And it upsets us when we find out that your originality, we will, we can see you have to be or perceived to be originality is really just you comping and twisting around the original work of someone else. It's very upsetting. Yeah. Oh yeah. Yeah. And you feel like that's again, why would you get into it in the first place? You know, I, but I know in publishing, say when the Da Vinci Code came out, you know, publishers were like, we need the next Davinci code.

Speaker 4:          02:12:11       And there would be, there were a lot of uh, sort of knock knockoffs of it with the same kind of ideas and, and, but they were actually, you know, the writers whether they wanted to write them or not. Sometimes money, you know, how has an influence there, you know, if someone's going to offer you a nice amount of money to, to write what you know is sort of a, a bit of a knock off, um, you know, uh, people, people may be enticed into sort of doing that. You know, whether that's why they got into writing in the first place. You have to assume not, you know. Um, but uh, uh, yeah, I found like there's this, there's some element of that and there's, there's some element of, um, you know, our original publishers sort of don't want originality sometimes. Sometimes they're like, this is a known commodity.

Speaker 4:          02:12:54       This is working really well. We would like you to do stuff like, like this, you know? And sometimes they're even scared of original. I was like, Lenny Bruce, I people who, who are that original, they, it's not an easy road to hoe. Whereas if you do sort of do maybe a rip off of a Dane Cook Act, I think you might get initially get a better pop than you would if you're really charting sorta really original territory ends. It depends on how well you're doing it for an idiot and you're ripping off someone like, yeah, you might get a little reaction. This is a few of those guys out there right now, but I think that what we appreciate in someone is we appreciate artistic expression, meaning

Speaker 6:          02:13:32       that we're all influenced by music and movies and literature and things that we've experienced in life. There's influences that are just undeniable, but what is your intent when you sit down to create something, is your intent to express yourself in you in your own unique language, your own unique experiences in your own creativity? Or are you just copying shit? Yeah, when you're just copying shit that makes us angry. Yeah, of course. There's like a certain amount of like hate that Nickelback gets yes. That I'm not sure why they get that hate, but I think that some of it has to do with the fact that it seems like they concocted it. Like they went and put together these songs based on some algorithm. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know if it's fair. I don't get it. I don't know why the hate exist, but boy, if you want to fucking make an audience laugh, just talk about how Shitty Nickelback is and people go, yeah, they do suck. But there's certain bands that probably suck equally or worse that take, get a free pass or suck in a total. Yeah,

Speaker 3:          02:14:35       different way. I think what bothers me, Mumford and sons, I said it. Yeah. Even, I mean, I hate to throw these guys under the bus, but arcade fire a little bit. Oh you don't know how they're Canadian Canadian band and it's like there, you know it's like if you're being like super original, that's almost in a way as a fake originality, you know what I mean? Like I've, I've noticed that as well is like you're not really as original as you think you are, but you've convinced other people that you're really original and that's like a double delusion. Whereas Nickelback is what they are.

Speaker 6:          02:15:07       Well it's when someone's affected what I get about Mumford and sons, I like, I like a lot of their songs. I think some of their songs are very good, especially the early songs. But now I feel like they're in this groove of doing that certain kind of music and so they dress a certain kind of way and I'm like, you're wearing a costume. You might as well be dressed up as a fucking clown. Okay. Cause you're dressed up like a guy. You look like a pioneer or something. You're out there with a mason jar in your hand. You're playing a fucking homemade fiddle for what are you doing dude? Yeah, no, in the middle of the field. Yeah. What's up wheat field and the fucking piano? What's going on here? You're, you're, you're, you're, this is an affectations and you wonder if they started

Speaker 3:          02:15:44       that way or if they got engineered like someone, some, some producer came and said, listen, we need more wheat fields. We unique. I look at all these guys in jars saying what the fuck is going on now? Whether they started that way or whether that's what's up with those boots. Hoedown boots going on. You

Speaker 6:          02:15:58       are you working in the field and then you took some time off to sing or you a multimillionaire rock star cause I get confused. What's your fucking, you're goofy beard. Fucking stop. Dot. What's up with the fake trees behind you too? That's even more offensive. We're down home. We're country. It's not a fucking hotel lobby and Beverly Hills doing a photo shoot with makeup on. Fuck yourself. Well, I think that, you know, you become a, you also become a prisoner to your success if you get a amount of success doing a certain thing. Like I was talking about this yesterday, but I, I had a friend who was a fat guy who was the agent told him don't lose weight. You lose weight, you're losing roles. Yeah. Like he's like you're losing parts if you, if you, if you lose weight and like he is just, he was trapped in this thing that he had created this overweight

Speaker 3:          02:16:47       boring character. Exactly. Well the, and that does seem to be like, I'm sure you've talked about it before, but like it's not as funny. Like Joe Piscopo even getting ripped, you know what I mean? You managed to do it, but Joe Piscopo couldn't go from the sort of weedy guy to like the big bulky guy of like dead heat and maintain being as funny as as he was. And the same thing with fat. If you lose the weight, suddenly people are just like, oh, you're not as funny. And why is that? I'm not really sure. But there's the physical comedy of just being a big guy.

Speaker 6:          02:17:16       Yeah. I Dunno what happened with Joe Piscopo, but I've heard the comparisons of you. Oh really? Anna, you don't welcome it. I imagine I don't give a fuck. It doesn't bother. I did. Maybe that's why it didn't work because I didn't give a fuck if I get it.

Speaker 3:          02:17:28       Plus you came on the scene, you were already big. Yeah. You never understood is in some other body position. You know, you're always a big guy. Back News

Speaker 6:          02:17:37       radio when I first saw you, so it wasn't as big. I didn't really lift this, which words back then? I was just kickboxing, but I had been a black belt in martial arts since I was 17 so I had come from this physical background from the beginning where I, I kinda was really, I'm self conscious about it. When I first used to do comedy, it would like kind of hide my body a little. Oh really? Yeah. We're like really bulky clothes to sort of hide the my shape because I felt like people wouldn't understand that. I had seen guys on stage who were muscular too and it'd be like well that's really abstract going over is not smart to like come up and like sort of a ripped up or whatever. Really Sean. Yeah they don't want, people don't want to see that they would do, they'd rather see you out of shape.

Speaker 6:          02:18:16       That's kind of funny to have gone go stage with a big beer gut slapping your gut while you're telling your punch line. It's kind of funny but it doesn't mean that you can't be funny and be fit. It's like we have these ideas that we know what's funny and what's not. But you don't know until you see it. And that's one of the reasons why someone can't really teach you how to be funny cause you could never teach Mitch Hedberg like you never have a class in how to be Mitch Hedberg. No, cause it doesn't fit any rules. No. He's his own entity entirely. Yeah. So you can't fit Joey Diaz. There's gear, there's guys, you just, you can't fit them into a mold. It doesn't. And then you realized somewhere along the line, if it's funny to you, it's about trying to figure out a way to get inside people's heads and get them to relate.

Speaker 6:          02:19:01       They can relate. Yeah, but it has to be funny. Do you, and what's a lot of bad comedy is it's not even funny to them. They're just you. There's, there's a certain stage of comedy. There's two stages in the beginning. The one stage number one is you just do anything that works. You just, they're like, there's like hammers and saws and you just using tools, which joke, it's like a tool. Once you get a certain amount of proficiency and confidence and certain amount of stage time, then you start doing things that you think are funny and then that's the shift, the shift. It goes from doing things that you think will work. And then I started and you look around and they laugh and you're like, oh, thank God. And then two, you get a guy who goes on stage with like a half a grand.

Speaker 6:          02:19:45       He's like, why is this going on? Because I see that. I'm like, Whoa, fuck. Are you talking and the audience starts laughing. Yes. Because they relate to the way this guy's thinking is, he actually does see humor in what he's saying. It's an honest vision of humor. Yeah. And those two stages are very distinct and there's a huge difference. And that's the thing about joke thieves and people who are derivative is they never get out of that first stage, even though as positive as they can get. That's why the, there's a lot of guys who started out stealing jokes and then they stopped. I could name names, I will not. But they stopped stealing and they started writing original material and their original material is dog shit. And the reason why is they never really learned how to do comedy. They never really understand the language of comedy because a big part of comedy has to deal with honesty, both honesty with the environment that you live in, an honesty with yourself and how you interface with all the people around you. And if you're pretending you this comedic genius, I'm really just a plagiarist. You're fucking, you're dealing with a lot of demons. You're dealing with a lot of walls you've built up in your psyche and those walls just trip you up when you try to write original stuff. I would imagine that's the same way with literature

Speaker 3:          02:20:51       very much, very much. And I think that second stage, uh, is, is right. The first stage is your sort of, uh, you're, you're almost emulating the people that you love, you know, and the second stage is you want to do something on your own. And that second stage I think with you is dealing with the idea that you're confident enough that this joke means a lot to me. Whether it's going to go over, I can actually deal with that. Whereas in the first stage you couldn't possibly deal with the reaction that didn't feed some sort of sense of accomplishment or get them to laugh or that I think sometimes with, with comedians that I've watched, obviously I don't, I rarely, rarely watched them through the early stages of their career, but they're there, the comfortability there, and it's the same with writers. They're like, if I fail, that's fine. I wanted to fail doing something really interesting, really original to me. And that really is an expression of what the hell I got into this in the first place for

Speaker 6:          02:21:39       a good example of that is a hunter Thompson in the early days used to take f f Scott Fitzgerald and just retyping Oh yeah, he would, he would retire the great Gatsby over and over and over again. And the idea was that I think he did it with Hemingway's well. Okay. And the idea was that he was learning the rhythm of great writing and that there was in, in writing down the great writing of other people, you sort of develop a sense of the rhythm. Yeah, I could see that. And in a way, that's how I got into comedy because I would like see like an HBO special. And then I would tell my friends, Holy Shit, did you see Sam Kinison last night? He had this joke. And then I would tell them the joke and they would laugh at me telling them the joke and I would sort of realize through rhythm of doing Sam's material, you know, in his voice, you know, and I was married for two fucking years. Oh Wow. How about like club bed and your friends are laughing and you kind of get the rhythm of this, this thing which is very similar to what

Speaker 3:          02:22:41       what learner did. Yeah, absolutely.

Speaker 6:          02:22:43       Did you ever do that? Did you ever try to like picture yourself writing a great piece that someone else had written and just like go over it?

Speaker 3:          02:22:51       I did a lot of, um, not quite like that, but similarly like you'd, you'd read a, there are some writers probably the same as some comedians who style seems so easy to imitate. It was an example. Well Ray Carver, the short story writer, the American short story writer would be an example of a style that you look at and you're like, I could do this, but you can't. Once you, once you really set your mind to like, I'll try and write a carver type story. That's what makes the genius there I think is that it seems easy. It seems that something you can do, but, but the genius is not only in the genius of him but in the genius of his deceptively simple style. So I tried to write say a carver story and it was a total nightmare and a failure. Um, you know, we have things in the writing recom trunk stories, basically stories that you write, you throw him in a trunk, you're never going to see him again.

Speaker 3:          02:23:37       And my trunk is full of stories like that. And I imagine your, your trunk similarly, it's full of stuff. And these are all things that like you need to go through. I mean, I, I, I probably was rejected 200 times at magazines before I finally placed a story. Like I could literally have filled a shopping bag or a pillowcase with rejection slips. When you have an idea for a story, how many of those ideas actually wound up being wind up being stories that you will turn into a book or a short story? Well, it's a, it's a pretty small percentage. Uh, in terms of the ones that you know, I always think of, it's like a, you know, the way a pearl gets created, you've got like an oyster and us, a little bit of sand gets in it and then if enough like Nacro whatever goes around it, then I'm like, okay, that's enough.

Speaker 3:          02:24:19       It feels like the characters are strong enough. I've got an idea of the plot and where I want to send these characters. Then you sort of harvest that pearl and it becomes a short story, becomes a novel, but there's several that just are imperfect. You can tell just in their conception they're imperfect. I don't have it. You know, it's different, right? I see. I would write a store, I'd send it out. If it's not working, you don't really know until you get enough rejections that it's clearly, okay, that's this fucking thing ain't working. Do you guys get up on stage? That's the different, or like have you ever, how many times do you tell a joke that you really feel strong about or work on a piece of material before you have to say this, this isn't meeting my expectation of what I thought or do you just keep telling it anyway and just say fuck it. This is

Speaker 6:          02:24:58       the depends. Depends on how much I really enjoy it. There's certain ones just fucking never work and I do. I'm just for, there's certain ones that are right and I go, I know this has got something but I can't figure out what it is. And then there's certain, there's certain bits that as I write them, they come out and fully finished form. Yeah. Oh that's brilliant. One that happened. I got one of my favorite bits and I'm doing right now that is in the moment. I wrote it on a plane and I wrote it. It's like a 10 minute piece and I wrote it in its full form on a plane and I did it on stage that Monday and it just destroyed. It was, it was like, it was done. Like from the minute it came out, it came out in June and it was, it resonated with me and I was so angry when I wrote it and it was so, it was the, it was a about a certain particular group of people that are so incredibly hypocritical and ridiculous that it was due and I'd caught someone lying about something and it was in this group of people and I was like, I have had enough of this and I just went on and married came out like as a chunk it was done.

Speaker 6:          02:26:01       Then there's other bits, like I know there's something there, but I don't know what it is. Yeah. And sometimes they, those bits will last for years and I'll throw them in like every third or fourth set. When I'm killing in the middle, I'll throw it in there and that'll just, the audience be like, what the fuck is that? I'm like, all right, you got it.

Speaker 3:          02:26:16       It's got to die. Yeah. Sometimes it's like you feel the energy of the room and maybe I can slip this in. And it's, I mean with me too, I think it's a matter of, I've had some stories that constantly got rejected and then you, you, I think you get a bit of a name for yourself and then those will find acceptance because they're like, okay, well he's done this and this and this. But then, but I find to me like speed is something like I wrote the true probably in about six weeks, which is the fastest I've ever written anything. But it was fun. You know, I'd come out of wherever the room where I write in my wife would be like, you look energized. You don't look like all the dragon haggard like you do when you stumble out after working on your other books.

Speaker 3:          02:26:51       Like a vampire has been stuck in your blood out for eight hours. Um, and I'm like, that's sort of what has told me that I hope I am able to write a lot more books in the horror genre because I just enjoy the writing of it. It's more fun to me. It's more, it comes like that. And I mean, the reason I think that came to you so fast, first of all, because you're passionate about it, but second of all, because you've been working at it a long time and when those things come, you know how to deal with them. And I think now I know better. Okay, if the idea comes to me and it's, I'm, I'm ready to make, make hay with it.

Speaker 6:          02:27:19       Well I think you should really read a lot more harm man. But just because of what you said and because of the book being really fun. I love that as that genre. And I love when a book like that comes out. And so you saying that like this is something that like thrilled you and energize you as your rent. I really hope you keep doing that, man.

Speaker 3:          02:27:38       Not, yeah, no, I appreciate it. Thank you. And I'm, we're, we're sort of in between contracts right now. So I don't know. I might be, you know, selling oranges on the side of the freeway for all that. I know. When, when, when I next w when I next see you, I see you come to Massey Hall right? I will, I'll have to come out. I saw you were at Massey Hall once in Toronto in a couple of times and the Sony Centre reisling go and check that out. But anyways, we're, we're sort of in that weird space where I don't really know what's going to happen. Exactly. So, so hopefully I'll have good news. Listen man, you could self publish. This is a new era. It's true. Yeah. There is a lot more of that going on. Some huge successful people doing it that way.

Speaker 6:          02:28:14       Unbelievable success. People have had unknown's that have put out something and just through word of mouth through Amazon and what have you and your books.

Speaker 3:          02:28:22       It's incredible, isn't it? Gaps in publishers who, who you wonder, like I read this book wool by a writer called Hugh Howey and it's Sorta Saifai really, really damn good. And your end, you know, you find out his history as he's been rejected by x number of publishers and you're like, how did that happen? You know what I mean? But it does. It does happen. And it's great that there's that opportunity now that like, okay, well listen that, that's fine. I get it. You guys have whatever agenda that you're pursuing. This is what I want to write and I have a way to get it out to my, my hopefully readership and build it that way. Now is this, is this book the truth? Is it out now? Uh, yeah. Yeah. When did you come out? You got an arc of it? Yeah. It came out a couple months ago.

Speaker 3:          02:29:03       Yeah, there it is. There's a new cover too. They just, they totally changed the cover while they changed the Koa. Darker. It's just something that they do in publishing from time to time. I'm not sure why either. But yeah, they made a big, a big change of it. So now it's just an isolated guy on a hilltop or something. Well, I got the best one I liked. I liked that one too with the, that's the, uh, the UK cover. It looks that way. Yeah. With the, the, the birds and the lightening flashes. I like it. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          02:29:32       I like the American cover, but yeah, it's totally, totally different for sure. Have you started writing a new one? Yeah, the followup is we did do that one for sure. It's called the deep, so it takes, I love undersea stuff and like I love like the ocean so it takes place at the bottom of the Mariana. You know when a James Cameron went down in that so eight miles below the surface. Crazy fuck he is. I know he's a nut. He's out of his mind. He is out of his mind a millions of dollars to the bottom of the ocean fucking boat. Yeah. And just, you know, picks up what, there's nothing down there either. The first God ever do that too. He is. He is. And I don't know if you, I don't know about you. Like claustrophobia is one thing that I'm not good but in tight spaces and if you saw what he went down in, it was basically like he had, you know, metal down this side of this side.

Speaker 3:          02:30:17       He basically went down in a coffin. Yeah. I don't have a problem with tight spaces. I do have a problem with tight spaces at the bottom of the notion though, how many miles deepest? Well challenger deep is, is below the Marianas trench. So that's eight miles. And the pressure is something like seven jumbo jets per like pressing down on your per square foot. So yeah, it's, I feel like that. See, I don't know about you. What are you scared of? That's interesting. Are you yeah, like animals, animals I find with a kid now I'm afraid of shit happened into my, my soul for something. That's thing, but it's the Marriott, look at this image of that Jamie just pulled there it is. She's, so there's Mount Everest. That's the height of Mount Everest compared to the deep, the deepness of challenging. So yeah, that's insane. It is. Miles miles down. That's the deepest part of the ocean that we're aware of. Is that what it is that we're aware of? There might be a spot somewhere that they haven't other could very well be. Yeah, exactly. But um, that's the deepest known depth. Damn deep.

Speaker 4:          02:31:20       Yeah. That is so ridiculous. But I figured, okay, well I don't like tight spaces. I don't like that pressure. I don't like the dark like down there darknesses I mean I don't think it's like the darkness between the stars. It's that dark. It's probably a darkness that I don't know if I've ever grappled with. So yeah, for a horror book it sort of has a lot of potential of things that scare the shit out of me. And that's sort of where I got to start with. Is it like a monster book? No, no, no. It's a ghost. So they're billing it as sort of like the abyss meets the shining. So there is kind of that that you know, the, the shining being like, oh, it's almost like a haunted, they've set up a research station down there and it's another crew going down to figure out what the hell happened to the crew beforehand. I could have read it. Yeah. Yeah. So, so I'm done. It's all done. It's all done. Yes. I will make sure you get a priority. Uh, when the art comes out I'll, I'll get one shipped. When do you think it will be done? Well, I don't know. I feel like they probably are going to do a few. If soon they're there, they're put there. It's every, it's the year after. So basically it's January of next year, but you'll, the arcs will be out,

Speaker 6:          02:32:27       you know. But do they, when you do something like that, like do you bring it to the publisher and the publisher gives notes?

Speaker 4:          02:32:33       Yes. Yeah. Um, basically you, I got a two book contract, so I had already written the troop, gave it to my agent. My agent sent it into the publisher. They accepted, they say, well, we want another book too. What's your idea? I said, and on something, something to do with down in the ocean. They said, good. Sold. So you write that one and then you just send it to your editor and he, in this case, yeah, it gave me all sorts of notes and uh, you know, you work on that and you go back and forth and then eventually at some point we say, we're fucking sick of this. Are we done? Yes, we're done. So That's interesting.

Speaker 6:          02:33:00       No, who's qualified to give you notes like that? Like, how do, how do you distinguish whether or not someone's qualified to give you notes? And do you often disagree with their notes?

Speaker 4:          02:33:10       Yes. Cause you wouldn't, I guess you wouldn't have that really. I mean, you might have trusted people that you would deal with and say, well what do you think of this bit? You know, so don't even do that. No, no, no. The audience does it. Ah, that's right. They're, that they're the most serious arbiter of things. Yeah. They're the grand judge. Do Myself.

Speaker 6:          02:33:27       Beautiful thing about materials that you get to listen to it on my iPhone or my, um, my note, my galaxy note three has, I've had have it for like maybe four or five months and it might have hundred and 50 sets on it. Oh Wow. Yeah. And I can listen to all those sets

Speaker 4:          02:33:47       and then started the audience reaction and gauge how it's working. So that's, yeah, that's a similar idea to it. To an editor, I mean, an editor relationship with the writers. Pretty, uh, pretty important obviously. Because the one thing is you can't go snatch your book off the shelves once it's there. It's there. You gotta live with how it is. So you got to work as hard as you can in this stage to make it as, I mean, it's never going to be perfect. There's going to be things about it that you'll look at five years later and just go, wow, why did I do that? But each book, I think each book probably just like each, maybe one of your comedy cds is an expression of that time in your life too. And you got to let

Speaker 3:          02:34:18       it be that. Well there is that. Right?

Speaker 6:          02:34:20       You know, out of the hundred and 50 sets, maybe a hundred of them are from like a year ago that I've got stored. Like I take the MP three and I saved them and then maybe 50 of them or so, or over the last four or five months. Okay. And then what I'll do is never listened to the old ones, but always think that I'm going to

Speaker 3:          02:34:39       pack rat. I go, hold on to them.

Speaker 6:          02:34:42       But the most recent ones are the really important ones, like a on this phone. This is a new phone. It only has Santa Barbara only as Friday night show in Santa Barbara. That's it. But eventually, you know over the course of a few months, it'll have a like a Wednesday night, I'm at the Ice House, I'll have that set on it. I'll listen to that Thursday and I'll break out the notebook and I'll listen to it, the headphones on, and then my next set I'll add the notes and then I'll try to figure out what I did differently then it'll grow. But the beautiful thing about comedy is it has built in editors.

Speaker 3:          02:35:15       Yeah. Audience and also you can, you can, there's no sense of it being on a shelf. You, it evolves as you, as you, you know, you work the act over and you work the act over in it and it sort of becomes, and we do that as much as we can. You know, that book probably went through seven or eight edits, but at at some point you got to just say, well that's it. We're on a schedule. You can over edit it too. You can sort of rip sort of the rawness and I'm sure you can probably do that in a comedy act as well. You can rip some of the stuff that is really most important. And most the Ron, if you take the rawness out of the rough edges and you make it sort of smooth it over and you listen to too many editors, then you can't please everybody. I think that's another thing too. I've recognized it

Speaker 6:          02:35:52       self. Like you lose your vision of what, what is good and what's bad. Because I know as a comic you certainly can, you Lou, you listen to a joke so many times you just like it gets means like it's just a bunch of gobbly gook to you.

Speaker 3:          02:36:04       Totally. Yeah, totally. And that's, I guess that's a danger that we both faced in our separate, you know, but very close, closely related kinds of careers. Um, so it's about listening to the right and ultimately it's like listening cause especially with horror, you have someone, you know, I've had plenty of emails and I'm, no, you have to like what, what kind of a person are you? Kind of an awful creature. What sort of primordial swamp pit did you crawl out of to, you know, uh, become who you are. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, absolutely. I, you know, I'm not near that. I mean, I'm not nearly in the public eye, say as you are. I wouldn't have to face that level of scrutiny, but certainly in my small way, yeah, of course I can make a tweet, just a joke. Oh, and people will be bombarding you. Oh, I'm sure. Yeah. Long searching and trying to find psychological cracks in your armor. I wrote something, I thought it was funny. Go Fuck Yourself. Think about it for more than like, you know what I mean? But at the same point also, you don't recant and be like, oh, well Geez, I better change things because I wrote, wrote,

Speaker 6:          02:37:04       um, just, I, I watched this woman, she was on a date and she was talking about how much she hates children. And I wrote on Twitter that I view women who don't like kids the same

Speaker 5:          02:37:16       way I would viewed dogs. I like to eat their own shit and uh, obviously got a reaction, which leaves a lot of room for interpretation. But this kind of wrote a whole blog about all that. I only view women as, you know, being there to have children getting this, I fucked up. I should have said hate instead of don't like, I was trying to be nice. She should have been more definitive. It was just based on one particular and just this weird thing that I, women who don't like kids like, oh, get that kid away. There's something gross about them. I just, it's a weird thing. I've, I find it very, uh, not just distasteful. It's a weird way. Like it's, it's disturbing. It repels me when people like, especially for whatever reason, women hate, well love men too. Now that I have kids, I see a man who doesn't like kids who hates kids and you think about all the abuse that some children suffer a lot of times because of people like that, that hate kids, it becomes very, uh, disturbing to you, especially when you have kids of your own.

Speaker 5:          02:38:21       I'm, I'm totally fine with like I have friends who just don't want to have kids. That's a different thing. Totally. They're just like, we, we want to be able to travel and leverage that. I mean, yeah. So do I love my son and I know you love your kids too, but um, you know, there's some points where me and my wife looked at each other where, you know, I mean, I don't know if you had good sleepers but me, it's like our kids a toddler now and he's still doesn't sleep well, but man, there were times like four o'clock in the morning when he hadn't slept. And I feel like I was just like, there was some hellish fourth dimension that it opened up that I was staring straight into. And I just think, I think, but then that's part of the rites of passage of, of you, of you being a parent.

Speaker 5:          02:38:57       But if there's someone said, I want to, anything to do with that, I'm like, I don't, I don't blame you man. Yeah, sure. Go ahead. Take a pass on this one. We definitely went through periods where you didn't sleep, but I don't, I just don't think there's anything cool about shaming people that don't want to have children. Oh No, there's, there's people that feel like that if you, if they have children, you know, there's something special above and beyond. A person doesn't have children. Like you're never going to get it. You didn't, didn't even grow up [inaudible] side of it. Like, oh, you really couldn't possibly understand what, what we're talking about here. So it's like, oh, play. This guy said this to me once. This guy who was a, uh, just a crazy man, he was a fascinating dude, but he had kids, they were all grown and uh, one of them had been in and out of jail.

Speaker 5:          02:39:42       The other one smoked crack. And, uh, he was mocking this guy who was this musician friend of mine who was in his fifties. He's like, I feel bad for him. He's never had children. I said, why do you feel bad for him? He goes, because he never figured out what life is all about. Light procreating. I'm like, you made criminals. One of your kids or that do you? No one smokes crack criminals. Criminals are fucking dangerous. They are in the morning I leave. They haven't contributed anything to the forwarding of, of, of our species, but in his mind, sure he was better. He was better because he shot a live round, do a woman. She shit out of kid. Amazing. Isn't it? Now does that holier than thou moral high ground that some people take when they have children and I do. You can contribute in amazing amounts of society without ever having a child.

Speaker 5:          02:40:32       I think just as much. It's a different sort of contribution. There's nothing wrong with it. And I, I have a lot of friends that don't ever want to have kids and they're great people and I love them dearly. They love you. You know what I mean? They love kids. That's your thing. It's like people who just, I hate kids. I hate the idea of kids. I don't like seeing them on airplanes. I don't look like them in my airspace in any way, shape or form is, first of all, it's like go live under a rock because I'm not not taking my kid out into the sunlight because your don't like them nearby. Are you a person? Do you like people? Yeah. Well what do you, how do you think they came from? They come to see somebody make a storage bin to existence as you know, 18 year olds or something.

Speaker 5:          02:41:11       Yeah. I just, for whatever reason, I just think that there's some people out there that can't make that connection that like, oh, it's a baby and the baby becomes an adult. I certainly get it a lot more now that I've had kids. Like I like babies, like I see babies. I think they're cute. When I used to see babies before I had kids, I was like, oh, that fucking thing is going to start screaming and I got to get out of here, but I never hated him. No, no, exactly. Yeah. People that do hate them, I find them very disturbing. And you have actually had people, I'm wondering if I've ever run into someone who like basically has said point blank, I hate kids. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. There was a girl I dated. He say that just that I hate kids around them. They, they, they always want too much attention. I was like, wow.

Speaker 5:          02:42:01       I mean, and data for law. But she was, she was angry about a lot of shit. I think her parents were alcoholics to over think. It might've been a little bit of that. She just, I don't know. Who knows? Who knows? Who does know. Yeah. But I, but I, I've, I've never heard it, but I've have had people who are pretty close to intolerance on that level as well, you know? Um, and uh, and I don't, I don't get it either. And I certainly before I had kids, yeah, I'm more comfortable with them now and I'm more, I'm more like sympathetic towards other people who are struggling with their kid out in public. I'm like, Oh fuck. It's too fine to, that is, you're more comfortable. Just as a human being in life, you have some success under your belt. You're not, I mean, even though there is no ultimate comfort, because look, we're finite creatures on a finite planet, finite solar system, and if you don't live in the moment, you're a fool because there, there really is no tomorrow are crumbling. Edifice is, it's only as good as it is today and it's not going to be as good tomorrow as it was today. So Apollo creed in rocky two nailed it. Or three, three, four. Which one was that? There is no tomorrow. Hmm. I'm just trying to, I think he's threatened by Mr too. Yeah, no, he dies and full it for the Russian. The Russian driver. Yes. That's the rocky three doesn't want to train. He's like, well, during the moral,

Speaker 7:          02:43:16       no, tomorrow.

Speaker 5:          02:43:19       Tomorrow when he teaches him how to fight like a black guy. Yeah, that's right. I do remember that. Yes. Rocky three but he's right. There is no tomorrow. There's now and now goes on for long time. But it doesn't go on forever. The only reason why you think it's tomorrow's because the earth is spinning. You can mark it as tomorrow if you really, you really into that. Oh yeah, the winter definitely does come, but there's no tomorrow. So it's just this is this time. You know what I mean? We have a way of measuring it, but it's really ultimately quite fruitless. Yeah, I agree. But there's something about it where it becomes a completely overwhelming for some people it did to defines their very existence. You know, the passage of time, the, I mean I wrote an article for Esquire and it was about, and you would have some knowledge of this basically because it's, it's in MMA is, is hormone replacement therapy or testosterone TRT.

Speaker 5:          02:44:07       And um, and there's this, there's this study, it's called negligible senescence. So senescence is what essence senescence. Great, great, great. Word. Senescence is, is what we're talking about. Negligible Senescence, n. E. S. C. E. N. C. E I think. And it's there, it is negligible senescence and Senescence is, is what you're talking about. It's like our bodies just getting older and things sort of slowly, slowly crumbling and negligible. Senescence is the study of creatures who don't age the way that that humans do like toward tortoises. That's right. Exactly right. The digital Senescence, you look up negligible senescence. You see a turtle? Yup. That's right. The look at the life to live. It's shit. It is quite shit.

Speaker 7:          02:44:50       Yeah. Wander around. Fucking birds pick their babies. Have a fly off with them. It's

Speaker 5:          02:44:56       perfect for a tortoise. The tortoise doesn't know any different I guess, but they did. They'd hate it. Yeah. They would probably be committing suicide those, so they would be cutting their life string short that way. But I think Wales, certain whales have it. See galls of all creatures. Muscles. My fresh water pearl muscles live to be 250 years old and they don't and they don't show this. That's the thing. It's like a five year old muscle. It acts the same as a 200 year old woman. Must. How bout a cohort? A clam. Do you know how old they get? No. 570 years old is the oldest one. They found that old. Yup. I'd be an enormous toward us 255 years. Lobsters, a hundred plus years. Assumably they don't really know until they get, yeah. How about a hydro? Hydro is no, it's kind of snake. Biologically immortal. Biologically immortal.

Speaker 5:          02:45:41       Immortal. It's a genus of small, simple, fresh water. Animals that possess radial symmetry. A Hydra. They're predatory animals belonging to the phylum. Wow. Spell this. C. N. I don't know why you'd put a c and then it does not work. Did you run out of vowels? You Fuck? See, n I. D a R. I. A S Darya and the class hydros. Ah. They can be found in most unpolluted freshwater ponds, lakes and streams in the temperate and tropical regions and can be found gently sweeping. Oh by gently sweeping and collecting net through weedy areas. They are multicellular organisms, which are usually a few meters long and are best studied with a microscope, but they are immortal. That's amazing. What an interesting yeah. Phenomenon. I never would've thought that enters their lives. Shit. Yeah, that's the, yeah, exactly. They're just a squiggle around in the weeds. That's, that's the punishment. Sorta be like, hell yeah.

Speaker 5:          02:46:42       It's like a reconstituted, shitty child. Molesters become hydras in their next life. They just get swept up and fucking dirty fish. I'm not a mortal, have a fishy to you. But that started the idea of TRT is then that the proponents say that, you know, you're, you're, you're not going to live forever. Of course, that's not the body that we've been gifted by, you know, by, by nature. But you know, most when you talk to guys, and I talked to guys. Yeah, I used my father as, you know, my dad's 65 now 66 and he's like, I don't want to live forever. Of course I just want to be able to be, to carry groceries up to my house when I'm 80. I want to have that sort of quality of life for as long as I can. And then when that whole house comes down, let it come down immediately.

Speaker 5:          02:47:28       You know what I mean? Well, that's wishful thinking. It is quite honestly. But you certainly can manipulate your hormones to give you a decided advantage over non manipulated people. It becomes a real issue in mixed martial arts because of course we, uh, Brendan Schaub who a is on the podcast, the fighter and the kid with my friend Brian Cowen, he's a fighter in the UFC and he said it best and he said, what's wrong with TRT when it comes to competitive sports is that there's an advantage of youth and there's an advantage of wisdom and wisdom comes with age and with experience and with years and years of study and practice and that, that advantage sort of in some way there's sort of a point of diminishing returns where it cancels out youth and experience, whether it's at 35 or whether it's a 37 when does the tip back towards youth again?

Speaker 5:          02:48:18       Well, when you start supplementing the hormones with testosterone, it doesn't, and then you get guys like Vito Bell for of course, 36 37 years old. Fucking everybody up because they're got muscles and the teeth now because he's taking testosterone. What about like Dan Henderson? See, I feel like that's one where he's like forced to go into like wars with guys who are 15, even 20 years, his, his, uh, younger than him and I feel like, you know what I mean? But that, but then you know, people of the people that I grew up watching as boxers didn't, you know, you just had to keep throwing yourself into that fray and if your body is collapsing around you, that's the choice that you've made. Well, he's not on testosterone anymore that it was abolished. It, it's no longer allowed in the, you are no longer alive and most athletic commissions, even worldwide have ceased. These of it, Brazil stopped. So it becomes

Speaker 6:          02:49:08       really fucking interesting, especially in Brazil because in Brazil you can buy steroids and a lot of stores you can buy them over the counter like you can. In Mexico you don't have to have prescriptions. I don't know if they've changed that in Brazil. I know they have it in Mexico. In Mexico, people go and buy like fucking Viagara. They go by percosets. They could buy all kinds of shit down there. A lot. In a lot of ways, but they just have different regulations when it comes to pharmaceutical drugs and, and, and, and steroids. Um, but in the UFC you cannot have testosterone replacement. No one can have it anymore. So it's really interesting also because these people that have been taking it for x amount of years, they've depleted their system. They've sort of shut their own endogenous production down. I think there's, there's too many negatives to it.

Speaker 6:          02:49:57       There's too many negatives to it as far as for athletic competition. And one of the big ones is I have a Dr. Mark Gordon, who's a friend of mine who is a expert on traumatic brain injury. And it says, one of the big issues is you have to find out what is it that's causing this depletion of their natural source of testosterone. Is it just old age? Which is one possibility. Another possibility is traumatic brain injury and cutting their testosterone. Absolutely. I never, well, he scared the fuck out of me, man. His, uh, his take on traumatic brain injury is so studied and you know, he's, he's been involved in assisting football players and athletes of concussion. Yeah. A lot of them who have had, you know, really dramatic changes because of head trauma and the way he describes it, it's like you never know what it's going to be that does it.

Speaker 6:          02:50:44       It could be you go jet skiing one day and you know, just the bouncing on the water and something's wrong and your brain and then your body shuts down his testosterone, your libido drops and you're not aware. You just feel like you feel depressed. The bottom dropped out of me or something. And then you go to the doctor, I'm depressed. They put you on antidepressants. I mean, it's like, and what he's finding is that the pituitary gland is incredibly sensitive to trauma. And so obviously that when you're dealing with a sport that one of the big goals is to shut the brain down with impacts, you know, with, with, uh, a strike, like giving them testosterone so that it negates the effects of brain trauma. Sort of like just masks the real issue that's going on. So it's not as simple as their body getting older and they need testosterone to live in a nice quality of life.

Speaker 6:          02:51:35       It's a matter of medication that sort of overrides this issue where, you know, they're getting, they're getting their brain fuck. Yeah. Yeah. So I think, uh, and I also think it's too many. It's too much possibility of cheating. Yeah. I think there's that too. I mean, I interviewed, um, what's it, Keith Kaiser. Yes. And he said that basically said the same thing. It's just not. Um, and you know, of course my editor wanted me to look at the sports side of a thing and I did. And I think there were some really interesting stuff to be, to be found on that side of it. And I come down on,

Speaker 5:          02:52:06       on your side too. I mean, just like we've been having combat sport events since Greek and Roman times. Um, yeah. I mean, of course you don't want to, some people would say, well listen, we also fix MCL and ACL is, and we're able to do great things with medicine. So, you know what I mean? Like why not take the advancement, these benefits that we have and if TRT is one of them, but I, but I do think there's, there's the fairness to the sport, but when I just, before I left the hotel, I saw commercial where it's like an underarm now you just go in the morning, you just swipe it on and you had about your day. So like just for not sports taken out of it, just generally, um, from my, what I've read the research that I've done, which was just in service of that article, um, you know, I, I wouldn't, I like I'm more or less said if my dad wanted to use it, I would be like, listen, if it works, uh, and if you try it, you know what I mean?

Speaker 5:          02:52:56       Uh, uh, you know, and it makes some benefit to your life. You know, I'd be like, of course I'd be all for it. It's really the tip of the iceberg when it comes to manipulating the human. This essentially a low level form of genetic engineering and what you're going to be able to do instead of introducing these synthetic hormones into your system, which are going to be able to do, is they're going to have nanobots that repair tissue. They're going to have your, your your body's ability to recuperate. A lot of people don't understand what, what hormones do and the, the various different roles that they play on your body, but a hormone doesn't necessarily make you bigger. What makes you bigger is it, it makes you, when you take testosterone, it makes you recover quicker. And one of the ways guys can cheat is that they can work harder and they can put in more time because the recovery is shorter because they take these, these hormones and they can put in these intense and insane sessions in the gym and they'll be fresh as a daisy in the morning, whereas the other person has to sort of will themselves to get up and through hard work and determination can really put in the time and get better the traditional way.

Speaker 5:          02:54:03       Um, so that, that's, that's considered cheating. I agree. Yeah. But one day they're going to have fucking male men who are on these nanobots. That's right. Some form of genetic [inaudible] man for 300 years, cause he just keeps reject. That's another thing I did. There's a guy, Aubrey de grey. Yes. I know that guy. Right. Okay. So he basically just says that your whole body can be replaced slow. And he says, look at it like a car. Yeah. But I feel like there was some part of me that thought just as a fiction writer, like I don't know if I'd want to see a 2000 year old person. They smell like they smell. They had like like old papery flesh shirt, hot as fuck. What do they look like? John Jamison in their prime, but they smell like Barbara Walters so you couldn't get rid of the century. Kind of a would just be too, too weird.

Speaker 5:          02:54:47       Yeah, we're going to, we're running out of time, but that wouldn't be something that you would really have to think about, man. It was. If you get, if we get to a pert, a point where people are a mortal, there's going to be that thing where they're like, they go, what's, is there a next? Should I just let this die off? And there's going to be people that do decide to just keep going and going, but I feel like you'd lose all your family and friends and all. Yeah. You're all 2000 year old. You get annoyed with each other for eternity. Yeah, exactly. Listen, man, this is a fascinating conversation. I really enjoyed it. Thank you very much. Let me know when you're new book comes out.
