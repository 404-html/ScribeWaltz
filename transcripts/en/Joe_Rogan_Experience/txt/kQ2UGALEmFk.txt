Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Oh, we're live. Will you guys betting on look, look around real quick. Do you know what's new? Hm? Easy. It's easier than you think. Bruce Lee. Bruce Lee. Yeah, but still. But still though. He didn't say it. He goes, I wonder if he'll say rise. He gets out. I said, no, I should have bet you money. I was going to say it this way. You've seen it right away. No, I saw it immediately. Pretty Dope. That is dope. Just sent those in. This guy's a bad motherfucker. Plastic. Sell this shit. There's a great. As a great hip hop album I listened to in high school and they use one of his quotes, one of my favorites. He says, honestly, expressing oneself is really hard to do. I can use. I can use really fancy movements and show you really crazy things, but to honestly express myself, that is really hard to do.

Speaker 1:          00:00:48       It's a. it's like a beautiful little sound clip before they start the song, but it's like just him talking to someone isn't an humbling when someone dies really young like he does and they did way more in their life than you ever will. Makes me sad. I'm like, what am I going to do? You stop and think about it. Like who the fuck else has had that kind of an impact and you know, he died in what, 1970 something in the seventies. Yeah. And he was young. Yeah, I think he was like 30 or 31 or 32 or something like that. Find out how old Bruce Lee was when he died. It's not like I was listening to Hendrix last night on the way the studio or a lot of the comedy store. You have one of my 33 and he died when he was 27.

Speaker 1:          00:01:30       How much Hendrix music is there out there and he died when he was 27 here. But then you think, do you think he'd be happy with what's going on? Like I always find that like what would they be doing today? That trips me up. Yeah. Well you can't do that. No, I know, but that'll be like, oh, they had such like a because right. There's guys that lasted a long time and they either like or making garbage or they're slowly still making cool shit here and there whenever they want to. Yeah. There's the variety. So. And then there's people that just, nobody wants to hear their new shit. Right. It's like the rolling stones. Yeah. You're like, Nah, start me up. Come on. Nobody wants to hear like new rolling stones. One's called car tire. Don't play that. Don't play that. Isn't that weird though?

Speaker 1:          00:02:11       Because they're all time greats. Yeah. But if they started playing some song you haven't heard, you're like, fuck is all this. That's kind of like A. Yes. Yesterday I was, when I was running, they had this thing called the big three. It's a, it's a post NBA League for players to play in once, once I retire it was just three on three, but it's really sad to watch guys that have been retired for like 10 years who've been because you're like, this is just bad. It's like, it's like say you want to just remember them when they were amazing, but now they're just old, too old to be. It's like, it's like circusy, you know what I mean? Like people are showing up just to like see those names, but they're there. It's really bad to watch how old they are. I mean there is no minimum.

Speaker 1:          00:02:51       I just think it's, you have to be retired from the league to play in it. But like, I mean the average age has got to be 40. Maybe seat. It depends on the. And the athlete. Like Hopkins was fighting in his forties at his best. Different though. Yeah. Basketball is just, it's such a young man's game. I mean it was boxing. I know, but there's something about it that's like a hard to watch and I'll do with gray hair missing free throws. That's a weird guy who used to be phenomenal. I understand what you're saying, but I disagree in the fact that it's even sadder watching an old guy get the fuck beat out. Used to be good. Yeah. That's sad. That's sad. But fighting. But. But he's still probably fights because he loves it. No, no, just for the money. It's for money. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:03:35       I mean they fight because they love the competition, but they get paid. They're doing it from us. But these guys are doing the big three. There's no way they enjoy it anymore. Oh, how do you know? There's no way. It just looked so sad. So sad. Do you think that. I think with basketball too, it's wear and tear on the knees so that your back, your knees, everything left. Right? Left. Right when you walked. There's a guy named Glen Davis, Big Baby Davis and he was. He always had like big problems in league being so heavy on his, on his knees and his back and it's even worse there. He fell once during it and rolled around for like five minutes. I was like, this is so sad to watch like this. And their cameras are just focusing on him. And rapaport is doing the announcing. Michael Rob Portman. Man, he's doing.

Speaker 1:          00:04:14       He's doing the interview. It's so weird, man. It's so weird. He's like a 80 year old, 20 year old yet. He's just, his career is on this crazy revival train and it's almost like he is going back to young rappaport style. He's a funny dude, man. Oh, he's hilarious. Interviewing. Um, I guess it was, I forget what it was, but he was interviewing these guys and he's like Kinda hunched over, like talking to him and he's a big guy and he's got this look on his face. He's interviewed them. Like this is such a weird combination of like an old guy at a young guy. Yeah, yeah, yeah. He, but he, but he's connected with the youth so heavily. Oh yeah. Well he did that, but things. He did that documentary for a tribe called quest, like he still wants. He still is in like that, that youthful world of like music and sports.

Speaker 1:          00:05:03       And do you ever see the rent that he went on after Charlottesville? But those Tiki torch carrier and white guy did Tiki torch motherfuckers, but he's loose, you know, I mean he's out there. He's, he's very funny on the fighter and the kid too. He goes on, he's hysterical and he, you know, he goes and he fights with the whole Howard stern staff. He loves fight with those guys because they all do like fantasy football and all that stuff. He's, he's vocally a massive sports fan, which I think him that keeps him in that youth circle so much that he just loves sports and loves talking sports to everybody. Yeah. He hosts sports shows sometimes, like he's hosted different peoples. One of those radio TV shows, those radio shows. They constantly, they show on TV occasionally. One of those who does those. They're like a Dan.

Speaker 1:          00:05:49       Patrick and Patrick has one. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Those are the guys that left espn. I don't know Jack Shit about sports man. Yeah, you do. I don't know about sports that you know about, but that's all I know about. Like the problem is people try to talk to me about other sports because I fucking believe that game. Like that's everybody. Like some like Ian Edwards loved soccer. I can't tell you. I couldn't tell you a position other than goalie. Yeah. You named one forward. See, but I think that then I think about hockey because I'm like, I know hockey, but I had no idea about isn't talking to the same soccer just with like know very close. They're pretty close as a midfielder. Did Senator Defense forward and defense? Yeah. Are They all defense? SORTA when you're on defense? Yeah. Same as hockey. I can't. I'm sorry I couldn't.

Speaker 1:          00:06:38       I was in Italy when the World Cup was going on and it was amazing to watch Europeans watched that shit because they love it rather go crazy. Check the APP. Totally checked out. I was talking about this before would ruin it for me. It was. I was in boulder when the World Cup was happening and these dorky white guys pretending to be way too enthusiastic about the World Cup dude. Because the World Cup. Yeah. You know, it's that thing not into it. He knew that fake thing that people do. They're like fucking yes, but it's not real. The Olympics does that to. The Olympics has this thing when people get into like, it's cool to cheer for your country or whatever, but it's so funny when people get into the Olympics and they're like, do you watch us and lose? Did you watch us rip it up and loose? No, I don't fucking why?

Speaker 1:          00:07:18       What are you talking about? That's not where we rip it up. Was I asleep? We were fucking shit up and loose yesterday. I didn't know. I had no idea. Like the Winter Olympics, everyone freaks out and they have sports that you would never even think about wanting to watch. Like the cross country ski and then you shoot on the ground in the ski some more. You would never. I would never do again through basketball is going to be in the summer Olympics. Is it really? This big three thing is a big three. That's it. That's the. That's the big three is the three on three tournament we were talking about with the ex NBA players, but wait a minute, they put them in an Olympics. Yeah, dude, I looked this up and I was so surprised. I was like, what the fuck? I don't even, I don't know what kind of competition it's going to be, but the big three success has led to it being included in the next summer Olympic.

Speaker 1:          00:08:04       How many people are in a normal basketball game? Ten, five and five. Five on five. This three on three and it's half court and they have a four point shot, which doesn't exist it. Yeah. So you could shoot it. I have a weird rule to it at once. It gets down to four minutes that like there are no, I'm sorry. This was the basketball tournament has a weird Rolando. I just confuse the two things. There's another tournament going on which is like amateur players and teams and it's a $1,000,000 tournament taste. Actually 2 million, 2 million bucks. So it's a tournament going on all across the country. We could have edited if we wanted to. We should. Would have lost, but we wouldn't it be fun. Just don't talk negative to me bro Bro. You don't know my heart. You know we would have been trading goes on of my head Bro. This former NBA guys, former college players, whatever broke. Don't put limitations on us. We would have had an average height of five, 10. We'd be killing, but they have six, nine black dudes. And these three white heads just. Hey, we're here to play. Hi fellas. Hey guys. Just tying my shoes. So, um, what are the rules?

Speaker 1:          00:09:12       There's a four point. Oh, Joe just hugs the ball. Just started fucking head money people out of the way. Why can't we do that? Why can, why can't we play like that guys, you got to go. Well, we tried. I don't have any sports skills. I don't know if you fell out, so maybe you could just use you as the bowl and fall out. You just feel what happens when you fall out. You kick you out, you're done. You can't play anymore else other than this. Then the game's over now. But they have two other players on their bench that they rotate. Oh Jesus. But we would have you fall as hard as you can to really fuck up their best players. Oh, you know what I mean? That strategy. And then Jamie and I would have to bang it out way to Dickie. Do they have that?

Speaker 1:          00:09:48       They have that in hockey. The NBA, same thing. The Mba and guys get pissed because it ruins their career. It costs millions of dollars. I mean heck heck. A shack was the original, like they used to foul shack so because they knew what would they can do to stop him. He's a fucking truck, so he would just get the ball. They would tomahawk them as hard as they could. Oh my God. Yeah man. It was. And he used to complain about it. It was funny because because you know, couch sports fans are always like, oh, shut the fuck up. You're huge. You have no idea how he. He is big. But another huge dude that's just throwing their arms as hard as they can all gain duty. He gets totally fucked up from that. Wow. Your handcuffs check was like the. He was like the beginning. It happened before that old NBA people will be like, that's bullshit. They didn't the 70, but Shaq was just the biggest guy that's ever played with so much agility. Whenever I shake his hand, I'm like, what is that? It's absurd. It's like a desk. It's like shit.

Speaker 1:          00:10:41       He's like, hey man, what's up Joe? He did fear factor with me and him. Him and I were like, he was a huge fear factor fan. So he did like a whole episode where he co hosted it with me and he stood next to me and he like, he would do this. I'm going to do to Carol Boone. Shocker ta, Ta. And when he would do the countdown, almost standing next to him like this is like an eight year old hanging out with his. His Dad. Oh all I hear stories like that that he's like, he's a big kid on set. They can like, you can't stop fucking around. I felt an eight year old nephew who grown up pig. Yeah. He's so, he's a big kid. That's all I ever hear. Anybody that works with him. Like he fucked. He loves fucking around. He loves not taking it serious.

Speaker 1:          00:11:21       Super Fun guy. Very friendly. No, he's so dynamic. He's like a cop. Yeah. He, he wants to do undercover work for in Miami or something. Right. Workflow for Lord or some shit like that. He, he, uh, he would be involved in raids and Shit and pretty hard to be undercover when you're 6:11 black dude. He's, he's got to be one of the biggest guys it's ever played, right. Not the tallest, but probably one of the most. Probably the most mass. Yeah. And Muscle. I mean, you know, when you get up next to his arm, it's, it's, it's this, it's like two of my thighs. He got into MMA for awhile. Did the, I don't know if he's doing it. Yeah, training, but there was videos of him training and I'm just like, look, if there was no weight limitations, a key. So got, look at him.

Speaker 1:          00:12:08       So fucking big. That does look like a man in his buddy. Yeah. Child child and a grown man. Yeah. I have a picture. I have a picture of me at the MTV. Was it at movie awards or something like that with him next to me and where I was interviewing him for this thing and he will always be the roast one of the road, a Bieber and I'm in and I'm doing this with a microphone, like full extension with it and he's bending down still. You still have to doug? I'm like it checked. It's kind of weird that like the UFC has a weight limit. What's the top out to 65? Yeah. Isn't that weird? Yeah. Why is that? I don't know. Does it get these super heavy, super heavy? We've never had a super heavy fight, but super heavyweight is to 65 and above. Well, who's the heaviest fighter that's ever fought to 65 when they weigh in after that, probably brock brock was cut and wait to make to 65. Wasn't he around 300 pounds? That. That's fucking insane. And it's a different kind of 300 pounds to 37 foot one.

Speaker 1:          00:13:12       His shoes are 22, 22. They're almost to. His foot is two feet. That's his foot. That's all fucking bit. Yeah. His foot to two feet, Jesus, but like a guy like that could never fight in the UFC because you probably can't make two 65. No. If he did, he'd be fucking zero. Zero fat. I want. But I wonder about how because he's so big. He didn't have to lose 75 pounds. Right? Is it? They say 3:30. Is that what he weighed? Yeah, 3:30. It looked like as a rookie. Oh my God. He was so big. So big. And he's a kid right there, by the way. He's. He's 20 or 19 or 20 years old, right? That God. Damn. That's crazy. It's a fucking full grown man at 20. I mean, what? Did you ever see this? Do you ever see the movie blue chips?

Speaker 1:          00:13:56       Do you ever see that? No. That's a great movie. What she like about, about Shaq mcnulty, he's recruiting him. Shaq. Yeah. It's fun. It's a phenomenal book. You would have. You would love old tea. What? How good is that guy? Oh, that's awesome. Oh, he's so good in this fucking movie. You know what? He's amazing in. It wasn't even a good movie, but that movie warrior ever that. Oh yeah, he's fucking cook. So the movie wasn't that good. It was flawed. Yeah. But he's good. You Know Brian Coulombs in that movie, he played me, literally did my role in the UFC and that movie. Oh yeah. He, the, he's the announcer. He was telling me this. I'm just going to. Do you want to pretend I'm you? Except for like the skill and the talent and all that stuff. Burn. Listen, I'm coming after you. You son of a bitch. Fight me Brian. There he is right there. But Nick Nolte, ds in that fucking movie.

Speaker 2:          00:14:52       Nick naulty plays the dad of one of the guys that's fighting and dairy is like total fucking. I ran into him once, man at FRY's. I was so happy that he knew my name because he used to date Vicky Lewis, who's a friend of mine. She was on news radio. Very talented girl. She's that girl. Extremely talented. She's young, Huh? Vicky? Not Anymore. Compared to him though, because that was a big age gap. It was a big age gap. But um, so I knew him from the set, you know, he'd come to the set and hanging out and I'm going to fry's and he's got his reading glasses on and I said, hey nick, what's up? He'll told Joe, I'm only, I'm trying to get a computer from my kid. Things that's really good. Hey Joe. It was weird. It's like I'm talking to nick naulty. Should I get a Mac? So I was only like 27. They'll still confused. I'm still like, I can't believe I'm really talking to Nick Nolte ended up right now. No real. This is real. We're at FRY's.

Speaker 2:          00:15:50       Hey Man. Nicknames Electronics too. That was during my um, my quake days when I was addicted to quake and I'd make my own computers. You, you did all that shit. I'll do 15 screens and all that shit. Like everyone does that. I had a room in my house where it had a, like a conference table and it was lined up with computer monitors and computers. I used to build computers. But you play, you don't play any games anymore while we're going to. We just got, when we set up his origin pcs, we got to land room, set up local area. Network Room. Oh Shit. Oh Shit. All over the world. Fire down. Well, you know what man, now that we have the studio, there's so much room here and my kids come here and play too. You know, there's plenty of stuff to do. Yeah, this is a lot.

Speaker 2:          00:16:36       Lots of. So I'm just going to fuck it. Put some games on for them, put some games on for me. Yeah, that works. I never got. I never got into it for some reason. Video Games, like I loved him when I was a kid and then there was this weird cutoff then I was growing up now. But so many people still play. Yeah, the non grownups, those, those non growing up guy. But I wish I could play like I shamed me looking at him over there. He's a sweet kid. Ultimate watershed. It's like ultimate warrior shirt is fully grown. Mad Chicks love ultimate warrior. Did they love guys to play video games too, right? Yeah. To sit inside all day. Fuck yes dude. Like just putting out just I want to get pale more pale. I want to Paler and Paler. Jamie the Paler. You know what scares the shit out of me though. Those multi role player, what does it multi those giant role player go to work and I call them border. What's the name? Massively massive multiplayer online role playing. Is that what fortnight is? No, I sound like a fucking dad. They'll laugh at me shooter. It's a third person. Third Person. That's their parents, but isn't there but aren't you with a massive community of people? Yeah. People. Yeah. Yeah. That's fucking 100 people in the game with you. That's a lot to. Yeah, well that's a death match.

Speaker 1:          00:17:50       A quake death match. A lot of times you're not really a hundred, but it can be 100. 100. Seems like it's absurd. How many people are on your squat, on your team up to four. Oh, 50 on 50 match. Which is like a special. Is it random assignments to teams or you go in picking your team or you can. You actually can go in random to it. You can do everything you want. God, I can't wait to hear the comments on this video, but I do not know about fort night. Dude, I'm so mad that I have idea. I see so many references online to it and I know what it is, but I have no idea what it is. I remember when people would call you a noob and they used to for ohs. Yeah, new fucking knew. It still goes on. Does it still goes on?

Speaker 1:          00:18:32       Shit. Like today, they're like brave. Even right now there's $2,000,000 tournaments going on. There's one there. I think they're both for charity today, but one for fortnight and then another one another. Again, that's just like a called [inaudible], which we've talked about before, a million bucks. How long do they have to play? It might be like a two or three hour tournament. That's fucking unreal. So much money in video games now. Parents used to tell their kids and not play video games like you don't. Don't be a loser and they still have that shit in their head, but it's. There's more money in it. Then like most games, then you make people make careers out of it. What if there were a tennis player? Oh, bobby's a pro tennis player, but will might blow his fucking ankles out timmy. Over there I was making a billion dollars playing fortnite hands.

Speaker 1:          00:19:13       Yeah. This all day. I do it all at Iowa guys. I got a friend of my old roommate, my first roommate in La. He was like a PR professional online Gamer, and I thought I was like, what? That dude fatality reached out to us, Jonathan Wendell tonality. I'm going to try to get them on. I figured out he's still playing. He was the greatest quick player or one of the. It's hard to say. It's hard to say the greatest. There was a few of those guys. He was one of them. How old is he now? Probably in his late thirties. Something like that. Yeah, that sounds great. What is he doing? I always know what the. I want to know what they do when they quit all that shit. Just just breathe. Just chilling, trying to figure out how to deal with all the radiation they'd been absorbing. He's working at FRY's, sat in front of that screen is.

Speaker 1:          00:19:58       Hi Joe. All your cells are mutated. Some of them now I think. I think some of them are smart enough now that they realized the uh, how quick arises and how quick the fall might be that they're just sort of banking money and just riding it out to see how long it goes. Yeah. But it's Kinda like Kinda like how engulf you only get paid paid if you win. Now not a lot of these guys can bank all that money. Right? They still got to have something to do after it's done. That's the best bank. But time majority of guys are just making a lady I just said, and this the way. It's different though. They don't have to pay a coach. They don't. They're just at home in their part. In some cases their parent's house still most cases where it might just by their parent's new house. That might be their goal. They buy their parents house and kick them the fuck out that's happening by their parent's house. The. Yeah. You remember when you were playing video games, Mike? Getting the fuck out and take care of in with you. Pack our shit up too.

Speaker 1:          00:20:49       Ryan's kicking us out. Yeah. Get the fuck out. You should have been so mean to him. Yeah. Know the mom's bitching at him. I didn't fucking know he could have bought us this nice. Tom Toughening them up. His wife became such a good player twice when they're fucking assholes. They take credit for it. Did that toughened you up and that's why you liked this? Like a UC I tonya. No I didn't and I can't do that. But that's what that is. Is it? Her mom was, you saw that shit of her mom was fucking atrocious. And then when every time she got something she's like, you know why that is because I made you that way. So she, she mind fucked her her whole life into being like even at her, even when she, even after the, after the incident, you know, even after the Kerrigan thing, she was like, I was always the one that made you the killer.

Speaker 1:          00:21:41       That's why we do this. Oh she fucked her. So I mean she fucked with her head. So deep. Someone she was boxing. Oh yeah man. Tonya harding was boxed. They talk about it unboxed and hope she bucks here. And I was his coach. She was actually all right. She looked all right. Well she's an athlete man. Yeah, like a legit. And when she bulked up to I remember and she was doing it because she was trying to cash check because she lost all her money, man. She lost all her machine. Made much. And what do you think she does now? They talk about at the end of the film and I don't remember. They tell you where, you know, when they're like in the Chi, run with it, like she lives in so and so with her new husband and none of them. She'll never talk to Jeff Gillooly again.

Speaker 1:          00:22:19       And who's Jeff Gillooly? The Guy, her boyfriend, the one that was like the head Nancy Kerrigan's legs work the. He is the kingpin. Jesus Christ. That's a dark thing to do, man. To have some fucking Dumbo. And the way they describe it, the movie, it's even funnier that the guy. He's the guy is he hires are fucking brain dead. Fucking brain dead dudes. Imagine thinking there's nothing go wrong with that plan. That plan is going to go off. They they claim in the movie and then their story I think to the courts were always. They were supposed to threaten her and these two dumbbells went up there and they were like, yeah, we'll threatened her. And they were like, no, no. Threatened her. You're like her. They fucking shows up with a police baton. You believe that? No Dude, no chance, no chance. You know what I believe? I believe if I'm going to believe that guy side, I bet he said, go up there and and scare and do what you need to do. Right? I bet he left it vague and was like, these fucking idiots. We'll figure it out. I bet they were on meth and there were all good. Yeah. Fucking geeked out.

Speaker 1:          00:23:17       Yeah. They're all just geeking out going, dude. You know what? Fucking skaters need. Knees will fuck up her knees and they're just like, yeah, I'm taking a math. Did you see the video? That guy who drove into the parking lot of the comedy store and smash into a car and almost hit one of the guys that were there. When was this real recently? Some fucking dude tweaked out of his mind. He came driving through the back of the parking lot in the store during the day, slammed into a car, slammed into one of the employees because it was parked back there. They got security camera footage of

Speaker 2:          00:23:45       it. Guys are jumping out of the way. This guy's just like completely out of his mind. Holy Shit. It turns out the guy, um, years ago killed a kid driving. Yeah. Slammed his car into some fucking kid and killed him like a young girl. Fuck. And then many years later is still driving fucked up. Holy Shit. Tried to back out. Tried to get out of there. That stopped. Grabbed him? Yeah. What is this? This the guy arrested after vehicle collision at the comedy store? Yeah. That guy killed a kid driving and he's still doing it. He killed. He was peeling off a sunset and it smashed into the comedy store. He was out of his mind, man out of his mind, came in sideways, went around the corner, and we went through the driveway, went around the corner to the lot and came in like literally turned sideways and slammed into a car.

Speaker 2:          00:24:35       What the fuck drugs do to the wrong kind of drugs or who knows what kind of pills that's fucking assholes on, but that same guy had killed a kid. He's still driving like that pump. Imagine. Imagine you kill a kid driving fucked up. You get out of jail and then you're still doing it. Yeah. What the fuck? He's not even that old. He looked at me. He looked like a lot of young. Here's the thing, man. Somebody made that kid so many made that kid. Somebody somebody fuck somebody and the man, the woman got together, they got pregnant, the girl got pregnant, gave birth. Raise that kid and this is what you got. What a bad deal. But you can't tell me that. That's not part of their fault too. There's got to be some shit that they fucking did have that kid. Yeah. Oh, for sure.

Speaker 2:          00:25:17       There's got to be something. I mean, that's a. that's a collective effort. You get someone that's that fucking stupid that you kill a kid and you don't learn like that's not enough of a lesson. You're still driving fucked up. How did Caitlin Jenner get away with killing that dude? What was the turned into a woman that was the best? Just slice off your Dick. That's it. If us, they can't get. You know what it is, man. In this day and age, it's like she entered into this category of the most marginalized group in America currently, which is transgender people and doing that by becoming a transgender person. That became the entire focus of the nation. She got exonerated for all of these things though, so I wasn't paying attention and she slammed into the back. All we can say he because it was still a Bruce Jenner. He slammed into the back of this person's car.

Speaker 2:          00:26:09       It was a dude, but it was a single. Oh, it was a woman. Woman slammed into an old lady and pushed her into traffic. Fuck. Than they hit a car with a family of five members. Two kids and a grandma and way they live the same family, but the grandma sued because she like broke her hip and pelvis or something like 79 year old woman. Yeah. It's a fucked up story and it was almost like it just disappeared. Crazy thing is Caitlin doesn't even address it. Like it's like some horrific moment in their life. No, completely irresponsible, but it shows you the type of person. Do you ever see Kyle Dunnigan staying on it? Nigger, it's

Speaker 1:          00:26:44       the funniest. But have you ever see the one he did on that will engender CBF finance? Oh No. Where he's driving fucking fucked up and killed that lady. But now Caitlin has got a clean record. Hey Dude. Done again. That is such a fucking hysterical character character that he does on his instagram everyday. I watched that shit. Yeah, here it is.

Speaker 1:          00:27:25       Look, I just hit a retarded kid. He's such an odd guy. I love it. He's very, very funny. That's where that comes from, man. There's beauty in that fucking oddity. Oh, I love that. Well, he found his groove groove is instagram with face swap. Yup. He's brilliant. He's got the funniest instagram page by far. I do. When he fucks with his mom, it makes me. It kills. Maybe you seen him do that, Craig, is that. Guess what? Guess what? Get she. You can tell she's so fucking. She's on the phone like on a business call and she's like, I'm on the phone. He doesn't give a fuck. He keeps bugging. It's so funny, man. Chicken. But it does it. That great character. You know, people are mad at him for that Craig character. Why? Of course, with the flux new. He's being an ableist. Oh my God. Oh my list. You being unable list passed by chick fil a new chick filet near me this morning. Uh, the vegans are protesting.

Speaker 1:          00:28:33       Sorry,

Speaker 4:          00:28:41       I'm just fixing the painting. Painting the dough on that doesn't make any sense.

Speaker 1:          00:28:51       You haven't even seen it yet. Maybe you'll like it better.

Speaker 4:          00:28:57       Sure. Does the smartstack much. I'm just going to cut out the cookie. Men look pretty much the same

Speaker 1:          00:29:27       drugs did school. I wish it hadn't every podcast here that sell drugs to school. Oh my God. These kids. That kills it. Kills me every fucking time already. So funny man. Every time you post something with that, great fuck. It rips me up. But it's funny how he found this niche and that, that this, this new thing of like face swap with a character. It's Pr. It's perfect. Well, it's perfect because his impressions are so good. Oh, that's so fucking Bill Maher is insane. Oh my God. It's so good. It's really creepy when I see. When you see it, you're like, that's bill Maher behind the face. Swap doing the voice when he does the Kim and Kanye talking, talking to each other with Caitlin. Yeah. It's brilliant, man. He's a fucking. He. He found he found the perfect group, but I love the fact that there's this new thing that people can do. You know, the, this face swap thing is like a completely new way of doing sketches, making characters. Yeah. It's wild. It's almost funny earlier because you know that he's behind it. You know what I mean? It's like you're in on it so you know, but yet it's so good. Like when he does like Kim and Kanye West,

Speaker 5:          00:30:37       Dad, dad, I'm lost in my house. Oh Shit, look around you. What do you say? There's a washing machine is a weird white box. What is that white box? But it's so perfect. It's like clueless family that's so wealthy that they completely detached from. What is that white box? Really mad now

Speaker 1:          00:31:05       I just love that these technologies created. There's a bunch of youtube people that do that. They're doing ladies weird youtube videos. There's so many people doing it now, but it's like he but he's found a, like a real specifically funny niche because he's. Because he's related to the characters, like a lot of times when people are thrown characters together and sketches and they're just kinda so cheaply done and they don't have any. Like they don't mean comedic base that just like weird to be fucking goofy and it's like, ah, you got to have some kind of basement. There's a few people that do it right. My kid loves this lady, Miranda sings. Do you know that? That is. She's this. She's got this show called the fuck. We'll show a picture. Miranda sings. Yeah. I think that's her name. Isn't that her name? What does she do?

Speaker 1:          00:31:47       I try to get her on the podcast. Did Not respond at all. That's so fun. Do it just for my daughter. She's so into this lady's show, but it's a show that's not for kids. That's her. It's a weird show. Like the show. I'm like. She had. She had a Netflix show. She. Yeah. Is it over?

She does that voice, that voice that she does to show like. It's almost like a tim and Eric type show. It's not really a show for eight year olds. It's just a mind fuck show. Yeah. So I'm like letting her watch and like, I don't even think you should be watching this, but then again she lives with me. Yeah, no shit. He's going to say what? But what did you watch that you knew you shouldn't have been watching when you were a kid? To try to not swear for the first five years of their life and then I'm like, impossible. Stop. My wife would get mad. I'm like, what are they going to learn about something early? He has a shit. I'm nice. They'll just showcasing I say shit or fuck, what's the big deal?

Speaker 2:          00:33:26       I don't say like, I'm going to fuck you to my wife. I'm real. Fuck you lady. I don't say that in front of your kids are eating dinner. I'm going to fuck your late night. I'm fucking you guys. Your mom fucking ghetto. I made you. You're upset. It's how I fucking made you. That's where you came from. My Duck. There was a moment when my daughter was three. We were skiing and we packed up all the stuff. We're getting ready to leave, but we didn't pack up her helmet and so we got all that stuff back. We got everything. Got Everything. Oh, the helmet. I go, we haven't packed the helmet and my three year old daughter looks at the helmet, looks at her bag and goes, shit, that's great. But there's a moment where like, oh no. And we're laughing, but we try not to look at it like, Oh, turn it away laughing.

Speaker 2:          00:34:14       Listen. It's like those videos on the Internet. Always funny when there's a kid trying to say duck and they're like, what is he like, fuck, fuck. And you're like, it's fine. I don't give a fuck. It's funny. There was no way the parent can't not laugh, but he's like, fuck the fuck. And they're like, yeah, the dog is a girl told me he tried to kiss his son is his three year old and he's like, he goes up, like give daddy a kiss and it says no, no, no push. He pushes him away. But as he pushes him away, says push. No, no, no. Push, push, push, push, push, push. Get away from me. Homo Baghdad. Push Push. What are you going to make? Little Sandino's try and man, are you shooting some loads in there pumping? Why not? Why not? What's the difference? Live rounds.

Speaker 2:          00:35:01       So you guys doing the thing where you like checking the calendar should have. So that's such a weird thing too. I think it's a mental thing as well that gets in the way. Banger every night. Pump banger every night. Yeah, let the fucking chips fall where they may. True. You know what you gotta do? Eat mixed nuts. Literally nuts make you nuts. Grow nuts. Yeah. I'm fucking Dr Rhonda. Patrick posted something on our twitter page the other day about it. She was like, just fucking nuts. Help help sperm production. Say it that way. She's like scientific. She's like, yo, bro, fucking nuts. You fucking just flow. You want juice, you got to eat a lot of nuts. But apparently if you eat a certain amount of grams of see if he could find the tweet. Certain a certain percentage helps you out. Certain like quantity of mixed nuts makes your balls grow, literally makes your sperm increase.

Speaker 2:          00:35:51       What makes your ball shrink? There's got to be a food that does the opposite of steroids. Yeah. I stopped eating those, uh, years ago. It makes your uh, your balls shrink because your balls aren't making any testosterone anymore. But my, I asked the doctor and he said that it doesn't, it doesn't reduce the amount of semen you produce. It makes your physical nuts smaller. Does your doctor son? He said you can. Yeah, because I asked him about a different doctor. Yeah, I met him at trader Joe's parking lot. He was a good doctor. He had like one of those little stands. This is why you're nuts or swallow. He made me show. I showed him my nuts. He maybe I let him hold him. He had to inspect them. Are put gloves on. She put the. Put them in my mouth and I'll tell you what. What's wrong

Speaker 7:          00:36:34       mom?

Speaker 2:          00:36:34       Do you have a girl that put. Put your nuts in her mouth in the and home. Look, a monk makes your brain. She put my nuts like a wildebeest.

Speaker 8:          00:36:47       Oh. Oh, nutmeg.

Speaker 2:          00:36:53       It will make you feel weird because it's such a deep sound. You'd be like, why am I coming to this deep sound? No. Then he'd get an imprint like deep sound coming noises like baby. Then it's Pamela noise for me. Deeper, deeper, deeper, deeper, deeper. Once you make a deal, what the fuck do you mean? Like I dude sound like a dude like a dog. And you shoot the hardest loads, man. That supplemented their diet with 60 grams of mixed nuts daily for 14 weeks, increased their sperm count by 16 percent of the shit sperm vitality by four percent and sperm motility by six percent according to a randomized controlled trial. This controlled trial was. My husband does a cup and dudes just into it every day for 14 weeks. What you got going on this week, man, badge isn't into cup with mixed. I mean mixed nuts and shit tight you get.

Speaker 2:          00:37:55       Instead, let's make a deal with this guy in this study. Like you can't come at all except for the study in the cup or otherwise we're not going to know because if you're banging all day one day and the next day you don't do anything. You're tired. Come Sad. Lazy Cup comes, comes out different. I don't know if anybody knows, but you ever take a few days off, beaten off. Hey and then you beat off and it's like, Hey, put a hole in the ceiling. It's flying all over the place. If I'm jerking off too much and it just kind of dribbles out, you feel like I'll lose or hey, I feel very depressed if my com volumes low. Like if I beat off and it's just like think she said why did I do? Why? Why? Why? I find it always depends on how much I build up. If I'm building up to it, I get a big one.

Speaker 2:          00:38:43       Build A. Oh, you edge fucking pervert. I didn't know about etching. It's fucking awesome. Norton had. Tell me about it. Does he edges he edge with prostitutes? He'd get a prostitute and you'd get right to the porn and come and go. All right, thanks for call another one next. Yeah. Why not get another prostitute? When was this? How long ago? Like yesterday. Now. When was this one? Was the prostitutes? Oh, Norton's. Still similar. Yeah, still. Yeah. Darden's an animal bro. That doesn't give a fuck. He does give a fuck, but he doesn't give a fuck at the same time. Like secretly. Secretly when they leave. Yeah, he's been the fuck out. Yeah. He gets disgusted with themselves, but that's what he enjoys. I feel like he should be free. You know the, the, there's like a, there's some guy I was reading something. Some guy was doing something on anti shame things as a doctor.

Speaker 2:          00:39:30       Like fuck. Shame was like is his thing. But that shame is a weird thing. Like there's things that people are ashamed of that we're not ashamed of. It all like sex, like it, like normal sex, like say if your wife's walking around the house at a pair of shorts and you grab her ass and she, you know, and she turns around, she smiles at you and the two of you start banging. That's fine. Yes. No. Are you married? You're going to love each other. You've, you're attracted to each other. It's all normal. Right? But if you lived in like a crazy religious household where she supposed to be dressed like a fucking table cloth, that would be a real problem. He would, she would feel awful. She would feel ashamed. So it's like what causes shame? Cultural acceptance. Right. And well, and the building blocks of how your race, right?

Speaker 2:          00:40:15       Like some people get shamed for from their parents for stuff that's they shouldn't feel ashamed about. Oh yeah, for sure. Yeah. And for Norton. So he pays these nice ladies to touch his penis and that's why they don't have to work at Denny's. But they still do. Yeah. That's their shifting their break. They go on a smoke break and go to edge him for an hour and a half dishwasher. Hands Kinda like real rink, like really, really strong fingerprints, you know what I mean? Fucking indentation on his really strong, like the, you know, the lines and the fingerprints that deeper than normal. The grooved all chemicals. Dishwasher, washing all day. What did, what does he tell you or cost of? How much money do you spend on hookers? I'm, well, I don't know. He's never really. He's a wealthy guy, so it's not a problem. That's the. That's part of the problem. Part of the problem is that it's not a problem. He's so successful. You know, Jim sells out comedy shows everywhere. He's got a Sirius xm show. He's written books. He's got plenty of money for hookers. So he's like, fuck it here. He's like the most free guy that I know. In terms of like talking about his weirdness and his perversion. Is he sober? Yes, he has been since he was like really young. Yeah, yeah, yeah. He had a problem and he got sober I think when he was 19. Holy Shit. He's been sober the entire time.

Speaker 1:          00:41:34       That's fucking mile. Yeah. Everyone's got advice. Yeah. Well his vices. It's a strong one, but it's like trannies. He's really into trannies for real. Yeah. Yeah. Good for him. Whatever. Whatever the fuck. He says it like you're not supposed to say it anymore. Like I just, I guess just got in trouble. Oh Dude. I got fucking lit up for that online. I, I didn't, I, I was with gay friends at a. What I put online, having the most fun at a Mexican, 20 bucks. People leave me the fuck up that it's not, that's not a word. We. I was like, okay. I was with gay dudes that they joked about it with me. I thought it was okay. It's a, you can say transvestite. You can't say tranny. Justin Martin. Dale can say whatever he wants. He does. He can. Yeah. Yeah, he does. He says whatever the fuck he wants because he's a flamboyant gay guy.

Speaker 1:          00:42:23       Yeah. He can get away with it. He does. He gets away with. He says fucking every. Yeah, but like a flamboyant gay guy could say that no one says shit, but a straight white guy from Chicago done you asshole. You piece of shit. Fucking ask Justin Mernda. He yells the n word all the time constantly. I didn't know that. No he doesn't, but I just wanted to put that up there. Tell him stop. No, I don't think you'd get that kind of freedom just by being gay, but if you were gay black guy. Yeah. Then you can't. Then you. I think you're good. A black transgender God could do whatever you want with no legs and one eye. He's disabled. Gay, black, trans. You know what's interesting? Nobody. I mean, no one accepts transracial can't do it. No one except transracial. That is the one thing that woman won.

Speaker 1:          00:43:08       Yeah. Rachel Doles out. Just that one line that we're not willing to cross no fucking way, which is meanwhile it is one of the most realistic lines. This is why totally human beings came from Africa. All of them will also. Race. Race has a lot to do with culture. Oh yeah, for sure. But I mean, literally all human beings came from Africa. That is the cradle of civilization. Yeah. So we're all African. So why can't you pretend to be African? Why can't, why can't you just be it? That's really what it is. His name pretending. If you just say, that's what I identify with. I get it. That to me is that, that's more on the other side of when people say like, you can't, you can't be a gender other than a male or a female. And people say yes you can. And that's accepted.

Speaker 1:          00:43:52       But if you said identify as Puerto Rican, they're like, no fucking way. Is there any race that would let you in? Like that is anyways? Uh, yeah. Come on. You could be a radiant. I feel like redheads or like the. I think I've got a little bit of a pass. He should have a pet. We have a passengers maligned. Yeah. We have a pass ginger's. Just kick a ginger dance. South Park. We're dead. We're, we're, we're, we're going to be gone in like 50 years. Everything a dying your hair now. I knew a dude who had red hair. He used to dies. Eyebrows. What a fucking Weirdo man. That's a weird fucking thing. Did hair dyed his eyebrows look different because he was that sad about having red hair when I was a kid. When I was a kid it bothered me like crazy and then I got and didn't give a fuck.

Speaker 1:          00:44:32       And then when you get older there are some women that like it that like that, that, that, that think that's a more attractive because it's real bad for them. Yeah, I think they're dumb fucking idiots. I know something went wrong. It's funny. Like what people, like some people like thick ankles. Oh yeah, girl. Gang. What's your weirdest specific thing that you. When you like when you first started getting into checks, when you find it figured out what your style was, what was the one thing you're like, that's weird and most people don't like that about girls. I don't have one. You don't have any of that shit? No. No. Like some guys love cellulite. You know? Some girls like, like, like, like Chunky bitches, Jamie over there.

Speaker 1:          00:45:11       He's like, Hey, don't talk. He'll put that evil on me. He's going to have so many dms from these bad chicks. It didn't bump. Yeah. You get your cellulite picks. Do you know that there's a new show on Netflix and they're trying to take off the air. It's about a girl who used to be fat and then she got skinny and she's getting revenge on everybody. That's fucking. What's that called? I want to watch. How would they take that off? That sounds even if you find it as some really pretty girl. She's going back to all the people that talk shit to her when she was young about being fast. I don't really pay attention to 100 percent, but uh, people were very angry about it. About the premise. Why fat shaming. Oh Gosh. Don't you know about fat shaming? What is it called? God. That girl Debbie Ryan fat phobic. Disney is. Oh, it's a fat foot. Hold on a second. Hold on. Let me read that.

Speaker 2:          00:46:00       Fat phobic Netflix series supports damaging stereotypes for young women. Well, listen, I'm going to tell you guys this really, really clearly. If your children are fat, they're eating too much sugar. Okay, so that's a fact. Fix that. Yeah. Or try but don't. Don't just call people fat phobic of your children. There's a lot of nonsense that's involved in people's bodies and education and the. The big one is what they eat has no bearing on what they look like. That is horseshit. Yeah, it's bullshit. You didn't have giant fat people in the twenties and you go back and look at fucking people in the twenties. They were all starving to death. They were all skinny and the bread they was, you know what someone fucking told me, Jordan Peterson told me this. We got to look up. Look this up. I'm emulsifiers. I'm also fires. And he was reading something about a most of fires that are used in fast rising yeast and in a lot of bread products are responsible for leaky gut and they have an impact on people's, uh, sensitivities to gluten. And he was saying that like emulsifiers or basically like fucking shampoo, you know, you have oil in the water of your, you know, your wash some dishes and all that greasy oil and you pour some dishwashing soap in there and the water he goes, that's in food. Like that's a similar quality

Speaker 1:          00:47:24       and that's a cost. That's what's causing all these like a gluten allergies and just a bunch of different that are causing it. One

Speaker 2:          00:47:30       of them is the more complex glutens because it used to be that you would get like a, like if you had wheat you would have, it's like old wheat was like a small little sort of grain. It was a smaller plant and then they, they started changing it and as they started changing and selectively breeding it, what they started doing it as making it thicker and more dense and, and that way you get a much higher yield per acre. But in doing so they also made it more difficult for your body to process. Yeah. So, but he was saying that it's also the uses fast rising yeast and that there's emulsifiers in it. And then I'm also, fires are apparently terrible for your body, which makes sense because you go to fucking Italy and I know you like to go to Italy and you eat some of that funk and pasta over there. It doesn't make you feel the same.

Speaker 1:          00:48:17       No, it doesn't. No. You actually don't feel as thick. I feel like you. I feel way thicker when I feel dumpy when I eat it back home. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:48:24       positive that I can buy online. That's from Italy. Fresh made pasta from there and what's not fresh made, but it's using it. It tastes

Speaker 1:          00:48:31       better if you feel better when you need it. Now you do. Actually. I know that sounds like a thing and an American traveler would say it's better over there, but it's. But it is true. You know, you go over there, they're not fat. It's us. If there there's someone fat, it's an American. That's what. Every time I see a fat burners have a thousand bucks and they're from the state.

Speaker 2:          00:48:48       They've got Tiramisu, they've got spaghetti,

Speaker 1:          00:48:50       good dessert, and have coffee every fucking night. Why aren't they fat and live for. They live their lifestyle. And their food choices, fat, fat phobic. I'm going to, I'm going to purposely have two kids and I'm going to feed one of them very healthy food. And the other one I'm just going to have sugary diet and just fat in the fuck out of them just to show society what's up. Dress them on to seal. And Paul had a boat and I'm going to have a rope. You don't have a rope through the premise of the show. Know like the plot I guess would be one of the fat show used to be fat. And then she lost weight. She got punched in the face.

Speaker 1:          00:49:33       Oh my God. That is so fucked up. That's fucked up. Wait a minute. Who punched her in the face? Her Dad's eating cake. Stop eating cake. You fucking cunt. It worked. Watch stupid. That's just stupid premise. And then. But she's getting revenge on people that talk shit. That's it, right? She's going back for vengeance on the people who hurt her. So the idea is that girls are going to watch that and they're gonna want to get their jaw wired shut. They're gonna tell their friends to punch them, break their fucking hit me with a bat, right in my head. I'm going to jump off my roof. There'll be a kyle dunnigan sketch that would be a great dentist that had hit me, hit me in the face while weight got my fucking God summer body. But people do lose weight when they get the award.

Speaker 2:          00:50:31       Oh No, no. Thanks dude. Fuck that shit. It's weird how vulnerable your jaws feel. That gold coast side of Saudi jaw. Yeah. It breaks so easy. Uh, so vulnerable. I can't be more. People don't crack their fucking jaw. When I was fighting, I was always. My jaw was always sore. Like you always get dinged. Like you'd always get. Inspiring. So like you'd be chewing and eating like this, like Oh, it's painful. Jaw was always sore. You feel it in your teeth. Do you feel it? And you're like where the joint is? You gotta realize your jaw is in many ways. Like your knee. Yeah. Right. Like you know your knee, your knee gets sore, like Ah. It hurts when you do that. When you get punched a bunch, your jaw gets sore. Like when you're chewing it hurts. What is that the worst? Or is like rib, rib content read punching worse.

Speaker 2:          00:51:20       The worst is your head always by far by far because it's scary and your ribs aren't scary. It's like I've had broken ribs, like one of my ribs, like on this side like sticks out more because it's been cracked and it's all fucked up. I probably broke at least three ribs, maybe more. I think I broke. I probably broke at least three. I don't know. I've, I've, I've definitely had some tears in the cartilage in between the ribs to promise. They don't really do much about it. When you get a broken rib, they don't put you in a cast. You can't do shit. I don't really do much about it. You're just in fucking agony for awhile until it heals up. I never broke ribs. I don't know that. I don't know if that painful and rip suck. But you're still okay. When your head hurts, you're scared. Oh yeah. I've had three concussions. I fucking. How'd you get concussions? So all sports. One football to basketball, basketball,

Speaker 9:          00:52:07       basketball was bad. Basketball as twice the same way. Because you fall. Yeah. Bam. Got My legs taken out from under me. Both toes. Jesus Christ on my neck. I'll never forget my mom tells this story. I'll never forget my friend who's now passed away. Sadly, he, uh, he's gone. But he called my mom and was like, don't freak out, but don't freak out. The first words to apparent. Don't freak out. But Andrew's in the hospital and of course my mom

Speaker 2:          00:52:31       is it.

Speaker 9:          00:52:35       I got my fucking knees. I went up to get a rebound. And on my way down all I just remember seeing the ceiling. That's the last thing I remember. My legs were oof right out from under me and I hit my head so hard on the ground that I bounced up. Everyone playing was like standing around in shock and I was blacking in and out, but I was so. It was so strange because you don't really, you don't really know it right away. You're like, what's going? I'm good. I'm good. I'm good. I'm walking, I'm good, I'm good. And everybody's like, sit down. Are you okay? Like, are you fucking, you know, you hurt me. You could hear it from outside. And then I sat down, they had ems come and I remember like clear as day when the emt fucking grabbed my hand and he started to walk and I go, I'm going to follow this.

Speaker 9:          00:53:16       I'm going to fall down and pass out. I said, I don't feel good. I'm not going to go to a black. And I remember I threw up. I barfed everywhere all over this. I puked and then I woke up again in the hospital. That was bad. That was the worst one I ever had. I had bruised a bruise all these vertebrae and the doctor kept saying how was inches of pressure away from cracking from bringing my fucking neck because all of my weight went one way. That was bad. Football was bad. Football was helmet to helmet. Shit. That shit sucks. I was a kid. I was kicking the ball because our kicker was hurt and the kid over snapped and went right over my head. I went and grabbed me. Soon as I turned around, I got fucking locked and then a guy in the sideline goes, you got your bell wrong boy. I mean, I got, fuck it. I mean, everyone was okay.

Speaker 2:          00:53:59       They were loving it. Fucking smart. I got smoked. I look like a fucking rag.

Speaker 9:          00:54:05       Sure. It's. It's a weird thing when people cheer. When someone gets gravely injured. Oh yeah. People love it because it's because you [inaudible] the force of it is like, Oh shit. It looks incredible to see. Let me think about fights. Same thing. Yeah. I mean when someone gets head kick fucking insane, you can't believe you're watching it. That's why the human, the human emotion of like

Speaker 2:          00:54:27       it could be fucking dead soon. Like the most disturbing ones I ever saw was Francis and knocked out Alistair overeem with this fucking left hook uppercut combination. Sent his head like literally he was like looking at his asshole, snapped his head back so far it was fucking her. And he literally flatlined. Yeah. I just flatlined leg legs, spread out, toes curled one punch. And it was, it was so powerful and so horrific that I was like, yeah, you can't help but go, Oh God, yeah. And, but see, people are cheering for someone getting horribly injured.

Speaker 9:          00:55:07       Well, I had a moment at, at UFC two to five and that's what it was in Chicago. I had a moment where I'm sitting on the floor and I was looking around and Tony and I were um, you know, it was uh, it was, it was between fights and Tony and Tony goes, this fucking awesome man. And I go, it is. And as I'm looking around it like soaked for a second in me that I was like, this is so a hit like historic in nature of like people gathering to watch people fight. It was so like, it brought me to this weird place of like, isn't this insane to think that all these humans are just coming to watch these two athletes just grapple at one another? It was just, it was interesting because the other sporting events don't, don't hit, didn't hit me like that.

Speaker 9:          00:55:46       But when remember when you were a kid and the kids would decide we're going to fight, one wants to watch. Fuck. Everybody gathered around. Yeah. It was way more exciting than what was going on in the stupid classrooms. There was, there was little, there was a little area in, in my high school that people fought at this like little secret guard. It was like a place that you could get to, you know what I mean? And people love. They do. They set up fighting. Two dudes fought over this one girl. They were both fucking and, and she was there. That was, that was even more fucking brutal. The the kid that they thought was going to win, he was. He was. I mean he was just a tough kid, but he had. He had, it was the middle of winter. I'll, I'll never forget, and he had really bad acne and the other kid, every time landed a punch.

Speaker 1:          00:56:24       You would see the redness get worse in his acne, in the blood start coming out of his face, zit blood as rough as it was, the fight. It was zip blood. One blood, one fighting over a girl. Not only do you lose the girl, but you also get your ass kicked. He was, and she was there, which was even more fucking brash occurred. That's how girls are such assholes. She stood there and watched these two dickheads fight over her shit. Did she say, don't stop. Cut it out guys, please. Now she. No, she didn't say shit. She said and she knows she did the triangle. Yeah, she watched them do it and the whole fucking school watching and then somebody would probably wasn't that fight, but one fight. I remember somebody taped and tapes were getting passed around. Oh Jesus. But this is what's fucked about school.

Speaker 1:          00:57:13       The school rule things like athletes, we always had this uh, guilty by association shit, if you're there you get suspended even if you had nothing to do with it because athlete code of conduct. Wait a minute. So, so, so if I'm at a party and it gets busted up by the cops and I don't have alcohol or drugs on me or nothing, but I'm at that party and it gets back to the school and the coaches I get suspended from whatever. Oh. Speaking of which, Bursa me. This one, there's a code of conduct at Netflix. Yeah. In like an internal thing. I'm sorry, just for laughs rather. Oh Shit. Yeah. Just for. I'm going to send you this young Jamie a Netflix has a or why don't we keep saying Netflix just laughs Montreal. Yeah. Has a code of conduct that they posted everywhere, I'm sure.

Speaker 1:          00:57:58       Oh yeah, yeah, of course. Yeah. Yeah. Hold on one second. For artists or for people. It's got to be for artists, for the comics here. That's so jamie. Yeah, a code of conduct, how to behave for comic, for adults grown people. Listen, you sell what fucked up people make? Yep. Okay. Yep. Okay. But we're going to take it as a code. Oh Shit. Can you make that bigger? In order to accomplish our purpose? The just for laughs festival must be exempt of abuse. Inappropriate or vexatious. I've never read that before. Have you ever heard that word before? To Vex two VEC, somebody vexatious behaviors. Everyone participating in the just for laughs festival must treat artists, festival goers and employees with equality, respect and dignity. No matter the gender, sexual identity, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, race or religion. I hope they love it. About out. Yeah. What about cognitive function? Right? It sounds like you can pick on really stupid people. Still JFL adopt a zero tolerance policy on harassment in all its forms. Whether it is verbal comments, actions, or gestures that are repeated, hostile, that, uh, affect a person's dignity or psychological or physical. Oh,

Speaker 2:          00:59:22       so you can't talk shit anymore. That's what we do. What we, what do we do? And we're hanging around. Fuck Shit. That's the whole thing. You've been harassing me. You've been vexatious with me, sir. Nothing in this policy should be interpreted as a barrier to artistic freedom too late, less heroin days. They got, they had to put a French word and that motherfucker. Discussion teams and security squads, what? Hold on. Intervention teams and security squads of specialized responders with the mission of increasing the safety of women and vulnerable persons during the outdoor events will be on street festival site every day between seven and 11, so if you want to molest, here's your hours after 11 up to seven, they'll be wearing pink armbands and luminous bracelets for v. better visibility in the dark. They will also have a tent located on a plus last bottom between bone mode, bumble news, God French's.

Speaker 2:          01:00:26       Awesome. What were the streets? We were. What were the streets? They're trying to remember if we can, we can molest on these streets boys, so it's branch out. We're going to go into the forest lesson on a road safety. Catherine, in addition, if you are the victim of a witness, a prohibited act. Okay, well, it's a prohibited act. Anything listed above. It seems like everything. Yeah, it is zero conduct. I mean them for no rape, no touching, no harassment model of that, but it seems like they're just covering their ass. Let's go back up to that. What you can't do. Again, I want to know what vexatious is. What's vexations? Inappropriate, abusive, inappropriate or vexatious behaved. That everything we do is inappropriate. Yeah. Okay. The idea of what we do for a living is inappropriate. That whole back alley where everybody goes and smokes. Yes.

Speaker 2:          01:01:13       An inappropriate zone. Every single time. It's. Every time you go back there, people would just say an annoyance, frustration or worry, Huh? Wow. Wow. Who was the thesaurus holder that pulled that fuck that bad boy out. Have you heard that word before? No, never heard that. We're covering up their. Their shit. This is them being so overly cautious because whatever insurance they've got on fucking whatever is like, you have to give fair warning that we have security for this, this and this. What's amazing is think about how long it's been going on where they didn't have that. Yeah. I was in just for laughs in [inaudible] 93. That your first. What was your first year and just for JFL? Nineteen 93 was your first year? Yeah, 93. Yeah. So how the fuck? Ninety three, but they're pulling this out now. That's crazy. Yeah, it's been around for forever, but I also love that it said on it that you shouldn't. You have to immediately email you. Imagine and we'll get back to you. You get molested, you go to email. Your Pussy still hurts. Someone grabbing it. You fucking assholes. I got email now. You know what? I'm going to fucking send this in. Yeah. You got an ice zero tolerance

Speaker 1:          01:02:20       at A. Hey, if you get physically abused, the email you have to email is. Ha Ha. You probably shouldn't put that email online. Gone. Sorry. Listen, what do you mean? That's, that's public. That's public. Don't get us wrong, but this is really public. No. Well, you know, you get what you get with it. Yes, but I mean, look, we're not pro harassment, don't get us wrong, but this just seems like a little over the top. But see this, this in some semblance of irony. This is harassing. It's just like poking the bear at people to be like, these are all the things you can't do. All it's doing is like steering people to go. I wasn't going to do any of that shit anyway. Why are you fucking. Why are you, why are you employing people to walk around and armbands to, to make sure I'm not doing a thing that I was never going to do?

Speaker 1:          01:03:11       Well, was it an issue? If it was a huge issue than that, then I'd like to know. Well drunk him comedians can be gross, so drunk and are pieces of shit. But you've created a festival where there's drunken animals walking the streets all night long. Right? So w w, I mean you need a shirt that says vexatious vexatious fixation vex me baby. If exit up, going it up and it up. I've been vexing all over him. All vexatious over here. I'm all inappropriate stuff being vexatious inappropriate to weird word too, because by WHO's definitions? But all that stuff is all subjective. Who standards of anything. It's to vex main means to annoy or to like poke and prod annoyances. Such a commonality in our fucking daily life. Yeah. I'm annoyed by that comment. Yeah. That's vexed. Vexed by the vexatious fucking the signed document. But what burst that all over?

Speaker 1:          01:04:03       He said it to me today. Yeah, I'm sure. I'm sure they posted them all over and people walking around trying to protect people who. What is that about? It's weird. It's like you want. You need fucked up people to make rock and roll and comedy and rap music. Yep. Like you need it, but in this day and age, nobody. Everybody wants no one to be fucked up. I think when people love, when people like reminisce about a time when a amazing artist who was a Weirdo, they do that because they don't. They didn't realize what also came along with it. You know, like they're like fucking, you know, whatever. An amazing musician. They were like, they were totally fucked up. They did crazy, fucked up shit all the time. It's like they couldn't do that today. Yeah. You mentioned Jim Morrison fucked be fine. You'd be fucked. He couldn't do any of the things he did. Fuck. They fucked. I mean that guy used to pull his dick out on stage. All the tested for it. Piss on. She piss on people. He pull out his dick and piss on someone and people think that like tea today. It'd be. That'd be the end of times for him. The end. That's all. I want to kill you.

Speaker 1:          01:05:08       Pissing off people on the front row. But that's the thing. It's like, that's, that's, that's the whole irony of this whole performers getting unbridled. I had a buddy of mine who loved music who's really into like old bands but did not like Jim Morrison. He's like, please anything, but why did he not like the doors? Because he was a good looking guy. I've got tons of pussy. It bothered him. I guarantee you that was part of it. I'm like, wait a minute. You don't think that Jim Morrison and the doors were good music? You don't think that break on through to the other side is a good song. Yeah. What do you look me in the eyes? You tell me. Break on through to the other side isn't a fucking amazing song and it was in 1968 or some shit. Yeah. Fuck you man. And he's like, that's just not. It's not good music, man. Yeah. I'm fucking Jim Morrison and the doors locked because he just slinging dick half out of it. It's so hot. So hot, so high. So gone. No shirt on. Still making phenomenal fucking music lunch out on like a scarecrow beads everywhere. Certified. Get this cocksucker candles, riders on the storm.

Speaker 1:          01:06:23       He made that intro so long so he could finish when he was getting blown up to this house. Come on, man. Break on through to the other side of the fucking amazing. So good. He had. They had so many amazing songs, but that era of music had so much good music. I think it was also another part of the problem was when Val kilmer played them, that was a big fucking issue. I mean, yeah, that was a big bummer for me. I'll kilmer who is a beautiful man at the time. He added all the beautiful men who are not beautiful men who fell so far. Woo, what happened? Val? Val just got into cake and heroin looks like pull up a picture, but it makes me sad every time I see it. Like I'm like, that guy was fucking bat. He was a batman. He was one of the best path man.

Speaker 1:          01:07:07       And now you're like, what did he do? Did you just start drinking booze? I don't quite remember what I remember. There was rumors about he had, he was like covering up papers, really sick. He had cancer, right? But then he denies it doesn't even deny it. I thought he denied it for years. I thought it was like a thing where people were like, he's, he that he said he was sick, but it wasn't cancer that he was like val cameras and comeback and the top guns sequel. Oh. So he got throat cancer. Oh man, he's, he's thin again. Yeah, he's looking better there. Let me see that. Don't scrawl. Stopped with the flashes. You assholes. Can't even see what it looks like. That's what it used to look like. The actor revealed the news on Reddit during an ask me anything. Q and a. Oh, how weird. Red, it's so funny, but that shit, one commenter said awhile ago, Michael Douglas claimed you have terminal cancer. What was the story behind that? And he said, killer responded. Okay. We can read that quicker. He was probably trying to help me because. Oh, what the fuck, what the fuck folks, because the screen got filled

Speaker 2:          01:08:16       with all of these popups for possibly new videos that you want to watch while you're watching a video. Uh, I did have a healing of cancer, but my tongue is still swollen, although healing all the time because I don't sound my normal self yet. People think I may still be under the weather. I like to refer to cancer as under the weather. That's a fucking, that's a pretty bold leap. But when he got really fat, but it's, that's one of the reasons why I got cancer, but he was really unhealthy because I think it wasn't just see what. I don't think it was just that he got cancer. I think he also was like really fucked up for awhile health wise in terms of he just looked so different. Bu's and chant. Yeah. Two Thousand 15. He was rushed to the hospital. Yeah, but this is before that, but see before 2015, he looks so strange there.

Speaker 2:          01:09:07       That doesn't look like the same guy. Well, it looks like he's got a Bandana. It looks and it looks like he's got to look at his left eye, but that's what. What, what does that say? Scroll up to what is his left eye looking at and as you're looking at someone choose. Someone's got a nice tip. Someone's got great shoes. Looking at one ticket. Left it. Geez, I'd love just that left head. Left to the juicy. I'm running errands and London without his trick. A tracheotomy. Trey. Trey, how do you say that? Tracheotomy. Craig asked me to. Oh, so he did. He had a whole. Yeah, that's why he's it out. Wow. But see, that's what I mean when they say rumors. Right. I do remember that he had denied it heavily that he had cancer. It was like a whole 2013. Oh, Michael Douglas for oral cancer.

Speaker 2:          01:09:54       Woo. Fuck me. I could douglas do them now. It wasn't that whole thing about him saying that he went down on his, on his wife too much, wasn't it like a big thing that he was like, he said that there was a rumor that he said find out what the story about that is. We should probably should clarify because I want to know what she got really mad at that apparently. I mean, yeah, because she's like, I don't got cancer pussy. Imagine your wise pussies. So funky. But people do get a lot of cancer from throat cancer, from HPV apparently. Well, that's real shit. Yeah. That's really from Lincoln.

Speaker 2:          01:10:32       Even, uh, even, even a lot of pussy venereal diseases are so weird because diseases that specifically come from sex. Michael Douglas. Sorry, I was sorry for the effect of oral sex cancer comments on my wife. Okay. What did he say though? Inside regretted the embarrassment caused to his wife Catherine Zeta Jones by the revelation two years ago that has cancer may have been caused by performing oral sex. Probably just joking. No, I don't think it was that his illness was a result of contracting the human papilloma virus, which experts believe can be brought on by Cunnilingus. I love that word. The store made headlines around the world when Douglas was promoting his emmy winning role in liberace bio pic behind the candelabra after being declared free of cancer. By the way, did you ever see that movie, Diaz and a fucking bit on that. That unfortunately has been lost because Joey Diaz has never really done a special other than he didn't one special couple of years back, but you to do a special on Joey Diaz, what you really do need to have joey do like five nights in a row and just turn the cameras on every night and just let them go loose and then fill it all and then eventually you'll get that Joey Diaz mom 100 percent.

Speaker 2:          01:11:48       Get that experience. But when you say, okay, Joey, be yourself now, get on camera and guys clap it in. It's just hard for a guy who's that wild and loose to be wild and loose on demand with a bunch of lighting on and they want to put makeup on him and everything becomes artificial and it ruins the vibe of what standup is. One hundred percent. So unfortunately, you know joey being the wild man that is. He's never a lot of his greatest bits are never been captured, but he had a Michael Douglas doing liberace bit. That was so good. It was so good because if you're watching that documentary, I watched it yet. We're not documentary movie drama. What is it? Bio Pick. What would you call it? Bio Pic. Yeah. It's so good. Yeah, it's phenomenal. You realize like, wow, crazy. Liberace was. He ended up like a pump for his dick couldn't get hard anymore.

Speaker 2:          01:12:39       She had like a little Dick was just always ready to rock and he's just banging his boy and his boyfriend was like, what is going on? Like, why don't you ever get solved? He's like, no, no, no, ain't no fucking explained to Canada with his Dick thing, thing, thing, thing, thing, thing. And you know, he would always do this thing where ladies would be like liberace. When are you gonna? Find a woman soon date that was really famous that they cut, that he dated someone super, super famous. Liberace. And who he dated. Like a really famous actress. There's a great song. Pull. Pull up the video for the song. When liberace winks at me. It is.

Speaker 2:          01:13:24       What will we get kicked off youtube for that one trouble before? Yeah. Yeah. Can we play it? And so we can hear it with the people at home can't. Unfortunately. Folks that you can look it up yourself. Well we can play. Would that, would the people on Youtube and not hear it? That's the problem yet. But Youtube, itunes would hear it, right? Or RSS feeds if you're android. Do you know this more android phones. There are phones. Yeah. Good fucking iphone. Shit. So annoying. Now it's annoying. I'm getting second. We're going Andrew. One too, man. I'm tired of the bullshit. Let's do it. Let's go together. Let's go. Every listener switch. Switch switches me. Crazy. Here it is. Let's listen to this song. So it's peggy king.

Speaker 1:          01:14:11       I found a brand new idol. He's charming as can be. This is a different world, a different world back then, man. Oh, get liberace. Hi. Like sucking Dick guy like that. I like to again, my bud. Uh, I started to shake. I started to shiver and every fiber in my being begins to quiver and she's smoking, right? Yeah. Yeah. Actually writing. I don't know. It's a pencil when liberace winks and queuing sent me. You hear the clink. When he winks clink,

Speaker 1:          01:14:49       I just tell people to go to it. Go to go to youtube. Google Peggy King. When liberace winks at me, it's a crazy video. I imagine he would like. He would sing that to him while he was pumping some dude. He was whatever. Visit boyfriend at that time when they have a. He winks at me. He didn't really. He Sang, but he was more known for playing the piano. But he was a singer too. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. But he was what? That song. He's not saying it at all. I don't know. He's winking when liberace winks at me. She was a huge star. Mass piano players. Fucking massive. Imagine if you were a kid today and you're like, I'm going to get famous. Playing the piano was like, fuck you and get the fuck out. Fuck you and fuck Kenny g, she's the last. Who's kidding? Geez.

Speaker 1:          01:15:34       The last guy to get famous for an instructor for one solo into one single. Instruments it fuck off. Well now because now you've got them. If you'd like playing the violin, you got also had like a hip hop beat to it or something like they have to do like a layer of something. No one does one thing and then that's it, but it's like, imagine if you're a kid today and you're like, I'm going to get famous riding the bike like Lance Armstrong, belkoff no. Chunk off. Get outta here. There's no no one now, no one liberace used. Judy Garland's West as Jesus Christ. Fucking popups today are so annoying. Mae West, Midwest West as least convincing beards ever. Yeah, right there. If you looked at them, they're looking at him right there. Make that picture bigger. He looks so good. I mean there's just people that look gay. Well, you know, here's the problem.

Speaker 1:          01:16:22       Those other guys would gay to. Well, they're all presented to people just look gay or back then he's on her left. Yes. That's him right there. Yeah, right there. Let me look at that smile. That's gay, but so's the guy on her right eye. Got Gaze is probably one of his buddies. Yeah. One of his roommates. Yeah. Midwest is like, I'm so confused. Nobody wants to affect me. It's just been typed in weight so we're liberace. Had no trouble getting all the dates he wanted and he gloried in escorting. Well known entertainers to parties. Getting his picture taken with Susan Hayward Stone. Rosemary Clooney? Yeah. May West was a pure garland. May West was the only one of his so called lady friends that I actually met as they say in Texas.

Speaker 2:          01:17:10       May was a hoot. Who wrote this? She was a drunk. Hmm. This is a gay website because what's up with that guy in the lower right hand corner from his boyfriend? Oh. Oh. The website's called Queer Queer. Queer. That's the name of the website. Jamie's this on a favorites. He's got that Shit bookmarked, so we'll get. Look that fucking Michael Douglas playing them. Look how good that is. Look, he looked exactly like him behind the candelabra. Well, they'll you that. Scroll down where they go side by side. Look at that one right there in the red with the Red Hue. Yeah. Look at that. Well, didn't they put makeup on him and shit and make them look more likely. I know what it still does. Structurally. Still kind of looks at. He has the same kind of close enough. Yeah. But I think they did something with his chin.

Speaker 2:          01:17:54       Chin. The lower the upper right hand one. Where the, the, the upper right hand. Upper right hand or lumps. Lumpski. I'm sorry. Upper lefthand. The one with the uh, the guy that actually got the work done. Yeah. Look, he, he made him get plate fat. Facial plastic surgery. So he resembled liberace. So he gets his face looked like liberace. His boyfriend, he wanted him to look like himself. And he made his boyfriend looked like him. How crazy is that? Yeah. Because liberace had a wig. So. And part of the movie liberace takes the wig off. Rob Lowe, Rob Lowe was amazing in that movie. That's a great book. What years that movie from. I was just gonna say it's not too long ago, dude. Let me tell you something. Joey Diaz had one of the best bits of all time about that movie. I'd like to get jude.

Speaker 2:          01:18:44       Joey d is high and make them watch it again. He should read. He should read birth. That video. I want to know this bit. So fucking it was so committed to beg them to do it, but he won't do it. Good. Don't do that shit anymore. The problem is you would have to. He would have to want to do it. You really couldn't talk him into doing it and he would also have to be enthusiastic about it again, like why he'd want to want. He'd want to tell a half to want to tell the joke. Yeah. What was the whole bit? So it was. The story was he was watching the you drama. He can't eat pussy with asthma behind the candelabra by joy. Is this it? I don't know. It's a 10 minute rant about it came from his podcast. Jesus play this. I didn't even know this existed. Look at that. That should be a shirt. What was the last good movie?

Speaker 10:         01:19:30       The last good movie I seen the last one. He was with men on fire that said, why don't go to Mexico because Mexico. Have you made friends with Denzel Washington? Don't go to Mexico. You understand me if you don't about watch fucking man on fire. Play this. Who did this? And the second best movie. I've seen this movie on Hbo called behind the Candelabra, behind the candelabras. Liberace scoring. Some of you guys are very young. You don't remember liberace. There's a lot of people that are long in the tooth. You know what the fuck? Liberace. Liberace was a piano player from the sixties or seventies that was very popular. He was flaming and he had a fucking wig, but he, he, he pulled a Michael Jackson. He told people he was engaged, so nobody really believed that he was gay. I don't give a fuck either way if you're gay and that I. It makes no difference to me. He was a good piano player. They did this movie about them and the funny thing about this movie that he was played by Gecko, Michael Douglas Played Liberace, so we came home one day and I'm like, fuck it, let's watch this thing. Right? So I'm watching this liberace dude, and he's playing the piano and shit and whatnot. When you watched a movie, you're like, look at this fucking old guy. He's got game old guys. Got Damn okay. A lot of people don't realize. It's like the DOS equis fucking guy.

Speaker 10:         01:20:48       You ever see him hanging out with Betty White and a bunch of old hags do you know? He's hanging out with 19 year old chants at the mall and there's always like two of them, but there's always a third one that comes and she's like, why are you hanging out with this creepy guy? He's old little girls like he's not creepy. He's just lonely. His wife died. He just wants to conversation. He doesn't want none from us. He's like your grandpa and all of a sudden there's that one girl that goes, grandpa, he fucking around with these old guys. You will suck one of their fucking dicks because patient, they're very patient and like young guys go right for you. A little vagina on old guy throws you in a web and they play you like they fucking call on you. You ladies have been taken by an old guy at one point your fucking life. They rock your world and they'll fuck your brains out. You catch them with some good old blood transfusion or they been eating that shit.

Speaker 10:         01:21:49       I had a friend who was a stripper that said she went home with a 50 year old guy one night. She didn't walk for three fucking days. I'd go again. That's not me. I come in a minute and a half, but it's not me at all. I'm just talking about that. There's guys out there that will rock your fucking world and liberace was probably one of them. The other guy that played, the guy that fell in love with him was played by Matt Damon. Now I love Matt Damon. I'm watching this and I'm like, this is going to be fucked up. Matt Damon plays a confused kid that he's bisexual and one night he goes to see liberace play the fucking piano at EDC, gets impressed by liberace. He goes, oh my God, look at the way he's moving his head that an afterward he sneaks into vip, at least sneaks in with this little blonde hair. He looks beautiful. Matt Damon, he's all yoked up and shit and liberace. He's got his robe on with his sandals and he looks and he sees Matt Damon and you could see he loses his fucking mind. He's just looking at them with that gay. Looked to him like, I'm going to fucking kill this pork chop when I get my hand.

Speaker 4:          01:22:51       No,

Speaker 10:         01:22:54       Matt Damon sees this. Andrew Santina was a dig and he's looking at me. He walks over to him. He goes, oh my God, Linda playing something. He started texting people or I was taking selfies. I'm pushing the show. Oh you,

Speaker 9:          01:23:06       thank you. When I was a kid and I can't shut it off, I'll go, we'll go listen to the bit folks to run the candelabra. The problem with like planning a bit, everybody stops and then you pull your phone out while I was checking to see about the shit to be there for it there and forgot to put it back up. So that was on youtube. Either half of it was. Oh well that's a problem. I'll fix the board just for a second day. The fuck are you listening to you just stand there staring. We're watching Santina play with his phone. You're, you're one of those no cases on your phone. Fuck that. What's the difference in risk taking move. But. But what, what? What's gonna Happen? That's gonna break. But then I get a new one. So first world, but the apple care shit.

Speaker 9:          01:23:44       It's 90 bucks and you get a new one. But do you want it to get a new one? Don't you want to just protect your phone so you have to go to the fucking apple store when you drop your phone. Here's my argument. You have an argument for that here? Yeah, because everyone says it's white. Look. Okay. This is why I liked the sleekness. The design, the feel is beautiful. Then we put cases on them and fuck them up. They brag about how thin and one of them they are. Then you shove a fucking case on it. It loses all the beauty and the architecture of why I like the from Steve Jobs was in love with the idea of like the design of the phone and that's what apple's whole stance used to be. Sleekness design could thin like everything about it was how sexy it was and then we're like, yeah, put a fucking case on it.

Speaker 9:          01:24:20       So it never breaks. Still succeed with this case. No chunky. This sounds classist, but like I have enough money. You obviously way more than me, but like you can afford to break it, so I just don't care if I. most Americans that like breaking a phone is a big deal. I get it. I can afford to buy a new phone. I don't care. I know you're so first world. Yeah, but that's fucking honest. That's like saying, you know, I get it dude. Some people treat shit. Some people treat it like it's also everyone will go. Knock on wood, I've never broken a phone. I've never had a case watts. This is my fifth iphone. Come on. You never broken A. I swear on my fucking mother's life. I've never shattered a phone in my life. Never once. I've never had a case. You Ever Shit your pants twice?

Speaker 9:          01:25:04       Once, once in Japan. Once here ever. I Shit my pants. Ever once in Japan. Once, here, here. Not here, here and right here in the studio. I'm shitting my pants. I Shit my pants in Japan. That's a real fucking story. Yeah. What happened? We, we, we went out the night before. I had the most fun I've ever had in my entire life and my stomach was not having a good time with whatever we ate for breakfast and I was walking the street. We were going to a temple and I and I had, I just had a little, a little far came out and I and I stopped and I thought, no, no way. No Way. Really. I couldn't. Like, I couldn't comprehend it. Actually it happened. I had to go to like a little seven, 11 type place and in this little tiny room, take off my pants, take off my shit, underwear leaving in the fucking in the bathroom and then and then go wrong.

Speaker 9:          01:25:51       Even shit underwear and bathrooms brewed move. And now I know those people have to go in there and smell that underwear. I just posted in the trashcan and I covered up as much as I could. You coming up the smell? Shit. The trashcan out. Why don't you throw it in the garbage can outside. Carried out. Carried out two fingers. My poop. When my shit. My Shit underwear. Yeah. No, just go like this. No, no. I had shit. I had to throw it right in the trash can and disappear. That's kind of like. Yeah, but that's not okay. Okay. This isn't that uncommon like in a lot of places around the world. You can't throw toilet paper in the toilet. You have to put it in the trash can. What? Yeah. Fuck. Yeah. Yeah. You go to central and South America. You can't. They don't. They say please no toilet paper. So people shit in the toilet and then they throw the fuck. They're asked wipes in the trash. Jamie say, alright, I'm not playing. You've never been to a country like that.

Speaker 2:          01:26:47       Maybe I didn't read their sign because they don't because the pipes are old. They can't handle all that. People pay. Fix your pipes. You fucking cave people. Fucking cave. Monks get pvc. Cheap. Fuck Dude. In Thailand, every bathroom that I went to right next to the toilet has a goddamn garden hose. Like you would use to wash your car on your ass. Yeah, like nothing. Not a gentle, but day like we have those toilets. Those. What do they bond Dell's. Those are so dope. Yeah, they're amazing. Yeah. The seats warm. When you sit down, you press the button, a gentle warm jet of air hits your butt hole and like, oh, that's so nice. Yeah. This wasn't like that at all. This was a Goddamn like you'd clean an elephant with a green. Whoa. A garden hose. No. It's like one of those guns. You know, you, you have a lot of pressure on it.

Speaker 2:          01:27:38       That's what it was. You can't flush the toilet paper down the loo and these European countries. You go my friend or look at all these different ones. Bulgaria, Turkey, Greece, Turkey, Greece, Macedonia. You can't flush toilet paper. You can. It'll fucking break a pipe though. What kind of thin walled pipes they have over there? That toilet paper's breaking big. No, that doesn't make any sense. The mass amount, it clogs up. The pipes are too many people. Shit. No one seems so crazy. Like what? Have you have a lot of fiber in your pool? Like what if you're eating a lot of Broccoli and you have like elephant type who? Riley in rock shit. Another thing in Thailand, they sell poop paper. They sell paper that they make out of elephant shit. Yeah, because elephant shit is all fiber. So what they do is they take that elephant shit.

Speaker 2:          01:28:26       They wash out the fecal bacteria and they use the actual plant fiber material. They turned that into the toilet paper and you. It's a novelty. You wipe your ass with elephant shit. So you wipe your shit with Shit. You're wiping horseshit. Yeah. How does it. It can't smell good even if they've done by the smell and it. Bro. What is this poop paper park? Yeah, that's it. Elephant who? Paper poop paper. The poop poop poop. Yeah. Paypal. They take it and they break it down. Building a future in which humans live in harmony with nature. Okay. And they sell this stuff and wipe your butt

Speaker 11:         01:29:06       Uh,

Speaker 1:          01:29:11       it's like when someone has a clever family reunion shirt and it's just like, okay, I got it. Fuck it. You know what? I'm sick and fucking tired of who by the way, people that make shitty slide jokes. I think they're funny flight attendants now that are trying to make her like funny little jokes that that's like a culture now. Do you know what I'm talking about on the fucking Internet started it. Yeah. But a lot of other airlines are doing because they think it's cute, like southwest does it all the time because their trash, they don't give a fuck fucking trash cans and this guy, but no seriously unlike maybe delta, but like they make little cute jokes. Like if you don't know what we have to drink, maybe you've never flown before because it's been the same thing for 20 years and then a few people like few idiots on the plane that you're.

Speaker 1:          01:29:50       Don't make jokes. Did fucking this isn't the time. Just tell me that bullshit and go sit the fuck down and shut up. Dude. I don't like the jokes. This is coming from a guy who makes jokes for a living for money. That's not their job. Their job is to make sure I get my fucking sprite. Let them in my peanuts. A little rush. Fuck them, Jo. I don't like them. I don't like them. Do you remember the first thing that you ever did in front of a group of people that got a laugh? Like a little inappropriate laugh? Yeah. My Buddy's sleepover type of shit. Yeah. Little thrill that you get with that. Inappropriate. Yeah, but it's not my job. Their job is to be the flight of 10. I don't need the job from the flight attendant. She's so rude. Fuck them. He was so mean.

Speaker 1:          01:30:25       They're fucking mean. Use their man. They're fucking mean. Most of them are assholes. One Lady told me that I had to put my fanny pack in the overhead compartment, fine, shake it off and how to use it as a bag. I a stored as a bag. I'm like, why should I go? What if I take everything out of the bag and put it in my pockets you could do, and then she couldn't say. She just take the bag off. I'm like, this is a power move. No one's ever told me that before. One Lady told me to take the fanny pack off. I think she was just anti fanny pack, but you don't see. But you know this and Americans that have experienced that know when you fly in business or first they treat you like a fucking king and when you fly in the bud of the plane, they don't give a fuck about true.

Speaker 1:          01:31:03       This was in first class? Yeah, but she was doing that because she's fed up with whatever her day was, but most time they let you get away with anything. I think she was Chubby and she wasn't getting Dick and that fancy. I felt at the time to fanny packs, you get snack and I just asked you a question, are you chubby and do not get any dick? Is that why you're doing this? Imagine if you said that. I just need to know before I put my fanny pack away just because of a lack of Dick. It'd be great if she goes, you know what? Yes. And then just walked away. You want to give me some deck you can wear the fact that you fucked me with just the fatty package. Back Click taking it off overhead apartment. It is. I'll be right back with liberace winks sent me today.

Speaker 1:          01:31:45       I can't wait till everyone at home has that stuck in their fucking heads. I started to shake. I was articulate the things that people thought were entertaining and like the fifties, it's so strange. You go back now and watch that stuff, but that was like a. That was almost like sultry to back. Then you know that she's like with our pen, like this innocent girl writing note. What the fuck was she even writing down? And then she's, she's gone. Oh, just when the piano man winks at me, like that's the naughtiest shit of the day. If I had a time machine, what I would love to do is take like all these old folks that are like in, in the audience watching that weren't even old folks at the time. Right. Young people like in their thirties thought that was wonderful and put on like a modern day mumble rapper.

Speaker 1:          01:32:33       Have 20 people on stage with them, puff and blow, you know, freaking fucking lean and trap, trap, trap music and just give it a hobby. The booze were already did the, about who these people. Just like, like the kid with the hair, the rainbow hair kid. What's his fucking name? Is he a mumble rapper guy got beat up in New York. He got pistol whipped right? Allegedly. You never know when a guy like that you made it up himself was just gonna say that's a great promo. Yeah. He might have punched himself in the head because I saw a photo online. It didn't look like he got. Why can't I think of his name? A friend of mine was breaking up with her husband at the time and they were screaming and yell at each other and dude starts clawing at himself, start to scratch marks on him saying that she was attacking him, ripped his clothes. He called the police, a guy did it.

Speaker 1:          01:33:24       Listen, it's not outside the realm of possibility. A mumble rapper took that fucking dunked himself at the head, the security to call, call the ambulance right away when in this day and age, people are just doing anything to stay relevant, to stay relevant, to get attention. They'll do anything. Well, that's what the. That's what instagram has become. That's what the Internet has become. It's just become the way to be like what it's become, but it's certainly a venue for people that don't have any other options. It's big. It works. A lot of people make, make actual careers on just on Instagram, but there's people that like Kendrick Lamar is not doing that. Yeah, he's. Yeah, but what I'm saying, he doesn't need that shit where he doesn't need that shit, but some people do need that shit. Then they're tattooing their face and mumble rap and pistol whipping themselves.

Speaker 1:          01:41:08       What's the benefit of compression socks? It's the same thing as compression sleeves. It's exact same thing. She keep the muscles warm. Was that war? That would. It does. Athletes. Certain athletes claim that it helps keep their muscles in between place. See I've where rash guards for Jujitsu. Functional, but it's compressed. It's like, you know, it's compression. It's like it's tight. It's the main functionalities not to get your skin super fucked up right now. There's this for, for to keep the muscle tightened warm. That's weird. That's fucking weird man. Like it's marketing, but I don't know the science behind it. Fucking weird. I mean, listen, there's. I mean there's something to be said about keeping muscles warm when you're working out, when muscles get cold, but is that what it does? Lets lets google. What are the benefits of compression clothes for athletics? There's going to be some, some compression.

Speaker 1:          01:41:59       A salesman that fucking hit us up and just give rights to nine. Our paragraph. I started to shake for compression socks, ties quick, properly designed and fitted compression like we're prevent venous blood pooling in the legs and improve leg symptoms and decrease the risk of blood clots. Yeah, but there's so much blood flow when you're working out. I, I highly doubt there's a lot of pooling and athletes. One of the things that I saw when I was in Thailand where they had stores, stores, stores, stores that were was all compression clothing including face masks and gloves. It's just a. that's just like a leather daddy suit with that was like. It was tan skin card. It was fucking strange, man. Weird. We're outside the store. I was like, what is this? What is this? Oppression shops through. They had it for little kids. No little masks.

Speaker 1:          01:42:49       A little kid. Now you're getting into a weird territory, little pants, little masks, little shirts. It was real strange shit. That shit is gross. Then you get into a territory of something pervy. I think it's people that eat too many noodles. You just eat all those carbs. He's just fed down. See, I know people that travel. My Dad used to work with this guy and he would travel a lot and he always wore compression. He was a bigger dude. He wore compression sleeves and socks and stuff on planes because traveling a lot. That's why that piece. Some people like it for that. I think some people use compression socks when they travel up there on planes all the time because you do pool and clot on planes. Yeah. It happens to people all the time. You Pool and clot blood can pool on planes very easily.

Speaker 1:          01:43:24       Don't you need to just go to the gym? You Lazy. Fuck fact. God damn fact fucking compression shorts. It's not going to fix it. That's just wrong with your body, bro. It's pooled and pooling. They could. You just sunk in the seat. You're gelatinous membrane. Would you like it? If they, if they, if they had an airline that you could work out on the fly and play a pay a premium and had a gym in the back of the plane, like on a commercial jet, dickheads doing cleans and he drops the bar and it goes right through the be fucking hilarious.

Speaker 2:          01:43:52       Kids start getting sucked through the list. All your own risk and you're in the middle of the perfect bit. You're writing and you're like, yes, I got it. You clap your hands together and you'd show your lab. Cop goes flying through the whole floor because some dickhead wants to do is cross fit workout on the crossfit gym in the sky. You couldn't, um, couldn't lift weights there, but maybe you can have machines. Yeah, that'd be a cool machine. You could do or presented those resistance bands. Machines. Those was like a cable cable machines, right? Those three 60 machines. What does this, Jamie. It's on its way. What's Santina knows ahead of the curve ahead of the modular modular planes. I think that they've sort of the fuck out of here in the flight exercise project. Hold on, let's go up. So we could read that inflight exercise.

Speaker 2:          01:44:38       Your next flight abroad could include a Jim. When's this article published? May, may pose an Airbus project. Is displaying a prototype flying jim module, the San Jose airport. The modules can be used for spas, napping pods or gaming center. That's tight trans. Stop, stop, stop scrolling. Transpose isn't the first to suggest using cabin space for activities that promote wellness. Although such ideas are intriguing. A lot of these concepts don't really account for the business model of air travel. Says Devin Lidl principle behind strategist of fatigue. Yet he's what's called the fund stopper. Devin, you fucking fuck head. What does that. Those are sleep. Oh, that's like a, um, like rubber bands. Like you do like yoga mats or something like that. That's Kinda cool man. See that seems reasonable, but I feel like so few people are going to use it that it's going to be one of those things where after awhile it's just like, hey, remember when we used to have a smoking port at the back of the plane? That's what's going to be like. Remember that used to have a fucking. Oh, so these are the napping pods. That shit's awesome. When we were flying to Thailand, there was this one dude that went to sleep immediately and he was an enormous guy. Andy, who's the loudest I've ever heard in your life.

Speaker 2:          01:46:01       Wake the fuck up. I go, no. Hey, hey, you're young. You're fucking. You're loud. I'll wait cheap. Allowed you wake them up. I do it. I've done it before. I'm playing with you. Say I go, excuse me, and they, you're, you're fucking, you're snoring. Just want to let you know you're snoring. And they give me. They give you like a fuck. You look, but it's fuck them. I don't want to sit there while the plane is quite here. You having fucking apnea. I don't need to hear it. Yeah, it was bad. Yeah, it's fucking gross. Went, went on for hours. See people covering their head with pillow. How long is that flight? Fifteen hours. Twelve hours. Thirteen hours to Taipei. Fuck. That shit was gray. Rome. Rome from here is 14. One fifth, something like that. Yeah. So no mother fucking listening to think about. Think about that. They put a gym on there for a premium. People might pay man for long flights and not in that, not

Speaker 1:          01:46:50       in the US, but overseas flights. People might be like, man, I can fucking get a workout in before I land. Take that snoring guy, bring them back there and goes, well, you're still on a machine. Yeah, you fat. Fuck you fucking heads to fat. That's the sign that says p, everyone pays fat. Fat, head, fun. Workout for free. I want to know like what? When did people start getting fat? Fat? Well, I'm, I mean, I mean that sugar documentary claims that it's in the revolution of corn syrups. Introduction into the fucking. I would like to know though, like when people, when the transition, what was a rare person like way back in the day they got that fat, like what do you think? Like the six sixties in the seventies, things started to change. I don't know. I imagine when our technology boom happened in the eighties as probably when it all started.

Speaker 1:          01:47:40       Well it happened before that for sure, but it was also like sugary cereals and stuff. Right? And doesn't that stuff introducing the eighties, seventies were like that. That was the end of like natural cereal? No, they had those sugary cereals in the seventies for sure because I was a little kid, a little kid in the seventies where they like they are today. Oh yeah. Cocoa puffs in like. But I mean the amount of hunger, I wonder what it is comparatively because. Because now it's like 40 grams of fucking cup. It's, it's absurd. I think it was the same. He do. But then do you think it's because they were using cane sugar then? In different times? I think people got fat even back then. But I think it's expanded. It's expanded to everything. Well, convenience to write those. You can get any fast food everywhere all the time.

Speaker 1:          01:48:19       Twenty four hours is brilliant. It doesn't. Mcdonald's really put sugar in their fries. Yeah, man. They put them in their fucking buns. They put in everything. Sugar's in everything and everything. They make their buttons. The buttons have sugar in them. They add sugar to the bottle. Yeah. Wow. Dextrose? It's dextrose. Sugar, sugar. Howard taft. The president was 340 pounds and that was a long time ago. Three 40. How tall was. He was trying to look up more information on that, but it was all come, just loved come. He just drank a gallon of come. I'm ready to address the state of the union, but first I need my kids, you know, task. There's a big juggernaut. That was this thing. My fellow Americans burp Kennedy. Same thing. Kennedy was a little, little, little teacups. Kennedy apparently was on all sorts of drugs, including crystal Meth, the meth them up.

Speaker 1:          01:49:16       He was a, he was in a meth. Yeah. Yeah. Kennedy apparently had some serious physical ailments and um, he was in dire straights. Is that true? He was a big pill head who's in massive pain. They said that in the, like, it's like if he didn't get assassinated, he would've never done two terms. He would have been dead just from whatever the fuck was going on was going on with them. Yeah. He had some serious back problems and so he was such a young fit guy. Like he didn't look, he didn't look. He looked in shape. Not really. He looked young, but compared to most presidents, anything. He looked in shape. Here's a picture of taft. Look at that fat. Fuck that Walrus. Looking at motherfucker. What year was this? Nineteen. He's got. He's got food in that hat. Maybe 19, 19, but I can't say.

Speaker 1:          01:50:06       Well, I bet it's booze, right? He was solid. Serious booze. That's so big. That's crazy. How big he was so easy. Our fattest president, who's our skinny as President Lincoln, that tall, skinny motherfucker. Lincoln's pretty God damn skinny. He was a rail wirey. How would that look? Three 40. That's what's funny. Those pictures make him look to $50. I was gonna show you this one. Photoshop, Photoshop, and in 1929. This is White House portrait. Oh yeah. They skinned him. Skinning him up for that. Yeah, they did the trim them up a little bit because it's a portrait. Because they made that chair look big. It was smart. Move on. The artists. Yeah. They shrunk them up a little bit there and make them look a little bit more regal. Like Obama may have been one of our skinny. He was skinny as shit. He was fit even though he smoked cigarettes.

Speaker 1:          01:50:57       George Bush, I guess was our most recent Bush was was not out of shape. He wasn't just a big. He wasn't a big guy. Reagan was thin for an old guy. He's saying he was like in the seventies, right? James Madison was five, four and 100 pounds. Damn. Not even a real guy for $100. That's not even a real guy. That's a fake number. What year was that? James Madison. Boy. That's tiny. Five for a 100 pound or pound grown man. What did he eat? Presidential term? 18. Oh, nine slash 18 slash 17 people back then. Didn't have any food. I think the average height person probably five, five, five, six. When they were always just dodge and Indians. If you were a smaller, the arrows that go over your head. If we didn't have to duck, you can just stand there.

Speaker 1:          01:51:50       Well, what do you think? That's not funny though. I bet you if you. If you had a sliding scale of the height of the presidents, but there was a thing about the civil war where they said that, uh, the average soldier in the civil war weighed 125 pounds because they were like 17, 16, 17 years since they were kids. Right. Most of the soldiers were like children. Yeah, I'm sure. Well, most of the soldiers today or young, same thing, we use 18 as a standard, but back in the day there wasn't a fucking number. Wow. Wonder what the number was? Google the average size of a soldier in the civil war. I'm pretty sure it was 125 pounds, you know, that I have are so tiny. I got a picture out there of Sinatra. His mugshot. You weighed 125 pounds. Yeah, he was. He was a skinny, tiny, tiny, tiny dude.

Speaker 1:          01:52:37       Five eight. One 43. The average. I look up the Ed. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I spoke to quick. This was a no. Yeah, civil war. An average civil war soldier was white, native born farmer, Protestants single between 18 and 29 and he stood about five, eight, 1:43. That's weird. One of the. It was smaller than that. That also sounds very under 43. Seems like a reasonable size for that time when there's no food, but you're also talking about it. There wasn't this like how could they have been that organized? I'm sure people were just fighting who were around. I'm sure people just join the ranks and they weren't like, you got to go through the process. They were like, here's a gun. Go fucking kill somebody. Do you think they didn't measure their size? I think they've. I think they took anything they could get.

Speaker 1:          01:53:17       I think they were like, fuck this. We need everyone we can get. Especially in the south, Metro, southwest, the southwest. Just all against be. Everybody wanted to join in the south and the north people were like, alright, I guess we'll fuck you guys up if we have two soldiers was 12 told you? Look at the little drummer boy, common age was 19. Holy Shit old. His age was 80. You imagine you're 80 and you're. You're in Gettysburg. What are you doing, man? Just go sit down fucking 80. You have to fight, man. You want to keep that stupid flag flying to the fact that they still bitch about it. Did you watch fucking Sasha Baron cones thing it. It's a holy shit of him getting this Georgia. This is Georgia state representative to be like fucking huck and the n word out like 10 times saying why did he say it?

Speaker 1:          01:54:07       What was the, cause you know it. Sasha. Sasha finagles him into doing these fake psa ads or whatever of like antiterrorism shit without be given. I don't want to give away Stacie's Oscars. One of the head writers over there, he was telling me he was, he was, he was. He says it gets crazier. Oh Dude. You could tell it that you could tell them just tipping you. They're like, man, here's a little something for you. It gets really crazy at the last episode from this. This care. The one character that's like, uh, the Israeli guy. Yeah. Too fucking good. As I care. It's great. Pull up a video of that character when he was talking the a second amendment guy like making like cute guns for kids. They do. They do ads for guns, but the character is so crazy. This is the most sugar is the Israeli commandment.

Speaker 1:          01:54:57       And tell the kid that have safety gun and it's got big, big plush doll on top. They put like little plush towels on kids, guns and shit. Pull his mouth. Eat, shoot gun. Apparently they like those really hardcore Christian Second Amendment cause they love Israelis of course. So they love Israeli soldiers. Man. This is why he decided to have. This is really character. This dude is hilarious. Gop lawmakers who enjoys giving, endorse, giving three-year-olds, guns, stuffed animal. The stuffed animals surrounds the gun. You're not gonna. See any day, but see if you can get a video of him doing the character. Yeah, see click. That's just going to be the full trailer. They won't show you, but play it. Play it, play it, play it. No, that's it. That's it. My next guest is a gun rights advocate and he the bushmaster semiology

Speaker 12:         01:55:44       rifle. The type of rifle Adam Lanza used to killed 20 children and six mile ride is quite a blast to shoot with tons of fun. Some of them are much more cool than others. Are you proud of what you said? It's just a fact. In America there have been a lot of shootings in the school and into university. What do the liberal say is the solution? Well, they blame it on guns because the guns. Yes, we've got sugar. It is. We started a program in Israel for kindle guardians. Okay. We train them from the age 16 down to the age three.

Speaker 13:         01:56:30       Yeah. Well I. I think it would be a good idea. We'd been pushing something along this line for years, but really haven't gotten any traction with it. We were thinking seventh or eighth grade. You're talking much younger than that.

Speaker 12:         01:56:43       My son was in the very first program. May he rest in peace night doing what I love.

Speaker 13:         01:56:52       Quite developed a conscious where you you feel guilty about doing something wrong that's developing that you're learning right and wrong. If they don't, haven't developed that yet. They could be very effective soldiers. This year in our state government, they had a bill put in that would have made it illegal for someone four years old to 12 years old and have access to a gun. Uh, we, we killed it. We killed the bill.

Speaker 12:         01:57:20       They tried to stop. Four year old children benefit from having access to guns. Yes. Yes. What is the logic that these people come up with? May just think that children can't handle them. We want players who are really experts at what they doing not play. Also a checklist and we don't teach toilets because they call it the terrible twos for me. Do Instructional video to show you? Yeah,

Speaker 9:          01:57:50       well you should folks watch that. But what's really crazy is the makeup man. Let's look at the makeup that he's wearing. He does one where he's like a, an NPR type of cat and he goes to Kingman, Arizona and he tries to build a mosque and they, the initiative that comes out of their mouth off on it. The one dude goes, there's blacks in this town and we don't. They don't belong here either. And the guys. And of course he's, he makes a joke and then he goes, no, what I'm telling you is we tolerate them. We tolerate the blacks. It like sit and it sits in the room for a second. You're like, good fucking God. These are real people that exist there exist. Take tolerate the blacks. Great. Great name of his show too. This is America. Yeah, this is it. This is the guy from new mosque per gigabit, Mpr guy with the wooden beads around his neck. He nailed it. His intro was hilarious because he goes, I'm a self hating white man plays at play that video. Try to find that video. It's really fucking funny. And then you. And he's a genius. He, he, uh, he lays us. What is this, this, this, this

Speaker 12:         01:58:54       huge economic growth here. Wants to see an investment of $385,000,000. Guess what? You guys are going to get it here to tell you chosen as the location of a brand. You state of the art mosque. I know some of you are thinking, okay, this is just another typical mosque. This guys is going to be the world's largest mosque outside of the Middle East.

Speaker 9:          01:59:48       The word alone scares you, Jimmy. When I hear the word mosque, I think of terrorism. This guy, is there a need for this and kingman? Yes, there is. Your town will become for the whole thing for tourism, but the character, the character is this guy right there. That guy that. The toothless dude that was just on him too, but the other dude, he's the one that's like the fucking blacks we tolerate. It's a. We have to. We do it because we have to look at his shoes. Ready fucking outfit. This is amazing. Every detail of every character he does the clothing is is some of the funniest shit. It's real specific. Hilarious is he kind of had to do this because everybody knew what he looked like. He could just do just do Ali g except for people in these. You don't want someone goes.

Speaker 9:          02:00:37       Someone will notice she's famous. Not In those worlds. They don't. They. If he'd had no makeup on, no money in King Lewin who? Sacha Baron Cohen is. Do you know what I mean? The crazy thing is these people must. Must've had to signed releases. Yeah. And I did hidden camera shit, so I know how that works. I've done that too. How did they get us? Two ways. There's money, which is always the best way. And you make them sign before. That's, that's it. There's two ways to get rewards the way. Yeah. You'd make them sign, you know, we're going to be featuring you on this thing. We did this bit. Ian Edwards and I did this bit for comedy central for the show that never went. Um, I don't know if I've ever told you this, but we, this bit was so fun to do. We made a thing called Melanin Mayo Mayonnaise, mayonnaise, that, that made you darker, real shit.

Speaker 9:          02:01:22       And we put food coloring in Mayo, but we introduced it as new Brown Mayo. It's a new generation of Mayo. And so we got people in this test group. We know that real people in a real test group, they go and take tests all the time and they emanate sample shit. We put them in a room, we made them eat the sandwiches, just fucking mail is the eat the sandwiches, all these white people eat the sandwiches and then when they're done, we sent in this black dude al and she shows them a video and it was a pre tape video basically of white people confessionals who have turned. We've, you know, we photoshop them to have turned more brown to start to turn black online and we're like in three to five weeks you start to see results. You start to see cultural results, mental results you're getting, you're getting more black by culture, you're getting smarter, black, you're getting cooler black and your neighborhood to your friends.

Speaker 9:          02:02:04       Like their faces. Their faces were perfect. If we didn't have any volume, you'd have laughed. Everyone's like, wait a minute. No one said we be black. We'd be turning black. I mean, they lost their fucking minds. People got so scared. It was amazing. That was incredible. They MTV, comedy central never aired to any of that. Is it comedy central? Probably hasn't fucking vault. They throw away. Oh my God. Yeah. That was one of our favorite bits that we, that made us laugh so fucking hard. They're faces. One woman, one woman to her credit, she goes, she, you know, people are freaking out and the route people started yelling at him and they're like, this is, I'm going to fucking show you. I'm going to and he's black. And he said, Yep, I'm going to fucking sue your ass if I'm black. Kids like the flooding to watch him go.

Speaker 9:          02:02:49       It's not as bad as you're making it out to be. I mean, I was, I was born black and I'm liking it a lot and one woman goes, you know, it's disturbing because it's shocking just to spring this on me, but I don't, I'm, I'm not scared I could take on being black. I'll just, let's, let's, we'll see what happens. I mean, she was like, turn credit. She goes, we'll just, I'll just live with. We'll just figure this out. I guess. I mean, it was insane that they bought into it, but also that that's how we did it. We fucking made him sign beforehand and then you paid them out and when it's over we broke them off more money so they wouldn't say no because they still have the legal right to be like, I'm pulling that up. You, you pull it or I'm suing you.

Speaker 9:          02:03:24       So once it was over, did they understand that it was for comedy central after, after everything was said and done, and then do they laugh? A few did not laugh a few laps if you people are not, but that was one of my favorite bits. Melanin Mayo and man didn't work like a charm. People were like, this man needs is delicious. It was fucking almonds or whatever with a little brown dye in it. It's unconventional, but I really like so stupid. That's so funny. Yeah, that was a funny bit, man. They killed, murdered a bit. Seeing people think they're about to turn black and they panic and the black guys a presenter. That was the best part. We put our, you know, Al's up there and this guy named Al sheer is a great improv and he's in a room filled with fucking white people telling them they don't want to go black.

Speaker 9:          02:04:12       Oh my God. It was awesome. It was fun. So he was saying that he used to be white. No, no, he's saying he was the representative for the company. We loved the idea. We had images and video of people who had turned black white people who had turned black. But you didn't tell him till after the eight. That's exactly right. The food first. Then we showed them how we said it was a commercial because that was whole thing is like a new commercial campaign for, for whatever fake mayonnaise company we made up. And then we had said, here's the commercial, we're going to run along with it. What do you guys think? And we played the course. They were supposed to rate the commercial. That's what they do in those test groups, you know? Oh my God. Now what did comedy central? Why did they not?

Speaker 9:          02:04:53       They did. You know what's so funny is they, they, we overshot this pilot because I think they wanted way more bits for the sketch show and I just don't. They a lot of things they said they couldn't, they didn't want to air, they couldn't there. There's a few things that were just, he did some fucking great bits. I just think comedy central legal department was just having trouble with it because he, he was balls out. He did this thing called gangster gardener where we went to bel air where he just started. I'm like clipping people's lawns and planting trees with a group of Mexican dudes. And they were like, looked like there were thug the fuck out and these white dudes would come out like, what are you, what are you doing in my yard? So we planted trees. Motherfucking we try to get this motherfucker looking nice and these white dudes are like, no, I don't want it.

Speaker 9:          02:05:29       He's like, we landscaping. And then he was, he would hand them bills. He'd be like, yeah, that's 50 bucks, 50 bucks would that Bush? And these dudes were like, I'm not giving you money. You can't. You can't just like renegade do my lawn. He was like, that's how we make money out here these days in bed layer. It was like, Ooh, we got fucking. That was a tough day because everyone's like, I'm going to fuck it so you. I'm going to sue every motherfucker in that truck. I mean it was like. I mean there were fun days but a lot of days and that shit was like going through. You just feel people's anger bubbling over and they're going to murder somebody, but al was ruthless. He didn't give a fighting of a fuck. You don't have to be a certain type of person. He would go do any bit.

Speaker 9:          02:06:05       He would go to any bar he loved in racial shit was always his favorite was making white people feel uncomfortable to do a hidden camera show. You've got to be a different kind of person. Yeah. It's a beastly thing. I you to be a fucked up. You gotta be fucked up and he and he was fucking good. But yeah, Ian, Ian and I and another person wrote a bunch of those. Fucking weird stupid. It's got to be really hard to do something like that today, which is the interesting thing about the Sarah, Sarah, Sarah, Sacha Baron Cohen thing. Oh yeah. His head. He like showtimes take some chances. Yeah, but you know what? They took a chance because he is such a good horse to bet on and look at on that. Just on your youtube clip. That's not even a showtime clip. That was somebody else as 150,000 views on just a sec.

Speaker 9:          02:06:49       A clip and it's just really recent. Yeah, just they just put it out. Yeah, I mean his. They're circulating all over the Internet. It will just get way more traction as time goes on because it's so fun. Yeah. He's a killer. Free Pr to buy all the politicians saying that like before they even put out the shows, they're all like, we got duped. I got duped by them. I got duped. Dick Cheney, Sarah Pailin. They all came out and were like, they thought he fucked me over data and then they had a billboard that somebody said he was doing stolen valor. Did you see that? Yeah. What was that about? Because you said that he was, uh, an injured soldier and an X. Right. There was an ad for him as an ex soldier or something. And so that got a ton of fucking press. A ton of press wasn't at the Sarah Palin One? No, I wasn't. I don't know. You'd have to look it up. I don't remember which one it was. I think it was a Sarah Pailin

Speaker 1:          02:07:36       one. He was a disabled veteran, but they were saying right. Stolen Valor. Selling them out all the shit. Yeah. They were trying anything to discredit it. Well, but if it's a comedy series, it's a sketch comedy series. You tell me a sketch character can't play whatever they want. I mean, that's, that's what it is. That's, that's like people get mad. Say No. I mean if it's. If you can play a character on a fee, if you can play a war hero in a film, why can you play the opposite? Like born on the fourth of July. Tom Cruise. Okay. What's so funny? I was just thinking that I think the character, he has what he is. That is the the outright type guy. Oh yeah, yeah. Saying is a bunch of stuff like that. And showtime countered the claim here with the showtime counter. Sacha Baron Cohen stolen valor claim.

Speaker 1:          02:08:22       Yeah, the counter. Well, because they. Because it was made public as long statement about it, but widespread misinformation over the past week about the character of Billy Wayne Reddick junior phd performed by section. What is the counter? I think they explained what happened. They sort of said that they didn't misrepresent themselves. They probably thought he was someone riddick. Riddick was asked by the senator. He was disabled and he stated that he is not an uses, a mobility scooter to conserve energy. In addition, Bear Cohen never presented himself as a veteran of the US military, former Alaskan governor, Sarah Palin during the booking process or during the filming of her interview. Okay, so there you go.

Speaker 2:          02:08:55       Okay. Scroll down a little bit lower. Says on Monday a conservative street artists replaced a billboard near CBS television city complex in the Los Angeles with a doctored image of Cohen in a wheelchair wearing an army tee shirt. The new billboard was kept caption sa, Sacha Baron Cohen walks away with a hit and a touch of stolen valor. Touch.

Speaker 1:          02:09:18       Yeah. He's trying to say that it's a slight. It's a slight at the. At the troops. Yeah. Okay, but how dare you mock those who have fought and served our country. Truly sick. Mock politicians and innocent personalities. All you want

Speaker 2:          02:09:32       get balanced, pale and said, Pailin wrote on facebook. You run a disrespect of our US military and middle class Americans via Cohen. She's so stupid and middle class Americans. Fuck you. You're disrespectful to. That's. That's the disrespect, but just that, that trick. She's just trying to game the system by state and middle class Americans. Just get as many people in there as you can. Prevent Cohen's foreign commentaries under the guise of interview questions, foreign commentaries. What does that mean? Under the guise of she's so dumb because you imagine that lady almost became our vice president. Like what? What the fuck would they think? And they had mccain could have won. Yeah, yeah. He could have one. Yeah, she was the anchor that fucking sunk that book. But the idea that they thought that that was a good idea. Well, she was a pawn man. She was such an easy fucking pawn. I don't think so. I think shavers, I think she was used as this little, this good looking cute item, a

Speaker 1:          02:10:34       female, this middle American gun shooting she was upon. I think she was a play and it went too far. It was almost like they didn't know what they had gotten themselves into. They, I think they thought that was a. could been the. It's one of those ingredients that could have been brilliant or fucking the dumbest Shit on earth. She was the governor of Alaska. Right. They figured, hey, she's a good looking woman. She's the governor of a state. She's a mom. She shoots guns, disabled child. She had all the things that was like, wow, what a good pr push. Yeah. There was a disabled child while she was running. I'm almost positive. Right. She gave birth like almost like while she was. No, no, I think she already had had a disabled child. I think she had had a disabled kid. Her, her other son was a veteran, right or, or right.

Speaker 1:          02:11:13       And so she had all these things lined up that were perfect for America. So crazy. It was so good when they started interviewing her. So what, what newspapers do you read? All of them. All of them. All of them. I can see Russia from my front porch. Remember though, a second. See Russia? That was right. I look right across. I see Russia from my porch. I mean that. Those were like soundbites for, for America to be like she fucked. But trump does the same thing. He just does it in a. no, no, no, he, he, he does. I heard about that again the other day because I was listening to, uh, the, it's called the satire paradox. Revisionist history. Malcolm Gladwell, and they were talking about this, the therapy incident and a Tina fey actually said that and everyone thinks that's their appeal and actually said it.

Speaker 1:          02:11:55       It came from the snl spoof and completely got attributed to her. And genius also ruined that whole thing that she could see it from her front porch. That was from a sketch. That's not what she did. Say something about, she said something about Russia being there. Her neighbor, she did say something about Russia being closely. If they're going to come through Alaska. She did say something preposterous like that. If Russia came, they would go through her right on snopes, which isn't the best place to not be looking things up, but like they have the article about it and it says that this came from an snl skit. Okay. Well instead of googling that, just google Peyton's comment on being close to Russia. Right. She said it sounds like what? I googled. I googled Sarah Pailin restaurant from my house, but no, no, no, no, not that statement. Russia from my house say Pailin on Russia, being close to Alaska because she did say something. She didn't say something that ridiculous. Yeah. It wasn't as toy said something ridiculous enough that people were like, what? What are you saying that? And that's where through your neighborhood they got the influence to make that sketch. They're going to fly in jets, dummy. Take a walk right across thinking here's what's in Alaska.

Speaker 1:          02:13:03       But I think she. But I think that was just, you know, I suppose as she tweeted, remember I can keep an eye on them from here that her being like, let's basically that's the statement. But also. But I think this comes on the heels of her publicly during at press at some point had said something about it. It was kind of like how when trump says something once he repeats it over and over. Like if you have watched those clips, he'll say the same. The same anecdote because it, it, it starts to drain. The swamp wasn't once I was a thousand times. I've to Tom Arnold last night. I know Tom Arnold was backstage and he just got the trump tapes. He said we got a gang of tapes. He said there's some crazy shit. Yeah, I can't. I don't want to disclose anything. But yeah, he's. He said there is a tape. Yeah. Yeah. He said there's a tape of him saying the heart and word is repeated. I just made you a face. Like I was surprised at that for some reason your brain.

Speaker 1:          02:13:58       He said it's crazy. He said that the tapes are crazy and not putting them out again. It's vice vice. Yeah. And he said people are turning on him left and right because he doesn't have loyalty to those people that are around him. So apparently those people are turning on him left and right. And testifying and, and you know, giving up evidence and information. Like everybody realizes it's a sinking ship. We were talking last night, we're like, dude, it's only a year end. Yeah. One fucking year. One year. This guy's got three more years of this. Saw The news yesterday about the call that Colin has the tape and he said that trump knew about it. Oh yeah. And that's supposedly proves the collusion. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Does that work? What does that mean? Timing did know about the meeting with Russia. Collusion is, is, is proven.

Speaker 1:          02:14:47       Proven. Yeah. Then. And then it can be. He can be prosecuted. Kenny be a sitting president. Yeah. Right. If colluding. I think you have to be impeached before you can be like, well yeah, you wasn't president. Sure. Week, comfortable with President Pence. No fucking way. Is that happen? Do they just, can we have another election? Do it again. Can we do it again? We could. I mean, I don't know if a TA. It obviously hasn't happened, but I don't know if Congress can call an emergency election. This is the thing. Hillary has been ramping up the publicity lately. It's almost like she's ready to get back in there. Well, because she recognized because there's so much going on to try to. People are trying to bury him. Dude, pence will be scary to me. Man. That kind of scary. Scary now. He's not a good.

Speaker 1:          02:15:28       I agree candidate, but I'm second in line as him and that does freak me out to this kind of be a good Democrat out there. Yeah. Where it's not a compromised completely corrupt person has been embedded in the system forever and might've killed a bunch of portable. I think everyone that you would want to run wouldn't. I think you're right. I think that's how I always feel when I'm like, Oh, you know, it'd be great. It's like I'm not fucking running. What a nightmare gig to 100 grand a year to B to b. They make more than that now. What is it? Two 50, 400, maybe, maybe half a million, half a million, whatever before taxes. Which trump won't pay. Yeah, man, it's a. it's a terrible job. Terrible job and awful. Really. It should be a job that many, many, many people do. You one person's involved in the economy, ecology environments, everything.

Speaker 1:          02:16:21       Military shake. You play God. You're playing God. You have to puppeteer everything. That doesn't make sense. It wouldn't even work if you had a village. Yeah, and that would. That would collapse because one farmer you had allegiance to would get mad. Yeah. You had to control all the crops. You outta to control all the weapons you had to control all the. All the laws. What the fuck? Yeah. Get out of control at even a micro level. The weird thing is while he's president, can he start pardoning people? Will has had Disney. Did he decides to pardon a bunch of people while he's president? If he does that, what is it still good? If they put them in jail, if he pardons while he's in office, then there. Then there scot free. But you're saying after. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know. Like if he goes to jail, I don't know.

Speaker 1:          02:17:09       Pardon? People already already pardoned. Yeah, but he's saying like once I did a bunch of them, right? Yeah. He has a bunch of. Pardon? Jack Johnson, which is like a. that's not really going to help Cat Stevens. Still not. Pardon man. Peace train. Still not finished to Susan. Yeah. Dinesh D'souza. Right? He pardoned. Not Pardoned Cat Stevens. Don't know what I'm saying. But what is Cat Stevens in trouble for? You remember this? This was years and years ago. Cat Stevens, like a said, now he's a part of Muslim faith and he left the United States and another, but he also wanted a death for Salmon Rushdie. Salman Rushdie, and they wouldn't let him back in United States. They took away. They've. They took away his entry. Right? I don't even know if he's here now. He does. He goes concerts in Mexico. People go down to Mexico to watch Cat Stevens concert. Yeah. Where you can get them down in Cabo.

Speaker 1:          02:17:51       Is that true? Look it up with Cat Stevens is a lot of back in the United States. I don't think so. We're. Let's look up cat Stevens tour dates because he went to go see him. Let's go see if I'm being followed by a moon shadow. Shadow shadow will go see him in Tiawana. He's playing the border tour. Could you imagine if we went to see him? That'd be fucking fun. It'd be a fun piece to do. Events currently booked. Yeah, he's having a tough time. I think he did it because he needed some money. Oh totally. He didn't have his publishing rights or something like that. He lost money, so we went on a tour, try to get some checks, got some chatter, and then went back to the mosque. All that chatter. Bought some Hamas. Pass it around. Pita Pita, you guys. And you know. That's one thing that an artist can do.

Speaker 1:          02:18:39       That's a musician that a comic can't do. A musician can go back and do all their old hits and still raking it in mean the beach boys. They're not. They could still go on tour and at a drop of a hat and make a ton of money. Yeah. Well they also. They also bands now reconvened with new members and they make. They still do that shit. I mean the dead tour with John Mayer than fucking. They're big ships because hair. Yeah. John Mayer, the John Mayer handsome guy that hangs out with Dave chappelle tours with the dead. He tours with sing. Yes. Get the fuck were to God on my life, man. Get the fuck dead. Has that because he wants hippie pussy and deadheads. Love it. Love it. Why do they love it? I don't know. I got a couple of friends that are dead heads and I never was into the dead, but they were like, it's.

Speaker 1:          02:19:25       There were skeptic. There were skeptics at the beginning. They're in fucking love with that guy because he paid. Paid does it right man. He fucking pays homage to the right way. He's fucking God. Fucking insane. John. Fucking. Your body's a wonderland is playing dead. So that's the world where it can't get any more absurd. No, it can't. What does, what does it say about cat? He played some concerts in America in the last couple of days. A lot back recently. Who let them back in Obama, the Muslim, the Muslim hope that Kenyon article in the New Yorker about his comeback last year. So last year he got let back in. Wow. Maybe a couple of years ago. I'm much so it was before trump, so it was probably one of Obama's last moves and office for sure. Let them back in from on. Fuck them. Fuck the Donald. We gotta go. We gotta go to a cat.

Speaker 1:          02:20:17       It's shown up knowing God, you got to go cat. So it was within a year. Maybe you won't come back now that trump's president. I mean for money. He'll fucking go anywhere. I'm sure it's your last year. Maybe it was the last. The last year was last year. Yeah. He's saying now the trump is around. He probably won't come back. That's so funny. Where was he living? Did it say where he was? Just doesn't say specifically. Yeah, he was on the fucking news on the Lam. That cat was gone. Yeah, he's in Libya or some shit. Fuck yeah. Hold up in a compound in a cave and shit. What a weird move. Huh? A guy who sings, he's like really? Pc Sof. He's trained. Whole fucking shit was out of picking up people from coast to coast of the peace train. Well, there's people that believe that Islam is the religion of peace.

Speaker 1:          02:21:01       Totally. The southern. A lot of people believe in that shit, so maybe he thinks he's on the path to peace and I think Islam is probably like every other religion, right? There's factions of Christianity that are wonderful people. Sure. Really calm and sweet and loving and they get a lot out of it. And then just people that are just fucking loons and the serpent handlers. Yeah man. Those fucking people as Christians. Those are my favorite Christians. The ones with the snake protect me from the serpent. The snake, the snake. My whole family had been surfing handlers. Sense Wade was sweater. We've been a part of the serpent culture serpent or serpent? Paypal and they use poisonous snakes too. Oh yeah. Wasn't there a documentary on serpent handlers? I feel like there's a documentary that I have on my queue. I have so much shit. I'm supposed to watch the students.

Speaker 1:          02:21:52       I'm so behind on the. I got to walk away. I'm only in wild wild country. I'm only on episode four. I need to. It's good, but it's slow at the big chunks of slow days where you're like, people say that it could have been done in three, could have easily. There's a lot of drag out that you're like, didn't we go over this already? But that's just them being like, fuck, come on Netflix. Netflix wants six. I want six. You want six? Six netflix. They don't need more fucking money. They own Hollywood there. I couldn't get out 30 comedy specials just from just for laughs. That's nothing that bill sent me. They can't even. They weren't even sniff. One of my fucking far. I can't even fucking get near them for some reason. Netflix wants nothing to do with me. I don't know what the fuck they're thing is with me.

Speaker 1:          02:22:39       Maybe I did something wrong years ago. They're doing putting out so many specials. I'm like, how come I can't get anything to do with you? I don't know. They probably haven't seen you. You know, the thing is, man can keep up. Yeah. No, I think there's too much going on. The only thing keep up. Did they have enough people? I really don't. I mean, I feel like there's so much comedy going on right now. Have you ever seen more standup? Never in my life. It's, it's overwhelming. There's a lot more shit comedy being put out than I've ever seen or, or not shit comedy in terms of my opinion in terms of like, just see just comedy for the sake of comedy. Then I'm like, this isn't a fucking well put together. Special people didn't take time for. Some of these things are pumping them out. Yeah, there's definitely that too.

Speaker 1:          02:23:20       And there's people that are taking advantage of an opportunity, right? Somebody offers you a shitload of money and you don't really have a set ready. Oh, they just fucking want to do that. That's the one thing that happens with people when they start doing movies. When you start doing movies, you're on a set 16 hours a day. You don't really have enough time to write and you're definitely not performing every no way. That is a crazy move to be doing all these films and then do an hour special when you. You're barely. Yeah, they can do 30 and they're pushing 30 on fun shit in between maybe even 30 men because not even 30, like a real rock 'em sock. 'Em robots 30 know a really know it's probably not a back to back 30, like bang, Bang, Bang, Bang. It's more thin than that. There's a lot of shit out there.

Speaker 1:          02:24:05       Louis said this to me once backstage and I think he's right. He's like, in order to do comedy, to really do it. You can't do anything else. That's probably the only way to be the best at it was you could do it and you can do it good, but to be at your best, you really can't be doing anything else. I believe that. I believe that wholeheartedly. Yeah. Miami thinking you have podcasts because podcasts are just talking. Yeah. This, this is working out for working out at comedy to do a special like podcasting and comedic relationships and us still moving in whatever realm that is for comedy, if it's all branching for it, but other things. Acting that takes totally away from it. Yeah, because when I go do acting shit, I'm totally disconnected. Comedy loses its breath for awhile. Well, what about when you were doing acting on?

Speaker 1:          02:24:49       I'm dying up here. I performed them almost every night. Right? I didn't give a fuck. I was burning the candle at both ends. I didn't care because you had to. Because I know because I also know that I don't want to lose steps. I was like, I don't want to fucking lose steps. Yeah. I care about acting. Not as much as I care about standup. Yeah. You care about it like. Yeah. That's cool. I like it a lot. It's not your thing. No. I'm in love with stand up. Acting is like. Yeah, I like it. I like it a lot. It's very rewarding. I'm not. I'm not and I'm not disrespecting the art. I'm just saying it doesn't do the same thing for me that stand up does. Right, but what if I don't go out at night and try to make sure I'm on booking shows late night

Speaker 9:          02:25:25       to do you lose. You definitely get disconnected. Peep and they people who do it know who they are. They know when it happens. Sure. Tend to do sitcoms to the sitcoms will do it to youtube because you're on set. I killed it for me, man, when I was on news radio, there was a stretch where I was doing set. I was doing standup for a couple of years where I was from writing any jokes, just doing the same shit shit and I was getting disconnected with the jokes and I was starting to bomb. And then you hate him. You hate the material. Well, you talked to jeff to a couple of days ago in Garland. You know he does it. He just goes in wings it all the time because he loves it. He doesn't want to fuck because he's on set all fucking day, so I don't know where he's finding time to write stuff anyway because Jeff's like, no, I just like to have fun because he doesn't.

Speaker 9:          02:26:07       He doesn't have any time. He's. He's doing 50 things at once. He doesn't have time to sit down and go, all right, let me try to pump out some new material. He's not on a plane, on the road to shows today's on to hit to hit shows. Isn't it funny too? He's saying that he doesn't want to do 15 minutes sets. I just do like an hour on Friday and see items now or. I disagree with it too. I didn't understand it when he said it's a waste of my time to leave the house. The first thing I said, I'm in my kitchen listening to it and if he's gone, I'm not gonna. Leave my house. Fifteen minutes ago. Fucking joe sitting right across your. He leaves his house for fucking 15 minutes. I did it last night. Yeah, no shit. Constantly talking about. Yeah. I think it's a different.

Speaker 9:          02:26:39       I think it's just a different breed of certain people are like that, that they're like, Nah, on maximize that time and only do it at this chunk, but certain people you meet, if I. That is the maximizing of the chunk of being. Like if it's just 15, I'm going to. I'm going to make sure that 15 is. He doesn't have bits though. Not the same way. Like he's just a funny guy. He raves and Improv in Improv. Yeah, but he doesn't have like a chunk on lava lamps and they're gone wristwatches, you know, he doesn't have that like I to open up with lava lamps. That's not this what he does. Well No, like he did a fallon set a couple of years ago. Maybe it was a year ago, two years ago, and it was all about lotion at the airport and that was like a bit.

Speaker 9:          02:27:20       That was the first time I'd seen jeff do a. because you know, again, again, this is obviously no disrespect to Jeff. I Love Jeff. Jeff's a great guy to me, but what he does is, yeah, it's that it's much more like free form and unfailing. He did like a bit. I was like, oh, that's like a bit. And I. Jeff doesn't really do bits. It doesn't chunk out bits. He's like, if he finds a bit it'll be great. You know what I mean? But he usually just fucking around. I watched him in Atlanta. We were both playing Atlanta at the same time. He was just, he was shitting on like a one of the other comics and it was, it was hysterical. He was just fucking around with the other conflict. One of the other comics that went on before, but the, that took up 15 minutes of him just fucking around and then got into like talking to them while he's loose.

Speaker 9:          02:27:59       Oh. So I mean, one of the funny things that he said was that he's so comfortable with just being funny. Oh, and I have to tell Andrew dice clay, he was not disrespecting you. Dice dice went on this whole rant about fat. Jeff given them a hard time, he thinks because garland was saying that it was Rick Rubin's idea to do the day. The laughter died. Dice is like, no, it was my fucking. I fucking was very upset. He was very happy. He get really mad. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Dice kits map like that though. That's so strange. I know he got. I know he goes. I know. There was all sorts of a dicer. Sebastian. Weird, strange fucking beat. What happened there? I don't know dude. It was like Sebastian dice had said something online I guess on instagram about Sebastian stealing his act or doing his shit.

Speaker 9:          02:28:49       Emulating him or something like he was going after Sebastian for some fucking reason. So passion is very original. He's him. No one is Sebastian, but that's who he is. Well, I think sometimes can use to open for him years and years and years ago is um, if I'm not wrong people. Correct. You're right. And I think maybe dice felt like he's not giving them as do. It's like dissecting, like I fucking raised you and you're not even going to kiss the ring a little bit. First of all, grown ass man who's built his own career completely on his own and brilliantly so he has no anybody shit, wasn't it that he didn't talk about Dyson as book perhaps? That's probably the crux of it. I think it's the layers for the for, for, for old friendships like that that have gone sour. Maybe it's layers. It's that. It's why don't you go to my fucking dinner party?

Speaker 9:          02:29:30       You know what I mean? It's bullshit. It's all bullshit piled up when you get a guy opening for you for years and then he's smashing it. Now he's a fucking superstar. Yeah. That's got to feel weird. It's got to feel it. It's got to feel weird. I'm envious of what Sebastian's done because Sebastian can kind of go anywhere. Yeah. It does anything, but I mean, he's like, he's really successful, but he's also like this weird kind of famous. Well, he could like go to the movies. He's famous restaurants famous. He's famous, but buddy sells out tickets like he's mega famous. Well, we talked about this when I was in Vegas. I walked by. Gaffigan was playing one of the things, one of the arenas there and had a billboard up that said, you know, Jim Gaffigan, 28, 29, whatever, and I was saying to the comic that I was with, I was like, isn't that funny that like if Gavin was just like walking through the casino, there's a good chance a lot of people just wouldn't see him see him.

Speaker 9:          02:30:22       Do you know what I mean? They might, they might, but in that fucking arena sold out five shows. Sold out like unmistakably famous and standup. Yeah. But he's the Kinda guy that could go to Ralph's and you'd be like, uh, someone will go. I think that that guy he looks like maybe he's not. I don't know. Do you know what I mean? Like these songs, but hey, hot pockets. Hot pockets. Yeah. Be it. Can I get a selfie selfie bro? Come on, man. I like going. I like going with you to watch how people ask you for selfies. My favorite thing is when I'm with Joe and somebody asked me if they can take a picture of Joe. That's the. No, look at me. We're talking, hey, do you mind to me? I'm not his fucking hand. Why are you asking me? That's the. That's so annoying to me. Don't look at me dude, if you want to converse with a grown man, do it and not your through line to get to Joe Gaffigan's doing an interesting thing. He decided to. He on his own to not put a special on Netflix. It was a conscious because

Speaker 1:          02:31:20       he felt like there's so many digital platforms on who's going to offer it among all the other platforms, so he's got it on. Amazon's got it on Hulu. Who's got it everywhere? We're where the see find out the places. Gaffigan put out his special on. I've seen the billboard and it mentioned. Is that on the bottom it says available on all platforms. I have seen that Amazon platform. Replatform step. Netflix. Yeah. He has been kind of crazy. I get that he wants to. He stood out his whole career as being a clean. You know what I mean? Like I think this is another way of him being like, I'm also not grouped like that as well. I think that he made the decision was that there's just so many other platforms available that he didn't want to limit it to Netflix and be one of the many on Netflix already.

Speaker 1:          02:31:59       You know, may. I mean it might be actually a smarter, more lucrative move. Although the access that people have probably isn't as good as you think. Netflix is a global brand. That's the problem with giant huge. It's just the thing. Yeah. But if you have it on youtube, youtube is probably bigger than anything, right? More people watched this. Youtube has a bigger reach, but it's just way more content on youtube. Right. But here's the other thing. Who's watching youtube on television at home, the new gender. There's a lot of kids that are due because now youtube TV is like a big thing, but how many in comparison to to watch Netflix and I'm sure Netflix to launch that ass Netflix at home. Netflix owns that ass. I would think about the mobile though. How many people watch Netflix on their phone? A lot. I think there's one netflix or one.

Speaker 1:          02:32:48       I just did my special. They said half the people, so it is on youtube too. Yeah. Have people found a netflix watching on their phone? Well, look at it like this. I've never pulled up youtube on my, on my computer. I mean I, I, I rarely. I'm saying I put it on my phone every fucking day. There's something on my phone that I'm looking up on Youtube. Yeah, that's true. Always, always, always, always on the phone and if I'm at the house, if I had watching something on my phone and I'll flick it to my apple tv or whatever, he put it in movie theaters for a day too. That's cool. That's a cool move. While it's on the move. Well how many, how long is it? Seventy minutes. Seventy minutes. That seems like annoying to go to the movies for 70 minutes. Yeah. However you have an opening act.

Speaker 1:          02:33:30       You fuck. He's got a warm up guy that just stands up there on a 90 minute show. Come on. When we were backstage last night, we were like, you know, because we had a lot of guys on the show last night, the late show. We're like, this show's going to go long. We're like fucking scorsese movies at three hours trying matches. Scorsese movie that. That fucking main room needs a new AC unit though was drenched. I was soaked through a tit sweat when you gave me a hug when I brought you on, I didn't want to hug you because my fucking shirt was stuck to my body and my mind was minutes. I was totally drenched by the time I got upstairs and just fix it. Well, they are struggling with money over there. Fucking money. It's a money pit. Isn't it crazy that that place used to be struggling for money and now they just. They sold out two shows in the main room yesterday. Showing the, Oh, are showing

Speaker 2:          02:34:18       the fucking bell. It was just people constantly running through that place. Last night, every room was sold out. There's not a club like that on the planet or. Nope. Doesn't exist. Well, that's what the dude runs. The social media was saying last night. He was like, you gotta understand like just for laughs is going on right now. This has a way better lineup.

Speaker 9:          02:34:34       Yeah, and when just for laughs used to go on at the store, it was like ghost towns, ghost town. It was like no, comics were in town anymore. Audience people weren't even coming out. Now just relapse. You wouldn't even know what's happening. There's still so many bangers in town. It doesn't even fucking matter. It's just

Speaker 2:          02:34:48       weird time. Weird time for standup. Best time it's popping. Would you know, I wonder what is the. I mean there's so many different. It's so you can't really have one factor. There's not just one factor, but these, the Internet for sure is the underlying machines, like more people have access to standup comedy through youtube and all these other different ways. Netflix and then on top of that it's podcast, like comics get together and people. Those podcasts become a part of people's lives daily live their drive and then on top of that that podcasts are talking about the store. Like everyone's talked the store, the store was taught and that because you go to the laugh factory tonight.

Speaker 9:          02:35:26       Yeah, you hear crickets. Tumbleweeds. It's just different because the laugh factory doesn't have the same kind of talk that comics talk about the store. The store is romanticized by Comedians. It's just like that. It's that spot. I mean, Shit, when you look at the Echo, look at the instagram for the comedy store. Every time they put a lineup, read almost every single comment. We'll have someone go, fuck man, I wish I didn't live in Xyz. I would kill to be there. It's crazy and it's Wednesday. It's Wednesday night, Thursday night, and they're like, dude, if I could fucking pay for a flight, I would do it right now. If I could afford it,

Speaker 2:          02:35:58       kill. We have this virtual reality thing. The htc vive. You put the headphones on and you ever seen that? Yeah, it headset. You put the goggles on earplug. They're going to do standup in that thing. One hundred percent, 100 percent. There's no doubt. But in thinking about that a lot lately, when you put that fucker on and you feel like you're in the room with that, like that would be an amazing way to broadcast. Stand up into your living room. Fuck, yeah, you could be at the store, on your fucking couch. Just standing up. Might even be better. It might be kind of cooler than actually be in there. Not Cool will be in there now being there's always going to be cooler, but cool in a unique different way.

Speaker 9:          02:36:35       Well, it's an. I think it's just another ad, right? Like to me you're always gonna want live performance because we always have in the history of humanity, we love watching performance live and that's just another way for people to access who physically can't get there. It's always going to be sexier to be there because you feel like you're a part of it. But to actually be someone in there in the virtual world that will be justice. I mean for people that can't physically be here, I think that's just, that's the closest you can get. That's the best you can get when you're there. It's live, you know, it's just a different kind of thing. No, stand up to me on tape. Has ever been as funny as it is live?

Speaker 2:          02:37:08       No, no, no, no. Not even close you the best you can hope on a television show, so it's just kind of capture a feel

Speaker 1:          02:37:16       of it. When you're doing a special for television, what is this is as close as they are getting right now. Holy Shit. This is like a virtual audience and like a almost like fake movie theater type situation and you're all watching the screen together. You can look around and see people and you watching the World Cup. This was for the World Cup. Well to start with what sets? So you sit down and you feel like you're in awesome seats at the World Cup. This happening at the same time that a couple of websites are starting with their calling. Watch parties where you watch videos? No, my friends together online at the same time. This is the actual World Cup. This was for the World Cup. So you actually watched the real game with those goggles on and you're fucking in the third row. Look how good that looks to and then look at the hard rock ad so they can put ads up.

Speaker 1:          02:38:05       Well, that's where they're going to start making all their money. Damn, that looks amazing because like, you know, you've seen it. A lot of sporting events. They use green screen on their ads girls so that they can change for television. I mean that'll just be that. It'd be the same thing, dude. How dope would that be for UFC fights? Fuck the HTC vive one wasn't the UFC do that. Call them up. They do do experimental things all the time. Right? That they try out and then they don't always use them. Yes. Yes, but that seems like the best one with those guys on. And that way you could be in the cage. You put a camera on the fucking guy who was a referee, the ref ref cam to shoulder camps and some hip cams put cameras all over him. Cam circling him a camera.

Speaker 1:          02:38:44       Make the fucking ref cameras to do that in pride and pride to Gopro and Gopros. Yeah, and you'd be able to see it from the Ref Cam, but those are just shit. You'd have to get really good cameras. They used to be shitty. They're pretty God damn good now for Vr, they got to be really good cameras. Right? Don't take Gopros. They can get it now. It's. I mean, yeah, I think they could probably could do it. I bet someone could pull this, our gopros always with that fish islands. Sort of. Yeah. You got to use some software to. To not have that, if you will, because they're built like that. They're built with the fish eye on. Why do they do that? Just for perspective angle field of view, because it's because it was originally intended for extreme sports and so that that's always the best view in every.

Speaker 1:          02:39:22       Every extreme sport is the fish. I looked great. I think you're trying to recreate your eyes like you have a, you know you have 180 degree or probably more than that, but it's not all just stored it. That's the problem. Everything's gets all stretched out and weird at the edge of class. I don't think anyone's figured out that yet too hard, you know, but that's why the. That's why they're like that. Like what four K is is inching towards live, live, live broadcast in four k is crazy. They say four k is more clear than the human eye. Can see there's elements to it that are clearer than what human I can actually see. And they're going higher than 14. Yeah man. What are they doing now? Are they doing something? Eight k cameras. What is that camera that you're getting that phone with? The red phone. The red got. Damn. I always forget the name of it, but it's a reds. So it's a cell phone. Like with the red, the camera, the Red Technology Company read, made a phone and explained. Read that. It's like a super high end camera. They ferry fees with

Speaker 2:          02:40:14       just for all high end things. They, I think they based started like $20,000 or something like that. That's just, that's not even the lens. That's just the physical fucking camera itself. Yeah. The bulk of $5,000. Battery or not really but. So it gets really expensive. But anyway. So this is supposed to be like a modular piece that's supposed to work with some systems they have coming in the future. This like the base of the, of the phone might connect to a camera or my connect to a series of other things it might replace. Um, I think they actually said that says two cameras on the back. So anyway, the other cool part of it is the display is holographic, which no one's actually seen yet because it's a new technology like playback can be in the warrant. They supposed to release his phone over a year ago.

Speaker 2:          02:40:52       They showed it a year ago. And when did you buy it then? On preorder? I think I bought it last about a year. What do they clip you for? How much we're, that's the same price as a iphone and the 1200 bucks I just had to prepay it, get 1200 bucks so they can advance the technology they needed. The money I imagined. So yeah, we all paid for. I think so, yeah. And then just trusting read because it's not, you know, it's a fly by night, but they're also getting, I'm sure tons of a VC investors to keep pumping money to keep that going. That's the kind of thing that the technology is so far ahead, they're trying hard to get the hardware to a place where it works. And when is this supposed to come out? I'm supposed to be shipped next month. So in the next four weeks have some people.

Speaker 2:          02:41:35       There might be the testers out. Imagine some magical day, like they're not going to tell you, but like August eighth for instance. Well August, August ninth is when the Samsung Galaxy note nine comes in matching. That's probably gonna come up with similar ads coming out. Now apparently it's going to have the most storage of any phone. The biggest battery, it's going to $4,000, million amp battery. It's going to have insane cameras. This is Samsung's last hurrah with the note and the note doesn't work this time. They're just gonna stick with the galaxies because the galaxy s nine did not do well. It didn't sell well, but it was an amazing phone, but it was too close to the galaxy. S eight. It wasn't much different. It was just like a. An incremental step better as opposed to like the iphone 10 is kind of way better than the iphone seven, you know, the seven and eight.

Speaker 2:          02:42:19       It's just like the shape is better. The fact that all it has is this little tiny little notch at the top. It's all screen. It's pretty dope. Camera. I don't know who I was. I don't know who was talking about it. I think it would maybe be a comic, but they were like, man, if Steve Jobs was alive, that would have never been up there that notch. He was such a meticulous fucking dude. Weiwei has an amazing phone called the mate are or the [inaudible] pro. This is the always the company that trump is keeping from selling cell phones. Oh yes. States. And there was an article here. I'll send it to Jamie. There was an article that we were talking about this yesterday with Dr Deborah. So. And then there's an article on a, I think it's on bg are here, I'll send you this right now.

Speaker 2:          02:43:04       But they were saying there's no reason why they shouldn't have this phone for sale. Like there's some fucking weirdness going on. But this, um, this one, uh, porsche design made their own version of it. Porsche design made a mate 10 rs. They caught like rally sport, like their cars, the cars like my gt three Rs. And they, um, they took away the notch, like fuck that notch. Like we're just going to have a thin bezel on the top. And then one on the bottom, you can't have a notch. No Porsche designs. Like, nope, no, no, fuck that fucking nuts. But that's what I feel about what that guy. I got mad at a guy at apple and I said, I said they fucked me over on an appointment or something that was being a dick. And I go, you know, if that guy was alive, this company will still be doing better.

Speaker 2:          02:43:47       And he was like, okay, that's me. And I was like, I'm just saying, I mean, yeah, they took a tank when that guy died. It's definitely gone. So down to laptops are dog shit, dog shit. They're so bad. They're beaten. They're getting class action lawsuits about the keyboards fucking up new small smartphone. Trump tried to ban drop to its lowest price ever on Amazon. But this is the problem is it's the best camera in any smartphone is three cameras on the back. It's fucking amazing. 40 megapixel camera. Holy Shit. But the problem is it won't work on all bands in the United States because it's European design. It's not, it's not built for this and it's only, it's only gsm. So you have to use it on a and t or t mobile 10 by one by one for 800 bucks. But it's supposed to be the fucking shit and the, the screens.

Speaker 2:          02:44:38       Amazing. You've got to be able to jailbreak and manipulate those films and make them easier to, you know, because they're not designed for the same bands. He says right there, you could buy it right now. Seven hundred 95 bucks. But the thing is, it's just, I don't think it works exactly the same. I think if you have an at and t phone. Let's see. That's a SIM factory unlocked. So you can use any international Sim Sim on those. Yeah, but the problem is the radio, the frequencies that it picks up, it doesn't pick up the same. All the same bands. It's like 18 t or t mobile has does not work with sprint, verizon, US cellular and other cma cameras. Those are cdma because it's a GSM phone. But the thing they're saying is that even if you get a GSM network like t and t or I'm going to have to ask one of the dudes that I know like Lewis from unbox therapy or a flossy Carter, those guys that do those videos, they would know.

Speaker 2:          02:45:32       40 megapixel camera for my first digital camera that I ever had was like five. I think mine was one thing that I was like, that's fucking bad. I was. It was bullet, but back then I remember being like, Christmas, look at these fucking Christmas photos. That point I was trying to make us sit with the Wifi like that without making a phone call and dialing the numbers. There are so many other ways you could communicate with the people you need to communicate with and still make a phone call. Yeah, that point's not valid because the places where you can use that Wifi, you also get signaled that you could use that phone on. The real issue is in the places where signal sketchy. Like

Speaker 1:          02:46:10       weird rural areas from Mississippi tweeted me and said he's been doing it for years so he has no cell service or Wifi, Wifi phone. He gets around. He's like are you could probably do it better and larger cities than I do in Mississippi, but I've been doing it for a long time. Right. But so he's going off of like starbucks sell Wifi or what's he doing? Or your house or like all the places you go to. I did that in Japan, but when you're in your car driving down a rural road, this is the point. You're not going to get a service. Nope. You're not going to get Wifi and you're not going to get cell phone service, but with a t and t or t mobile, they would have some service in these weird areas. That's the only place where these phones to be a problem is the weird areas.

Speaker 1:          02:46:47       Spots in la it would work fine. Yeah. Yeah, and those weird areas than like that. There's more problems than just not being able to connect to beans in a weird area. Exactly. See you there, Bro. Maybe you're hunting. You know, put your phone away. They're looking for fucking looking for pussy. Looking for forest. I'll look for obscure. Pushy. I don't like pussy. Were low density environments like kitchen. Gayle out. Camping her up. Anita come. No. Bring them a poetry. Forced her to listen. Can I read you something? Oh, it was that the worst. Somebody wanted to read you their poetry. That might be the worst thing other than I want you to listen to my music and have a seat. No. Play my music for you. Nah. I'm going to jump out the window of this place. Not even play the music, but play a recording.

Speaker 1:          02:47:38       You listened to my shit. You listen, you're going to put this record on this record. I got to go. Where's your bathroom? I'm leaving now. Fuck out. I did that. That's really funny. There's a. This is my buddy and I. We got into. We got kicked out of a party for being fucking rude and obnoxious and this famous chick took us back to her place with her boyfriend and we're all hanging out and he's like, dude, let me put on my shit now. I'm not kidding. He's playing his music. My Buddy's looking at me like, how are we going to get the fuck out of here? I go, I got to go to the bathroom, went to the bathroom, left my buddy there.

Speaker 5:          02:48:08       Did. I did. I was like, I'm not. Listen to this bullshit. I don't care if they're fucking famous. I'm out. I went home. If you did that to me, I would cry laughing if you left me in the living room and they were like, where's Andrew? I'd be like, did he texted me like six times. I didn't respond. I was like, no, I will be howling left. That motherfucker left me because you've put on that music bullshit as you put it on the music. Hey, I think the music's great, but Andrew like throw me under the bus. He's a big music fan. He doesn't like that Shit and handle it.

Speaker 1:          02:48:39       All right, let's, let's bring this bitch home. Andrew Santina will be with me Saturday night in Temecula all day, but Django casino two shows. Sold the fuck out. Sold out hard

Speaker 5:          02:48:51       the next weekend. Come see me in Philly. If you're out in Philly, come see me next weekend. We had a good God damn time the Chicago Theater to Kansas City and St Louis. Let's go. Kansas City August 10th. St Louis is something other than August 10th the next day. Figure it out, Joe Rogan. Love you guys. Bye.
