Speaker 1:          00:00:02       Hello, sweet pitches. That's right. The time has come. Once again, our I should fear as eaton box. This episode is brought to you by legal zoom. Legal zooms away, a convenient way to deal with a lot of your legal shit that you would normally have to go to a lawyer to deal with it online and deal with it naked can be drunk. Nobody can stop you. You could. You could say after everything that you write lies, you can say that lie. You can say your call Phil. Yeah, you could. You could curse the world, curse God himself as you're signing legal documents. You could be having sex and getting an LLC at the same time. No one can stop you. You have ultimate freedom because this all exists in the virtual world. You don't have to worry about pulling your cock out at the lawyer's office.

Speaker 1:          00:00:48       Like what if you were cool with paying your wife divorced money, but you wanted to jerk off as you signed the check. Yeah. Just to remind yourself of what a pathetic fucking full you are. You get trapped in these terrible relationships that you'd wind up being financially committed to these people that you really never got along with ever for the rest of your fucking life. And so as you're writing that down, you just jerk off all over his desk. I bet someone want to do it. Can't do it, but you can do it at home. You can get divorced at home while jerking off. No one can stop you. You can, um, you can get a will for $69 bucks. You can incorporate or form an LLC starting at 99 bucks and nine slash ll say once you're all so you can do whatever the fuck you want.

Speaker 1:          00:01:28       The environment no one can see you face is totally about community. It's like that. It's a limited liability company. Limited liability. It's interesting. Probably should be illegal, but uh, if, if, if it exists, you called it, they're just like that and how we can come to us. Yeah, I'm legal.

Um, these kettlebells that we have made, we have a artistic talent kettlebells to the Zombie bells and the primal bells and what they are is kettlebells that looked bad ass.

Speaker 1:          00:08:16       They look like their sculptures. They're made by this kid, Steven, this kid, these young kids these days with her artistic talent. Man, he might not be a kid on he didn't know his name his age. Uh, Steven Shubin Jr. He created the primal belt. YeaH, the monkey one and apes. And then he also did the new ones which are zombie bells. They're all balanced out because one of the things about a kettle bells is it's all about swinging this ball. There's heavy steel ball and it's all about balancing it and controlling it. And if the ball was off, like with these faces, it could easily be off. So we had them. A part of the artwork is that they had to be three d to make sure that they still are a kettlebells that you can train with with no problems. I train with mY guerrilla all the time and it's, you can work out with it just like a rug or kettlebell.

Speaker 1:          00:09:04       You just have to be cognizant of where the head is facing, but you should know that anyway and you'd be fine. But I trained with them my favorite all time exercise for strength and conditioning. And I don't even mean if you're an athlete, if you're an athlete, they're fantastic. I mean, they're really great for also for educating your body to work as one unit. you know, carrying a heavy, heavy kettle bell into and things like cleans and presses and things along those lines. Um, but it's Also, they're great for regular life. They are great for just being able to pick up a couch and help move it. They're great for. It's better to have a body that works a little better. A body that can be strong body that it doesn't break when you try to bring home groceries, get your shit together, bitch. That's what I'm trying to say.

Speaker 2:          00:09:48       I like that. That little bitch at goblins, not even his army. The little one is a goblins over there saying brian brains. Obgyn gardens. Brain zombieland bring goblin. I think it's a. I think that's still a zombie dude. It goblins zombie, but I shouldn't have. They should have one that's shaped like, it looks like a pretty girl going to work. Yeah. It's. I mean this doesn't look like it goes face thrilling. Like funny name but doesn't look like a zombie to you. That looks like a zombie. That doesn't quite get ghost. No. No ghost ghost there. That's solid mass. Yeah. That's mad. You can't see through that shit. You know, it's frankenstein and ship anything. Yeah. Yeah. That's a zombie dude gobble. Oh wait. Zombies are the ones that know that. Yeah. It's definitely not a ghost. Yeah. Well, can't go look like anything who can say you can see through it goes, you know what's fucked up man? It's really fucked up what they've done with vampires. What do you mean they've given new rules to like vampires? Oh really? You can go out in the sun as long as seattle. Well, two people did it. It happened twice. Once it happened with blade, which I forgave. It was. Why was he a day walker? He's half vampire. He was born, his mom.

Speaker 1:          00:11:08       He was born and he became half vampire. Not like totally vampires, some weird sort of hybrid thing. But uh, so stephen dorff was the main vampire tooth and

Speaker 2:          00:11:18       could go outside with sunscreen. Oh really? Yes. Ridiculous. That's the worst. No you can't. No, you better have magic or something. He can't just fucking put sunscreen on. You're a vampire man. You, you burn instantly. Hey, we wrote this when he's outside during the day, like we'll figure it out. Writer. I don't remember that from the comic book either because blade was a favorite comic book of mine. I was always a big comic book fan. I love blade. I don't even remember as a comic book. Oh, he was awesome. He would fight fucking fight vampires and shed. He used to teach knife in those, uh, those books.

Speaker 3:          00:11:54       It was cool when he showed up at that party, it was cool to look. Man I know was supposed to fight that guy. But I'm a wesley snipes fan. I think he was awesome. He's in prison now. He's out now. He's back doing movies again. He, uh, he was awesome in blade. Yeah. Apparently he was completely craZy by the time blade to I guess come rogan use a codeword rogan. This is, we're obviously doing a podcast when fuck the music man. Our experience here, we don't have to do this. The um, by the time he was doing like blade two or three, apparently he was off the handle. PaTton oswald has wrote a whole blog entry about it on meeting. I'm describing it, describing, uh, he might've performed it somewhere. He, he might have performed it, I'm not sure, but we're hearing about it. I thought, holy shit.

Speaker 3:          00:12:42       It was crazy. It was like Ryan O'neal and him. And apparently this was. Wesley was like, he was gone. He was, you know, just off the deep end, crazy on the set. And so they replaced him with what patent called much cooler black guys. They replaced him with another guy, did the martial arts stuff and yeah, because I couldn't deal with them. I don't know. I don't know what the fuck happened. Why wasn't he already sort of a movie star? He went crazy in between there and there are probably some substances were involved. It's always that. It's usually, it's always that. Yeah. Then you see them like taken whatever. You're like, oh, oh, oh. It's also, I don't think we can imagine what it's like to be that famous. I think for some people it's just. And then you get hooked up with the wrong people in your life and you're fucking around with the wrong friends and getting in trouble.

Speaker 3:          00:13:35       So many of them. Elvis. Yeah, it's, it's, it's a well, the nature of the business, like if you're a fucking person who's in the limelight that heavily, like the nature of the business becomes very bizarre. You know the nature of your reality. You're getting around. Everyone treats me like a, like a, like a commodity. What we were talking about justin bieber, like how justin bieber, the kids everywhere he goes, people fucking freak out just to see him. Like, oh, he's like, it's some weird alien. You know, we, we can't imagine what the forum now sort of in a way. I mean, it's not an ideal way to live. It seems awesome. Like don't feel bad. He's got all this money, but know it's so crazy, like burden to throw on some bread. Totally told me he got into an elevator with Jessica Simpson and she, she turns to the woman who's with us because he's not supposed to be in here.

Speaker 3:          00:14:23       Human. Yeah. It was just going up through whatever his room and he was in no way. Oh my god. Yeah. Well, you know what though? How do you start expecting that? It is totally wrong, but in her defense, to be her as a woman and be super duper super famous, she must be so vulnerable. IT must be weird to the opportunity to. For a guy to get in an elevator with her like men want. She's not used to it so much. There's so many men who like and a guy who knows that he could probably physically take advantage of her and can't believe that he's in her presence and attract environment, like an elevator really creep. He would go to town. He could. Who would ravage her? Be horrible. I mean now you're much more vulnerable as a woman if you're that super famous. If you think she puts in a writer when she goes to a hotel is like, okay, but you got to let him know, no one can ride with me.

Speaker 3:          00:15:17       No, you can't do that. She might have rules at her security follows security, security. She might have rules like she doesn't want security to let anybody in the hotel lobby with her won't let anybody in the elevator with. I don't know. she might, but it's like people don't have to listen to that normal after that. No one's allowed to be in the elevator with you. Well, here's the thing about like you and I is that we're were standup comedians and by being a stand up comedian, you're all the time forced to look at everything, interrupt you, looked at yourself, you look at yourself, you look at like what you're saying. You look at the world around you, you're looking for jokes and things. You look for jokes and yourself. You look at for jokes in your own life. A lot of people don't do that ever, so they're not thinking ever thinking about their behavior.

Speaker 3:          00:16:05       They just doing what they can get away with and they're acting is fucking loony tunes often as they can get away with it is as they continue to get away with more and more looney tune shit or got worse and worse, but that's what the whole diva thing is all about. Man, I mean, she has so much power to yell and scream at people like, why? Why do you, why is that? What's going on there? I said, rosetta, every year, every year she got, she had our show. There's just fired more show runners. She was on the podcast talking about it. Really? Yeah. it's just like talking to people. When she talked about how crazy she went. Really? Yeah. Yeah. She's pretty open about it, you know? I mean, she's essentially saying what you're saying. She's sAying that nobody can handle it. It's too after another.

Speaker 3:          00:16:46       They all fall. It's too hard to be, but there's no way. No way. There's no way. Yeah. I've been trying to rush people. You're scrawny so young too, you know, for him to be so young and that habit to them, it's fucking wild ride, man. That's not a normal ride of life. You're not a man yet. You're a child and you're adored. That's not supposed to happen that way. You're supposed to feel insecure and see how they become the joffrey. Oh yeah, exactly. Exactly. Exactly. I mean, he's raised in that. I'm sure he's not. I'm sure a lot of it is exaggerated. He seems like a nice kid. I met him once. I shook his hand. Is dancing in the ufc. Yeah, I mean it seems like a nice treat. Trump tremble. what do I know? I didn't know. I didn't know. It wasn't until I was shaking his hand like as I was shaking his hand, I was like, I was saying her kid, this was a while ago, but he's much more famous now than even he was then.

Speaker 3:          00:17:37       Oh, I keys like in some crazy stratosphere of fame thing now, but I think we like jesus. No, no, no, no, no. He was just a nice kid. Just came over and I realized as I was shaking his hand that it was justin bieber, but just said this was like two years ago. Probably two, maybe might even be three, but nice. You know, it's nice as an all well and good, but idiot man. Being able to handle that kind of fame. I couldn't imagine how anybody could not elvis it. Peggy, there's no way. It seems like there's no way. It seems like your, your reality. Just so bizarre.

Speaker 4:          00:18:16       Yeah. If you are just entitled to something, you were just like, alright, I'll take it. Yeah. Do you think they're just picking on him to a point where like, I mean they're like making new stories of him peeing in a mop bucket and they're, they're, they're making new stories of him being a 21 year old egging his neighbor's house. Oh no, no, no, but it iS real. But I mean when I was 21, right. That's what we all did. We all did.

Speaker 3:          00:18:40       But a 21 year old that's got $500,000,000 or whatever it is. God, that becomes more interesting when they get mad at them in a bucket. You got thAt much money. He's got to pee in the house. The egging, the house thing. I kind of disagree. I don't think there's anything wrong with that. Yeah. I don't think there's anything wrong with that being a story. I think that's a real important story.

Speaker 4:          00:19:02       Yeah, I agree. But he got caught, but it's like that is. But like all these other things are just like, well, yeah, you're 19 and slutting it up. Yeah. You're from the south, of course. That's perfect on on target. I bet you if you were hanging out with him, it would be just like hanging out with your friends. Oh, you want to smoke weed? Oh dude, let's get a little faster than the car. Oh, let's do this. And then you have all those things that you've did. they've made stories out of all these little minor details and made it like every time you go on tmz, it's something stupid. Like bieber did this, he flicked off. There was smoke coming out of his

Speaker 3:          00:19:36       carly. He becomes the show. See the problem is like when, when you step out like that and you drive in a chrome car and he's. What he's doing is he's stepping out, he's racing lamborghinis and miami and he's getting fucked up here and he's getting fucked up there and he's having fun. He's having a great time. I bet he's having a great time. he's doing the best I've ever imagined. A 19 year old kid could do with a half a billion dollars. He's doing great. Like leave him alone. His dad's around them all the time. Right. I don't know what story, I'm just trying to make good music, dude. What the fuck should I do? He's having a blast is what has happened. But boy, he's on a crazy rocket ship ride. There's no way he's strapped to the, to the head of like a missile and shot through the sky and it's like, wow. The fucking, you know, the ride fast and very exciting. But the lending, what is the lending going to be like them out like a, like a virgin anymore. Well, how are you going to keep this? I mean, how long are you going to keep balling? how long can you keep balling that hard? It's

Speaker 2:          00:20:48       got a chrome car. He's 19. He's going to throw an exit. Is fucking neighbors house. Shirley temple retired at 21. Whoa. She was like, I'm getting out of the business. living off residuals. Whoa. She lived a normal life. Wow. That's crazy. Yeah, I feel like 10 years. Nobody even fucking bother. Wow. Huh? That might be the move. Just like, cool. I get it now. I'm good. I'm set on this. Let me just, uh, working on my painting. I don't know, man, you know, as, as you see more and more instances of people that get that super stratosphere fame and more and more. Michael jackson's, you know, Michael Jackson to me is the most fascinating character study on human beings that I've ever witnessed because I think he is. He never went down and faint. Well I guess sort of he kind of did it and then didn't.

Speaker 2:          00:21:41       Then we started sort of still in the mix because people didn't want to believe that he was a child molester. Nobody wanted to believe it. Dude, that guy, it became a fucking freak. He became a monster. He became a monster monster. He became a monitor into a monster. He became this white skinned vampire like guy with alien eyes pick nose. He had his. Yeah, he had his eyes worked on to the point where his eyes were like really big and why it was weird. He had a bunch of weird shit done to his face. He had a temple, put it in, play the superbowl, and he denied ever having anything done. Yes, yes, yes. He denied having anything done like went to have my nose fixed, but that was because something went wrong and then he pretended to have a baby with somebody. Yeah. What was that?

Speaker 2:          00:22:31       And the kids came out white with one with one with elvis's daughter to live baby with her. Well, no, no, no. He didn't have a baby with her, but uh, he had with this one woman supposedly she was pregnant with his kids and the kids came out totally white. Totally white. Completely white. Like it's one of the weirdest things ever and I guess you're supposed to do. I don't know what you're supposed to question and believe in him. I don't know the guy. Do you remember when he was going through that? When he's doing the interview in vegas? There's going through that. Like store? Yes. It was like, totally, you know, the famous pretty nice. I'll have to have those plays and this guy behind there's lyric just like, all right, that's $200,000 was $150,000 each. There's a toweling it up. You just keep going.

Speaker 2:          00:23:13       Yeah. Doing the interviewing. Yeah. Ordering shit. Just walKing through, it was kind of like a cry for help, man. Sort of. that video was kind of like a cry for help. What did that kid say? This is that guy that's saying that Michael Jackson molested him when he was a kid and now he's like trying to get money out of this state state saying you waited too long to add, so it's not as funny anymore. It's our money. What do you think though, man? You know, there's also the possibility that he didn't molest kids or he. There's nothing I know about the world that would say that that's a realistic possibility, but yeah, it was. Could it be that people were trYing to take advantage of a guy that's just fucking really weird? Yeah. Maybe that's the only way people aren't like at his door with pitchforks is as a possibility while he's dead it a door today.

Speaker 2:          00:23:59       No, no, no. He died the weirdest death. However. Yeah. the guy who's taking this with me getting put under every night and that's how he's going to send someone to jail. Yeah. Yeah. You imagine humanity, you take it to the next level of sleep, you're getting fms, the tie to yourself to be okay. How about sleeping pills? So that's telling to fit in like a nightmare. Well, uh, I just think if we just let michael, if you just lay your head down, just count sheep for a little bit of. Well that's tells me you're not listening to me. Try it without the stuff. Yeah. He wasn't willing. He wasn't even willing to endure that. Nope. Nope. We're not going to be staying up another night. Ties me and their doctor was so crazy. He just did it. He was getting paid so much fucking every night, but it was, I guess that's super bad for you. I guess you're not supposed to ask.

Speaker 2:          00:25:01       It seems like that would be a no brainer. Like do you sleep? Yeah. So not really. I wake up more refreshed. Moistened had a side effect of that particular type of anesthesia is like, no, no, you, you wake up and you feel refreshed. It's like there's some sort of a trick to it. Oh really? I'll have to like 30 minutes. I kind of remember reading that I should probably pull it up. I think there was a particular type of anesthesia that he was eddie bravo's class. I felt so refreshed afterwards. That's different. Yeah. You wake up and I was like, when he was like, yeah, you can get back in there. I was like, kennedy. Really? I just felt like I felt like rusted. I felt like a nap for 30 minutes. So is anesthesia. Do you guys remember what it was called? What do you mean?

Speaker 2:          00:25:49       the type of game of war? The anesthesia that they got him with a pro bowl fall. Oh yeah. Propafol purple fox who was sort of a pro falls benefits per pole. Fall full joint. Even once I can't go to sleep. What else you got? That's, but I haven't been. We've got to go to the idea that someone could get that far gone to get that far gone where they just need to be put out to other doctors were like, michael, I can't do that. Like get the fuck outta here with dr. Was like, all right, I guess I'll do it. I guess this dr. Thought he was going to be able to keep them alive and if he kept him alive, he would be still pulling money out of michael for a long time. I mean, that's the only reason why it makes any sense that anybody would agree to do this is because need money or they want the money. It's so. I mean, there's a reason why it's not legal. It's not ethical. It's scary. It's scary that you can get a doctor to agree to just put you under every night.

Speaker 2:          00:26:56       It's so crazy. Oh, I'm trying to find the disadvantages. Ended up going to sleep every night. I might buy the gas. Yeah. I'm, I'm just the disadvantages of, uh, of using it. Let me hear him just a. By the way, I'll be in chicago at zanies this weekend. I'm want to want to know more powerful chicago. Zany, small club. Cool place. Yeah. there had been supposed to be one of the best clubs In the country. I've never been in there really good. I was supposed to be one of those small ones, right? Yeah. It's a real small. I think it's like less than 200 seats. I think it's jammed though. I joined three shows on saturday, two shows on sunday. I love it. I love chicago. Chicago's cool. But the best. There's something fantastic about that town. I mean this is a mess right now as far as crimes, especially with young urban kids like the gang warfare, that chicago.

Speaker 2:          00:27:52       Horrible, horrible gang fighting and murders a lot. A lot of that going on. Some pleasant. Yeah. Yeah. There's a lot of that shit going on. It's a, it's kind of one of the highest murder rates in the country. Really? Oh yeah. When I was there, I barely ever played there. He never played there. I barely ever do it with me just to do with the theater fucking might ask you. That was like a week ago. I forgot how it will be. All different material if you'd come out there and I'm not going to appear of that stuff. Um, there is, um, there's a type of person that comes from the midwest. They're like, they're like grounded and you went in the store. Yeah. This is sort of a genuine grounded quality, like a lot of hard work and people, a lot of people that have worked on farms, a lot of people that have families that worked on the farm.

Speaker 2:          00:28:42       People that came over here, their relatives came over here a long ass time ago. You know what I saw there once though I saw it was one of the early days. I went there with you and there was this. They put us into like a vip area, those night clubs and some girl was flirting and then she came in and sat with us. I was like, yeah, sure, come on in, and then as soon as she went in, some girl behind the rope bumped her. She just gave her this look like, excuse me, you need to keep out of here. This isn't my area right now. She just took it over. Was she kicked a girl out of. It was so confused. She just got invited to some vip area that immediately started acting like she was better than everyone else. So the first time I saw that behavior, oh, I see where your shoes. Somehow the queen, all of a sudden, yeah, people can be county. That's not good. I definitely explained that the least. You might be too hard to talk right now. My tolerance went down in New York. My most slow your roll. Yeah. The New York thing is a bummer. Huh?

Speaker 3:          00:29:41       So it's such a horrible way to live. They for folks who don't know. Alright. I mean I'm not saying this like a. This is the way you have to live. I'm just letting you know, in los angeles it is unbelievably ridiculously easy to procure a marijuana just pulled over. it's essentially legal. It's essentially legal. Yeah. Um, if you have a medical license, it's legal. If you have a medical license, if you don't have a medical license, it's decriminalized. So, uh, that's one of the things that arnold did when he left office. So As long as you're not smoking weed and drIving like an asshole, it's, it's pretty fucking legal. You do it, you're doing it in the privacy of your own home. So I'll give a shit. They don't give a shit in my window giving me a lecture about texting with a half smoke bowl, like in the middle, leaning in for like two minutes.

Speaker 3:          00:30:30       They don't care then. Okay. They know what people are concerned with. Especially police officers. There's people that are fucking dangerous. Yes. They're concerned with. If you see a guy texting, that's dangerous. You know if you. If you see a guy in his van looks like cheech and chong, that guy's probably drove really fucking slow. As this smoke leaves is cracked window, that guy is going to be a. He's probably going to be really scared of merge, but other than that in Maryland I couldn't figure out. Even with my friend, we're wanting to smoke pot, but we couldn't do it at each other's parents' house. Just got in the car. No other options, but then you carson. I was like, wait, that's the problem. If you've got to make that choice, you make that choice to smoke in your car. Your car is always going to smell like.

Speaker 3:          00:31:08       Wait, no, just for like 10 minutes. Bullshit shit. Unless you've closed doors right? When you finished smoking pot, smoking dogs come there a month later. He smells like weed, a weed in my car on the way to the airport. This time that was in there, like in the center console for maybe a year or two. I was just. I didn't try it yet. I was on the way to the airport. I always wonder if I know edibles lose their potency. They do. Yeah. They go away. It goes away like almost entirely. It gets to the point where they don't do anything but they only have like a certain time. Mccormick explained it to me once. I don't remember if tony, somebody that was in the back of my fridge for like three years. Once you want it, you can have it and how they and he was like, I'm high as fuck.

Speaker 3:          00:31:51       Wow. Well I guess maybe the dried plants, it's different than when you cook it. It's like the cooking aspect of it I think, or the edible form. Something about like top off too long doesn't really like of what if like let's say you have a thing of like that. The red sauce, not the structural cells, but the ones with all the seeds in them. You ever see those? Oh, okay. Yeah, I know what you're talking about on top off that. Just let it like oxygenate it goes away. No, no. It's just observation. Really? Yeah. Hm. That's interesting. I don't know. You're the one that turned me onto that fucking shit. What is that stuff that you gave me that bombs to bomb. Oh, so good. Oh my god. He gave me this hot sauce that it looks like if you were like, uh, it even has like a nuclear warning sign on it, like a little nuclear sign on it and it's such a small bottle.

Speaker 3:          00:32:50       You're like, what did what, what? How horrific could this stuff possible? It's such a small bottle, like how are they so confident is telling me that much hot sauce. Is it just that one pepper that whatever the ghost pepper pepper. I don't know if it's ghost pepper. It might be that casts become capsaicin. Capsaicin. yeah. Well, let's find out. See the bomb d, the habanero peppers. That's it. No, that's not it. That's a different one. There's a death one, the black one. There's this little tiny death one, whatever. The little tiny death one is that one to finally answer. What is that? Is it bob dropping in the middle of zed it, but literally three drops a plate of spaghetti and marinara sauce. Three drops. Then mix up the whole thing. Is that the same sauce? It looks different. I guess they have a bunch of different flavors.

Speaker 3:          00:33:44       That's what it was. A few different flavors. Okay. This is it that the bomb beyond insanity. That's it. This is the one. See this one right here? Yeah, that's it. Yeah. Well, whatever. Whatever the fuck. The name of this stuff is. I got cockY and really? Yeah. Yeah. I put like a half a teaspoon of that shit in and I, uh, I took your suggestions. I think it was. No, it was either spaghetti or it was a chicken noodle soup from jerry's famous deli. My suggestion, what a. Doubled it. I took your suggestion and put it into spaghetti. You told him. Forget it. When I put it in noodles, I'm actually, I'm pretty sure that it was the chicken noodle soup because I get that all the time. Um, but holy fuck, I was in agony. I was like, this is the most ridiculous hot sauce of all time.

Speaker 3:          00:34:31       It's got a good flavor to it though. It does. But it was. I went to war. I went to war with wet body, shit it out. It says habanero pepper enhanced with habanero infused flavor. Create a sauce measured at 100, 19,700 scoville units of heat. Wow. That's a jalapeno pepper is $2,500. That is insane. One hundred 19,700 scoville units. So a lot. I didn't say anything on a plate of spaghetti. I took like a whole team one bite, fought on the ground for awhile. Thump the whole thing back into the whole tub of spaghetti. And then all that was hot. I didn't think that it was. Um, I didn't think it was just to narrow. It seems so strong. I felt like it had to be more than when they're really good. Really good habanero sauce. And you know, real strong stuff, but it was nothing like that.

Speaker 3:          00:35:28       That was so good. Do you ever have liu kotecha? That's my griddle. That's my shit. The mexicans know how to make the best hot sauce period. Dude there habanero sauce that you could tuck. It's delicious. It's hot. But it's also really delicious. Like I put a lot of that shit in my eggs and it's got a lot of heat, but it's still so the taste is so good. You get a lot of people don't understand that. It's a lot about the taste, the taste. It's a pain, but it goes with the good taste. Yeah. You don't sound like an asshole. I love. Do you ever get challenged where you put a bunch of hot sauce and someone will be like, drink this whole thing. then during this whole thing of tabasco in, you're like, I'm not trying to win it challenged. Why come on? It's like your dad, if he catches you smoking a cigarette, once you smoke the whole pack, bitches want to try cigarettes. YoU have to fucking stuffing my face with a little pack. You're about cvs. What apple was cvs, oh, they're not going to sell cigarettes and not going to sell tobacco products. Weird

Speaker 5:          00:36:25       did it anyway. We had a sell out and they sell alcohol and it's supposed to be a place to get medicine. For the longest time I was blaming all of these Philip Morris like, oh, they know it's addictive. There's still fucking putting it out there. But then you're like, well, what about the people selling it? They know to the stacks. They're just making money off it. They could easily do with the cbs is doing

Speaker 3:          00:36:44       so weird. Especially pharmacies. Well, it's weird man, because there's part of me that says, hey, I want to be able to buy cigarettes. If I was an idiot, if I was an idiot and I decided to start smoking cigarettes, I'd want to be able to buy them. I don't give a fuck if cvs cells, um, you know, wants to keep selling them again, if you don't want make it, um, illegal. But some health place does not have to sell but fucking agents of death, that is kinda creepy that it's a cvs and think about it that way.

Speaker 5:          00:37:10       They have a tequila, they end the alcohol and then they have medicine on the next side. Just makes no. I mentioned on twitter and all these people like, oh, they still sell candy. They still do this. My gosh, it's a good thing. It gives people less like direct access, easy access to a harmful product. Yeah. This is good. It's almost like, well, they're just going to get all this, all this business from the um, uh, insurance companies now. And it's like, yeah, they should, they should get rewarded that reward when you do good thing. It's nice when those people get rewarded. It's not, doesn't make it bad.

Speaker 3:          00:37:38       The idea that you could just sell things that you know are going to kill, they're not held liable. I mean, it's not even something that gets you. There's something about, there's a willingness when you decide you're going to drink, you know, like when you, like when if we're at a comedy club, like you want to do shots, shots, there's this thing that happens when you decide that you're going to drink that is beneficial. There's some, there's camaraderie in it, there's like fun. And you know, there's, there's happiness to it, there's a warmth if you're doing it right, you know, you can enjoy the experience of having a couple of drinks. But the experience of smoking cigarettes is just death. I mean that's all it is. Nice when you're getting a good circle of people. Yeah. but it's not changing your, your fucking state. I mean, it might be giving you a little bit of a stimulation, right? It gives you a stimulant sort of affect. Right? Yeah. That's interesting. Friendly

Speaker 5:          00:38:31       thing. That's what hurt me the most is not smoke when you see like phrase. So like just in a circle dissolve.

Speaker 4:          00:38:36       I'm like, I want to be part of that. Right, right. Yeah. There's a thing that people do, like people like did that with cigars, that I sit around cigars and smoke with a bunch of guys now it's really weird because all the comics are using these things. So you see circles of people using these fake electronic who goes,

Speaker 3:          00:38:50       well, those are better than. Those are fucking better for you. That shit is better for you than cigarettes,

Speaker 4:          00:38:55       period. This is great for me for like for chain smoking or when I'm inside, it's like chainsmokers thing I would do. I wouldn't even think about it be like working and I'd be smoking, put it out. I'm like, wait, where's my. oh, I already put out like I'm, you know what I mean? So that's good for like the inbetweens and when I'm driving and traffic has been like a two pack a day smoker for years and years when he's already telling about 120 days. The. yeah. The good thing about that help people quit. The good thing about this is besides like the blue cigarettes and like those little disposable nicotine ones, those like you have, you don't get any kind of satisfaction from, oh really? In this?

Speaker 3:          00:39:29       That one looks too much though. It looks too big. Like all attention to yourself, the whole device. It's a bunch of smoke. that's topics not even straight on. No, no you, it, it's just too much attention. It's just too big. Why is it too much attention? Because it's god. It's like, look at this thing I'm doing, I'm doing something different. Everyone look, is that what it is or is it, is there any, um, the ones that look the same size as, as I get that. AlrIght. Gluten goes off. You mean like a oil in their eggs? Yeah, the blue six. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:40:02       Differences. This battery lasts a long time and has a lot of juice in it. It looks like an electric toothbrush. Yeah,

Speaker 3:          00:40:11       it looks like when those things that they, uh, they put in your ear to look around. Oh yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:40:15       Read out. Also it tells you your temperature and it also tells you how many hits you've had. And it also says like, what your battery life. that is a true. Let me see that thing. And what's really cool is that they had these bars now in los angeles that are huge bars, mixology bars. So you go in, you're like, yeah, I want cotton candy, but pez and they'll go, okay. And then some of those. Yeah. And it's like these, it's almost going to a bar.

Speaker 3:          00:40:37       Okay. All right. You're, you're wrong. Was this thing's dope? I do wear a fanny packs. We really selling higher primate. Got a beautiful one for boots, higher primate logo on it with boots, roots, you know, roots the company that makes bags and make leather bags. Yeah. They made me one with a higher primate logo on it. I got it from dice. Dice came in and he had a. He had sweatpants on and these, this fanny pack and I'll go, that's a beautiful fanny pack. I'm like, where'd you get those? The goal? Yeah, it's from root. It's the best. And he showed me the fatty, so I got them. I got the dice. Clay, a fanny pack that my. My family, my fanny pack is a dice clay inspired. I've just ordered some sweatpants online. I'm waiting to get them and I'm just going to start wearing sweatpants.

Speaker 3:          00:41:24       I know I'm going to wear track suits. No, no, he's not. I agree with this. They are comfortable and not worried about that. Look, they have this new sweatpants. Do that look like pants. Have you seen these things go out like that. That's ridiculous. Could not go into pants. You got to wear sweatpants. You know that's you're full. You can't put fucking racing stripes on a cadillac. That's just stupid. that's dumb. If you get. What are you going to wear? Sweat pants. Their sweatpants. Make them look like sweater and have a crease in it makes it look like a tuxedo. I'm going to start wearing tracksuits. Please don't do that. I cannot sit with you. If you do that, you can. You'll be fine. these are fine. I supported you through your cardigan days. Never sAid a word. I never shit on your fucking terrible dress habits.

Speaker 3:          00:42:09       I never did. How dare you say that? You wouldn't support me for athletic wear. That's just drooling. Athletics. I can see it. I'm an athletic guy. I like to move around. It was breakout close. It don't hold me down. Cds or sweatpants, but they look like regular pants. Oh, that's nice. I would wear those. I'd wear those. Yeah. I actually would love to wear those. That's actually. It seems like something that I was like, sweatpants you're looking at right as cock aren't. You can't help it. I looked at it, I looked at it for a full three or four seconds, joe, and he's going to be wearing cookie monster sweater. That's me. Beautiful and be covered with cat hair. Show you how much of a beta I am. I'm all for the tracksuits. I think that needs to make a comeback because I hate wearing jews were so concerned with what

Speaker 1:          00:42:57       kind of clothes we wear, but people who were like really into style, they're always annoying. Always annoying when they start talking to you about, this is a, this is gucci, this is and this is a. This is a ralph lower end. This artist's prints on with all. There's all these older artists, others get a little successful and they have like sleeves, but they're like, oh, I only wear these types of shoes. Being into clothes, there's nothing wrong with enjoying. I think are closer artwork though, don't get me wrong, but this people that are like really like obsessive really into style and kind of snobbish about it. That's like a weird thing to give a fuck about. You give a fuck that this guy has paint on his pants, like if you and I are hanging out and you have pain on your pants, I could give zero fucks.

Speaker 1:          00:43:40       Is that like a better thing? Whatever. You know. I'm just saying if you choose to wear type of shoe, were you choose to where I can make fun of portland. You can wear anything you want to wear anything you want everywhere, but someone who's like into like rigid style. Oh, that's out of style. That's how style says. Fucking who fucking who. You tell me what the hell board decides what's in style and not installed where? Whatever the fuck you want. If you want to wear some sweatpants, where's fucking sweatpants and anyone who cares is an idiot you. You can look that guy's walking around in sweatpants and why you give a fuck. Why would anybody care even slightly? If someone's walking around wearing sweatpants in the office, in the, in the board room, what do you give a fuck? What you have to wear? That weird stupid outfit that you wear with these stiff

Speaker 2:          00:44:32       corners, these sharp edges and a tie around your neck, enough and cuff links that are so fucking stupid. You have to stick some metal, extraneous pieces in there and tighten up the links because your scholar folds over. Get the fuck out of here. That's what we are. Shiny, stupid, hard, soled shoes. What do you have wood in your shoe? Bottom of your shoe is would really. There's wouldn't your shoe. What is it? Fucking 18. 12. Are you living in Denmark? You have clogs on you. Fuckhead. Ridiculous. Why would you have leather? Shiny leather on the bottom of your toes? They all slippery and stupid. That is government at all. What's with the tassels? You fucking halfway. You like tassels and the funnIer shoes. Idiot man. What is that? Extra fancy fucking leather. The leather tassel and silly and ancient and dum de dum, de dum. Who cares how you dress? You know I just saw several long in New York. I would put on flip flops, shorts, no shirt. Just get high and walk around it. Is that cool to walk around with no shirt? No, it's not. No. I mean it's allowed, but people go through it, but it's not illegal.

Speaker 2:          00:45:52       What about women then? Can women walk around topless? I know that's been fought for right? In columbus, Ohio. you can portland. it can be. You can be topless. Yeah. These tassels. Yeah. Oh my god, man. It's tasks on top of tassels. You need iowasca. If you were tassels and issues you need iowasca like that take you away. Have you ever done that stuff?

Speaker 1:          00:46:22       Iowasca still have not either. It's a more prolonged version of a dmt trip that apparently doesn't quite get to that dmt flash level really, but it gives you sort of this weird spiritual insight thing that you don't necessarily get with dmt. That's the way it's been described to me by my friends who have done it. It's hard like when you try to relate experiences, everybody's is very different, so like if you haven't personally experienced it, it's hard to put into context what they're saying. Like how They're describing something. Yeah. We don't have to put into words, so one of these days I'll have to do it, but um, the dmt flash, everybody that I've talked to where I've tried to piece together what they say about their experiences, it's all seems like we're all talkinG about a similar place, but it's hard to. It's so wacky that it's hard to put into like any context on, in the real world.

Speaker 1:          00:47:23       so the words that you use are all the wrong words as they're talking about talking about god and the voice of god. He has no voice. It's something like is no arm of god is there's nothing that we can comprehend if this is, if it isn't, you know, when you, when you do that, if it isn't, you actually communicating with something. If it's all happening inside your head and it's all imaginary. God damn your brain has some untapped potential. Oh yeah. Probably if that's in there, if that really is just our collective minds in there or really is just the, the, the, the, the depth of the potential of human thought and your ability to hallucinate or imagined things are your imagination in itself, the very mechanics of your imagination, creating all these crazy illusions and if that is the case, like, wow, you know what an incredible potential the human mind has just on its own that just we get to every now and again and it puts on this bizarre show of this, this godlike quality like this, this perfect, idealistic, utopian, loving thought process.

Speaker 1:          00:48:25       The hits you when you're on that stuff like of course people think it's god. I mean maybe it is god and maybe what god is is human potential. It's greatest heights. This is what god really is. Just a concept and maybe we're just getting too much of it. When you have a psychedelic experience, it's too much. Whatever the fuck you know that you're tapping into. That gives. I've seen it once, but I've never done it. I watched them on. No, the other stuff. The empty, empty. Yeah. Well, I'm sure we can make that happen. If you were willing to sign a few pieces of paper for the government to participate in this study, you should get in on the rick strassman studies. What's the. He's doing it again. What to do. He's the guy that wrote that book, dmt the spirit molecule. He was the first guy that was able to, um, secure federal research.

Speaker 1:          00:49:18       Yeah. He's got a license to be able to do it. I don't know if they funded it. They allowed him to do it, but they allowed him to do intravenous dmt. A injection. Some chippiness. Yeah. The book's called dmt, the spirit molecule. And it's a fantastic book. It's really interesting. He's a, he's a scientist and he's a strassman and say I would donate my Body to science. He's a brilliant, brilliant guy, but he's also like a really cool guy. And uh, he's, he's really nice. He's a really nice persOn. And when you hear about his, a relaying of these people's experiences, the way he set everything up and his, his willingness to track this idea down and try to see what it really is all about is really courageous. You know, for a doctor to do that, you can get in some weird. We can some weird situations where people think you're a kook, But he's dealing with a real chemical so they can't get funding to study mushrooms for the low.

Speaker 1:          00:50:10       The maps is starting to break some boundaries on that and they're starting to, uh, to make some headway really, you know? Yeah. There was a John Hopkins university study and psilocybin maps is the something, multiple disciplinary psychedelic studies. I don't know what the actual acronym, how it works, but it's probably the number one group as far as like really intelligently debating and promoting psychedelics and the study of psychedelics. All brilliant, brilliant guys. You know, we had rick doblin, who's one of the guys from maps, one of the head guys. We had them on the podcast and the guy couldn't have been cooler. I told him I suburban friends that take mushrooms. She didn't. She's about to turn 40 well burbs. She was like, oh no. We're just like, yeah, that sounds like do it through with your husband. Tell to take mushrooms and listened to that use youtube song. Actually watch it, watch it. And when you can video the one fallon from fallon.

Speaker 2:          00:51:05       Oh yeah, yeah. Do you think when you get through a certain age though that it might be too scary to recommend somebody, you, you don't have herpes and she said I'll be scared. I'm like, yeah, of course you'll be scared. Yeah. But I mean like when you get to a certain age, it kind of also have that like I'm going to die. No, it's a big hit. What kind of flavor? This great mix of a little bit of a fucking child. Pina colada. You're a black child. I didn't get anything. Yeah, you have to hold the button the whole time. You kinda, you can kinda like, like puff on it almost. That's kind of the way to do it. Best puffing on it. How'd you get the desk while symbol in their sticker fit. Perfect. Oh my gosh. That's hilarious. But you know, like when you're older you kind of have like in the back of your head like, oh, you know what if I'm having a heart attack because I'm 40, you know, like, because I want to recommend it to somebody that's never done it the same way. But I told them, I'm like, that's ridiculous notion. She's never done anything like that. But yeah, totally.

Speaker 1:          00:52:04       You should let people do what they want to do. If they want to live their whole life and never do mushrooms, you should let them.

Speaker 2:          00:52:09       I'm not going to force them to do it. She didn't even bring it up. I shouldn't even bring it up. Oh no. Disagree. Absolutely. Bring it up. You think you should offer it up? Oh really? Yeah. Well I think if you want to fuck her, you should know. Even if I don't, I did advise my male friends to try to get them to do it. Do you really? Yeah. Yeah. I'm with me though. I wonder if I'm gonna try to fuck girls to mushrooms with them. Really weird. You freak out in front of her. You ruined. I can't. So they don't feel like, like held down? No, no way. That's awesome.

Speaker 1:          00:52:46       Yeah. I think, uh, anything you do, whether it's mushrooms or smoked pot. I was having a conversation with a buddy of mine last night about a friend of ours and we were talking about like how this dude could benefit from weed. This is why he does this because he doesn't smoke smoke pot. So he's not, he's not, he doesn't have that paranoid introspective thing that you get when you smoke weed. We start really examining yourself. Uncomfortable lights people. A lot of people don't smoke weed who need to lead the quality they're lacking. So they have like this hubris thinking, oh, they keep pushing forward without considering how they come off to other people. They just pushing forward.

Speaker 3:          00:53:26       And this is hubris that will like, come on man, just smoke doesn't stop and think about it for a second. People get caught up. Also, you get caught up and going in a certain direction. Like, like did you see wolf of wall street? No. No, a good. Yeah, it's good. Yeah. I really enjoyed it. It's really good. You know, a lot of people say that martin scorsese, like his movies are kind of like formulaic. Yeah. But I say those people can go fuck themselves because uh, what he does is he wrote a column. He knows how to do it, man, I should've. I'm sorry. So good with words for my next 1500 words that I don't need. Here's a picture. Boom. He just knows how to make a movie that like, it's different. Like he'll do things like, like there's a part when leonardo dicaprio, like, you know, everyone's moving and talking and they just stopped talking, but there, there's no sound coming out.

Speaker 3:          00:54:19       But he's walking towards the camera and looking at you essentially completely cut out the sound of all the other people and he's talking to you. It's like these weird little things that he does, like this is the chaos of the trading room floor. And as leonardo dicaprio walkthrough through it, it's, there's no sound. Just him talking. He's explaining his life. The world shifted. The record goes saying something about something. He's just dope. He's just dope. Martin scorsese, he's just a master. He's just, he had his shot and I'm a taxi driver where it's when you see a guy walking towards the camera, a character walk towards the camera, and then you'd see another angle like cut right from there to cameron moving towards something and you're like, that's the point of view of the guy we just saw. Right. Um, so then he started having a pan across that view starts panning across the taxi place all the way around and around, and then it's that it puts the deniro in the shot was supposed to be his point of view and all of a sudden he's in it.

Speaker 3:          00:55:12       He just does stuff like that. This shooting is just as craZy as this character is. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. You, that deeper shit gets you feeling loopy. Yeah. There's just a, this such an art to filmmaking. No, I don't have any desire to ever do it, but it seems like a lot of work. Oh my god. It seems like so much work, but I appreciate the shit out of it. You know, I really, really appreciate someone who's really good at it. Someone who just really knows how to make a movie that you go to see go fucking a as a good guy. American hustle is a good guy. That's pretty good. That's a good fucking movie, man. That is a good fucking movie man. Christian hail is such a bad mother fucker and he's pretty good at either. Damn. He's good. Yeah. Do you ever see the machinist and those women were fuckinG fantastic to the chick from the hunger games? Oh yeah. God damn fantastic. Prior what? I'm moving. bradley cooper was awesome. You haven't seen it yet. I don't see movies unless I have a girlfriend. I just never think about what you mean ladies. You hear that cry for help. Don't let another seAson go by without, without brian red band. FInding a girlfriend. I live a totally different

Speaker 2:          00:56:23       life. When I'm in a relationship like a relationship, I don't do shit. I don't watch tv. I don't want you to movies. What do you do? Play with dogs. You just don't do anything. Furious. Masturbation from the jump. Alarm clock goes off and we begin the race. That's how many times you can masturbate in the day. What do you. You get to? Probably like three or four guys know you could do more than that. A day started right away. About five or six. For me, I'd say you get this, you can get to seven to 10 I think, but by the end, what the fuck is kind of madness? It's mostly just liquid. I wouldn't be afraid of that madness filling my head with seeds. What do you mean like back off? Seven times in a day with the things that I need to think of in order to come after times five and six, what are the madness? The fucking craZy savage jeans that I have to tap into my last load off or slow to give yourself more room. I don't want those. I like smelling your wife's pillow. I don't want those thoughts that are already up from there. I don't want those thoughts. I don't want. I don't want to hit comma number seven. That's that's, that's the person, but you have to keep going. I don't like that person fucking figured out that I kind of thinking about dead cats.

Speaker 2:          00:57:49       You go from It being central to being a violent release of soldiers. That's how you orgasm. Thinking a bunch of angry release of demon soldiers flying out of your take on this boner pills make me masturbate a lot more. Really strike out. And then you're like, oh, well know they just last week with his bone and asked for like 24 to 48 hours. Looked up like what happened? Take that stuff a lot. Nope. You never even looked into it. I want propecia postcard, whatever it was. I read a bunch of side effects and it was like depression, all stuff that maybe. I don't know. I think maybe it's stuff was caused by that.

Speaker 1:          00:58:35       I think a hair shit. Yeah. I had a bad reaction to that stuff. It killed my bone on bone arthritis in there too. Killed my boners and it also made me, um, uh, it made me more tired when I would work out. I didn't have as much endurance when I got off of it. My boners came back with a vengeance and it felt like I had more energy training and I was like, man, I wonder if that's affecting me in an extreme way. Like everybody has like a different stages. The way it processes a testosterone to dihydrotestosterone see that everybody has a different bodies reaction. So weird. You know, like some people are allergic to certain types of antibiotics or they're allergic to penicillin or they're allergic to, you know, people get weird rolls of the. With your bodies is. It might be that my body didn't react to it very well, but I know a, I have a buddy who's on it.

Speaker 1:          00:59:27       There's no problems with it at all. He's been taking that shit for like 10 years. Most people don't. Yeah. For me it was a problem, but I didn't realiZe it was a problem until after I stopped taking it. When it stopped, like I ran out of it and all suddenly take was like woken up from a coma to go in bold. Hello? Hello? You. Your head was. You look great when you shaved your head. Oh, I didn't go. I did not like the shape that you don't have to, but I'm telling you, you look great with a shaved head or going to have shaved heads in five years. There's a reason why the monks did it. It's and I don't give a fuck move. I mean I was, for me, it was a matter of aesthetics. My hair was getting so gross. It was got down to the point where like, you shouldn't keep getting haircuts if every time you get your haircut, your hair still looks like shit.

Speaker 1:          01:00:13       WhaT am I paying your shop all this shit off. But I would have done now that diet now that I've done, I would have done a long ass time ago. It's the easiest way to deal with it. Like you've got a round head. Yeah, it works. Good head for, for being bald, but getting your hair cut is so annoying. Having to schedule that time out of your day and sit down and listen to some nonsense. I had a cool hairdresser for a long time, my friend gabrielle up, so she was a hairdresser from the news radio days, but yeah, she's really cool. Cool italian lady from New York, so we've been friends for a long time, so I used to actually enjoy. She probably kept me from cutting my hair off for a long time just because I enjoyed hanging out with her. Go to see her like once a month. They're the coolest ones, man. On a shoot. That the wardrobe stylist. A wardrobe, a hairstylist. So the only. She's funny. She's a funny New York, like a hard ass, a cool lady.

Speaker 4:          01:01:05       The makeup people always hate me because of your ego because you always had that rule of like I never put makeup on like on tv shows and stuff and so that twice I've had to say, no, no, no makeup. I don't do that. They're like, what are you talking about? You have to know.

Speaker 1:          01:01:17       You don't have to try to get me. The other day when I was doing fox sports one, I go, nope guy, we're just going to put a little powder. I'm like, yeah, that's all right though. This is what I look like. This is exactly what it looked like. pretended look different than I looked this crazy. Like get a smooth my skin out. What are you going to do? I let them do what they want to get a light. Me funny and soft. Like I'm an angel. What are you going to do it? They'll fucking do up lighting. This is look man. No one's perfect. This is what I look like. What do you look like? High fucking relax. You don't have to put makeup on people.

Speaker 4:          01:01:48       She got mad. She got upset. Like, look, this is mY job. If you don't get makeup doesn't stop hiring.

Speaker 1:          01:01:52       You know what? People are stIll gonna want makeup. So there's nothing wrong with makeup. I wore makeup everyday when I was on newsradio. Yeah. they'd been make every type we filmed. They put makeup on me. They just want to do and I couldn't say no. Then you know who was there anything I did to be a dick. I was just totally replaceable. I was totally replaceable. I wasn't nobody on that show replay actually replaced the guy who replaced ray romano. So they took. Armando was booked for the pilot, but they didn't shoot the pilot with ray romano. No. This is what happened. Ray romano was booked for the pilot and he was working, but they decided somewhere in the middle of race thing. I don't know if they weren't happy with him or they decided to go a different way with the character and he was originally the last minute like we got to switch.

Speaker 1:          01:02:40       Um, you, you're beginning when they're coming up with ideas and it's throwing the ideas around for a pilot. It's not uncommon for them to change a character. They liked, decide they need a different dynamic. They have all these different dynamics and ray was more of a laid back sort of a dynamic. That's who he is, you know where I'm going to see him on the show, you know, he's like a laid back sort of a guy and I think they wanted someone who was a little aggressive. So when, who was an idiot who's Like, I'm a male idiot, that was going to do aggressive stupid shit. That leaves room for funny. So I got lucky. I came along after ray was replaced by another guy who just fill it in for the guy. He was in the pilot. The other guy was in the pilot.

Speaker 1:          01:03:18       He didn't think he had a job full time job. I don't know what he thought. I don't know. I don't know if the car. Yeah, maybe if he was really good they would have kept him or maybe if he was what they were looking for, they would have kept him. So then they did. Um, did he knows. The funny thing about the audition is that the first stuff that they wrote, it was, it was really interesting because um, it wasn't that funny. It was like more like matter of factly or was more like setting up a character. It was like there was no jokes in them were very subtle. It was like a, uh, a behavior sort of a piece and a lot of guys like totally like tried to overdo it and try to make it like really funny. It just wasn't really funny.

Speaker 1:          01:04:00       And they were saying they did that. The writers did that because they wanted to make sure that no one would try to ham it up. Whoa. Really? Like if it's funny, it's funny, you know, like say it to make it funny like you know how to say it to make it funny or not, but if it's not funny, don't pretend it is. You can't have everything. Doesn't have to be a joke. Like some things and not a joke and some things are a joke just because you're creating a character like that, you know, that character. So when the character does like typical things like that, that character would, it was like a joke of recognition. Right. You know, so then the second time I came in for the second one on the ground near bears, his feet always go pick her up. Yeah. I wouldn't call it, I'll just pick it up, put it in my pocket, let him go like, oh my god, I just.

Speaker 1:          01:04:40       Well you guys have like routines. You go to things. Yeah. Based on what you know already. But at the second time I went in for the audition, they wrote something really funny that was like, whoa, this is hilarious. It was really good stuff. So then they had narrowed it down to a group of people that they thought were not going to ham it up. And then they gave the smallest group to the remaining groups shit to be funny with. Oh, right. So they were super. I don't know, I don't know those guys. Oh, there's just a couple of guys. But I remember things I there. Uh, there's one thing that gives you confidence. It's to see other people falling apart. Subtests who's just fall apart. One of the guy who was auditioning, one of the guys who is waiting to audition, who's totally fall apart or is visibly sweaty, like he was sweaty, like it was sweat was dripping down his head really going over the lines in this like really weird, like a frantic way.

Speaker 1:          01:05:41       Like he was like kind of mouthing the lines while you're sitting there. But it was like, it was like he was falling apart. He was like, no shit. Fuck. Yeah, yeah, yeah. There was something he was doing that gave me massive confidence and I remember thinking, oh, if I just got an audition with this guy, is gonna fall apart, one down, I guess you know, it's probably one of those guys that had been in hollywood like, look, when you're coming out here and you try and audition for shows, it's totally a crapshoot. You could get super lucky on the very first show you get cast and all of a sudden you're on television show. It probably helps that you don't know if it's earlier where you don't really know the stakes. Yeah, maybe it does, but it also helps if you just get lucky and you are what they're looking for, but you could also be here for 20 years and never get cast and shit. That's. That's possible. Especially if you have the wrong look or the wrong, you know, whatever you do always used to say everybody in this town through others, ones away from being a bigger star. Yup. Three auditions away. Yeah. Everybody, every single person. I mean, look, there's some fucking really untalented people on television right now that are stars, stars of reality shows. I mean really untalented people. Are you really gonna chew into the microphone. You motherfucker.

Speaker 4:          01:06:52       Rosanna is out here for what? A week or gay and she got passed at the comedy store and then she got a tv show like quickly thereafter. Was it? Yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:07:01       she had a craZy ride. She was in denver. She started out in denver. Oh yeah. She got really good in denver a for now. By the time she came. Well, you know what man, there's a, there's a kind of an attitude that a denver people have. There's like they're friendly folks, but you know, there's a, there's a hard edge to that place. I mean they're in the rocky mountains. They have bears and shit there, you know, it's like, it's a crazy place to live. Could be living in colorado's a little nutty. So they tolerate a little more like hardy. Yes. You know what I mean? And so rosanne like coming out of there and then going to the comedy store is like, she had already built up this app in this cool, smart, hard edge town in denver is people dealing with the fucking elements every day. And then from there she's in la and there's no comics like her, you know, she's, she's talked be housewife killing to ken lang. It's probably hard to follow. Oh, you could never follow where, man. Do you remember people that have a. I mean, dude, if folks who weren't alive when roseanne barr first hit, she's like her voice ignored rate. But then I gave it another shot and few years later I was like, oh, this show's pretty good. She's a great comic. Yes.

Speaker 3:          01:08:16       Yeah. Especially back in the day, you know, especially when she, when she first made it, she to me is one of the most influential comedians ever. Really? Yup. Because for women that had never been a woman like her before, she's the kinison version of a woman. Never been a woman like that before. She actually had 30 minutes. So I don't know, man. She did more than one special. I mean, she didn't maintain that level of stand up, you know, once she became super famous and the tv show of the attitude of like, no, this is why I'm not trying to be anything. She was bad ass dude. When she was before she got her television show and she was just doing stand up. She was bad ass. There was no women like her before. She was a total new thing. She was an overweight white woman who didn't give a fuck, didn't give a fuck.

Speaker 3:          01:08:58       And she had kids and she didn't give a fuck. You mitZi of black rose dead rose. That's a message. I don't know. Massive following each other. Roses are the rarest of all risks. Mmm. Like roses. Well, it's a nice thing to send then, unless it's voodoo attached. Oh, maybe it is. My notes from footie. WhaT? Roseanne believes. A lot of wacky shit. She's out there sometimes. Oh dude, she's so out there. She's like, she won't touch. It's one of those really very rarely will touch with. Oh, well congrats. You're fucking. I feel pretty good about it. Don't get mad at me, bro. I didn't meet her. she wouldn't shake my hand. He introduced me to her in the fucking office building one on this street. Wow. That's sad. I'm sorry. Sorry. I was just thinking like that's not acceptable to say I don't shake hands.

Speaker 3:          01:09:49       Just don't do that. Well, what about people that are like crazy a add and worried about what diseases with enough famous, excessive compulsive. They just die. I don't know man. I mean you can't do that at the plant, right? You can't. No one's going to accept that. Everybody's in the flintstones. Fucking. I don't shake hands. What? No way. Yeah. Why? Why is that allowed? Right? Why it has to be like it's a movie. A thing. Yeah. It's a fame thing. Our cues. Well, I think we're, I was saying, I think we're uniquely fortunate in being stand up comedians that you were forced to look at ourselves all the time and I think if you want to think about someone who gets pushed into these weird boxes of, of power, you the power, that sort of unnatural, you know, power that really doesn't exist anywhere in the, in the, the, the natural world where someone is like more famous than other people.

Speaker 3:          01:10:51       So everyone around them is terrified of them. And so they, what they do is they just have these situations where they have a show and throw soda at the fucking guy who was running the show or they were talking about like one of those, um, grace under fire. BreN butler apparently threw him in the face of the dude who was doing grace under fire. Really? Yeah. Yeah. He had like fuckiNg swore at him and said some nasty shit to them. And then they canceled the show. Oh yeah. She was like, I'm too big for this total unnatural behavior to have this one person like brett butler, repercussions and without thinking about yourself all the time, without examining it must be a weird, weird. What is his hecklers? Seventy five percent of hecklers are cute women. CuTe too. Above women trying to get some. Try to get some arch feared, dig.

Speaker 3:          01:11:47       No, just trying to like. They've never been told to shut up because they're too pretty. There's a little of that. There's a little consultant you don't know that like this has nothing to do with you. Be quiet while people get confused and think that because you're talking, they should be able to talk to ya. Waiting, man. Yes. Can't talk. Can't just be talking now. Now, now, now, now I don't agree with them. I'm going to saY something. I'm going to say something. No, iT's not cool. Not calgary. I had her. She wrote letters to every one of the clubs. I was booked out for the next 15 weeks saying what a horrible person I am and how she didn't do anything for being horrible. she was talking all through the first guy and then I started. I was like, stop, stop. I saw you talking about 30 straight minutes.

Speaker 3:          01:12:31       You've got to be quiet. You're just not gonna. We're not gonna do that. And then theY were like, all right. They did one more thing. I told them to be quiet again and then I heard it go next subject and I was like, get out. Just go get out of here front seats. We got. We got an extra ones. I just had to do throughout my first person. I found your place to the other day for same thing. The girl talking the whole time, that boyfriend would not shut her up to the boyfriend's. I'll just shut her up. She just happened to be shadow girl up. You either ask her to be quiet or you asked her to leave with you or you leave her there. Her up man. That shit never works. Especially like a really mouthy woman was really like, that's what she likes to do.

Speaker 3:          01:13:11       People like some people like hold back all week long and they liked to get drunk and fight. Get crazy. Get fucking aggressive. It ruined my whole entire set because she was just fucking sitting there the whole time and I'm just like, alright, couldn't take it anymore. It happens all the time. Yeah, it's weird, you know, it's the enemy oF comedy sometimes, but then sometimes it's fucking hilarious. Sometimes it turns out to be something funny. You know? We also have the advantage that we were comedy store comics and there was no crowd control. None. Zero. We like people would say like, I would do like a show and some of the hackle and it will go so well. People would say. Was that planned? Like, was that guy a plant? Like, no. Where'd you come up with all that stuff? Like when you, when you started out at the comedy store, you go to war. Not only is it not police, even when you come off and it's been a horrible heckler the whole time. No one that goes to the door, guy goes, oh, you should throw somebody out there. Just moan about it in the back to themselves. Yeah. And then the next idea after that deals with it and nobody says something. Yeah, it's hilarious. Have a to that place

Speaker 1:          01:14:12       was the worst. I alwaYs thought that people were. You throw him out if he was talking to the mayor, but not for me. There's also an extra douchey ness to that place because it's in hollywood. It's a famous iconic building, so you would get these people that were like, there's an extra level of douche that you get from people that are like in show business that are [inaudible] are trying to make it in show business. There's a lot of people that give attempts at show business and they're really insane and it doesn't go well for them and so they'll, they'll be at a comedy club and they'll see someone doing something and they decide and they're insane, have so good. Not only that, this guy ain't shit and I'm better than him. I can be funnier than him. Like I've heard people. It was like, you're a mattress salesman.

Speaker 1:          01:14:57       You don't do that anymore. I've heard people that could be in a comic or it could be an actor in their mind, but it's just this extra duty genus of people that are out here. You know what I mean? It's like it's not an unchecked juiciness that you don't find that often in the east coast. The different kinds of duchamp's yeah. Unchecked. What the fuck is wrong with you? Yeah. Nobody like, they don't have friends that don't have people to go shut the fuck up in boston though. It was different kind of drunk. If it's out of control, just savages that they're there. They're just like that. I've blocked out already to the descendants of wild savages that came with here on boats before there were movies. We just stop and think about that. They didn't know what the fuck was over here. These people were craZy.

Speaker 1:          01:15:36       The genetics of the first irish that came to America, but maniacs who the boats or fuck with that. Hey, we're thinking about going on a boat to a place that we can't really describe because any photos or anything because they haven't invented cameras yet, but it will take a few months. We're going to take a few months and hopefully we will die of starvation. And uh, by the time we get there, I mean, hopefully the savages one eat your babies. They won't shoot arrows into us. Hopefully they will. They will eat a lOt of your babies. No, hopefully they won't. You like your babies. You don't want them get eaten otherwise you can't spread. You see it across the country. What's, when did we make enemies with the indians? Why did they attack? And it just like steal the women and stuff. Listen, everybody that lands in a country and this country is an attacker.

Speaker 1:          01:16:22       Yeah. You know, you might not think of yourself as an attacker. You think of yourself as a colonist, but you're an attacker. If you're running into people that were already there, you know, and you can say, well, hey, you know, we, they should make room for us to, okay, maybe. But maybe they don't want to because there's. Yeah. And if you show any aggression to them and you taking food out of their children are to get these things out of here. Yeah. And then there was also the fucking treaties that were broken and all the. Here's some crimes, smallpox blankets for you all. Yeah. All the horrific crimes that were perpetrated on the american indian. I mean, god, you starting to hear those stories and think about it and he hears about the slaughter and the fucking mass genocide and the, just the numbers. Yeah. You know what Australia, they're respectful

Speaker 5:          01:17:10       of aboriginal people. If one aboriginal kills another one, the white people don't deal with it.

Speaker 1:          01:17:16       You guys saw in you to deal with us. You know, it freaked me out when they have their own justice system. Freaked me out when I was, there was a, they were telling me about, um, during the fifties, I guess it was where they had this concerted effort. They decided to take aboriginal children from their parents, steal them and raise them in the white world. Oh. Like to, to help them to benefit them. So, so craZy and dark. But the idea was that they were going to try to civilize these people and the only way to do it would be the fucking kids. Like that was a real plan that was involved with that. Yeah, man. They took their kids. Oh wow. They took their kids because they believed that their culture was better. So much better. It's so good. You don't think so. That's so crazy. That's so crazy that people could take people's children.

Speaker 6:          01:18:09       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:18:10       It's so crazy.

Speaker 1:          01:18:12       And you know, apparently like they have a lot of the same issues that american indians have with alcohol problems in their communities. Aboriginals. Aborigines, yeah. The native americans. I apparently it's a genetic issue with a lot of them that they don't have long. Yeah. Their ancestors didn't develop the tolerance and they weren't accustomed to alcohol the way like europeans were. So apparently aboriginal people in Australia had a similar problem. So a lot of them, there's a lot of alcoholism, a lot of real problems with. I don't know if they ever had alcohol before, but they probably didn't have the shit that we have. Even if theY had their own alcohol, if they didn't have wild Turkey, they didn't. They dIdn't ever have any crazy tequilas. They didn't have some shifts. It might add some fermented berry juice that of gets you high if you leave it out and chase off the flies. Yeah, but they were so arrogant that they thought it was okay to take their kids. Wow. That's sell a mean horrible. Pulling a kid away from a mom. Horrifying. Terrifying. The ugliest aspects of humanity.

Speaker 5:          01:19:17       Yeah. I mean, the thing I started thinking recently, so I thought about Philip Morris, the tobacco companies, and you think of their evil people like trying to addict you even though they know it's already like bad for you, but they're not evil people. TheY're just people that had a job there that are doing that stuff. They're not. These are all old men. There's just people Who got a job and now they're still doing that job even though know it's terrible sort of.

Speaker 1:          01:19:45       Someone has to make the decision to sell cigarettes. Yeah, and you could easily just say, oh, I'm not gonna. I'm not gonna. Take this job. Then the encountered from cigarettes are going to be a thing of the past. I think the shit that he's sucking on, that kind of thing, it's going to make much more sense for people. If that stops killing people, why wouldn't they do it? It's a nicotine distribution device.

Speaker 5:          01:20:03       Definitely getting people into smoking these again now and then it's helping. It's helping like

Speaker 4:          01:20:08       the tobacco farms find a way to make money because they've all invested heavily in it because new people were actually getting hooked on justice, smoking, nicotine. Now I've noticed

Speaker 3:          01:20:16       what is the actual health of those friendships? Those are outlawed in New York now. Really? Yup. Indoors, because they said I'm a secondhand smoke, but he builds vapor, but they said they put. The problem is they put on their package. I'm safer than smoking cigarettes and then you have to prove that you can't just say that you show me a study. That is the problem. You do have to prove that, you know, it's like some sort of like ses carcinogen or something where it falls into the same category as cigarettes doesn't seem like that blue cigarettes stuff. It lingers. Mill lingers more like smoke. I don't smell it though.

Speaker 4:          01:20:54       You definitely smell like. Because how I found out about this actual one, this girl was smoking it and it smelled like strawberries and I just walked by and like, what was that strawberry snatcher vagina and shit, and then she showed it to me and I'm like, all right, I'm lending that, but it does smell, but yeah. And I can see if you don't like strawberry and then you walk around the library yet. But people with perfume and

Speaker 3:          01:21:16       no, there's nothing wrong with that smell. You smell it. I smell it when you just did it, but it smells nice. It's like a nice smell. Smell like cigarettes. Cigarettes are disgusting, man. You used to come into the car after you smoke cigarettes. Brian would like pretend he wasn't smoking. He wouldn't go stick to them in the cold. Oh, when you come you'd come into the car and we would all smell it. Like, oh dude, that's nasty. people don't like to hear that shit. People that smoke cigarettes especially. Oh yeah. They don't like to hear what. You can't smell it. Okay, fine. I guess I made up the smell. I just smelled so stinky, stinky in the cold and the cold. Come in, stinky. Fuck off a cigarette. Smells stinky. Fucking smell it. It's gross. It's bad for you to fucks. Wait. No that it's bad for you.

Speaker 3:          01:21:59       Don't do it. Get it together. These will be better for that. It'll probably will take off probably with a cigarette in 10 years. We'll probably out there, but this is the thing. They say that nicotine is actually an infect a, an effective cognitive boost. It gives you like a little. That was one of the things that Steven King said when Stephen King stop smoking cigarettes. He said he really felt it. He really felt the difference in these synapses firing his, the way he described it and writing his books and nicotine as sort of a stimulating effect on, on, on thinking and creativity for a lot of people. But it's the tar, the tobacco, the kudzu. It's. Well no, it's a lot of the chemicals. There's, there's like 590 chemicals that they add to cigarettes on top of the tobacco itself. All approved bar, lovely government, but these insane chemicals are essentially designed to change the flavor and to make more addictive. You know what to do with the nicotine. They have a certain amount, they'll shoot it up real high like all of a sudden from five to seven and then everyone has to smoke less cigarettes because it's like all of a sudden I get in too much, so they always want to like half a cigarette or whatever and they're getting their fix of whatever they need and then they

Speaker 2:          01:23:06       plummeted. Once you get used to that, they plummeted down, like to. Yeah, and then you start smoking more because he's not getting what you need. Then they push it right back up to average again. Wait a minute, they variant but on occasion in order to get you fucking more addicted. They do that. Now that they already know it causes death. They're still trying to get you more addicted. Well, I didn't know that they can do that. So they can vary the amount of nicotine that. How do you know this is? That's what a word on the street Is a motherfucker. That's what I've heard from smokers. I think big jay told me that it's. It's a dark business man, that's for sure. Especially if you've ever seen anybody that's dying a cigarettes, emphysema, people that are dying of lung cancer. I not. I'm mike side of that though.

Speaker 2:          01:23:49       Really? He got a stage four tumor. That's when they found him dead and like two weeks it wouldn't make any sense and I'm going, whoa. Smoked a lot of cigarettes. I smoke a lot of cigarettes. Mike lacey from the comedy magic club was a team made you cry that time brian, who was telling you to stop smoking cigarettes? I was like crying because he gets to you dude. It's so nice. Such a nice guy. No, we probably look at me. Look at me. We care about you. We don't want you to tell you. They want to know is legit. Beautiful person. Girl at the same day or something. I don't know. Maybe your cat hurt its foot shoving cigarettes directly into your veins. You were opening up veins.

Speaker 2:          01:24:35       Yeah, I ripped. I can't fucking in any comfortable. You bad cry pretty easily. I almost cried the other day and it's just how many, what I'm drinking. I think sometimes maybe what you're drinking when she cried. Yeah. If I drink too much Turkey, that's why I need it in Turkey. I start crying like it's just like somebody that body's breaking down, stuff like that, or I think about something you can drink that much. Wild Turkey body's breaking down just slowly dying. It's getting poisoned. It's moaning. Like my, my old cat, he had fireball. Fireball. Have you had fire? It's been a while. What is it? Have you had it? That's like a cinnamony, right? What is it to. It's the shot that we used a used to be popular when I was in college and then went away and they got near the time of gold slog or an aftershock, like all these really weird, but then it kind of went away and it came back and they repackage it and everything. NoW it's like everywhere you go everyone's drinking fireball, but it's my new drink. Savages, savages. Each and every one of you. Cinnamon whiskey. I wanted to talk to you guys about this. A jerry seinfeld. Oh yeah, pull this up brian. Pull it up. It's on gawker. Gawker.com. G a w k e r, just pull up gawker. It's like right on the front page. It's who cares about diversity in comedy? Says jerry seinfeld. Oh yeah, that's a, that's not what you want. Just look up, look up. Uh,

Speaker 1:          01:26:04       just do a google search on the title diversity. Jerry seinfeld and he's getting just gawker diversity journey. Doing a public interview. Yeah. And people around. I don't want to comment on it until we actually pull the video up because I would like you to hear it from him first before we, even before we even comment on it, because it's, it's a, it's an important subject for guys like ari and I, you know, as, as comics, there's some shit that they're trying to attach to this here

Speaker 7:          01:26:33       of 22 episodes. Yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:26:36       got fucked up.

Speaker 7:          01:26:39       I have noticed that most of the guests are mostly white males. Have 22 episodes that you can get into that. No, but you take a look over here. Peter, what do you see? Yeah, a lOt of what's going on here. But, oh, this really pisses me off, but really pisses me off. Well, that's okay. Um, go ahead. But you made a comment on the tina fey episode that I thought was interesting that I, I'd like to get your thoughts on a little bit more. You said you were talking to her to that and you said something about the female comedians. It's a struggle for them to balance their feminine projections with their comedic gold in this context of comedy, not gender diverse. I just want to know what you meant by that. Well, I was kind of curious what it's like to be a woman in comedy as opposed to a man.

Speaker 7:          01:27:29       There was a little bit of a difference and I thought that might be an interesting thing to discuss from her perspective. She saw successful at it and I'm just wondering how she looked at it, if she even thought about it and she kind of gave me the answer, which is yeah, you do have to think about that, but you know, it's just another thing to think about. Okay. All right, fair enough. Now you, there were a lot of things about the comedians of cars in the beginning of the first 10 I did. I think we're all white males and people writing all about that, which I, part of the reason why I had people had tweeted at me when I said I'm interviewing with jerry seinfeld. I'll ask him about their gender diversity on this. I mean, it's, people think it's the census or something. I may represent the, the actual pie chart of, of America. Who cares? It's just funnY. Funny is, is the, is the world that I live in. You're funny. I'm interested. You're not funny. I'm not interested and I have no interest in gender or race or anything like that, but everyone else is kind of with their little calculating. Is this the exact right mix? You know? Uh, I, I think that's a, to me it's anti comedy. It's comedy, it's more about, you know, pc nonsense. Then are you making us laugh or not? Right, right.

Speaker 1:          01:28:47       Yeah. Well they went off on that so that See, it shows that he's like racist. Well, I saw people, uh, I saw a video on don't even want to bring it up. I don't even Want to pull the video up because I don't want to watch it again because it was so annoying. Uh, people that were taking that and saying that that's a problem. They're taking that and he's not saying all, I don't care if he's saying I don't, I only care about what's funny, trying to make things funny and he's not concerned about making them diverse. It's like if you think about with mustaches on your show, because I wasn't even thinking about that, that's what he said. And you should be able to do creatively whatever you want, especially when your goal is just make stuff funny. Like why should he have to.

Speaker 1:          01:29:25       I mean if you, if I watch a show with all koreans in it, I don't get upset that there's no white people say that. Well, you know what, that's just because you're white and you're privileged and there's an overall problem maybe of not using enough black people are not using enough people of color, but that's not each individual shoots problem. Well, It's, it's not the best thing about this world that you know, there's racism, it's one of the worst things, right? It's not the best thing about our culture that, you know, we aren't equally represented in the media. It's not the best thing when you have to, you know, you have to factor in populations, you have to factor in, you know, how long the, these people who have been in the business, how long these people have been in the business. A lot of shit going on.

Speaker 1:          01:30:09       When you talk about putting a fucking show on television, a lot of people think that once someone gets into a position where they have a successful show, then on top of having to create that show, they also have an obligation to be diverse because they're representing America and they're supposed to like give opportunities to like a equal percentage of the population. For that story. Storyteller show, this is where it's a problem because no know what you should be able to do what you're not talking about. Like sOme government position we're talking about is a creative thing that you're making. You should, if you are comfortable doing it only with black people, you should only deal with black people if then, because they're probably like, well, I asked like four or five girls. None of them could do it, so I did my part. what am I suppose to get somebody worse?

Speaker 1:          01:30:52       Just because, yeah, it's ridiculous. You should especially like that. Like the storyteller type thing. You should get whoever you think is good. It's your show things that you think are interesting, but I know you. So I know if you find a woman who's a gay black, uh, there's not that many black seven foot tall woman and she's really funny. You're fucking lover and you'll start talking about our gracious. If she's a five foot nine white girl, you know who's really cute, but she's really hilarious. You'll say she's really hilarious. I know you don't give a shit about anything funny. So just one of the reasons why I wanted to play this when you're here because it's like, thIs is what you should be focused on, but they're tricking him. They're setup question. It is a setup question because it's a. It's a kind of a goofy, you know what he's trying to do when he's trying to make a good council. He's also pretty much most of that show is him in a car getting coffee with his friend and look, this clicks. Yeah. We'll have the people that hang out with and there's not that many black comics at the clubs. There's nothIng wrong with it. That's the point. It's just who he is and who his friends are. Yeah. He did a shoW with those four people, so we're going to have them on.

Speaker 3:          01:32:00       We're going to force a black guy and it's like it just have in this mostly his friends and look what happens when they had chris rock on. They got pulled over, so it's just. Yeah, at the end of their rope instead they got pulled over. He should be able to do whatever the fuck you want. It's his thing, you know, he shouldn't be able to do whatever he wants, but you know, the idea that you should even debating that he's got issues because what he wants is different than when you. Because it doesn't represent the exact numbers, so he had three out of 20. If you have five out of 20, would have been okay. Nothing wrong with sex and the city. There's nothing wrong with the show them that is wrong. No. If you're a woman and you were in your forties when that shit came out, you would love it.

Speaker 3:          01:32:36       It's just wrong for ari shaffir, but for them, nothing wrong. Women in entertainment, if it's bunch of women doing shit for women, they should be able to cast whatever women they want to cast. It shouldn't be a man that steps up and says, hey, my favorite use about left on television, saw it was a billboard of a girl. Hold the gun up and another girl hold another gun up and then another guy behind her, like in the force also and you're like, what is that? Lifetime television. It's like scifi for women like tHis could never exist. Yeah. What are you talking about? You're hot and you're leaving the squad and the guys behind you. It's just accepting that role is like psi phi for women. It is. Wouldn't it be awesome with the world was like this? Yeah, they. There was a few of those fucking silly movies, but that's okay for them, man.

Speaker 3:          01:33:21       If that's what they want, it's okay. If that's what they want. Black entertainment is so bad. So bad. What you need them is fucking garbage. You mean like Tyler Perry? is that what you trying to say? Yes, absolutely. THat's one. That's what all of it's so bad. Have you ever seen like the cw, the black shows which shows whatever they are over the years, but we showed up to the wayans brothers to whatever with the wayans brothers. It's just bad entertainment. They're offering them. THey never offer them anything of value. You say them like there's some other people. Yeah. They offer that group. The blacks, the blacks, all their fucking black comedy movies. Just like, what is this soul plane? It's just goofy. Well, with Robert Townsend. Yeah. remember he used to deal with shuffling. He did some really cool, funny movies that would happen to people like that.

Speaker 3:          01:34:08       How many? Like when? It's really interesting because there's like a bunch of known a white comedy directors. Judd apatow guys who produce phillips of white, top phillips, one of those. Yeah. They're producing like white comedies, hilarious white comedies. You don't hear about a lot of black guys that are doing that. It's so true. Yeah, but aren't they white comedies or are they just comedies? Well, they're not because craig robinson was on a lot of them. Yeah, that's true. That's true. He was awesome and this is the end. He was really good in that. Fuck. Yeah, he was. I liked the part of michael cera got sabbath and somebody took my cell phone, started ringing his backpack. It's like, oh, that's really embarrassing. That was a funny movie, man. When kenny powers came in, that's when it became the most awesome movie ever. He's such a dickhead. He started washing is good with

Speaker 1:          01:34:58       their fucking whatever water they had remaining small amount of water, but again, I mean, you should be able to make a show with whoever you want to make a show. It doesn't make you a racist. Right? It's irrelevant. The terms you're talking about have nothing to do with that world, that world. That's what he said. It exists in funny, that's it, that's all that matters, but the idea that you should have affirmative action and comedy that you should then that's essentially what they're saying. They're saying that you should have to have x amount of women. You should have to have x amount of black people. if you don't, they're saying, wait a minute, do you have just a lot of white friends? But then the problem is then you're making female comedy worse. You're makiNg it worse for advancing people without merit. Making it overall worse while you can.

Speaker 1:          01:35:42       Most certainly, you know, the other argument would be that he just doesn't hang out in those cliques so he doesn't know these funny women and it would benefit everybody if he got to know them and had them on. I could see that argument. Maybe if there was like a pool of talent that you knew that was really fucking crackling that you wanted to have on your show, but at the end of the day it's who he wants to talk to. Like when people say to me like, why did you have a big foot expert on? Because I want to fucking talk to him. I don't know why do you have a bowhunting expert on? Because I want to talk to a bowhunting expert. Okay. This is interesting. You don't have to listen, you know, but if you want to, uh, I will do my best to try to make it entertaining and I will try to ask the questions that I have. I will try to explore as objectively and thoroughly. But that's my perspective and my point of view. So I mean, how, I mean, somebody asked me the other day like how many gay people we had on, I don't know, like three or four or something like that. Like maybe melissa etheridge, todd glass martindale. Who else? We had some other ones out. Somebody. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:36:47       Well whoever the fuck it was, um, you know, and someone was like, well why haven't you had more? Whatever. Who cares? Like, why, why do I have to now I don't want to. How about that? Now you're bringing up. I'm annoyed, you know? But then it's also like, am I just not friends enough with black people or gay people? This man, anybody. I find interesting. I'll talk to. I give zero fuckS about what they look like. I don't care. I don't care if someone's black or white or fat or skinny. If they're interesting. They're interesting. I don't care. I really don't. I don't care what your kind of music you like. I don't give a fuck. It doesn't. I'm not judgmental on that stuff. please don't talk to anybody. I'm sweatpants in it to jeff's son. I'm into it. I'm sweatpants in it with a jacket jacket on, fat fanny back with my higher primate logo. Have you seen the higher primates? Fanny pack rat. So sexy, sexy. Once you see it, you'll unDerstand. My passion was government eventually will have purses, but until then the higher primate fanny pack the shaft on the of that sign. Actually that beautiful leather. Look at the front. See that little

Speaker 3:          01:37:56       higher primate logo, so it's. Yeah, it's a monkey with a chimp rather with a light bulb. I was sad like I got an idea. First idea, the first idea because that's the first step. A curious chimp. We used to always look at these charts, the comedy store to see who got what. Rosa, who's hire private was a few we didn't know. That's not my company. My company's. Well, I can't tell you it shouldn't take it online. Well, everybody keep it together. But uh, the um, the higher primate fanny pack, it's just the beginning from there. I'm on my last launch, a bunch of other get up. She me off. You see what natasha did when she had a thing for new year's eve? Yes, yes. Yeah. People are mad at her and she made up. There's no reason to get mad. It's so dumb. And she made the best apology you could ever make.

Speaker 3:          01:38:44       It was perfect. It was like, sorry. You misunderstood it. Their old, their teeth fall out when they're old. That's the joke. Well, not only that, she was like, she was pretty clear that she was just joking around, you know, it's pretty obvious that it was just real. Veterans are being mistreated as they come home. Now that's the issue. You should worry about if you want to honor the veterans. It's a joke and it's not that people were really upset. Is it that people think that they have the license to be upset and then they can get you in trouble now what I was trying to do, they're trying to get you in trouble. what I was just trying to change things. They're trying to get you in trouble, in trouble. They can feel. Yeah, they can contact the network so you should do something with this.

Speaker 3:          01:39:21       Like you don't have anybody in your family that says something that dumb. Occasionally they missed one. You know they go for a little old person. JOy when vengeance and I deserved vengeance. She should be fired. If an opposite of a drama is not any good, you can't fire anybody. That's what I want to see as if it's not such an innocuous joke. If it actually is a borderline like rape or murder or pedophile joke where it's not completely nothing and it's not a cute woman doing the non-apology. I want to see how people get that or people like chris rock or plus out again, tracy morgan and just do a one 80 and go from like. No, you can say whatever he wants to. Well, all right. You go too far. So what happened? Chris rock, awkward. TracY morgan to have that thing with the case.

Speaker 3:          01:39:59       He said he went too faR. it just totally flipped as well. There's certain. Wow. There's certain things that you feel like you can't fucking endorse. Yeah. That lack kind of gay bashing, like saying that he would stab his, his son if his son was gay. People can endorse that. I can endorse that, but if you know tracy morgan forever, it's what he does. He says ridiculously outrageous shit that he doesn't really mean and now because it's popular, we're going to go against it. You caN't eat wants. You know what he's doing. Everybody knows what he's doing. It's like a joke to pretend that he's not saying something completely outrageous, that he absolutely doesn't matter how old you are, how old you want. Oh, you must be fast. Fast. My piece low. Yeah. He rubs his belly, so we'll get pregnant who slap his belly

Speaker 1:          01:40:54       on that tv, show someone getting pregnant tonight to someone getting pregnant, you know, that's his whole thing was a real room that he couldn't read a real legitimate rumor that people are telling charlie barnett couldn't read. That's how he couldN't get on the saturday night live. Really? Yeah. Charlie barnett was. Chris was shaped chappelle's teacher that's mentor him and a lot of other guys. When I was in New York, he was already not there anymore. I don't know where he was. He died, died of aids, I believe. um, but he was a, like a guy who was dave chappelle. He sort of taught dave chappelle had to do, um, that those street side shows. I think I might be talking to school, but I have seen dave chappelle do a street side show. Dave chappelle in montreal. It was pretty hilarious when he was really young too, is when I first met him.

Speaker 1:          01:41:42       I think he was probably like, I first met him in New York and then I saw him again up in montreal when he was like, maybe like 19 sit on the side. He took his hat off, put his hat on the ground and did a comedy show and then pass the hat around. Wow. And people put money in it. It was before he was famous and he would just do it at the drop of a hat. Just do javelin notice. Just when he was funny. It was good. He would kick cassius developed to get the crowd. Like he must've developed certain things in order to get them to gather around. I think he would just call them around and you know, he looks like a guy who would be fun to listen to the talk so people slow down, you know, some, some folks are in a hurry and some folks aren't.

Speaker 1:          01:42:20       And the ones that aren't, they circle them and then he'll do like a little five minute comedy show and then pass a hat around. I saw him do it in montreal. Well apparently charlie barnett used to do that and he was like legendary out. It was awesome. He was awesome at like being hilarious to a bunch of people, like off the cuff, he had material that he would do, but they will also be off the cuff funny and he would gather people around. Then he would hand out of the hat, pass out the hat, you know, and that's how he would make some money. And uh, he became famous, like doing comedy, did a lot of standup people, loved him onstage and then he got an audition for saturday night live and apparently the word was that he got the part but he couldn't read.

Speaker 1:          01:42:56       So since he couldn't read scripts, they couldn't hire them. That's tough. The working environment without being able to route. And apparently he had a, he had a problem with intravenous drugs and he loved them. Yeah. He found out about them. That's the problem, you know, and uh, but he apparently was like a keep saying apparently apparently or adjectives or words. He was like one of the pioneers of that style of comedy. Like, yeah, like natural talking. Yeah. Well, not just natural talking, but like knowing how to captivate a group and get everybody settled down and put out a hat. Like that's a. That's such a tough crowd that when you go onto a stage at a comedy club must be nothing. Yeah. It's like you're running up hill all day. Whenever we saw the third street promenade people before we ever would have thought of that to comedy here, could I do it?

Speaker 1:          01:43:46       Yeah. It's hard though. I've never seen anybody do it besides dave. I've never seen anybody just do like street comedy seems weird. It does. I see that goofy. Like the dancers will do comedy in between when they're going to make a dance. Well, I don't think dave would do it today. I mean, I know he did do some shows in seattle when remember when he wasn't doing official shows anymore. I did a show in seattle where it just showed up and brought like a speaker and started doing stand up in the park. Yeah. Wow. Let's put it down his. His career has been fucking fascinating. It was a fascinating guy. You ever heard? I'm on the podcast. I would definitelY, but I've never run into him. I need to run into him. I haven't run into him since I've been doing it. He said I ran into him a couple times. I got to get ahold of him. He would be awesome to have on. You know. I bet he's a good dude, man. He's a funny fucking guy too. He's a funny guy. He's been. He's been funny for a long

Speaker 5:          01:44:42       do. When he came back from africa and did that show in the main room? I don't know if that was. If that was after you stopped going there before. Have that on tape too. Really? In my car. It was so packed and everybody was there. Fucking Bruce Willis was there. Soundgarden was there. The fire department showed up and just asked if theY could sit on the steps to block the pug and escape. Wow. Everybody. That was the ticket. Did you see kiss the other night was at house of blues and there was like arnold schwarzenegger was there. Stallone was their families doing the podcast. Oh really? Yeah, dog. The bounty hunter. You got eddie bravo to come into.

Speaker 1:          01:45:17       Don't. No, I don't know if eddie can, but I'm going to get an ace freely to. Oh wow. Awesome. I met ace freely when I was like seven years old, how my uncle was a, he was an artist and he worked for the advertising agency that created the album covers and the album art. I was back when they had, you know, there were artwork for the album was you would open up like especially like to dislike kiss alive to have to uh, records in it and it would open up. THere's all these images and advertising, you know, guys would put together these albums, know they made the artwork. So they hired artists, graphic artists to create these things. And ace really came into the office and I was uh, just staying. I went to work with my uncle, like he took me to work with them because he was an artist at the time too.

Speaker 1:          01:46:00       I was really into art and so he wanted to see me to see like what his office is like fucking case maybe I wanted to do it someday and I just so happened to be. He took me in a couple of times, but it just so happened to be there the day that ace freely arrived. Was he wearing this makeup or no, no makeup. That's why I was so crazy because at the time it was. I'm like no one knew what they looked like. They would walk around with bandannas over their face. It was, yeah, it was a big thing like photographers, we're constantly trying to catch them. Oh wow. Yeah. They were trying to catch them out because if they caught them they would get the first photo of them. There was a few calls like this where you'd see you would take this much as face. You wouldn't see as total face you just a little bit.

Speaker 1:          01:46:44       So you saw him. Yeah. So I saw him when I was like, I think it was like seven or eight or something like that. It was crazy. I couldn't believe it. I was like, starstruck. Tell the rest of the classmates and have them not believable. Well, my cousin had seen them a bunch. My cousin, I own a, um, she was uh, like friends with them and they would go play softball together and like she would talk about it. She's like, it's the weirdest thing. I played softball with gene simmons and like you had no makeup on. We were playing softball with kiss and no one knows it's kits they have no makeup on and you're like, this is the nuttiest thing ever. And my uncle Was like, he's a really cool character, very artistic character. So hIs daughter was very cool as well. She was really, she's really smart and she, you know, so like her describing it was very, it was like she was not, she was totally taking into account the bizarreness of it.

Speaker 1:          01:47:33       She's like some standing there and I'm playing softball with kiss and asm got this glove on. I'm looking around and she's like, what the soft with these guys didn't have makeup on. This is, this is the most famous. but I mean she was my age. We were both like, you know, like oh, they were huge. Really? Yeah. they were gigantic. I saw them in the nineties when I saw them in the seventies when I was a little kid. My uncle took me to show and uh, that's when he was working for the company back then. I was really young when they took me to a kiss show. That's weird. I might've been, I might've been like 10 or something like that, maybe 11 at the most. I was 11, but he took me to a kiss show. Then I went to a couple and then I went to two in a row with Kevin James and yeah, in the, the, uh, the nineties, a kiss when they made their comeback.

Speaker 1:          01:48:21       It was the nineties or the early 2000. I think it might have been 90 days. I don't think I was even on fear factor yet. And kevin was out here. Kevin had won star search and search sort of push. Man. Kevin is a bad motherfucker. Norm mcdonald. Kevin's one of the most underrated standups ever. Really? He went. He's. Yes, yes. Listen to me. That dude, he could hit moments onstage. He had some Bits on stage. They were fucking murderers, but he always wanted us to keep it clean and family friendly and he wanted to like, you know, make it so he didn't want to piss anybody off. He didn't want people to not be able to go to his shows, you know, he, he kept his act real clean, especially once he had can't queens, you know that he cleaned up even more. He, well he was just, you know, he would never do a bit that you would do or I would do.

Speaker 1:          01:49:07       Never did. Another one is our specialty. I was one of the first hour specials because we're just too big for a half hour and it was just like, let me tell you something. I was with that dude when he was coming up. before you go to any of that shit, that guy could kill me. He was hilarious. He was really funny. He used to do this bit about getting pissed because kevin is a sweet guy. He's an awesome guy, but if he gets pissed off, he's got a fucking temper. He doesn't do anythIng, but he does get angry at shit. He's not a violent guy, but you could see I'm fucking crazy about you. So yeah. Had this bit about his girlfriend. He was like hitting the unlock button on the door at the same time and she was pulling the handle and they cancel each other out and you have this bit where they kept doing it again and do it and it builds up and fucking hilarious bit and he would go ape shit on stage and scream and I don't even think he swore back down and you might swear he like a little bit like shit or something like that.

Speaker 1:          01:49:56       Like every now and then. But you know, he was trying to do like a very specific type of comedy. You know, a story about him in montreal or aspen with sussman struck a deal. He got where you're like, come talk to my guy. Couldn't see what he can get you. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. That's an unfortunate story, but I don't think we could repeat that because it's very bad for someone's business or whatever. Yeah, we, we can't repeat numbers either, but yeah, he got lucky and got a good manager. My manager knew exactly what to do. They were trying. He had other older manager that wasn't given them such great advice and they were about to get them to make a terrible take this thing to a lot of shitty things to them. One of the things that said, no one would ever believe this if you never worked in hollywood, but there was a guy that was working with him before that actually told him to not lose weight category.

Speaker 1:          01:50:47       Yep, he dId. The actual quote was, kevin, when you lose weight, you're losing roles. Wow. He actually said that to him. When you lose weight, when you get healthy, no one's going to like you. When you get healthy, it's not a. It's not possible for you to be this funny unless you're a fat fuck. Okay, so stay a fat fox so we can all make money. Kevin, when you lose weight, you're losing roles. We're losing money. Kevin. People don't want you to know early, but we can use you. It's the worst thing ever because it gave him a green light to eat. Whatever the fuck you want. Kevin, when I first met him was like a pretty stout character, you know, and he was even thinner and more stout when he was in high school and he was really into karate for awhile, did a lot of karate, really in good shape and when he's in really good shape, he was 200 pounds and that man just a tank. It was all pictures of Joyce Diaz. We were like, who's that? He's a tank. Yeah. But when it. When a guy tells you shit like that, like you lose weight, you're losing roles. You're given a guy a green light to just eat whatever the fuck you want, you know, that's rude. They're just trying to make money. They're just, it just idiots. People that want to tell you how you should be, you know, you shouldn't be healthy. There's kevin.

Speaker 7:          01:51:57       I don't need an iron anymore. That's pretty cool. and it's so hot down here. I cannot take it anymore. Although my role, I have air conditioning, which I love. It's great because I grew up without air conditioning. It was the worst. My dad was too cheap. It was like we'll

Speaker 1:          01:52:09       do is bits because he probably wouldn't like that because it starts two minute comedy. Yeah. SO weird. Yeah. You probably would go, god, you fucking do my bed. You know, comedians are like, take a chunk of their material and put it on. Like, oh, I hate that shit. Don't fucking do that. But he would kill me. Man. He was really funny. He just, you know, decided to. He got really into making the tv show. I really enjoy the process of really making a sitcom now. He's good. He's good at that shit. He's good at comedic acting, you know? I just really wish you would really chased comedy more. Stand up guy was so funny, man. He used to kill me when we were kids where like in our early twenties together and we would do gigs together. We did a lot of gigs together. He was hilarious man.

Speaker 1:          01:52:55       He was hilarious dude. And he was like real honest about his insecurities and show people. Some of them we started with are actually still around. Yeah. A lot of them are still around eight it. Yeah. A lot of them have made it real in this. Yeah, like norton norton and I had been friends since fuck since we were both like 21 or something like that. You know, we're both like my open mic days. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Well greg fitzsimmons is my oldest friend ever. greg fitzsimmons and I literally went on stage like within a week of each other. Wow. We were friends in the dark, dark days of open mic nights. We were buddies back when we were complete amateurs. Neither one of them. We were terrible. We have nothing. So to like be friends with your friends now see him like I downloaded the past six months where we're small.

Speaker 1:          01:53:46       Not so good for sure. But I, I downloaded his new comedy special. He just has a comedy special is that's put out that the one where he talks about how, how easy americans have it. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, it's fucking great. Um, but I listened to it on a, on the way home from a gig and was laughing my ass off. It was really fucking funny, you know, it was really funny and it was so cool to be able to drive home and listened to, you know, that I started with and he's slaying and even more cool for me for greg because greg for a while was a. Greg is a multiple time any emmy winning writer. OH yeah. Was money writing. Well, he's like, you know, he's won emmys. He's a really good writer. You know, he's got a good book as well, but he decided to take some time off at doing standup.

Speaker 1:          01:54:35       He didn't do standup for a long time. It really didn't. I mean maybe did it occasionally, but he really didn't dive into it like he's back doing now. And then he, after he did it, every dove back into it, then he put out this special and so it was, it was like extra cool driving around listening to that special because I knew what he did. I knew how he worked. I knew, I knew that he got back into comedy and I knew that he really loved it. Again, you know, it's like a lot of our friends, we talk about that, like calvin and I had the same conversation every week, like he was just in some club, but like he did a cap city and austin and we're on the phone, you know, we're just both in our cars just catching up and he goes, he goes, it's the greatest fucking job in the world.

Speaker 1:          01:55:16       It's the greatest fucking job. I don't want to do anything else. He goes, I do other things. I don't want to do them. He goes, what I want to do is I want to do comedy. I want to tell jokes. It's so fun when you watch them on stage. I've had a chance to do some shows with him lately too, and you could see him just really enjoying this, having done all these movies and all these tv shows that he didn't really necessarily enjoy because he thought he was supposed to be an actor and then seeing him just murdering with his own silly goose style of comedy. Because he's so silly, you know, really fucking great to see man. Really great to see. Really funny, funny shit too man. Like having, knowing guys. I've known calvin since [inaudible] 94 early. So I've known greg since ada.

Speaker 1:          01:55:58       Greg's the longest running friends in comedy, but collin and I have been best friends. It's like the moment we met, you know, I mean there's like, there's like a core group. I just went to New York. No, I met him out here. I did. I'm mad tv. Oh, he was on mad tv and I was the host of mad tv. He was on seventh heaven for like a bunch of episodes. Yeah, he did fucking seventh. Heaven and oz don't pull up videos of us on mad tv. I know what you're doing. You were children back then, but we became friends almost immediately, like we said, like three or four sentences together and we were playing and hanging out together. Yeah. It's just a fun dude, you know? I knew. He said it's hard to make fun friends, but it's cool when you run into him and you collect them, you know, was like, oh, I found a good one.

Speaker 1:          01:56:42       It's good friend, and then you see that guy prosper. You see that guy growing and developing is like. It's one of the Most depressing things when you see a guy who used to do good, like, I don't want to say any names, but guys that we know that had potentIal and then they fell off and then they stopped doing comedy altogether and you're like, my god. We came up together. Like that guy was just as good as me in 1998. Like what the fuck? Yeah, they stopped, they stopped, they stopped doing comedy and they, you know, he got a job. Like what job doing what? Why did he see? Oh my god, why didn't you follow up? scares everybody else too. Like I said, a possibility. Yeah. One of the guys we know stop people don't know. They don't understand and that's why they get angry.

Speaker 1:          01:57:22       When I use the word civilian, by the way people, everyone who gets angry because I use the word civilian comics, go fuck yourself for real, for real. Go fucking stop your whining. Stop your demand for respect. Stop all of it up. You know what we're talking about you dummies. We're talking aBout the dIfference between someone who understands the fucking hectic, chaotic mental bore you go on in your head when you're being a standup comic. We're describing the mass of of this life that you Will not understand if you don't do it. Just like if you're a Stock broker and I'm not, and you call me a civilian, I'm not going to get offended. I wouldn't get offended. By the way, if I was a fucking soldier either, I wouldn't get offended. You know what people are saying? It's called a Figure of speech. Don't be a can. FInd some other shit to be a cut. Don't be a can. Find some other shit to be annoyed that there's plenty of things that are real that you can be annoyed at. Don't be annoyed if somebody uses the term sensibility. That's silly.

Speaker 4:          01:58:16       You see that video of that comedian and Tennessee that there was like a group in the front row that were like wrestlers and stuff like that. Like these big guys start heckling and then the guy gets on stage and racks and right in the balls. Rex who comments? oh no, here's the video.

Speaker 1:          01:58:31       Oh, I don't want to see this man. The guy is huge too. It's a little cafe. I don't even know wHere that is. He hit him in the balls. He gets on stage and then racks and racks. And why did you get the racks? Oh, he told them what it means. Do you know the term

Speaker 7:          01:58:49       steak? Shake my hand and be like, did it? I guess still in the room are so delightful compared to this train wreck over here. Where did he start doing it? Man. Just wrote about the outbreak role play. Role play gets catholic school girls. Every time

Speaker 1:          01:59:38       we'll find it. Then the heckler. Why was he still in the room? These clubs like tack the comic, tell them to leave, settle his bill and leave. Guy comes on stage and taps you in the balls. It's over there, just a little too comfortable hitting each other. You know, when you hit each other for a living, like wrestlers slap each other in the face. A regular person just not like that. They don't want to deal with that shit at all. Like people wHo don't respect professional wrestling. Look, you might not enjoy it as a form of entertainment, but you better respect like how hard it is to do hyper camera. This store, the, the those guys fucking. They sacrificed every part of their bau, weathered. They're all broken up, man. That is a crazy fucking way. or try to make a living. He's throwing chairs at each other and shit and jumping off the top rope and fucking doing flips and landed on your face.

Speaker 1:          02:00:36       Yeah, that's some crazy shit, man. That is one of the most destructive jobs in show business as far as like what it does to your body laying on the ground. OH my god. Do you remember the brock lesnar one? We did the shooting star press. You know the. He flew, did a flip, but he missed the flip and landed on his fucking head. Oh really? Yeah. He was trying to do a flip and like pinot guy, like he was going to do top rope and do a flip and pinot guy, but he missed. It's just bam. Right on his fucking head. I hit slip. oh, that guy just need him in the balls.

Speaker 7:          02:01:17       I know.

Speaker 1:          02:01:22       Okay. Just I don't want to watch this man. That's fucked up. Harsh. Yeah. You shouldn't let that guy on stage. He definitely should have said, what are you gonna do like what's up with that fake bravado of having that guy on stage and saying, what are you going to do in this fucking giant wrestler guy standing in front of me, but balls taunting him. He shouldn't be on stage, first of all. Definitely for sure. But you know the fucking shows basically. It's a weird position. I always like, oh, what do you want me to walk away? Well, yeah, you getting bullied by a giant wrestler too. I mean that guy was twice the size of that guy. It should mean why don't you go back and sit down and nobody throws them out. It's ridiculous. You can't go onstage and need somebody in the balls and then they don't throw you out.

Speaker 1:          02:01:56       That's bad. Why can't you get sued for that? Like even like just this random strangers kneed me in the balls. That's not part of my job. Yeah. You should be able to sue for that. The club for for sure. You should be able to see the guy. Yeah. The guy for nina in the ball. Well tammy Had that drink thrown on her and she tried to press charges and the sheriff was like, nah, it's just comedy. Why? She's like, he threw a drink at my head. He threw a glass at my head. I want to press charges. That's assault. They didn't bring them in. That's, that's insane. You can't throw a glass at somebody if he hit her. That's a fucking weapon. It's just part of comedy. It's like, what? Why? Why is it part of comedy? We don't agree to that fucking lazy cop.

Speaker 1:          02:02:34       That's what that is. That's a guy that didn't want to fill out some paperwork. That was with tammy because the actual assault didn't happen. I don't know because it didn't actuallY hit her or he's a local and she's not so like I'm not going to arrest somebody. HAve some traveling in la. It wasn't here. It was on the road somewhere. Oh, well it's like, that doesn't make any sense. Like where did this take place? It must have been some fucking hillbilly. Yeah. I don't know exactly. Texas or somewhere. A asheville making shit up. You just making sure. I don't know where it was. Nowhere near each other. Somewhere in Canada. Something. So I read back in Florida, I don't know. Something.

Speaker 1:          02:03:10       yeah man, that's not cool. But you know, that's one of the problems with owning a club. You want a club, you're serving people. One of the most ridiculous drinks, one of the most ridiculous drugs when it comes to behavior, like managing your behavior towards lights. You just give people like this drug that makes them want to behave like a fucking asshole, like a good percentage of people want to behave like an asshole on that, on that drug. And then you're selling that. That's what you sell and you need them to be around. And then you got some guy who was on stage talking mad shit about sucking decks and shooting common to people and people getting crazy. Good, crazy. They're drunk and someone's talking about sex and crazy. Yeah. they get nutty and they, they just can't believe what they hear and they want another drink.

Speaker 1:          02:03:57       Where's that fucking waitress? I want to drag. Yeah, they heard somebody talking loud and there's a lot of that. We shut the fuck up. LIke sometimes you hear that you guys need to shut the fuck up and they hear that like in the audience, like people arguing and people or somebody else tells them to be quiet because they can't hear. Last time we were at um, for a duncan and I were at the hollywood improv in Florida. And like some people almost duked it out. Yeah. Because one gRoup was talking, the other group turned around. They were like, you shut the fuck up. Like a guy like jumped up and he was pointing at these big fucking giant fat guy. You shut the rob ford looking type character. He was screaming at people and they were screaming back at him. And it was like, wow, in the middle, in the middle of the fucking, you guys aRe all this

Speaker 3:          02:04:38       disruptive. Please stop that. Yeah. He was getting super angry and loud because the guy behind him was loud. Like iT was more about him than it was even about. it wasn't like he, even though there was like 300 people there for the show. Like I understand that this guy was being a dick, but him, his yelling made it way crazier for everybody else. Like he wasn't concerned about that. Like once the confrontation started, it doesn't matter. Sorry everybody. But everybody. Yeah. Everybody else. Fuck you. Fucking superman gun into his latest one. Just destroying buildings. Got into a fight and destroyed buildings. That's so stupid. Why does he fight in the desert? If you're superman, you grabbed guys. You bring them out in the desert and kicked her out. So it here. You kick people's ass in the middle of the city. Fucking dummy. You could fly around the world in a second and you choose to duke it out in the city.

Speaker 3:          02:05:24       You're an asshole. Guilty connects case. Send them to the side. Say if I was a fucking judge and superman came in and he told me smash these buildings apart. Be like, what? Why didn't you take him to the moon? Duke it out up there. You fucking asshole. Oh yeah, that's right. I think he wants. He can do anything. Superman can fly to space. He's fucking superman. Yeah. You can't see. He lives in a different kind of planet. Man. Never likes to americans. That reason. I'm like, he seemed indestructible. Yeah, totally likable. Unless you get that kryptonite. KryptOnite is right. It's what it makes them weak. It takes them out of character. Can't make decisions for himself. That is what it. Eventually it's success. Power way and he dies. So there's times where you just know you're making the wrong decision with a woman or with kryptonite, with a woman and you're just like, oh, why am I doing? Even as you're doing it, you're like, why? It's god because they have be up. Well, you know what it is, man. Your genes want to spread and you can't help it. And women who have beautiful bodies, like a woman's body is the most incredible backnet from. And I sort of came a little bit. I'll just wipe it off. It'll be fun.

Speaker 3:          02:06:34       Let me just get my finger in there and cleaned it out. I would not have made that decision yesterday. Like this dinner. What? No, I did not share. I did it with a black girl. Finally. Bam. Pete. And then tell me. Hold the story. Talking to them about how. I guess so I don't know. Just so you know everybody. My next storyteller shows in los angeles, February 27th at the improv. Me, mark, marin, ralphie may. Louis cuts so far. Wait. Yeah, $5. It's nice show. I liked that show. I liked the one that you had with natasha. Bobby lee's the going is easy. And you were all talking about the whole thing. It was a fun one. Yeah. Do you like it? Yeah, I loved it. It's so funny. I. Bobby can't not be funny. Yeah, that was a really good one. Look at. This is not happening. Go do a youtube search for that. You'll find it. But yeah, that was a good one. The eventually just lost control. If they just like, oh, whatever, keep going. I liked her bobby lives and to we both would you say, no, you're wrong in somebody else's. You're wrong. He'll go, oh, okay. All righT. It was really cool because I've heard that story so many times, but never actually

Speaker 5:          02:07:36       seen like a natasha around. All of us brought up the water thing. I can tell you were like, oh, I did do that. But you asked about who was right, who was wrong. It was like, it doesn't matter. I'm just embarrassed about my behavior. I don't care who else's behavior. Yeah. Because you dumped a water glass on her heartbreak man. It gets ya up. San jose improv march, middle of march and a against chicago this weekend. I love that place. I was just staring and go across the state that uh, yeah. Improv. Go across the street. There's a museum right there too.

Speaker 1:          02:08:11       Yeah. been hosea and probe down the street from joe's. Joe's original joe jo. Good. Oh, they have like a real wood grill for steaks there. Oh yeah. they have like real wood coals. They put lumped charcoal underneath the steak. It's a charcoal broiler. Really boiler. Yeah. Yeah, dude, you could watch them if you get a seat by the bar. We went there once with two fighters. We've been there a bunch of times. John fitch and mike's wick. That was a mix quick was telling us about how we used to work for, uh, the United States government. He was working in Russia and their buildings were bugged. The russians bugged the buildings with incredibly sophisticated equipment that, and he was like, they were so far ahead of what we were capable of. He said they had bugs that were operating on the power generated by the movement of the building in the breeze.

Speaker 1:          02:09:06       What figured out a way to generate enough power to keep the microphones going and, and transmitting, transmitting like producing energy. And they got it from the movement of the fucking swaying of the building. He was like, they were so far ahead of us. Why were they bugging his room? There were bugging the whatever building he was working at. Government building he was working with. people don't realize is that the, the soviet union during the cold war, like during the advancement of their, their rocket program, along with our rocket program, they got the first fucking guy in orbit man over. I mean they were incredibly advanced. They things. one of the reasons we've made up the moon landing. Well, I don't think we made up the moon landing. I've changed my position. I, yeah. This is what I think. I think

Speaker 5:          02:09:51       give me my hours back, five years to figure it out and

Speaker 1:          02:09:58       figure it out. Initially if I think if you watch that fox show, watch the fox show, the moon landings, it's very compelling. It's very compelling. It's a really interesting how it is real. What's saying it's not real. Um, but the odds of that being true, it's so small. It's like I don't know what haPpened, but if I had a guest would happen. I would say they went to the moon and I wOuld say when you look at some of the photos that look like they're staged and the fact that all of them were centered there very well could have been some counterfeit photos. They definitely did a little bit of that back then in nasa, there was a photo from gemini, I believe it was gemini 15, it was Michael Collins and they took a photo of him and training with these wires and this harness on and then they blacked out all the wires and the background and then use the same photo and said that he was in space.

Speaker 1:          02:10:46       Really it was doing a spacewalk like who's taking his picture that spacewalk nobody. It wasn't a real photo. There was nobody out there with the fucking cameras with photos, so we didn't know that photo. Just. They didn't think that people are gonna think that many steps ahead. So I think there it's very possible that they might have faked some things, like some photographs might have been on a soundstage or stuff there. Yeah, for publIcity and to make sure that they got a record of john kerry show those pictures of Syria above dead bodies and it was from five years ago. Dude, my favorite quote, those clinton's quote about it, clinton talks about when he was a kid, he was working for a carpenter and the guy said that he didn't believe anything on television that those television fellers can put things on tv and make you think it's real.

Speaker 1:          02:11:35       And he said, back then I thought that guy was a quack but or a crank. But during my eight years in the white house, I saw things that made me think that maybe he was ahead of his time. Well, clinton quote on the moon landing, do you think they tell each president like, here's the catch you up on the moon or do anything that I don't even tell them? Why would they want to tell them? Well, if it really was fake, which again, I don't necessarily think it was. I think it's more likely that there some fuckery involved in some of the evidence because you know, they were trying to create things that were used for publicity and there's some, some video that looks really fucking hokey. There's like, there's this video of them jumping around with. they're on trampolines when they're on the moon.

Speaker 1:          02:12:17       Yeah, it's really weird. It's really weird stuff because the, the, the, there's no consistency in the way they move. Like if you watch the earliest video from apollo 11 when they're walking on the moon, you can watch their movement and then watch the, the later stuff. It's like they move a little differently. Like they can do weird shit. Like they can jump and fly through the air, you know, later in the uh, in the, in the videos they got better at whatever they were doing to get better at walking into. Well, it's just weird. So I think that it might very well be that some of the footage that you look at, it's possible, and I'm not suggesting that we didn't go to the moon. I know I haven't passed, but what I'm suggesting is some of the footage might be fake. It's possible they used to do that kind of stuff back then.

Speaker 1:          02:13:00       I know we don't like to think that, but they did a lot of stuff, but now they still do it now they still fake things. Now it's got good boards of martin luther king with white women. Sure. MeanwHile, martin luther king fucked a lot of white women. How about that? How about he loved it? Who wouldn't your mind? Luther king. Yeah, I bet he did. So he knew he was going to die. Just a rampage. Get the white posts. What's this black girl like 5:00 PM or 2:30 AM. What does that mean? The color. Oh, like five per. This is a starter. Black.

Speaker 2:          02:13:32       okay. She wasn't, I mean for me to go in full bore. That's kinda crazy, right? She was not from this country. She was from like uh, the uh, england or lIke the or the or the. I'm sitting anglosaxon. Jamaica. Yeah. Like raised their. Yeah. Real white. Real. Not hip. Hoppy at all. Hip hop. It was a very starter, like just get in there. Was she half black now? I mean, you know, they're all black. Did you notice that man? Did the vagina seem any different to you? Any colors? Any shapes? Surprisingly similar to white posts. It was pretty shocking actually. How similarly shaped and feeling it was. What's the same? They're humans, but then it got weird which she snored and it was like a manly trouble after that.

Speaker 3:          02:14:18       No, no, no, no, no.

Speaker 2:          02:14:20       Mainly way to sleep. Watching your dick go into that pink holdout with the contrast with the black is such a coolest sight though. Like if you have a darker one when he. Because they are just bright pink inside like pink starburst. You have a darker one, medIum rare. He's not the kind of things that women want to hear. It's like a black and steak with the medium rare. Yeah, exactly. Inside. Yeah. So good for you. Thanks. I'm adding diversity to your. Exactly. Broadening my horizons. I think a lot of people would salute you for that. I'm also dating chicks a little bit too. Yeah, tHat's weird. That weird. It's hard right now to go on like full dates and like, oh, let's just try to explore you aS a person instead of like you get bored, try to get laid. It just seems like fuck the conversations you're having in my head. I'm like, come on, let's just go back and fuck. Wow. I don't say that out loud. That's what I think, but that's what you think. You don't really want to talk to them. You just want to fuck them. Yeah. So I want to get to the point where I'm like, no, let's enjoy a new human and fucking enjoy them for a minute. Trying to mature.

Speaker 3:          02:15:26       Right? To, uh, to, to find women that you actually like as people and not just as sexual partners, but if you get some just purely sexual partners, then you can do that. Then you can afford to explore with a, with a woman. That's true. Once your needs are met, which are many biologic funding. Yeah, that's a weird thing where you supposed to not be able to say that, but a woman is allowed to say that if a woman says that, you know, hey, you know, I take these men and I let them know, look, we're just here to. I'm here to fuck. Okay, I'm busy. I've got a career. You can fuck me. And then we'd done and you got to go home. You know, it's not gonna argue with the guy will be like, okay, god says, I was like, you fucking asshole. Could you imagine if there was a hot woman who ran a business or something like that and whatever. She makes fucking sculpture. She say time, but she needs to get laid. So she says, you listen, here's the deal. Okay, I like you. I think you're hot. I want to fuck, but I don't want you being my boyfriend. I don't want you hanging around. You can't sleep over and don't ever fucking tell me what to do. But if you want no strings attached, you come over and fuck me, suck your deck and

Speaker 1:          02:16:30       we'll have a good time. And then when we're done you leave. He'd be like, okay, I'll do that for you. You'd be like, yes, I knew she was out there. It's um, I was having this discussion with one of my wife's friends who happen to be gay and they were talking about, um, the difference between two gay guys like hooking up gay guys, meeting and hooking up and a guy and a girl meeting and hooking up the guy. And a girl trying to figure out how much again, are we gonna have in this. How much yann for possession. Who's gonna? Who's gonna? Be in control here. Setting it up. It's a girl. Is a girl going to tell you what to do and answer your phone for you? Or is she going to leave you alone? Let you be you. You gonna leave her alone.

Speaker 1:          02:17:15       You gotta. Let her wear whatever she wants and not get fucking weird. Were there. You know what's going to happen here? Are you going to say what are you really going to go out with that skirt you? Really good? Well done. Skirt for real. You're setting up my knees, not your fucking knees. It's not your knees, your knees. Okay, I see your legs. God. Do we really need that much attention? You know there's, there's that, there's that dude. And then there's people that like, are you a copy but you have fun. Have a good time. You know, who are you going to be and who, what? What's she going to be happiest with that early on? Also finding someone who's like brings out the best in you. Like sometimes you could have relationships that bring out the worst in you. You're like, hey, do you want to fight it initially forward leaning forward.

Speaker 8:          02:17:59       Oh, it's

Speaker 1:          02:18:01       so not necessarily for any of us to do. It's just not, you know, any of us that are involved in altercations, like so much of it as it's both people's responsibility. You know, there's a dance going on when two people communicating with each other and a lot of times we're shitty dance partner. Yeah. Sometimes I feel like telling people that look at doesn't. It's nobody's fault, but you guys are never gonna work because you just entered into this too much. You're just to fighting. Some people like it, man, that's a, that's a source of drawing their life. They don't even realize that it's completely subconscious, but they liked to duke it out. They lIke it, they liked the fucking hate it. I don't like it with anybody. I don't like it with friends. I don't like it with giRlfriends. I don't like it with anyone in business.

Speaker 1:          02:18:40       I don't like with other comics. I don't like it, man. It's nOt fun. I would way rather be friendly with everybody. Yeah, well it's way easier that way. It is way easier. It makes everybody feel nicer, but there's moments man, but you'll run into people. You're like, god dammit. I got to fucking like defend my position here. I gotta like stay afloat here. I gotta I gotta go to shut the fuck up and leave me alone. Like there's A moment where you have to like say something or be assertive with someone. Just get them to fucking leave you own it. Can just do this. People that just don't get it. They will just fuck with you until the end of time. They're just so goofy and clunky. They just don't get it. I had an argument once at a party. This guy was trying to tell me that the un rapes children in africa rapists.

Speaker 1:          02:19:23       Those. Yeah. As he was telling me that they were raped some for apples. That's what he's saying, but it was the dumbest conversation. He raped him to other people. Give them apples for like job well done. Giving them apples to fuck them. He Was saying it was like the rape them for apples. You saying it was great. The guy was just such a douche bag. He was um, he was a country music guy who wound up getting arrested for cocaine dealing. He's like a singer and it's really terrible country music band that my friend knew. Yeah. And he was like that low pro rah rah american guy, but in the most idiotic way possible. And uh, you know, he was, they were talking about the United States, what they're doing over in Afghanistan and this and that. And He was just going on about the un rape and people for apples.

Speaker 1:          02:20:09       And I was like, what the fuck are you talking about? Like what, how can you, first of all, if you give someone an apple, it's prostitution. It's not rape. Give them an app on your phone. Yeah, it's unfortunate, but it's not the best prices in the world. Rape you with an app. Unless you're fucking someone with an apple, you're not really raping them for apples unless it's a mac book pro. It's pretty good deal. Yeah. If you can get a mac book pro, fuck you guys like really good plus one techie, I'll give you this or whatever it was. It wasn't just that. It was just the way this guy was just so aggressive with me. It was just like such a point and he put his hands on me like on my shoulder and said, oh, it's okay. Like looking me in the eyes saying it's okay.

Speaker 1:          02:20:46       I understand you just hate America. I understand you're saying, oh submissive. It's just like, dude, get your fucking hands off me. Like, and that's when it turned ugly. I was like, you gotta get your fucking hands off me. Don't touch me dude. Don't touch me and talk to America. Because I questioned it. He had escalated it to not just that I hate America, but that he was going to like do some weird shit to me. I'm like, hold onto me. You know? It was really gross. That does push it up a level and somebody touches you or like, like you on the head. It was a long time ago by the way. It was a long time ago. Who knows? If I would've ever even entered into that conversation today, I don't think I would. I think today I'm much more skillful at the art of evading nonsense.

Speaker 1:          02:21:26       I would have known what it was. I was the upside. None. None. I would have known, but back then I would be like, fuck, this guy fucking touched me. You know? It was like I was ready to kill him. I, it was just, it was the most ridiculous guy ever. Like those people in your show, you'll run into the man. Oh, some of the safety people yelling, shut the fuck up. It's like, it's all unknown. It's like you didn't have to say that. Oh, the people at the comedy show. Yeah. Yeah. Well, you know, the only way to know that you shouldn't go too far is to see the results of going too far or other people when it gets to those artists. Like you could've just walked away and greg was right. Everybody is ready to fistfight.

Speaker 4:          02:22:03       Well, he's very competitive too. When I did a, doug loves movies and san diego, it was me and greg fitzsimmons and, and he took it as a game and then like, could he thought I wasn't taking it serious and if you can tell immediately like, no man, we're in a game, right?

Speaker 1:          02:22:17       Yeah, he plays good pool. They kicked me out of my apartment because let him stay at my apartment while I was in Australia. They're like, no, no, it's not so much As a friend of mine who's a place to stay, so I'm just

Speaker 3:          02:22:26       letting him stay there. Like, no, it's not allowed. I'm like, I'm going to keep doing that because my friend like, I can do that. And she left me a note if I get out how. That's ridiculous. Yeah. It wasn't an official eviction. It was just like, we suggest you leave. Why? Because I don't know. I think she had a really good hard on for people subletting or something. I don't get it. People are weird with their confrontations mean some of them are necessary, but there's guys like eddie gift. It was a perfect example. That motherfucker, every time you talk to him, he's got some new, he's got somebody else getting so we're out in the parking lot and I'm like, fuck you and fuck you and you guys want to go. Let's go right now. and I'm like, what are you talking about? Why did it get to their fighting in a parking lot and the middle of the night? Everyone, everyone's drunk. He hangs out with

Speaker 4:          02:23:06       people that are like that. Also. There's also this chris wild guy, I don't know if you know him or not. He's like fighting with tony hinchcliffe right now on this show. Like they're battling out of what? What do you mean by battling? Like they ads has, has a show talking shit or whatever it's called now and there's a guy that's always on the show called eddie if and I, chris, while tony was on the show also with this guy, didn't know him, you know, just thought it was a friend of his. And then guess what happened is like the wild guy who was like kind of mad that he, tony didn't know who he was or kind of like upset or something, and then they kind of went back and forth on the show. But now I guess he's just chris wild won't let it drop and has been like tweeting a things to tony and stuff and just, I don't know if, you know, chris wilder and I used to have a tv.

Speaker 3:          02:23:52       I dunno what the fuck happened. I can't really comment. I don't know what the specifics of it were but. But I'm on team. Tony hinchcliffe always over there. That's rosa parks on that. So it's a parks yamaka. Um, I don't think that's a yamaka kid. She's the one that lights can. Jimi hendrix was like that. As light as you're fucked, you're fucked. It's hard to tell. In That photo I went a little darker. The black and white photo. So is the hendrix photos, black and white photo. That's toronto. He got busted for heroine. Son had hail when I went to visit his, his childhood home in vancouver at a small shrine to him. Really? Yeah. Jeff ross. A big focus on what they were near. That's not to data at 27, 28 years old. Was he 27 and 28, 27, 27 years old. He's got a shrine.

Speaker 3:          02:24:38       You. Where's your trying bitch? I don't have a shrine. How can we get in the shrine and. Good question. That's a good question. That should be a goal. A lot of people want to engage. A specialist should have a fucking strong and fierce shrine already. The great was born here or the already the great is born from the mediocrity of his mother's pussy right here. Just make my own stride. the hospital, whatever. Right. It like if you ever read someone's bio on their website, you know, they wrote it themselves and makes you a fucking up their lives in a part of like near Washington dc where people have historic houses things and he just made one up. I made up of historic house. It was like a stop on the underground railroad or something like that. you just made it up. Did he apply for it? Like, it made it a real?

Speaker 1:          02:25:24       Uh, I don't know exactly how he did it. If he wants the city, I'm like, this happened here. So if we could get a plaque or if you just bought a plaque and stuck it there. Oh, okay. Probably mostly bought a prac. Right. It would be really hard to pass that through city though. Tell them like. Yeah, they'd be like, we ain't even know unless you really super. Yeah. It was like some writer stayed here when he was visiting. Well, there's probably a bunch of places that do kind of qualify for that. Like for instance, like Stephen King has a house in Maine, in bangor, Maine. And like that house should be a historical house in my setting up there. Just that, like that was his house for so long and it's like he's got these wrought iron gates that have these bats on them and shit.

Speaker 1:          02:26:04       Really dope ass house and it's in the middle of this town of bangor, Maine. And everybody knew about it and he's such a legendary writer that that house, to me, It's like, that's like an iconic house. So you'd put like a historic. Yeah, make it, make it a fucking museum for Stephen King fans can come in and see. This is the desk that he actually wrote. You know, some of his novels that I love those little museums across the country. I'll tell you man, if they did that, they would pay for that house a dozen times over. Just let people go and see. Fuck. Yeah, I would, I would, I would pay if I was in boston and I knew could fly up and just check out the desk where Stephen King wrote the shining. Fuck you. I would look at that thing I want. I just want to be in the room.

Speaker 1:          02:26:45       ThIs is where he wrote cujo and he didn't remember it. Soak it a. Yeah. This is where you fit so much coke and drank so much booze. He didn't even remember writing. Stephen king did dinner to coke. Oh my god. Did he do coke? Stephen king was a maniac. Became wIthout cigarettes to massive amounts of coke and drink beer and he would drink like 16, 17 beers at night and just write until he blacked out and then fall asleep and they'd get up in the morning, coke it up and just do it again. Yeah, he was a maniac. wow. Joe frothing at the mouth. He doesn't remember any of it. It was all him. He was cujo who knows. I mean, I'm sure there were some analogies in there somewhere between a lot of his demons and the demons he was experiencing by being an addict, but he was getting addicted to.

Speaker 1:          02:27:30       I heard his own writing or whatever the book is. Great. It's great. Yeah. I've got two copies of it and realize one. Oh wow. Yeah, it's really good. It's really good. It's, it's, he's an, he's a master to me, you know, and uh, a master a of a specific type of genre was him. Well, it's a specific type of entertainment that I really enjoy, like complete fantasy vampires and demons and spaceships with aliens. And I loved that shit. I love stories. Yeah. I love all that stuff. I'm a huge, huge Stephen King fan to me. He's like, he made the World a cooler place. he made the world a place with the movie. Carrie, you know, with the book carry with christine. That movie about the haunted car. That was a fucking great movie, man. He wrote that book too, which is even better than the movie. You know, christine was. A lot of them were. Oh, he was. The books are too long. There's too much detail. Too much. You would like to have seen it all in the movie, but it's impossible. The movie's got to be two hours.

Speaker 3:          02:28:28       I got a lot of shitty acts. A lot of those movies though, like salem's lot. Yeah, a lot of life. Let's just do this for 40 grand. Yeah. Well those I think was lot was for television. I think that was made for television. Was it? That was, was it sam flatmates for television? I think it was. Um, then there was the silver bullet movie, the silly werewolf corey haim member. But then he also wrote fucking stand by me. Yeah. Which is so out of his genre. Yeah. Yeah. Now he could write anything, man, he could write anything. He's a bad motherfucker dude. Then he followed those, uh, those, uh, a minor, not minor league, cub scout baseball players. What are they called? It's a little little leagues. He followed one, like started writing articles with them and they went all the way to the little league world series while he was following them, writing about them. Oh, I didn't like the bangor Maine team. Went to the nationals or something like that. He was like writing their local paper about them. Yeah. Just follow them along that season. Crazy. Yeah. Well it must be awesome for those guys. Well, he can do whatever he wants. He can do whatever he wants and he didn't have to apologize to anything to anybody.

Speaker 1:          02:29:32       Yeah. He's an interesting cat. Stephen king for sure. And he's really like giving in the way he communicates, like his ideas have him on your podcast. I would love to. I would love to. he's interesting in the way he communicates a, you know how he goes through his process. He's super honest about it and he's one of the rare guys that doesn't have like a setup like story in his head. He like has these characters and he has this idea that he starts with and they just goes, starts writing, it just starts writing, almost like goes into this crazy transcend and, and constructs this world and then you get sucked into it and then you read it after he's done with and you're like, holy shit, you know, he just brings it out of nowhere. It's not like, like we had scott sigler on the podcast.

Speaker 1:          02:30:15       It was a really cool guy and a very, very good writer as well, but he has a totally different approach. It's got sick, was approach is he knows exactly where he's going. He knows where it's going to end, he knows where this is going to happen and get changed up. He knows this and has to just sort of fill it in and figure it out. Flesh it out. Yeah. And you know, make it to his liking. but he, he's very systematic about it and we were talking about stephen king's approach that he just lets it go and that guy, you know, I just don't do it that way. I couldn't do it that way. But for him obviously it worked. But for cyclers, a great writer to be in his way works too. There's no right or wrong way to do it. Do you write like that to you? Like say I want to write a joke about driving a car? No,

Speaker 3:          02:30:55       I'll toss things over my head. I'll write a note in my notebook and then like when I looked to see what jokes I should do on stage tonight or whatever, I'll keep passing that note. I'm gonna keep thinking about it and then when I'm driving or when I'm on the subway, all I keep thinking it over and then I'll just like do it on stage. So you don't actually sit in front of the computer. How come? You know, do you try that? I've never, I've never, I've tried it, I've done it before but it's never really stuck. I just kinda think things out in my head. I just let my mind wander. I think

Speaker 1:          02:31:19       you should write blogs. You would have some fucking hilarious blogs, dude, and it gives you. The thing about writing blogs is it gives you like an opportunity to spend a lot of time thinking about a subject because in the time that it takes you to write it and type it out, you have to figure a lot more. You're thInking a lot more and you're thinking a lot more in the containment of a particular subject. So you actually do the thinking. Yes. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's forcing you to focus on one particular subject to and sometimes just that extra focus is all you need to get that extra path. You take off that bit. Like, you know, sometimes you find a bit like, I don't know if it's this way for you, but for me it is. At least I'll have an initial direction. And then along the way I realized that's not the right direction.

Speaker 1:          02:32:00       The right direction is one of the other taglines and then I'll go, yeah, totally, totally turns it on its head. I find that those take place more when I sit down and write things like really right thing. Yeah. Because I give myself more, more paths, like say if you're talking about, um, lava lamps, whatever, and you're going on a lava lamp path when while you're on that path and you're writing it out, instead of just thinking about it in your head, when you're forced to actually mash those keys and form a sentence in the correct way, like you're going to read it to somebody, you know. Oh, that [inaudible]. yeah, that's pretty dope. What's that? It's a writing software program. Has, I can't see it. Can't see it. It's a corkboard with index cards on it, but a virtual corkboard and You can put your notes on those virtual corkboards good.

Speaker 1:          02:32:51       Evernote sucks. There's some. Yeah, every. Well, I like evernoTe because they don't lose stuff for me to lose stuff. Really. I've looked at. It's been written about it loose stuff for you to really, you know, you've been. It's been written about online, you know? Ooh, that's not good. Yeah. Anyway, yeah. I think more people would benefit from blogs. That's why I've written some of my best stuff. So I'm, I'm, uh, gonna start going back into blogs. I'm going to commit to a one blog a week. Really? Yeah. And then what? You won't mind doing material out of your blogs? Nope. I don't mind doing that because it becomes an idea like it's an idea and the blog and then it becomes a bit full thing. well it's either that or you don't get the blocks. I think people like to read things and I think that some of them are never going to go to see my standup or friends will get to see the germination.

Speaker 1:          02:33:41       And if You don't like it, that's okay. I get it. I mean I've heard people complain about subjects that we talk about on the podcasts that eventually what's on your mind. The problem is that's what's on your mind. So I'm going to do with on stage what's on my mind. It's also the problem that some people are just annoying concept, like to complain about shit and they get to talk to everybody gets to talk. You know, it's one of the beautiful things about the internet and one of the annoying things about the internet, it, even people that are not thoughtful, that are all fucked up and really, you know, very hypercritical and annoying and not rational about it. They get to talk to, you know, there's a guy who was a, he was a vIdeo game guy that just quit social meeting, quit his twitter now what's cliff epa.

Speaker 1:          02:34:23       It was another guy, he, he's like a famous for making youtube videos and there was this thing that they were going over his career and uh, hIs, his constant battling with people on these social network sites. And when people would say mean things about him, he couldn't help it. he thought to respond or get involved in these crazy fights. And then he had started having his employees handle his treater for him and that relieved them of as a little bit of a. So then he got to a point where it's like, I'm, I can't fucking do it anymore. Like, I'm going crazy. I'm like real health problems and the stress of this, you know, um, when you start looking for that shit and reading that shit and getting into that shit, it can fuck with your head man. If you, if you do something that people don't like and they all start attacking you for it, attacking you as a human being and trying to like hurt your feelings.

Speaker 1:          02:35:08       It's not just one. There's like 20 of them in a day. What was that about though? What is, what about, what did those people doing that. Why did you say that? Oh, because this guy did that. He quit. He quit as a social media to get away from it. Yeah. I just couldn't take it anymore. I mean he makes his living off his youtube channel. He's this huge youtube channel, like people like millions and millions of subscribers and he's got a huge, huge twitter following. Hundred thousand twitter people deleted it all. Yeah, because he just couldn't take it anymore. I know it is his life, but it's interesting like that, that battle, you know, with the criticism and negative people online, like I released that I released that I was worried, but I released my album online with, with commentary. I put it on my podcast while we word well because I was worried that someone would say the only word.

Speaker 1:          02:35:54       It was like someone's going to say like, oh, this just lazy because he didn't want to do another podcast episode this week and the first comment was lazy motherfucker, but that was the only one. But It was like the first one. I was like, god damn it. You can't listen to those people. Those people are shitheads. Yeah, no, you can't tell me that. Somebody tells me like, oh, I saw this joke last time, or whatever. It's like, it just bothers me. Well, do you need to let them know, look, I'm working on jokes and the only way to work on jokes and you've got to do it more than once. A bit is never finished unless it's done 20, 30, 50, depending on the bed. It's got to be done. A lot of times you have to do it onstage and perform it and tweak it and move it around and if you think that like, you know, you'd go to see me in this town, then you go to see me in another town and it's going to be a totally different act a month later and some possible crazy.

Speaker 1:          02:36:40       I need to work on that stuff. Like a lot of my stuff that I've released in the past, I wish I'd worked on it more. I wish I'd spent more time going over it, but that requires new people will come. I go, well, it also requires you have to do it on stage. Know I had everlast on the podcast yesterday. We were talking about the difference between writing a song and writing a joke. Like I've never made a joke without the help of other people because every joke I made, it has to be done in front of an audience and they let me know what's working. It's A combined effort. It just is. I can't. I mean I'll write some good ideas that will work. The first time I get on stage, but they get better when you do them in front of an audience and you figure them out and you gotta take chances.

Speaker 1:          02:37:19       You've got to do them this way and you gotta move the punchlines changing. Look at order real quick. Let me examine each of these a bunch of different ways. You never know man. Sometimes you nail one and it's just the perfect way to say you can't believe you used to say it another way before. Pause, right at some sock. Man. You know chris rock famously talks about his, one of his greatest bits of all time and you know the bit that I love black people and I hate niggers. Remember that bit one of the. That's one of the all time. you certainly did, but it's one of the all time classic comedy bits. It's just a brilliant bit. Well, he said that that been bombed. Louis ck told me this. He said that the bit bombed for like a year. Really couldn't get it to work. Right. And then finally he figured out how to get it right.

Speaker 1:          02:38:04       If you could just figure it out how to do it right, but he believed in it. He believed in the premise, so he chased the premise down until it got to a point where it was just a weapon and then when by the time it was on a special, it's just flawless. That bit, that bit so classic. It's a legendary but legendary, but that's a perfect example of like legacy book can't do that. if you want to hear the same jokes every week, same with rather than wondering to new jokes every show because you're never going to get to that level. It was really great doing going in New York where do four, five, six spots a night and if you work on one bit and you do want to go get that feeling of like, oh, there's a little bit in the middle. There wasn't enough laps, but then usually I wait 24 hours before talking about and I sort of forget this time it's 40 minutes later I'm doing it again.

Speaker 1:          02:38:48       I'm like, oh, it's still weak in the middle there. So then on the subway I'm like, I gotta write something and then you don't still weak in the middle of the next thing you do when you're like, well that was okay, maybe that'll work. You try something else and by the end of the night you'd like, I've, I've fixed this up a little bit. [inaudible], you know, it was almost like a dilapidated house and you're like, I've done some work on it now. Sometimes when I'm in a bit that's not really working, I try to think of myself like when I'm writing, especially I try to think of myself as instead of making a bit, instead of trying to turn it and figure out a way to make a bit, just figuring out a way to just express what's going on and what you're talking about, what is actually going on at a bunch of shit to it.

Speaker 1:          02:39:23       That's not necessarily the writing aspect of it. Like write a bunch of Shit out. Talk about the whole thing, read whatever the subject of the building or whatever. What emotions you were having. Describe how embarrassed you fell. Describe why you were embarrassed to add a bunch of shit, you know you're never going to say on stage a bunch of shit, like go way too far and then look at it and go and just start cherry picking and then go, oh, but this, this makes sense. If I can cut that out and go right to this and you'll somEtimes you just give yourself more by going too far back. The teacher would tell us that like if people weren't going to even close to far enough, that bloke was your cheat on me. He was like, you're not, you're not going far enough. Like I'm pretty upset. Like it doesn't look like that. And he would alwaYs go, just do it like 10 times too much. Just for argument's sake, let me just see that. And then people would do it. He goes, okay, pull that back. Like, like three percent. Like you're just barely over the line. That's where you should be.

Speaker 3:          02:40:14       You got to take chances and people don't want to take chances. And that's one of the things that is the hallmark of bad acting. I don't really want to dive into and become someone else. They're still clinging onto who they are. What are you talking about? You're not even going in there. They don't even know how to be noticed. Freddy would do that when he would really do is dad getting exasperated. He would lift his hand all the way up over his head like at that, and you'll see the new upper makers trying something similar. They're hammered comments about their side. They'd be like, oh, well, you're doing that. You just didn't have the guts to stick with it to just go for it. This is a commitment because it's so foolish if you fail like that. Oh yeah, there was way more foolish. Oh, we've all done that.

Speaker 3:          02:40:51       We've over committed to bits and tried to pump them up and they're just dumb shit. You know that feeling, brian? You know what I'm talking about. When you get in the middle of a bit and you're really working it and you're like, oh my god, I can't even get out of this bit. It's usually the dolphin one. When people start going like women get disgusted about it or something. Yeah. At the dolphin. I'm sorry, the stripper one. Oh, that's even more. Yeah. Well what are they going to do every. It's not for everybody. Some people like bluegrass succeeds that stories like 10 minutes long. Like once you start to realize a whole crowd is not that intuitive, you're like, oh, I really should've stopped. Well, I found a way out of it that lately. Yeah, that's sometimes important. Part of like not doing well with a bit too, is that it shows other.

Speaker 3:          02:41:35       Yeah. Well also I like doing it for crowd. I'd like to, in bits for crowds, I'm mixed between either putting on the best show or doing bits that I think this crowd won't like to see if I can make it work here. You know what I mean? It's a real dark joke and there's a real conservative crowd. I could do my more conservative jokes, but it's sort of rather work on this in front of these people work in this really harsh thing in front of these people. That's why I like going to Australia and Switzerland, amsterdam doing shows and other countries like I want to know what parts of these really work in different environments. Wow. You know, a comedy on state has like a thursday night, like college night, so it's all college students, you know, 250 of them. So it's like. Yeah, let me see how they relate to this.

Speaker 3:          02:42:11       Right. College kids are a different thing man, because when you do like colleges, one of the things that you realized almost immediately is how little experience a lot of them have in life. Like a lot of them are coming from their parents houses, protected environments of their whole dorm to a dorm with a bunch of savage hormonally charged. Ten is just sticking things inside their parties all day, whether it's needles or dicks or just she just fucking and doing drugs and getting crazy. I mean people are getting crazy. You remember how much fucking you did when you were in college? Zero. Oh no, it barely won. He didn't do any fucking. Oh, that's right. You were a virgin religiously for religious purposes. But then I dropped the religion is still was just waiting for the right girl, the right girl to love kate hicks. I saw that you added that to your phone.

Speaker 3:          02:43:00       Your email list is that if I said I had to tell her revenue email address, I said, if I haven't talked to him all the time, we're enemies. Don't take this as a sign. You just get in touch with me again unless you go. Do you know where she is now? In baltimore somewhere? Yeah. Yeah. Do your friends or facebook? No, she won't be friends with me on that either. She's doing. She can't get the archduke anymore. She's terrified. She the one that got away crying. It was like five that got away. Thinking about the red. Yeah. Yeah, there's. I got away every time. The one that always got away. I mean, I definitely got dumped. I've definitely been dumped, but when I got dumped, I got away. I realized after I go, wow, thank god, but I was a maniac too. Don't get me wrong.

Speaker 3:          02:43:46       They got away as well. It's not like either one of us wasn't good. I love what you can both look back and be like, yeah, what were you doing? Wow, got to be careful though, so wrong for you. Wrong for me. You'll get into that situation where you think you know, like, wow, maybe we were meant together. Now we've gone through our bullshit and I try to do that once. Right? because you're just comfortable. Girlfriend. When I was a teenager we met when I was 25 and we went on a date in New York and had a good time and went back and got a little of that in there and I was like, wow, maybe she's the one. Holy shit. She's the one. Yeah. So much. Two days it was a wreck. Maybe she's the one he said I think like, well that's another thing, one date when you're young and single and you try to like hang out for a weekend with someone that you barely know and like a day in where you like, will you shut the fuck up?

Speaker 3:          02:44:34       Like what kind of craziness are you talking? And you realize like what kind of nonsense people talk amongst their friends and then get stuck in the middle of it squawking at you already. Have You met anyone off of tinder yet? What? Girl? Melbourne. I hooked up with. She's not supposed to tell that fucking kiss and tell cock sucker. Or was melbourne going to know many people they know fucked are in melbourne. I'm tired. No, I like to know more than anything more than. Because I went on one date in New York and we were like made out and that was it. And then another date we didn't do anything but like it's nice to be able to reject girls are kind of out of your league just to be like, nah, no thanks. Yeah. Well you're just saying yes or no to all these girls. Are they putting their best pictures up?

Speaker 3:          02:45:19       You feel like your life has gone up. Wow. Because You're like, why would I take this seven and a half when I could tell. Just took two nights. And you don't have to get the match with any of them. What are we doing to humans? We devaluing them with no numbers on a, on an iphone app. I don't know if it's setting us free. Well, I think it's definitely a vital norms that aren't really us. DEfinitely setting a lot of people free from the, uh, the difficulty in getting laid. I saw two hippos. Fucking the zoo being simone and pizza. Tinder did not meet on tinder. It was the base level of it. It's like that old joke you add with the, uh, with the lions tigers though. Like, no. Like, oh, I wonder if my pilot is going. None of that. Just fucking. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          02:45:59       That's what tinder is like that you like me, I like you like each other looks. Let's do this. Well, I think one of the things that's kept people from being more sexually liberated is that people cling when there's a shortage on when it's difficult to get sex. People cling to each other when it's difficult to find partners, difficult to find lovers and people that you enjoy being with. It's hard to meet people when you find people, they get together and they get married real early. But when people get older, instead of playing musical chairs, just grabbing onto the first chair and hang on and you get us something like a tinder or one of those little dating websites or the books. Yeah, you can just meet a bunch of new people and then find who you actually like and then he realized they're just meeting a bunch of people too and everybody's just meat and it's easy to hear. To me, it's like first day at dining hall of the fucking college. Hi, how are you? Yeah. And if it becomes not hard to get a date that that's limited limits. A lot of obviously changed his life really. He said because he was the one thing is worried about most of the rejection of natural fearman, but this takes that out. They've already said, hey, I'm interested. Wow, that's interesting. That's great. Great idea. That's a great application. I just met this girl

Speaker 4:          02:47:05       on on tinder and she's like, she's like, ah. I told her my name. Eventually I was like, I might said, well online, it's brian red band. And she goes, that's weird. My last name is band and I'm like, what? That's crazy. And then, and then uh, then she, uh, she had come to the comedy store with Bobby Lee. Bobby lee met his girl on tinder, brought this girl with her and I was like, wait, I remember I was like staring you down the whole time. And then I found a picture on comedy store's website of her, of the whole patio that night, like they took a picture of you. Right? And I'm staring right at her and she's staring right at me.

Speaker 9:          02:47:37       It's definitely working. Her last name

Speaker 3:          02:47:45       band? No, isn't that weird? Crazy. Do it with her now. I've even met her yet. We're hurry. Come on man. How dare you? How dare you? It's hard for me to meet people often wonder because it's a very weird situation. Even once you said the first move, I was like, hi, I'm so we might want to. We might want to talk to each other. Yeah, it gets tricky. It gets real tricky. You got to think about what you're doing, getting together. It gets real tricky when you show up and you're like, there were about 30 pounds at weren't represented in those photos. What do you do that you Just enjoy the date and then you get at some point you're like, you know what? I don't want it to look sexy. Whoa. Ari shaffir.

Speaker 4:          02:48:23       That's why you got to do some research Before you go. You take a screenshot of it, cut out the picture, upload it to google image search and I'll show you her face.

Speaker 3:          02:48:29       Ah, god, brian. Too crafty. She's like, just

Speaker 4:          02:48:36       found out. This girl that I met a. She has a podcast on a podcast network. I'm not. I don't know if I should tell her not because we've been talking back and forth. I was like, it.

Speaker 3:          02:48:44       What the fuck? This is something wrong with her having a podcast. Yeah. I just don't like the network. So was lumber party with allie and Georgia. Let all this shit go. Don't, don't tell people online who it is. You fucking knucklehead and you want to ruin your life already. Elliot george, you learn how to keep secrets. You fuck. I'm not going to. Probably never meet this girl. Oh, but you might, you might, it might become besties. I've is. Yeah, man, you know, I, I really resent that idea that what other podcasters have to, uh, be, uh, we have to be against each other. We have to, to them not even talking about your situation, but when the stitcher awards came out, we won best overall podcast. Congratulations.

Speaker 3:          02:49:29       But what I was shocked by was like one of the other fucking podcast. Some I've never even heard of them. It might be the nicest guys ever, but their, uh, their sound guy or something and instigated some fucking hate campaign against us. Like, yeah, to tweet me and say a bunch of mean shit to me. It was like a swarm of it. And I was like, wow, this is hilarious. Like, look, guess what? You know you can fucking light whatever podcast you want. You don't have to be mean to the people that other people like, like who gives a shit? Like your podcast, your podcast can't be that good if that's the way you think. If you really think that way, your podcast has got to be filled with some nonsense. Like what David Cross hated larry the cable guy. David cross's starting that with garbage.

Speaker 3:          02:50:08       Yeah. That didn't work out so well. That was a ridiculous thing. Like, like, come on man. You know what he's doing? He's doing a character like the idea that this character is like locals. What do you care? It's ruining the fabric of society because it's already done. Yeah. That was the argument about larry. The cable guy's racist. Really? Yeah. That was a big part of it. This zenith phobic fear of foreigners towel head talk, you know, that kind of shit. I don't know, man. Just other shit to be worried about in this world. You know that that weird thing where people get mad at other people for Being successful or get mad at other people for winning an award or get mad at other people for producing that you haven't produced to tell it. You want to piss the common golf. Oddly telling me that he's your second favorite comic book.

Speaker 3:          02:50:52       I'm still really good if all the convenience is better. Yeah. That's so true. Well, we're all fucked up in some way, you know, or at least we come into it fucked up and hopefully we balance out somewhere along the trip going to piss off a girl. Here's what you do. He'd say, color. Say close your eyes and come outside right now and then watch how disappointed they'll get because women think they just deserve free things. Just assume you've got to have a president that's not nice fear. These are terrible ideas. You've got to vet these out with me. Call me up. Next time you think about doing something like that, what are you going to do? what? What's the benefit of that? I just got to laugh. Ha ha. You get nothing. You get nothing but dick. You want some dick? You don't. Somebody else does. I get tender. Look at my phone. Fuck you. I'm free. Free dinners. Where at every high schooler has one. So what's that? Every high school and I was one a 10, but tinder, I'm sure they do. They're going on. They're on. They're on a goddamn rampage. Kids today are fucking with an ease that we've never experienced before. That's why it's good that they have that, a hpv vaccination, they can shoot that in them and then they can shoot loads of

Speaker 1:          02:52:06       each other and not worry anyone under 26. Right? Something like that. Anybody young, uh, they're to have sex should get that vaccine. Oh yeah, shit's bad that he hpv. But that vaccine apparently with some folks this had given them adverse reactions. There's a bunch of, what I don't know. Some people, you know, it's like any other medication, some people just don't know. They just get sick. Some people get sick from it. These vaccinations, a tricky, you know, shandra is um, dad got lyme disease from a, um, from a lot they had a vaccination for lyme disease, but for a small percentage of the population that have a particular gene set up, they would get lyme disease from the vaccination. Wow. That's fucked up. The poor guy got lyme disease from a vaccination for lyme disease. It wasn't a lot of people that got that, but was enough that they pulled it from the market.

Speaker 1:          02:52:54       What's going on in Venezuela right now? Yup. It's crazy, right? It's crazy. Right? Time. Early in the world, millions of people on the street protesting against their government all over the world. [inaudible] put up some pictures. The Ukraine also believe that they are to Venezuela is not his people. How dare you? Well, they're just tired of this. A fucking really shitty setup that they have and a lot of these countries quit cheating us wrong what we want for once. Yeah, you. You actually don't own us. You don't have power over us. We allow you, we elect you to positions of control. Elect you. You don't. You don't tell us what to do. We tell you that you have power to do things, but the system is so corrupt though. It's Like that. You can't do apply any leaders in there. It'll always be corrupted. Not everyone man, but most system will get mad.

Speaker 1:          02:53:40       I think will also, I think people until today, until this year, people have been. I mean, until this age, I should say, the age of the internet, people have been able to get away with shit and not get in trouble with it and not have the word spread across the country with ronald reagan. I'd have no recollection of that. This is like the of it right now. It's turned to this buyer versus a cost versus citizens. Yeah. Oh my god. That's terrifying. This is a movie man. Shots going off light, but know what? Otherwise, wow. Look at this shit. This is crazy. This is live right now. Venezuela is a fucking. The writing. They are turning against our government. Imagine if you were living in Venezuela right now. This is the apocalypse. They have regular meetings on fire guys. This is the chicago. In 20 years, everything's on fire and guns are going off and this is the government trying to keep control of its citizens because they're [inaudible].

Speaker 1:          02:54:31       They're protested and said, no, no pro. They outlaw protests, protests. You can't outlaw protests. He fucks and I start getting violent because I just want to say, don't do this. Yeah, well they're. They're living under a totalitarian, dictator's block and twitter feed. If You post pictures on twitter that blocking a lot of them. Yeah, it's terrifying shit, man. You know what? All these monarchs and all these kings and all these people that run countries are terrified of this kind of shit happening. All these prime ministers or whatever their title is, people in positions of power call them whatever the fuck that was,

Speaker 3:          02:55:04       but you see that all these people are terrified of losing this. They're terrified of losing their ability control to control these people and they get used to that feeling of power. They feel like they deserve it the same way we were talking about earlier, like ridiculous. Celebrities think that everyone is supposed to kiss their ass because they don't look at themselves. These people don't look at themselves either. Just dominate these people. People who support America going into like Syria or something like that and they're like, well, we got to do something, and my thought is if there were dirty dishes in the dish in the sink, you don't send a spastic toddler in there to watch it because they'll smash a bunch of dishes and you're be like, well, we can't just leave the dishes dirty like, well, we to send in somebody like that toddler is the wrong guy to sit in.

Speaker 3:          02:55:44       America is proven to have just no, there's no death, but who else would you send in if you're going to get rid of? Literally not the ones we just spread death to every country we go into. Yeah, but if you want to. Okay, look, I'm not. I don't buy the what's going on in Syria. I don't buy us that we need to invade Syria. I think it's a very complicated, gigantic mess, but if you're going to say that someone needed to invade, Syria will tell you. Would it be except us. The only superpower in the. We've only made more suffering and death everywhere else we've gone. We're getting better at it already. Okay. It takes like a joke. It takes a lot of practice. You gotta keep dominating worlds for a long time before you get it right to point. You can be really nice while you're doing it. I'm doing a piece
