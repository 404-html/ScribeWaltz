Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Usually I have it, but it goes away after a month or so. I've had it for like four months. Pretty solid. Ooh. And we live Cam Haynes. Hey Dude, buddy. I'm good. How are you? I'm good. Welcome to California. I know. And that this place is amazing. It's pretty bad ass, right? Yeah, we did the, we did the grand tour and I'm ready to lift. Yeah, we're gonna. We're going to shoot first and I don't want you, you want to have poor accuracy. No, you're, you're whole motto of run, lift. Shoot. Shouldn't be chute lift, run or shoot, run, lift. I Dunno. Do you, do you, you've run in the mornings and then you run at night too, right? Yeah. You have a problem. Yeah. Yeah. That's a problem. Yeah. That's too much. Well, I just fell back on that. Moderation is for cowards. So that like pretty much covers any psycho over doing in excess.

Speaker 1:          00:00:51       I'm like just, he can be like, no, I'm just not a coward. And what about overtraining? Is that bullshit? Yeah. Yeah. It's totally bullshit. But you were saying before, that's when you were 20. You're 50 now, but when you were 20, you could never do what you can do now when you're 50 now. So if you tried to do what you do now at 50 when you were 20, wouldn't it be overtraining? I'm confused. Well, I mean, if you weren't in shape enough, obviously you're in great shape. Could you do this all the time? But if you weren't sure

Speaker 2:          00:01:19       and you tried to keep this up like what you're doing right now? Yeah, no, I, I feel, I dunno. I feel good. Who was here? Jamie? Somebody just walked in delivery. Oh, okay. Um, so when you were 20, did you do anything? Um, I mean, I've always been active. Right. You know, I always played sports and ran at 10 k in the summers and things like that. So just worked out a little or something. Yeah. Yeah. I just wanted to lift a little bit, but not to the level I'm at now. Yeah. Well, when I look at your instagram, I get tired. Yeah, I do. Because you're doing all that shit, especially that shit. You're dealing with a outlaw strength. Yeah. Eric. Eric, yeah. Yeah. I lost trength on instagram. You guys are doing ridiculous amounts of reps. Yeah, we do. It's, it's all about the reps and it's like, uh, I dunno.

Speaker 2:          00:02:10       And like I say, your body gets used to what you ask of it. You know? If I would have tried to do that exact same thing when I was young, no way. I mean, it'd be probably be so sore. I couldn't do anything for a week. Yeah, that's what I was thinking. Also when I was looking at, I was like, if you stopped doing this, how long will it take before it slides off a one day? Because when I don't work out for one day, I'm skinny, fat and weak. How might no for real? Like how many days, what's the longest you've ever taken off? Oh, probably hunting. Oh, okay. If I'm at home, I don't, I would never take any time off. But when I'm hunting, because that's what I'm, you know, therefore. Right. But when you're hunting, at least you're hiking a lot of physical activity and there's a lot going on there. But I want to watch your videos, those instagram videos of you guys. Okay. We're going to do a hundred reps of dog to do a hundred reps

Speaker 3:          00:03:00       of that. Yeah. Cause right now I told you I'm suffering through this little tendinitis things I've been trying to fight off. I saw, I see all those reps and my elbow starts hurting when I'm looking at the screen.

Speaker 4:          00:03:09       Yeah. You know, people ask me about, my joints are about, you know, cause they're battling different things like that. And I have no idea. I mean I just, I don't have, I've been lucky where I don't have injuries. You know? I mean that's very disappointing. Yeah. I mean I, you know, my banged up a little bit, but um, you know, I've talked to you before where I've had to take an advil every day and I'm not anymore.

Speaker 3:          00:03:36       Well w tell that story because that's a crazy story and I've talked about it on the podcast without you being here, but I called you after Rhonda. Patrick did a podcast with me and she was telling me about the dangers of what they call nonsteroidal antiinflammatories. That's what I can profane is right. And she was saying it, it ruins your gut biome and then it actually causes inflammation. And so that people that are taking advil every day for inflammation don't even realize that taking all that advil actually is causing inflammation. Right? Yeah. So you quit.

Speaker 4:          00:04:07       I quit. And uh, then I wasn't, and I almost think it was maybe placebo a little bit because it's like not only did it not help after a while, but it made it worse, essentially the inflammation. So after hearing that, and you know, who's ever going to question Rhonda Patrick, and I would never, so I'm like, well, I'd better stop that. So, um, since then I haven't been taking anything. And then I have taken, there's this, there's this, you can get at the health food store. It's called Kratom. Oh yeah. You ever heard of that? Yeah. That, that seems to help.

Speaker 3:          00:04:41       You know, they're trying to outlaw that stuff. Yeah. Yeah. Apparently that's that Kratom stuff. I had Chris Bell on the podcast, he's doing a documentary about Kratom and he did that documentary bigger, stronger, faster. And yeah, I know who he is. He brought in some guys that sell Kratom and they were explaining what it does. And I tried it and when I tried it, apparently if you take it in low doses, it's like almost a mild stimulant, which is what it felt like to me. But if you take it in higher doses, it relaxes you and it's really good for pain. And Chris has had a hip replacements. What'd he say about it? Was a positive or not positive? There's no negative. There's no downsides to it. It's not addictive. It's not bad for you. It's a, it's an herb. It's not toxic at all. Right. So that's, I mean if it, so of course the government's trying to make it illegal. Oh, I, you can't have stuff out there that actually helps. Yeah. They're trying to label it with fucking heroin and shit and it's just, they're so crazy.

Speaker 4:          00:05:37       Yeah. Yeah. No, it's a, but I think that's helped. But other than that, I don't take any, I mean nothing and I feel great.

Speaker 3:          00:05:46       That's crazy. That's amazing. So when you're doing all these reps, like, so you do and you, you do these crazy things on like the lat pull down machine where you, you do the whole stack, right? The goal

Speaker 5:          00:05:58       is 20 of the stack of everything. That's fucking ridiculous. So how do you not get like joint pain that doesn't have anything? No. So just because you do it all the time, I'm not sure. Addition to it. I can't make me want to do it. I know it's, but I don't want people to, uh, I mean it's taken a while to work up there. Right. So, I mean, I, I don't want people to go and try to do that right out of the gate and then get hurt because that's what I think that's what frustrates people more than anything is when they're excited to make a change of lifestyle change and then they, something happens and then, you know, they get hurt. Yeah. I was doing chin ups, um, three or four times a week I decided I was going to do 50 chin ups, uh, at least three or four times a week.

Speaker 5:          00:06:40       Just, just make sure I did them all the time. And then on top of that I was doing heavy cleans, 90 pound cleans with kettlebells, cleans and presses. I started getting this whole nagging elbow pain. Yeah. And I didn't want to be a pussy, so I kept working out through it. Yeah. It would be fine. Like, um, during the workout it'd be fine. Like it would start to hurt at the beginning of the workout, but then once the blood would get flown, then it would be fine. And then after a couple of weeks of that, it my, my arms like, Hey, fuck head. Yeah, this is enough of this. Yeah. Cleans their tough though, you know, things are hard. I mean, I, I know, I know what I can get away with. Um, I don't do dead lifts, you know, I used to do dead lifts. I used to do all this stuff.

Speaker 5:          00:07:22       Now I'm like, you know, even though I want to do, I want to maybe every once in a while tried dead lift and cause I know it feels good. I mean my hamstrings feel good, my back feels strong when you're all, everything works right. But I just know that it's just, it's just not smart because there's a high possibility that the chick, you go sell something, something gets tweaked in the bottom and then you know, it's one side and then it's, you know, I feel it down my leg and I'm like not, I don't want to be that. You're taking that hundred 30 pound rock and throw it in a backpack. Going up mountains with that. You still doing that? No, it's gone. My rocks gone. What happened? The Rock, I don't know. Somebody stole it I guess so you will even in the same spot, roller it off the side of the mountain.

Speaker 5:          00:08:02       There's some due to probably jerks off on that rock and away. This is Kim Haines. Rough sounds fun. I wouldn't be surprised. I've seen a lot of things online. Oh yeah. There's some, there's some great people and there's some crazy people. Oh this is mostly great people. Yeah, for sure. I find that my interactions online or almost mostly positive, the fuck. Like by far the problem is that's like having mostly non poisonous food. Yeah. Yeah. A little bit of poison enough. Oh, you'd have to do is go to this restaurant one out of 10 times they fucking poison. You'd never go back to that restaurant and yeah, I don't even think it's one out of 10 I think that the interactions that I have online that are negative, it's not even one out of 100 now. I don't think so. Those, for me, those are the ones that I am drawn to and I find myself, I see the negative, I go pass all these positive

Speaker 2:          00:08:56       and then I'll say something because I just, if I'm in a bad mood after a whole day of getting beat down by stupid comments and I'll have to do something and then I'll be like, why did I, so then I go back and like try to acknowledge some positive ones because I feel guilty. Well, I saw you post a picture of a bear that you shot the other day. It was a video of a berry shot. And I said, Ooh, I looked at those comments. I'm like, here we go. Which one was, it was a you, you, you shot a bear and you were opening its mouth. The children's teeth. Oh, ah, yeah, yeah, yeah, for sure. And I saw that video and I was like, Whoa, that's a landmine right there. I know bear, you know, bears crazy. It is. That is the, the one animal that I think people have the most distorted perceptions up cause it teddy bears.

Speaker 2:          00:09:43       Because Yogi and because I really want to take anybody who has these weird thoughts about bears, I just really want to bring them to John and John's place in Alberta. And I want to say, why don't you are going to come hang around and if we're lucky we're going to see a bear tear apart a baby bear. Because they do that every day. All the time. They get up out of their dens and they go looking for baby bears. Yeah. And then maybe if we're lucky, we'll see a bear get ahold of a fawn and it'll be crying and it'll eat, eat, eat, eat that thing alive. They'll have a different, they'll have a different take on it. They'll be like, kill that. Yeah. Or just people are nuts. They're trying to bring wolves into California or Colorado Rather. We're talking about bringing wolves into Colorado.

Speaker 2:          00:10:23       Like, okay, listen folks, you don't have to do that. You don't, you already have bears. You know, I saw this the other day. I think I've put up, I think it was what inspired me to put up there was a wolf video I posted. There's some great wildlife videos out there. Oh, it's crazy now. Right? Um, great. Not, not, they can be emotional. Like with that bear kill on the, the delcath was crying. That was really, I don't even like to see that. I mean I'm a hunter, but, uh, there's one or these wolves were chasing down this calwell elk. And you know, that's not a quick process. And I put that up because I had seen a couple of celebrities and I don't even know who the hell they are. Movie Stars I think or something. But they're saved the wolf fond or some wolf bullshit and they're like Halloween there to humans and they were howling like they were wolves. Woof. And it's like, I dunno, I mean wolves are great wills or I had wolves or one of my favorite animals, you know, called the Wild White Fang. Those books. I love those Jack London books when I was young. So wolves have always held a special place in my heart, but if they're straight killers. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:11:34       So I mean I'm not hating on him for doing that, but you just can't have wolves running around everywhere. We can't, you can understand right. In my neighborhood, yeah. I was uh, at home the other, I made a recording of this cause I was at home. My dogs are barking like crazy. It's like nine o'clock at night just wow. It's like what the fuck is going on? And I step outside and these coyotes are like a half a block away from my house. Just scream,

Speaker 6:          00:12:02       man.

Speaker 2:          00:12:04       Those are wolves. Those are little wools. Yeah. And they got ahold of something and then celebrating some dude sent me a video that's on his page of a, it's a compilation of all these videos from security cameras of coyotes killing cats and dogs. Yeah, yeah. Those are wolves. That's what they do. Those are the little bulbs. That's all they are. They can breed with wolves. I mean, they literally are wolves. It's a it, it's a fascinating thing that the disconnect that people have with predators, you know, and I look, if I was in Idaho or Montana and I saw wolves, I'd be pumped. I think. I would think it would be awesome. But he got to keep an eye on those things, folks. Yeah. You know, there's a reason why they killed him off 150 years ago and it wasn't because they're awesome. It's because they will kill people.

Speaker 2:          00:12:54       They will kill your kids. They will kill your dog. They will. They will. They, they. I've seen wolves in the wild. I saw a pack on Prince of Wales Island one time. They came down to the, to the water once. And I've seen him, I had a wolf tag actually when I was in British Columbia hunting buffalo and I thought it was going to get a, a shot at a wolf, um, up there. But I never have, but they give tags up there because they're trying to diminish the population. Yeah. I mean they have too many. It's 50 bucks. It's the same as in Alberta. I mean, you, you would get our bear tags to go when we go up there to John and gins and you know, $50 for a wolf tag also. So it's not like there's a low number of wolves, you know, but every time I've seen him, I have been in a certain amount of awe just because had been like this, this amazing animal for my entire life.

Speaker 2:          00:13:42       And I've just, it's hard not to look at a wolf and not think regal and wild and, and you know, there's that saying that, um, you know, you'll see bears and lions in the circus, but you'll never see a wolf. You know, they're just, and I did the commercial with the wolf to was amazing, but uh, well then under armor commercial you told him it was pretty crazy because they had this scene where the wolf snarls and they had a save that scene for the very end. Yeah. Because it was, they said it was supposed to be me against a wolf going after this hill. And then I ended up winning that little, the story as it was told and um, they needed to get to wolf snarling. And so they brought some meat out, gave it some meat, but they said, well, actually gave it then took it away. And obviously that's going to make any animal upset, especially a wolf. But they said, once we do that, we're done with the wolf because it's, it's not going to just snap out of it and it's just going to, that's going to be it's mindset for a while about it's not going to be happy. Yeah, there it is. Yeah. Go back to that. I think it shows that end. It should.

Speaker 4:          00:14:52       Yeah. Yeah. And that was actually, I mean people thought that that was edited and, and it wasn't, you know, right there with me knowledge right there with me. Um, you know, they did a great job of putting that commercial together. Uh, it wasn't necessarily snarling up me or growling at me, but it was there. It was, it was fun. That was a big was at wolf. I think it was about 130 pounds. I mean he's tall that, that's a big, that's what surprised me is how tall they are. Long legs. Right. Yeah. And I think, you know, we were talking about earlier, as far as endurance goes, wolves I believe are the number one animal out there as far as they can run miles and miles and miles and they're tall and they can just, you know, their gate is uh, you know, whatever it allows them to go for hours and miles.

Speaker 3:          00:15:40       Yeah. I was talking about running with my dog, you know, and he's only a year old and he's in such good shape now cause he runs with me all the time. Yeah. See if we run two miles, I run two miles, he runs seven or eight. Right. Cause he's running over and back and up and back and up and back and yeah, but it's amazing. Like what, how good a shape they're in right out of the box. Yeah. I mean, he's a fucking puppy and he just books it up that hill. Just, yeah. He turns around and looks at me like, come on bitch. I know. And he comes running back to me. Yeah. Animals,

Speaker 4:          00:16:12       you know, uh, animals pretty much have the advantage over us on everything other than, you know, the, I mean, they're stronger, stronger jaws. Uh, you know, the Ma, you're their muscles stronger for what they have. Um, we have an endurance as a advantage over most animals, like elk. But, uh, luckily we have, you know, we can use our minds.

Speaker 3:          00:16:35       Well, that is the reason why we're so weak. You know, it's so fascinating how things balance out. It's like the US using our mind, creating houses and cities and cars and just sitting in a chair all day. It makes you soft, but then you figured out how to make a gun. Yeah. And that balances everything out. Yeah. Unless the gun jams and then nature comes back into play. Yeah, yeah, yeah. All these people that are, you know, into the wolf, you know, save the wolf, the wolves. Okay. Like you guys go to Idaho, like people are freaking out up there like the wolves are okay. Oh, like they, they're, they're starting to, you know, you go to, um, Alaska. I was in a park city recently in Utah and uh, when I was there, they, uh, we went to a store that had a wolf rug and I was like, Jesus, I'm like yourself selling a wolf rug. And the guy explained to me, he said, well, these wolves are all shot by the government in Alaska because they're overpopulated. So they're in these areas where they're trying to protect the Moose population for these, uh, the indigenous people that are so subsistence hunters and live up there and they have like a certain quota. And he's like, so it's actually

Speaker 5:          00:17:50       like, it's a good thing to sell these rugs because they're going to shoot these wolves no matter what. They're trying to keep the populations in check. And I think that's, that's something that these people that have the pictures see that problem of like celebrities, missoula. They probably didn't think that shit through it all. They just think this is a cool thing to be a part. Of course everybody wants wolves to live. I'll just go and say we've got to support the wolf, we've got to save the wolf. And so it's like, it looks like a cool thing for you to be a part of. I think one of them was, would have been Lisa Bonet Aa isn't, she's like kind of a hippie. Right? She's a super hippie. Yeah. She's got a nose ring. Yeah. Everything. She's always, she's pretty, I remember that. But yeah, remember it's in a find that bill cosby was mad at her cause she was naked in a movie.

Speaker 5:          00:18:34       Remember she was naked and Angel Heart had mickey work and he was mad at that. Huh? Who's mad at that net? Funny. Yeah. Funny how things work out. It's ironical. Yeah. It is ironical. I mean, I look, I dunno, I think wolves are awesome. Don't get me wrong folks. Just, I just don't think, and this is, this was me too, before I started hunting for, I started taking regular trips into the woods. You know, you don't get it. You just don't get it. You got to go there. You do. If you don't go there, you don't get it. Yeah. You know, it's, uh, we try to tell the story, we're telling the story and it's getting through to some people. I mean, I can see it, I can see the, there's education there. I mean, and I'm sure you get messages every day from people who have never hunted, who are interested in it, who just want to know what the lifestyle is.

Speaker 5:          00:19:22       Because we, we've sort of romanticize the lifestyle and, and it's, and it's easy to do because it's the mountains and the mountains are, you know, you get that connection and you get that empowerment. Um, so I, I think we are kind of turning the tide a little bit. I got a message from a guy a while back maybe four or five months ago, who was a Vegan for a long time, started listening to the podcast at first, was upset about the talk about hunting, ran into some health issues. His doctor recommended. He started eating animal products again, started with eggs, worked his way back up to meet eight meet again. It was getting, you know, healthy grass fed, uh, you know, ethically sustained animals, ethically raised animals, decided to go hunting, became a hunter, shot his first deer, ate as far as deer and now he's going to be a hunter.

Speaker 5:          00:20:15       Yeah. I mean this guy went full circle, right. And part of the journey of him going for full circle was listening to people talk about it on the podcast and realizing this idea that he had in his head that these people that are out there hunting are all people that hate animals and they're cruel and they're just rednecks that are going out there drinking beer and shooting these animals and laughing and hooting and hollering about it. Yeah. You know, well there's a couple of points I want to make there. One of them is your podcast has been amazing for the education part. And I

Speaker 4:          00:20:48       mentioned this, uh, Adam and I did a podcast at the gritty bowman and, um, I said, you know, Joe's podcast, just because the, the type of person Joe is, is as far as being open minded, um, and giving everything a chance, not, not coming in with biases or the same type of listeners you have, you've kind of cultivated or, or you know, they, they like you because I don't know, they see themselves in you may be, but anyway, so those people have come in and listen to these podcasts like this without that bias. And when you listen to it and listened to us talk about it, it's not the Redneck, you know, laughing cause they're killing things person. They may have thought it's, you know, this whole thing, this whole thing we talk about. And so this podcast in particular is I think been a huge tool as far as promoting hunting and ethical hunting and um, just the empowerment of being a hunter. And so that, I don't know, just, just this venue. I Dunno. I Dunno if we could ever done that without, you know, the Joe Rogan podcast. It's been amazing. Um, I dunno, have you noticed that? I mean with, with other things besides hunting? Um,

Speaker 3:          00:21:58       I think floating, uh, that's a big thing. Yeah. Sensory deprivation tanks that that business was going under. There was virtually no tank centers in the world. There was a, like one of them in Burbank and I had heard one of them was in San Francisco. They're just, they were hard to find. There was none in New York. Like one guy had one in an apartment in New York that you could rent out. A guy had one like that in his house in Vegas that you could rent out. There was none. And now there's hundreds of data centers all over the world and we've been using the form. Dude, I got one in 2002. I bought a house, the house had a basement and I bought the house with the basement just being for two reasons. One. Um, because, uh, I wanted to put a tank in there and two, because the yard was big so I could have my dogs running around the yard.

Speaker 3:          00:22:48       Yeah. Just wanted to have a yard with the dogs, could run around. Those are my two requirements for house. Everything else was like, I really don't give a shit about it. And as long as there's the TV sits there and okay, here's where the bed goes. I'm a man, you know, I don't know. It's things that are living in deal sweat when it comes to houses. That dude's just don't sweat. But for me, a big one was, I tried to tank a couple of times at this place called soothing solutions in Burbank. I don't even know if it's around anymore, but um, and then, uh, I put a tank in my basement and then I started ranting and raving about it and doing these youtube videos about it. And then I got a new tank from the float lab, so I gave my old tank away online.

Speaker 3:          00:23:25       It had like a raffle, not raffle, but like a random draw. I said, just send me an email. I gave an email address out and I'll just pick a random person. So I literally just scroll through my email. I'm like bank right there and pick this guy out and set my tank to him and had it set up and sent the salt down to them, the little deal. And then, um, that alone, just having that contest and given away a tank. Yeah. And then putting together this video for the tank at red band put together this really cool video about it. So these tank centers, because we talking about it on the podcast, started opening up all over the world to the point where now when you sign up at a lot of tank centers, the first time you go there they say, how'd you hear about us? Whether it was through the Internet, through books or Joe Rogan, like I'm one of their, one of the, I'm one of the options on a lot of their questionnaires and that, that probably has had even more of an impact than, than hunting.

Speaker 4:          00:24:16       Well, it's, you know, it's amazing. I, I hear it all the time. Well people have told me, uh, you wouldn't be anything without Joe Rogan. That's, that's some comments that I've gotten.

Speaker 3:          00:24:28       Go again, you're concentrating on the negative ones. I know, but I wouldn't be bow on it if it wasn't for you. So there you go. Well I wouldn't be me if it wasn't for that. I wouldn't be the me that I am now. So there you go.

Speaker 4:          00:24:37       Okay. Well I put it cause I was like, God, I know. I don't know. I think we've talked about it before, but this podcast gets to more, more people than CNN. Is that right? Oh yeah, yeah, for sure. So it's, and I heard a Jordan Peterson talking about we don lemon. That's good. That's good. Cause I, I I trust this more than CNN. CNN, Oh, you're a redneck. You're on that Fox news tip. Oh, Fox News. Now that's where you get your news solid reporting. That is legit. That's Sean Hannity, that guy. I trust him with everything. Yep, I hear Ya. But, uh, so, and I heard Jordan, you were talking about his recent trajectory. I mean, he's been, I, I'm assuming you've been brilliant in his whole life. Well, in the last 18 months or two years or whatever. And I think a lot of that is because of here. So I put in my phone, I was like, I'm going to do some research on Joe Rogan before this. I'm going to turn the tables on him, I'm going to podcast him. So I was like putting it in there, Joe Rogan influence or Joe Rogan, uh, um, a fact or whatever. And uh, I couldn't find anything. So I think, I think, I think I need to write something to quantify that, but, but yeah, this gets to so many,

Speaker 3:          00:25:59       it gets so a lot of people, but in all honesty, like just being, not, not even just trying to be humble, but all I'm doing is talking about shit that's out there. It's real simple. It's like I'm not really doing anything unusual other than that, just being open minded, which I try very hard to do. I have, when you say you just do this and just do that, nobody else does that. They come in with these biases. You know, so you say that's a problem. Yeah. You say you just do that. That's a big thing. I think people need to stop doing that. I think that's a big part of the problem we have in this world. And I was talking with, uh, uh, Dan Harris from good morning America. That's what he's on, right? Yeah. Um, and he was, he used a word that, I love a term that I love.

Speaker 3:          00:26:46       Toxic tribalism. Yeah. You know, so I mean, you see that with CNN versus Fox News. It's like neither one of them want to look at things subjectively. Fox News has a very clear right wing bias. CNN has a very clear left wing bias and they just go to war with each other. Right. And then the president's call and everybody fake news and you know, it's, it's hard to, to see what's really going on. People want to look at their side, they want to defend their side and they never want to say, okay, I see this guy's point. Yeah. But you gotta be able to see people's points. I mean, that's one thing that I always say about vegans after I make fun of them. I say I s I understand why you would want to do that and I think it's a compassionate choice. I get it.

Speaker 3:          00:27:28       I totally understand. But I do and I, I support their decision. I don't think there's anything wrong with it. I think you should be real careful with your health if you're doing that though. And I'm not bullshitting. This is not me being facetious or yeah, I'm not being a meathead. You should be careful with your health. There's a lot of things that you should probably check. B 12 is a big one. That's a huge issue with vegans is a, b, 12 deficiencies. And I think if you, if you are a Vegan, you should consider supplementing with things that you don't have a problem with eating. Like maybe even some cricket protein or mollusks like cell shelf. If people should look into shellfish, shellfish. Not only is it are they sustainable, but they're so primitive. They don't even have like a, a neurological system. Like they don't feel any fucking pain.

Speaker 3:          00:28:12       Like, you could eat clams all day long. They don't know what the fuck is going on. This is, we have this idea about clams because they do that cause they close that somehow now. Oh, the poor little thing is just trying to hide like that, that in there, the oysters. Oh, okay. I didn't know anything about it either. I know about bow hunting. Yes you do. Yes you do. But to me, um, meat tastes better. Yeah. You feel better to know. But as you were saying, yeah, I don't have a problem with vegans or their diet or, and I understand, I mean, you know, if you think about, um, killing an animal, nobody wants to kill animals. Right? I mean, that's not, I dunno, that's never, he didn't want to kill an animal for no reason. No. You want the meat of the animal and killing it and just not enjoyable.

Speaker 3:          00:29:03       You know, it's, it's part of the process. Weird sense of loss, right? Yeah. Yeah. So I get that. They're like, well, I don't want to, I don't want to kill any animals. I get it. That's fine. Yeah. But yeah, just having that, you know, the biases that come with it or is what causes problems? Well, there they're doing what they think is good to shame. People who eat meat or attack people who eat meat and especially attack people actively go out and kill the animals themselves because they think that somehow or another it will lessen the amount of animals that are killed. I think the opposite happens. I think it shores up people's aggression towards vegans get it. They, they firmly plant their heels on the other side of the line and they're like, fuck you, hippie [inaudible] asshole tree hug and pitches. Go eat your sprouts.

Speaker 3:          00:29:52       I'm going to go over here and eat burger. I mean, there's a lot of people that go out and eat burgers because of that. Yeah. I probably, yeah. No. My friend Mike Hockridge from BC met him. Yeah. Mike. Mike was dealing with people from Vancouver that were sending him hate mail because of wolves now where he lives. He lives in the real British Columbia where there's fucking while olds and grizzly bears everywhere. Yeah. We found a a wolf kill while we were up there. It was pretty wild. Wolf had got ahold of a moose calf. It just tore it apart. The pack of wolves, they're all over the place and it, it's pretty fresh too, but he's shot a bunch of them and somehow or another, some group of people found out that he shot wolves and where he lives, you get an unlimited amount of wolf tags, right?

Speaker 3:          00:30:39       They're trying to kill wolves as much as possible that you can kill a hundred words a day if you can. Then that's totally legal because they have ranchers up there and like one of, I think one of his neighbors, they wolf, it was a in the middle of the winter, wolf got ahold of one of the cows and I got a bunch of wolves, a pack. So these people are in their house. They listened to a pack of wolves, terror plot and cow that's like, you know, a hundred yards from their fucking bed. Scary freaky shit. Right? They live in the real while. So these people were sending him all these death threats and so he said, look, every time you guys send me one of these, I'm going to shoot a wolf in the guts. Yeah. Radio silence. They stopped. Yeah. He said to this lady, he said, every time you send me an email, I'm going to shoot a wolf in the guts.

Speaker 3:          00:31:19       Yeah. Well, I dunno. I was probably in front of a keyboard going. Yeah, it's a tough one though. That was a tough one. Yeah. Yeah. You know the BC was, they just outlawed grizzly hunting up there because of that. They did a poll in, I think Vancouver, and I'm not only that, they did a very limited email poll with about 3000 participants. Right. And 76% of 3000 people said that they didn't, they were opposed to grizzly bear hunting. But I think if you're going to have any kind of a poll like that, you should have to have these people educated first as to what their voting about. Do you really understand what it's like up there? I know. Cause if you talk to Mike, Mike shot a grizzly bear in the head from like 20 feet away as it was trying to get into his cabin. Like they are fucking ferocious and they're huge and there's a lot of them. There's no shortage of grizzly bears in British Columbia now, but it's that whole education piece. But that's, I mean, you could take that to even voting in our elections. Sure. I mean we need to educate people. People need to be educated on the topics, not just hunting but everything. But they can vote. Their vote still counts. Let's say you can't tell people they can't vote because that's fucked up. You can't, well, you have to

Speaker 5:          00:32:40       have a certain amount of education or you can't vote. But what they need to do is trust the people who do now. Yeah. You know, like up there, the biologist who are actually have boots on the ground or but, and there are no, the what grizzly are doing and how many there are. Let's go ahead and trust those people. You know, hard to see. When you're in Vancouver though. The problem is you're in Vancouver, you're eating at a nice Sushi restaurant and hanging out with friends. You know, he'd go into the movies. Everything's beautiful. Vancouver, so nice. So that you look at the mountains to whistler off in the distance. Oh, that's so pretty. Yeah. I don't want to kill a bear. Don't kill the best and now, but if you just go on a six hour car ride, just go. Just keep going north.

Speaker 5:          00:33:21       Keep going north and I you car and I want you to go for a two mile hike into the woods. Just go for a two mile hike. And I want you to sit there for a day. Just sit there for a day. You're going to see some shit. Right? And you will realize you will, oh, this is a different world. This world is, this is a wild world. Like these things out here. They don't give a shit if people are real or not. They are. They're doing what they've always done. The bear running around looking for shit to eat, the animals running around looking to get the fuck away from things that are trying to eat them. And this is how they've always existed. Yeah, yeah, I know. And it's, you know those bare and it's just like the, the wolves killing the cow. You said 20 feet from the, wherever they lived.

Speaker 5:          00:34:00       I mean, that's just what they do. But, and that's what grizzlies do. Grizzlies are going to kill. They're can, you know, if they can kill a moose calf or an elk cath or a deer fon, they're not wasting a bunch of energy chasing a full grown animal around. So they're using less energy, burning less calories. They get an easy kill. They get high protein. That's just what they do. But the reason why we need to kill them is we're not, they're never going to stop doing what they do. We just need to control the numbers. So how often that's happening. If that's happening too often, because there's too many of them will then the Moose and elk numbers go down, you know, and it's this balancing act and people will say, well, I'm just let animals take care of themselves. They always have been and it's like, no, we've, oh, we've always hunted.

Speaker 5:          00:34:42       It's just now that people are saying, well we shouldn't hunt. You know, so they're trying to take man out of the equation. Now. Man's always been in the equation as far as hunting. Yeah. I think people have an idea about it based on the excess that people have committed. I mean, people have committed some atrocities when it comes to animals in this country alone. Everyone's seen those stacks of buffalo heads. And when they were doing market hunting in particular in the 18 hundreds and ma, many people attribute that to hunters, um, erroneous Lee. That's not really what it was. What killed off all those animals was a thing called market hunting. And this is back. People have to realize there's no refrigerators back then. And so, you know, you weren't like getting steaks and freezing them. And there was not a lot of like large scale agriculture back then either. There's, there was a few ranchers and farmers, but when people had all these animals that were out in the wild and they could hire these people that were in the military, they had just gotten done

Speaker 3:          00:35:38       with the war and they were good shots. They would, this would be a good way to make a living and go out there and shoot some buffalo, bring back the tongues buffalo and tongue was like, they would shoot a giant buffalo and just take the tongue. They'd take the hides and you know, sometimes they would take the meat and some and then they, they wiped out almost everything. They wiped out most of the deere, most of the elk, most of the antelope until guys like Teddy Roosevelt came along well, Whoa, Whoa, whoa, whoa, hit the fucking brakes. Like we've got to protect these animals. We've got to protect this land. We've got to protect these animals. We got to set up private or public land rather were will, you can't do anything to it where people could just roam and hike and camp. And fish and hunt and do whatever you want, and we got to make sure we protect these animal populations because they got down to some incredibly low number of elk at the turn of the century. Right?

Speaker 2:          00:36:28       Yeah. Well, I mean they almost wiped out buffalo completely. I don't know what the hell got to, but I know, you know, is as you know, as conservationists, we like to say that hunters are conservationists now, but so one of the figures that we share is that there's more animals now than there was a hundred years ago, so I dunno know what they were a hundred years ago, what the numbers were. But yeah, very low. Not only that, there's more whitetail deer today than when Columbus landed, although Columbus road didn't really get here when Columbus landed in The Bahamas is more white tail deer here than now. And part of that is because of farming, which is real weird. Like, like a white tail deer is a weird animal. Yeah. They're kind of a farm animal a lot of a way. Yeah, it, and it's almost like, you know, if you're doing it right as far as killing the older bucks, you're almost farming.

Speaker 2:          00:37:21       You know, you're not harvesting when they're young. You're waiting till they're mature. And so it's, it's almost like, you know, you're letting that crop, uh, age essentially. What does this Jamie, in 1910, the u s forest service estimated there were only between 501,000 elk in Colorado. Yeah. Holy Shit. And now there's a hundred and what? 25,000. Oh, 150,000. I don't know. There was a fuck a lot more than that. The numbers of fuckload. There's 10 million. Okay. It says, uh, the elk population North America stood at about 10 million animals before European settlers came and systematic wholesale hunting began. Wow. That's amazing. [inaudible] Colorado became famous for his trophy hunting and European gentleman traveled here to try their luck, Sir George Gore. I heard that guy was a con. I'm just making that up. He's a trophy hunter. He's a trophy hunter for whom Gore pass near. Kremmling is named, came from Ireland to hunt in western Colorado. He shot elk and deer from the bed of a wagon. What a Dick. That's real honey. He only took prime hides and large antlers and left amit to rot a boy. What a bad person. That's that sentence right there. And that's when people think happens

Speaker 5:          00:38:36       that I don't know anybody who ever does. That's illegal. First of all, coaching. Yeah, that's a good thing. The good thing to point out is illegal to not take the meat rallies illegal. To not take the mean, you have to take the neck meet in Colorado, you have to cut out the neck, all edible. And you got all the edible meat. And um, and even between the ribs, I mean there's a little, I dunno about if that's a law in Colorado. I know in Alaska. Yeah, you killed a moose. You, you're even taking that meat in between the ribs. I mean, you're taking all edible meat there. And so people say, well, are you one of those trophy hunters? Or you know, you just don't take the head and leave it to rot. It's like, you can't do that. Why would you do that anyway?

Speaker 5:          00:39:15       It's so stupid, but it's illegal anyway. If you walked down the street, if you, if you eat steak and you walked down the street and you saw like for some reason someone had put coolers of prime rib eyes, it just sitting there, you'd be like, what the fuck is this here for? Once we'd look around, is there anybody here? I've got to take this. Yeah. This can just leave this here. Right, so I have to do to rot, so let's just do that. When you're hunting, that's just you finding it, right? Probably you would not eat it. Now that I think about it, you'd be like, Whoa, what is this a trap I get the point you were making that when I was making is if you go through all the effort to go hunt and you do eat meat, of course you're going to eat the meat.

Speaker 5:          00:39:56       Not only that, the meat you're eating is incredibly precious. Yeah, like elk meat is incredibly proud. It's so delicious. Oh, here's, here's what I know, so when we go hunting, and I can speak for myself, I'm sure I can speak for you too. For when you go hunting, you bring back all the Mutu can you eat all the Mutu Canada, that animal you like sharing it that typical, I'll just say American, but waste 40% of their food, not, I'm going to stop this. What they buy. You know how what I'm done now in the garbage type thing, so hunters, I know I don't do that. If I kill a bowl and I bring all that meat home, 40% of that is not going in the garbage. No. You know what I mean? So it's because we, we are, we have that connection with the animal.

Speaker 5:          00:40:42       To me it'd be, I don't know if I'm thinking about it, it'd be disrespectful, but I just, it's so it's worth, those are so much value in it. I would never throw it in the garbage, you know what I mean? But when you buy it at a store, whatever, you know, I'm not saying people are putting, you know, 40% of prime rib and the garbage, but just as a rule, we waste a lot of food. I think it would be a good thing for every single human being to grow some vegetables. And if you eat meat too, once in your life, kill an animal. I think everyone should do it. I really do. There was an article that I tweeted today about, um, that, I forget the subject, that title of it rather, but it was something along the lines of it's not, it's not healthy to hide from the fact that there's, there's death involved in eating meat. Right. I did a terrible job of paraphrasing that. Fun. What that title is. So article. Okay. We shouldn't hide the gory details of how meet reaches our plate. Right. What are the chickens? Yeah. And I think that's very, very important. And I think that like what I'm looking at right there, life is fucking gross.

Speaker 4:          00:41:56       That's her life. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          00:41:59       It's fucked up. Cause I eat chickens but I don't eat my chickens. Like someone said, do you eat those chickens Mike? Now there's like my pets. It's weird. Right. But I'll, I'll eat the shit out of some chicken.

Speaker 4:          00:42:10       Yeah. But when you, but when you think of it like that, I mean, so when we're, we're looking at this picture, I know people looking at or listening to the podcast can't see the picture, but I mean

Speaker 5:          00:42:19       we're looking at an enormous warehouse. I mean enormous. It looks like several football fields long and it's filled with chickens that are just stuffed on top of each other, right? Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:42:29       And that's their life until they get killed. And when you think of that, okay, would I rather do that or would I rather procure my own meat hunting? You know, everybody would say that's not right. And I believe hunting is a noble way of procuring me. And um, I think when you look at that, but people don't see that. They don't think about that when they order their, you know, chick chicken nuggets. They're not thinking about that. No,

Speaker 5:          00:42:58       just hungry, just hungry. It's just too easy to get food mean. I don't think it's too easy to get food. That's why we're such fat toes. That's a big problem. But it's also just, it's also too easy psychologically because we just don't have any, any connect. I think you should have a connection if you're eating a living thing just seems, it just seems like you should understand what it is. Just for your own mind, for you, for your own, for just a, for a sense of balance. And 97% of Americans eat meat, meat and something like 65% of vegans when they get drunk eat meat. It really has some crazy number. Some crate, it might, it might be higher than that. I think I read it was like 84% of vegans. See, I'm just making up numbers at this point. It's fine. It doesn't mean it might've been a tweet I read.

Speaker 5:          00:43:41       Somebody might have just made that up. Just going to audit us. So, but so a Vegan drunk meets like an ex girlfriend. Yeah. Right. It's like an ex girlfriend. Yeah. Yeah. So you get drunk if you're lonely, you're taking risk and you're eating a hot dog. Is that right? Yeah. Same thing. Yeah, exactly. Saying I got it. Yeah. It's a little over a third that confessed to a eating meat when they're drunk. Oh, well then it's 100% because three quarters or more liars. Yeah. Surprising number of drug vegetarian secretly meet. That is an awesome picture right there. The problem with this, this thing is, this is a third of people that they asked British fit vegetarians. Oh, British people, it's totally different animal. They fucking hate hunters. They love saying cunt. Oh, did I see, did I say, listen, I think contin there. I say that really? I thought I'd do. I've been looking phono flushing

Speaker 3:          00:44:31       out. You said effing con we didn't say fucking gun. No, that's the customer. Yeah, they do. They do live to say con, but they're, they're the most delusional of there's like South Americans. There's no hunting. Exactly. No hunting. Brazil for some strange reason. I get a lot of hate from Brazil. They love me. You go to Brazil, they invented that. You husker IA. Chu Has Korea's or this shit, man. Yeah. Did we go to one or went Brazil? Is that where they threw the plates in the halls, right. Oh, that's right. Yeah, they threw the plate. Yeah. They fucking chuck fruit plates like Frisbees and shatter them. Yeah. They know how to party in prison. They do and it's just me on me. On me. You get a beautiful card. It's got green on one side and red on the other. A lot of people have been to these like a folder to chow is a great one that's here in la and all over the country, but that's what they ate.

Speaker 3:          00:45:26       They're famous for me. When you're done with the meat, you give him the red card. Yeah. Right? Yeah. It's green on one side and down the other. Yeah. You tap out. Yeah, we go to town. Nobody can fuck with Ari Shaffir. When it comes to that place, nobody really know. I've never seen a look. When me and Ari go to eat, generally speaking, I'm more of a glutton and him, I'll eat more than him, but not at that place really. There's something about like all you can eat. I think maybe it's some like cause his dad was in the Holocaust or something like that. Or He's just like, because it's free because it's like you could eat, she just won't stop. I've never seen anything like it. I go like, where are you putting all this fucking food? Everyone's done. Joey Diaz has done. I'm done. Eddie Bravo is done.

Speaker 3:          00:46:12       We're done. We're just sitting there like this. Ah, are you still John Green who's still in green? He's like, I'm still on green. Guy will come over and got lamb chops, lamb chops. She has to bring the lamb chops. God, I can't, I've never seen, especially in Brazil, they're all, they know how to do it and they have grass fed meat over there too. They're not fucking around with the corn fed and all that. They don't have the sick fat cows that we have over here. But it is weird how you get a lot of hate from people over there, but it's because of the propaganda and the, the negative aspects of trophy hunting. Like when you see a guy standing there with a dead elephant or some shit like that, like, wow, fuck, would you kill an elephant? Like that kind of stuff in people's mind like, or a giraffe.

Speaker 3:          00:46:55       Why the fuck would you kill a giraffe? Like people have this idea that these people just go over there to kill things. And so this is what trophy hunting is. So they see you with an elk, like, oh, you piece of shit. Why are you just go over there and shoot that thing? Like, yeah, no, this is my food for a year. Like you're, you're going to that Goddamn steakhouse and you keep that thing on green. What do you think you're doing? You're killing, killing with your credit card. And now it's a, well, all we can do is try to educate and share the sh, share the lifestyle. It's like, I think it's important, um, to be leaders and, and how we share that,

Speaker 2:          00:47:30       you know, cause I see things that I wish weren't shared sometimes. I mean, I've, I've even made mistakes. I'm not trying to say that I got, I'm dialed in and I never make them a shit mistake on what I post or whatever. But, um, I just think we need to be stewards of hunting and, and if we do it right, we're not going to get everybody and we're not going to educate everybody because there's some that just won't listen. Um, but we can make some inroads. I think we have, and I think, um, I think it's important to relay experience.

Speaker 3:          00:47:59       It says, because I think there's, there's, there's things to be learned from a lot of experiences, you know, like talking to you and talking to Courtney Galt, doe Walter about just ultra marathons and endurance running. There's something to be learned from that about the kind of mindset that it takes to do that. I think having these conversations with you guys has changed the way I look at those things. Like, fuck man, for, I'd met you. I never ran. I'm running all the time now. I run all the time. You look slow. I've been have you, how much you weigh? One 96. [inaudible] 95 the same. No, I'm a little lighter or it was up to like two oh four when I was a fat so. Oh okay. That was the fastest I've ever been thought you look slimmer. I'm a little maybe a little slimmer maybe I'm like one 95 or one 91 94 is when I'm pretty lean.

Speaker 3:          00:48:46       We've got a full six pack. Look at one 94 when I hit about two, when I get to 200 that's when I start. I go, okay, we better start doing the fasting again. Yeah. When I really get into my intermittent fasting, I'll spend either 14 or 16 hours without eating in a day. I want to eat for like 10 hours in a day. Yeah. I eat about every 30 minutes. I'm actually starving. How you starting right now? Now you're in a different thing though. Cause I'm, I'm eating mostly fat and you know a lot of guys are on that carnivore diet. Now when we had that Sean Baker in here, that doctor, the, the bells, Chris Bell and Mark Bell and those guys are both on the carnivore diet. Now they don't need anything but meat all day. Wow. Yeah. Mark said he's never felt better. So just to thin it looks ripped. If you look at his instagram page, he's fucking jacked. Shredded. It's also on steroids that they're probably helps but, but he looks good. Yeah. Well it's uh, I dunno. I, one of my favorites, she picks up because Jesus Christ. Yeah. Look at him. Look at that picture. Oh my is meat while he's eating his meat jacked. Yeah. Jack,

Speaker 2:          00:49:54       Stan plus steroids. A little bit starts. Right. But whatever he's at Mark Bell. Yeah. Yeah. He's a fucking animal. Then I watched the bigger, stronger, faster. Is that what it was? Yeah. Yeah, it was his, his brother was on there. Right. Three brothers and one of them died of them. Died. They hit a drug problem. He was a pro wrestler. Yeah, that's the one I watched as it. Yeah. It was a powerful document was, and it was, it was pretty sad. I mean, he wanted, you know, his brother wanted to make it be something. It's just like a lot us, you know,

Speaker 4:          00:50:28       and you know, it's hard to say.

Speaker 3:          00:50:30       Well, he ran into the problem that I've seen many people run into those goddamn prescription pills. They're so scary. They are. They're one of the scariest things that are in modern society. And it's something that's not talked about enough. You only hear it talked about from family members of people that have lost. People are close friends and people that have lost people. But it's a, it's a giant problem in this country. We're losing thousands of people every day too.

Speaker 4:          00:50:55       Pain pills. Yeah. Well I, you know, I put something up not long ago about suicide and it was amazing how many people sent me messages. I mean, how many people are affected or just are dealing with negative thoughts of their own and then a little mini battles and it's just like that one post. I don't know. I think people just need to know that there's people out there that care, you know? But I don't know how with, when they get into that cycle of pills, I don't really know. I'm not a doctor. I don't know how that works. I don't know what they're dealing with. I just know that, you know, social media can be used. It can be irritating sometimes, but man, it can be good, especially for people like that. She's able to reach out and maybe, you know, get some support or encouragement or something, you know? And it's

Speaker 3:          00:51:47       well for someone that they admire, like you, that's gigantic, you know, if they can, they can read something like that. Sometimes that's all people need. Just a little wind in their sail. Just a little something.

Speaker 4:          00:51:57       So something I'm gonna say I dorm thing, I'll, I say, you know, it was, it was in the news. There's a quarterback up at Washington state that killed himself. You know, he's going to be the starting quarterback on the football team, 21 years old. And he shot himself a few weeks ago. And I didn't want, I didn't want to say that well, because I don't want to say that. Well, it's because it's an athlete. That's why anybody cares, you know? But it's anybody, it's any person who's 21 years old. I'm thinking what a tragedy that is. But it just, that was in the new, so it happened. And so that's why I put it up and for no, or I can't do anything. It's not like I'm, I don't, I'm, I just want people to be aware and just to have that number to call. And the case, there was a 21 year old feeling that exact same way and there's this seemingly some kid who had everything. I mean the co a college quarterback and it's just like, it just breaks my heart to think that they would get to, that he would get to that point where, you know, killing himself was the answer. And it's just harder for younger people because they don't have, I have a

Speaker 3:          00:52:59       lot of life experiences and they don't know that like a guy like you or I who's lived a long time and I've seen a lot of shit that you've gone through your ups and downs and when you hit it down you go, well this sucks, but I know it's going to get better. Yeah, just got to figure out why it sucks. Address why it sucks. Uh, apologize if you need to correct whatever the issue is that's making you feel like shit. Pull yourself out of it, do a bunch of positive things. Next thing you know you're going to be okay again. Yeah, and sometimes when you're 21 years old, you do, you think the world's over. You know? I mean, I remember when my girlfriend dumped me when I was 18 I was so fucking bummed out. I couldn't imagine. I couldn't imagine living without her.

Speaker 3:          00:53:41       I was like, I can't believe that this is over. I can't put you so devastated cause you're fucking Europe baby. 18 year old baby. You don't know Jack Shit. But when you get older and you've had more life experiences and more things, you get more perspective and you kind of understand like what this feeling is bad feeling and you just know, well, hey, I just gotta get the fuck out of the house. I've got to go hang out with my friends, got to go do a bunch of positive things. Go hit the gym, take a yoga class, do something fun, and then everything's going to be okay. You realize, hey, you know, life's not perfect. There's no such thing as a perfect life. It doesn't exist. You're going to have ups, you're going to have downs. But when you're 21 years old, it's very difficult to see that. And also who knows what else was going on in his life, whether it was pills or whether it's a head trauma. And a lot of football players wind up killing themselves. It's not a coincidence. It's directly related to head drama.

Speaker 4:          00:54:34       Yeah, I'm not, I'm not sure. I don't want to speculate. I don't eat that. It's just, uh, I just, you know, I just, it's horrible. I get a lot of, I just, when you said, well you go hang out with your friends, it sometimes, cause I've been in certain groups where even my friends aren't positive, you know what I mean? So you're like, that even makes it worse. They can. So I mean, that's where I see the positives of social media and I wish I could respond to everybody who sends me a message and just say, Hey, you know, and it's, it's Cliche, keep hammering or whatever. But I know, I know I get inspiration from people online and if, um, I get a shout out, it feels good. It doesn't mean anything. Where's your t shirt? It doesn't mean, I don't know if it means it doesn't mean anything but eat some.

Speaker 4:          00:55:19       But it does to me, you know? And so I just know what it's like to be in a small town and to not, I'm not saying I didn't have any positive friends or whatever, but I would know what it feel like to not have anybody to really lean on, you know? Yeah. And so I tried to think about maybe people like I was and a man. I just think we can, I dunno together Shit we can, we can do a lot of positive things. I just, it just, like I said, it breaks my heart to think of people. Um, living negative. Yeah. Each day.

Speaker 3:          00:55:50       I agree with you. And I think that's one of the things that social media can do that's positive and also podcasts can do that's positive is it exposes you. Like there's people that are listening to this conversation right now that they're taking comfort from it. Like they might be either stuck in a shitty job or they might be alone and they're here with us. They're here hanging out and they realize those people like us out there. This is friendly, positive people out there. Even if you're alone, at least you're not around negative twats, right? You know, there's a lot of negative people around and it's unfortunate that they're negative. I wish you could fix them all, but sometimes life gives you these lessons in the form of disastrous lives that you witness and you see these disasters lives and you just go, oh my God, I gotta get the fuck away from this crazy ass hole and live my life in a more positive, productive way because I see what can happen if you blame the world for all your problems and you, all you do is hate and you hate on people that are successful and you hate on people that are whatever wealthy, good looking, whatever the fic pick, pick the thing.

Speaker 3:          00:56:56       Girls that are thin, whatever the thing is that you hate on, there's so many people out there that waste all of their energy doing that. And if you're around them, you can't fix them. It's so hard to fix people. But what you can do is see what they're doing that's so negative and just completely degrade the quality of their life and just don't do that. Recognize, recognize that this is not the way to live. And then go listen to a podcast with some positive people and say, look at this guy. This guy's out there eating healthy, doing good things. He lost 15 pounds. She went running and just decided to start doing marathons and he did this and this guy's building a fucking house. Like you can. You can find a lot of positive examples of people online today.

Speaker 4:          00:57:41       That's, that's one of the reasons why I'm so drawn to ultra running. I mean, because whether you like running or not, the people that do that are some great positive people. I mean, they're savages. Oh. But they're also, you get so use of winning those many battles in the long run. And you, I mean, you have to and you get strength from each other. So at the finish line or during the race is you can get a bond. Um, there's a saying, you know, he sheds his blood with me, will be my brother. And it's like, it's not, that's probably derive from war and, and I get that. And it's not like a war or anything like that, but it's going through a mini battle. And when you do that with somebody and you share that experience, you get that connection. And it's like, it's why even though I don't know courtney that well, um, I know what she does and I really look up to her ability to just be a beast and that whole environment, the ultra running environment and community is a, is empowering for me for sure. And, and that's, that's why I love even just being around people like that, it just makes you better. Well, they're, they're exceptional. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:58:54       Those are exceptional people there. They have an exceptional mind to be able to endure something like a 238 mile race through the Moab desert. You've got to be something special. Yeah. There's, there's a little thing in the back of has, has want to just sit down,

Speaker 4:          00:59:08       lunches, quit. I says, enough's enough. We're already ran five miles. Where do you want it? This is enough, man. You ran a marathon. I isn't enough. You had two marathons. So you sit the fuck down. We just sit the fuck down and take a nap. But you have to be able to shut off and most people

Speaker 2:          00:59:22       can't shut that off. Can't, you know, it's, it's tough. It's, it's amazing. I mean, um, my brother was with me on that last one and uh, and it's, and it's weird to share, uh, an experience like that with somebody because you can be similar, but in the course of something at three days like that, you're in low points at different times, you know what I mean? And so it's really hard. It's really hard to win each of those battles because at one time when you might, I dunno, it's just, it seems like that'd be easier. But I think in, in some respects it is, but it's, man, it does, it's tough. It was tough all the way around. So when you're going through a three day, 238 mile run does it, it, it gets bad at certain times where you just feel like shit and then if you keep going it gets better and then it gets bad again.

Speaker 2:          01:00:21       Yeah. And then it gets better. Oh yeah. You're up and down, up and down the whole time. And, but you know that if you keep going, even when you feel like dog shit, you'll eventually break through and start feeling okay again. I don't know. There's no guarantee. There's no guarantee. No, there's no you hope. Have you ever gone through a whole long race and felt like dog shit the entire time? Yeah. Which one of those? Uh, well like the 24 hour run, you know, cause that's usually like my first tough one of the years in June. So I haven't really prepared for it. And now, cause I'm always after spring bear and uh, I haven't been training because I've been up in bear camp and doing whatever. So that's always one where I know I'm just pretty much going to be miserable the whole time.

Speaker 2:          01:01:06       There's going to be no light at the end of the tunnel, other than one of the 24 hours is up. So that one, I know I'm just going to have to grind it out. But, and that's, that's where I'm like [inaudible] it's a, this is one day out of my life, just do it. I'm just going to be miserable. Um, you know, on, on Moab, that one started off and I felt terrible right out of the, I mean I felt, I was like, we were God don't want to think like 19 or maybe 15 miles in something like that. An aid station. I'm going, this is not good cause teen miles in. It's crazy as you were running a marathon a day. Yeah. Yeah. So why was 15 miles so bad? Um, I dunno. There's sometimes when you, do you ever go on a run and your legs just feel heavy and he just don't feel good?

Speaker 2:          01:01:55       Yeah. So that's what that, I just, I was like, I wanted to be fresh and I want it to feel light on my feet and I want to get out there. And I was like, it's not a good sign when I didn't, because, you know, we just essentially started the race and it was hot and I had run out of water already one time. And, um, my legs felt heavy. And so it was a, it wasn't looking good. And then courtney was way out ahead and you know, they're saying I, you know, with, I didn't really know who she was at that time. So we were, me and my brother Taylor, we were thinking we'll 70 in the 70s would win the race. So I thought, well, I want to go out and, and aim for finishing in the 70s. And when you say seventies, what do you mean, 70 hours?

Speaker 2:          01:02:45       Yeah. So I figured, because what usually one big foot was high sixties in big foot's two oh five two oh five. And so this is, you know, close to 35 miles further. So we just figured, well, probably seventies is going to get it done. And so she went out and she had, there's an under a couple of other guys with, or I think, and they went out pretty hard. And, uh, you know, there's updates and where they were. And I didn't know, I didn't know at that time she was the American record holder for the hundred 20 or the 24 hour run. She'd run 160 miles I think in 24 hours this Christ. And so I was like, oh well they just went too fast. You know, cause I had done that before and like a big foot the year before and I thought, well they'll come back, you know, so meaning it'll balance out.

Speaker 2:          01:03:36       We'd catch up or they come back. And uh, I think the guys with her ended up dropping off a little bit and then she never came back. She just, well one of them dropped out, totally tried to keep up with her and he couldn't. Then he wound up dropping out. Totally. She's a monster and she's eating Nachos and candy. That was crazy. Drinking beer. Well, all these people are on like all these diets watching their macro nutrients and, no, but I didn't want to say that is cause that, cause I listened to you talk to her about that and excuse me, I've seen a lot of comments about that. But what you got to keep in mind is the, her training. So you can't say, well I run 15 miles a week and I'm going to eat Nachos and beer. Right. So she's running 120 miles a week.

Speaker 2:          01:04:19       Probably you can eat pretty much whatever you want. So I get that. But it's also like I was asking her about like the nutritional content of our food. You really monitoring how much protein you get versus Fido nutrients and minerals. No, no. She's gotten it out. She probably just needs calories, you know, she just, it doesn't matter. It didn't matter what, how she gets them just needs calories to sustain herself. Just think for just a, the cells of your body, you would need more nutrients. I mean who knows? She's obviously a fucking savage. Yeah. But who knows if she really monitored her diet and ate super healthy, she might be better maybe, which is just terrifying maybe. Yeah, she's, she's amazing. She's so normal to me. Hang out with her. Like when she did the podcast, she's just fun and laugh and look, you would never imagine that Jesus like elite ultra marathon runner, I would think you'd have to be like super stoic and intense and just, and when you see her she's wearing like, it looks like basketball shorts.

Speaker 2:          01:05:21       Yeah. Like, yeah, exactly. Shorts. It's not like, you know, you see some of these track athletes and they got the tight little shorts on and the, and the singlet and they're like, you know, she does like it with a kind of a baggy shirt and baggy shorts and then just crushing people. Crazy. Yeah. She's, but I love that though. I love outliers. A lot of people that come along with don't make any sense. I'm like, what the fuck? Like did she so much better than everybody else? She won that 238 mile race by 22 miles, something like that. Yeah, 22 miles ahead of the second place winner. And the guy who got second is this done fucking animal has done as an animal. She was 22 miles ahead of him. Now imagine get whupped not just whooped, but what 22 miles ahead by someone was eating Nachos and drink beer and eat candy.

Speaker 2:          01:06:17       I love that. I love someone that doesn't make any sense, who is just so much better. It's just like, wow, we got to fucking throw the, throw a monkey wrench into this whole idea. The only thing I got on anybody is can they pack out an elk there? You got to, you got to sit on them. You know, if that was the race, you'd fuck them all up. But what I like about her also is I flew home the other day, I can't remember where it was from, but I flew over like there's some in the cascades of Oregon, there's a middle sister, north sister, south sister, and then bachelor's where everybody goes and skis and then broken tops right there. So I filmed it and I'm like, I tagged my brother Taylor and I'm like, Hey, can we knock off all five of these peaks in 24 hours?

Speaker 2:          01:06:59       And uh, and it would be, I mean, it would be a test, you know, and she commented and said she wants to, she joined us, she wants to come do it. So I mean, I just love that. I don't, I don't even, she's a, she's amazing. But that type of, I mean, I guess I kind of goes hand in hand with the eating. Whatever you want is also doing whatever you want. You know, like a lot of these elite athletes, they, they would be like, have a schedule of races and my training and this and that and I, you know, whatever. I like that she's would just say, yeah, I'll do that. Yeah. It's not a race, it's just we're just having fun. Yeah. Or just a test. It's a, it's an unofficial test and to, for her to want to join in. That's probably what I love the most about her and I are there established trails that you guys could run over all those peaks.

Speaker 2:          01:07:49       Um, we did the south sister in the middle sister last year and now it's uh, getting off the south sister towards the middle sister is sketchy. It's, there's no trails. No. Oh, so you just run it through the woods? It's on the side. There's no trees. It's all inside of a mountain. So it's like a shale and oh, even more sketchy. Yeah. I'd rather run over trees yet. Sort of now you would because you know if there's trees are there solid ground there. Right. You know, so with, with the rocks up there, you don't know what's going to happen, but you got to be stepping over shit. If there's trees there, you might want it to a bunch of places where all the trees have fallen down generally. Yeah. I mean there can be a windfall in there, but generally you can get on animal trail and find your way through, you know, but when it's just rocks, that's what, that's probably the most sketchy cause.

Speaker 2:          01:08:38       Yeah. Cause just because there's a, you know, I don't know, a thousand pound rock sitting there, it could just just be balanced perfectly. You might step on it. That could be, there's no guarantee that those rocks are staying there, you know, falls all the time. So that's with rocks and that type of country, super steep. It's a, as part of it, it's fascinating to me that that is the appeal of sheep hunting too, a lot of people is that it's so incredibly dangerous that being up in those high peaks and stepping on shale, like on these, these crazy peaks where to the left is just a, a steep drop off to the right is a steep drop off and you have a very narrow place to navigate. Yeah. It's uh, you know, she punning they say it's not the, it's not the animal that's the most wary.

Speaker 2:          01:09:28       It's just the country that makes it so, I mean, they're expensive that the hunts, but it was just what they did to that. It's just where they live is the draw, you know, there, I think with the bow, definitely a tough animal with a rifle. Mostly it's just kind of getting in. If you can get your body within a range, you know, you can usually get one done. But it's, it's just where they live. Yeah. When, um, um, Ben O'Brien and a green tree, we're hunting tar. Yeah. Similar thing New Zealand. Then these crazy peaks and super dangerous sketchy territory and people, it's fascinating to me how people get addicted to incredibly difficult things. They do it. They say, fuck, I'm never doing this again because it's terrible. And then they get back in a couple of weeks later, they're like, shit, I don't want to go back. Yeah. It's a god.

Speaker 2:          01:10:22       I don't know what, I don't know what type of analogy to make, but um, you know, if you, when you've done say maybe ultras are marathons, it's really hard to get excited for a five k, you know what I mean? When you do your key Pam and five k, how boring is that for you? Uh, I, to me this is more about the people then. Yeah. It's not for me. I'm not that stupid. Race is the reason why I got started running. I couldn't believe how hard it was to do with zero running folks. Zero. I ran zero and then I ran a five k. Yeah. And at the end of that I was like, okay, I gotta start running shit. Yeah. And it feels great now, right? Yes it does. There's nothing, nothing that feels better to me than being older run. I mean, you know what's crazy is my endurance for kickboxing is way better. Yeah. I mean way better. Way Better. Like I could do a hard three minute round.

Speaker 3:          01:11:14       No problem. Yeah. And it's just from running these fucking hills changes your lung capacity. Yeah. Your lungs just expand and then contract and you just used to get any more oxygen in there, I guess. Yeah. Well still it's true. You've seen those trails that I'm running on to. It's so, they're so steep. It's so much of it is just pushing, pushing, pushing, pushing. It's like you're sprinting up these hills and you're, your body's just used to those bursts, you know? And so now when I go crazy on the heavy bag, I buy, buy, buy, buy, boom. And then the bell would go off and I'm like, oh good. It's crazy. Like it's amazing. It's, and it does so much for your legs to Oh yeah. People always ask me, you know, what I do for legs? And it's like I just run mountains. I mean, and it's, you know, yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:11:58       There was a famous kickboxer from Montreal, his name was John Eve terrio. He was like the most scary kickboxer in the world in the PKA karate days. And uh, all he did was he would run stairs. Like that was the, the big workout that he ran. He wrote a book on training and uh, you know what it takes to be a world champion. And one of the things that he's saying is you got to run stairs. He's like running stairs. He's like, have been the best thing for his kicking power for his endurance, for the, I remember thinking that. And you're just talking about how just put inches on his thighs and it's just, it radically increased his lung capacity and kicking power. Speaking of, uh, endurance, I dunno if we were, but I will. But Francis and Ghana, he got gassed out. He did well.

Speaker 3:          01:12:45       He tried to take steep pay out in the first round. He, that was his, his thought was that steep pace, not going to be a survivor. Didn't happen. It's not good. It's fucked. Yeah. And he doesn't know how to wrestle that. Well. He's doesn't have, he doesn't have a long background in, uh, in martial arts at all. And Steve Bay was a very good college wrestler and obviously a bad motherfucker, you know, he took some hard shots to, he did. You know, that's the thing about Steve paid. It's not just that he knows how to fight, it's, he's just fucking tough. It's just, there's a bunch of shit going on there. It's experience. It's just sheer toughness and grit and determination. And he also, he knows how to ride out bad moments. Like Francis had never had a bad moment. Right. He didn't know what the fuck to do.

Speaker 3:          01:13:29       I think most people, I know you, you, you didn't, but I think most people had kind of assumed, oh, Frances is gonna win this fight. I thought it's very possible. Francis could win. The fight. I thought it was very possible that Francis could just newcomb in the first round. He's just so scary. Yeah. Yeah. It just takes one. No, I've never seen anyone in all of my history of watching mma. That's so terrifying with one punch. Yeah. Yeah. And he's just punching to this kicks or you know, they're okay. He's not, but he's not like a, you know, he's not Edson Barboza or someone who could put you to sleep with one kick. He's not kicking people. He's just moving towards you throwing a few kicks maybe. But what he's trying to do is hit you with those giant fucking canned hams that he calls his fists.

Speaker 3:          01:14:14       And even when he was so gassed, he could barely do anything. I was taking up, just taste still one big tired heavy arm could do it. Oh yeah. 100% that guy still has unbelievable potential if he could get it together. But when he needs to do, and this is critical, he needs to work on his ground game, needs to work on his wrestling and he needs to be with a real top flight mma camp who's trains him now he trains with the guy who found him. Um, I forgot the gentleman's name, but uh, the guy's done an amazing job of building his skills up and you know, in five years. And the thing is Frances is so goddamn good that most people, he spars with most people, he fights with our fucked, when buddy runs the top of the food chain and got like Steve Bay, Steve Bay can avoid all the dangerous stuff, drag them into deep water, get his, get him diminished, diminishes his endurance and his ability and then overwhelm them, which is what Steve Bay did.

Speaker 3:          01:15:16       Yeah. But Francis can learn from that. He can learn from that. He can learn from that and he can get better at all those areas that he had problems with. Tired. Yeah. But he can get the endurance is something you can work on. You can work on all those things. I just don't know how. I'm sure he worked hard. I'm absolutely sure, but I don't know how hard he was pushed. So there's a difference between working hard and being pushed, right? Like if you, if he's trained with a guy like Cain Velasquez, for instance, prime time, Cain Velasquez, if keynes in his prime, Kate's taking him down left and right, he's going to try to have to get up all the time. He's doing rounds of cane. You're going through how you get through five minutes of hell, and when that bell goes off to it to end the five minutes of hell, you're just like, Holy Shit.

Speaker 3:          01:15:58       Yeah. You know, you've watched the, the, the training camps with Daniel Cormier and Luke rockhold and Cain Velasquez, some of the footage. There's a reason why those guys are so God damn good because iron sharpens iron. It's right. Those guys are in their world champions going at it with each other on a daily basis and because of that, that's what turned them into those fucking monsters they are today. Yeah. Frances is just a physical freak. Yeah. But if he was in that camp, whole leash shit. Yeah, that'd be, that'd be amazing. It'd be amazing to see what, what he could do. Yeah. I don't know. The problem is sparring with that guy. Like if you're, if Francis spars, the way they spar because dcs, they go hard. Don't go. They go a little hard. Isn't that kind of maybe too hard? That's the argument. Just two arguments. There's one argument is that they're going through that is why they're so successful in world championship fights that they know what to buy. They know what the fire feels like. Yeah. The other thing is that they're also increase their, they get injured a lot. Yeah. That camp gets injured a lot, but it's also, there are so fucking good. Who could, they got hubby. You've never come at off Luke rockhold Daniel Cormier Day

Speaker 5:          01:17:10       cane, motherfucking Velasquez. It's not, you can't argue with that one camp in San Jose. That's because some of the best fighters that have ever done the sport. Then on top of that, Josh Thompson, you know, they had Josh Koscheck for a while and he was at the top of his game. Some fucking killers have come from Aka, so you could look at it two ways. You could say one, they're beating each other up too much or too, that's what you gotta do. You gotta do to be a world champion. It's uh, it's hard to say. I mean, I was still to this day when Kane was in his prime, I never saw a heavyweight like that before ever. The fucking endurance that guy had was off the charts. It's not like nothing. You would see guys just should be overwhelmed. They couldn't imagine how the fuck he could do this.

Speaker 5:          01:17:53       Like where's he getting his second round would come around and have this look on their face and cain would just be like, like you just woke up. Like he's not even, he's not even starting to really sweat. Yeah. Beat the shit out him for the second round. Pete, the shit on for the, they would just wilt under the pressure. Yeah. You see those fights where, I mean not, not him, but I mean even now or, uh, it's just an onslaught and you're just like, man, you feel bad for well that, that uh, who was at the other night, uh, Chanko that did you see that fine. He's just quiet. I was like, can this fight get over? Because they should have stopped that fight a long time. Moodle. I should have been stopped 15 or 20 times. Oh my God. It was brutal. Yeah. Mario Yamasaki said he gave her the opportunity to be a warrior.

Speaker 5:          01:18:39       That's what he said. That was his, his take on it. Oh Man. I mean he was getting beat up, not just beat up the, did you see the stats, the actual physical striking stats, the significant strikes. Did she land any one? Okay. And Valentine, she landed one like, I think it was some unbelievably overwhelming number. Like one versus several hundred in the significant strike department. Like literally shit. Mike landed one pretty decent punch shift. Chank goes, she looked like a guy up there with a big heart, elbows, you know, come into, I mean, just like just power guy. Sexist much. Someone's a fucking sexist. Did you notice that Jamie? Oh Jesus. That's world champion Moy. Tai kickbox. Well it looks like a world champion woman. You son of a bitch. I'm getting, I'm getting read the riot act over here. You gotta be careful these days. People turn on you. I hate that. I hate that. That, that really irritates me. Oh, I think I'm going. Yeah. Why is it wrong to say she looks like a guy? I don't know. She's a woman. You son of a bitch. That's why I would just talking more about the power. Okay. You just don't see women. Um, you know the strikes 95 to two. Oh, but you can still see women like coming down hard like that. Have you before? Um, yeah. Cotsen Guano

Speaker 3:          01:20:08       cats and dogs can do that when they're on that, that, that top position and just raining part. It's just like, I just haven't seen it that often. No, it's, there's not a lot of women that can throw down like that. And I've, Valentino is one of the most well rounded women in the sport. She's, yeah, she subbed Julianna Pena off her back. She, you know, she stands up and out strikes holiday home. She went toe to toe with a Amanda Nunez. She went toe to toe with some of the best kick boxers in the worst. She's a world champion, Moy Thai fighter, and she's just a fucking beast man. Yeah. All around just bad bad ass fighter. There was an argument that she won that the, for the championship against doing is super close fight. I didn't think it was a bad decision, but I thought it was a, it was a very close fight.

Speaker 3:          01:20:58       Yeah. It's hard, you know, and it's hard for me calling fights because of I'm calling them, I'm just looking at what's happening. I'm trying to talk, but I'm not scoring it, you know, I don't score it. Score it. You gotta keep your mouth shut and you should have a piece of paper in front of you. And you know, Eddie Bravo used to do it. Uh, for the UFC, he used to score in between rounds and he had a great system where he would put a line down the center of a paper and it'd be like one opponent on the left side and the other one on the right side. And then he would write down like kicks takedowns submission attempts and all that stuff. And then defense, those are little categories. And they would put checkmarks Hash marks to one. Yeah. And then he would go over why he thought someone won and what kind of score he get.

Speaker 3:          01:21:42       He had a very good system and I think that's the only way to fairly judge a fight. Right. When your class, it's like Valentino Shift Gencos fight where you just go like, what the fuck? I gave her like 10 to two. I mean it was, it wasn't so overwhelming. I mean, yeah, a 10, eight round is a disgrace. It's like a 10, six or if you gave it just a 10, eight, you'd be like, who the fuck are you? [inaudible] Shit, judge you God, that was crazy. Yeah. Yeah. Um, yeah, it's, um, it was a bad matchup because that girl was there, I believe that was her ufc debut. So to have a UFC debut against a woman who has fought for the title against a world class striker, I mean literally one of the very best strikers on the planet earth, male or female and just on, it's not fair.

Speaker 3:          01:22:31       You know, that was her first fight at one 25, wasn't it? Valentina's yes. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, Valentine fought, uh, you want to, you and Jay check in Moitai Thai and uh, so she beat her. Hmm. Um, I think, I think they fought more than once, but I believe Valentino beater. I hope I'm not wrong because I'm around a lot. I'm excited for that arose. Uh, now in unison you want to and Jay check where you met. Yeah. Well, you know rose trains with Valentino. Oh, that's her main sparring. Oh, really? Yeah. Yeah. That's a good camp. Then just those having those

Speaker 5:          01:23:06       two there dough to work off each other. Yeah. Phenomenal. For rose and for Valentino, it's going to be tough for rose to come now as the champion. I don't know. It'd be interesting to see how if it changes at all. Oh yeah. It will definitely be interesting and coming into this fight, what's fascinating to me, even though rose one by first round knockout, she's the the underdog. Yeah. Well it's, I put up that clip of it when she was like saying the Lord's prayer there. When you're up there in years talking about how it was terrifying or something like that. I put up that little quip. It was, that was crazy. Oh, he's no one is from you guys. Yeah. Before on fight night before the fight, you guys were standing there and there. They're showing that from the way in and Oh my God, that was classic.

Speaker 5:          01:23:55       Yeah. She was so in the zone that you wanna was talking shit to where you're going to fuck you up. I'm going to fuck up your bogey. I'm boogie woman. She's talking all this crazy shit to her and rose just going, our father who art in heaven, I won't be that name. Thy Kingdom come, thy will be done. And she was like in this zone where you want to put her fist on her nose. And she didn't even flinch. That was the only one that, and I said because they had something off about fighter of the year I think. But that was, I get fired up for all the fights, but that was the only fight that I was standing up. Like I was cause the Washington at home and I'm just like, oh my God. You know, cause she was landing those that hard punches and it was, I dunno.

Speaker 5:          01:24:38       It's amazing. Yeah. It was amazing. Amazing. A lot of people thought she had a chance by submission because I'm a units is a really good submission artist and she's really fast. Like she'll throw up flying armbars and shit. She's wild. Crazy chances. Yeah. But for her to win by k like that, it was like, holy show it. I know it. I was so pumped when Daniel Cormier just starts yelling out the thug. Oh my God. That was amazing. Yeah. It was one of my favorite moments of doing commentary of be just being next to him while he was yelling that out. Cause it was just pure excitement and appreciation and joy, you know, he's just having a good time. Does he know her then too or do they, I mean they all know each other. Oh, how well not training together? No, I don't believe so.

Speaker 5:          01:25:22       Not the same camp. I mean maybe she's done some training at Aka. I don't, I'm not aware of, but she's, she's in Colorado. She's as Trevor Whitman and uh, her, uh, boyfriend, Pat Barry, who's a worldclass kickboxer, he's a really good a MMA fighter as well. When he remember him fight in the UFC, he had some wild ass fight. He's a serious striker. Pat Barry can fucking crack. I, I remember, I mean, I thought he was fighting. Let's see who was that? And it's like, I thought he was knocked out basically and then landed one big one or maybe it's the other way around. Yeah, he was fine. Check Congo Congo completely out of it. Yes. And he just went in for broke and check Congo caught him with a crazy kod. Yeah,

Speaker 3:          01:26:04       that was it. I remember that fight. That was nuts. It was nuts. But that's just how pat fights. He's a wild man. He just fights wild. Yeah, he's, he was, I remember he was like thick and could punch. Yeah, he's a tank. Yeah. It's ruthless leg kicks. He got some of the best leg kicks I've ever seen. The heavyweight division. Those are, those are those lake you into that I just heard you talk about the other day. But those low leg kicks her new thing nowadays. Yeah. Well Benson Henderson started doing that a long time ago. He was one of the first guys to introduce it to mma. But um, he had some success with it. But not like you've seen today. Like you're seeing guys getting debilitated like really quickly. It must be a new, so it's a weak spot for on humans, I guess. Well, a hard discipline. Their loans that Moitai fighters known about forever, that MMA fighters are just starting to figure out the same as with kickboxing and karate.

Speaker 3:          01:27:00       There's a lot of karate moves that MMA fighters don't, are not good at, but karate guys are and karate guys come into mma like Steven Tompkins, uhs, Thompson Thompson's, wonderboy, wonderboy, Tompkin, Tom, she keeps saying Tompkins cause of Sean Tompkins. Uh, but a wonderboy is doing things from a sideways karate stance that a lot of people aren't just don't know how to handle. Like wonderboy has these crazy front leg side kicks in front leg roundhouse kicks. Like if you ever watched his fight with a Johnny Hendricks is one of the best examples. He hits Johnny Hendricks, the gut with a sidekick. And then Johnny Hendricks cause is still there. So he roundhouse kicks him in the face with the same leg and you see Johnny, he's like, what in the fuck? Cause it's just something like, it's amazing to see that and training. You don't know a lot of guys that you have to get a really good karate guy and most really good karate guys.

Speaker 3:          01:27:55       He's just gonna be able to take them down. Yeah. But you know, wonderboy is just got that style just dialed in and nailed and he moves like a snake from the waist. Like he moves backwards from the weight, like he gets away from Shit and then fires back at Ya. He looked good and that last fight, yeah, it gets jorge him on speed dial. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So that's a different style. And so these, these techniques, like he's exceptionally good at those karate techniques and a lot of people aren't. And so with Moitai most of the time when guys were learning more time, bringing it into mma, they were doing a few things. They were throwing the leg kicks, they were throwing the knees to the body, the elbows, normal, normal Moitai techniques. But they're missing some of the subtleties. So some of the better Moyie Thai fighters started training with some of the better MMA fighters. And then slowly but surely those techniques started leaking in. I see. And then the big one now is that low like Kik, that low leg kicks motherfucker, man, it just takes out your, you can't condition your lower leg. That's what I'm saying. It's in, it feels like it's a weeks. I mean, cause I know, uh, Michael Chandler, he got

Speaker 5:          01:29:02       caught with that and that's how we lost the belt and kill the nerves in his legs. And it's like, it looked like his leg was broke, his ankle is flopping all around. You could, you would swear that that leg was broke and it must've just been those low leg kicks down there and just deaden the nerve. Yeah. It's amazing. It's amazing. How many, um, how many fighter like, um, Gilbert Melendez, uh, when he fought Jeremy Stevens, Jeremy Stephens cracked him real early in the first round without low leg kick and you see it immediately swelling up and then Gilbert has fallen down on it. He keeps, can't stand up on it. It's crazy. Yeah. Douglas Lema and Rory Macdonald, Rory Macdonald in Beltour right into the same thing right into the lower leg. It's, he had a giant Hematoma. He was fucking huge. Yeah. Yeah. It's a devastating technique. Yeah. Well, it's interesting.

Speaker 5:          01:29:52       It's, I just love that. I love when new elements get brought into this very complex sport. Yeah. I mean, and that's like, yeah, that, that's just been an a new one for sure. Um, but this Saturday, are you going to be at the keep hammering run this Saturday just to keep hammering run where? Salt Lake. I didn't know there was one. No, no. I'm going to be here now. Remember that? Uh, you went to that show? Yeah, I did go to that show. I just went to that show by accident. The western hunting close doesn't town skiing, which I fucking hate. Yeah. I don't hate skiing, but I'm not a fan. This is boring. You just dislike it a lot. I just don't get it. Every time I do it, I'm like, maybe this time I'm going to get it. There's going to be the day where I'm an employee.

Speaker 5:          01:30:35       I'm going to be in bliss. I'm going to slide down that mountain. People who goose cause you knew a good, I did it for five years. I got pretty good at it. I didn't get good at it. Like I couldn't enter a skiing competition, but I don't fall down anymore. I know how to stop. I know how to ski. I just don't get it. So I was there and then I was like, what? There's a hunting expo and I fucking snuck away for a day. I had a great time with you. It was like, this is so much better. Yeah. So that's this weekend that show. Oh, and you have a keep hammering run in Utah. Where's it at? It's a, if it's the same place as last year, it's this, right? I mean, we started the capital there in Salt Lake Capitol building, and then you run a five k from there.

Speaker 5:          01:31:15       Oh, okay. Yeah. So it's a Saturday morning. I'm a big fan of salt lake. I love that town too. It's fucking great. Yeah. I mean it takes people, man. All I know there are so nice. The best. I mean, I know, it's weird. There's a lot of Mormons there. I know people get weirded out by more ways. Did the nicest people. They're so nice. Like I don't care what wacky shit you believe. As long as you're nice. That's it. Yeah. Just be nice. That's it. Yeah. So that's uh, I'm excited it's going to be, uh, I think we were hoping to have, kind of want to think we had a few hundred last year, so yeah. Nice. As can be. And then, uh, we'll do that Saturday and then we'll be back in September. Oh, cunning. Ooh.

Speaker 2:          01:32:00       Do you remember that? Remember El Canyon in Utah? We only got to 470,000 views. We're going to do a podcast when we get to 500,000. What's it out right now? Jamie? Go to the UAE hunt youtube page. We might have to cancel this son of a bitch. Yeah. We're hoping to do a podcast when it hit 500,000, but it petered out. It did petered out at about four, four 71 to 70. So we got a thousand today, so we just need a few more days. Good. But end of the month. Yeah, we'll cut and close. We'll hit it by the end of the month. Hey. And then, then also, uh, this weekend, um, the secretary of the Interior Zinky on Friday is going to announce a, a a big, I think it's a big win for conservationists and, um, again, we're going to protect the winter migration routes for deer and elk from development. So that's been a big thing that, you know, like, um, I told, I told them when I met with them back in Vegas, I don't know when it was a couple of weeks ago that it feels like we've taken some hits as sportsman, as far as, um, the national monuments being shrunk, you know, and you can argue that both ways, uh, drilling on the, on the coast, you know, a lot of people don't like the prospects of that.

Speaker 2:          01:33:21       So I'm like, man, we could use it when and brought up the winter migration routes and uh, protecting those from, from any development just so those animals can get down and get to the winter range. Um, when food is hard to come by. And so that's, that's going to be announced on Friday that he's going to make that happen. That's awesome. And now you have a position there as well. Like what, what is your official position? That's it. I'm on the International Wildlife Conservation Council, which has, doesn't have anything to do with North America, but I'm just kind of using that as an excuse to talk about North America. It doesn't have anything to do with North America. Now what does it have to do with, uh, with that, that's about like the trophy export ban from Africa. Oh, so international hunting basically. And so it, it's a weighing in on that because it's like if you go to Australia and you shoot some animals, you can't bring the meat back.

Speaker 2:          01:34:20       Um, well, yeah, but that's different. Yeah. It's different. Well, that, that doesn't have anything to do with what's going on right now. It's Africa and like with elephants coming back, so when you can't bring your trophy back, yeah. Who's going to want to go shoot and not just elephants because elephants are a whole different category, but who's going to go want to shoot a gazelle? Well, if you, if you can't bring it back. Yeah. Right. I don't know if those are regulated, but it's mostly elephants and you know, in lions and lions they reversed it. And then trump said, fuck that trump doesn't like it. Which is fascinating

Speaker 3:          01:34:58       because his sons,

Speaker 4:          01:34:59       yeah, big hunters. Right, right. He called it a horror show. He did. And that's what got my attention. It's because he said that he doesn't see how conservation helps elephants, which, okay, that's one thing. But then he said, or any other animals and I'm like, wait a second. Okay. You can't, we can't say conservation hunting as a conservation tool doesn't help any other animals because we've proven here in North America. It's that it's a model that works. So I didn't like how he worded that and lump that all on together. Now Mike was that, I was, was that just a poorly worded tweet? What's going on here? So then he said he's going to look at that ban, um, regarding elephants because, you know, if there's no value on the animals, we know it, we know what happens. Um, and if there is no hunting, it's pretty much the death sentence of the animal.

Speaker 3:          01:35:46       Well, we'd probably have to explain that to a lot of people that don't know what we're talking about. But Africa, there's a lot of animals in Africa that were on the verge of extinction just a few decades ago. And what they did was, it's a very controversial thing to, especially to people that don't hunt. But what they did was they created a lot of these game preserves where they had these animals and they had a financial interest in keeping these animals alive cause people paid a lot of money to come over there and hunt them. So now these animals that were on the verge of extinction just a couple of decades ago are thriving in record numbers, but they get hunted. Yeah. So for people that are concerned about the welfare of these animals and they're they, they're wa wildlife lovers, they're in a weird predicament because it's hunting that's keeping these animals alive.

Speaker 3:          01:36:34       And it seems like a contradiction. Like how could hunting be conservation, right? But even in this country, 11% taxes on, on bullets, on hunting equipment, on all the different things that people buy. And this was a self imposed tax that sportsmen put on the purchase of these goods so that it would go towards wildlife and billions of dollars, billions of dollars have gone to preserving wetlands, preserving wildlife habitat, reestablishing populations of animals and all these different areas where they're diminished. The amount of money that has gone towards conservation from hunters versus from Peta or the humane society or any other welfare group, it's not even remotely comparable.

Speaker 4:          01:37:22       Hunters are making the difference there. And we put our money where our mouth is, you know, we say we care about it, we, we pay for it. We, we put money there to help conservation and pay for the biologists and pay for the studies and pay for habitat enhancement. And so that essentially is the same thing that needs to happen in Africa is, but it's, it's weird to say, well how can the United States regulate what happens in Africa because we can't really, but we can say we're not going to allow the trophies you come home. So that pretty much stops a hunting in Africa. So, yeah, we're not saying you can or can't hunt can still go do it.

Speaker 2:          01:37:55       You just can't bring them home, which essentially stops a hunting without hunting. Those animals don't have value. No. And no matter how you want to slice it or phrase it or whatever you want, if they don't have value, they're not going to, it's going to be the detriment of the animal of the specie. Um, you know, Kenya, they stopped hunting in 1973 and 70% of the animals are gone with no hunting. Yeah. It's very confusing. It's as it seems contradictory. It does. And it's like, uh, you know, I talked to with, um, you know, Zinky about this also. And so that's what this, this council was about to try to make a good decision on how best to regulate the trophies coming home and, and maybe we can help promote hunting and, and how to do a ride and, and what it means, um, as a council.

Speaker 2:          01:38:45       So that's, I'm involved in that. Um, I use that opportunity to talk to them about other things too. But, uh, so I dunno, I dunno where it's all gonna Kinda lead. It's, it's a fascinating subject because elephants are endangered in some parts of Africa, but Africa is an enormous place and in other parts of Africa they have a problem with elephants. Yeah. So going to those places and shooting elephants to most people is a horrific offense. Yeah. So, but the problem is I don't, I don't see the amount of money that someone has to pay to go and shoot an elephant. It's a crazy amount of money. 75,000 that's a lot of fucking money. How many people are spending $75,000 to go look at them or help them? They're not going to, they're not going to know. And so, and when you say, well that money could come from photo safaris?

Speaker 2:          01:39:34       No. And also with the one's going to pay 75 grand to take a picture and for a photo safari, where they have them set up is that they go on the pretty much the same route. So the habitat just gets hammered. I mean, you know what a national monument or a national park here, the most popular places, you know what those look like? Fricking dump. So when you have those photos far as they go on the same track, basically you're hammering the habitat, you're not getting back to the back reaches where the poachers are killing the animals, you know, that's still happening back there. And then to get a pride of lion in tour, you can take pictures of it. They're still going out and shooting zebras and, and, and Paula and in different things. Buffalo throwing them out there. So the, so the lions are, they're eating.

Speaker 2:          01:40:15       So there's still animals dying, but they're just, the animals aren't benefiting from it. So when you think of like in the Bush of Africa, if uh, a farmer there has a crop and there's elephants getting in, they're thrashing his crop, the elephant has no value to them. What has value as a crop? And if the animal, if the elephants in, they're trampling it. He just wants to elfant debt once they've gone. So he's going to shoot, it's going to lay there. It's, you're not going to benefit anybody but his crop grows and that's what happens. It's just very hard for people to look at it that way because they look at it like, no, I don't want an elephant to die. No, I want a lion to die.

Speaker 5:          01:40:54       No, no, no. I don't want a zebra to die and I don't want to draft a die and we can go ahead and shoot that other thing. That wart hog, the ugly thing, nobody gives a fuck about warhawks you can shoot warhawks and smile and take a picture and people are racist. They were racist against certain animals. That's a fact. Oh, for sure. For sure. The fact, is it racism, racism, race of speciesism or you speciest I am. I sent you a video about that. Speciesist that's a fact. But, and people way more than I like goldfish. And, and with regard to lions, you know, so if lions are coming in and killing the goats or whatever that the say in Tanzania that they're raising, they're just going to put, there'll be a dead goat. They'll put poison in it. The, the pride will come in, eat it, they'll go die.

Speaker 5:          01:41:37       Then no more goats are getting killed. All those lines are dead. Well that was one of the things about Zimbabwe, right? Um, was it Zimbabwe where that guy killed that lion? The Cecil? Oh, I think so. Yeah. That place they had to kill a bunch of lions because people stopped lion hunting there. And so because they stopped line hunting there, they had this excess of lions and they were destroying the Angelo population. So they had to go in and just slaughter these lions. Yeah. So the $50,000 per line that they would have made, that would have gone towards all sorts of different things, protection of the habitat, the, the, the different conservation officers that work in that area instead that there's no money and then they actually have to hire someone to go and do that job. Right. And this is the argument about British Columbia as well.

Speaker 5:          01:42:26       This is exactly what's going to happen up there. That the argument that you're getting from the people that are in the field that are out there every day is that what's going to have to happen is you're going to have a bunch of problem bears. They're going to have to hire people that go out to these problem bears and it's incredibly expensive and very, very dangerous. Yeah. And bears are going to die. Yeah. So still still going to have of them. Some of them are still going to die. Yeah. But animals are going to die. You know what I mean? Do you get mad when a bear kills an antelope or when a bear kills a giraffe or, right. Well, they don't really, they're not over there. But if they were over here, you know, if a bear kills a Moose, are you upset? Are you only upset when a person killed a moose?

Speaker 5:          01:43:03       Right. And you know, in Africa too, and so those animals are dying. Um, and w when it's hunters that are doing it, the numbers are very controlled. The harvest is very controlled. You can take x amount of animals out and this money will go towards, you know, this enhancement of a waterhole, this pain for um, the anti poaching unit, which when I was over there was $1,000 a day to pay for guys to come in to, to control, keep the poachers out of there without that money. Um, none of that's happening. So there instead of having a very regulated harvest number, the poachers will kill hell over mini. Yeah. And let's be honest about it, the vast majority of the money is going towards whatever lodge, the owners of that for sure area. But they're also hiring people. They are hiring people, but they have a financial incentive to keep these animals alive.

Speaker 5:          01:43:54       It's very peaceful. It's very problematic for a lot of people. They don't like to hear it. And I've, I've read this article that's ridiculous article that said that that's not true, that trophy hunting is not what sustains these animals. And you know, you can get just as much from a safari. Like that's not true. What you're saying is not true. That CNN thing handled it pretty well. Did you watch that tracks? What did you think about that? Um, no, I, I'm a hunter. Said some stupid shit. I didn't God, you know, I mean, we talked about this earlier in the podcast, you know, when people say, Oh, you just want to go kill stuff and this and that. I didn't really like when whoever the hunter was, I don't know. It's probably a nice guy. But he shot a crocodile and he says, yeah, mother effer.

Speaker 5:          01:44:36       And I'm like, what is going on there? I wouldn't know. I've never done anything like that and that, that seemed, that isn't like the honorable hunter that I know, you know? So that seems a little weird. I don't like crocodiles. I might say. Yeah, mother fucker. If I shot the crocodile crocodile, scare the shit out of me. I'm here. The one thing that scares me more than any, pretty much any animal on the planet. Yeah, I know. I just, I, I still feel a lot of respect for the animal. I'm joking around most of the, I know, I know, but I did just seem like a weird reaction to me. Well, especially knowing that the world is going to see that reaction. Yeah. I mean, if he was just by himself and he said that, and that was an honest reaction and who's still had respect for the animal and it was just the fact that he pulled it off.

Speaker 5:          01:45:18       Yeah. It's unfortunate. It's unfortunate as, uh, it's unfortunate to broadcast that for the world to see. Yeah. I thought, I thought it could have been a lot worse with regard to how hunters were portrayed. You know, I mean, um, even the guy who killed the lion, he did get emotional. Um, he showed some reverence there, which, which I liked. Um, it could have been worse. Uh, they talked about how it's animals are, I guess a commodity in some respects with the rhinos. You know, they, I think that guy had 1500 rhinos, didn't he, on his property and uh, you know, so what's better, 1500 rhinos for him to have and raise and cut off the horns or zero. Yeah. You know, it's better to have 1500. Right? Yeah. Well, it's definitely better for the population of rhinos as a whole because people don't like the idea of raising something as a commodity, raising wildlife as a commodity.

Speaker 5:          01:46:12       I understand that. Do you ever see the Louis through documentary about wildlife in Africa about those, I forget what it was called, but you can watch it on youtube. That to me was a, a better piece. And one of the most interesting things, because Louie is a, he's a very smart guy, but he's also a very nice guy. He just kept asking questions and pestering people and getting to the heart of it. But he also showed like these fenced in Lyons and they're throwing a dead cow over the top of the fence. And the lines have been tearing it apart. It's fucking crazy. I didn't see it. But it's, it's weird because the, these lions, they're never like, they're feeding

Speaker 3:          01:46:50       him and then people go over there and hunt them as if it's like a wild lion.

Speaker 2:          01:46:54       Yeah, it's, it's super weird. I couldn't hunt and offense. Um, I cannot align in a fence. Um, so I don't know. Yeah. It,

Speaker 3:          01:47:05       it's not what we call over here in America. Fair Chase, right? There's a, a term, that term fair chase is synonymous with ethical hunters in America. And this is something that most people aren't aware of that there's a code and that code the code very slightly. Like in some places you can use electronic communication, meaning you can use walkie talkies to locate an animal. Like a, I believe you can do that in Arizona. You definitely could do that in Nevada. You can't do that in Montana. You know, there's, there's different things of what people decide. It's fair chase or ethical and it depends. Like Colorado, they won't even let you use a, a light on your site, on your both site can have any electronics, uh, attached to your site for whatever reason. They just started allowing lighted nocks

Speaker 2:          01:47:51       well that was just an Oregon too, or they've been outlawed in Oregon I think. I mean, I haven't used them in Oregon, but, uh, I think they are legal now. But yeah, I mean as far as, so you're trying to define what is fair chase. Right. And so yeah, there's a lot of these electronics, this or that. But what we say is fair chase is not in a high fence.

Speaker 3:          01:48:09       Well it's definitely not feeding a lion in a cage and then opening up the door. Right when the hunter pulls up, that is due to, Oh yeah, that is what they do. It's one of the reasons why a lot of these lines that get shot, they don't know what the fuck is going on. They're bedded somewhere. They just lay down cause they're outside in this new environment. Like where am I? And even know what it is because they've been living in this very small environment and they let them out and they let him out right when the hunter gets,

Speaker 2:          01:48:35       yeah, that's, that's tougher to justify. It's very tough to justify. It's, I, I feel like it's, it's, it's not justifiable. Yes. You're not hunting anymore. You're just murdering an animal. Yeah. So I'm murder. Murder is a person right now, so I'm going to, I'm going to not address that part and just address hunting in general and hunting in general is what's necessary for the, the future of animals. I mean, you had until it gets down to a number where maybe the white or black or whatever rhino that is, that's only down to a hound handful. Obviously you're not going to hunt those. But by and large, hunting is what keeps these animals, the population viable. Well, and then there was also the case of Corey Knowles who went over there and Knowlton no, Nolan. Corey Knowlton Knowlton. Yup. Does that he say his name? Yup. Sorry, Corey. Corey Knowlton. We got it. Why does he noise? But yeah, I have too many names in my head. But anyway, when cory went over there in cornerstone, the hotspot smoking. You think so? No, but that's what people like to say, right? Yeah. People would see a lot of stupid shit. Seven pop quiz motherfucker. Shit. But when cory went

Speaker 5:          01:49:48       over there, he spent a quarter of a million dollars to shoot an endangered rhino, think it was 350,000 was it that much? I mean it was a lot, a lot of money, hundreds of thousands of dollars. And he said that it was undervalued and he said the reason why the bidding didn't get higher it was because there was so much pressure on people to do it. But he explained very eloquently and very clearly on CNN and when he did my podcast about all the death threats that he got, what he said, listen, that rhino was killing other rhinos. That is why not breeding, not breeding. It was, it was an old rhino that was past its breeding prime. It wasn't breeding anymore and it was killing the young rhinos. He had killed a female that had tried to mate with and it had killed another male and it was, they were, these was, this is an endangered animal and this thing was killing other animals.

Speaker 5:          01:50:39       They had decided, look, we have to take this out of the population, so what is the best money for it to get a tremendous amount of money that could go for anti poaching efforts and all these different things. And so he explained it like, he's like, this is, this is an animal that they were going to kill. They had to kill it because it was threatening this endangered population of only like a couple of thousand rhinos. Right, right. Yeah. It's a really interesting situation. And people would like it if that wasn't the case, they would like it if no, the money is actually coming from animal welfare groups and from wildlife lovers who just want to see these animals alive. The difference is it's very rare that someone is going to give you $350,000 to keep a rhino a lot. Huh. And so that, that's a magnified example, but that's pretty much what's happening with all the animals.

Speaker 5:          01:51:31       I mean, you're not getting that much money, but you're getting money in exchange for their life, basically. And it's for the betterment of the herd. Yeah. I mean, that's hunting. Yeah. Right? I mean, that's, that's like, like I said, very magnified because you're getting a huge amount of money and there's only a few animals, but you can, it's easy to see, hey, killing this one is going to save animals. So that's really easy to see. But that's pretty much what happens with all animals. I mean, you're balancing that heard. The other thing is they ate that rhino and a lot of people at that Rhino, I mean, they give you a need a way to villages and people don't know you. You not only can you eat rhinos, apparently they taste good. Same thing with elephant. Elephant apparently tastes delicious. Well, do you remember in the trophy movie they, they could care less what elephant that guy killed, but they didn't like that it was small. Right? Do you remember that in me? Because they wanted more meat. They don't care about, they want it. They care about eating. Yeah, that's it. So as far as the locals go, I mean, so we here in America, it feels like, you know, we take up these causes and it's like, you know, we're the social justice warriors for the world. It's like we ought to probably check in with the people that actually live there, right? Yeah. They want to kill the lions.

Speaker 3:          01:52:46       Jesus Christ. He sees a kid. There was a, an article in the New York Times shortly after the, the Lion Cecil the lion controversy. It said a in Zimbabwe. We did not cry for lions. Right. I know that. Read that one. Yeah. No, that's, and that's, that's real life. I mean, over here, everything, Lion, king, everything lives everybody's friends. But Simba is my friend. Yeah. No one's saying that. Lions need to die. No, I look, I'm not in favor of those high fence things and the way they keep those lines. A lot of things you've told me before, you wouldn't have on, no, I'm right. No desire. Right. So, but you understand teen and how it works and, and how, what we need. Yeah. You know, it's just a weird facet of human nature that we've sort of boxed ourselves into this situation with Africa. But Africa I think is, you could look to that example and, and see how it's is a very complex issue.

Speaker 3:          01:53:44       Especially, let's take all the woods. Steve Rinella calls the charismatic megafauna out of the equation like giraffes, which everybody loves. Like I had a whole bit about giraffes and one of my comedy specials that they're, the one animal that you can't say is like, is not better off in the zoo. Yeah. Because like other animals, they look like captive. They're contained. But giraffes are so happy babies freedom. Like I used to take my kids to the zoo when my daughter was, I don't even think she was two. She's holding out of a piece of lettuce and a fucking giraffe comes out to hedge huge giant Tang wraps around the lettuce and takes it from, and she's giggling and laughing, but they're so confident in giraffe behavior that they let babies feed them. Yeah. That's impressive. Or animal like that. And the zoo. No, because animals are wild animals, you know, done all that they're going to do.

Speaker 3:          01:54:39       But what I said was that a giraffe wakes up every day in the zoo and goes another day with no lions. That's true. And just sort of wanders around the zoo having a, they look like they're having a blast, but they have not a care in the world. They don't mind at all being in that fence long as you keep chucking that, hey, over the side there are good. Keep it coming. Keep dead. Hey, come on baby. Yeah, good to go. We have connections with certain animals. Elephants are a big one, you know? Um, lions are a big one. Giraffes for whatever reason are a big one. Even zebras, people like, why are you shooting at a zebra? It's too much like a horse. Yeah. Like we have these, but if it's like an antelope like that, you eat like, oh, that kinda makes sense. Yeah. Like we have these kind of makes sense animals. And again, wart hogs. Nobody gives a fuck about warthogs. There's no one out there trying to save the Warhawk. People don't even know how many there are. They don't care and care less. No. This is not like people worried about lions and no one is out there wondering how many ward hogs are all left in Africa. I see it all the time. It's like people will comment, not hunters, IVC, but they'll be like on my page and say, well, oh,

Speaker 2:          01:55:44       I don't have a problem if you kill deer and elk, but there's no reason to kill a bear. Right. What are you talking about? Have you ever had bear sausage? Yeah. Well, if you've had bear saw and you, you probably happen. But if you, if, if you have, it's Goddamn good. And why is it any different? It's the same. Why is it any different? Yeah, it's not. Yeah, so it's just what they're, it's just what they're ingrained to feel about an animal, I think. Well, they, they seem to dog like, so yeah, that's a thing. That's the thing with people that bears or seem dog like, oh well they're portrayed as being nice and the people have them for pets too. Like there's a lot of people that have bears pets, like a of Russian design up people and man on instagram. Do you have lunch?

Speaker 2:          01:56:27       Fine. Them. This is one motherfucker as a giant grizzly bear that he cuddles with and people keep sending me videos of this guy. I'm like, one day, I know I say this video is going to get dark. God. Yeah, look at this guy. It's got a sweet bear. Just chilling with this bird, this bird month moon. When we hung out, my girlfriend, no rubbers back, but one day my baby. Yeah. Oh yeah. It looks like it looks like a cool bear. It's dope bear. Look, they're fucking awesome animals man. I love all of them. Yeah. But here's the deal. If you had a thousand of those living in your neighborhood, you'd have to thin the herd. Yeah. You just have to, and the reality of all this stuff is super complex and I just do not think you get an understanding of it from, you know, in front of your laptop in Vancouver.

Speaker 2:          01:57:21       You just, you don't know for sure. What I like is, uh, you know, with regard to like this international wildlife council or even, um, it just seems like with this administration and people say good or bad or mostly bad, it feels like you're listening to about, and that's what, that's one thing that I would read cnn and I listened to fight. It's like the same topic, two totally different slants. So it's like what the hell? Who Do you believe? So that's why I was happy to be involved so I can actually hear. But still it's still hard. It's still hard to listen and think, okay, so what's going on? But, but with my whole thing is like, I kind of look at it is if I got somebody online giving me advice or you give me advice, I'd be like, well Joe knows me. I'm going to listen to him.

Speaker 2:          01:58:14       That's why I kind of want her to be involved in these councils and in this part of this decision making because they can listen to all of this people talking shit all day. But if I'm there and can actually weigh in, we'll then they know me. And, and you know, it might, it should weigh a little more and they know your experience. Right? And so that's why I want to be involved. I'm not saying I'm going to agree and it's going to be exactly what I wanted every time. But, you know, I don't know how else

Speaker 4:          01:58:42       to do it. I don't know how else to do it. And I know that with my voice because, you know, they have trusted me about whatever. Even if they agree or don't agree, I'll at least get to share my thoughts. And so that's what I did. You know, like when I talked with Zinky the other day, what does he like? That's what he's an avid hunter, right? Yeah. That's what, you know, and I've read all these man, you'd think he was the word just like trump, you know, people, you'd think they were saddened to some people. But to me, um, I read the outside magazine article on them. It sounded terrible and I was like, God, that's not good. I read a few other things about them. I'm like, but to me personally is seamed, would listen. Um, seemed like somebody who, if we were sitting there talking about something and we came to a decision and it made sense, that's what it seemed like, like a normal, you know, a well thought out person.

Speaker 3:          01:59:37       Well I think he's probably got a tremendous amount of pressure on him from a bunch of different angles for sure. All interested in making money for sure. And they think of someone that is pro wildlife as being a roadblock to the money. Yeah. Like, Oh, this fucking green house loving hippy tree hugging asshole.

Speaker 4:          01:59:58       He, what he told me is he's concerned he wants to increase hunting opportunities and you know, um, public land opportunities, you know, so that's, and that's kind of what I want to hear. So I mean, maybe what would of who you're talking to. I understand that, but it sounds as sounds good. I mean, it gave me a better feeling talking to them then reading the other articles and the articles about him. Right. So, uh, and then the, his staff, great people, like I said, just like we'd sit here and talk and it makes sense. And even talking with Donald Trump jr I'd be like, God, I wish we could just do this right now. Because it's like you can actually come to a consensus, make a decision, talk it through and be like, that's how it should be, you know? And it seems, it feels like it's different. Politics are different because everybody, like you said, there's pressure from different places. But when I think of a politician, I think, you know, special interest groups and these other people that, that are influenced him and you're wondering why is this for their own benefit? And so you don't really know with this, it doesn't feel like that. It feels like it's trying to make the right decision, you know, without being influenced. I know there's always gonna be influenced, but without like the special interest type influence,

Speaker 3:          02:01:20       I don't know. You know, I think the more people like you that are involved in this and the more people like you have a say, or at least, or they'd come to you for advice, you're going to get it at least a more balanced perspective of what the potential hazards are and what's important. What we need to concentrate on. You know, I think regardless

Speaker 5:          02:01:40       of what you sing about trump, what people were excited about about him as a president would be that the economy would have an upswing and it did. But lately the last couple of days has been a massive decline in the stock market. Has been yesterday I think was the biggest loss ever. I don't understand the stock market. I really don't get it at a bunch of assholes throwing their hands in the air. There's computers that are doing a lot of the calculation that's going on. It's too fucking confusing. I feel like if I just went down that rabbit hole, I'd be stuck studying the stock market for weeks upon weeks and I just don't have that kind of time. Dude, I gotta play techno hunt with Cam hands. Well and I like, I like reading stuff. Like, you know, the stock market's at an all time high and he's making money.

Speaker 5:          02:02:23       That's all I heard. I heard that. Nothing but that. Like jobs, like more jobs than ever, you know? Unemployments and all time low. I'm like, well, you know, when you have a guy who was just so hell bent on making money in business, it's good for business. Right. So like that would be the benefit of having a guy like that. But then apparently there's some downsides to that shit and the downsides are inflation and a panic. And then once the stock market starts going south and people start freaking out, then it really goes south and now it's really gone south. Well last couple of days. I mean it's like I live in the moment and campaigns. I'm not here for your fucking rosy view of the future. Sorry, I don't even understand the stock market. I don't understand it. Yeah. I like, I like hearing good news. That's what I like hearing.

Speaker 5:          02:03:13       Yeah. I like, I like I get comforted here and people that, that uh, I'm not wondering about what their intentions are. So, um, that's why I enjoyed the discussions with those guys. And Yeah. You know, if I can, if you know, I just said, you know, it feels like as sportsman we took a couple of hits, we could use something on the positive side and I think we're getting that on Friday. So that's so on Friday are they gonna make new rules in terms of what you can bring back and what you can't bring back the idea behind it? No, that's not about the international. This is about the, the core doors. Yeah. Right. So protection per protecting migration routes for the big game animals here. That's very, it's very important. Yeah. Especially for animals like mule deer whose populations aren't really that good. But now, yeah, the elk elk still need to be able to get out of the high country out from, you know, where they breed down when the weather, when the weather hits to get down to where the feed is and if there's a bunch of gas rigs in there, knock me able to do it.

Speaker 5:          02:04:14       Do you follow Gritty Bowman on instagram? You Do, right? Yeah. Brian was taking all these videos of elk in evergreen. Hell, I know. Wander right through town. And they're huge. These people are just hanging out near cars. I know they have zero fear of people I know. And they know that once they're in the town that's like they're on home base there. They're safe. It's weird how they know that, you know. Oh, I know. I did. I did see that there are some nice animals in their crazy beautiful people pulled over just checking them out and they're screaming and running. We're that they just migrate right through the town. Yeah. So they probably figured out a long time ago, Hey, just keep waving the car isn't nobody fucks with you. We're good to go. But you know, they have weird rules in evergreen where you could kind of hunting your backyard.

Speaker 5:          02:05:01       Oh really? I didn't know that. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. If you want a certain amount of property, I think it's like more than an acre. He could fucking check, boom. Watch right in your backyard. You had a full freezer then. Yeah, I mean, I think that's exactly why they made those rules. Um, I think it's by section, you know, by unit, depending upon where you're at. Right. But in some places you, you literally can hunt in your backyard. So I would imagine the elk avoid those places. I would think so. They live pretty quick. Isn't it interesting they learn quick? Well that's the one of the things that they said about reintroduction of wolves into yellowstone, they figured it out after awhile. They look okay. Like for in the beginning they were just sitting ducks. Yeah. You know, but that was in the 90s and now we're in 2018 it's essentially the ecosystem has sorted itself out and there's some good arguments that it's sorted itself out for the better.

Speaker 5:          02:05:54       Yeah. You know, which is, you know, for the betterment of other wildlife, other plant species of the elk word, you know, eating a shit load of them. So it's, it's interesting, but also you should know that where they brought those wolves back, you can't hunt. Right. Cause this, the greater yellowstone eco systems, like it's all protected. Right. So maybe they needed him there. Yeah. It's hard to say. Yeah. Just don't bring them Colorado fuckers. Don't do it. There you go. Tell him to it. So what else are you going to discuss with Zinky? How often do you meet? Like what does this job entail or this position entails on that? Council says there's, you meet twice a year. So I didn't really know what about or when that's going to happen. But, uh, for me and my, my whole thing is like, well, if I want to get to know somebody, I like to have them do what I do.

Speaker 5:          02:06:48       It's like you. And so he says he has a bow and I'm like, you. I said, what kind of bow? He told me kind of battle. I'm like, what kind of, uh, I said, uh, what did he have? Like a horse got one. Now it's an old ball. Oh really? God, I can eat like a high country, something like that, that, something like that. But I'm like [inaudible]. So anyway, I said, well, I said, you want to shoot that Bo? He's like, yeah. I said, well, I'll hook them up with hoyt. I'll, I'll, they can't take any gifts. Oh, I can't take gifts. So I said, I said, cause I said that and I, and uh, I said, well, don't worry about that. I go to shoot your bow. I said, how about if I come back in a two d c there and we, and we shoot bows and can't give, you can't give him a gift as a friend. I don't know that it's maybe from a would be an issue.

Speaker 2:          02:07:36       It's pretty regulated. Oh, that makes sense. Taking whatever you can only take bribes under the table. Take gifts, can't have that actual bow. Isn't that funny? You could take campaign contributions. Yeah. But not about, you can't take a boat. You could have lobbyists that are on staff that are trying to get cached and working those special interest groups. Come on baby. Well, so next is a bow we talked about next week, me gone back there and shooting bows with him. Yep. And talking just about whatever, you know, just kind of helmet, want to see his form. That has, right. So, uh, we're trying to make that happen. And, uh, I just, you know, like I said, if you have somebody's ear, you just want to be able to tell them what's important to you and that's all I want to do. But I can do that generally better over something I care about, like archery or running or lifting weights or whatever like that.

Speaker 2:          02:08:27       So that's my goal just to, you know, share what's what, because I feel like I have a pretty good pulse on what's important to sportsmen and hunters here in North America. And, uh, so I just want to share that. Well, I know Donald Trump junior is an avid archer. Like he's really into it. He's an avid hunter plate. Yeah. And He, you got a chance to talk to him? Yeah. Yeah. Uh, quite a quite a while. Yeah. He wants to do the podcast, this podcast. Yeah. So he, he, you know, me, me, you and him can talk, uh, talk about hunting. Okay. We're in dawn, so they smoke weed first, for sure.

Speaker 2:          02:09:11       Oh, for sure. No total normal. I mean, cause that possible. How's it possible that you grow up with Donald Trump as your dad? You've got a golden toilet bowl. When that little kid, that's what I said, I said, you know, I go, cause I, I haven't met any of of uh, Donald's kids except for Don Jr. So I'm like, well, but I follow them on Instagram, you know, you kind of get it. I do to kind of a sort of a feel for what the, I said, man, I go, you know, in talking to you, I said it, it seems weird to say, but seem like a normal gun, which is your dad's a billionaire. I don't know. Is he a billionaire? Right. Oh yeah. So doesn't that seem, it seems surprising. He's like, seems like just like we would be right. Total normal. I mean he's, I fall on my instagram.

Speaker 2:          02:10:00       I see that the pictures of his daughter, super cute, the fishing pictures, but I saw him on Tucker Carlson the other night and I told them this and we were talking in Vegas and he was like, just laying it down for a one minute clip on instagram on Tucker Carlson was to Fox News and laying it down. And I was like, God, I never really had followed his political or is his public speaking type life. So I was like, holy crap, this guy is pretty dialed in. It's probably the plan it takes over when he might retire, you might, I mean, he's 40 so he's just kind of getting his feet

Speaker 5:          02:10:33       under slides right in and that world and trump dynasty just like they did with the bushes. That's right. Just know all of up Clinton's clenches. You know, once you're in there, it's like that's all they want is not interesting. It's crazy. But he, I would feel, I mean man, well that's what said electrical guy. I wish the don junior was running for president. Yeah, he's don junior is very reasonable. Oh Man. Totally. Totally funny if he, if he says one thing wrong, one thing, one slip up of a word, which by the way, everybody does every day. I do it every day. Yeah, me too. One one slip up of the word Corey Knowlton right. One fuck up like that. And then this done, I mean, you see all this, this magnified, ridiculous hate that comes his way. And the attacks against him. And people are people right now listening to this, probably yelling at them because they're fucking Joe's to Ford.

Speaker 5:          02:11:28       Here's a show. It's yet. Yeah, they, it's, it's, I mean it is really hard not to get pissed off. What's really hard to be unbiased? It's really hard to just have enough amounts perspective. And I don't think anybody does a good job as president. I've never seen a single person do it well. I've seen Obama give very good speeches. I think he's very statesman. Like I think he's, he's very, what Obama did that was a excellent was he was very composed and articulate and smooth and he represented a highly educated, like a high level of human being in terms of his intellect and the way he carries himself. And I think that that's good for the country, you know? But I think the way you look at the drone attacks, you look at the attacks on, on whistle blowers and on the press, and there was a lot of bad shit about the Obama administration and everybody wants to sleep sweep under the rug because I think nobody's a good president.

Speaker 5:          02:12:27       I think it's a terrible job at it. I didn't like how he, he sort of started a war on cops. You remember when he was, you know, cruise fine, some of the arrest they had and it started, people were looking at cops thinking, these are the good guys are the bad guys. I didn't like that because maybe there are some bad cops, but there's bad. Everything you do, every job has bad, whatever. So hundred percent. Instead of highlighting that people out there protecting our interests in, in serving the public, he was highlighting the quote, bad cops I guess, and it put them all in a bad light. I didn't like that. Whereas trump, he knows, you know, he's highlighting good police work. He's highlighting the military. He's, you know, pride in, in Ah, the good old United States of America. I like that. So I mean, I dunno. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          02:13:16       Well, the thing that drove me nuts, the most nuts about Obama was that crazy speech that he said, if you have a business that doesn't choose the highway, you didn't build up. Yeah. You didn't build that, build that business. You don't build that like that. That is, that is the craziest way to look at things. Yeah. If I was his friend, I would say, okay, this is not the way to say what he did. I think he started like highlight the victim mentality. Everybody's a victim. Whereas I like trump. He says, you're in control. Here's your opportunity. Make the most of it. I would see it very differently. I would have said, if you have a business and you start at yourself, congratulations. This is what American ingenuity is all about, but we all have to be aware, not just you not singing that person so you didn't build up.

Speaker 5:          02:14:03       Yeah. I would say we all have to be aware of that. Without our infrastructure, we would, none of us would be able to do that. So we all have to support this beautiful system that we have in an empowering way instead of, you didn't do it, you didn't build it. Yeah. Taking credit away from people who worked their ass off. And by the way, he's a guy who's never been in business, right? Just, he's a lawyer. He went from being a lawyer to being a professional politician to being the president. Yeah. Bam, Bam, Bam. I mean, this is, that's one thing I don't like is people who are like, their goal is to be a politician. Well, I don't like that. I'd like it if they were awesome at it, but no one that I like. It seems like the best. Like even back in, you know, that, you know, when our country was founded, it, those weren't politicians.

Speaker 5:          02:14:48       Those were guys who had influenced, who made good decisions and then they were politicians. You know what I mean? I've been watching vikings a lot lately. It's new. Show up and watch him gay. And, uh, it seems like there's no good leaders in the Viking world. There was bad leaders. This leader suck. Nobody wants, nobody wants a Goddamn leader. And when you're a leader of 350 million people or whatever the hell we have here, it's just impossible. It doesn't make any sense what's going on, Jamie? I just looked up that quote out of context, but he said it. He said those two sentences, but not in that way. Oh, if you've got a business they, and build up a fake news. Okay. So what is the actual quote? Wait, what's her? The real quote.

Speaker 5:          02:15:36       If you were successful, somebody lung, lung, Davies, some help, there was a great teacher, okay? But what does it, if you've got a business, you didn't build that. Okay? Somebody invested in roads and bridges. Okay, here it is. Somebody helped create this unbelievable American system that we have allowed you to throw that have, uh, that we have that allowed you to thrive. Somebody invested in the roads and bridges. If you've got a business, you didn't build that. That's just a shitty way to say it. I don't care. Even in context. Somebody else made that happen. Yeah. Not, not somebody else. We all chipped in. Did I know that's what he's saying. But it's a shit way to say it. It's a shit disempowering way to say it is. That's what I don't like. Takes credit away from the people that there's a way to do that. There's a way to phrase that that needs an edit and rewrite. And by the way, how the fuck could even have time to do that when you're writing. I mean,

Speaker 3:          02:16:30       you're writing under the pressure of being the president of the United States. I totally sympathize. I get it. I'm not saying I would have done better. I would have done way worse, but it still sucks. Yeah. It's just not a good way to say things. You're going to do that. I don't, you said you said disempowering and that's exactly right. And so, um, it feels like this is, there's a different tone right now. And I'm not saying, you know, our president is perfect. Just say white people. You like my people. I'm not saying that at all. I'm not saying that at all, but I'm just saying nobody's perfect. But I liked that part of the message. Well, he definitely has that part of the message, but he's obviously said a bunch of stupid shit too, but he's also a guy flies off the cuff. I mean this, we have to take into consideration what this guy was his entire career.

Speaker 3:          02:17:17       He's a giant larger than life personality with crazy hair, who puts his name on everything and then he ran for president. Of course he's going to stay that guy when he becomes president. We go down to know now that you're president, it's like when you, when you're in, if you're playing beauty and the beast and you're the beast, you've got to act like the beast. Now you've got the role and actually at the like, why are you still acting like hugh grant? Yeah. You know you can't, I know it's the role of being the president is this, you know, this majestic top of the mountain that we look at like, oh, he's the guy. He's the main dude where you're supposed to act like the president. Like, yeah, that's what they say. He's not presidential. He never has been. But you know what? He's been a leader, you know, so here's what I know.

Speaker 3:          02:18:04       I don't see anybody, I don't see isis over here bombing the shit out of the United States anymore cause they're almost, they're all dead. There's a lot. Well, there's a lot, but they were never bombing the shit out of the United States and trying to a few dummies that snuck over here and did some stupid shit here. Horrible Shit. Yeah. Look, the one thing that the military has said and friends of mine that are in the military and guys like Tim Kennedy that rejoined. Yeah, he said that they feel like for the first time in a long time, the military is basically got the handcuffs off and that they are allowed to do things the way they think would be best. Right. And a lot of people don't like to hear that. They like to say, well no, the politicians are supposed to control the military and it's supposed to be, you're not supposed to allow the generals to make the decisions.

Speaker 3:          02:18:54       There's a, there's a debate back we need, and this is again like a lot of other things because a very complex, nuanced conversation that you'd have to have all the facts at your disposal. I don't know either do it, but I can say they're not bombing the shit of the United States and sound like a complete redneck. Right. And that's how I see it. But I understand there is, I mean you need a stride a military because the world has some dark places and anybody who doesn't think that you need a strong military, you need to pay attention to what the fuck is going on in Syria, in North Korea, and a lot of parts of the world where they there chaos and this is a, an entirely real possibility anywhere, anywhere that exists, it can exist here. If you see horrible tyranny and destruction and chaos and other parts of the world, the only reason why it's not here is because of geography.

Speaker 3:          02:19:43       If they can get there, they can get here. If, if, if things can go sideways in Iran or Iraq or wherever the fuck it is, they can go sideways in America too. And if you don't think that we need military, your God damn crazy cause I would love it if we didn't. I would love it if we lived in this utopian world where everybody treats people the way you were. I would, well you don't have to worry about if you were in our neighbors, I would never worry about you invading me. You know I'd be like Oh cam is never going to like bring a gun over and fucking take over my house. He's a nice guy. If the world was like that, it would be wonderful. It would be wonderful. But right now it's not currently right like that and people that I know like Tim Kennedy, a guy who's been there, I was done that got like Jocko willink.

Speaker 3:          02:20:25       The guy has been there. Those are the guys that I turned to when I want, when I want to know like what's going on over there. I want to get a real perspective. You want to get a real perspective for someone who's been in active duty in a combat situation, who's been to these horrific parts of the world. Right. They can tell you what's going on and when they tell you that it's a better situation that the military has the handcuffs off. I listened to them. That's a good sign. Yeah. I, yeah. I talked to Tim at shot show and he, you know, I about going back in and he said that same thing. I mean, I don't know. It just, it feels like a, I dunno, it feels better that we're not having the terrorist issues over here anymore. Yeah. I mean, I really wish that everyone would come back home.

Speaker 3:          02:21:10       I really wished that no one was in Afghanistan. I really wished that we weren't the police people for the world. I really wished that we're not sending young people to die and in foreign wars that don't make any sense to you or I or anybody that really knows what the fuck is going on there. But this is the world we live in right now. Yeah. You know, energy it the best we can protect us, protect people here. Yeah. And hopefully protect people there too. You know, it's just now that's why you got to respect the people that are over there doing that and, and he does just like, you know, what a sacrifice, you know, and it's uh, I want to never take it for granted that there are, you know, we're safe here. Things are going on, but just what's the sacrifices made by people in the military?

Speaker 3:          02:21:54       It's a, I never want to forget it. Yeah. It is a very controversial subject with people because um, if you're on the left, you want less military, you want less war, you want less violence, you want less everything and that, that's a totally reasonable position. But I think in a lot of ways it's like wildlife, like you're talking about it as someone who's never experienced it. And I think once you experience it, and once you've been to these parts of the world, at least my perspective, based on the descriptions that I've gotten from people that have been there or that it's, it's way more complex. There are just parts of the world that are fucked. Yeah. Now, yeah, it's an, it's not black and white, that's for sure. And I think it's going to take many, many generations for those parts of the world to become a better place for people to live in and then sort of catch up to what we think of as civilization, the Western world.

Speaker 3:          02:22:49       And Yeah. You know, I mean, you're looking at parts of the Middle East where the women in Iran are risking their lives and their safety by not wearing a religious outfit. Yeah. There's all these protests where these women are on the streets were not wearing the hijab and they're walking around and they risk being imprisoned now. It's amazing. Fucking crazy. And these women are brave as hell, man. And they're out there just saying fuck this enough already. And they're taking pictures like that and they're, they're putting it up on social media and you know, there's a, a big revolt there right now where people are just tired of it. They want fucking freedom, you know, and they see what's going on in the rest of the world. They have the Internet, they didn't get a chance to see what's going on in America. And that's one of the things that we always have to remember about America. Yeah. America might be fucked in some ways and there's, we definitely have issues, but there is more opportunity and more possibility for you to do what you want to do here than almost anywhere on the planet earth as a fact. That's a fact. Yeah. That's a fact. And there's more art that comes out of here and there's more comedy that comes out of here. There's more, there's so much shit, more movies. There's, there's a lot of great shit that comes out of this one spot.

Speaker 4:          02:24:03       Yeah. It's a, it's a great place to, I mean we're, we're blessed to live here and have w we've only known this, you know, and I couldn't imagine living someplace where it wouldn't matter how smart or how hard of a worker you are or how, you know, whatever talented you were, you weren't getting out of there. And that's how it is in some places. And so, you know, in here it's not like that. And Man, I just, I just hope we never, I never need to forget that and I never want to forget that. And I just hope other people just realize that because it's not like I've been everywhere. But I just, I know that the, the challenge is like the women have that you were talking about. It's like, I couldn't imagine that. Yeah. Look,

Speaker 3:          02:24:46       one of the reasons why I'm Pro America is cause I'm pro human being. Yeah. And I think there's more, there's more chances for people to be who they really want to be and become what they really want to be here. You know? And I support a lot of left wing ideas, equality and freedom and gay marriage. I think he should be able to do whatever the fuck you want to do. I mean, go have fun, just be nice. Don't just do b, you just go be you. So when you know, people see me and they like spent like to see this giant American flag behind me and they think immediately, oh, right wing, oh, fucking conservative. All right. Or whatever. This is, what is this? What do you support? Imperialism, you support this? Like no, I support the idea of what America is. Yeah. That's what I support. Yeah. Yeah, me too. Fuck yeah. Woo.

Speaker 3:          02:25:41       So elk hunting September and we back same spot going to the desert rat. Is that, is that locked in? Hell yeah. That was crazy. Yeah. That's a beautiful place. Now. I know. That was one of the most fun times I've ever had. Yeah. Well we're getting it. We're going to do it again. I'm excited. Me Too. 470,000 views. That video was a lot of fun to make too, man. I just wish that they had put in, uh, the, the elk that you shot your elk, you did wind up shooting out a, an elk, but did, did the, the video that did not get the actual Arrow hitting the elk on camera. So what the issue was, it's tough. You know, bow hunting is hard, you know, in film and so it's, uh, you know, we do the best we can to tell the story. Um, I don't think it does tell the story very well.

Speaker 3:          02:26:31       No, but we do the best we can. It is hard, you know, I mean she'd be a lot longer. That's what I think. I think, um, I think that things should have been at least an hour and I think, um, even then it wouldn't have told the whole story because you look at it like, it's one of the things that uh, I've told a friend when we were watching uh, a hunting show before, they're like, wow, it looks so easy. They just go out there and they always shoot something. I'm like, man, to shoot one of these shows, like we were watching meat eater. First of all, meat eaters, one of the rare shows that they'll have a lot of shows where they don't, they're not successful. Like I've done two different shows with them. We were weren't successful. We just go out. There are seven days most hunting, most hunting.

Speaker 3:          02:27:08       Yeah. So when you boil all that down to 22 minutes with commercials, yeah. It just looks like it inevitably you're going to get to about 18 minutes in, someone's going to shoot something. Yay. They got it. It seems like you're shooting things that are definitely going to be there, but that's not, that's not the case. Now. There's no guarantee, especially with the ball, especially with the bow. I and I think, well, I mean we can film on ourselves. We can feel ourselves as long as we want. That's what I think we should do. I've been thinking about that a lot because I was frustrated by that whole thing and this archaic idea that everything has to be 10 minutes long. You're talking to a guy that does a three hour podcasts that talking for quite a while today and millions of people listen to this, so I just, I don't buy it.

Speaker 3:          02:27:49       I think it's an archaic, antiquated way of looking at things. I don't think it's right and I think this idea that people have an incredibly short attention span. Listen, people are consumers of entertainment and especially people who love hunting. I watch a lot of videos. I watch a lot of hunting videos. I'll watch a lot of videos on science. I launch a lot of shit. I watch hours and hours of stuff, things that I'm interested in. The people that are interested in elk hunting. They don't want to just see a couple of guys laughing and joking around and an Arrow hits a big bowl

Speaker 5:          02:28:21       and everybody's happy. No. They want to see like what, what? What happened? Like what was the struggle? There was a lot of struggle. There was a lot of damage. We did have to keep hammering. That was fun. That was, that was that one clip was hilarious. That was told, by the way, folks who listen to this or watching this, if you watch that clip of Cam and I, that was not rehearsed now. That just came out of nowhere. We were just fucking around. We will keep hammering. He's been around a little while, so he's been around a long time. They thought that was the origins of it. Did that. That was because that's how good we sold it. Yeah. That's how good we sold that thing. Yeah. Well that's your sense of humor and I think most people are not aware of that. This is what you say.

Speaker 5:          02:28:59       That's fair. You have a very funny dry sense of humor. You know? That was a, that was fun. Yeah, we had, it was a lot of fun. So let's come in. This time is Adam to green tree. You're going to come down a alert to Utah? Yes. Oh, I don't know. This is, listen, underarmour. His shit together. This is what we need. Remy, Warren, Adam Green Tree. John Dudley, Cam Haines, me, Ben O'brian. Make it happen. Salad. Wrap it up. Make a video. An hour long. How about just under armour? Let me film it. I just let me handle this because I don't know what the fuck you're doing. I think 10 minutes. I know. I think we can, uh, I just want to, man, I've always wanted to just share a hunting adventure. Just the real hunger adventure. Give it to constant content. Uh, the time to develop the story.

Speaker 5:          02:29:53       Just, just let it evolve. You know? Do you watch those hush and guys on a, on youtube now I have great videos. Are they good? Yeah. And they've got a lot of content in. One of the things that you really get out of their content is you really get a sense of how difficult it is. And mostly what they're doing is public land hunting. Well, born and raised. There's that stuff, that group of guys. Yeah, I'll watch that. I watched those guys too. Yeah. But one of the beautiful things about youtube is there's no time parameters. No. And people, yeah. I mean we are just kind of locked into this 22 minutes with the commercials type thing from the outdoor channel and it doesn't need to be, like I was talking with a brand and shockey about this back at [inaudible] and he's so talented as far as a film maker goes and, and uh, even in womack who put together our Utah, I mean without the handcuffs of a time restraint.

Speaker 5:          02:30:45       I just think there's, the sky's the limit. I agree too. I think the story should be what the story is and just say, just make it what it is. You don't, I don't give a fuck of it's 40 minutes or an hour and 40 minutes. People will watch it. People will watch it. Yeah. And the ones who don't, they weren't going to watch it anyway. The ones that, the idea that like you get it in 10 minutes and somehow or another it's more digestible in 10 minutes. Like stop. That's not real. This is a, people have these weird ideas in their head about things like, oh, but the statistics show that more people watch 10 minute videos. Well if you want him watch videos about babies chewing bubblegum or some stupid shit like that. Yeah, yeah, the 10 minutes. But you're supposed to be showing respect to what is one of the more difficult and misunderstood pursuits in the United States.

Speaker 5:          02:31:36       Right. And that's bow hunting, right? It's incredibly difficult and incredibly misunderstood. And I think it's a noble pursuit and I think it's also, it's one of the more intriguing things and more interesting things I've ever done in my life. Well, I know, and I don't know if you captured all in one film, but I just know that, you know, if somehow we could capture the, just the more of the journey because there's people that don't know anything about it. This one or know how to get started. I don't know if you'd have one film that I'd do all of that, but I just know that there's people hungry for knowledge out there that we're, we're reaching even with this podcast or with social media that haven't been in great. So it's like we're making these films to people who already hunters, right. I already know everything.

Speaker 5:          02:32:20       And so to them, oh we got to do this in a short period of time of those are gonna get bored because they've done this a million times themselves. Well does bullshit. No. That we need to, to make it for the masses. Exactly. Cause that's who we're reaching now. Yeah. I mean it's the millions and millions and millions. We're reaching more people than actually by hunting licenses. So we need to keep that, keep re need to remember that. Yeah. And the idea that you're even reaching hunters, that they're going to get bored after 10 minutes. That's crazy now. Yeah. Cause I'm like you, I watch all sorts of hunting stuff, especially you and me. We're in attaining is fuck let it roll. Yeah. Like the uh, what, what were we saying? Oh yeah, with the, with the um, chicken tied to the dog neck.

Speaker 5:          02:33:07       It was one of the funniest things cams ever said. He was talking about, uh, this guy, his dog was, my dogs killed a few chickens and I'm like, fuck, how'd you get your dog to stop killing chickens? He goes, oh, we tied a dead chicken to his neck and cam goes and she's tired. Dead stripper to your neck. And it was just out of the blue and I was fucking crying, laughing. But that, that was one of the funniest things you said. But there was one other one. What was the other one? We had a hard time remembering it. Remember the other one that you had said before? Yeah, it was even funnier than that. But my point is he's got fucking standup comedy timing. That sounds like something that, like one of my comic friends would've said, oh, okay, I wish I could remember the other one was another one that was funny.

Speaker 5:          02:33:50       Or I now fuck I now, God dammit, we laughed about it. The dead stripper tied your neck for a long, many times. Many times. It's also too, at the end of the day, kind of exhaust higher delirious dinner. Yeah. That's sort of, the timing comes in. Exactly. Well, it's like those hunting camps are so much fun. Like you at the end of the day, you and me and Ben sitting around laughing, cracking jokes, it's half fun of it. The family up there, the land family love those guys of the earth. No, Tom Land and his boys, they just, it's just, it's just fun to be, they feel like family when you go back up there. He'll feel, feel that this year, you know, he's a great guy. The whole staff they had there was fantastic. It says a, an awesome place and it's such a beautiful piece of land. You know, this is 240,000 acres.

Speaker 5:          02:34:43       Yeah. And that's, that's, you know, I know we're probably wrapping this up, but so when you talk about hunting and conservation real quick, you know, on that piece of property 240 they could make more money by running cattle on it, right? Do you realize that? But if they ran cattle on it, the habitat would be thrashed right there. The water sources, it'd be thrashed. All those flowers, the grouse that lived there gone because it's just cattle. But if his goal was making money, they could just do that. But the goal is, is to make money but also enhance the habitat and that's, you know, hunting is the best way to do that. Yeah. And it's, it's just a magical place. Like the mule deer that we saw wandering around his big mule deer and they have everything there, all sorts of different wildlife. It's this and it's gorgeous country to do. It is beautiful. Yeah. All right, let's wrap this bitch up. Cameron. Our Haynes on Instagram, and is that the same as twitter? But you don't even use twitter really right now on facebook. You use facebook at all anymore. Little bit. People die off that, right? Instagram's got, instagram's got it right now. All right. Um, and uh, next, next video. We make folks be about four hours long. No, you can't. The video, the hunting video. We're going to keep hammering. We're going to keep hammering. Bye everybody.

Speaker 7:          02:36:02       Okay.
