Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Hi Ron. I know. Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:00:07       I like to leave people in suspense. What's up fuckers? Hey, this episode of the Joe Rogan experience is brought to you by nature box. Do you hear that? Munchen in the background. That is the hilarious Hannibal Buress beating some naturebox and it is yummy is pretty. It's pretty good. I'm not even getting paid for this. Paid Burris sour cream and onion almost. Yeah, I get all the gluten free ones. Then I tried to get the healthiest version. They have healthy up to eh kind of sketchy, healthy but delicious. All delicious like pretzels. You can't really make pretzels healthy. Sorry folks. That's not really possible. It's made it a bread unless you come up with some rice pretzels. Anyway. Point is what they do have is delicious. The Blueberry Almond, so you've got to try that shit. That's my favorite. My second favorite is these dark cocoa almonds. God Damn, those are good.

Speaker 2:          00:00:57       Woo. Their products are all natural. They combine a much higher quality ingredient than a typical vending machine. Ingredients makes them healthier. They have a hundred snacks to choose from. So if you're looking for something that like if you have certain dietary needs, like your gluten free, low sugar content, stuff like that, they have that too whenever possible. They also tried to use non GMO food as well. You know, GMO food is a very hot topic. You want to say you're organic and GMO. No one knows what either one of those things mean, you know there's a lot of genetically modified food folks. Essentially all almost all corn you eat, almost all wheat you eat is genetically modified, especially wheat because it's like the 1950s they changed the shit. That's why people are so gluten intolerant. But g m o really genetically modified did like, you know, fucking lab.

Speaker 2:          00:01:43       That's the new shit. Yeah. You knew you were scared. You really no food. Joe Ran a little bit of food and a breast just a little bit. Anyway, no high fructose corn syrup. No partially hydrogenated oils, no trans fats, no artificial sweeteners, no artificial flavors, no artificial colors. So they make their shit. It's healthy as possible and still yummy. I think it's a good balance between, you know, eaten raw kale, which I do a lot of, and having these delicious cocoa almonds.

Speaker 2:          00:02:43       That's obviously someone else wrote that, not me. You can tell the difference. Slacking a certain something. Anyway, naturebox.com/rogan go there. Enjoy it. We're also brought to you by [inaudible] dot com that's o, n n I t, makers of Alpha, brain tech, new mood, all controversial, new tropics and performance enhancing drugs that are legal. Um, what, what is Alpha brain, if you've never heard of it before? Alpha brain is what's called a nootropic and Google, Google that word, and Oh, tropic. And what it is is essentially nutrients that give your brain the building blocks it needs to produce human neurotransmitter's. It's very complicated stuff obviously. Yeah, it was actually first formulated, I think Prasad, Tim was one of the first and it was in the 1960s they figured this out. They figured out that it changes or levels of Acetylcholine, acetylcholine enhances memory. For me, the big one, what it does best is allows me to pull up words like, I feel like it allows me to form sentences more freely.

Speaker 2:          00:03:46       And you know, there's actually been scientific studies done on it, both in individual ingredients and there's recently been a clinical trial on Alpha brain. All the, all the lab results are all posted@onnit.com uh, if you go to Alpha brain, the click on that link, you can, you can read the clinical results. We did one study, we got positive results, especially on a memory and a execution. I have to be able to be able to execute tasks and think about things. And it's sort of like what I'm saying with, with formulating sentences like this, there's a direct effect between how you can formulate sentences and how much nutrition you've had. I mean, it just makes sense. I mean, do you feel better when you have more nutrition? Of course you do. Have, you feel better. Probably your brain feels better too. That's the idea behind the Alpha brain.

Speaker 2:          00:04:28       Very controversial. So with all controversial ingredients, all the controversial, uh, supplements that we sell it on it, we have a 100% money back guarantee. You don't have to return the pills. The first 30 pills you buy first bottle, you have 90 days. Try it. If you say it sucks, you get your money back. It's that simple. And the idea being that we're only selling you some shit that we know works. There's scientific data behind it. I use it. Aubrey, who's my partner and CEO of on it, he uses it. A ton of athletes use it, including Bodie Miller, a j Hawk dudes who know their body very well. Supplements man, fuck gas branch and do you know what I'm doing, Hannibal Burress. I'm out there trying to, trying to spread everything that I learned. If I find interesting shit, I try to, I try to sell it the way to do it. That's it's like ethical economics anyway, on a.com. Use the Codeword Rogan save 10% off any and all supplements, uh, that does not apply to strength and conditioning equipment. Let's just all expensive for selling cannonballs and shipping them through the mail. So, uh, go there. Enjoy Hannibal Burress is here. Young Jamie Cuban music.

Speaker 3:          00:05:39       Hello.

Speaker 2:          00:05:40       Oh, you fucked up, son froze. Itunes froze. Don't be blaming iTunes, man. It's just fucking computer for the 1990s that I have.

Speaker 4:          00:05:50       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:05:51       The Joe Rogan experience. When people get silly, stupid shit that's on the list there.

Speaker 5:          00:05:59       Experience

Speaker 6:          00:06:01       Joe Rogan podcast. My Name, ladies and gentlemen, what the fuck

Speaker 5:          00:06:10       rest is here, ladies and gentlemen? What's up? I like a, I like meeting a Jude who I, I only know you by your comedy actually bought your comedy. I listened to it on the way home from Irvine and laughed my ass off and then meeting you and just within minutes we're talking on the air. I like that. That's the best way to do it. This is the best way to do it. Yeah. Thanks for having me. Hey, thanks for doing it man. I'm excited. Uh, that you have products and stuff. That's good to branch out, dude. It's all shit that I'm interested in. Let's try it again. I tried to keep myself interested. I think that the, I feel different when I get excited about something like a new exercise or a new hobby I'm trying or anything. I get excited when I'm in, so I try to spread that.

Speaker 5:          00:06:51       Yeah. As much as I can because I tried to think I want to get into other aspects of businesses and that's cool that you done stuff that, that you're interested in. Because I like comedy. I talk about this and Matt like light comedy, but I understand that is fleeting. So if everything in comedy with a way for you got supplements is shit. Yeah, but I don't think comedy is fleeting. He really thinks, I think it's like one of the least fleeting, whichever leading. But I'm just saying maintenance. It needs maiden but then cause a in the business like I'm talking about where you know, stuff might be going well, but then uh, you not work it as much anymore. I got a theory about that. I think that shits in the past. Yeah. I don't think that's going to happen anymore. I think guys would go away because they wouldn't get gigs anymore.

Speaker 5:          00:07:33       They wouldn't get television shows, they wouldn't get all these things. But now everybody promotes themselves. They all, everybody has a Twitter account. Everybody has a website. Everybody, when you get fans now they know where they can find you. Yeah. It used to be, if you weren't on television where, hey, where'd he go? Where's this guy? Where did he go? It vanished. You can't just go to his Facebook page and read a blog that he wrote today. That's fucking hilarious. You know, you can't go and watch a youtube clip that he made when he was fucking around his backyard with his dog. It's hilarious. All that shit is new. Oh, you know, I don't confident. I'm totally 100% confident. That's comforting. You're going anywhere. Hannibal Burress, but the top [inaudible].

Speaker 5:          00:08:11       You've inspired me to get my tiny bottles of lotion for hotels business going because that's what I'm passionate about. I'm passionate about tidy bottles of lotion and that seems like a stable business. People use it. I want to get in that. Yeah, people do use it. Someone's got to be selling them that shit. Yeah, that's a good point. I want to get into that. You have some better smelling stuff that a smell and stuff and maybe some jokes on the lotion. That's a good apple style with lotion. Oh Man. Too funny though. You don't want to do jerking off with your lotion and cracking up. No. Yeah, not that you don't want to be in the middle of it so you don't lose your stroke. You don't want to do loses his stroke when you go limp while jerking off. Man, those are tough. Again,

Speaker 7:          00:08:56       it up again while you jerking off what ss. A lot of work, but that's just if you focused, if you really, if you're really about making it to your goal, then you just power through. That's really what it is. It seems frivolous, but it's really just an exercise and achieving your goals. Fall down nine times. Get up nine times. Why did I say they say get up 10 what the fuck are you talking about? It's because people fall down and lock your brain damage. You can't just fall down nine times she got fucked up, man. Little kids fall down. They hurts themselves. But you're a grown man. You gotta Fall Down Nine Times. You're not gonna break something. Why are you falling? So what's that? What's your balance? Are you getting tackled or you just straight up falling? You've got a bum Nissan. No ankle week. You've got a weak foot. Yeah, people got to get it together. Fall down nine times. Get up 10 what are you saying? How does that even work? It does it. I don't know. I guess get up in the morning, getting up in the morning. That's what they count and count that because you get to count line down in bed then too. That's fallen down. Yeah, they gave a bitch. You went to sleep? Yeah man. So basically what I'm saying is fuck that old way, way commercial.

Speaker 7:          00:10:05       I've been, that's what I came here. So thank you. I'm glad you're here man. Promote naturebox and say fuck that stupid commercial. Yeah, congrats. The nature box. There's congrats to them. Cause this, this is pretty new company, right? Well is it? Yeah, I think so. Honestly don't know too much about him other than their stuff. Taste good. But yeah, I mean I know it's cheesy and you know, Oh, you'll philosophical quote shit. But this was an idea and is now is good. And his hair. Yeah. I like when anybody

Speaker 2:          00:10:33       comes up with anything. That's a good idea. It's interesting. It's interesting to see new companies sprout out because of the Internet to like this business is now, he could have never had it. Like today, if you ever want an excuse to start your own business, today's the fuck. Like here's this company vehement knives. They make homemade knives. They sent me, they made me a knife, beautiful handcrafted knife. Like they sent me a video of how they made it. Right then it's like, it's beautiful, handcrafted artisan ship. You know. I mean, I didn't really need a knife, but it's cool as fuck that somebody would do that and it's cool as fuck that. These guys who are listening to the podcast, their podcast listeners, they came up with an idea for company and they started doing it and now it's there. That's their job. That's their business.

Speaker 2:          00:11:14       They don't have to work for anybody. That was awesome. Making your own shit, making, making knives or whatever. Making old record players. Who knows the fuck you want to make. What you going to do with that knife that night? Just like so it's going to sit around my house and look cool. It's like a trophy wife. You never fucked, you know one of those just sit around. It looks sporty. No, I'll take it somewhere. Maybe take it hunting things go hard. We wrong. I might need it. Yeah. You know, you get attacked by something out in the wild. You gotta defend yourself. I have plans, I strategies in my head like what I would do from mountain. Mine jumped me. It was fucking me up. I have like an idea in my head or how I'd fight it with a knife.

Speaker 7:          00:11:52       Yeah, because where to hit it at? Where'd

Speaker 5:          00:11:54       you hit it with the knife first, which you get in the face and the gut. You've got to give the animal something to bite onto. That's very important. You've got to put something in front of the animal so that it bites that before applying to you. So bites the first thing. Get instinctively. That's when he stabbed in the neck. That's what I'm saying. That's a great strategy. I think that's the only strategy you gotta be willing to sacrifice one of your arms though. Your arms going to get mauled. Cause I couldn't, I'm pretty logical, but at times I'm a rational and delusional. So I think that I could knock out a mountain lion with a two hit cop, two hit Combo and I hit him with the right. Hit Him with the left and I'm stepping back to the young man confidence. Your punching power plant.

Speaker 5:          00:12:36       My feet house cat. I'm trying to knock out a house. A house cat can take a fucking tremendous punch. Really very rare. They go out. Well, I never punched a cat. What? I did watch a cat jump from a tree and it just stuck in a tree. I mean this fucking cat must have fallen like 30 feet, hit the ground, Bam. And started running. I mean it was unbelievable. I thought the cat was dead for sure. I was watching the cat started running and hit the ground. It's a video is a video of it on youtube. I saw it online. The cat hits the ground and fucking takes off at full clip. Doesn't go whoa, hold up. What the fuck just happened? Cat fell 30 feet, which is approximately like, what would that be for a person? I don't know. Six foot tall person falling 30 feet.

Speaker 5:          00:13:20       It'd be terrible compared to a cat. Cat is four inches high. Yeah. Fell that far and it was fine. That's crazy. Cause I can't even walk right away. If I had like a huge Fart, I still kinda got to, I can't. I got a little bit, yeah, get shaky. Shaky of, yeah. It's all good for that cat food. Just be it. I think they have really flexible bones. Don't think cats. Cats like they, uh, you know, they're built different than us. Yeah, they can. They can definitely take impacts. We can't, right. My point is I don't think the left right going to work. I don't think it would. You might have to get the, I clench the knees techniques. Yeah. Here's the cat. Watch his fucking cat is kept. Falls out of his fucking tree, man. You like that cat's dead. Right. Okay. First of all, I said 30 feet.

Speaker 5:          00:14:09       That shit's way higher than 30 feet. 80 feet. Look at that. Boom and then see ya. And the cat runs off the feet. The cat fell 80 feet. Okay. That's just a different thing. They're just way different than us. Look at that cat's fine. That cat is broken up, but is this shock? You might be right. I might be right. I mean, look at that shit though, man. Oof. Did it follow this? It's like a fell out. It's back. Yeah. That's a shitty cat. Cat is broken up. That's a shitty cat. I thought. Cat. So he's filling their fat cat. That cat had human like self consciousness where you know how we fuck that. I'm cool. I'm cool. That's what that cat was doing. That cat isn't that fine? I think you're probably right. And you notice it hit the and the way down.

Speaker 2:          00:14:52       I bet it got knocked the fuck out, but that's what happened. I bet it got dazed. He'd probably crack one of those branches and then maybe that that's what helped it survive. Maybe gain k owed by the branch. Like watch this man. Did it hit a branch? Yeah. I wonder what part hit the branch and then they ran under the car. Yeah. Okay. That's good bank. Yeah. Yeah. See it. Bam. Yeah, it definitely hit that tree. At least it looks like in that perspective. Poor cat. Anyway, he's fine amount of lines like that, but bigger. In fact, they say that like house cats and mountain lions are very similar in their amount of power. You know like what they can generate pound of body weight, which is pretty fucking crazy when you think that a mountain lion is out there running around like a 50 pound mountain line would fucking kill you easy then.

Speaker 2:          00:15:43       Yeah, that would be a bummer the way to do you go into woods and hunt and stuff like that? Yeah, I've been doing that recently. But when you go there in the woods hunting, you're armed. You're not worried nearly as much as if you're hiking. You go in California where you go? No, I have, well I've been pig hunting in California. Went wild pig hunting did once it have been a Wisconsin and Montana, the two places in Montana has been the only place I camped out outside. And do you have a hundred and crew? Was it other comics? So as you got, what would Brian Cowen, yeah, yeah. I went with him twice. We didn't go pig hunting together. I went out with another guy. I went with this, there's a guy named Steve Rinella and a, he's got this TV show called meat eater and he's a hunter.

Speaker 2:          00:16:25       He took us hunting and I got hooked on it. Really do. Fascinating Shit. Do you eat the stuff you hunted? Yeah, I try and I'm trying to only eat that. That's what I'm trying to depression. I'm process. Yeah. I mean it's, it's a hundred percent organic except footed lit. Yeah. You don't have to keep showing that pig that's a photo of the pig murdered it. He can't say murder cause it's not a person. I suppose to say harvest harvest makes it sound better. That's still like killing an animal. But you kill an animal every time you eat a ham sandwich. Harvest tomatoes. Yeah. Well they think of it as crops, not its crops, but as you know, something you're, you're getting out of the earth. You know, harvesting an animal from the earth, bringing it home and eating it. I'm trying to only eat that at home, you know, I just think there's a lot of bad Karma attached to factory farming.

Speaker 2:          00:17:13       I just think I'd like meat. I don't want to give up the idea of eating meat, but the eye and you watch those videos and people could say all they want about that's, you know, a fraction of those, you know, of those animals get treated like that. Most animals get treated ethically and humanely. I drive a friend who has a farm and he raises a grass fed beef. He raises these beef for slaughter. They have a full pasture, the grazing and they, you know, they're out there eating grass, no hormones, no antibiotics, no nothing. Those cats, those, they're scared as fuck. I'll give you go anywhere near those cows. Those cows freak out. You know why? Because they know we're killers and we're going to eat them eventually and they're trapped in this cage. Like the idea that it's way better, it's better. It's definitely better. Most of the time it's better, but it's still a freak out. They're still trapped.

Speaker 7:          00:18:02       Well, just a lot in life they took given they were given it a lot in life. That's a Saki lot in life. It is. But so you so use this though because hunting is just doing the same thing but on a, on a more base level, just on a smaller level

Speaker 2:          00:18:20       in a way. Yeah. You just doing it. I mean, you cutting out the middleman and you're cutting out, you're cutting out the middle man in the animals living completely wild. This is like a concept behind hunting that certain types of people do. It's called fair chase. Yeah. And what that means is that you're not dealing with an fenced in environment that you're only hunting and an animal that's truly wild, wild animal. They can go wherever it wants. So in order to harvest this animal, you have to figure out how to get close enough to it. You've got to stock it, you got a, you know, you got to understand where the wind's blowing. Like there's a lot of factors involved. And when you take that animal, most likely that an animal would not have even known you existed until it died, like out of nowhere. It just dies. Right. And it's the most ethical way. But that animal's still scared as fuck. If it sees a person and the reason being, because there's people like me that will shoot it. Right.

Speaker 7:          00:19:09       No, I see. That was and that bit, you know, just chilling out, waiting to and has seen it. It hasn't just seen his friends be slaughtered and hung up.

Speaker 2:          00:19:17       Yeah. It's not trapped. Yeah. You know, it's a wild animal. You're going out and getting a wild animal, but it's also a wild animal. That's most of the time they're aware of people and then they don't want to be anywhere near us. Yeah. The, the real tripper is when you can go and you could see a wild animal that probably never saw a fucking human being like go up to the Yukon or some shit. Yeah. And then they freak out. Or they, they don't even know what the fuck you are. A caribou. Caribou will just look at you like, what the fuck is this? Sometimes antelopes will come towards people because they don't know what the fuck they are. Yeah. They're like, what the fuck are you, I never seen when you were four and then point blank. Yeah. Well not that close. You just don't get that close, but they will look at you. But sometimes antelopes had been encountered people and sometimes Caribou. We encounter people and once I've encountered people they'd get way touch here. Yeah. Do you have a catch phrase when you hunt when you hit one? I sh I need one. Well yeah. Is that it? Blam blam we eat ham.

Speaker 2:          00:20:20       That's awesome. That's the perfect one for pig hunting. Pick one. I'm actually, uh, I'm in the process of brining a ham right now that I'm going to smoke. I bought a smarter means soak it in and it's soaked in salt and brown sugar and um, it's been soaking in this, this brine for like five days. Wow. And I'm going to, I'm going to smoke it tomorrow. Yeah. That's awesome man. This new thing I'm into, that's great dude. I eat almost exclusively delivery, so we lead opposite lives. Totally opposite labs. I love delivery. Don't get me wrong. Deliveries. Like one of the greatest things ever that you could sit in your house and someone could bring you a delicious food. Yeah.

Speaker 7:          00:21:05       But yeah, we're at the opposite spectrums of Eden. I am. Natalie is a middleman, but there's somebody, there's a lot of the steps with somebody bringing it to me, to your house, my house to the restaurant using an app to do what I'm using seamless web to do it and that's going to the restaurant. The restaurant's getting the food from somewhere. Then this making the food and bringing it to me through and you're actually going and shooting pigs in the face.

Speaker 2:          00:21:31       You don't want to shoot him in the face where you do, but you don't want to mess miss them. You know, if you could shoot him in the head, that'd be ideal. Yeah. The phases. The head. Yeah, you're right. What you mean side of the head? No, you really want to go for the heart and the lungs. You go for the body. That's how you, uh, that's how you usually stop them because you can miss the hat and graze their nose, blow their face off. That happens sometimes. Yeah. Like deer get their face blown off. Someone tries for a headshot and they mess and then the animal is still running around with half a face. Well, I was just trying to be funny.

Speaker 7:          00:22:03       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:22:05       Me Too. I just failed my part. Failed. Do you think you could ever do it? You ever thought about going hunting?

Speaker 7:          00:22:14       Oh, no, I don't. I'm not a patient person. I'm very, uh, I need stuff to happen right away. Right. So, yeah, I don't, I don't know. I actually, only time I've ever, I was in Mississippi when I was a kid. Uh, my aunt stayed in the country and missing like I sold the business. It was a small towns. It's very conscious. So they, they were wild hogs around and I was, I had a shotgun and I was able to, to shoot one shot off at a, at a pig that I missed. So that was my only, that's my only experience with a hunting. I fished once and caught a fish and now it was pretty cool. But yeah, I maybe I could do it. It will be a different experience just to be in that, just that type of life. And just knowing that, you know, it's people that do that a lot.

Speaker 7:          00:22:58       Just seeing that, that type of work. Like I, uh, for my pilot for comedy central, I worked on a goat farm actually where they milk the goats. Uh, they, you know, they, they sell goat milk and everything there. And uh, they got the Billy goats and then it was a, it was real. It was really different just being in that, in that, uh, in that environment where this is these people, this is what they do for a living. And they just live off goats state, you know? Yeah. They milked goats, they got goat cheese, they got goat lip balm and this crazy thing, you know. So that was, that was real cool. So I am interested in our world. I don't know if I could, I could probably visited your urbanized. Yeah, I'm urbanized to the core. I think maybe. Oh, you know, maybe we'll get, I would, you know, try some different stuff and, and do it for an extended amount of time.

Speaker 7:          00:23:48       But right now I'm pretty comfortable. Yeah, no, look, the cities are definitely awesome invention. Yeah. What a great idea to cut all that nonsense out. Yeah. But the thing, the thing I found about is that they're nonsense or the hunting and fishing too. They're fun. Yeah. They're fun on some weird visceral level. It's funny. Yeah. You fairly, yeah. It feels, it feels good to go through that where you kill the animal you do to mediate it and, and you, you make it. Yeah. You did it out. It has a feel. Yeah. Real fulfilling. And, and you know, that's, I mean, that's what we used to do as, as humans. So you think you'd be interested in going hunting on a TV show? Would you be interested in doing it? Probably.

Speaker 2:          00:24:31       Great idea for a show. I think that's the next show. I mean like Steve Rinella, this guy that, uh, from the host of media, and I've been trying to think of a show. I think the show is taking comedians hunting. I think that's, look, that's something that, it's a very controversial thing too.

Speaker 7:          00:24:48       I mean I don't find it con I think if you a immediately, you can't really find it if you're media controversy, but you saw about vegetarian

Speaker 2:          00:24:56       vegetarians have an issue with it but really dummies. It's very controversial with dummies, you know dummies love to knee jerk on that. Like, oh you want to shoot an animal? Is that what you want to do? You I had to kill animals. You a bad ass. Bad Ass. Why don't you need to use a knife? Like they'll say something. Why don't use your bare hands? Yeah. Cause you'd fucking lose.

Speaker 7:          00:25:15       Oh Bitch. What team are you on? Is People that Feifei it just did in that sense. You know, it's funny with Pete, like not a vegetarian debate, but my girlfriend is vegetarian but uh, and kosher. But each fish. Huh? But, and I try to say that's not true. Vegetarian eat salmon and then only certain types of fish though. Only child fully kosher fish. Kosher fish. Oh, she's crazy. You got to get away from her. No, she's, she's good. That's Voodoo. Oh sure. You food. It's food. I tried to say like that's old rules. It's so dumb. They update it.

Speaker 2:          00:25:53       Well you know they use that as like it's certain slaughterhouses, they have to have a rabbi come and they see use a knife and the slaughterhouse W W we filmed fear factor in a slaughter house. And that was the first time in my life that I, I recognized very clearly that places contain memories. They contain something, some feeling of some shit that went down there. Yeah. Cause the moment I walked into that slaughterhouse like the moment, like as you get closer to it for you park your car, you get out of your car and start walking towards the door. You feel heavy, you feel it. You could feel it. You feel weird shit in that place. She walking around. It might be psychological, but it might also be, that place is still buzzing with a million fucking slaughtered cows freak outs. Cause it feels like it. It feels like a where if

Speaker 5:          00:26:44       you came around that spot, if you were like in the old school game of Thrones days and you came over a hill and you might stop, why do it? Why does this place feel fucking shitty? What does going, what's what happened here? What Joe. Dot. Phil and Co also going a bit, man, I'm about to make strange as eat bugs. There was no eating bugs. It was a simple task. Then it's dunked her head, her blood and pull out cow hearts with their teeth. What you felt the vibe of that place mom? Probably full of Shit. I know I was high as fuck, so I might've just been tricking myself into thinking it. A lot of people get mad sometimes and when I say, you know, you feel good and it doesn't make any sense, it shit doesn't even make sense to me. Alright. Relax.

Speaker 5:          00:27:24       People get upset about pay news. It's easy to yeah, to kind of people. You got to take yourself out of yourself sometimes I remember like, Oh yeah, that's just the person was saying stuff like you also gotta be able to poke holes in your own theory. You have to like right there, like I'm telling you, I felt this weird, crazy thing, but the reality is I was highly, highly lit up on marijuana. I mean, I was lit up, used to shoot that show. How I would do every episode high as fuck so high. Sometimes I forget how to talk right? I can never, I mean the only way I could do it and enjoy it because it was so preposterous. After like eight or nine episodes, I was like wow, this is the most, and I was like, God damn it. This show is going to, it's going to stay on TV.

Speaker 5:          00:28:05       You know? On one hand I definitely wanted to stay on TV. So it was great. Great job. A lot of Nice people I worked with, the money was great, NBC was great, but on the other hand I'm like, oh my God, how can I keep doing this? I don't know if I can keep doing this. So it was like a a beautiful job but a job but a job that I could do high rises. Then it became fun once I could do it. Hi. Yes, funny cause I never smoked weed before. TV appearances, anything on TV, but people think I'm high on TV all the time. Well if you got tested you would be high. I think the, what you're talking about, it's like intoxicated or affected. There's two different things, you know what I'm saying? No, I'm always affected by, we'd always, they basically medicated by weed, but I'm not always high.

Speaker 5:          00:28:55       Right. But I'm affected you mean because you might have smelled a couple of days ago, something like that. Even a day ago, two days ago went out because it was a period where I really did, was smoke weed for a few years. And even then people say, are you high on stage? Are you high right now? You must be [inaudible] have a stoner style comedy in a lot of ways. Well, I, I mean it's, it's uh, it's, it sounds like a negative, but it's a positive. You're a thinking comedian. You, you're a really funny writer. Like you take like, like really hilarious, absurd turns in your comedy and it's fun to listen to. So like when you hear that you go, oh, this guy's high as fuck, he's coming up the shot because I get annoyed because I'm like, if you, if I was hiding, do you know how bad this will be if I was having what's up with all these lights? Who's that? What are

Speaker 7:          00:29:42       you looking at me? Why is he staring at me? Why is it going with the cameras staring at me

Speaker 5:          00:29:45       or you'd get used to it and be like everything else. The first time I ever got high on stage I it was like skiing downhill when you don't know how to stop. Yeah, it works. Yeah. I mean I made it to the bottom. I didn't crash. It was like one of my best sets ever, but I didn't do it again for like 10 years. I was terrified. I was terrified. I just got high with some friends and never quite sobered up. And then all my shit, I gotta go do comedy and I went on stage just accidentally. Hi. It was great, but I was terrified.

Speaker 7:          00:30:15       Done it slightly high recently. I can, but I can't be blitz. I can't be blazed if I'm blazed. Don't to blaze. I just got to leave. But this is a public place with a bunch of people. If I'm to blame. All right, see y'all later. I'm going home to my safe place. It's definitely

Speaker 5:          00:30:33       times when you can fuck up. You just get, I want his, uh, there was a, um, a professional jujitsu tournament that I went to and met. A friend of mine was competing in and we went to watch him and support him. And um, after the, the Jujitsu tournament who went backstage and, um, we were, uh, we were all on these pot edibles that this friend had given us and they were pills. And my friend said to only take one, don't take two. I listened to him. I took one. My friend Eddie took to Eddie Bravo, took two. And I was talking to this dude and I was just way too high to be talking to anybody. And the dude that I was talking to, it's just a straight killer and he's a weird killer. He's a guy who had a reputation when he got in a street fight and actually kill the guy with a triangle. They had to revive the guy. He held onto the triangle, the kind of an altercation on side of a highway and he got out. I think he, his friend fought the guy first and then he fought the guy. I don't know that.

Speaker 7:          00:31:33       Oh, there's one of those regular fight with a guy was a regular, why president was trying to square up like a regular person and any other friends or like

Speaker 5:          00:31:41       fight for living. Exactly. Yeah. I don't want to say the dude's name because he wound up actually going to jail for rape. Um, he, he raped some chick allegedly. I mean, I don't know what happened, but he got arrested for olives now. Alia fans. Well, I mean, I don't, I don't know what happened. I don't know that the guy, he actually had to like skip town. He, uh, he took off and then they caught him because he was doing Jujitsu, couldn't stop doing Jujitsu. He loved you Jitsu so much that he was, he went to a gym and he was strangling motherfuckers and the people couldn't believe how good he was. And there's a certain level where like when you get to like a brown belt level or black belt level, if it's something some guy can manhandle you, you like, Whoa, who is this guy?

Speaker 5:          00:32:25       Like this is, this is something crazy like w have you competed before? Like ha who are like, why are you so good? This guy was just that good. He was just strangling all these people. So the rose a bunch of suspicion. So they checked out his name and they're like, wow, that's a dude wanted for rate. So I'm there super high as fuck before the rape charge, super high as fuck talking to this guy. And I'm like, man, something is wrong with this motherfucker. I'm like picking up a vibration, a vibration in his soul. He's willing to go to dark places if you fuck with him, like this is the wrong dude to fuck with. And then a couple months later he's running from the police doing Jujitsu. And then as a gnome deplore. That's crazy. Late season. Love it so much. I can, I'll do it. It's like once you get really good at it, it becomes like a video game.

Speaker 5:          00:33:14       But like imagine if you could play a video game in real life where you actually get to do all the killing and the other guys really don't even have a good shot of killing you like the other. You go ahead and try. I tried to choke me, you know, that's how good this guy was. This guy was so, he was world class so he would just, he couldn't resist. He wanted to go there and just strangle a bunch of men. You know, I don't know what it was. I mean, somebody might have fucked with him when he was young and he never forgot it and he, you know, that's, that happens a lot of guys, they have like childhood abuse. Somebody kicks their ass when they're a kid and they just become this fucking savage because of that develop that defensive mechanism. You know, I enjoy fighting, but I, when I watch it like fight and comes off me enjoy watching it, I ends up watching it.

Speaker 5:          00:33:56       Yeah. Yeah. I enjoy watching fight and a in my mailbox, but just cause it's fascinating. Like Yo, these dudes attack each other for living. That's all they do is hard way to make it too. It was like, I'm going to put like, that's crazy. Know this is my dream, this is what I want to do. I want to fight people and I'm willing to take the chance that I might get knocked out in front of thousands of people and millions watching it. Oh. I don't often recommend people get high before sporting events, but if there's a sporting event, you should definitely get high at least once and do their live. It's a UFC. Yeah. Oh yeah. I might, my friends do it all the time. You know? Especially in places like California where it's legal, they're not really interested in breaking any laws. Right. Colorado where it's legal, Washington state where it's legal in Washington state.

Speaker 5:          00:34:44       Last time we went up there. You could smell weed all throughout the place. Really walked out. Stuck in the, in the state at Vancouver too. You go up to valley, you go. Why? We had this is a UFC in Vancouver. The whole place smells like weed. People just light up. They just keep it low. Light up right in the stands. Fuck it. Yeah, man. Just to, I mean, watching price probably is watching somebody get knocked out high. It would be crazy to me. Live choked out lives crazy, but it's also watching hub. Goddamn could they are, you know when you're super tuned in for people who don't get high, the idea behind it is like, well yeah, if there's something you should get drunk and go do, let's go get drunk and watched the super bowl. You know? That's stupid thing to say, but what I'm saying, get high and watch mixed martial arts.

Speaker 5:          00:35:24       You don't even have to watch UFC. Watched some kickboxing. When you watch think anything like high level athletics were two dudes have a lot at stake, which is what it is. You're so tuned in to what they're doing. You're so he, the whole thing, it's like electrifying. Right before I used to work for the UFC, I never, I never do the UFC high ever. But before I used to work for the UFC, I used to love to get barbecue and watched the fights. It was awesome. So the whole thing, it's such a such a wild experience, like primal experience, you know when your baked, he just

Speaker 7:          00:35:55       tune into it. Yes. Is to man, I couldn't imagine getting, just will have seen some of the highlights of fights where it's just crazy. Like a guy's getting his ass whooped and all of a sudden he's whooping up like, but getting destroyed. Like the guy got a couple of punches in like this dude is bloody, he was just getting destroyed. Like oh he's about to lose. And then all of a sudden he has this dude in a rear naked choke or something and the dude is tapping out like how did that happen? How was he able to take 15 punches to the face?

Speaker 5:          00:36:32       It happens all the time. You still win the fight. There's certain dudes if you could just take it. Yeah. That's one of the things that you learn when you watch him. My man. Yeah. All that. All men are created equal bullshit. Yeah. That's how dirty, stinky lie. That will fuck you over if you believe that all men are not created equal. No, not even a little bit. There's some dudes they can do shit. You can do that, right? You can't move like Anderson Silva period. Right. If you're some dude who thinks it all men are created equal and you get in there with Anderson Silva, that fucking guy moves like he moves like he's in another dimension. Most guys can't handle that. Okay, well I

Speaker 7:          00:37:11       that x's you exercise your body, your legs, back,

Speaker 5:          00:37:16       arms, right? ABS, chest. You could work that, but how do you make your face job? It's a lot of it's genetics. It's genetically. How could you just take funds is in the face? Well, I can't pass out. I can't. I mean I can, I can, you know, I've been hit in the face many times, but I know I don't like it and I know I'm not the best at it. I don't like it. Maybe there's a few people that do like it, but I don't like it. There's some dudes who forget fired up by, but there's some guys that take a shot way better. You know, I don't have an extraordinary ability to take a shot, but I don't have a, I don't have a weak chin either. Some guys it's really weird. Like, um, it could be past trauma. It could be that they've been hitting the head too many times, but some guys just can't take a shot at all.

Speaker 5:          00:37:57       They're just, it's weird. They just, they get hit like half decent and there they get wobbly. Whereas like some dude's like Pacific islanders, like Samoans. Yeah. God Damn. Those dudes are known for and be able to take a shot like David [inaudible]. You ever see David to a fight? No. He's a heavyweight boxer. Uh, fought like he had like crazy potential. He lost a Lennox Lewis when Lennox Lewis was on the top there, but David [inaudible] was crow Russian people. He knocked out John Ruiz pull up David to a versus John Ruiz. This was a, when they were both contenders before Ruiz won the and David

Speaker 2:          00:38:36       to a knocked him out one brown Nate David too. It was terrifying because he get hit like a train and his head was like fire hydrants sized and he could just bang you just take them in the face. There is, which is scary, right? Oh yeah. And you see their Olympic bronze medalist in 92 I mean he was a serious, serious athlete, so it wasn't just that he could take a great punch. He was also an elite boxer. I mean David [inaudible] in his prime, he's one of the guys that gets looked past like on any given night, David [inaudible] might've been able to beat everyone in the world. It just putting together those nights over and over and over again. Look at this. Boom, Ruiz is hurt. Look at this motherfucker. Come on son. How good was David [inaudible]? Terrifying.

Speaker 7:          00:39:23       That's, that's the mall. That's most embarrassing when you have a you as an outside of the ring. That's Worsten. He says sub more demoralizing about that. And your wife has their shit.

Speaker 2:          00:39:34       Yeah, dude, he got fucked up. Kids are crying. The world was deemed denied. David to a versus Mike Tyson. It's a denial, like the world lost something because those two never fought. You know, I mean God Damn David Tool was good. Lennox fought Tyson, but Tyson was already, you know, look at this, he's out cold. But Tyson was a already, you know, pass his prime and he had chemical problems and he was doing coke apparently.

Speaker 7:          00:40:02       So do you think when like say like David [inaudible] was probably heavily favor for that fight, right?

Speaker 2:          00:40:08       I don't know who was favorite cause John Ruisa stud man. John Ruiz is a, you know, he, he won the title. He beat some really high level guys like John John Ruiz, a real good boxer. Okay. But say a two just caught him.

Speaker 7:          00:40:21       But I just mean like say a fight like with too is it gets somebody to is highly favored. But this other guy has his team there. You know that everybody's hyped. Like you gotta get up. But do you think there's people in that say like, man, he's about to get his ass.

Speaker 2:          00:40:35       Of course you got to get rid of those people, man. I see people on your team that will say that to you, man. Don't fight that dude. You know what the fuck man. You can't say that shit. You do need to hear that though. You know, you do need to hear that. You Go, Oh want that. You need it.

Speaker 7:          00:40:51       I mean, but it also is a, it's a job to where like, well he probably a little whip my ass, but mortgages, dude,

Speaker 2:          00:40:57       this certain dudes like when d like here's a perfect example, when Vinny Pazienza fought Roy Jones jr he, someone should have pulled Vinea side and went and listened. Dude, don't fight this guy. Yeah. Like this is not the guy for you. Not right now. Did he beat the first round of something? He was the only guy I ever, Vinny Pazienza was to never score a single punch and around ever. Roy Jones hit him at will and he literally couldn't hit Roy Jones was when Roy Jones was in the matrix. It was dancing and [inaudible] Jones. Yeah. Jones went through like a series of of of years where everybody was

Speaker 5:          00:41:34       like, oh, he's got no, he's got no competition. You know, it's too bad. There's not another really good fighter. It's not, there's not a really good fighter. He says he's so fucking good that he makes everybody else look like they don't belong in there with him. Guys who in any other era were bad motherfuckers, right. Do this is Roy Jones when he was, he was the best ever, in my opinion. He was the most impressive fighter ever for a period of a few answers to his rap song. Yeah. Well, must've forgot this is when he, when he finished, patsy ends at the end of the fight. God Damn, he was good. Or is this the first round? This is the first round. This was when Roy Jones Jr was, he was literally perfect. He had reflexes that no one can fuck with completely unorthodox style. Very rarely used a jab use leaping left hooks as much as you used the jab and was just so fucking fast.

Speaker 5:          00:42:27       Man. He just couldn't catch up with that rhythm. His rhythm was so fast. It was just, it would fuck with guys because they'd get in there and you've got a certain expectation of how long it's gonna take. Four guy hits you. So like if you're here and he's here, maybe something could come here. Maybe what we'll throw at John's house, you'd be like, Oh shit, I can't get away from those. I don't even know when those are coming. Yeah. I saw a, I went to Mayweather Canelo ah, that was a masterful work. Yeah. And I asked her full, I never see Mayweather alive and I knew it was great obviously, but when you see him live, you see how fast he is. Like so much than Canelo's only 21 or, and may psalm 37 and he was way faster than him and just dodged everything that he anticipated.

Speaker 5:          00:43:17       Every movie. It was crazy to see how fast and just scale what he, what, you know what it also is. It's not just fast. He's really good. He's really good technically. And by that, what I mean is that for folks who just watch like a guy box, you're seeing a guy move around, you go, oh well this guy is trying to hit this guy and that guy was trying to avoid it. But there's a language going on. Just like when you're speaking in a conversation, just like with two people are speaking. Like if you and I were talking and we're having a good conversation, it's because I'm recognizing what you're saying and you're recognize what I'm saying and we're combining our thoughts together with laughing and having some fun. This is like a flow to it, but you could have a conversation with some other person who just gets real aggressive with you and Tim, you don't want to talk because you're intimidated or you start stuttering in your words because you know this, you think this guy's gonna bark at you or you're, you're worried that you're saying something wrong because they're being very judgmental towards you.

Speaker 5:          00:44:18       And so then the conversation takes on a completely different flow. Well, that's what fighting is. Fighting is like that. It's like there's like, there's like movements and there's movements to get you to react and then there's recognizing your movements and your patterns and playing off of them erupting those patterns. Just like when someone's argumentative and they interrupt you in mid conversation to refute the first couple things you said and it throws you off. You can't keep failing. You keep your try to finish your thought, but it's not the same thought as it was because they got blocked too. Right. That's like a guy gets hit, but he still tries to punch the gun. When the guys out of range knowing the guys had a range just to let them know it's really essentially the same thing. So what may, whether is in his, his mastery is like a masterful physical conversationalist. He knows how to control the action. That's, that's a weird thing. It's like, oh, there's a Voodoo to that when a guy's had his best, like a Roy Jones in his prime or a May, whether right now there's a Voodoo to the way they move. Right.

Speaker 7:          00:45:15       You think Mayweather. He'll, he won't, he won't get beat before he retires or you think

Speaker 5:          00:45:19       I worry about him beating himself. Yeah. I worry about him doing something crazy. Like you heard what happened with those guys that were working for him. Some jewelry went up missing. He had these guys allegedly, allegedly they got the shit beat out of him. But now it's all, it's all seems to go away. No charges have been filed, which is the right way to handle it. Just sorry. Apparently the guys weren't the people who stole the jewelry. But look what I'm hearing. You know, 18th hand stories. I don't know what the fuck really happened, but let's pretend nothing ever happened. It was a total misunderstanding. What I worry is it something like that would happen and then he would wind up going to jail again. You know? I mean, I just think the guy, if you're a boxing fan, I think he's one of the best ever. I think he's, it's like a, as far as like an athlete, I think Mayweather's like a national hero. Yeah. I mean not a national here like a national treasure. You know, it's like you should really pay attention to this cause this is very rare that a guy has this much better than everybody around him. Nobody could touch him. He's standing in front of a murderous puncher and Canelo Alvarez and Canelo's all frustrated and flustered and he's can't hit the dude.

Speaker 7:          00:46:26       That's funny. I always hit people say, hey, whether there's arrogant, Yay Erika. He punches people into Facebook living and he's never lost it and he's not punching regular people would if he's punching other people in the face. That also punch people in the face for yes, he's arrogant and he'd done it over and over and over for millions of dollars and that's all he does.

Speaker 5:          00:46:46       You can't be not arrogant and be that good. You can not display it. Yeah, you could do better at hiding it, but that's tough. But with him, the thing is about hiding. It wouldn't be necessarily beneficial financially. Yeah. If it's better to create that persona. If people want to see him lose 20 30% of the people that buy a main where the ticket or trying to see him lose, I will say more 50. It depends on who he's fighting. Yeah. Well yeah, that's true. But I mean like no matter who he's fighting

Speaker 7:          00:47:16       Mexican flags in that in uh, in the stadium when I was there.

Speaker 5:          00:47:20       That's true. But I think there's some people that pay to see him lose to anybody, whether it's Canelo Alvarez was Filipino menu, no matter what anybody, they just want

Speaker 2:          00:47:30       to see this motherfucker Lewis, Ricky Hatton there were so disappointed to the English people thought this is the guy fucking come over here at beat Floyd Mayweather couldn't even touch that dude. It hasn't, he had a downward spiral since. Hadn't, hadn't did. Yeah. He got knocked out by a pack gal really bad after Mayweather. Knocked him out. Mayweather knocked him out. But Mayweather, like he hit him with a left hook. He, but he out. It's just outboxed him master fleet and then caught him on the chin or wobbled him and then finished him off. But Manny Pacquiao slept him. He caught him after that fight. So it was too bad knockouts and then, you know, he took a lot of time off and started hitting the white.

Speaker 7:          00:48:09       Yeah. Ricky Hatton need to get in the supplements of business.

Speaker 2:          00:48:15       Well he came back, he got a, he had a coke problem for a while. It got crazy, you know, did a lot of partying, you know, got depressed and then got right back into it and got back in shape and had a fight and lost the fight. But a, I think he decided after that he just couldn't perform at the same level anymore and he was going to retire. But you've got to realize for him, if you're listening, Ricky, you can't expect you bought it. It bounce completely back with one fight after he did coke for five years. You know, I mean, I dunno what they told you coke does, but uh, you need to give yourself some recovery time. You know coke set in this, I know people did coke in the 70s they have like serious neural muscular problem. So Shit. Yeah, the people like a lot of old people that did a lot of coke like way back when they developed like all sorts of like weird nervous problems. Weird. We're weird issues with controlling their bodies. You know like there's a direct connection that a lot of people have with a, with Richard Pryor went through when he was older with all the coke that he did when he was younger.

Speaker 7:          00:49:16       Yeah. So don't do that much coke, coke and moderation. Everybody in light moderation if you have to, if that don't do it at all.

Speaker 2:          00:49:26       I also think it's real. It's a real problem with coke being illegals. You don't know what the fuck you're getting a coke mixed with some speed. Yeah.

Speaker 7:          00:49:36       Well you know the government can't get go that far in legalized coke.

Speaker 2:          00:49:41       Do you? Don't think so. Do you? What about decriminalizing it? Do you think that that's possible? That's possible.

Speaker 7:          00:49:46       I still make it. It's still a B. I think it will still have the same problems. Right?

Speaker 2:          00:49:52       But what did it mean? How much? How much worse? I've never done coke. How much worse is coke than alcohol? When you see someone who's really fucked up, drunk, violent, I've seen people that are due to become totally rapey when they get drunk, just grabbing girls outside of clubs can't bitch. I've seen people get crazy. Come on girl. What the fuck you too. Good for me.

Speaker 7:          00:50:12       It's a tough comparison just because of how people take them. You know what I mean? Like people, you might have eight shots of lick, but for the most part people, I mean there's some people definitely that's on the extreme side, but you're not going to keep on it and coke,

Speaker 5:          00:50:28       uh, that is a problem. Right? And so once you feed that monkey, you want to keep feeding it. Yeah. That's the difference, right? Cause you guys, you can also get kinda crazy apparently when you've been doing coke all night. Like you don't know what the fuck you're doing, you know,

Speaker 7:          00:50:41       energy and you just feel smarter than you are

Speaker 5:          00:50:47       how you are when you're drunk too. Right? You're drunk, you're half retarded, you think you're fine, but you don't slur as much coke. Right. But you talk more talk more. Yeah. That is one of the most brutal things ever. Talking to a drunk person when we Schober or talking to a coke head when you saw, which would you rather,

Speaker 7:          00:51:06       uh, however out the top pride sort of cocaine cause they probably at least have some ideas and shit and he, even if they had, even if the ideas aren't that great, I would be in my sober man so I'm be able to tweak it to my advantage.

Speaker 5:          00:51:22       Da. Yeah. Oh, okay.

Speaker 7:          00:51:24       Counter. And it's like actually kind of got the conversation a little bit.

Speaker 5:          00:51:30       Yeah. You know, Mike Young, do you know Mike Young comedian? I know that is, yeah. He had a great joke about a coke heads that they always want to start businesses with it.

Speaker 7:          00:51:39       Yeah,

Speaker 5:          00:51:42       true man. People will come up to you with like grand plans. Yeah.

Speaker 7:          00:51:47       Do, I mean I, uh, I have add, but I don't have an Adderall prescription, but I get it. Sometimes I get out of raw sometimes and when I take an Adderall at the beginning of the day, man, I just crushed life. Dude. I book, I book all my flights for the next month and a half. I'll get shit done, shit done. I write, I make lists, I handle stuff in my apartment and just, uh, just handle the stuff on Adderall. I'm legit add, I think.

Speaker 5:          00:52:13       Do you think that, um, okay, when when someone says I'm a legit add. Yeah. I believe you, and I'm not questioning you but isn't, you're talking about the effects of a stimulant though, right? I mean, when, when people do stimulants, that's what happens. Yeah. But I think, cause I don't get to the point where I'm like, Eh, like, cause some people take Adderall and they'll go, ah, there'll be really hype. Well for me you wouldn't be able to tell that I'm right, then I'm pumped up. You know what I mean? Like it, you have much more energy, but I have much more energy and just focus and I just handle stuff. Whereas I normally, you know, I'll get on the internet and just, I go, you know, on my computer with plants and just in a dicking around on Twitter, looking at, I'll get caught up in a youtube wormhole, you know what I mean? Wormhole, I get nose. Oh Man. It's a waste. Have you ever tried my [inaudible]? Do you know what that is or what that is? Is that your other supplement? No, no, no. That's a pharmaceutical. Yeah. Yeah. It's um, it's a smart drug. There's new vigil and Provigil Provigil was, uh, the original one I think in new visuals, the newer version. Anyway, I've only taught, tried new vaginal, but apparently this is, their effects are very similar. It's this weird drug, right?

Speaker 2:          00:53:26       And what it does is it just gives you energy, like when you're exhausted, like say if you, um, like last night I got decent amount of sleep, six hours. I have kids. So six hours are pretty good, you know, so I feel pretty good. But if you get three hours and you're like, fuck, I gotta do a bunch of Shit today, you can take one of these new deals. And it's not like coffee. It's not like that weird when I, when I'm like really tired but I drink coffee, I get that buzzy but dull thing like I'm kinda stupid but I'm moving around normal. This is not like that. This is like, it alleviates the sleepiness right on. It's all gone, all gone and now you have a energy and it's amazing.

Speaker 7:          00:54:05       Yeah. Yeah. Neat. Stuff like that. Cause I got, you know, stand up and working on show the press stuff. Energy neat. Especially for press site. If I had to do more than impress on the road, man, just to God, just to get through those interviews and just to be, be on point. I had to have something. What folks don't realize

Speaker 2:          00:54:24       and we, you know, you fucking wait, you gotta be there at like six in the morning and you work til like 10 o'clock at night on a most, you know, most nights. Even later. Yeah.

Speaker 7:          00:54:33       It's not even, it's just a thing. It's just to be on point. Isn't that an [inaudible] I try not to complain about just because it's part of is part of the job and I'd rather do it then work construction any day. But sometimes mentally it's tough to do a morning interview. But if I have, if I have, you know, take Adderall before then I'm snappy, I got jumped, I got anecdotes and then I can kind of, I know sometimes now I was learning how to, you got to take an interview over sometimes or want to not go on a rant but you have to not let them, you know, just cause they can get into that, cutting off your jokes and hey, a funny man handlebars just cutting you off. So just learning how to, how to do that and just having the energy and focus to be able to is, it's real helpful.

Speaker 7:          00:55:16       Yeah. The morning radio thing, if like they're good, it's great. It's real fun. It's pro is supported and set you up and, but then sometimes they just like, so what's funny in the world right now? Like inner bunny the other day, the guy who asked me that exact question, what's making you laugh right now? Ah, to Hannah, but what are you talking about on stage? Oh Man, I hate when they do. Yeah. Somebody asked me that before a show. I was doing it. And what are you going to talk about? Man? Just came up like what are we talking about today? Like you now, you

Speaker 2:          00:55:55       dudes that would go, well, here's my new piece. It's all about how man is constricted by a first his mom and his wife and a then ultimately his lawyer.

Speaker 7:          00:56:06       Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I guess the thing is just, I try to remember that people aren't coming from a shitty place normally. They just don't know how to communicate to me in a way that won't make me feel cynical and hate them. You know what I mean? So I gotta keep that in mind. But in the moment, like what the fuck are you just asking me? What's funny? In a world right now

Speaker 2:          00:56:27       for someone who's not a comic. They wouldn't understand how awkward that would be. Like what you like when you can go on a radio show and they just let you talk. Right. Just go hang out. Let's just hang out, hang out, talk about stuff back and forth from each other. Yeah. Yeah. It's not a lot of them. They can do that though. Cause that problem. Do you ever do those radio tours? We have to call like 10 different people and then you realize like eight of them have the same voice, like almost exactly.

Speaker 7:          00:56:53       What does this, the radio voice, I don't know what, when it was tested, when it was, it was, it was, it was a study that people, that people like to listen to. This right here, we live here in Nashville. We got Hannibal Buress in the studio. We alive here in Cincinnati. We got handled. There's a couple versions of that. This is a couple of versions of that was just, you know, and it was the sports guy as well. Gus Johnson here for showtime. There's the news guy. It's just the same as um, rappers though too. Like rappers, rap voice. You'd talk to a rapper, they might sound like me, but then when in their wrapped it like, you know what it is, it's a persona. It's just a persona that you know, works for that situation

Speaker 2:          00:57:34       though. I liked the, the Gus Johnson type voice. Like if a guy's, uh, like when I say that about Gus Johnson, I'm not putting them down. Like I like that professional. Here we are Madison Square Garden. I don't want a guy who's like, Hey, I'm like me. Like I, when I do the UFC there's a reason why I'm the color guy and I'm not the play by play guy. I don't do the big, here we are Joe FC one 52. Like those guys are important. I like that.

Speaker 7:          00:58:00       I mean it is [inaudible] tree. Its pageantry isn't a reason why Michael buffer works well. Yeah. That's even more so because he's a announcer said let's get ready to rumble this pageantry dog pageants. Yeah. I'm not putting it down but it is weird. Radio is weird and radio cause you don't have to talk like radio's different cause it's supposed to be your personality. You know what I mean? Like sports as a sports guy, the news is the news, but radios was to be your vibe. But then you sound like the dude in Saint Louis also.

Speaker 2:          00:58:31       You sound like the dude who's all over the place. Every guy you know another place where that exists. What was that? Strip club Djs. Uh, yeah, I've been trying to analyze this for many years and I think with Strip club Djs it's like no one wants to hear a dude talking while girls are dancing naked. You do not want to hear that guy. So he's got to make it like a song, like all ride coming to this stage. It's amber, remember everybody $40 comic cons. She's like, there's an entertainment aspect to that. What he's doing. It's like he's almost like he's singing a song.

Speaker 7:          00:59:03       What have you been to a black strip club in Atlanta though? No, CJ's no. Those djs out of most amazing Dj's. Focally f really because they drive the tipping, you know what I mean? They crack jokes. I relapsed when I was in. It's so funny like man, you need to pay the puzzle. They are bugs in here. Y'all ain't spending money. They'll drop the track. They'd come and cut the track by not spend some mother fucking money. Look what she's doing up there. She's up there like the Atlanta Dj's is strip club. Amazing. They probably just other black that black strip clubs like the DJ drives that Shit and is the driving force and as an entertainer in addition to add he adds to it.

Speaker 2:          00:59:50       See now I'm weighing the potential dangers of going to a black strip club in Atlanta with the entertainment aspect of how amazing. That must dangerous man. Isn't that that guy like me?

Speaker 7:          01:00:01       No there's no, I'm sure. I'm sure I need to go if I go with you. If I go with you I could slide right in. I'm not even that blood. Then I play. Yeah the black in a black strip club. The djs, the right and there famous ones is fate. I don't know the names though. Cause I have a bit, but you go to somewhere a magic city or magic city, a few other ones in Atlanta. Uh, the Dj is, is, is important and makes the strippers more money and the Strip was probably end up tipping out the DJ. Right?

Speaker 2:          01:00:38       I'm sure. Yeah. They have like an arrangement, right? Yeah. My friend Eddie used to work at a strip club. I used to go and visit him at work, watch it. Who's Dj? So I got to, I got to see the craft. I got to see how everybody does it. It's interesting the relationship they all have, it becomes just like, I mean you might as well be working in a restaurant. Everybody develops the same sort of widespread. Exactly. People get naked and that's, it's weird cause it's porn. Porn is like that too. Like those people get used to each other and it becomes just like any other normal. So you later good Jason on you

Speaker 7:          01:01:10       see? So I think it's probably funny when it's just somebody who you fucked like two years ago. Oh good to see you again.

Speaker 2:          01:01:19       They, I think they have definitely a more relaxed attitude about it. Yeah. You know, if you run into somebody that used to fuck out of nowhere, you're like, hey, look at me. I see you naked. All right. You take care of. Don't mind that Mo. It's weird when you haven't seen someone at 20 years and then you get to see like, whoa, this is weird. This is weird. Hello, Nina Hartley. I met her. She's very nice lady. She was doing Kevin Pereira as podcast. Yeah. I sat there and talked to her for awhile. She does everything with gloves on, man. Good. Yeah. She has like sex sessions with people. She puts like surgical gloves alone.

Speaker 7:          01:01:58       Yes, he does corporates. Right. Does she? I think a lot of them, yeah. A lot of them to do like corporate gigs. Corporates in quotes, quotes, I guess. Sort of. Yeah. And the way that corporates, private privates. Yes. She does a lot of privates.

Speaker 2:          01:02:20       Yeah. Like, you know. Yeah. Very few comics do privates. What would you do if someone said, hey man, uh, Burress I want you to come over and just do comedy. Just for me. I'm just a big comedy fan, but I don't like going to comedy clubs because it's fucking, I don't like laughing around other people. So could you just do your act for me and I'll pay you what you get paid for like a regular show for a packed house

Speaker 7:          01:02:42       for a no, they add the charge to my, my corporate college rate. Okay. And I would, I wouldn't want to do that. Can I bring somebody with me?

Speaker 2:          01:02:53       Well now you're worried about your safety. Don't worry. The guy's only going to masturbate.

Speaker 6:          01:02:57       He promised nothing really crazy. He just wants to watch you just he's going to keep his pants. Well keep a towel on.

Speaker 7:          01:03:04       Nah, I'm not doing that good cause I don't need the money that bad cause I got my own supplements

Speaker 6:          01:03:08       business

Speaker 7:          01:03:11       so I'm that, you know, I could do stuff as I want to do it, you know.

Speaker 2:          01:03:14       All right. How about if the dude wears like a space suit? The space suit? Yeah, there with a space.

Speaker 6:          01:03:19       How long ago was that fucking full set. Full outline set one dude. But one dude, can I bring an opener toe to warm up? He's going to watch your past specials so I can't even, I can't even drop him nets. I got to do a hour new. Well it feels a fan man. You he'd already paid due to do a one on one show. It does bits. You already know that was a shift from your last Shaw crowd work. So this is crazy. Look at this place. 50 gs. That's my rate for that weird ass shit. They're thinking about it. Some fucking tech guy who's was super rich. I'm going to get animal breasts. You just to stand up. Well it will be less weird if it was him and his buddy. That would be way less weird. Two dudes would be. Isn't it an interesting like inch instantly becomes less gay?

Speaker 7:          01:04:26       Yeah. Cause it's just also laugh at being at a comedy show with some is about like looking over at the person that, you know what I mean? Like doing the elbow. So just doing stand up for one person. It is weird as hell.

Speaker 2:          01:04:39       Did you find it's weird even to watch it on television?

Speaker 7:          01:04:42       It, it, well it's a little, the vibe is so much different, so much different. It's just a different energy and just, it is, it is isn't not weird, but it is where I've had people that say they saw my stuff online or they saw stuff on TV, but then they saw me live and he was like, Oh shit live. It was crazy. So it is just, it's hard to translate the true energy that's in the room and just that, that type of thing.

Speaker 2:          01:05:07       Yeah. They don't want tune into you when they're watching a video. They're just getting the words and the performance. They're laughing, but they're not too in India, if there's some dudes like you'll see them on stage. Like Brian Cowan is a perfect example. Yeah. Brian Cowen, like if you watch them in a video, he's hilarious. But if you watch him live that dude like tune you tune into them, it's infinitely better.

Speaker 7:          01:05:26       Well. Yeah cause the bits also, you know, you might see a a minute set out of somebody's hours, say online, but then in the, if somebody our club say out a theater set, you didn't get to see how they enter in, how they command at the room at the beginning and how, what they did at the beginning to allow them to be able to go to a weird place later where the audience already has that trust. So it's a, it's a lot of different elements to live standup that get lost in the Internet and TV.

Speaker 2:          01:05:55       That's a great point. The, the, the building up like, you know, like I've ever had friends that were just starting out and they'll do something like they have a bit and they'll do this bit like right away. And I'm like, you know what man, the audience should probably get to know you better before you do that bit there. Let them gain your trust first and then do that bit because the opening part of it, like you're immediately, you have to know you're a good person for that to be funny. You got to know. You're kidding. Right. Otherwise it's just gross.

Speaker 7:          01:06:22       Yeah. Like I got a joke about how, uh, the movie I spit on your grave. Have you seen that? Yeah. It's a weird movie and I do a bit about it, but I would never open with that. That's is coming at least 25, 30 minutes. Then it's a touchy subject

Speaker 2:          01:06:39       in that weird. They have to have trust in you.

Speaker 7:          01:06:41       Yeah. They have to ask for us and like you can't, yeah. You have to establish your funny for a little bit.

Speaker 2:          01:06:46       Yeah. And that's really hard, especially when you're starting out. Yeah. People don't know you, you know, once they come to Hannibal Presto, they know who you are. They're, they're here to see you. But if you, if you start now, man, if you're just a first, you know, first year guy like, man, you got to really get these people's attention. Like you've got to figure out a way to get them to trust you because they're going to make a judgment call on you within a couple of minutes.

Speaker 7:          01:07:10       It's less. Yeah. They'll judge you. The outfit, a black crowd. Why you walking up like Ah, it shoes. So you already lost half the audience. [inaudible] it looks kind of weird. Fin that's, you already got up work hard.

Speaker 2:          01:07:25       Yeah. Damn, that's hilarious. Why are black clubs so much more judgmental?

Speaker 7:          01:07:33       It's just a, I mean there's just a level of performance and just, you know,

Speaker 2:          01:07:37       demand more man

Speaker 7:          01:07:39       boy and just, you know, that the best black comics, it's just been great performance. You know what I mean? So you talk about, yeah, just a Red Fox and Richard Pryor and Bernie like these as well. Not only, you know, great joke writers and stuff, but they performed and they would crush. And so it's just a higher standard for performance also in, uh, black clubs or black, uh, showcase nights. The host is usually the star of the show a lot of the time. You know what I mean? Where on the road in an Improv, a funny bone, they will see as local. Sometimes he's good, but for the most part that, uh, the host is not going to be that great, which is not cool because that's who's setting the tone for the show. And just that you, the first person in the audience seeing, you know, donate, they got babysitters and od at and they, the, the host, the first person on stage is eh, where's the host at? A black line is the, usually has a local following is great, crushes does 20th, 30 up top sometimes. And so it's just a different thing. So then the next act has to be able to follow this amazing host with a great file. It, so it ends up with a lot of co comedians been a lot of black comedians being real strong performance, uh, early on.

Speaker 2:          01:08:53       I think that's interesting because, you know, Chris Rock said that about his career that like one time he had a go on after Martin Lawrence. Yeah. And then he, he really was a turning point in his career because he realized that he had performed to too many white crowds. Yeah. And he was like white crowds made him lazy. Like he didn't even realize he had gotten into this sort of like lower energy sort of mode of performing.

Speaker 7:          01:09:15       Yeah. Yeah. I was uh, I mean I wouldn't say it was black. Crowes it gave me a ship. I will, I'm a little bit higher ed is he now than I was in my first a CD but is that's just from um, play in, Oh shit. That's just some playing bigger venues and learning. Joseph spilled coffee on my fucking computer. A copy of this gives us unbelievable man. I've done this like four times in the last month. Shit man. You know what it is, man. I keep this Coffee Cup right here and I talk with my fucking hands because I have peasant roots. Huh? Is that, is that what that means? It's okay. The computer is going to be fine. Okay, cool. Just a minor AppleCare which, but it was no one don't be like pitch. This is the third time he came here. He gets the fuck out of here. Stupid as a 24 hour apple store in Manhattan. That's gotta be interesting. Yeah, it's very interesting cause I needed to get a new iPhone, uh, last week and I went in there faded and the worst president in the world is a drunk with a customer service issue. I was the worst to how drunk were you? I was drunk enough to, or I'm worried that they'll hack into my shit.

Speaker 7:          01:10:29       Oh, that's hilarious. It was pretty, I feel bad about it. I was just like, cause the dude, they weren't helpful. I have missed my appointment. I had a 1230 appointment, I popped in at two. It gave me a new phone.

Speaker 8:          01:10:42       Okay.

Speaker 7:          01:10:42       How's the worst? His name was, hey Suze. And I was like, come on, Jesus. And we were going back and forth. He wasn't, he wasn't great to me, but he also wasn't, I was being a dick to, you know what I mean? So, and also I was drunk. I felt bad about it. I felt bad about it the next day. God dammit, I'm an apple store via drug. They must get drunk people all the time at apple stores? Probably, I mean, yeah. Now 24 hour apple, our apple store, they used to outside. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:11:10       If you getting your iPhone fixed at four o'clock in the morning, you gotta be fucked up. Yeah. Cause you get an

Speaker 5:          01:11:14       activated iPhone and four o'clock in the morning. Can they activate it? Iphone at four o'clock could I want to do that?

Speaker 7:          01:11:21       Uh, yeah, it's a 24 hour uh, apple store. Cause I had to get a new laptop last week. So at 25 apple store, 24 hour best bus. So I did my shopping late, went and got a computer, went to best buy grout, Xbox one late at night.

Speaker 5:          01:11:37       Great Shot. Yeah. Yeah, I heard about the best part. It's 24 our best box. That's like near college, right?

Speaker 7:          01:11:42       It's a [inaudible] not too far from Nyu. Yeah. So it's a union square.

Speaker 5:          01:11:47       That's the one thing that Manhattan has. It's this 24 hour thing almost. You know what they don't have any more though is pool halls. He used to have a 24 hour pool. I don't think they have that anymore. Having gone these to have this place, Chelsea billiards. It was, there was a quite a few places, but Chelsea was the big one that was open 24 hours a day. Yeah, go there at four o'clock in the morning and you have a big pool guy. Yeah. I love pool a little about what you think about trick shot. Full stupid. Really? It's pointless. Yeah. I like tricks up. Pool is like tying a duck to a stick and shooting it out of the sky. Yeah, that's what it's like. The difference between a, you get to choose your shots. That's ridiculous. The whole idea pool is figuring out the patterns and moving the ball around, controlling the cue ball, making shots and and running out.

Speaker 5:          01:12:31       Do the table presents you with a problem, right? You have to figure out that problem and get out. This is some stupid thing that you practice over and over again, so I have to do is just poke at the stick and the ball's going in the right direction because you set them up. That's dumb. Oh, I guess it's good entertainment. TV, you know what it is. You know what? And I understand your thought process behind it, but yeah, but you know, I don't, I don't get to see them practice. Yeah. You see the shot. I just seen him do it. Let's go. It does look cool. Don't get me wrong. I seen trick shots. It looked cool, but I don't, I've been playing pool for 20 years. I don't know how to do one. I can't do one trick shot. Like I played pretty decent, but I can't, I don't know any of them.

Speaker 5:          01:13:11       I have no desire to learn him either. They just don't make any sense to me. It's like, who cares? You said, you know what people do that. Like say if a PR professional came to your pool hall, it was doing a demonstration. People like to see trick shots. Yeah. Like it'd be higher. I got like Earl Strickland. Earl Strickland comes to your pool hall. He's gonna, you know, he'll do some trick shots for you. I would act as you, I'll of course, you know, I'm like, you know, pool celebrities too. We'll get names. Yeah. Yeah. I get into shit, man. Yeah. When I'm, when I'm in the shit, I get into it. Yeah, you got, you should get pool kills man. I guess that'd be cool. No, I mean young business Joe Blow Joe Rogan Cuckoos Nah, Nah, that's that. Probably no pool cues. You'll only want to buy from a dude who actually makes the pool cue.

Speaker 5:          01:13:54       There's a thing about pool cue artisans. They make pool cues and like when you buy him from a guy who was like a, like a Zen Bodi or a task Arella like take, we'll have these names. Like they make these exotic pool cues out of wood and their craftsmanship and they cut them place in precisely. And it's a big like art form to it. Ah, so you wouldn't want to buy my fucking book. I don't know what the fuck I'm doing. Can't buy a pool cue with my name on it, but stupid. You didn't, you'd be an idiot. You want to buy a southwest, you know you want to buy a Jean to, you want to buy cues that have a name to him. Okay, cool. This is like a longstanding art form of, it's almost like a Samurai sword type of thing where there's like certain artists that are preferred over other artists. Certain the artisans that have a like a long history passed down from father to son. It's very common. Wow. Yeah.

Speaker 7:          01:14:45       I actually, I mean I'd be pissed. Why if like, man, I don't want to be in a pool. Cubin I'm passing on this pool cubit. I don't even like pull that.

Speaker 5:          01:14:58       Well, if you did like pool then it would be good, but if they want it to be a comedian, I could see your point. Yeah. Long hours in the shop. Breathing in fucking saw dust and glue fumes and shit. Yeah. Working in a paint booth. One of those gas masks on. Yeah, that would be, it's not for Hannibal Burress. Snapvault isn't. That for me is not for a lot of people. It might not be fun at those father son team. They might not like that shit. Maybe I would have to talk to them and just work individually. I hope I don't get angry white from the Southwest Pool Cup. I'm sure you would. I'm sure there'll be pest. Yeah. Yeah. There's uh, quite a few people that take that very seriously. Yeah. Well are you into anything? Do you play any games or anything? Do you do anything on the road? Do you bowl? I've got a marble collection.

Speaker 7:          01:15:43       I don't have a marble collection. I played video games a little bit. I'm a, but I'm trying to think of my other stuff that I do. I'm a pretty pretty bar in dope man. I'd play video games, do comedy, go to concerts. And that's pretty much it. Yeah. Keep track of my frequent flyer miles. Very, uh, heavily

Speaker 5:          01:16:05       no. How boring stuff. How hardcore do you get with the video games? Do you actually bring console with you on the road? Are you one of those dudes? No, I can't do that. There's a lot of dudes and get crazy with that.

Speaker 7:          01:16:14       Yeah. Cause it's not because it makes it more, it makes it more exciting for when I get back home. Cause that Kinda is how I, you know, I'm really at home if I'm sitting at home playing video games, if I've been gone for 10 days, like all right relax, I'm home, play a game. So that's, that's the thing. I, I leave the game at home. It's a good move. But I get into it. I only played two games. Gta and NBA Two k 14. That's it. That's pretty much it. Cause I'm always gone so I don't have time to you switching

Speaker 5:          01:16:46       games. Yeah. I want to get some skills, learn the game and then enjoy it.

Speaker 7:          01:16:51       Shoes is learning a new game. I might try out this titan fall. I got that, uh, for the Xbox while I haven't played it yet.

Speaker 5:          01:16:57       I keep hearing incredible things. Yeah. People have like emailed me if you thinking about getting back into video games, this is the video game to get back into with. I'm like, get the fuck away from me.

Speaker 7:          01:17:05       Yeah. And that's the thing. So you don't have time to play, but you got, so you got a lot of work and I was thinking about that too when I'm playing because I can't play for three or four hours straight limit. I should I be playing this or should I be writing a script? Should I really be playing against this 13 year old like talking shit to him? I don't talk shit. I might send that. I might if they talk cause I don't, I can't have a strain. I can't, I don't put on the headset when it's a strain that can just have a stranger having that much access to my brain like that. I already already do that with Twitter. I can't have their voice.

Speaker 5:          01:17:36       Right. Yeah. Could you imagine if that's the new Twitter, if people just to be able to anonymously talk shit to you right to nowhere. Yeah. Just like a, you can get your APP mentions on Twitter. If you could just get like one after the other, a bunch of people talking shit in your hair, your glasses. We'll smudge. Don't TV. Good. She looks stupid.

Speaker 7:          01:17:55       Well, cost of sneakers are those. Where'd you get that jacket? That was suck, man. I delete. You know what, I delete my Twitter app sometimes just cause I, I spend too much time on it. D really? But then I ended up putting it back on like two days later. But I do, but the Times that I'm trying to have like, and I'm going to try to two hours a day. Why? Just unplugged to awake hours a day while unplugged. Like no computer, no phone. So I either rewrite or workout or just talk or just chill. But no looking at the phone, no email, no texting, none of that. So that's what I'm trying to do. Just because I found when my phone was broken, I had, I didn't have my phone for a day. It just, it was broken. I've found that I was, I was a little bit more productive. I read, I read a little bit of a book, I wrote like six jokes or sobbing and I was, I felt uh, uh, way more clearheaded because I wasn't just checking peoples. You weren't tethered. I wasn't tethered. I wasn't checking Twitter obsessively and compulsively and yeah. So that that's what, that's why new shit.

Speaker 5:          01:19:01       Yeah. I get tethered to that fucking phone man. It's weird. It's tough. It's weird when you're out and you just have this desire to check your email for no reason. What the fuck like, like it's nothing that important in the email. Cause if it was it'd be a phone call. Yeah. Especially when you know you're not in the middle of doing anything. It's not like you're like a deal's about to go down. Alright Hannibal, stay near the phone. We're going to call on. You said that

Speaker 7:          01:19:24       even if it was going down, isn't that going away? Is that going away and a dealer's going to go down but you didn't get back to us

Speaker 5:          01:19:32       back to us in 20 minutes. We thought you one of the most hilarious guys of all time in a future superstar. But time is as the essence time is of the essence. We just called some other dude that we had on our list of guys whose day to make and he checks his phone all the time. It does get like that though when it's casting, when they get casting, when it gets down to casting calls, whether or not you agree to take a show, like they give you a offer and as a counter offer they have offers on someone else and then you know, it was like a backup offer. Well, if animal gets crazy with the money, we've got this dude wait in the windows there is that. They'd dealt that'll, that'll

Speaker 2:          01:20:08       definitely keeping near your phone. Yeah, but that's another beautiful thing about the internet. It's like that shit we were talking about like he used to need a show like guys used to go away. If they didn't have a shelf, they didn't have something to put them out there to the crowd. That's all gone away. Now you get your own show. If you want to do, you're great at podcasting. You could just start a fucking podcast. I thought about starting a podcast. Totally. Should do a podcast. You would have a hilarious podcast, but you had a podcast. I would for sure download that shit. I subscribe to it 100%

Speaker 7:          01:20:40       I actually recorded six episodes of a podcast. It was called talking to strangers and I just talked to legit people that the people that had never met before or that they weren't in comedy at all. That's a great idea. But then now, I mean that would be me driving the listenership every time. Yeah. Which is, you know,

Speaker 2:          01:21:01       but still bill bird does a podcast where he just talks by himself. Just him. Renton. So does Greg Proops. Greg does it alive. One, he does a show called the smartest man in the world. Yeah. It's hilarious. Just him and he doesn't ask questions and he does a lot of questions that mother fucker could like no one. Yeah, Greg Proops can, he can just go and he's smart as fuck. So he has like hours of information and has had the dude has so much information in his head. Like he went on a rant about Columbus. Like, I've read a bunch of shit about Columbus. I knew quite a bit about Columbus, but Greg Proops went on this mad rant explaining what a cunt Columbus really was fucking evil. You know those people were back then.

Speaker 7:          01:21:42       Yeah, you can be evil back then because there was no Twitter. There can be evil and unchecked. Facebook, no Facebook, nobody like evil Emma Evil Shit. Nah Shit. Chill out.

Speaker 2:          01:22:00       Go on business holding a baby in one hand, a sword.

Speaker 7:          01:22:04       You can just be evil because you just had you an evil and you add to four friends who also evil enablers of life being evil.

Speaker 2:          01:22:12       Isn't that funny that that is the case, the, especially when you get to a new land, like you getting a wooden boat and he traveled to this half of the world where it's going right in your eyes. Completely wild, right. You know, and they can come up with all sorts of justifications, why they should just start murdering people and then they find out these people have gold. Oh Shit. Yeah. How's it been so easy to be evil back then? You're actually right. Yeah. Twitter keeps people from being as evil.

Speaker 7:          01:22:39       Well in Italian and attainers will common called Columbus and entertainer. But that's what I'm saying. It wouldn't, I mean, I don't know if he would have been effective at whatever it is something funny to think about, but yet it is crazy just just to be just that type of that mind state that so long ago it, we're going to this place and we're gonna do some shit. I Dunno if what we're doing

Speaker 5:          01:23:04       well, it's notorious when someone shows up in a boat, like this is probably the only time in human history that when a boat full of strangers shows up in your store, people aren't going to die every other time in human history. Once that boat showed up, most likely people were fucking dying. Most likely some terrible shit's going to get down some crazy desperadoes who are starving to death. I'm going to hop off that boat and they're going to have swords and bows and arrows and canons and they're going to go cause they're hungry. Fuck yeah, they're hungry. There's that. Scurvy is no pussy. They're eating rats and fucking old rice. I mean, what? What are they going to do when they get off their, they're going to, they're going to take whatever they want. They're gonna, they're gonna go crazy. Especially when there's no Twitter.

Speaker 7:          01:23:46       Yeah. Notes later to say, hey man, chill a chill out on the pillaging. I get the last hundred years.

Speaker 5:          01:23:52       Probably the only time where it's not a terrifying moment when a boat pulls up every other time before that, the 17 hundreds or whatever it was, what, 1492 Columbus sailed the ocean blue, all that shit. That was a terrible time when someone pulled up in a boat. Terrible time. Boats. A like, yeah. Tanks and then tanks. Now when tanks pull up, something bad is happening or it was happening or it was about to happen. Exactly. A battleship. Yeah. Yeah. That's all

Speaker 7:          01:24:22       law. Do you think they knew that something terrible was going to happen right away? Or was it they were, they were open at first, right?

Speaker 5:          01:24:28       Well, did you ever see that movie? There's a movie. Um, I think it's what the bleep do we know that try, I think it's, this movie tries to present this argument. They think that the native Americans might not have even been able to see the boat because they had no point of reference, which is stupid as fuck. To me, that would make no sense because there's a lot of unique events that you only see for the first time. I like the idea that they wouldn't be able to see it. It's, I think it's just some woo woo bullshit. I think it's some nonscientific bullshit that some people try to pass off. That's my take on it as a nonscientific bullshit artist. Yeah. But, uh, I think they wouldn't have known what the fucker was if they had never seen a boat before. And then all of a sudden, like when the conquistadores landed, the, the, the people who live like the Aztecs thought that they were gods because they never seen a person on a horse before. They'd never seen that. They didn't know what the fuck was going on. They saw these people on horses. They thought the horse was a part of them. They thought they were gods. I didn't never seen anything before. It's crazy. They think that a one point in time, most of North America did not have horses. The horses were brought here from somewhere else. So the native American Indians didn't use to have horses in the beginning.

Speaker 7:          01:25:35       Wow. Wait. So they brought horses on these boats or horses came from somewhere else. Wow. So horse, that was horrible boat ride. Cause you talking about days and days with a horse with a horse weeks and feeding weeks, probably

Speaker 5:          01:25:50       months, right? I mean how long did it take for Columbus to get from Spain to The Bahamas? I don't know. I don't know how to be months. I would imagine it would be months, months of travel. Monster travel makes sense. When you're on a boat that has to get blown around by the wind. You're

Speaker 2:          01:26:04       trying to get across the biggest body of water known to man, that Shit's ridiculous. Uh, ocean, you gotta get across the ocean on a floating piece of a tree. That's the stupidest fucking thing I've ever heard. So did you go

Speaker 7:          01:26:14       deal with horses? So do you get to take everything was you think he just felt inside out? Just like man, it was as loud as fuck.

Speaker 2:          01:26:21       I think people back then were ruthless. I think they were dealing with completely different times. People died younger. The, the amount of time you were on this planet was very short. The average person didn't get their shit together.

Speaker 7:          01:26:34       30 30 something you liked about it. Was it,

Speaker 2:          01:26:36       I mean there was a few people that live longer, but most people probably died off at 30 well, and also the infant mortality rate was so high that it lowers the, the, the average age of death. It lowers it because of that. Like an infant mortality was through the roof. It was like 50% of the kids would die back then. Like during the Roman times, I believe it was 50% child mortality rain. He had two kids. One would be dead for sure. He's, yeah. And that's normal. That was normal. So I think their, their whole idea of like what, what's violent and what's evil, what's good, what's bad. It was just completely different. They were used to way more barbarism, way more murder, weight, the weight, you know, they would Mary Antoinette, they would, they would fucking think about when they would have those gigantic town executions and they would use the gay teen cut someone's fucking head off in the town square. We just think that people used to do that.

Speaker 7:          01:27:27       That was, that is, that is, that is pretty. But like we like now to Getty is kind of, you know, used as a joke in movies on stuff like, yeah, the kids eat. But yeah, the fact that that was real is insane.

Speaker 2:          01:27:42       It was real and it removed your head and you were conscious for a few minutes for you before you would die, your head would be separated from your body, your body would be dying. But as the oxygen in your brain is slowly leaking out like you are your conscious for probably not a few minutes, but probably at least a few seconds we'll use it. Man has fucked up looking up at a basket and you're like, oh, you gotta be fucking kidding. I didn't do anything that bad. When you, all you gotta do was pick the wrong person off that had power and they would just be off with their head. It would just off with your hand. That was like a common thing.

Speaker 7:          01:28:16       Can we talk, can we talk it through a little bit? You need any work, work

Speaker 2:          01:28:19       done? No. Oh, it isn't it funny too that they would do that shit publicly. Like that's what we avoid now. We don't want the public even seeing coffins. Yeah. Like you're not allowed to take photographs of a coffins of veterans when they're coming back. Yeah. The Bush administration made that illegal, which is kind of fucking crazy. You're not even allowed to see a picture of someone who dies at war. Forget about c like a prisoner getting executed. You know a lot to see any of that shit. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I don't want to see that prisoner getting executed. If I sent you a link, you'd click it. If I sent you a link and it says, uh, you know, okay, let's just think of someone just undeniably, uh, Hitler. Okay. If I sent you a link and it, dude, you want to watch this video? This is a Hitler getting executed. How's he getting executed? It's going to get his head cut off the sword. What mental state am I in? Sova junk. Hi. Uh, depends on when you get home. Uh, saying the email. 7:00 PM.

Speaker 7:          01:29:20       What other emails do I have?

Speaker 2:          01:29:25       And you had some new information about your standup comedy special and to be out on comedy central.

Speaker 7:          01:29:30       Yeah. On a, yeah, it's out on comedy central direct right now. It comes out midnight on a Saturday on comedy central. Yeah. Some information about that or, or the Hitler thing. Oh yeah. Click that Shit, man.

Speaker 2:          01:29:43       Yeah, I'd click it to, I've clicked on some shit. I shouldn't have clicked. Yeah. The most recent one was um, some Mexican dude cut in his girlfriend's head off or cheating one of the drug lords. Like it's, it's so obviously real as fuck. So obviously really good.

Speaker 7:          01:30:01       His boys will, who's filming it?

Speaker 2:          01:30:03       His friends. Yeah. It was one of the cartel guys as crazy. You know, there's some crazy cartel videos, just cartel videos and I'm using chain saws and cut and dude's heads off,

Speaker 7:          01:30:12       but almost, I mean, I know how fucked up it is to cut your girlfriend's head off of cheating, but in that you almost understand. No, no, no. I'm talking about in their world where he's all about Latin machismo. Yeah. It also be a cartel leader and your girlfriend and everybody knowing this, he cheated. Like he has to maintain his Kartell Shit. That's true. If you're going to be awful, it's awful. Nobody's bugging. Say Annabelle condones beheading of cheating too late, like know the right and the salon.com right now, but part of rape culture. But that is that as is saying. Do you have that up there? I'm glad I didn't look.

Speaker 2:          01:30:54       Uh, we didn't have it up. Yeah, no, no, we're not going to show you. I don't want to see that shit. Yeah, but that's, that's it. Cut. He did a knife as recent. Oh yeah. It's hard to watch, man. It's really hard to walk. Then you hold her head up.

Speaker 7:          01:31:07       The reason she was cheating is because he was so busy running the carts. I don't know what their history was. What? I'm assuming he's in the wrong. I'm sure running a card sale is very time consuming and Sud needed some Dick. He's still, it doesn't mean that she didn't love him.

Speaker 2:          01:31:25       Yeah. I would say the same. If I was there while this argument was going down, he's like, I'm going to cut her fucking head off. Like, dude, relax. You come on, she's, she appreciates you. Let's kick it was, she was just needed some attention. She needed a little Dick. Come on. Now let's look at it this way. You got to fucking green light cheat. However you, they actually have the green light and the cartel. They just do whatever the fuck they want. But yeah, at this point in time, I mean how much money those guys have their, I mean they, they have cartels where the, the head guys have like $1 billion. Like, yeah, this, it's like make Al Capone look ridiculous.

Speaker 7:          01:31:59       Are we in

Speaker 5:          01:32:00       danger of being attacked by the cartel now? I don't think so. I don't think they've ever developed like real legitimate military power. But what they have developed as local power, like they don't have no, I mean me and you as individuals. No, we haven't said anything bad. Oh, okay. Cool. What did we said bad? I don't know. They make a lot of money. They don't tolerate cheating. All right. Yeah. So are we kind of cartel propaganda? That's interesting. If we were probably, if we were cartel sympathizers, yeah, but I don't think we are. I don't think so. I think what we are is, look, the whole reason why cartels exists, but we were talking about earlier, should cocaine be legal? We'll have cocaine's not legal. Who's going to sell it because people were going to smoke it, snort it, smoke it, whatever they do with it, shoot it. Some people shoot it, they're going to do it. They're going to do it. Who's going to profit? Right? Criminals. Is it better to have Pfizer or sell coke or is it better to have the, the, the, the mafia down in Pfizer. I say Pfizer, I say led Pfizer profit off.

Speaker 7:          01:32:56       So Joe was just saying is that if Kokei was legal, this woman was still be alive.

Speaker 5:          01:33:04       You know what, you might have a point there

Speaker 7:          01:33:06       I think. I mean, it's a long way to go, but it does. You know, I think that's what it is. Well, I definitely think some people would be alive. Yeah. There would be less violence, less violence. It'd be less money spent in jails on jails.

Speaker 5:          01:33:22       Don in Portugal is a clear indicator that we're on the wrong path with, with keeping everything illegal and locking people up, putting private prisons up, throwing people in. They're profiting off the fact they're in their Portugal. They've lowered everything. They've lowered the rates of addiction. They've lowered violent crime. They lower the amount of money they have to spend on legal fees and courts and prisons. They load all that shit just by decriminalizing all drugs. They just made it so that people aren't fucking locked up as criminals anymore. Yeah. For a choice, choose alcohol, which will fuck you up, man. You and I. Okay. Listen, I was in the apple store last week, trust me, but we could get fucked up in like 20 minutes. Jamie could go back there, breakout some whiskey, and we could just start doing shots within 15 minutes. We would be unrecognizable. Right. You could get fucked up in like a short amount of time with alcoholic or really short amount of time. Yeah. Why is that legal and coke stock by arbitrary. Completely arbitrary. It doesn't make no logical sense. There's no, it doesn't make sense. The same type of person who would go on a coat bench will also go on a drunken rampage. Yeah.

Speaker 9:          01:34:34       Okay.

Speaker 7:          01:34:35       Well you can't go on a coke rampage. You go on both. Okay.

Speaker 5:          01:34:39       You can go on a a drunken binge. Yeah, you can go on a drunken rampage. You can go on a coke binge or a coke rampage. Yeah.

Speaker 9:          01:34:47       Okay.

Speaker 5:          01:34:47       But I agree. I agree with you. I'd rather be around the guy on coke. So there, well, here you go. You got to a drunk, you know, drunk problem. Americans got a giant drunk problem. We've got alcohol everywhere. People die of alcohol, but the hundreds of thousands Savis [inaudible] all that shit. What's better though? Coke drivers or drunk drivers? I don't know man. I think, uh, I don't know. I don't notice. That's man. If you had to guess, if I had to guess, would you rather be in a car with a dude? Is coked up or dude, he's drunk and he's driving. I think

Speaker 7:          01:35:20       the cooktop, dude, we'll be driving fast, but he'll make those lanes shifts like a mother.

Speaker 6:          01:35:32       He'll be, he'll be pulling right into parking spots that you'd normally have to parallel and so he just pulled right in tight spots. Slide two. Let's open up a driving business. I'm fucking awesome. [inaudible] we had to do cool drivers. Cool man. When I was kid, I pass it. The first time I tried I had to written shit. The driver's shit. I got all the information at the knowledge. My got books. I just need $100,000 come on man. Let's do this. Let's make money. Let's make money. Would be under year. Come on man. We'll get some bitches.

Speaker 5:          01:36:08       Great. Yeah, he definitely, I would talk to the coke guy first and I would drive with the coke guy first. Look at that.

Speaker 7:          01:36:16       Philoso I would, what am, I would probably try to drive to, but that was, that fucks up everything.

Speaker 5:          01:36:22       Oh, I would definitely drive if I had the option, it would be the guy driving over the drunk driver or the coke driver. Oh definitely. Yeah. But if you couldn't drive for,

Speaker 7:          01:36:33       I'm injured and I need somebody to take me to the hospital and only only person is the coke for an audit drunk friend Coke Fran. It's taken me to the hospital.

Speaker 5:          01:36:40       Yeah. Or you're on the walking dead and you get picked up on the side of the road and you're just happy. It's not a zombie dude is on coke. You got it wrote. Yeah, I would definitely, if I had to fight zombies, you'd want to do some, I want to do this on coke with me fighting zombies viewed on PCP a PCP. Yeah. That's the kind. That's the mother fucker you want. But he would make your rational choices. What about they do? They do crazy shit, but he'd be all right.

Speaker 7:          01:37:06       He had a string or met somebody on maths fighting zombies.

Speaker 5:          01:37:09       That's a good move to which is like an accelerated version of Adderall. Yeah. Really? Yeah. Yeah, it is. Yeah. Somehow or another related Adderall put the teeth. The teeth part. That's the real accelerated teeth part. The teeth thing. What do you mean teeth thing and the destroying your face thing. Oh, we would met with math. Yeah. Oh yeah. Rots your teeth out. Brushing teeth out. Just any form of speed. Once they started doing speed, I think they forget to brush too. That's part of it. If I were to just,

Speaker 7:          01:37:38       [inaudible] is a real avid. I haven't done that much research on math because it hasn't affected my life that much. Isn't that messed up? Let me, sometimes I restart stuff that hasn't had to deal with me, but meth mouth is a, is a real is a real issue,

Speaker 5:          01:37:52       dude. It's in Wikipedia. You're 100% right. Meth mouth

Speaker 7:          01:37:56       as is a turn by itself. It is. Look, I'm lucky. Pedia oh, it's horrible. Yeah. Go to meth mouth on Wiki, so I don't think there's anything called Adderall mouth that's just dry mouth. Do you drink a lot of water and hydrate yourself? You embed a hill.

Speaker 2:          01:38:12       This is insane. Oh my God. Sent in addition, characterized by severe decay and loss of teeth as well as fracture and namel erosion and other oral problems. Symptomatic of extended use of the drug. Methamphetamine, the specific cause that condition is unknown. Although drug induced Zeros, zero stoma, zero stomion Xerostomia or dry mouth. Why don't just call it dry mouth. Why you gotta get crafty? Something I can't even pronounce as well as Bruxism, which is grinding of the teeth. I thought to be involved. Wow, this is crazy. They grind their own fucking teeth off. That picture is a classic meth mouth. You could tell by looking at the other teeth, a person isn't even that fucking old. They just did some crazy shit to their teeth. Yeah, I hope to party was awesome. Poor nutrition, eating too much sugar, lack of dental hygiene, common among longterm uses of the drugs. I didn't know that meth users eat a lot of sugar, but that totally makes sense. The legitimacy of meth mouth as a unique condition has been questioned because of the similar effects of some other drugs on the teeth. Treating meth mouth is difficult.

Speaker 7:          01:39:27       Yeah. Cause your teeth are gone. You can't, but that's the best treatment for math. Math is uh, veneers.

Speaker 2:          01:39:35       Yeah. You'd have to just chew them all down and get some dental implants. Teeth, some bulletproof teeth. Yeah, man. Yeah. You're seeing a person has like a, like a tooth where they do the route they the gentle implant.

Speaker 7:          01:39:48       No, that does crazy veneers though. I got TV teeth. You got some, uh, what'd they do? They scrape the outside off and put a beautiful shell these front and far as TV teeth. Man, it's a beautiful, let me say smile. Oh those are pretty, yeah man. Did they make him perfect? Is that what it is? That's how you got him. Yeah. Cause I had a chipped tooth then a gap and I was like, man, I'm probably going to be on TV a lot in the next few years. Let me fix this real quick. So I got it fixed in 2011 I got them fixed.

Speaker 2:          01:40:16       There's something sexy about a really hot girl with a gap in her teeth.

Speaker 7:          01:40:20       Something like extra sexy. I get girls would gaps used to connect with me and like you got a cap. I got a gap. I'm like, not for long. It doesn't bother me though. Does it bother you if a pretty girl has a gap in her teeth? No, not at all. Not even a little bit, right? No, not at all. It was just my own thing when I was like, I'm to be on TV. I don't want to have cracked teeth on TV,

Speaker 2:          01:40:37       but a gap is different than snaggle teeth. Yeah. If there's all, they're all snuggled up, my bottom teeth are kind of snuggle. Yeah, sure. Fine. One is one that goes back to fucked up. I'm not going to get it fixed. I'm a man. Okay. And my top ones are, I don't give a shit,

Speaker 5:          01:40:54       but if I was a girl, yeah. Nobody wants to look at us. Snaggley tooth mouth girl.

Speaker 7:          01:40:59       Yeah. It's just a yes. Natalie is. Yeah. Snaggley is not a good look.

Speaker 5:          01:41:03       It's not good when you get the extra teeth. Those weird people that have extra teeth that pop out of the gums and weird spots. Yeah. S It's just, you know, all men are not created equal. Why don't we give a fuck? Why? Why does anybody care about if someone's teeth are not perfectly in line? Like what is, what part of our brain is being bothered by the lack of symmetry.

Speaker 7:          01:41:24       Yeah. It's just, that's what it is. Is this symmetry. I don't know what part it is, but people like symmetry for the same reason. It might, I mean it wouldn't anger me, but if this painting was like a little bit off, it's a little bit off. The other ones look down point, but if it was a little bit off, I would, I would notice it.

Speaker 5:          01:41:42       It would fuck with you. Fuck with me. I should tilt Jimi Hendrix noticeably just to fuck with the next gas. Yeah, just leave it there kind of cockeyed and not say shit about it. Yeah. I'm going to do that. Don't, don't tell Adam Carolla I'm going to fuck with them. I'm going to twist that shit up. Yeah. So it's just, I think, yeah, it's just the human brain likes, you know, symmetry, symmetry. Perfect. Lions you, Yup. Yeah, but why, but why? I don't know. At a certain point in time, logic should take over, but it doesn't, there's certain shit just looks

Speaker 7:          01:42:12       good man. You know? I mean, just like if somebody got a weird tooth, it's just the same reason why, you know, if your car got, if your car got hit in the, in the, in the front headlight and smashed in a little bit, the car still runs well. But you want that shit fixed cause it looks like

Speaker 5:          01:42:27       dumb. I agree with you 100%. I'm just trying to figure out why. Why sit? We like shit. It looks good man. I know we do, but in that, why weird, right? Like are you a car guy? Do you like cars? I do like cars. Like what's your favorite car

Speaker 7:          01:42:43       view? Faith. Actually favorite. If they're listening. I liked the Lincoln Mkx.

Speaker 5:          01:42:49       That's a beautiful car. A, yeah. I liked that. Cuts of spaceship. Yeah, I liked that car. And, uh, what else? I mean I like some bins is uh, yeah, it was, will pull up the 2014 Mercedes Benz s class, pull up a picture of this. This is like a, you know, if you think about like the cream of the crop of like luxury automobiles, like a Mercedes Benz. Like there's no ugly Mercedes Benz. They have a bunch of German scientists that are fucking trying to figure out what the symmetry is. Pull up, go to do a Google search of silver, 2014 Mercedes Benz s class. Look out this is there. There's something beautiful about it and escape Lee. Beautiful. But when you look at the picture, like why, like what the fuck is it? Like what is it about that sign? And it's just, yeah, it looks slick as fuck of that.

Speaker 5:          01:43:40       That grill, that's where it was a big part of it. You can't say shit about that car. No one could say that's not a good looking car. Yeah, that's a masterpiece, right? They, they designed to make it smooth and probably if you get in that car and drive off your home, mother fucker was going somewhere. Yeah. Someone who sits in that car and they're ad traffic. That's a guy who was doing, or a gal that was doing well. You have a beautiful car. Looked at him and he was Mercedes Benz. The smooth car. Right. But probably brides. Well why does it look good? Well why some things look good to you and they don't look good to me. Like here's something, I have a friend who loves those fucking stupid Mercedes. Uh, those bread truck looking things. Those old school ones are little square cleanser or the, what do they called?

Speaker 5:          01:44:30       They look like a jeep. A jeep. But it's, the bit is, I think he's talking about us friends or some people used to miss tour bus. Oh No, that one. That put g five. Yeah, that's the one. I take it back. Mercedes doesn't make one AWG we car. It's this one that's ugly as far I wouldn't, I don't like, I guess it's just, but sometimes the brand can take over. It is totally take over it and it should square as fuck. But people love it. Yeah, I mean don't get me wrong, somebody gave me one. I would drive it. I'm sure it's lovely to drive. Mercedes is their masterpieces of engineering. But you know, look at that and then like look at a new range rover. You want to look at like a beautiful SUV, pull up the image of the new range rover and you see like a futuristic, beautiful looking SUV.

Speaker 5:          01:45:13       But it's why, what is it? What is, why do I like one or the other? I've, I never could figure out what it is that appeals. I don't know what it is. This, it's a, it's this varies by person. Like I got these shoes, a company sent me these shoes and they send me some shoes that look great and they send me some shoes and I'm like, what the fuck? I would never wear this. And so my little cousin, she was visiting me from college, he visited me in New York last week and I was like, look at these ugly fucking shoes. They look like if Chester Cheetah will a prideful and she was like, those look great. Those what I want to get those to my boy, the whole shoes a Austin and I was like, what the fuck? And so it's just subjective, you know what I mean?

Speaker 5:          01:45:53       People, people, you know, people. It's just subjective. It's some people's eyes like different things. Some people have different aesthetics and just taste and that's what it is. Cause I thought those shoes were gross and I will never wear, I still won't ever wear them, but there's some people that might like those shoes. I thought, yeah, I'm totally with you. I always wondered. I want to see that's a new a look at the difference between those two. This is, this is a boxy in bread truck and that's a space ship. That's a beautiful spaceship. Yeah. I've always wanted to know what you see. Like anybody, any other person I was, I assume that everybody sees what I say, right? I assume that you know when you're looking at meth mouth you see the same thing I'm looking at when you're looking at these pictures. But I don't know. You know, I really don't know. I'm just guessing. I mean, imagine if you use somebody whose eyes have you see through somebody and the whole world. Completely different. Totally different vibe. What do you mean s c just as far as the visual

Speaker 7:          01:46:50       or see as far as how people process things. Both with the brain. What else at totally different. That's crazy. Oh, do you? You'd probably use you smoke so you probably like God, do I look when I move around to other will you ever see yourself on video and you're like, Whoa, what was that like that? Oh Shit, I was fat then I was a fat day. Oh Man, I should've got a haircut. Oh Man. My posture. I actually, you know it's funny. Well My, I did a, I did Letterman a couple of years ago and I hate it cause my suit is horrible, but now he's my suit. Horrible. But my entrance is sucks. I walk out on Letterman and I'm like bounding Alec. And I guess the word is no comp. It means calm. But isn't that like I don't look hot. Thought I looked when I was walking out. I'm like, yeah, I'm walking out on Letterman and my mind and I see the video.

Speaker 7:          01:47:41       Can you pull it up? I seen the video. I'm like, like it's not, it's just like real heavy. Look at, maybe I'm over analyzing the too, but that's sued is horrible. I'm gonna get that garbage suited and wrong with that suit. That suit is garbage. It's garbage about it. The fit of it is tight. It's weird. I think I buttoned the wrong button. It's a weird fit. I think it's fine. Did you, did you get crazy when you high when you looked at this and get freaked out by it? No. It's just when it like, yeah, I mean me and my girlfriend gives me shit about it sometimes. Like she gives a shit about that video. Yeah, it was horrible. Or was another tie. What? Horrible suit. Because I got better suits now so I'll see it and I'm like, man, that's suits sucks you a suit guy.

Speaker 7:          01:48:29       Do you get like your suits tailored? I got my first tailored suit a few weeks ago for this event idea for the Bulls in Chicago, so I needed a suit last minute, so I like, I splurged on a suit and got a nice one and it was, it was killing and I'm making sure that I, I wear as many events as I can just to get my money's worth for the suit. That's a sign of being a grownup man. You get a nice suit. Yeah, it was. He tell it there and it felt slick and it was a, it was a smooth suit and it, it, that's what made me realize that my other suits with garbage. When I put on a good suit, I was like Internet. I'm like, this is, this is how a suit should look. I looked at the other shelter like, Oh fuck. I was on TV like that.

Speaker 7:          01:49:09       My every TV special I've ever done has been like a tee shirt or you know, largely tee shirt, jeans. Usually I don't want to trust in a way that I don't normally dress where I'm comfortable. Right. You know? Yeah. I don't for my like for TV appraisers just to, or like a late night shows like doing a set, I'll put on a suit just to out of respect for the show, you know what I mean? But uh, like for my special, my first one I just want to button up and then my latest one, I just, I wore a jacket over, a nice jacket over a t shirt. What does this, this is amazing because like that's just jeans and tee shirt. Would you put a jacket? People like, Holy Shit, you look great. Yeah. Just what a jacket over my regular shit jacket makes you look like you're a professional. But also it just makes people you like, it's funny how close will determine how people just approach you and just how people treat you and how people talk to you and how people respond to this shit. You have to say like a jacket or a suit and we'll just change.

Speaker 2:          01:50:13       Especially if you're a young man, you know, especially if you're like a man in his twenties. A guy in his twenties with a suit is totally different than a guy in his twenties but a tee shirt.

Speaker 7:          01:50:21       Yeah, it's, yeah, it is. It's just you will elicit that person seems more intelligent all of a sudden put pitfall, more respectful. They, it's weird that, that, that that's like how did that, I think about that too, like how did suits become? How did that become the way to dress? Like was one, dude, I'm going to wear this and then people were like, that looks good. What do I get that shit? Yeah, dude, who has like a suit and tie on and he's holding a clipboard automatically take them seriously. You take them seriously. You defer to him. I got to ask him something and let me be respectful. He might shut me down. He might ruin my life. He might ruin my night. The same kid with flip flops on and a tee shirt, a pair of shorts, piece of shit. How do you get this job? Who is he? Yeah. Imagine if you went to

Speaker 2:          01:51:06       a Mercedes dealership and you wanted to buy one of those beautiful cars. Like I work in mine on the counters wearing fucking flip flops and shorts and wants to sign. He's telling you all this crazy shit about Mercedes, Mercedes, that the engineering is the finest in all of Europe and what they do. And you'd be like, I mean listen to this fucking idiot was stupid.

Speaker 7:          01:51:24       I'm looking at it, look at his feet, look at his toes. He got something in between his toes. But you know what I don't like is it sometimes people will use that against you where I'll stay at a nice hotel and a person, there's time people at the hotel, it dress nice and they'll, they'll take on a vibe like they own the hotel. It was like relax, relax a little bit. Oh Sir, we do not allow that in, in this shot to a mamoosh ma. And I want to say, sir, I think you make 30 to 50,000 a year comp that like they, but they talk like it this way. Like get a king, like Whoa, relax a little bit. And so like maybe, and then maybe if I had on a suit I'd be like, sir, you shut the fuck up. I'm also a suits right now. That's true. Right, right.

Speaker 2:          01:52:12       You wear flip flops and a dude is wearing a suit. He automatically is one up in you. And if you, you could be a rich fucking dude unless you got a crazy fat watch. If you show up. Yeah. Have you checking in a fancy hotel and you were in the flip flops, but you got some stupid fucking gigantic $20,000 watch on your arm and people know it and you're gesturing with your hands a lot. And he says big fucking chunky diamond crusted watch like a, okay, we got to listen. And Scott. Yeah, let them talk a little bit. It's got some money.

Speaker 7:          01:52:43       But yeah, I mean I think that's what I do. I actually liked dressing horribly in, in a high level situations like I love, I get upgraded or I fly first a lot and I love being in like jogging pants. I love being a young black dude jogging pants. If first class people like, Ooh, I think it will fit it hat on and my headphones and people like what the fuck is he? How is he, what do you think he and my favorite thing, I don't know what it is if it's my demeanor or whatever, but I like it cause I like mine. Nobody ever talks to me at first just about nobody. Nobody ever. I'm always rich, rich, celebrity. Nobody ever talks to me in first. Where's my girl was, she'll fly for like, I hear about her, she'll tell it. I talked this business guy was blah, blah blah. And now I'm at this rapper was on the plane with me and this is like, these people will just babble, monster hurt, Babel monsters or turn my cousin mate. Well some people just talk to you when you don't want them to talk like, Oh, people monopolize the conversation babble. But just people were just talking obviously cause he's a girl. But this is a funny thing where people won't even engage usually with me on the plane,

Speaker 5:          01:54:01       I got an ear beating from me and Tommy [inaudible] girl. Do you know Tom Segura? Yeah, me and Thomas Grower. We're on a flight once. And this woman who was the, uh, the attendant on the flight, she gave us the most unbelievable ear beating I've ever experienced in my life. It was just staggering. Good. Her Stamina, her ability to not recognize clues, the whole thing. She asked us, we would like some wine and a, we said a, sure, and I forget what Tommy asked for it for that asked for Cabernet or Pinot Noir. Like, do you have a, you know, you have a, whatever you asked for a typical, and she started cracking some jokes about the movie sideways. Do you ever see that movie? I have. It's a movie about, um, it's with, um, um, the dude from wings. That's a fucking cool ass guy's name. Fucking shit.

Speaker 5:          01:54:52       What's his name? The Dude Church. Uh, what the fuck is this? Danny Thomas Haden Church, uh, who's a very cool guy actually. Um, and uh, you know, it's all about wine. It's just so she starts reciting this scene. It's like that scene and you know, blah, blah, blah. And then she goes, well, I've never really been into wine, but I'll tell you why. There was a guy once that you know, he had the bottle of wine he brings to the rest and she's just going on and on and on, and I'm not exaggerating like 15 minutes. She won't shut the fuck up. She just hovering over this chair and we're panicking. This is it. On a plane, on the fucking plane. The flight attendants on the fucking plane. Oh, lean over the seat. Just beating us into submission with stupid ass story. And so I start writing down, I, I'm in the window seat and he's in the aisle, so he's stuck with [inaudible] band in him and just start looking out the window. I was like, I can't do anymore. I have to start looking

Speaker 2:          01:55:44       at the window. She won't stop. She's just, she's worked her way from the, the quote from the movie sideways to a story about a dude with wine to story about her ex husband and it's a fucking murderer as a salt on the eardrum.

Speaker 7:          01:55:56       Tom was proudly so punch drunk at the time. We could think we said it went to the bathroom.

Speaker 2:          01:56:02       Well, Tommy had a really interesting point because Tommy, I abandoned him and I left him to to be slaughtered by her and he, uh, he developed a psychological profile of her and say, he said, I think because we were on a small plane, he was a small flight. He goes, I think the reason why this lady's on a small flight is because other ladies don't want to work with her. So they stick around the small flights where she works by herself because she's clueless. She has no one to shut the fuck up and everybody wants to get away from her. I was sticker on these little flights one hour, hour and a half type flight or something like that. Yeah. It wasn't a very long flight. Yeah. I forget where we're going, but the beating that just, yeah, just brutal. You're beating this broad gauge.

Speaker 7:          01:56:41       Yeah. It's tough and it's just, you don't want to feel like a bad product. Like is that even though in your brain is this tough socially, but hey, can you shut the fuck up? Oh he's this, but it's this, it's tough to do. Especially in a confined space like that. Uh, in an air, in an airplane. I mean in a social situation is easier cause you can just say, yeah, I'm about to go, go to the, go to the bar, you need anything I'm going to get. And they usually don't need a drink, but that's the way to cut people off. I'm going to get a drink.

Speaker 2:          01:57:05       Yeah. You or you say, excuse me, I gotta use the restroom. I hate to be rude, but I have to use the restroom. And then I would just drop my phone and start looking forward in between the seat and hopefully would just, she would find a reason to keep walking. Yeah. But she would, she would do it not just to us. She did it to everybody. She decided to stop with. We watched her. She went, she got done beating us up. She went over to somebody else and beat them up. So she was a social terrorist. She was a terrorist, wants to the terrorist one on that night. I had to jump out real quick to the bathroom. Go ahead man. Go ahead. Don't worry about it. I'll tell everybody about, uh, my show. I got coming up soon. A lot of people, folks, they can't handle these three hour conversations.

Speaker 2:          01:57:43       They don't develop the bladder control that a man like me has. You know, it's a man like me sitting here two hours plus and I'm not feeling it. I'm fine. Two hours and 10 minutes. By the way, if you ever watch a UFC, this is an inside joke and you hear me talking. Only me talking while the fighter is walking from the back room to the cage. That means Mike Goldberg went to pee because my goal burpees like crazy. I don't know what's going on with my Goldberg. He tells me everything's fine. I believe him, but I have a hard time believing a man can pee as much as Michael burpees. I don't, I don't even understand it. It doesn't even make sense to me. Like, I'll go to take a leak, don't get me wrong because um, a lot of times I'll have a cup of coffee there.

Speaker 2:          01:58:29       I'll have a couple of bottles of water. You want to keep hydrated while you're screaming and yelling. So I will get up and go to take a leak, but I'll do it. And then an hour later, like he'll do another one, like we'll go together and this motherfuck will pee again inside of an hour. And I don't know how he does it, but heal the most he ever did so far. You know in a UFC event is six, he peed six times. My cohost in UFC, Mike Goldberg, who's a Great Guy But likes to pee. So apparently he enjoys running out to the bathroom and taking lynx. Was he drinking a lot of waters? He just says a lot of water and drinks red bulls and shit like that too. While we're doing the broadcast is taken off six times an hour. No, in a show. And it's showing a whole UFC show, which is like six hours where the fights hot us. I mean if he's, you know, sort of still ridiculous man, you know, this is what you're doing. Sit down.

Speaker 7:          01:59:20       Yeah. If you do it, I guess if you do a TV yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:59:25       Strengthen your pee. Yeah. But uh, for, you know, just for most people as they get older, apparently that becomes an issue. Dude's develop prostate problems and your, your, your prostate enlarges. I know this because I had to get my dog fixed, my dog's prostate and large so much that it was constipated.

Speaker 7:          01:59:44       That's your dog fix was a, a metaphor

Speaker 6:          01:59:48       prostate. And I noticed how I get that

Speaker 7:          01:59:54       shit. Is this, what happens after four?

Speaker 2:          01:59:56       Doug was six and he's uh, he's um, he developed a enlarge prostate. I had to get them fixed shit. Johnny Cash no longer has balls. He seems happy though. He was, he was actually getting constipated because of it was really interesting. Like it was blocking up. Was pinching. Where's Colin is. Yeah. Poor dog.

Speaker 7:          02:00:15       They, uh, when I was on that a goat farm, a worker with them, they had, they had me, uh, I was milking the garden and they brought one gold in. They had me bring, there's this one young, uh, male goat, anything like you want to name them? And I was like, yeah, name names [inaudible] they're boy. You sure? And they're like, yeah. And in a band they were like, we're going to band them and they put a band around his balls. And so Ebay, they do like a delay. Castration isn't that like they cut it off. They, they put the band on in the is fall off two weeks later. But I didn't like that they told me, they sent me up to name him. Uh, and then they were like, and now, yeah, he's not going to have balls in a little while. Like that's pretty shitty. Yo. Well they were going to do that anyway. They were going to do it anyway, but they didn't have to have me hold him as they did it.

Speaker 2:          02:01:06       Yeah. That's kind of fucked. Yeah. To them it's normal.

Speaker 7:          02:01:09       Yeah. But no, it was, I mean, I guess it will be all right TV, but after she kind of made me feel weird.

Speaker 2:          02:01:16       You know, human beings do that to themselves sometimes too. That's like one of the ways that men castrate themselves is that they use like rubber bands and tighten it all up and it all just goes dead. Then they saw it off.

Speaker 7:          02:01:26       Wait, who? What type of duties? I castrate in themselves.

Speaker 2:          02:01:29       A lot of crazy fucking people out there, man. There's um, there was a wedding, a website called a BME extreme that's from the, there's a video, the BME pain

Speaker 5:          02:01:40       Olympics. See that acronym? Yeah. I don't know. Apparently there's no real pain Olympics. It's not real, but they called this video. The BME don't pull that up, but there's a, a video of a bunch of dudes hack and their dicks off and cutting their balls out and people have done it. It's definitely happened. And they've done it on video. This people have cut their fingers off on video and put the video online, cut the tip of their finger off with a sword. People are fun. Yeah. It's crazy. One off activities. Yeah. You want, can't repeat that repeat last. Just champion. That's a one off. It wasn't worth it. Some weird thing where some people like to do that for whatever reason they want to, they want to castrate themselves like they, like it's, it's more common than not. In fact, you know, that's what they're trying to, you know, release themselves from this Bin is one sec. So much like, you know, the way I deleted my Twitter APP.

Speaker 5:          02:02:40       Exactly. And, but then they realized they wanted it afterwards. But you know, I can reinstall Twitter. We'll, you know, supposedly I had read this about Nikola Tesla, the famous inventor that he did something he didn't explain, explain what he did, but in quotes destroyed his sexuality. He had some really confusing, uh, love situation with some woman apparently. And he just got it just ruined everything, ruined his life, ruined his work. He just got messed up with some chick and then decide to, in quotes, destroy his sexuality. And I don't know if that's true or not, but you're talking about a guy and Nicola Tesla who was a crazy genius inventor who also was in love with a pigeon thought this pigeon. He was like in love with this pigeon and this weird romantic interest in a pigeon before he died. He said completely off the rails. So does he deserve to have a car named after him on that?

Speaker 5:          02:03:35       He's a bad motherfucker. He wasn't. No. It's crazy. If humans are never perfect, no one knew. No one retires with an undefeated record. Not even Floyd Mayweather along the way, he takes some losses, losses, and uh, you know, making out with a pigeon never made out with it. I think he just was in love with a picture of what it visit and destroyed his own. Again, that's what I read. That could be propaganda. I'm exposing propaganda left and rights. It might be, might be propaganda. Might not be real. Like Napoleon did, you know, to Polian wasn't short. Whoa. That's a mind fuck. In fact, he was taller than average for the time. Please. He's like five, eight, five, six, five, six. Yeah, for France. Let's find out. Napoleon. Napoleon Polian is real height, but I mean, that's a standard, right? Oh, he's got an Napoleon complex. A standard five foot six. Yeah. So back then when people have no fucking nutrition whatsoever, that was actually taller than average. Okay, so, so the Polian complex, this means

Speaker 2:          02:04:38       you want to take all of this shit? Yeah, it depends. This actually, this one actually says 5.7

Speaker 2:          02:04:46       it's five five foot, seven inches. This one says whatever it was for. Then back then, that wasn't nearly short as it is now. Like I'm five eight and I'm short for today for 2014 when people have good nutrition. Yeah, but back then that was actually a tall guy. Like there was a regular size guy. There was like a guy was like five 11 wow. Yeah, it's like normal. Maybe not even five of this. Five 11 five 10 what does average five nine, seven or something like that in five. Eight oh, sorry, I'm about five. 10 let's find out. I got him. Napoleon complex. What's the average height? What's the average American height? What's the average?

Speaker 1:          02:05:25       Okay.

Speaker 2:          02:05:26       Male American.

Speaker 1:          02:05:28       Okay.

Speaker 2:          02:05:28       All right. Okay. Let's see. I'm saying five nine

Speaker 1:          02:05:33       yeah.

Speaker 2:          02:05:33       The average us is five. 10

Speaker 1:          02:05:37       okay.

Speaker 2:          02:05:38       Oh, the average. Yup. Yeah, no. Yeah, that's, yeah, that's what is that average. So they're saying, is that that higher, taller than average? What do you think the average would be? Maybe? Well, this one thing says five, 10 average male American height, average female, male s, uh, is five foot 10 inches. Okay. Yeah. It says, here's another one, and us mail five foot 10 inches. I'll take it. I haven't done as much research as is this. I was just feeling me and my friend. Well, I think it goes up. I think it's gone up definitely since I was born. And I think part of it is nutrition. People understand things and they also noticed stand not to smoke when you were in the womb. I think that's, fuck, that's fucked. A lot of kids up. A lot of women used to smoke when they were, they were probably, my mom smoked.

Speaker 2:          02:06:29       Yeah. Yeah. She's pulling from me and my sister. She apologize to you. Nope. We don't bring it up really well. She got to do apologize for the PAG. Yes. Right. Let go cause a fight. It go. Okay, now it's, yeah. Yeah. Basically. Basically, almost every one of these studies shows it's about five foot 10 from, for for now. Okay. In the U s which is interesting because it's definitely gone up, uh, over a c, what does that average, this is the Netherlands, the USA, France and Japan. Average man. So Japan is the shortest with BMI. And Japan's changing too though, man. There's a lot of much bigger dudes, Japan now than there was like during the World War II days. They're way bigger. So what is the less, the theory behind, uh, Japanese to having a short is, is it just because they don't, uh, mixed with other races as much?

Speaker 2:          02:07:23       And so it's just genetics could be, um, it could, there's a lot of factors. It could be, it could be also that it's an island. You know, it's not, not the biggest place in the world. You know, it's not a tiny island. It's not like re unreal islands, like real small places. They have a thing called island dwarfism or things on that island. Uh, like that's if you are seeing that, that a little creature that they found Homo Floresiensis, he's the hobbit man that they found that lived like 14,000 years ago. We'd never seen that. Oh, fascinating shit, man. 14,000 years ago there was little people that lived alongside human beings that looked just like you or I, and there were these little tiny like hobbit, like creatures. They're like three feet tall and they were a type of human being, not like human, not like Neanderthal, pull up the images.

Speaker 2:          02:08:11       Like there's an, there's an image of a homo floresiensis that they made the hobbit man and uh, this in this island of Flores, they found one and they thought it was like maybe a child's bone or something like that. But then they realized that it was structurally different than a human beings and they thought it might've been just an aberration, like someone who had some sort of a disorder and then they start finding more of them and they found out that they buried their young, they would find like little graveyards and shit. They found stone tools. They realize they use tools and evidence of use of fire. Pretty, pretty insane. She has crazy, that's not that long ago, man, to 14,000 years ago. And what's really crazy is there's people that think that there's something like that that's still alive today. She's at a small, they're small islands.

Speaker 2:          02:08:54       Yeah. See that's, that gives you an idea of it, but there's some good images of those things, but then you see like with the neander tall gorillas, human beings like look how little those fucking things where they were a type of people. Right. That's freaky shit man. That is true. Yeah. And it's real thing. I mean it really existed. What is the big guy on the far right? Not In the end to all, but the guy who just don't, yeah, it was that dude. Jesus. That's a big fucking dude. That looks very apelike too. Like look how long his arms are as Jesus. What's it say? I can't read it. Yeah, whatever it is. We glad we moved past that. Those dudes would be running shit. They were still around. That looks like a combination of like a homosapien and like almost like a gorilla like extra long as arms are.

Speaker 2:          02:09:42       I mean it might be just the artist depiction. It looks like a scary cat to run into on the SAVANNA. Fuck all that. Well apparently there was a, a bunch of um, people that lived in Russia too is recently as, I think it was 40,000 years ago that were completely different than then homosapiens to another, a different site thousand, 40,000 years ago. Didn't NCS or something like that. Here, let me pull that up. A Russian new type of person, type of human 40,000 years ago. Have you been to Japan before? Yeah, it's amazing. It's incredible. It's a really interesting place because um, it's, it's first of all incredibly clean and unbelievably polite and like really almost crime free completely. Like when you walked on the streets, you don't worry about shit every, I mean you're in a major metropolitan area like Tokyo and it seems like the most peaceful place on earth.

Speaker 2:          02:10:38       Very little aggression. Everyone's very polite. People are like, like whether it's shopkeepers are restaurant owners are like, when you're walking on the street, you don't have any sense of chaos like you have in New York City, Israel or the, oh, that's cool, man. Yeah. Foe, here's it is, it's in a, is in the National Geographic Dna reveals lost relative from 40,000 years ago, Russian researches dug up, uh, a sliver of human finger bone from an isolated Siberian cave. The team stored it away for a later testing, assuming that the nondescript fragment came from one of those neanderthals, uh, who left a, a welter of tools. I don't even know what a welter is and I haven't heard that expression well to alter of tools. So that'd be,

Speaker 5:          02:11:22       yeah.

Speaker 2:          02:11:22       Yeah. Well, no. Have you ever heard of that? What's l w e l t e r welter of tools. And it came between 30 and 48,000 years ago. And nothing about the bones seemed extraordinary, but the genetic material told a different story. When the German researcher is extracted and sequenced the DNA from the fossil, they found that it did not match that of neanderthals or of modern human beings, which were also living nearby at the time. So a new genetic data reveal that the bone may belong to a previously unrecognized extinct human species that migrated out of Africa long before our known relatives. That's all 40,000 years ago, man, there was a different type of fucking human. They went to Russia that was in Russia. In Siberia. Africa. Yup. So Africa sucked back then. Well, people always keep walking, dude. They just keep going. That's just within us. We keep going. I guess maybe people got to California and then they decided to move to Maui. Like this. Just keep on going. They got direct flights to not back then. Just boats. Crazy. Yeah. That wasn't, was that Bolts Beck? That was this 40,000 years ago. Most likely no boats is straight up walking and walking and walking. Yeah, they're starting to fucking backdate boats though. They've uh, they've backdated boats quite a bit. I think they found evidence of a tuna, like oldest evidence of tuna, like way earlier than they ever thought. Oldest,

Speaker 5:          02:12:46       no tuna boat, tuna boat.

Speaker 2:          02:12:51       They're magic. The first dude that make a boat was like, man, I gotta get the Fuck Outta here. I don't even know where to go. Well, they had it. Wow, dude, sweat this. They had boats. They were fishing boats and three 10 a d the earliest known boat was made. It's a 7,000 year old boat found in Kuwait as the earliest known boat, but now they found evidence of deep sea fishing. 42,000 years old, a bolt. This is the newest shit that will, they found evidence of, of a, of tuna bones

Speaker 2:          02:13:28       and tune our deep sea fish. So someone had to out there and get these motherfuckers. The earliest known bolts found in France and the NFL are only 10,000 years old, but archeologists know that they don't tell the whole story. Would in other common boat building materials don't preserve well and the archaeological record and the colonization of Australia and the nearby islands of Southeast Asia, which began at least 45,000 years ago, required sea crossings of at least 30 kilometers. So they know that 45,000 years ago someone had a boat that could go about 60 miles, right? Isn't that what it is? Kilometers. 100 kilometers of 62 miles. I know the opposite. So it's less kilometers. Less than a mile? Correct. Okay, so a little bit. A little bit more miles than that. Like double? Yeah. Hundreds. Yeah. Wow. That's crazy. Yet whether or not these migrants put it, is that how it goes?

Speaker 2:          02:14:24       Cause kilometer and how many kilometers again? How many? 30 kilometers or 30 kilometers. Just 20 miles. Okay. Okay. So it's less miles or less than kilometers, right? Right. Cause a hundred kilometers an hour is 62 miles an hour. All right. Okay. So 30 kilometers, probably 2020 ish miles in a boat. 45,000 years ago. Yet, whether these early migrants put out to sea deliberately in boats or simply drifted from the tides in rafts meant for near shore exploration as a matter of fierce debate. So they at least had that, this is crazy, man. That's crazy that they think people were deep sea fishing 40 fucking thousand years ago. People had to eat. Yeah, but I mean it's amazing. They've found half of the fish in these areas, um, that these people lived in, uh, off Australia 42,000 years ago. Half of the fish they found were a tuna and sharks that live in deep water.

Speaker 2:          02:15:25       They also found a fish hook from a mollusk shell, a mollusk shell, and dated it to 23,000 years ago. That's incredible. People were fucking doing some crazy shit back then, man. People are hungry and they were tired of deer. Yeah. And well cows and like we were saying, man, they just, they keep going. People keep going. They came here for fucking Africa. Even if they, this, these, these dudes that went from Africa all the way to Siberia and then they died there. Was it that hot? It was the heat that did it right. Could be a million, no food competition, no food driven away by predators, driven away by other humans who knows. Mature in a way that fight, we got to keep it. There's a lot in between Africa and Russia. And if they were doing it on foot fucking a man 40,000 years ago, they might've been doing it on foot.

Speaker 2:          02:16:19       It's very possible. They probably might not have even had horses just walking let's shoes. They probably figured out choose right or they might not need them. Leif leaf feet. I Dunno. Have you ever seen that show? Uh, I forget what it was called. Dual survivor or something like that. And there was two dudes and they would go wandering around, surviving in the woods. Like their whole thing was survive. And like they would do a thing like survivor man, but there was two of them was a competition. No, they would just survive. They would just show you how you would create a a house and this is how you go catch fish and this is how you protect yourself from rainstorms. But one dude, everywhere he went, he would go barefoot. His name was Cody. I think Cody, he's got the nastiest feet of all time. He is like thick calluses all over the bottom of like a shoe because he never takes his fucking, he never puts his shoes on. He walks everywhere. So the skin on his feet, it was just hard as a rock,

Speaker 7:          02:17:14       Eh, this is disgusting. Pretty disgusting. Proudly when he comes to people's plays, they asked him to put shoes on.

Speaker 2:          02:17:25       Yeah, they come out, Cody, Cody's coming over your house and give him your slippers. They know he keep him and keep him, man, you got to cover those fucking nasty feet. I eat in this house. I don't know what's flying off of your feet while you're wandering around. That is nasty. There's something particularly offensive about feet. Like someone can have some, you know, you could have dry skin on your forearm and it doesn't really bother people, but if you got some, that's his foot. He's rolling with a rock. Why is he running it with?

Speaker 7:          02:17:53       Is that a callous or like some type of fungus, that white thing. Oh, that's a, what am I looking at? Foot. But no, it's two other things there. It's a big toe. Okay. What does that, that's his toe and his rap. Yeah. I think what he's doing is his polling is tall,

Speaker 2:          02:18:09       rubbing it with a rock to make. I thought the white part, I stopped. That was too much. If I get hard, I'll get scared. I don't know why I made that choice. I'm sure he knows about shoes. It's gotta be a more effective strategy. Marketing. What does stand out to stand out from the other? Gavi, more memorable. Get mentioned on the Joe Rogan podcast. That's a good point, man. It did work out because the other dude, nobody knows who the fuck he is. Yeah. That's so true. Marketing is so important. Like what it was. Everybody know about Einstein's got this fucking crazy hair man. Not just equals MC square. They know what he looked like. It's all wild and Daddy. Yup. Nikola Tesla. No one knows that. That dude looks like nope. Why? Because he was a slick little Croatian dude. Very slim or wear a suit and tie. Look normal. Yeah. Nobody gives a fuck about that guy. Nobody plays Nikola Tesla for Halloween. But people would dress up like Einstein. Everybody knows you're Einstein. Exactly. You're right. Got To get you to look. Have you ever thought about a look like perhaps like maybe something that people will remember? You mean you're talking about a case, a catchphrase for a pig hunting? Maybe. Maybe you need to like, you know, something.

Speaker 7:          02:19:22       What type of outfit or something? Yeah. Uh, get the same outfit time.

Speaker 2:          02:19:28       Nobody ever done that same outfit. Yeah. Like a Bruce Lee outfit. Oh, like a Bruce Lee out? No. Bruce Lee, where that game of death outfit. And if you see anybody in a yellow track suit with black stripes, you automatically think of Bruce Lee. Remember we fought Kareem Abdul Jabbar. He had the track suit. I don't remember if it was, don't remember, dude. I see nursing that tracksuit. Come on.

Speaker 7:          02:19:51       I haven't seen a lot of the essential movies or television. I know has seen Bruce Lee movies. I see it. A couple Gabriel Iglesias as a comic that does that with his shorts. That's a good point. And he has the, he has the in a silhouette of him behind it as part of his stage set. Oh, does he always? Yeah. I always shorts and a Hawaiian shirt or something and always a silhouette. Even when he's at clubs, not a silhouette but like a, like a, that logo will be behind them. And now I'm talking about for specials on TV for a special. Yeah. And probably if he played, he played, he's like, yeah, he was places so probably had some type of set piece or something.

Speaker 2:          02:20:30       He does huge places. Any does clubs too. Like Gabriel, we'll do like a, he'll do like nine shows in a week and do like a 6:00 PM show. He'll do an 8:00 PM show, a 10:00 PM show and a midnight show. Yeah, he's crazy like that. He does a early shows for kids. Like families can come to like a 5:00 PM show when it's light out. Wow. He, I think he holds the record for the most consecutive sellouts at the ice house. Sold out like some insane amount of shows in a row. Like he was there for two weeks in a row, like every day does Monday night shows and shit.

Speaker 7:          02:21:02       I haven't seen him live. I've seen he brings a lot of people with them. Brings like a lot of stand ups. Supports a lot of dudes. Yeah. Just he, he like, you know, supports the, he's a genuinely good guy. Like a, as far as like, I remember, uh, Trevor Noah used to tour with him and he traveled and he gave her, he was like, you gotta get merged man. And so Gabriel got them some certs made up and then Travis said he was killing it on Mertz after shows and shit.

Speaker 2:          02:21:28       Yeah. People love to buy shit. If you've got a catch phrase, that's something Bam, Bam will eating him. Joe Rogan need to make one man. Come on, dude, do it. We'll go. We'll take you pig hunting and when, when you kill a pig, you got to say that. Yeah. That'll be your shit. And then we'll start making tee shirts. Definitely. You don't get high when you hunt. Do you know? I mean, I know people who do. I know a dude who dear Hans. Hi. Yeah. Yeah. He likes it. He's an old hippie. Yah. The smokes. A little weed and cause out there and we ain't don't look like a Hippie, but there's a lot of hippie in him. He loves to take a one hitter, take a blast and then go out and go hunting. She was like, you're more in tune with nature.

Speaker 7:          02:22:13       Yeah. I feel like if I shot an animal high, I freak out. Like, oh no, just taking life. It was was alive now because of my actions. It is alive. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          02:22:26       It pretty common probably. Yeah, but you wouldn't get bummed out if you went and bought a cheeseburger. If I went to in and out. You're so disconnected from the process. Just deliciousness. This is real fast too. Do you think that's a part of human evolution is that there's a reason why we're moving past this whole hunting gathering thing and that in the future that not only will not be necessary, but like we won't even have those desires anymore?

Speaker 7:          02:22:48       No, I think it's, this is a convenience man. People got jobs as shit. We can't be shooting pigs for sure, for sure. But your lifestyle can sustain that. That you know, going out there and waiting for two hours and taking a side, it's good at it and then cutting it and putting it on the grill and doing all that. That is cool. But you know, the reason food is processed, how it is is just because people don't have time to be fucking with that.

Speaker 2:          02:23:16       Absolutely. I mean people with regular jobs absolutely don't have time, but there's also people don't want to be a part of it. Yeah. People are moving away from it and I wonder if that is all a part of the process that's going to lead people to develop artificial food. It's just like food that you get from animals because they've already figured out how to do that. They've already made science. They figured out how to make some sort of an artificial steak and it was unbelievably expensive, like $250,000 or something like that to create this meat that they grew in a test tube or in a laboratory somewhere. But I think that maybe like that's like the first echoes of this sort of cultural shift from, from being hunter gatherers to being able to go to the grocery store too. There's no need to kill an animal because we're going to make artificial meat and everybody would just eat scientifically created meat that's totally nutritious and healthy.

Speaker 2:          02:24:10       They'll fuck it up for a couple of years and some of it will, you know, some people get like some weird crones disease and shit like that from the artificial meat, but then eventually they'll get it down. So it's even more nutritious than like wild game. I don't know if I want to go that route. I don't know either. But I think it's inevitable. Yeah. Yeah, I think so. I think there's a reason why. Um, I think it's the transition. There's a reason why people find hunting. Just tasteful. Even people, some people that eat meat, they don't even want to know how the animal dies. They don't want to be a part of it. They don't want, they certainly don't want to see a video and they definitely don't want to go shoot an animal. Right. So why do they like meat? Like why are they so good? It's delicious, but why are they okay with that? Cause I think there's like, that's like the bridge between us and then the new us, which just figures out how to do everything synthetically just recreate it. Just like they could recreate every, I mean they're going to recreate people for sure. If we stay alive for another thousand years, if human beings are still on this planet, a thousand years from now, we will have artificial humans that are indistinguishable. It'll be some a hundred percent blade runner shit

Speaker 7:          02:25:15       about, yeah, I feel like a thousand years is going to get weird. I kinda, I, I sometimes I think about the future and give bummed out that I won't get to see how crazy

Speaker 5:          02:25:24       it is. You might just based on how it is, the shift has been doing my lifetime. You say I might, you might, it might be so crazy. You might actually get to see 500 years from now.

Speaker 2:          02:25:33       Bullshitting man. The, the, the, if you pay attention to guys like Ray Kurzweil and all these futurists that are at the cusp of technology that really understand the, what innovations are being created, all the different things they have on the pipeline. Yeah. They're getting pretty close to getting pretty clear. They say that the person that's alive today is going to be the first person to live to be 150 years old. Yeah. And they think that that's just today that that person will probably be alive to meet a person lives to be a thousand. I just ended that. I just made that up.

Speaker 5:          02:26:06       Let me see if it is only made up the part about that person will probably be, yeah, but the 150 thing, that's pretty much consensus. 50 I mean that's a lot, but yeah, it feels more feasible cause what is the latest had been 117 hundred 20 something like that or it's hard to tell because it's hard to find out who's telling the truth when they get to be that old. Those are all constantly to fuck a paperwork. Fuck, they ain't got nothing. Nothing to lose. The weight is going to challenge them like, yeah, you do look, oh, his foot. We believed you. What's the point? Society needs this story. Anyway. Yeah. Who is, let's take a guess. I'm going to say 122 years old. Oh, the Otis and I think is one 17 one 18 is the oldest person. Let's find out right now. Oldest person ever was 116 years old, oldest living person. The oldest ever was 122 oh wow. Yeah. She's from France. What about the, what about those Bible folks? Oh, the 600 year old know. What about those folks? Well, I think their calendars with dog shit back then. They will talk about weeks. Calendars. We've written down stones. Happy Birthday is Monday. Yeah. The idea that those people lived 600 years. That's Hilarious, but what if, what if back then what was going on is they were super technologically advanced and then the flood came along. They had to start from scratch. It would have no, really was

Speaker 2:          02:27:33       600 years old because no was a part of an ancient civilization that was far more advanced. That's why God got pissed. These motherfuckers, these dummies are living to be 600 years old. All right. Fuck this. I'm just going to start with Noah. I'm just going to know. You seem like a good guy, but yeah. Well it's ridiculous. It's also ridiculous that we are the children of Noah's incest.

Speaker 5:          02:27:56       Yeah. Was it? No. Was it assessed? Who else is who,

Speaker 2:          02:27:59       who fucks? I mean, how many people were left? It's no one. How many people? His family, right?

Speaker 5:          02:28:03       Oh, you mean, oh, you mean? Yeah, his incest. Uh, yeah.

Speaker 2:          02:28:06       I mean he didn't bring her on a bunch of hot Swedish chicks for excellent genetic material on the shoot loads and to all of them, he, even if he did just that small gene pool, have no abroad over 50 people and just fuck those 50 chicks. It was just him in 50 checks. The whole human race would be a mess. The whole human race. It's all crazy. Interbreeding or that w would take generations to fucking fix all that shit,

Speaker 7:          02:28:29       right? Yeah. Yes. Nah, I'm not a, that stuff is all goofy.

Speaker 2:          02:28:35       It's goofy stuff is definitely goofy. But, uh, uh, there, there still is this people to this day, it's still believe it have giant, a giant percentage

Speaker 7:          02:28:44       giant. That's 100%. It's very passionate about it. So it's a, I try not to get into it with those types. What do you know? I mean, I don't, I don't, I'm never in situations where I'm talking with a religious person or debate. I talk about it and my stand up a little bit and uh, pretty much that's it. But it is, it does baffle me a little bit. When people get mad on Twitter,

Speaker 2:          02:29:04       the world's go up to the Muslims. You always go on after us Christians, first of all, because Muslims are a more dangerous target. Dummy pretending it. And second of all, because you're right here, you're right here, right here in America, land of the free home. They believe in zombies. Family as Christa's. Yeah. More relatable. I grew up Christian. So is this a different yeah. Yeah. This is, uh, this is also a much more ridiculous place to get hoodwinked. You know, we're not living in some backwards fucking crazy culture that's run by some, well, sort of are, but not as much. So as these ancient cultures, there's cultures that have been, you know, they're, they're, they have a lot of their ideas about what people shouldn't, shouldn't do, or thousands of years old. They just stuck him. Right.

Speaker 7:          02:29:51       Yeah. This is really weird that I talk about people getting the Holy Ghost sometimes. You all, that's great. I love that the Pentecostals and a baptist, when people just like

Speaker 2:          02:30:04       really

Speaker 7:          02:30:05       that are you doing that is that, that it makes you feel like that the Lord makes you, Dan speaking in tongues, speaking in tongues. Is that you did you, did you just want to do that and use this hat, this excuse using religion as an excuse. Like I used to speak at what does, is this, that s that's confusing when it's just when they were living in turns into a reason for people to just act out and be weird publicly. I like when they do it on TV. You ever see Robert Tilden? You know, that guy is uh, probably by face if he's a, if he's a religious dude, he's one of the most ridiculous all time dudes. But uh, he, he would like in the middle of it broadcast

Speaker 2:          02:30:43       hosts. So solar, Macula, it just totally, completely obviously fake language. And he was making it up on the spot. Very repetitive. Very unlike a real language. It varies and tone and, and sounds and creative with some alarm keeps repeating the same sounds over and over again. Stinks. Because I can understand. I understand the structure of it as him. Is he speaking in tongues here? We'll also

Speaker 5:          02:31:20       provide and multiply. That's the opening of the windows of heaven. This is, oh, this is the farming preacher video. Yeah. I want to hear him talking in tongues. Yeah. They putting fart sounds while he's, it's very juvenile. Youtube is free.

Speaker 7:          02:31:35       There is, yeah. I'm gonna take this preacher fart sounds. Gunshot noises. You know what this needs, I'm until a super cut of

Speaker 5:          02:31:43       this, but I'm gonna put this song over it so it looks like he's singing to this. You know what else? The Internet figured out that uh, people outside the Internet ever figured out memes. Those memes. Yeah. Pictures like a picture, a picture of you. Bam, Bam. We're eating ham. I mean that's without a doubt someone has made that. It's already happening without a doubt. I'll go to my message board right now and I guarantee fucking tee you. There is a photo up on my message board that says Bam, Bam, we're eating ham and it shows you and if not you cause times phrase both of us. You, you said it man,

Speaker 7:          02:32:22       but I'm not a hunting. I don't need it man. I'm

Speaker 5:          02:32:24       it. I ghost write sometimes and he said it. You said it. It's up there man. Without a doubt. I guarantee you it's up there. It was not up there. By the end of this broadcast, someone will at least be working on it. That's the beauty of the Internet. It is crazy. Oh, it's the greatest thing ever, man. We're so lucky as comics to to, to be able to release specialists and shit in this time. Yeah. Like your special is going to be on comedy central Air Saturday night. Yeah. But it also, you could get it online right now. Right. Right. Foot up. People that don't want to wait, they want to go get that shit by the way. Get it. And can you play it on iPads and everything? It's everything. Yeah. You can play it on your phone. Everything. I think phone also. Yes. Beautiful. That's beautiful. Yeah. See, look at that. This is a beautiful time for, for standup distribution. Instant access where we could say, hey man, Hannibal's a funny motherfucker. You need to go see live from Chicago. Boom. Someone to go online and at the end of my sentence, they're already in. They're already clicking in and yeah, it's incredible. Is a good sign. Yeah. Making it out. Boom.

Speaker 7:          02:33:30       And that's the, that's what the Amazon one click. The beautiful, the beauty is of Twitter and things like that too, is I find out about new music. I'll find out about news and different things. Or if I'm in New York, you know, I might just search. If I am, I'll search. Oh, the city that I'm in, I just started this city events and I'll find out this person is playing a concert. I didn't even know what they have planned, a concert, but I found out about it through Twitter or just saying, hey, what's the best restaurant here in Denver? You have people give you restaurant suggestions and then you'd go and [inaudible] is great. So that's the, that's the beauty of a, of Twitter and the immediacy of the Internet is that access and just having that information and being able to use it.

Speaker 5:          02:34:13       Fuck yeah. Um, I use, uh, because I'm, I use an android phone. I use

Speaker 2:          02:34:18       Amazon. Yeah. And so, uh, I use Amazon for, for music, for comedy, for anything. And I was coming home from, uh, the Improv in Irvine and I said, I need to hear some fucking new comedy. I'm like, everybody keeps telling you this. Hannibal Burress motherfuckers funny, let me go check it out. So I got this, I got animal furnace, dude, it's fucking bad ass. And I got it within 10 minutes, within 10 minutes, I had it on my, on my knee. I mean, not even, I was driving and I was playing it within like 30 seconds. Right. And the whole thing was downloaded within a couple of minutes just on, I only had three g at the time. I couldn't even get four g and boom, it's on your phone and you're listening while you're driving. It's amazing.

Speaker 7:          02:34:57       Ed is good to like issues with fas. Like I had one where a specialist Chicago, some of this, but yeah, when I shot the special, uh, the ticket price was kind of low, so it got scalped Kinda have you got scalped and scalp was well in lies. I mean people writing me saying, uh, I want to come to your show, but you know, fuck it, I'm paying $200 for this scalper and I was like, fuck that. They'll pay 200 bucks. You can donate to this charity, mercy home and screen screen cap, uh, a a screencap to receipt showing that you donate it and I'll put you on my guest list. You know what I mean? But that's just through Twitter. Twitter, I just be, I just have angry fans. Ryan's got, it was probably still this angry fans by scalped tickets, but I was able to at least in a couple situations with shows up, it's sold out or shows the biggest scout. I'm able to put somebody on my guest list just cause they, if they donate to that charity, that's beautiful. What's the charity with mercy home and what is mercy home Diversey in Chicago is this helps, uh, you know, young black kids to Chicago, just a w programs and says educates and after school programs and things like that.

Speaker 2:          02:36:06       That's amazing, man. That's a great idea. That's a really great idea. You are you from Chicago? From Chicago because Ari Shaffir went, we were in Chicago. Ariana,

Speaker 7:          02:36:15       y'all went near town. It's the same, yeah. UFC what's happened?

Speaker 2:          02:36:18       Yeah, we did the Chicago theater Friday night and then already went and go, went and checked you out. Was it Friday night or Saturday night? It was Saturday on that shot. Yeah. So he went and checked you out I think after the fights were over. Yeah. Yeah. I think he went there right after the fights were over and checked out your special, yeah. That's cool man. Where'd you play in Chicago to visit? So that was this show. That was this show. Oh, so this is fresh, man. This is fresh out of the box. It's only a couple of months ago. We turned it over fast. Fast. Was that, when was it as a two area filled? January 25th wow. Damn, that's perfect though. That way you get there. There'll probably be some jokes on TV if they're topical. Like do you have anything topical that like, is that still applicable today?

Speaker 7:          02:37:01       Uh, nothing really topic. Let's talk about music a little bit. Current music and things like that, but nothing political but the beach boys. What's up the things to the beach boys

Speaker 2:          02:37:11       a lot. These fucking monkeys and Duran Duran, they're so weird.

Speaker 7:          02:37:16       They always Duran Duran and

Speaker 5:          02:37:20       too sexy. The too, there's something about him. I don't like how symmetrical they are. Yeah. It's what I always appreciated about Keith Richards and Mick Jagger. They're kind of ugly to kind of fucked up login. I liked my music to come out of some people that live in the experience of pain. Yeah. Bam, Bam, Wheaton.

Speaker 7:          02:37:37       It's impossible to avoid. Gives us no first the right pitch for it. It's a great picture. It's the right picture for it. You're smiling with your TV, teeth, your eyes, Davey tape.

Speaker 5:          02:37:49       Um, so, uh, besides your special, uh, where else can people find your tour dates?

Speaker 7:          02:37:54       It's turned, I saw my website is Hannibal buress.com. Um, I think, yeah. Yeah. I only got a few days coming up while I try to get this new shit together.

Speaker 5:          02:38:03       Yeah. Oh, that's right man. That's the thing, right? Yeah. You got to abandon the old and come up.

Speaker 7:          02:38:08       Let's Amanda. No, they'll go half and half a sub. So I'm working on it, but yeah, it Hannibal Buress Dotcom and I'm in a, you know, on, at the knitting factory in Brooklyn on Sundays. Every Sunday. Every Sunday if a less amount of role. But this Sunday coming up I'm hosting. Oh, that's right.

Speaker 5:          02:38:23       Cool. So you host dare, like, like you were talking about doing shows where the, you bring up your friends is that we,

Speaker 7:          02:38:28       yeah. Bring a friends and have musical guests. Like, cause we have a, we have a rent. It's the front barn and we had a main room that holds about 300 so that's what I have a couple of musical guests. Oh, that's awesome. That's a great idea. So yes, just act Bridget Everett this song. That's amazing. Have you seen Bridget Everett? No, no, no. He's just like just sorta comedy, Cabaret Sing and act. But like gets the crazy reaction from the crowd. People split when they see it. What would sort of, what's a unique about it is just really good. Really good. She's a good, she's a great singer, but then she also interacts with the crowd in a way where she'll just put a random crowd members face into her titties was in the middle of a song and she'll ride or walk around. It's a, it's a crazy, just is perfect live at I guess what of those acts two where it's alive and well, you could watch it on, you might have videos up, you could watch it and be like, oh, that's cool. But you see her live, it's like, oh, the shit watching people watch is I like to watch out of the, you know, you see people's reaction. I'm has some cats that only come and usually see standard with my show, but they are watching her like, what the fuck is going on? But she's uh, eh, she was real good. Uh, and then got Michael Che on that show right there. Yeah. Yes. All right there. Let me hear some of this.

Speaker 10:         02:39:57       Wow. What an aggressive woman. Not a man. Can't handle that handle. A lot of men get confused. A woman like that. Oh, that's hilarious. She's finds an audience dude and sits in his lap and she's sweating all over. And I bet that chick sweats a lot. That's hilarious.

Speaker 2:          02:40:19       So you do this every Sunday. His show is every Sunday. Whether I'm that. Yeah. What made you decide to start doing something like that? How did you get that started?

Speaker 7:          02:40:26       It was when it was an old nine. Uh, I had just started writing for Saturday night live and I did the opening night at the native factor. It used to be in downtown Manhattan and it moved to Williamsburg, Brooklyn. I did open night opening night there, opening for this band, the savvy five. And then they uh, the, the management, they said we want to do a comedy night. And so at the time I was writing it Saturday night laughs. So my only open night was a Sunday nights. So I just started doing it and it, and it's built over time with built an audience. Like it used to be, you know, patsy yard, he's like, you know, it gets 20 people here at 30 feet, but it's now it's packed all the time. And a lot of people drop in and Louie's been through. Chris rock comes through a little bit. Chappelle's been through was Amy Schumer cubs, like a lot of people come through to work out. It's a savvy crowds is high energy and it's a lot of fun. That's what I try out my new shit. And this is kind of my, it's two blocks from my place, which is very convenient.

Speaker 2:          02:41:20       Oh Wow. So you can walk to work,

Speaker 7:          02:41:22       walks out at nine o'clock show. Sometimes I'm in the shower at eight 50

Speaker 2:          02:41:26       now. You told people though, but this is the problem. Now that freaks are going to get near that area and scan out in a two block grid and try to figure out where we're Hannibal lives. I'm moving in.

Speaker 7:          02:41:38       Oh, started to going hunting. Shrimps.

Speaker 2:          02:41:43       I like the idea. You hosted a show too. That's a great idea man. That's what I'm in Boston. That's what they used to do. They used to have like the Steve Sweeney show, like the Boston headliners and that guy would host and he would bring up all these other comedians.

Speaker 7:          02:41:56       Fun. It's a way for me to kind of stay, you know? Cause if you, once you headline and you just go on the road, it's easy to kind of get out of touch with who you know. So out. It'd be comics that only been doing it for a year on the same show with you know, Chris rock or somebody. So it's good to just see everybody and just, you know, and just, you know, I still like the, the, the structure of putting together a show, just knowing I should have this person on earlier and that a flow good and to dance and this person should go second half cause that. So I still, I book it myself and everything. So it's, it's, it's a lot of fun. It's a good spot to just always, always try new stuff there every week. And it's a fun time.

Speaker 2:          02:42:38       Yeah, we do that out here at the Ice House in Pasadena. If you ever around man, we do a lot of like Wednesday night shows. If you ever hear on a Wednesday night and the same thing I'll, it'll be me and I'll bring along like Brian Cowan are, you should fear Dunkin Joey deals look good. Like all these different guys do it. And having that same sort of situation where you're trying to figure out who should go on after him and put him here and it's fun. Yeah.

Speaker 7:          02:43:02       What, it works out the right way and you're like, oh, that feels, it just feels good. It kind of producing something all the time and just, you know, figuring out what, Yay. Who we was like, what comics was the audience we were spying on what comics to, obviously we're a sponsor of that kind of thing. This is real cool.

Speaker 2:          02:43:19       Yeah. Like what you're doing too though. You're adding know the musical element to it too. That's a great idea.

Speaker 7:          02:43:23       Yeah. The music album, it's just good for energy and it's just, it's just mixing it up and makes it more of a old school. So lately I've been having kind of raw rappers and musicians open, open for me on the road in addition to having a comedian. I have one comedian. Yeah. I mean doing Largo tonight. And uh, this cat, he just got done to cat. It was amazing. Uh, singer and basis, he's performing. And so it's just been real. It's just a different vibe. And this adds another element to the show. Also. I just want, I like giving people, I get, I get just cause my ticket prices just started to go up, so I feel nervous. So I want to give people as much as a so as possible. So I'm like, I got to have a musician, I have a DJ with me.

Speaker 7:          02:44:04       Like, cause I do musical stuff doing my set. When I talk about different rap songs to DJ or cue it up. I got, I do a song at the end, ballerinas come out outside of that. Do people pay 30 bucks? I'm trying to do it up. So, uh, yeah, I enjoyed it. Is trying to, you know, you know, introduce people to introduce audiences to new people and also just a freak out. Just how to put on just a real a show that people want to come back to it. Like it's all about making people want to talk about it. And when I come back to this city wanting to come again,

Speaker 2:          02:44:36       well you're doing it because I keep hearing. Great. Thanks man. I keep hearing great things. Thanks man. And I've, uh, I've only done one show everywhere. I had music. There was a Joey Diaz, me and Doug, Stan hope and honey honey, this band that's a, they're actually going to be here tomorrow. Um, and we, uh, we all did this, uh, show, uh, at the Wiltern in La on December 21st, 2012 because it was supposed to be the end of the world. Yeah. Yeah. That was when the mines, all the fucking freaky people were thinking that. It was, it was a awesome night. It was an awesome night, but it was the only time I've ever been fired. Oh, it's fucking beautiful show. I wore a suit and everything. I never wear a suit. I wore slick clothes. Felt odd, but I liked it, but it felt good. Like, you know, it was fun to do like a big show to musical guests. I got to do more of those.

Speaker 7:          02:45:24       Yeah. It's just adds a acid, another energy to it. Especially if the crowd is, is that they go about doing it is just making sure that the music economy could work as long as people are a little bit, it could work as a surprise, but when people I built it makes it better, especially for the comedian opening for a band and you walk out as a comedian for a band and they don't know that you're covered, I guess is the word I years ago open for this band unfree Mcgee's uh, and we, it was, I took the Gig was in Dekalb, Illinois. It was about our outside, Chicago's what? Northern Illinois University is one of the band. They saw me as xannies in Chicago Comedy Club and they asked me to open for them and so it was at, I think they were on at nine and then at 45 they tell me to go and the lights go down.

Speaker 7:          02:46:13       And so there's been no announcement that I'm going on. It's just the lights went down and then I walk out. Crowd is like right away. Like no, like they just started yelling and it's not even the real showtime yet. I'm up 15 minutes before the actual start time. I was the only open it but people were just so agitated because they didn't want to see a comedian. They they you know, bought these tickets probably months ago and then some comedian they never heard of is walking out so but it just helps with just the audience. So all of the [inaudible] cause they didn't know either. The band is just trying to put me in a good spot. They were like, we like this dude, he used to be on the show and now I'm known from doing shows that situation like that all it takes is for somebody from the bands, either side stays on the mic or even come out and say, hey we are going to be out in a little bit. We got this commedia we like check them out we think is funny. And then that settles everything down because now that gives me credibility. So it's just about the audience, knowing what's going on and then that that makes everything work easier.

Speaker 2:          02:47:17       When I bring people on the road with me, I always introduce them from the SAS. I always say thank you everybody for coming out. Yeah. Yell out and just get everybody hyped up and let them know. Like, I'm sure I'm bringing this comedian because I think he's hilarious. I want you to see good shit.

Speaker 7:          02:47:31       Yeah. Some cats, the people have open floor. I've done that flow besides days like Dimitri done that Aziz, uh, Louis, it just helps subside GAF. Like it just helps it, uh, especially as, I mean, your crowds might be a little bit more aggressive to some mothers. No, they're nice. They're nice, but you don't show sometime man. It'll still show some, let's do a show. That's awesome, man.

Speaker 2:          02:47:55       Yeah. Um, I opened up for Bon Jovi once. Yeah. I was in a theater in the round in, I think it was in queens and it was, I'm a long time ago. Yeah, it was two. It was ridiculous. I was, first of all, I wasn't that good. I had only been doing comedy for like four years and a second. Second of all, it was they didn't want to see a comedian, you know, it just was a terrible idea. The whole idea was awful. And I'm standing on this fucking stage surrounded by like a drum set and guitar. I can't move. I didn't know where to stand. It was a,

Speaker 7:          02:48:28       Oh was the, was the uh, what are the people like the rodeo 80 by was there moving around fixing shit behind you. 100% subsides and music gets with it. Comedians out data respect that it's still fixing the sound. They might even bang on the drums a little bit. Check the guitar, no doubt. Check things, check the drums, don't give a fuck. They don't care about you. They just like I'm done. I'm trying to do my job the best way possible. It's fuck you and your up.

Speaker 2:          02:48:58       Yeah. It was just bizarre man. It was just bizarre being on a stage when nobody wants you to be doing comedy. Like they want you to go out there and do comedy for people who didn't want to come see comedy. There's a totally different mindset going to see Bon Jovi and some unknown shithead tell bad jokes. Yeah. Waiting for Bon Jovi. They also wanted me to like work the crowd. Like they wanted me to bring women up towards the front. They wanted me to grab the most attractive women and ask them to come towards the front. They wanted to like sort of engineer the front in the middle of your bombing. Exactly. The middle of me eating Dick and, and there wasn't that many attractive women in the first place. It was like picking the ones who were attractive was, it wasn't the best job. So were you able to do that at all? I did something. I mean it was a long time ago. It was a disaster, whatever it was. I remember getting out of there going, okay, now I know what it's like to open up for our band. Fuck that. And that was a nice crowd as far as like bands go, that's a nice crowd. I just was terrible. I shouldn't have been doing it.

Speaker 7:          02:50:01       I've had gigs with, there's isn't that, I've done gigs recently. Over the past year would have been horrible gigs with music, but I just bailed early. Like if I could feel it in the first couple of jokes, like, all right, this is the fun. Y'all have a good one. I we you still doing it? Like somebody called you up today and asked you to open up for a band. Would you still do it? It depends on the band. If I'm, I won't do it. It had to be a favor and just something, if it was a charity thing or if the money's right, like I, I, I'm not just going to turn down a gig because of it being for a band. It has to be, yeah. I have to ask some questions.

Speaker 2:          02:50:40       Well, it's getting also as a point where people know who you are too, so they come see you and the band they expect you and the band. That's part of the hope program. That makes a lot more sense then.

Speaker 7:          02:50:50       Yeah, just me kind of flounder and in front of it. But I think it's, and it's, it's been two or three gigs where I just said, you know what, I'm Outta here. Y'All caught me. Like my name was Hannibal Burress see how later. Like I would even good because this is like, you know what the Gig wasn't. It wasn't right, but I don't, I know it. There's no bearing on what I could do. It just wasn't the right situation. Did you ever see the one with Charlie Murphy, uh, toward the checkup? He didn't really say that checkout well, he didn't. He didn't. I don't think he, I do know for sure. I think I remember look at it up more. I think he kept that check and I was a show. I don't know. I know, I know Charlie, he's kind of crazy. He to definitely tear up a chalk, especially if you had money and he's got money to tear up a chart and tell you, go fuck yourself. It's got a lot of character. Well, Scott, balls of steel. I'm the type of dude I tear up a check and then have my agent asked, but a wire on second thought, can you sit in that to this routing number, please? Yeah. That's probably the more intelligent way of doing it. It's fake. Just tear up a piece of paper fucking checks. Why? Think about your money.

Speaker 7:          02:52:03       Yeah, a symbolic check.

Speaker 5:          02:52:06       Yeah. Hannibal, you're funny, mother fucker. Thank you very much for having me. This was, this was real cool. I enjoyed it very much, man. Okay.
