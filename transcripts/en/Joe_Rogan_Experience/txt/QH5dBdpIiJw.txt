And should they, I can see after all this process of evolutionary process in the MMA and the martial arts world, I mean, since then I've been watching you doing your job, do command in fights, analyzing other fighters and should, they can see man, you a red belt and the whole in the whole extension of the word, you know everything you mean.

Speaker 2:          00:05:07       Thank you brother. That's an honor to me. And uh, it was an honor for me to hang out with you that night. It was really cool for a, we had dinner with your family and then we watch some fights. Yeah. And it was really interesting watching fights with you and watching you breakdown positions and breakdown the mistakes that people were making. And I've told a lot of people about that, man. I'm throwing a lot of people about that night. That documentary a choke. Uh, that is one document that I've told people, if you really interested in Jujitsu, you really want to find out, you know what, what the spirit of Jujitsu is all about. Watch the documentary choke that documentary. So inspirational. They followed you, was it in 94? 95?

Speaker 3:          00:05:45       Yeah. 95. [inaudible] 96

Speaker 2:          00:05:47       [inaudible] 95 going [inaudible] 96 and you were fighting in Japan, in the Japan valley to doe and it documented a lot of your training and documented your philosophy and man, whenever I, if I ever need some, I'll slap

Speaker 1:          00:05:58       that DVD on. He just get fired up. You wanted to go see and do some yoga on the beach or something? Yeah, no, it's fine. How did that come about? What? That documentary, Oh, was it

Speaker 3:          00:06:07       project we fight student of mine who was working with the polygraph and also, uh, cop. So he decided, we decided to follow up to the event. And so we, we, they have a crew following couple of fighters and a and uh, follow myself to see what's going to happen at the event. So it was a, a nice, uh, introduction to a preparation to the mindset of a fighter, either myself or the Todd Haynes. What's another, and also the Japanese guy who was also involved from the filming. So it was a cool Brian will experience tool to an MMA fight. Like I've only to the fight.

Speaker 1:          00:06:51       Well, it's very eye opening for a lot of fighters who looked at mixed martial arts. A lot of them come from a wrestling background and they looked at mixed martial arts, more of like as a sport just beat tough, you know, you gotta get up, you've got to train hard, you got to run hard, you gotta live hard and your philosophy was much more like a Samurai. Your philosophy was much deeper, much more meditation base. And we got to see you doing yoga. You, you, I think you opened up a lot of people's eyes to a different mindset involved in preparation, but also to yoga. That was the first time I'd ever seen a martial artist that was really into yoga.

Speaker 3:          00:07:29       Yes. I think, uh, for the athlete in general, the breathing and the understanding of the breathing is a big plus because he stretch or your, I mean by hyperventilate you stretch or physical potential by know how to breathe properly. You relax, you can bring your heart beats. Lower is a lot of elements in the breathing who are involved. We've controlling emotions, getting more energy and so on. So as I get exposed to Brett to breathing properly, I get addicted and I felt like was a huge, uh, element of, you know, too. In addition to the techniques, in addition to the heart, into the heart training, learning the breathing is, is a huge beneficial thing for the athlete. Now you see athletes, like tennis players, they,

Speaker 1:          00:08:20       Oh hey, they play in breathing and the breathing, the breath is much more,

Speaker 3:          00:08:25       do they support you? They, so it's a process of knowing now I see grown, my son, he's, I'm in before. He's just like, see all that. I see you training and Brita. But now he's coming to me and said that this make all the difference in the ward when I really, you know, start, you're getting tired to make hyperventilation and keep my, in my mind like sharp because sometimes you should get tired. Uh, the is not enough oxygen in the blood to fuel your, your sharpness in your mind. So you become a little, uh, stupid, a little slower, you know? So by having a good, knowing how to hyperventilate, you able to, to maximize this, this oxygen you. So even though the acid electric take over your body, your mind is too sharp and you're still responding accordingly. So it's a great thing to do.

Speaker 3:          00:09:14       And you were born into the greatest Jujitsu family, the greatest martial arts family of all time. I mean, there's no doubt about it. There's no, there's not even a second place. There's the Gracie family and then there's, you know, there's the, I guess you could have a debate about who comes in second, but it's kind of ridiculous that that is the number one martial arts family of all time. And you obviously learn Jujitsu from a very early age, but how did you get involved into the yoga? Always, you know, uh, was, I'm very happy to, to be related with this master call learned to Connie, which was the precursor of the [inaudible]. I was learning at the same time over the homeowner who is the guy who is now making the tapes we learning together, you know. And um, at that point, um, it was just practic scene with him.

Speaker 3:          00:10:06       Like he loaned my, my father, he's a older guy who's a very tough athlete and also a yoga teacher. So he combined, he developed some kind of style of yoga, which is not exactly a postural black postures and breathing to relax or to achieve meditation was more like a, an active breeding for athletes. And, and are there for you to jump higher. You have to know how to, to have arm when you, between your, your jump in your breathing. You want to keep Marty strength for more long time. You have to know how to breed a quarterly chew to promote that. So he has always, he always in the active active breathing and then we kind of, we started doing privates and I was in his place for, you know, for a couple of months, his guiding me through the, the moves in front of a mirror in a nice room one day.

Speaker 3:          00:10:59       Um, we about to start the class and sooner he's about to start. Uh, he, he was calling the phone and he said to me, Hixon you keep going and I'll be right back. So for the first time I was able to breed, make my routine without follow him up without having my mind focus in what he was doing. So I start to breathe and move and breathe and move, and then has some woods on the walls, kind of. We cannot imitate monkeys to climb the wooed and stuff. So in one point I come back to reality and then I was on top of the highest frame in the wall sweating like a pig. And then I look around and start to come back to reality and I saw him on the corner crying and then I, what's up man? What's going on? He said, man, you don't have to learn anything else from me.

Speaker 3:          00:11:58       You achieve the highest level of Gut, get empty mine. And then I kinda said, why? I say that said Yeah because you here for an hour, 50 minutes in, completely off. I mean you didn't notice anything because he was applying did development of the animal instinct, which takes your brain off, you're in your mind, your your concentration and keep you more like a instinctive anymore. And that's was the vision in through this. Because before that I was doing transcendental meditation. I did traditional yoga and and those never did great for me in the meditation. I was sleeping and it's not, by doing that kind of routine, I W I was able to not just breathing properly but also achieve empty mine. And I was like in a state of meditation, Meditation State, uh, for a long time, like not concentrating in anything like rational, oh, he's there or he's, so I was able to get a achieve like, uh, I empty mine.

Speaker 3:          00:13:04       And after I noticed that I start to practice my routines to, to get that same feeling of emptiness. And that kind of meditation works for me as no, no other one. And I felt like being an empty mine increases my, my, I don't know, my, my intuition increases my, my sense of, of energy and so was incredible for me because I could get in touch more comfortably with my, I mean, my third vision, I don't know exactly explained, but I could achieve a completely peace of mine in that kind of routine. So I was stick for life.

Speaker 2:          00:13:45       So you just got into this state and you could just exist. No conscious thought, no thinking about anything around you and no past, no future. Just exist is in our moment as act with no context. Yes.

Speaker 3:          00:13:57       That's a kind of a weird positive feeling because you capable to be present in a sense which, uh, if you have your mind set, if you have something expectations or you never there. So I was able to, to, to be very confident very easily to get into that situation where even prior to the fight I'm able to sleep on the, on the locker room, making my workout, getting a high, very high heartbeat. And then like five minutes before I make my praise, I make my meditation and I kind of cool off my heartbeat to 60 60 heartbeats a minute. So I was able to engage very hot and with the hard, very hard, low heartbeat. And as the fight progress, the pace is very hard. If I'm 60 he is 80 when I'm, he's a Honda Day. When I'm a Honda, he's 120 when I'm 120 he's a 45th so when he started to re have to regroup, I was still having to go forward.

Speaker 3:          00:15:02       So at that point my opponents always lose a little B. He is bay. So I ended up time for me to make the, the, the kill, you know, so it was always working properly for me. They re the breathing was always working very well. So this empty mind state enhanced your Jujitsu, this ability to achieve this state on top of all the techniques on top of all the training and the instincts. This took it to the next level? Yes, because you know in one point if you allowed yourself to be present, you're not commit to the office or the defense, you commit, you give nothing and take everything. So you give me opportunity that will be there. If you try to be surprise me, I will be there a quarterly defending myself. So he's all on the table is like no surprises because he's no expectations.

Speaker 3:          00:15:50       So keeping a coal mine, even when it's boiling is something I felt like was always like a something which gives me an edge because I was there just to either catch what is there or resolved the problem. Never disappointed or never a late, no expectation. Yeah. And he's always late. I mean, sometimes we get late because you plan something in the fight and it doesn't happen. So we've well is you start to be disappointed. So for me it was always like whatever happened, I'm there, I'm happy, comfortable finding comfortable finding the sharpness to, to achieve success, you know? So letting great, you grew up in this Jujitsu family, but you were always, at least from most people's interpretation, you were always the best guy out of the family. How did that happen? How did you rise above all the rest? I mean you grew up with a bunch of killers.

Speaker 3:          00:16:45       Yes, everybody's trainee hired. Everybody was pushing through the maximum. And um, for one point I feel like I'm as dedicated and for perfectionist, I'm competitive in my heart, but some elements I get was more like a god. A God gift is not exactly something I choose. So we training the same, why my brother, I can play with my blood brothers and they cannot have a chance with me. So that's kind of hard to explain. It's not me trying to do this. This just happened is my, is my self being, trying to be my best, plus the emotional control, the peace of mind. It was all, you know, for example, my love, my, my beloved brother Heuler, he's a great fighter with sometimes we get too emotional, you know, and that's kind of times makes him choose the home, the wrong path. So hoists he's a, you know, great fighter, but sometimes

Speaker 4:          00:17:50       he, he get a little confused. He's not having the sharp offensive attitude or so sometimes something sleep, um, you know, and so on. So I not exactly know why I'm, I'm the one, I just have to represent and be, you know, happy to be the one. And I tell him, man, all the opportunities, I have to represent ideas already. So I feel like completely comfortable in myself saying, okay, I have nothing to prove to myself. I did all. And uh, you know, I'm very happy with the results. So, Jujitsu for life, for life. Your brother that's not on Jamie, sorry.

Speaker 4:          00:18:40       You're, uh, you had a cousin holes, Gracie. This legendary holds Gracie who was actually, halls is in the DNA. He's Mike. My cousin, but he was leaving in my house, CSI born because my uncle as he, he's, he divorced from his wife. He hauls mother, he give, my father was just get married so he give Hollis to, to be care to my father and mother. So he was like your brother. So he's my older brother because hard and come in just after and then Helson and then when I born like eight 30 or nine years later, I was the little one living with halls, harden and house and for, for, you know, so he's, my brother is no way to see him differently. He was known as a guy who went all over the world, studied sambo, studied at some catch wrestling and the wrestlers and he would bring that back, right?

Speaker 4:          00:19:40       Yes. What would you credit holes in, in bringing leg locks into Brazilian Jujitsu? Is he the one? Yes, I'm in the leg locks. He specifically, uh, it was not something I, I kind of get the, the major information from hose was funny one day. Eric Paulson was a good student and a very good friend. He brought a tape for me from Japan. We've, uh, we've, uh, short too short the wrestling and I saw that the new locks in the short, the wrestle, you know, some guys fighting. And I, I saw and I kind of interesting. And then next day I start to apply it. And then, uh, it was funny because he come to me afterwards, said Hixon you mean I give her that tape one day, next day we're so meeting everybody on the knee locks. So, Oh really? Yeah, it was a, you, you would say you learn more leg locks from Eric Paulson's tape then holes yet, I mean halls, it was not specifically I lead luck guy.

Speaker 4:          00:20:44       You know, there's a picture of him with a Samba shirt on. Look, he studied, he was a master of sound boat cause we, we go in assemble as we go and any other we go in represent these use you'd sue against symbol, you know, and um, independent American games. We went in San Diego, um, was like, uh, a very interesting because it, the fighters, they don't expect so much submissions and we start immediately because duff rassler's stuff, judo players. So we started to meet at the, bringing the fight to the gown ground in goal, four foot locks in knee locks. And immediately, I mean in the first qualification phase they statute tapping a lot and then the referees statue becomes kind of a little scap goes about that the statute become one. So one's halls grab them and then the foot lock, especially in the, in the final match in his way division, he get the gun to foot lock and the we did the referee stopped the fight and say, no, you cannot get the food luck on the joint.

Speaker 4:          00:21:45       You have to get on like on the shin. And then it's kind of confusing, you know, and, and cutting the, that's why halls lost the finals in this event. And um, this is what in the 70s was a, I think eighties 81 or 80. So they just, they were trying to cut him out by the referees stature getting upset because like, what's funny, we suppose to come in with a team from Brazil of 12 guys and we spell expecting like I support from the government and then the governor at that very less, very less moment didn't, didn't give to us. So my father page was to come. So just me, Carlos, Gracie Jr and halls. So we come in to compete in this event. And how old were you at this time? He must've been like 18 or something. Yes. 19 something like that. And then, uh, we coming and I was in the, like my way division, which is one above halls and halls was below me and Carlos was on top of me.

Speaker 4:          00:22:47       So we kind of having one in each division and as the competition progress, the referees, the statue, see those three guys from Brazil just submitting everybody because in sambal chokes are not allowed. No headlocks no, no collar chokes. He's only knee locks, foot locks or straight on bars. CanNot even do the Americans because it goes into, so we just go in trying to do foot locks because those are the easiest way. So we start to finish the guys and they started to say, God, this guy's coming and do food. And everybody me complain, I don't know if it's som both though isn't sambal. Yeah, that's what they do is footlocker. It's now now back then there wasn't fun. It's, it's, it's so interesting how enema that's changed now. It was legal. What was not used especially in December when in the American concepts Russia maybe.

Speaker 4:          00:23:35       Yeah. You know what American Samba focused on what Muslim, they had a more likened to control. The rules are, if you pin the guy for 30 seconds is, was like wrestling, not as as, but you still win like judo. Ah. And as you attempt the P and every time the guy passed the back on the ground, you still making points. So in my final match, I guess the guy from the air force, very strong guy with maybe wrestling and judo background and he was whipping my ass man. He was just like, and the first like three rounds, three minutes in the first round, he stay on top all the time. And because being in the guide you're losing points. The squad is about 12 or 14 points in the first round in the second round is about 18 or 20 I tell you in the very final round I was about 26 or something points against the zero, you know, and I was just trying to do my think and in one like maybe a minute before the very final Matt around, I swept him and mounted and he isn't the same time I mount it, he's tried to push me away and I get like a moving arm luck and he not even tap, he's just yell.

Speaker 4:          00:24:52       So and then I win the fight like in the very final seconds. And you were down 20 something points. I don't know, even chance. I'm not there to, we need by points. I was there just to see if I can submit. It's, it's fascinating. And then the guy that, but like 15 seconds before the fight is in and then like the whole crowd was and then everything kind of who and then just

Speaker 2:          00:25:15       great.

Speaker 4:          00:25:18       No, it's totally fine. So when Eric Paulson showed you these tapes of shootout in the 90s, probably you already, you were already doing leg locks a little bit, right? I read that very like foot locks. I always lost straight foot lock. And then what Erik Paulsen showed you was like fancy new bars and stuff. Yes, because from the guard you just spin around and go with the straight knee law. So I get, I get amazed by this kind of, and I to develop, you'll know very quickly. It was just adapt to my game and was an, uh, an addition to the arsenal. You know, it was great. It's funny when you look back at old Eric Paulson fights in Japan, you look at the stuff he was doing it and people today still aren't even doing that because she's way ahead of the game to it. Eric Paulson was an encyclopedia submissions, him and Matt, those guys back then it looked like like advanced Jujitsu and of course, you know anytime you got the mountain there was always an arm bar, you know. But uh, you know, that time Eric was being trained very consistent. [inaudible] he's a good, a good brother in a training partner. We use, always been a great warrior and I have a lot of respect for him.

Speaker 2:          00:26:23       Great Guy. Very, very knowledgeable guy. Isn't it fascinating that we've seen just in the time that I started training from 96 on this adoption of leg locks in Jujitsu? Yes. In the early, in the 90s it used to be that leg locks per frowned upon when when someone went for leg locks, people get really upset. Hixon you at the first

Speaker 5:          00:26:44       Pan American games in 1996 and our 1997 here in Elsa Gundo and La, you must have been there, right? Do you remember that? It was the first Pan Americans, there was like 500 Brazilians. They shipped them all it were. And there was, the crazy thing is I was a blue belt in Jujitsu and I saw Ken shamrock tape of a toehold. So I was a blue belt doing told John Jacques Machado is academy. And uh, I competed in the tournament and so did Eric Paulson. And when I went through a toehold in this tournament, all the Brazilians started throwing that was almost a riot. They called the cough. There was the one shoes at me and Johnny Machado. I'll never forget him running in slow motion sliding. And I had the toehold that Johnny goes, you got to let it go. You got all this. So I had to told, and I'm looking around, so I let it go.

Speaker 5:          00:27:33       People are throwing shoes at me and water bottles and stuff. It was like a big deal. And I ended up losing, I let it go. And afterwards, Eric Paulson's in the parking lot, it was just me and him. He was a blue belt as well. And he was like his kid, we were like the same age, but he was like, I was like a little kid and he's like, you know, let me talk to the kid and goes yeah, let me show you a couple of leg locks. So he showed me a couple things like this weirdest leg lock that doesn't work and he admits it now that it was garbage. But he showed me this leg lock, he showed me this leg lock where you go like this is weird thing in the parking lot and I'll never forget that. I was like, man, this guy is the only guy who understands that, that uh, I liked toeholds and, and um, he was on my podcast not too long ago and he said, and I asked him about that movie. Do you remember that movie goes, Oh yeah, it's garbage. It's trash as well. Forget it raises that. Yeah. Cause we got them outside. Isn't it fascinating how these, these ideas, they get innovated and within our lifetime they started to get implemented and they get weeded out. The ones that work wind up staying, the ones that don't work fall by the wayside. What do you think about the IBJ JF banning heel hooks? You think that's a good thing? I like, I like

Speaker 4:          00:28:38       to first, um, of course it's a pleasure to talk about all this and uh, I can answer that because I feel like the heel hook has to be implemented in the top level fighters because essence is a solid technique. But because the is designed to stretch the ligaments, not the joint. You said difference between you going in your finger this way. He's going to, you're going to feel pain before it brokes yeah, but if you go this way, you're going to resist and to pop's. So he's just, ligaments is not a joint. This is a joint. This is a ligament. So when you twist the knee, the guy can still resist and when he feels it's going to feel the pop, he's not going to feel the pain to tap. So this is in a way, if you don't have the experience, you want to bust your knee. So we don't want to see guys we've busted me is just because they tough or just because they know.

Speaker 5:          00:29:42       So we four beat in a hole, the the, the heel hooks, but in the end and then had events at level like met Amaury is, or like premium pros, I think they should back bring back in because this is part of the game and you have to be responsible to let it broke or tap. And especially a guy like Tokyo, when you see Paul Horez, he's such a master at it. It's exciting to watch that guy fight to see how guys are going to deal with them. I would probably still allows heel hooks, right? That allows and Metamorris I in my experience, I've been teaching now 10 years and we've uh, uh, I allow heel hooks from day one only because I as an instructor, I don't want some leg lot guy coming into my school and tap and everybody out with leg locks. So I wanted all my guys to be very well versed in leg locks.

Speaker 5:          00:30:34       And in my experience we reap, we, he'll hook white belts. I can't even tell you the last time someone got hurt from it, he'll cook. I kind of, I don't even know, maybe, maybe once in 10 years, think that that kind of education that's going to positive because give the guy the sense he has to, if he feels the problem has to tap in advance, you cannot allow you to pop happen because you're going to bust her knee. And in Naga and grapplers quest, they allow heel hooks and you rarely ever hear about anybody getting hurt. And I think, I think once you learn how to defend it, it's actually people don't want to, people will tap generally. And some people that don't tap, uh, Gary, Tony was talking about the first time someone got him in a heel hook and, and his knee popped a few times.

Speaker 5:          00:31:19       He thought, well, if I tap now, it already popped. Why should I tap? I should just keep going now. And uh, um, if someone, I think if someone is going to let their knee pop or get hurt, I think it's their responsibility to tap. And if it pops is, is it really a big deal? I mean, it's part of the game. People get hurt. People get their knees blown out in basketball way more than Jujitsu. Again, soccer. Yeah, I'm going in 10 years. I, I can't even tell you that. Maybe led compressions a couple of times. Guys have had their knees pop from led compressions and even locked down. I've had a couple of guys get their knee pop, but heal hooks and reaping, that's not something that I ever had to say. We got to slow down. Be careful with the knee. Ribs, just no one really gets hurt.

Speaker 5:          00:32:03       But seems to be a technique that when people were ignorant of it, that's when people were really getting hurt more. Yeah, it was some times when they really want to go for the hood, they don't want to, they don't visualize the, the possibilities to hurt. So they go in and go full power from the beginning to the end. So he's not even a chance to the guy that he's already tapping late. So that's more like the, the, the, the mindset of the, the, the guy who's attacking. If you, once you break your knee is a great chance to do that then. And when we were adding wrestling to our Jujitsu classes, trying to combine it, now we separate, we have separate restroom classes and separate Jiu Jitsu class. But at a time when I was trying to combine together, we would have a day

Speaker 1:          00:32:40       where we just do wrestling and we do live ricin drills and we're all standing up. That's where everyone got hurt and it got to a point where he collided with each other and just trying to take someone down and tackling them. And then they plant on their leg wrong. Einstein broke his leg wrestling. It just was his leg broke cause he planted on it wrong. He got picked up. So they, there came a point where I decided, you know what, too many guys are getting hurt on wrestling day. So I cut wrestling out and you know, if you want to Russell, you go to the rest of the class and my class is just Jujitsu. But we do allow reaping. We do allow heel hooks and there's no one getting hurt from that. More from the wrestling. Does a famous match where you had with Mark Schultz, what was, what happened in that?

Speaker 1:          00:33:19       Because that's a very famous, uh, encounter and there's a movie coming out called Fox catcher that's based on, do you know the story behind this movie? Um, what was the guy's name that was a responsible Fox catcher? It was based on, there was the two brothers, the um, uh, uh, all the one Marshall, David Schultz, Dave Schultz got killed. And uh, it's, um, it's based on this Guy John Dupont who was this crazy rich guy who was taking these wrestlers and he was, I dunno, it was some weird gay shit. There was something weird about it. Pay For privates. He would, well not just that he set up a training center and pay them a lot of money and we just get real weird with them, wrestle with these guys. But he was like this old dude and you know, it wasn't like, he was like, you know, a guy who was really fit and really in a training and learning techniques. It was just real weird. And you wind up shooting. They creeped through every now and then. Well, he was a billionaire. I mean it was super, super rich guy. Um, uh, so this, uh, this movie's actually about to come out now, but his brother, Mark Schultz was, uh, fought in the UFC Olympic gold medalists. Fantastic wrestler. Like all time. Great Wrestler. And you and he had an encounter.

Speaker 3:          00:34:33       Yeah, well I was, uh, in a, in the Utah visiting my, my struck to be editable Pedro Sauer. Yes. And then, uh, we are invited to go to the Byu where he was coaching the wrestling wrestling team there. And as I get there, you know, looking to for training stuff and eventually he said, okay, let's train a little bit.

Speaker 3:          00:34:59       And then, uh, immediately we engage immediately he went to my guard and almost immediately he stepping out and then he was not happy at all. And then she put them in a triangle, a triangle first from the guard. Yes. And then he becomes a little more smart and he kind of, it come it. So it was a long second round. And eventually I went to his back and submit him again. And, um, after a few, few sessions, I make him tap some. And, uh, and he was very impressed. Like, wow, nobody did this with me. I mean, what's on I, I mean, he was stronger than me. I mean, of course a warrior. And he was not happy. I mean, uh, somebody said, once, you show me a good loser and I'll show you a loser. So he was not happy at all. And, uh, of course I, and I understood that.

Speaker 3:          00:35:55       And um, but eventually he, he, he's saddle and he understood was it technique involve and you start to become the training with Pedro and uh, become passionate about Jujitsu. He training a lot and he become like a supporter of the Jujitsu Cause in Utah. And, uh, and you know, it was a great experience because I can felt like the whole level of trainee and in body control he has, but it's still like at that point, the rest of us has no clue what is, you know, submissions. So what's kind of your not surprising thing for them, which is, doesn't happen those days. Do you remember specifically what moves holes brought from a wrestling and, and, uh, from Samba to how good way distribuition a good ways to, like if the guy grabbed you, you were able to, to, to make the movement, you go to the, his back, like a good turnovers. Um, a good, excellent sense of, uh, Nogi base control, a good grips to charm drags and stuff that thinks like a very, you know, he was training a lot with, uh, Bob.

Speaker 3:          00:37:09       Bob Anderson. Yes. Yeah. So he was a good friend of Bob Anderson and the barbarians to went to Brazil. So it was like, uh, he was the one who brought the wrestling ideas and concepts because he pushed us once to compete in Olympic wrestling. So it was, Hobbes was always for me a reference. You know, as I growing up, he was the champion and he was just a unbelievable guy. We for good heart and a passion for Zuihitsu loved, represent and he was my idol. You know, as I grow in up and I tried to follow his footsteps and uh, as they grow a nap, we all train hired among each other, we fathers. So my goal was beat halls. You know, my goal was to be better than him. And let's suppose the, our last 30 training, uh, maybe he, he, he beat me like in the first two or three. And then we spend maybe 20 trainings or maybe 25 trainings, even AARP, like back and forth. I start to get modern morning to his game and what this new strategy, Choo Choo catch me. And I started to become more comfort that when the surviving and then in one point I start getting dead vantage in the training because no luck either w you better or not. So in consistently I start to become more comfort that when then eventually I start to getting dead vantage some positions.

Speaker 4:          00:38:36       And then in one day and the, and the Rancho of my father, like in a weekend, we all get together, has a huge match. So I was training with him and I submit him first time, you know, what'd you get them with? A man was like, uh, uh, um, you know, I hear an Ogee gree, so you're not even remember. I think it was some kind of choke or something. But, uh, what I remember it was, uh, the feeling I felt by achieving my goal. I was making him feel like he was losing his position. And I felt the same way. I felt happy. I felt sad because was not, he is anymore. He's my self, my responsibility now and we know that. And nobody in the news, I mean, nobody knew. I mean, of course people saw the training, but at that point I felt like I was dare is still to support him, but I was better than him and we still competing and events coming.

Speaker 4:          00:39:45       And, uh, we always close the bracket because he goes into his weight division. I go in mind and we go together and the open division. So we always close the open, you know, and uh, I never will fight it. I mean, up should that day. He always been the first and I'm the Saquon the Maddow is here is even though I knew I could maybe change this, you know, I never ever will, if he's still alive he will be the number one and I'm number two based on respect base in, in Iraqi. So, uh, once he passed away I have to take over, you know, in represent fully and uh, but was, I mean he is my inspiration and uh, he's a great guy and then he misses him dearly. He died in a tragic hang gliding accident. How old were you at that time? Oh, I was, uh, maybe 20, 22, something like that.

Speaker 4:          00:40:39       So he was there when you fought Zulu? Yes, he was. He was my coach who was in my corner with my dad from, for people out there that don't know what I'm talking about. The Zulu maps that you had was one of them. That's like watching an old Ali match. Can you, can you put that up Jamie actually versus Zulu? Yes. I really, you know, this conversation goes very well and I, I mean, I really appreciate your talking about the past, but I like should make a little pause on this and, and really bring up the most, because we have to leave today. We have to be motivated and I'm very happy today to come here to explain and talk about this new venture I'm involved with, which is the new Jj GF Jujitsu global federation. Because talking about Jujitsu, talking about rules, talking about the future of shoe she had.

Speaker 4:          00:41:39       So I think, uh, we having a huge problem to be resolved, you know, and that's is crucial for the future. I see like this new organization will bring to the table the elements to resolve our problem. You know, I think our biggest problem today and they shoot so community is losing effectiveness. We be losing effectiveness drastically from the last 15 years because um, the way in order for us to restore effectiveness, I felt very appealing to me to engage in this venture, which through this federation we are going to try to resolve three important, I mean we have three pillars of, of, of, of action to try to resolve that problem. Jujitsu has effectiveness in what an MNF effective and like a fight. No, no effectiveness. I want to explain to you because it's different efficiency and effectiveness today I see the top camp champions very efficient on getting medals but they losing effectiveness in real life.

Speaker 4:          00:43:05       And if you see Jujitsu as I grew up, the core of Jujitsu was self defense isn't preparing the students to handle situations. Should they be evolutionary process of associates who brought the sport of Jujitsu and those rules diminishing that effectiveness in the search for the medal. So, and I like nothing can be boring for me, more boring then watch some fights in Jujitsu tournaments. Those days I believe in I'm in, they can choose between stepping on the brake or stepping on the, on the guests. They can choose because the rules favor if you strategically correct, you may go to go in the fight to fight as situation where you can control the pace of the fight. You can managing the whole tank and eventually by one or two moves, you get advantage. And when the model so great you have the metal, but sometimes that's chose a lack of desire to compete, a lack of desire to engage in a fair fight. La, a lot of times they see our white belt or a blue belt or a purple belt fight, which is much more appealing, has much more open situations, of course, of changing positions. Then a black belt who sometimes sit on the floor and it stuck like an acquisition who holds

Speaker 3:          00:44:32       stalling the whole action. So by doing that, he's efficient on get the medal, but he's losing effective is to handle real life. That's why is hard to see as you [inaudible] representative on the cage. Who translates that? I mean I seizures. It's translates your day something I feel like I never, we would fight like that. The guys who shoots a practitioner for life, his greatest talent, he's tough. He's sometimes a champion, but he don't fight the way I believe it's supposed to be fighting there. You know, he has no idea of clinching. He has no idea of sidekick, has no idea of a volley to the guard. They have a sportive guide all the time trying to do a more plotters in the, you know, instead, and the guy on top just hammering them down. So it's, it's kind of weird because without that kind of efficiency, I mean, I'm sorry, effectiveness.

Speaker 3:          00:45:29       A Jujitsu is losing, you know, he's losing, uh, the integrity, the whole culture, the whole concepts I trust and I believe all my life. So if I can clarify your, your issue is with points and with advantage points. Yes. For example, the new, this new situation will be, uh, this federation is not there to, to, to compete with other organizations. I'm not there to, I, I'm doing the job was not done yet. You know, based on this platform, this state of DRM platform, we try to have three different elements to work with de formation. I think division is to perform something or good service. Mine tension with this is to serve the community in the sport community, the worldwide Jujitsu community. In the sport of Jujitsu, thinking that I have three different elements. The first one is the communication aspect. Information through the site you're going to have a listing of all the academies on the planet.

Speaker 3:          00:46:43       We have a listing of all at the athletes profiles, downloads of fights. So they will have the option to request sponsors, show themselves. It's like a, a Google slash Facebook for the community. And uh, also we're going to have a master's council, which brings all the guys who have traditionally spend their lives in, in, in the Jujitsu community to have a voice, active voice for the community. So in the forums, sometimes, uh, somebody makes a question about a position, so the master's will be involving answers if they want and they will be highlighted because that's his opinion, that's opinion. And so people, the community want to start to evaluate what's beneficial and what's negative, what's the master has to say. So creates a network which is must need it to unified. The community. I see the communities, should they completely split, you know, they did.

Speaker 3:          00:47:46       Some federations had their own circuits, some either. So it's 30 sec, 30 events, one side, I'm under 30 and the other side. And then has, you know, Nag a seven Grep request, have dream, have IBJ JF. So all this is completely disorganized and completely split. So my intention is brink to the community. A sense of, of unity unification based on this information who is go for every, like another important point is have contributors from all over to breaking their reports of what's happening in this event. Who's the champion, who is dead and news and everything. So because some magazines should they, they completely partial, they just will talk and explain about bear athletes or in their society does not cover the whole community. So to this information, this solid, uh, efficient, uh, general information, the general, the whole community will be informed, we'll be connected, will be asking and being listened.

Speaker 3:          00:48:56       So I think that's a very important for the community. Another big pillar of our, our federation is the competition aspect, which by changing rules we restore effectiveness. How we do that, cutting the advantages. Because the advantage for me, it's like a, a ball in the ring is just touch. The ring doesn't make a point. How are you going to make a half point or it's, it's, it's the very hard to interpretate what is really real and what is not. What's our most, I mean it doesn't matter how many goals you try and hit the post. The score is what matters, you know? So I have points just creates a controversy in the interpretation for the referee for so becomes a very confused way. So back to the reality, you just go four clear points. And also another important thing is give mine was points for installing positions. What is it? Stalling position is a position where you hold with the intention to preserve their position, to preserve the control of the dynamic of the fight. You stalling because you want to be in control by using what I call a anti Jujitsu move, which prevents you from keep action. Because the idea is go both engage and see who's the best, who is submit, who's

Speaker 4:          00:50:28       passing, who is mounting, who is getting. And sometimes people to minimize that risk. They kind of keeping the situation on the UCONTROL, the position they can control. This leaves putting the lag in tango it so he's comfortable to proceed and to the point he needs to make a little advanced. So this diminish the effect of in is because this kind of strategy doesn't work in real life. So they were punished for that. Any grabbing, grabbing the referee come and say, Hey man, watch your grip after 20 seconds he already got a minus point after. Then they're going to get mine was again. And then eventually you're going to be DQ.

Speaker 2:          00:51:05       Is it subject to interpretation whether a guy is stalling or they're guys just, if they're canceling each other out? I'm sorry if it's subject to interpretation, whether it's stalling or whether or not they're canceling each other out. Like one guy is trying to advance the other guy stopping them at for advanced. They just both looking for the opening.

Speaker 4:          00:51:23       Yeah. But you can see easily who is wants to progress and who's once you just control the position for this guy who don't want to progress, he will be, I mean you can notice it. I mean in theory may is, but if you see it you can see who's just trying to minimize the action and try to wait for their opportunity and the other one who's tried to make it happen, you know, what about submission only tournament's do you let those, the federation also have this kind of rule. We have two sets of rules, the point rules system for tournaments and we have the challenge rules for can be even timing but for match for matchmaking like the Metamorris skyline or or any promoter who tried to do something like the baddest, the baddest purple belt. So there's no way division is no time limit.

Speaker 4:          00:52:12       He can approach that the time as you wish. Like okay let, we'll be 20 minutes Max. We will be 50 minutes match will be half hour match. We can think about Gracie worlds and Gracie nationals. They, it's all submission only. And after 15 minutes, if there's no sub submission, they're both disqualified. I disagree with that. That that disqualification I spoke with hose and uh, she may be, I mean we want to get into the better for the Jujitsu, but for me it's the same roles in case of a bracket. So I don't feel like both who kind of didn't submit, suppose sue should be disqualified because sometimes in the same bracket should tough guys, they fight each other and they could not submit to each other. And then some too, I mean halfway busters. Yes they want submit the order. So this guy advances and those two are disqualified.

Speaker 4:          00:53:08       So I don't think this is fair. Somebody has to come in from this. So the way I did is the first round goes full force and if the 20 minutes sand or 30 minutes, then it depends on the arrangement. After the 20 minutes you ask the guy you want to fight, the guy said yes and then ass Nigga you want to fight. Yes. So He's another round. So in the second round, we still don't have positive points, but every time the guy put himself in a position and he started defending himself without attempting to escape or giving the combat, just protecting or resting or whatever, the referee going to say, hey man, keep going acting or you're going to be penalized. So we have negative points for diminishing of combat tivity so at the end of the second round, if we see like, uh, somebody with mine was points, this one will be the loser, you know, because he displayed last desire or less gas or less techniques to be on top of the, the con, the con, the competition.

Speaker 4:          00:54:12       So his mind was because he's defending all the time, he was tired or whatever. So he gets minus points and then the other guy advances for the brackets. So that's the only change for this submission. Are you familiar with my avid submission only tournament as well? I don't know if you're aware of that. And it's very similar to Gracie world's Gracie nationals, but both at 15 minute matches, but both competitors aren't disqualified. We actually have an overtime round and and that and the overtime, it's kind of like soccer. I didn't want overtimes to be uh, determined by wrestling and a lot of tournament, it's like you go into overtime and, and whoever's the best wrestler wins because you get to take that and then they hold and they went. So a lot of wrestlers can go into tournaments and go, I'm just going to stall for regulation, taking into overtime and when with my wrestling.

Speaker 4:          00:55:02       So in order to eliminate that, I wanted to know who the best submission artist is, not who the best wrestler is. So my overtime, each person, like if we went into overtime, you get to start on my back with the leg cooks and an over under. And then we go, if you submit me, then I get to go on your back. And if you escape you win. But if I submit you, then we'd go another round. It's just, it's like a extra innings and then the next round you take my back, I escape, I take your back and I submit you, I win. That's an a dreamland of course. But we that way we get to find out who the best is at submitting. We couldn't finish and regulation. Now we go into overtime and we start on each other's backs. Like free kicks. Yeah but I think, I think this is a valid but you take the element of conquer that position. I think the fight has to be leaving in standing up. If the rest of the statue avoiding any avoiding of combat activity supposed to be penalized but allow, you could fake that though like a wrestler could fake it like take shots and one thing is for sure in this new federation and the same way we have the master council, we're going to have the development council and you are going to be invited right now to be part because I see people like you guys are not just know the

Speaker 3:          00:56:24       deal no that the sport but also has opinion Shumake and my idea is not riding my rules and stone. My idea is to follow the best pattern to create more effectiveness and more dynamic aspect for the sports. So the federation has this open heart and open eye and open years to kind of make the best conclusions for the sport. So all the rules can be changed. Everything can be adapted to a better, more define display off effectiveness. That's a beautiful thing. When will this go into effect and when will your first and injury? No, no, I'm not playing only in events. My idea is to serve service. So I got to service through the information I going to serve as to giving reference in giving guidance for the events. But even though they don't do my rules, I will legitimize everybody. And I, you start to relate the records of every event who went here, who went there.

Speaker 3:          00:57:25       And I start to putting everybody to become part of the same profile, the same, uh, mindset. And I will hammer the idea of why we don't do the best rules for Jujitsu because I bet they champions, should they, many of them, they're gonna say, oh, I don't like, I prefer to this or that, but I'm not here to educate those champions. I'm here to educate 85% of the competitive community today who is still white and blue belt. Those guys, they've been misled to understand the strategy of the game to get the meadows but they losing effectiveness in real life. So the change of rules aside of the education aspect of the federation is very important. How I see the service of the federation and the educational level because a lot of times guys coming from the competitive background and they from white to purple to Moran and black so they become tough competitors.

Speaker 3:          00:58:29       Sometimes champions they become famous. Then they opened the school and as they opened the school they teach what they know. That techniques who make them few champions so great but this is just like a a percentage off what he supposed to know to teach because not everybody wants to debt go that you compete. Not everybody has the skills and the toughness to engage in a in that kind of level of training. I feel like Jujitsu is there to favor the the community as a whole. I feel like the instructor, he has to be knowledgeable about self defense, about self defense for women, about programs for kids, kids class in law enforcement. So as the structor become certified, I mean I'm not, I going to validate all the audit, the, the, the, the destructors, all the black belts today, I'm not going to say you don't deserve it, but I will suggest to them to get certified through the federation because they will get elements for dairy schools become more efficient, retained more students, had a better teaching programs, which are the core of effectiveness.

Speaker 3:          00:59:48       And the other day I heard some black belts being asked for a student about self defense, hey teacher, you teach? He said, no, no. If you want to self defense, you go to grab my guy. You know. And I felt that's, this is just something who is goes in straight on my heart. Because for me, the core of Jujitsu, self defense, if you don't know selfdefence basically you don't know Jujitsu. You have to be ready to shoot, choose to defend yourself from a slapping, from a hug, from a headlock, from whatever. And if you don't have those concepts lineup, you become sometimes very path. We've tough years with very good grip and dudents forever, but you still counting on your own physicality. You still counting. You cannot teach that for the children or for a women. So by having differation presenting those courses in any spreading this all over the, the word, the teacher will have much more elements to have Molly students to feed the, the have more knowledge to feed, you know, the, here's the students in different levels and, and make a different job with Jujitsu, you know, so this is beautiful.

Speaker 3:          01:00:55       So your motivation is just to improve digits. Yes. You see a bad direction that it's going. Usually it's as losing effectiveness and we have to restore that buy in for me very well by understand the competition as a progressive thing to make you better fight or not to make a better competitor. You know, if you're a competitor sometimes at taekwondo guy, he's a great competitor but has nothing to do with real life. I mean, you want to be a fighter. Jujitsu is something you learn to protect, your honor, to protect your dignity, chew, to represent, to fight, to make money in the cage wherever you, your goals are. Jujitsu is there to support you in a very profound and deep cause, which is effectness effectiveness. The transition between Jujitsu and Jujitsu competition and mixed martial arts is it's a very tricky transition for a lot of Jujitsu fighters.

Speaker 3:          01:01:50       Yes. Especially when they don't have that kind of constant strong background. You know, I think if everybody who fights like crown, we don't have to set up rules because he wants to accelerate. He wants, he wants to be progressive, you know, he's not, once you won by points, he wants to go to the kill. So, uh, guys like him or Bouschet show or some other great athletes, they go and they choose to fight openly. You know, to see some other fights. They choose the strategy, strategic elements to just give them more chances. Just points, just points, just advantages. Sometimes 10 minutes fight Hannafin happened is just to advantage that stared at women. I don't expect you see this in a fight and nobody speaks. So by changing rules, we increase effectiveness. We create a more dynamic fights is more interesting to see, you know, nobody wants to see something boring.

Speaker 3:          01:02:46       And we create under this concept the possibility to unified the whole community. Not only this particular association or this federation, but everybody in the same polite. And then without taking anything from nobody, my vision is to create a worldwide circuit of Jujitsu, which represents the same thing. They are ASP for surf or the att for tennis, which brings major players like big sponsors and and, and until a vision for the sport. So first is unified, try to unify the rules, try to create effective is try to give a better condition for the teacher, for the school Warner, for the independent promoter. Because I cannot think and about, okay, I'm going to start to make my own circus and I don't validate, nobody's just me like other people do. So that's a a wrong way to unified and, and in educate the community in our culture for the future.

Speaker 4:          01:03:55       Raul said publicly that he feels a part of the problem, the stalling problem is the holding of the sleeves. Do you think, uh, is there a path? I, that's what I think too. I totally agree with them. I think the fact that you have to have your sleeve, you can't have your sleeve type because then your opponent can't grab it. I think that is so backwards. I think that it should be illegal to grab the sleeve illegal. I think it should be illegal. I think I think is possible to be illegal. What is, what is unacceptable is that grip promotes is only a cool off situation. I can grab anywhere I want. If my intention is to progress. Yeah. If I start to say, okay, come into me, come into papa and I stay here waiting to waste your energy and then when you make a mistake I sweep you.

Speaker 4:          01:04:41       That's kind of weak. Weak in your mindset. We can your progressiveness weekend, your effectiveness. So what if he stuck there? Like he has sleep and he stuck cause he's trying to pass and if p let's go of the sleeve then you're going to pass and it kind of just stuck there and you're like I can't let go of the sleeve because let him home man, let it go and go for the risk. Don't you think that would cause problems with the RAF and the refs interpretation of what stolen. Whatever is holding you feel not moving is a stalling. So you should have the MOU, hip movement and the angles and the quick fast on the news, whatever you do. Because if the guy don't make a complete pass

Speaker 3:          01:05:18       you still like arm was no advantage. Yeah. So it's just keep going man. Do you think it's less of an issue with Nogi is less because you know gay, you can stall in the 50 fifties and different things will be easier, but you have much less elements to submit. I feel like they know gay is just take maybe 70% of the submission options. Still some classic ones but not that many. So I feel like it's just last options, but it's still the same. Exactly the same fight.

Speaker 2:          01:05:52       When you did the Butoh challenge, we went to see that it was a great, great event. What has changed since your, your ideas when you put that on?

Speaker 3:          01:06:00       My ideas are the same would the challenge is a great rule for I stream event for a prime television event is not a sport competition event because ames the submission and only pros competing and it's like a premium sensational thank which has no time for stalling is all pushing forward. So the whole pressure I think is almost that, but in the tournaments has to be a little more supportive. We have to have points, we have to have a time limit, which is a quarterly to the the the the bout and so, but it's the idea, the concept of progressive concept of going to the submission has to be embraced. I mean it has to be in their whole mindset for every fighter, you know, it's not, it doesn't change the way you fight has to be folk was on the submit the guy to be the best, the best one out there.

Speaker 3:          01:06:53       When is your first big tournament? Are you planning on having a big worlds? I want to have like a in October the first event, but I already have, for example, next week, uh, in the second and third, the Vulcan Open. They, we will apply the new rules and it's all testing. We're going to test the rules to see because the idea is a positive, beneficial idea for the sport. And if we need to adjust a little more than change, like I said, it's not funny on the stone yet and we're going to allow the think too, if you know, hearing people and see and the conclusions because the mission is very positive and the means we will be adaptable. That's a beautiful thing. Yes, it is a beautiful thing. I'm very happy you've

Speaker 2:          01:07:36       seen Jujitsu progress from the time you were a boy to what it is today. I mean it's gotta be an amazing thing. An amazing thing also to have taken part in those first initial invasion moments when you guys came and you like this. So many of the Gracie in action videos where uh, you know [inaudible] is battling with the karate guys and you know, you're battling with judo guys and the people that had no idea what Jujitsu was. Yes, I remember very clearly when I saw the first ultimate fighting championship that I saw was number two. They had a video tape that was out and I watched it and I watched hoist win and a, I remember thinking to myself, man, I didn't even know that there was anything like this out there. I had no idea. I had been martial arts my whole life. I had no idea that someone could do something.

Speaker 5:          01:08:21       I was doing karate and man, when I watched UFC two first cause UFC one they didn't have any highlights to show cause they didn't release it.

Speaker 2:          01:08:29       Their idea was they were going to release two first and then they were going to release one for summer.

Speaker 5:          01:08:33       No. But you have to see one was they did have paper view for UFC one. Yeah, but it wasn't available on VHS. Yes. And then so once I heard that you have, see one was real, my friend said, Hey dad, cause I saw pre before it and I thought, oh that's fake. That's like WWF, that's not real. So I ignored it. And then my friend came home one day, my roommate and said, hey, I'm a challenge thing. It's real. Some Guy Guitar Center told me it was really, he said some, some Iranian guy who was just choking people out, he would just grab them by the throat. He said Iranian sumo wrestlers put the split, the split, the two, my friend, the guy who told me he didn't see it, he heard it secondhand. So he said, yeah, some Iranian apparently was grabbing people by the throat and choking everybody out.

Speaker 5:          01:09:15       I said some Iranian I go did, he didn't fight it. I was doing karate for six months ago. It wasn't a karate guy wasn't he goes, yeah, he'd be karate be boxes. He beat it. I go by choking them out like this. He goes, yeah, that's what they told me. And I go, so that second one came out, my friend called up goes, the ultimate challenge thing is coming out again. I go tape it, tape it. So I got home and I watched it and man I hated hoists, Gracie and that opening around cause I want him to karate guy to win. When he bought my Nokia Jr I'm like, that was my hero. I didn't even know who he was, but he did karate and I thought, okay, he's my hero. And then, but on the other side was Pat Smith and I didn't like him.

Speaker 5:          01:09:51       And then I didn't like holy there. But then by the time the finals came, I fell in love with voice. By the time the finals hit, I was in love with them. And I go, I got to find this because I wrestled in high school a couple of years and I thought either this is primitive wrestling or it's super advanced wrestling. I didn't know what it was. So I went in, I found John John Machado. I went in there and I got choked out 37 times by a purple belt by uh, uh, Dave Meyer, Dave Marsh. And I remember thinking one day I'm going to be able to do this with someone who just walked in. I was, so from that point on I was obsessed with this is okay,

Speaker 3:          01:10:28       like a changing life experience.

Speaker 2:          01:10:30       What was it like for you to be there too? Did Not Compete and knowing that you are better than your brother. There's all this talk about why you didn't compete

Speaker 3:          01:10:39       in the UFC. When I come here to support harden and, and the cause of uh, being like spreading the art. And then one point I was hoarding soldiers two to four, whatever. And um, and in another point I decided to follow my own pet and of course keeping keeping the alliance but going into my own direction and then hot and call me and ask me to train hoists. I didn't know why. And he said, then he said, oh, I blaming should do some events. I said, okay, let's do it. So I was his coach for the first and second event. And then somebody asked me through Eric Paulson and a assistant of, uh, of, uh, Daniel Santo, ut Nakamura was shorter. Yes. So He's send me invitation to participate, have a chart. I showed top competition, so, and then they send me a tape to see what the rules are about.

Speaker 3:          01:11:45       And I didn't like the rules, but I like the locks. So I started training the locks and I said, no man, this is, I mean there's no, I don't like it. So, and then we start to immediately say I don't want to do. And then my ex wife, much more calm statue negotiate with the guys in stature say by it. If we changed the rule. So was kind of talk and talk and eventually they decide to change the rules for a new open rules like in DNA advice, the way supposed to be the rule. So we create the new night, Eh Valley to the 94. And then when I signed the, I mean when I about to sign the contract harder and call me and said, Hixon, why are you doing? And said, yeah man, I'd be invited to fight in Japan. Said, no, you should not go because this goes against the family.

Speaker 3:          01:12:31       UFC is our game. We should be in support the family and stay here as high school coach. I said, man, that's not exactly what I vision for myself because I mean I'm here being coach. I get an one penny you, you put a lot of dollars in your pocket, you give me nothing. I'm in. You give me some money too for me to sit on the bench. We are in business. But if you give me a knife in the guys off of me, a lot of money to go. You don't even have it. You gave me, what did they offer you just gave them, she'd given me some, he said, no, no, he should do for the love of the Fetzer. Yeah Man, I love you guys but you love me and you'll give me enough in how I going to love you. I mean, so I, I went to Japan and dealing my think and stretch winning there and uh, and then I get my, my, my direction towards Japan, which is, was very good for me.

Speaker 3:          01:13:19       The community there. The location, the culture there. It was, was very, I mean I feel like home and uh, that's pretty much where I direct myself, my career, my end of my career to Japan and um, but now crones back to see what's going to happen. So were you worried at all with voice doing the UFC? Did you, did you think, cause he was the youngest one of the brothers riding him, he didn't compete as much in like are you worried at all that maybe it was yes, but the idea, the primary idea of high single in is because he was not the best one, but he was, something is going to be a good task for him is a good, you know, to break the ice and stuff but, but not exactly if something happened is always a backup you the backup. Yes. So I was there to just jump in in case if someone beat Hoy's you would have jumped into the EOC,

Speaker 1:          01:14:12       the chemo incident, but that after that, after that, that was already engaged in Japan. I was already, yes. I you had a contract with them over there. Yeah. Not for many fights. I never did,

Speaker 3:          01:14:24       did many fights, contract, uh, many, many fights in one contract. But I felt like hardened create a very awkward situation, you know, and uh, and uh, was a kind of little d division, you know, so I was not appealing to go there and show my support your voice and be there just so al loud to him to have his own destiny.

Speaker 1:          01:14:48       There was also the talk that voice was a slender guy who was younger. He wasn't as intimidating as you and that it, it sort of accentuated the idea of Jujitsu due to his technique based where it's, you're, you're a scary guy, you're scary guy now, but you were really scary guy then you're the only, you were the school yoke, Gracie one 85. Right? Something like that.

Speaker 3:          01:15:08       Yeah. It depends. I, yeah, I start Zulu was like I have 74 kilos, 74 killers of maybe one 80, one 80. Okay. Maybe, maybe a little less. And then, uh, my, my last fight in Japan I did with Nike. Yes. I was one a 95. Nice. Cause he was a guest for two 20. Right? Yeah. Nike for Nike should 30. Should they do something and then, uh, you know, I was making a preparation to go heavier than this, sometimes even 208 and then Korea cut down for the, to get my best shape.

Speaker 1:          01:15:47       When we spoke, it was a 2000 and when we had dinner, was it 2005 or something like that? Somewhere around there. Sure. Yet you were still thinking about fighting the higher level guys? Yes. Yes. But none of that ever materialized?

Speaker 3:          01:16:01       Never. Yes. Because, um, I never have the, after my, my son departure on 2000, I was about to make the best contract of my life was I just finished with, for Nike and I see what proposal meet on their proposal to fight Sakura, but he was still on the top. And then, uh, my son departure, I have to have like a moment for the family and regroup as a whole. By departure. Your son passed away. He passed away. Yes. So was a moment I could, I could escape by doing a fight. Say, okay, I want to focus on the fight, but I felt like my family will be completely unprotected and unsupported. So I said, no, I don't care about the fight I will be. So I spent about two years to to make the whole family feels good again and we all regain strength.

Speaker 3:          01:16:53       And, and and happened is again. So after that they start to, to get another, get a free agent for a couple of years. We tried to make something close to what I have, but the, the, the, the, the whole business in itself in Japan, the fact Sec Rabba last for four Vandelay and things like that, diminish that kind of huge purse. And then I felt like, no, I just want to fight if he's, if he's that much. So I to be very resistance about my next fight, some opportunities. But I kind of push away. And to the point on 2008 I was already moved back to Brazil for a while. A guy from Texas, even for items that you compete in a new event and pull me to fight feather. And a, I was looking for that, but I was have a little injury on my hip and on two way I'd be able to feel good to train me.

Speaker 3:          01:17:49       I could not sign. And because he has a deadline in terms of promotion and search, I could not sign without having a hundred percent confidence because if I sign, I will fight. I'm not going to and I don't have the time I want to get. So I said, you know what? I don't want it. And in my heart I went to the beach and said, thank you God for everything I have. I'm out. So I stopped competing, not exactly the way I want, but I felt like I have to respect God's decision and I just don't want to just dip a deicing my life for the money, you know, for. Okay. The guy pulled me mine, I go there and so I feel like I have to, butcher represents Jujitsu. Either I go 100% or you know, I hope somebody else got me and then I'll get to see what ground does all the great fighters that you saw during that time from the time well hoists entered the UFC till the time that you retired, the guys like Mark Coleman and boss route and fade or were there any that you really wish that you could have had an opportunity to match up against?

Speaker 3:          01:18:56       Um, I always visualizing myself against the number one, you know, I could not even think about. So one point, it was Coleman, you, the point was, you know, uh, I mean you name it, the champions and then feather get the rise in. That makes it like a big expression. So I could not think and about other guy. True to represent your shit. So, you know, I have all this revision that, but the set of rules are different. You know, at the time we could express technique with more because we have time. You know, I never, somebody asks me, Oh yeah, you have only few fights in MMA. I said, no, I never fought them in me. I always fought volley too though because MMA is a different animal. You go there for three rounds, five minutes is better to have offensive techniques. Then defensive techniques that the defense not going to do good for you is going to do good if you have at least one round, 10 minutes.

Speaker 3:          01:19:53       And then another. So if you have like my fights arise, endless rounds of 50 minutes is endless rounds of five minutes. So, and that way you can prepare yourself for a different strategy. You know, you have to follow the movements and you cannot just go all the way empty or gas and then fuel up in empty again because you know, if you amped your gas and the wrong time, you in trouble. So all the technique in stretching or guess and be calm and finding comfortable positions, those are the street right now. Now it's becomes a very stream of very physical. You see athletes in the same way division, but a guy who fights in the one 55 walks around, we find 81 85 you know, so the technology on the sport today is a huge thing. The physicality. That's why taking any techniques is only a piece of it.

Speaker 3:          01:20:47       You know what chrome does today is not only training Jujitsu and become comfortable in the skills he trained like a dog and all the elements he can do to become a cleric and explosive and physical and then going to lost weight like everybody else plus the technique which I feel and one point we will be the edge he needs to, to make the difference. So do you think there's something missing in today's mixed martial arts that, um, that the original Jujitsu sort of expressed this, this idea of having an open round, having a no limit fight? Is the, is there a room for that tonight, do you think? Or do you think we're, we're hampered by this idea of a three hour paper view window or two hour television window? It's funny because, you know, the other day I got caught watching, I fought our match in tennis, you know, it was a great match was along and the still going one more says, oh man.

Speaker 3:          01:21:41       And you'll see, I have no idea they were that long that long. Your Palm Beach and the Dow and the s I think French Open last year I was five hours, five hours, five hours nonstop man. And they break and start again. And the advantage was unbelievable, you know? So if you're passionate about tennis, sometimes the game can be like 45 minutes sometimes can be couple of hours because you there in the action, you know? So for me when we talking about engagement, we talking about, I mean the best one out there and when I see a fight after 50 minutes because somebody punched once or fallen top or just give him the tro. Both guys stand up, they both design and then the time is over. Who wins the fight in my opinion, supposed to be a draw because how the guy can, can we just, because one more point, the guys are warriors, the guys are willing to go.

Speaker 3:          01:22:40       So it's always like halfway to what's supposed to be, you know, because Eh, okay. You have to decide by points after a few. Okay. So, I mean, it's hard because, you know, sometimes I even have the best of it, but that's doesn't guarantee if the fight goes longer, if he's still that, because toughness, resilience and in heart and technique, they all want to pay in one point, going to be a big, a big situation, you know? So it's for me, not the, did the, you, the rules today in the UFC and such doesn't translate. The best guy out there translates the most agile, the most tough. The one who get connect first, you know, because sometimes the fight can be either way. The whoever connects first, whoever makes the fruit can win. So it's kind of hard to a virus. But if you put two guys in the cage and okay man, whoever's get out first is the winner.

Speaker 3:          01:23:41       So, and that's a different animal because you have to be technical, you have to be patient, you have to be. So, you know, I can see, uh, first is the expectation is all in the how chrome gonna do. But if confirms what I believe can be done eventually, I feel like grown will be comfortable to challenge anyone for a no time limit fight. Because I mean I don't care if he's Velasquez, I don't care if he's John John's. If crown do what he has to do with the time he has to do, I believe on him. Like I believe in myself. If I have the help, should they and the physicality I so I, I like to have, I mean I don't see a guy just because he's winning on the cage, he can win me cause they don't see the opportunities happen on the cage.

Speaker 3:          01:24:34       I'm not going to give those opportunities. So it's hard to say, but you know, the way division doesn't make too much difference for me if I have the time to, to, to cook and slow burn. But if the thing's kind of, if even my way division 80 kilos for example, if I want to fight that guy, we've had 95 kilos and make a technology. So I going to fight a different monster in five minutes rounds is almost impossible. How are we, I mean, so and then that's kind of unbalanced now based on the stream aspect of the sport, the physicality of the sport and the technique who has to be applied. So the difference between a fight and a match, the difference between a fight in a sport and in a fight, they're just two guys going out each other. And I agree that there's many, many, many fights where a guy when a ten nine round and another guy when the other 10 Reiner and then one guy when the final round, maybe tonight a little troll or something, it's a draw to be.

Speaker 3:          01:25:29       It's not done. It's like sex without an orgasm. Yeah, complete days. He's men and normally happens. I mean sometimes beautiful knockouts, but sometimes you know, it's just, you know, a too much strength, too much physicality and every time goes to the flooding I immediately stand up. He, because if he knows if he stay on the ground, he's losing time and he's not going to be able to capitalize because the time is not as long as enough and too, so that's kind of, you know, a great area is not a, it doesn't have the appeal for me to see a good, a good match. What about when hoist fought Sakuraba and they had that crazy 90 minute match? Yes. What about that was uh, an idea of like having these long, long matches [inaudible] Jujitsu. We need time because we don't have, I mean we give that vantage off weight, we give advantage of, you know, whatever.

Speaker 3:          01:26:19       So let's at least have the time for us to be becoming strategical. But would you have preferred that kind of a fight to be no rounds though cause that fight they broke up into a series of rounds. Yeah, I'm in at that point I felt like it was a lack of action of, I mean hoist supposed to fight better. I was not on his side. And a, I see a pads on on him too sometimes make little mistakes, which when I was there, I was focused on making him few sharp and we find not dad. I felt like a little fuzzy. I had to do it mentally. His focus was not. So it's a lot of different elements for Chu Chu, Chu, Chu, Chu, Chu justified, you know, because I believe hoist has elements should beat Sakuraba, you know, and, but he didn't, so it was just, he did the second time. Yeah, the rematch. Yeah. He found the second time in a la right. Wasn't that,

Speaker 5:          01:27:15       were you there when he fought him the second time? Did he match? No. No. Did you, he, you know, he beat him, right? Yeah. And that's the rematch. We Oh, you were aware of that, right? No, I'm not. Oh, okay. Yeah. They had a rematch and he beat him here in la one. Right. It was k one. It was at the coliseum. That was the first time. Brock Lesnar fraud too. Yeah. Now there's a, a lot of problems. Jujitsu guys have world class Mundey Al blackbelt champions have an MMA is they get in the cage and it happens. I would say it's a big reason why they ended up getting cut from the UFC as they ended up fighting wrestlers. Like everyone at the top 10 is really hard to take down the UFC. So did you just a guy will come in and he's fighting a guy who wrestled his whole life.

Speaker 5:          01:28:04       There's zero chance that he's going to be able to take down that rest are. So He's forced to kickbox right. So the wrestlers forcing the kickbox kickboxing fight because the Jujitsu guy can't take down the wrestler. Do in those situations. Um, uh, like, uh, I dunno if you remember Nogueira when he fought Tim Sylvia, the big giant guy, he could not take Tim Silvia down. So he eventually shot Tim Silvia sprawled a little bit and then Nogueira pulled guard. He was on his back. He swept him, he got on top and then he choked him out with the Guillotine. So in that situation, the guard pool saved Nogueira like, cause what do you think about it?

Speaker 3:          01:28:43       I 100% I 100% confident in the guard because what I see today in the display of great Jujitsu fighters in the cage is they have the guard, but they have a sportive guard. They don't have a valley to the garden. Yes. They not dangerous the bottom.

Speaker 4:          01:29:02       Yes. So they become technicals from the bottom against the dangerous ground in pound. Yeah. So they get all dead. They're getting all that these advantage. So in my perspective, for example, crown, he's been training to deal with tough wrestler, stuffed boxers, but he don't try to apply wrestling against wrestling because he going to need another life to become like a shoots or like a Matt Hughes or like some other tough, what is the strategy for chrome when he fights a rustler that he can't take down, he brings to the guard. So he's so golf bowling has something that he's thinking about guard his no other option on the ground. Jujitsu has to be happy on top in happier on the bottom. Yes. People frown upon. I'm a big advocate of pulling garden and they made their fighters that have done it. There's a guy named Paul Sass from England.

Speaker 4:          01:29:52       He pulls guard all the time. He's a master of pulling guard. He knows exactly how to do it. He shoots deep. The guy sprawls and as he sprawling, he pulls guard and he's, he puts people in triangles, triangle victories in a row. Yeah, he, but the triangle is risky because once you know how to defend, like unluck, you'll becoming available for granted grounded pounds. So if the guy is completely safe on the not getting caught in the triangle, your attempts of techniques, I kind of diminishing your capacity to survive and to defend yourself. So you attacking techniques from the bottom, but he's still on the rich. Yes. So the idea of a perfect valley to the guard is save your distance. You don't get pounded by those surprising elbows like John Kalench over her. No, no. You cannot clinch. You have chosen in the legs and you have to heat with the legs.

Speaker 4:          01:30:44       So it's always a striking from the bottom. You know, it doesn't have to be quick. So you don't believe that you should be clenched. And only if the guy, if the guy promotes that, if he wants to space to hit you, you need to be comfortable and hit him back. So he's a fight where imagine a 12 year old kid laying down on the ground, we feed to you. If you start, you're using the foot is going to be hard for even you is a big man to reach. Yeah. So there's no use of the legs. People has no clue how to striking, how to use. I know in UFC has some illegal heal from the barn and you can, but you still can use different strikes. You know, you can even have the distance to survive and to be completely protected against elbows. And, and the issue though that if someone can disengage, if you're on your back and you're trying to not clench and not hold onto them, your Jujitsu practitioner, the guy can just disengage you, haven't they? They just stand up. Once it does engage, he's escaping from the fight. I can stand up again and keep the same process of bleaching. So, so now crowns in a situation where he's fighting a wrestler and he can't take them down. Then he pulls guard. Yeah. And then he opens up his legs to kick. The guy stands up. Now he's got to stand up again. Yes. So

Speaker 2:          01:32:00       they could just keep doing that over and over again. Like how does he went? Chocolate Dell, who's an expert. Stryker as well as the rest of the very tough to take down, but also an expert striker. When you get that guy to the ground, don't you want to optimize that opportunity as much as possible and hang onto them while you're on the bottom?

Speaker 3:          01:32:15       That's depends. Depends where the way division where, what is the weight distribution is. I have to obey the sense if he's on me, I lose sweep him. I will be on his back in no time. If he's away from me. If he wants you looking for distance, I have to understand that and respect that. Then protect myself to don't get founded, you know? And and that process of, okay, I don't want to engage. He's moving back and then you stand up. And all of this process. A lot of things happen. What is important for as Jujitsu fighter is know everything about the anti game off the Stryker. I don't make grown, I don't try to make crone a good striker. I want to make him comfortable to in and out. I want to make very comfortable to fight inside with knees and elbows, you know, be, be dangerous inside, be comfortable on top and be very comfortable in the bottle and the action man.

Speaker 3:          01:33:13       It because it's a lot of, even though in those five minutes fight is a lot of action. I mean there's a lot of stalling is a lot of studies, a lot of disengage. I mean they engage in it, it'll be, and then they separate and okay now let's think, let's see who's fight. It's hard to see a guy who's just goes like, and I feel like the, the great uh, element to give it to strategy of growth is going to keep a prat consistent pressure. That means he's not going to be studying or in a distance where the striker fuels, like waiting is going to be the two out or chew in. And then once it's in, let's fight the fight, let's fight like a, you know, elbows, whatever. And then immediately the fight goes to the ground, no matter if it's one on top or on the bottom. And then the consistence of this, I feel like opportunities will rise.

Speaker 2:          01:34:08       Do you watch MMA a lot to this? Did you watch Bj Penn's last fight? Yes, doubt that. If I was very sad to me, very sad to watch. Um, and I was very frustrated watching it as a Bj Penn Fan, as a Frankie Edgar Fan, I thought it was a great performance. But one of the things that frustrates me about Bj is that he very rarely attacks from his back. When he's on the bottom, he puts feed on the hips and he just kind of holds on.

Speaker 3:          01:34:33       Yes, maybe he was not exactly, I dunno. I mean he did the poor, a poor, poor game from the bottom and my perspective, he supposed to have a little more um, elements, Choo, Choo, Choo, Choo. Not preserve his integrity but also to attack, you know, and I don't fell that then I feel like I'm in, he's just not doing what he's supposed to.

Speaker 4:          01:34:56       Eddie, we talked that, yeah. That sort of frustrated you a little bit too, right? Yes. I don't know if you're aware of the six and, but I'm, I'm obsessed with, I've been obsessed with developing the best guard for when they're striking, I analyze it and to death and I'm the guard that I comprised. I put elements from, you know, my students helped me. Nina Schembri helped me. So I put all these elements together, but it all started off when I was on this quest to put together the ultimate guard for MMA because I was seeing too many guys just get beat up in the garden. I thought we got to like, I felt like you had like the effectiveness is gone. What is the problem? Why are people getting pounded in the guard? We have to change this. So the first thing I studied was you and Henzel.

Speaker 4:          01:35:41       This was back in the nineties I go, okay, well I'm going to, I'm going to attempt to improve the guard in MMA. So I looked at you and I looked at him Zanga what are they doing? They're in full guard and their whole holding the over hook to prevent the punch. Like anybody tried to punch in the guard with the right arm, you would over hook it. And when headbutts were legal, your, your left hand was like this. You were like this protecting the head bud. But then when they met head ahead of what's legal, you don't have to do this no more. So you could hold the head now and now in this position with the overlook, you have full guard, you're holding the head. There's a clinch there. So to me as trying to be a Jujitsu scientist trying to, I'm like, if that, that is the stance in MMA, that's it.

Speaker 4:          01:36:23       You enhance or that's what you guys are doing it. You look at all the old fights, full guard stopped the paunch hold the head. And so to me that was the starting point. Yes, I agree. And uh, but Jujitsu is a, is an animal whose never stopped to grow. Yes. And one day I was comfortably in California watching a fight in Brazil and then I saw like I eight men tournament where fabulous Janelle was fighting mark care in my care was the first time he'd show up in the end. The first time I saw him fighting. That was his first tournament. Yes. So, and he went to the finals with fibro and I knew Fabul I train with him. He's a brother, you know, we, and I saw what he did with fiber. You like stay on thought ground and pound and smashing the elbow on his fee after five years to forgetting to his arm and was like next day he was all your flame arm and you go into the, the airplane like this, you made almost lose the arm because then they give antibiotic. We're never, but anyway, after I saw that fight and the in the lack of options, fiber was there. Next Day in the morning, I wake up, I call my son Hawks and he's down to 11 years old, about hundred, 10 pounds. He said, hug. So I'm coming here and then I went to the garage on my mats, said lay down, put him, lay down. And I tried to represent the same position because the, the, the different, the size weights does almost the same from fiber would yell to kid, then me

Speaker 4:          01:37:56       for four Alexson. So I kind of immediately put him in the fibers position and I put myself in and, and uh, and uh, mark your position and then I start, you will analyze his was insect crow Huxson do this, do that, move a little more this way. So it was not, we're not a fighting, but I tried to find him a position for him to be comfortable and I spent about 45 and 50 minutes searching is studying with him because I liked that kind of unproportional size. When I finish that, that section and totally like I reinvent myself in terms of what are you going to do if I have to fight my catch your model because I was satisfied with the angles. I could put Harkin in our that you resist my leverage, my angles, what exactly I saw in the day before. So that means from one day to a neither.

Speaker 4:          01:38:57       I kind of focus myself in fix it. The problem I saw with fabulous and at that point I felt like, okay, I'm fixed now I'm ready to fight for new wears out your model and what does this, what is the stance? What did you change? I could not, I could not have him go hawks and could not have him in control. He has to create distance. He has true how shen across the belly not he has to use defeat more properly on the hips. Yes, he has to use the knee on the chest. Sometimes he has to use the element of, of as I approach to getting better position, the bottom guy has to heat because if you don't we strike. You don't make the guy kind of go back. So he's a combination between fighting in Brazil we have two different names when you bra and when you fight.

Speaker 4:          01:39:51       Fight is more like a sportive and when you Brah you like, uh, just do it whenever. So technically speaking, when somebody wants to add back me as a brawler, I don't want to fight a broad back. I want to be technical and survive and be comfortable and soon his statutes say full, I cannot have anything here. Let me be taking code to see if I can advance. And that's the time I will blow against him and make him get confused. So I have to change your strategies as he come. If he come in to be a fighter, I will be aggressive. I'd be mean if he come in to be a brawler, I will be technical and I will be comfortable. So that kind of sense of change gives up perspective for the the bottom guy, it should be on on edge, which will be on top of the, the office.

Speaker 4:          01:40:39       Now Mark Kerr in that fight that you're talking about, fibers or show headbutts were legal. So that was a huge part of how he was getting busted up with headbutts. But since then headbutts it becoming legal, uh, we're the headbutts a big reason you decided to change your guard stamp also, but the elbows in the reach and the way the guy position himself, you know, and the way, uh, fiber was always with the leg cross. He was falling exactly what he learned and what he saw. And he, he could not have the time to improvise. Nobody expect Mark Caribbean tough as he was then. The monsters just happened in front of Fabio and he has to deal with whatever he didn't know. He was crying and throwing up in the locker room before that. Fine. Yeah, he is. He was emotional. Yes. Very nervous. And I mean, shows in the little documentary he did. He always have, but then in one point he's a potential. He was, the men should be beating. He was like, he was enormous. Yes. And, uh, you know, as a fan, as a fan of Jujitsu and a fan of mixed martial arts and valley to dope, man, I would just wish you had had those opportunities to face those guys. I would have loved to have seen any true,

Speaker 5:          01:41:50       ah, now I'm what I, like I said, when I was trying to figure out the best MMA guard, I was looking at you, I was looking at Hixson grabbing the overlook and, but the one thing I knew is if that's the defensive posture, this is what I was thinking. I didn't know you changed it up. But at that point I thought that was it. That's the defensive posture. Someone was in your guard, you have to defend first. So I thought, well okay, that has to be the stance. So we have to create or offense from that stance. So the defense is first and do we have off fence from the overheard and my instructor John Jacques Machado, and he is one of the only guys I know of out of all the top Jujitsu guys that his whole game is based on the over Hook and not grabbing the sleeves because his left hand, he was born without fingers.

Speaker 5:          01:42:36       So no matter what, whether it was Geeky or no geek, he needed that over hook cause he couldn't control the sleeves. So his overall game was translated to a students, me included. So I was always looking for the ovary because John Jack was my master and, and then when, when he got invited to Abu Dhabi, before he went to Abu Dhabi, there was a lot of legends there that a lot of Jujitsu legends that were going to Abu Dhabi and without the gay, there was no offense, there was a lot of boring matches. But John Jack shows up and he just rises above everybody. If you watch what John Jack did in Abu Dhabi, he didn't change his left arm, didn't change without a gears. I know, gee, I'm still going to grab that over Hook. Anyways. Everybody else was lost because they were used to their fighting stance or guard fighting.

Speaker 5:          01:43:23       Sam's was sleeve color, color sleep. So without the Geeta had to change everything and they weren't used to it. They didn't have any offense from there. So to me, I took what you and Hanzo, oh we're doing what the overlook and the controlling, but that's how John Jog fights with the over hook. So all his sweeps, John Jackson just look, look at all the sweeps in Abu Dhabi. He's throwing people around. He, his first year he submitted everybody. He was like the first Marcello Garcia. Everybody was freaked out like how is this guy doing it? They they, they didn't even understand it, but to me it was like it was because his game didn't change. When he's training in the gay, he's trained for Abu Dhabi. The, the people that we're training in. The key, before they weren't trained for Abu Dhabi, he was, cause it was all over every, he was sweeping wrestlers, all Carro Uno.

Speaker 5:          01:44:05       He was all over these guys. So for me that over Hook not as not for John Shock, that over hook is important for grappling, not even for valid Tudos. So if he did valid due to or if someone with that style guard did violet tutor, the overhead game automatically takes away the punch and he has authentic from that style too. So for me that became the, the basis and the focus for the ultimate MMA guard was to master the over Hook like, like John Jock and not only just defend but put those butterflies in and try to sweep or set up triangles like you, you have an overlook you sweet pea basis, you grab that risk boom triangles. So I thought that was the uh, based on what you and Hanzo did and John Jack style because because of it was like a blessing in disguise. Him Boring born without fingers.

Speaker 5:          01:44:55       It is, it was a blessing disguise. He's in Abu Dhabi legend. Everybody looks at John. Jack is Yoda. Like how did you come into Abu Dhabi and finish everybody? To me it was just that overhaul game. He didn't really have to change much of his game. So that's how Marcella Garcia, that's his philosophy to his philosophy is, and he said this in interviews it, if you can't do it, if you training, there's a guid technique that you can't do Nogi throw it out, only focus on the techniques that are going to translate to Nogi. So that way when you're practicing the Geek, you're actually practicing Nogi as well. So John Jea or Marcello is very against being reliant too much on the color and too much on the sleeve. He stays away from that because even take downs, he doesn't want to do judo takedowns because no, that are not going to work as much. He wants to do take downs at the in the guid that translate Nogi. So, um, that was, that's just this, the conclusions that I came to, that's how I trained my fighters that are finding an Mba. And it all started with watching you and Henson. Yes.

Speaker 4:          01:45:58       I, I completely, you know, fuel, like that's a good standard position too because you have to have a control in stuff. But the evolutionary process brought all that kinds of the guards, you know, and uh, I kind of also, uh, find my, my comfortable those days and, and ensure a more spacey guard. The more like towards my father's guard was because he's was very weak guy, always handle big guys and he don't have like this kind of strength or control Europe over here, his opponents. So he was more like hip movements and using the ankles, losing the food, you know, it's more like a, a very Lito from the bottom, uh, allowing the guy to get lost. So it's a combination between the two I think is today's is the perfect option.

Speaker 5:          01:46:50       Why do you think Ronda Rousey is the only fighter in MMA today? That when she, she's pulling off her arm bar. Looks Amazing. Have you seen her? I like, of course it's why his, as soon as she's in the guard, as soon as she's not going to wait, she's going to go and attack that arm and she goes right to it. She doesn't wipe and I've trained with their many times and her arm bar is legit. It's, it's not a joke. It's, yeah. To me, I think she has the best arm bar in MMA today because she's, no one has pulled it off as much as she hadn't. Yes. She hasn't really gone against top level Jujitsu girls. But, uh, based on me training with her, I think that she can, she can tap out. It's going to be harder of course. But why do you think she's the only one? And there's all these black belts and Jujitsu and MMA and they're not, they don't look anything like Rhonda Rousey. Why is that?

Speaker 4:          01:47:40       Um, she's a special girl. She's very competitive. She's, she's a very talented person. But a side of this, she have a heavy trainee in judo, which defines her character, you know, defines her hair, her desire to train, hard to compete too. So being a, an Olympic level judo player is being a wrestler in that level. That's bringing Q two on different level, you know, it's not being just, um, an athlete. She is a super athlete. She is very defined and very, very much, uh, specialize in one thing. Their game. She hair game is always like going towards the same pattern and in the opponents she's facing a, he is not exactly prepare for that. I feel like nobody has the skills on the ground to, to, to fight her and nobody has the, the heavy hands in the situation to, to beat here in standing up.

Speaker 4:          01:48:51       So everything's kind of even up. But Gwen goes to the ground when the, the, the opponent gets the first troll and falls like without seeing it get lost. And then she, she, her movements are very, very effective and, and, and we will capitalize on that. But you know, um, maybe five fights, then fights more beautiful winds. But eventually she got to have a person who has the same elements and then she's going to start, you have competition, you know, because so far it feels like even too easy, you know, it's like not even a competition for it. She's like a Mike Tyson.

Speaker 5:          01:49:29       She's like, when Mike Tyson was his job, eventually a Cyborg. Rhonda is going to happen. Dana's going to make sure that happens eventually. How do you see that going?

Speaker 4:          01:49:41       Oh, that's interesting because you know, um, she will have the, the preparation, the mindset, the heavy hands and also the, the, the, the skill to become like a, a competitive for four Honda I think. And he's unpredictable. Like, you know, any fight, you know, you gotta put your money down, who would you, there's no reason for me to put my mind. And then Honda, I mean, he's in a good, I mean I, it's getting better too. Did you see her last fight? Yeah, she's improved. She's throwing combinations with the judo throws and her throws. They're just out of control. Yeah. She starts throwing people and, and new HSA. When she found me shut Meesha, the legit wrestler, Meesha can Russell and she was making some big mistakes though. She was very high up on her. Above her weight was above the hips. I mean, I think there was a lot of pressure involved in that fight.

Speaker 4:          01:50:40       She would, you would think that when you in Nma generally when someone starts doing something that's effective, that wasn't a done before. Like the front snap kick that Travis Browne is doing now. Serone he's doing it all the time. Nobody was stolen that we need to see it first work in the UFC. Nickel, Oh man, the front snap kick or the rear leg snap kick to the chest and that's working. So that's huge. Now, five years ago, no one throw it. They thought it was a waste of time. It doesn't work. That only works in the movies. But there's all these kicks, head kicks and, and now that we've seen Rhonda show the effectiveness of focusing and drilling that armbar over and over, and she talks about you. I do. You think people aren't paying attention to it and aren't going? Look what works. Look what happens with the arm bar when you do it 100,000 times.

Speaker 4:          01:51:28       Let's do that. Let's do you think they're not doing it because she's a girl? No one's paying attention. Really, you would think is easy. I mean, hair performance is, it reflects, it reflects a life. Even her parents aren't involved in judo. Yeah. So, uh, it's a lifetime of achievements is a subconscious reflex is not something which you educate people. It's like you don't think you could learn it if you practiced hard enough, you have to be like a, at least a classification. The classification phase to go to the top, top 10 in judo is not just learn is dedicate yourself, your sweat and tears and blood is intensity to get there. You know, it's like being a Jujitsu champion is one thing. Doing what crown does two days. Another thing. He is not only fighting hard but he goes and train hard and your run hide and lift weights.

Speaker 4:          01:52:27       Whatever he does, he does with the compromise to excel. And that's a mindset. There's not exactly, you teach, it's something I believe Honda is a special girl because she put herself in that kind of level of stress and she handled and she, I mean the training is hard. The comps, the focus is hard. She's serious. And does the whole formula is there to support him, have victories, you know, he's not a flake or it's not as good luck. You know, he's not, oh [inaudible] come here, let me show how to defend the analog and now you go, you ready to fight? It's not like that, you know, so anyone in the, in the mixed martial arts, it's coming from a background because they see mixed martial arts egg as a good exposure, as a good situation to make money to me. So they come in with I average background to try, you know, their best.

Speaker 4:          01:53:19       They sometimes having from the the, the Hasni family and then learning some box, some Jujitsu, some defense and go, they're coming from the judo and goal. They're going to be from the Jujitsu and go into learning a little bit here and there. But very few are like, uh, like uh, Randy couture, which is already established champion like a, like a Coleman, you know, guys who have defined their lives in, in one thing and then they breed to another, but they have already the sense of, you know, they believe in themselves. They can capitalize on the mistakes they forward forever. So those things that, you know, you don't buy it on the, on the work ethic on the supermarket, you know, those things, his lifetime experience is high chew. Yeah. The intensity that Ronda Rousey brings, the training just to life itself. It's very difficult to replicate and that it has, it resonates throughout everything she does.

Speaker 4:          01:54:17       She's crazy. Now when in the best way, crone when against Shinier Okie. I'm assuming that you studied a lot of Shinya Aoki tapes. Do you I personally think he's, uh, one of the best at Jujitsu and MMA as far as he's gotten so many submissions. You get you with leg locks. He has a great rear naked choke has guards really good. Yes. Um, were you impressed by watching tape of a Shinya? Shinya is not only I'm impressed by tapes. The first Buddha challenge I did he win with honors. You know, he, he winded the Buddha challenge in some meeting. Everybody, you know, he won your yeah, the [inaudible] has different way divisions. And here's way division. He makes you fight since we meet bolt. And who, who were the guys? Do you remember? Uh, uh, Carl. He fought two guys too. I didn't even really know who he was in 2005 to tell you the truth then you already know.

Speaker 4:          01:55:13       Yeah. So anyway, I felt how Tavi, how tight, how tight to help rescission. His submission, he got a flying arm in lock in the first guy and the food log in the second guy. So I felt like he's very versatile, versatile, you know, he has a highlight reel of judo where he would define armbars in judo, just one after another. And that's was something I absorbed in. Then we, in our training we've grown, I said, and we are kind of decide to, because he was very comfortable when you engage on the grip. So from your grip he can go for a flying triangle flying. I'm lots and such. So crown was pressuring him. We doubting engage using the food and trying to make him feel like he has drew engaged, not grown grabbing. So that's kind of give the first, the first way for him to feel like lost.

Speaker 4:          01:56:07       He was expecting chrome to attempt but grown was pressuring without grabbing. If you see the fight again, you see so, and the one point they engage crumpled to the guard and uh, he was kind of trying to stay and couldn't go to the head ones he can escape and then chrome finish with the headlock as when the rule. But the guy is very tough. We are not worried about these Jujitsu back and forth like that tempts him to submit ground. Those are hard to catch because grown is very skewed to defend. But is he good at defending leg locks? Chrome? Yes, yes. But uh, still, uh, the opportunity was raised based on, he is his desire to act. So we forced him to act. He gave what we want and crunk catch precisely and sharp and was over every,

Speaker 5:          01:56:58       every morning. Every time I work out and go to the gym, I warm up on a stairmaster and I just go ADCC, Marcella, Darcy or whoever. And I just, I just want to warm up and watch people do Jujitsu at a high level. And that just gets my blood boiling and I just want to go lift weights. Right? So I'm watching a Marcello and crone and Matt recently, and I'm watching the last one. Yeah. And I haven't watched it in awhile, but man, I'm so used to Marcello just going through everybody. Marcella just brushes. He is unbelievable what he does. People go to his gym, he's like, hey, you can come to my gym, I'll roll with you, but we're going to videotape it and we're gonna put it on the Internet deal. And they're like everyone that goes, there's like, Oh Matt here. Like they're walking into the slaughter slaughterhouse, right?

Speaker 5:          01:57:46       He puts on a, everyone's going to see the role. So that's, and he just crushes everybody. Big dudes. And then for him, when he went against crone, he passed crones guard for a couple seconds. But then after that initial, he, it was a double leg dragon. He jumped in. And then crones ability to recover. Full Guard is unlike anybody I've ever seen. You rarely see full guard in Abu Dhabi. People stay away from full guard, but chrome will force uni, forest, Marcella Garcia and crone into full garden. Marcella was having a hard time and then he broke it, finally broke open his full guard, then he tried to pass again and then he's back and full guard again. And then, uh, um, crump, put them in a guillotine and the word is, and Marcel I think admits this, he went out, like he went out to him and he said, Whoa, that

Speaker 4:          01:58:37       almost best south. And then, but grown he, because it going in the end off the mat, the first, like the round, he was trying to save himself for it for the next round. So he, he put pressure and then he kind of said, dad, I kind of just try to hold instead, keeping putting all my power. So, and then, I mean, nothing happened and the guy kind of survive and he kind of won. But you won on a take down so that it could have, he could have put them to sleep there if that's possible. I mean it's, you know, but that's always the thing with the guillotine, knowing whether or not to exert all your energy and gas, you're honest, but crony, specializing the guillotine. I mean, he coming in the next for the next, for the lest Abu Dhabi prepared to, to, to face Marcel again. And here's this guy, Laney, his progress is being very, very, you know, progressive. And um, and uh, he was ready, but fortunately Marcel didn't, she didn't come and he made great fights and he displayed like, especially the good routine against Tanu. [inaudible] what's great in the final, the guy just when he jumps, and I feel like you guys talking about this fight and about the chicken

Speaker 5:          01:59:50       [inaudible] it. At first I didn't believe it. I'm like someone explain it to people who didn't hear our other podcasts. Well, what chrome, when in 2013, Abu Dhabi crone showed up and did with, with what only I think maybe, uh, John Jog did it. Marcella did it and I think maybe Hodgett Gracie did it. I'm not sure that he went in and submitted all four of his opponents and in the, uh, he, he submitted Gary Tonin in an amazing match with guests. Last fight I saw. Incredible. Yeah, it was incredible. I was losing my mind watching that one. And, and he submitted JT Torres, who's a beast, j d tours. So good. And he got them from the guard. He got it. He just had the overlook and he just flipped his leg over his face and just held onto the over. Cause it was kind of like one of those over hook arm bars and, and then he beat a, who did he beat first? I don't know. But the first

Speaker 4:          02:00:42       one was like a, I'm not sure his name, but he put a guy to sleep and then get this Gary Guy and the first day. Yeah. And then join the second danger

Speaker 5:          02:00:51       and then I'll tell me on the finals, well the match we're talking about and me and Joe talked about this and they made a, Stewart Cooper made a film on it, but Oh Tevya Sousa. His strategy was to not be honest back, stay on top and just kind of maybe get a takedown late, you know, cause that's a, in that rule format or that points format in Abu Dhabi that that happens a lot. People will just Russell and Russell and Russell and uh, he wasn't engaging. And crone is like, like just like Hixon saying, he's like Marcello. He's like, he goes after it, he's going to go 100%. All he wants is the submission. That's cronies, especial grappler, special fighter. All he wants is the submission. And Oh, Tevya wasn't really engaging. And as a father, no, no, no, not as a fire.

Speaker 4:          02:01:40       As a coach. I saw his coach as the fight progress. The guy saying [inaudible] Portuguese. Okay man, that's it. That's all you want. Okay, keep going. It's perfect. Perfect. Perfect. And I see a guy just running from the fight in making strategy, which kind of upset me completely. I mean there's nothing perfect on dead in my sense. And, but in the strategic aspect of He's, he's, he's doing so I have to counter in somehow and then I start to make sure, try to suggest the referee. He was escaping. He was try to avoid the fight because it's not positive points in the first 10 minutes, but it's negative points. So I was hoping for a negative 0.2 with dot. Well followed. This is stalling. So, and then I start to say [inaudible] the guy stature moving like you know, he don't want to engage you. It's just moving back like a chicken la, la La la La. And as the thing starts, you're boiling. I start to say, hey mountain sky like a chicken and the whole stage was this quiet watching the fight is just this noise kind of overwhelming. It's like throwing a chicken inside in a for a Jujitsu competitor. First of all.

Speaker 2:          02:02:53       I mean I know you're, you're right here but I just have to be honest. Everybody says you're the greatest ever. You're the greatest Jujitsu competitor of all time. So you are here the greatest Jujitsu representative of all time. Your son is competing. This guy has to respect you and admire you and your

Speaker 4:          02:03:09       going Bock, bock, bock, bock, bock, bock and the whole crowd is listening to this. I mean that's a lot of pressure on that guy. How to get into his head because in his book, because I was suggesting the referee, he needs should be punished and eventually like with 90 minutes or so, he get minus points and that's what's exactly what generates him to say, okay, now I'm hunting, be raw honey running behind. So I have to make it happen. And as we talk and afterwards we've grown, grown said dad, when I do start, you're talking like a chicken. I felt like he wanted explore them. I don't want to make a mistake wasting the opportunity, but I know he will come. He so I was just ready for it. So we kind of working together, you know like it wasn't a father and son Warren was perfect.

Speaker 4:          02:03:54       He shot right in and then he's already waiting for boom is over. Go home. Oh it's ice cream. That's one thing. That's the one thing John Jack would tell me, cause train for John. Jock obviously trained me from metamorris and we would talk about crone and and John Jack said, I asked John Junk, what is crones best technique? He goes, man, that guillotine, he wraps his arms around your head. He's got an incredible squeeze. The guillotine used to be a strong man move. Like I used to think of like even the arm and guillotine like that's a strong man. I never got into guillotines but over the last 10, 15 years they've gotten so told him, I said, um, I'm always been trying to specialize myself in all the submissions

Speaker 3:          02:04:38       and I have my good routine, which you know, giving me some victories, but you know, and then one day at one time I was talking if grown on, it's not even on the, on the mat was in the locker room. And then I said, yeah, but you know, team and you have the guy can escapes at an old dead, those Inchcape. I said, no, it's Kevin. I said, hello? He said, no, if I get it. I said, I'll come on, man. Grabbed me, man, I tap you. And then I have to rethink my whole strategy said, yeah, this guy has, you know, he's already have something to tell me. His levels of squeeze right is the level of grip is a level of grab. The way you hold is all technical and these did regular escape doesn't work anymore. So of course we have escape for crones, Cha Guillotine, but it's a different than I was visualizing.

Speaker 3:          02:05:26       So I have to learn how to escape from Everage guillotines and Crohn's guillotine. So it has to be special. The defense, those levels, the technical levels are lost on a lot of people that are just watching it. The differences, subtle variations. That is the essence of Jujitsu. I believe the beast, the biggest aspect of Jujitsu is invisible. My, I pray I'm in I my, my, my, I preach the invisible Jujitsu because easy visible because you see it but you don't see it. You see the same guide position. You see the same amount, but you have to feel it. You know, I, I base my Jujitsu and how you feel, not what you see and that's just totally different. When I go in the seminars and stuff, the guy feel different. They say, wow man, I've been doing this all my life and I never felt this way.

Speaker 3:          02:06:17       So, so good though. Okay. There's so much leverage. So, so based on the way distribution base on the, on the, on the sense of, of leverage in, Oh this can change at the same position you've seen a picture cannot be worth it or it can be very much effective depending how the grip, the angle, the elbow, the, the weight. So it's amazing how the visible Jujitsu is what really supports the, you know, it's not what you learn superficially. What do you think about Marcella Garcia is variation of the guillotine. He that [inaudible] some people call it a high elbow team and lot of people call it the Marcella tin where he doesn't believe like, like this. Yeah. What have you, is that part of something that you've taught her? Is that new to you know, he's not new is an option which developed by him like he is, he's the master on this, not, so you see different submissions from the brag. Yeah. Ambition. So it's adaptations, you know, Eh, if you focus and you know what's coming and you have defenses, I don't believe a good routine is effective regardless. No. Yeah. All they give the teams you can defend, but you have to be precise. If you make one mistake, if you're thinking about defense one and the guy come in with a little twist, the difference one's not going to work. And if you think about change for the second you already tapping, are you already sleeping?

Speaker 4:          02:07:36       Yes. So you have to be precise on, on the adaptation of each. So now we've grown, gets me, I know exactly what I have to go. If I delay five, two seconds, then going to over yeah. Is over. So, and that's, this goes for any, any technique. There's so many different ways to squeeze the neck. I would off the top of my head, you know, including all the arm in a chokes, like the Darce and the Japanese Necktie, the arm and Kia teen, the different grips, all these different net cranks. There's gotta be just those on the nosy, various ones. Like how, how, uh, how you call the, the neck brace from like the one, the twister. Yes. Yes. That was not really a chunk then that's just straighten that. Yeah. But there's so many ways, just know [inaudible] there's so many ways to, to put someone to sleep.

Speaker 4:          02:08:24       I would say there's 15 to 20 different ways Nogi to squeeze the neck. Everyone's got their own different stops. Did you get into, cause one of the most popular chokes over the last 10, 15 years in the, in the Nogi grappling seen is the Darce are you familiar with, what is the dose like? Bravo choke. It's the, it's a bravo joke. It's a squeeze, but it's the arms back. No, no. From top sites. Like yes, I'm going to half guard like and half guard. And you come in and it's like you have an over Hook and you'd come and raise that one. That's become just the one of the most basic standard chokes. And it came sort of from a wrestling a three quarter Nelson, a technique that was used to fly people over. And then, uh, uh, I think it was Dave Terrell showed it to, uh, Joe Darcy and then every mark layman's started calling it Joe Darce because he learned from Joe Darce but he, he actually, I don't know John Danaher there's a whole story but the name stuck to Doris.

Speaker 4:          02:09:24       Um, was that something that you guys were doing back in the seventies and eighties? That's more of a newer church and the people understanding the origins of the triangle, like just the leg triangle. Uh, there's so many different theories on where, how that got injected into a Heleo style and like do, do you know the origins of a tribe or is it just an old journal technique? No, I mean you feel going to hold the book techniques, you're going to see all the submissions, you know, like, uh, the application of triangles in my life. It started Chicago me by, by my understanding the concept and seeing that Longo guys like a Maca home guys and we've long legs like Maca, how, who was the car? My husband is like old school guy, old school. I saw guys doing this and I start to apply, you know, I start to you, my legs are not too long, so I have to pick the perfect position to do, but I start to get, you know, familiar with and I, man, it's just, you know, it's hard to say where it come from, but it's, I have, I have my open mind, like

Speaker 3:          02:10:34       the Eric Postel situation with the new, I always have, I opened mine, chew a Psap, chew twin brace, stinks. Our functional, you know, and discard everything, which I don't like it, you know, it's not about theory. It's not about, it's about effective and is about results is about, phew, phew. Comfortable there. So anything I see, no matter if it's from Bruce Lee or from any rest or a catch catch gun, or if I see an I like and I want to be going experiment immediately because I just edge my arsenal. You know, that's the concept, uh, which leads shoe to development, to, to, to progression and to success.

Speaker 1:          02:11:11       It's one of the beautiful things about Jujitsu is that it's constantly growing. There's always new techniques. The idea that the Darce choke wasn't around when you were competing and now it's a staple mainstay. It's fascinating. I'd have to bring this up because if I didn't bring this up, everybody online would go crazy. There's a video tape of when Yogi Anjo showed up at your Dojo and you, you, you know, you saw it. No oil. No, I've never seen it. No, he didn't say let's make the next barbecue and my house definitely wanna sit planet the world wants to see the world wants you. Will you, will you release it to the world? Probably eventually. Oh No, you gotta release it. That's one of the number one things that people are, and when I hit a couple of, of people on my site, I may do that. We'll do a free on the side. Make that happen. I won't make that happen. Tell us that story. How did that story come about?

Speaker 3:          02:12:03       Oh, just when I finished the valley to the 95, uh, was a legit eight men tournament and I won. Um, he started the, uh, like the WWF in like as a Ufo in Japan, was very strong with pro pro wrestling, like big magazines, like a huge Japanese love pro wrestling. So, and then based on that kind of exposure of this new event, the champion off the rest of the SOC, one of the champions off the UFO called Takada. I start to talk, you know, I like to fight The Hague. They ask him and they statue talking like all the pro wrestler stock, I going to kick his ass, this and that. It's not, you're talking, are you going to gossip? And at this point I'm back to La, maybe after two or three months off, this kind of talking around my name forever. Some guy, some, some, one of the friends I have in Japan, they come, he said, Mister Greece, they talking a lot about you.

Speaker 3:          02:13:02       He, you should have an official answer for that. You know, you cannot just let, because people will start thinking you afraid people. So you have to have official answer. So I said, okay. So I make a lattice stating, um, I was never, we'll fight on their ringing because they not legit. They fixed fights. So that's against my, if they, if you want to come and fight in my event, like the nine mine, but the event I fight and then Japan open, he will welcome to Carmen. We want face each other for sure. If other gays we can find even on the street. But I'm not there to fight on his event because that's who the paradise, my real fights status. He real fighters stairs. So with this being said, Cup, I might, maybe few weeks later, that guy that went out of the, the, the, the, the, the gossip and then owns your show up in the magazine.

Speaker 3:          02:13:54       Static he stature saying he will come into La to beat me up. He will do this because, because he said, oh, he's going to fight for free. So I wanted there to fight to kick. So in Dev guy commit and Mr [inaudible], he said this said, man, I cannot just lost my sleep based on his own on justice speculations. You're not. He did. He said when I come now, he didn't said, okay, so I want to keep my life and if you show up, okay, he show up. So best may be couple of weeks or so, even more. One day I was in home in the morning, my assistant at the school called me said Hixon some guys, yes and Japanese guys are here waiting for you. I want to talk to you. And immediately I figured it out. Could support, could be that situation. So I put my camera in my hand.

Speaker 3:          02:14:43       Hawkston wants to come in with me. He was about 11 years old. Um, I was going back, driving my car, taping my hands because I know when a B, so I was putting tape in my hands as I driving the freeway. When I arrive I saw like a van full up with photographers outside, you know, like the, I pass him through my parking lot and I saw him four of Jap on news with gamma, four of reporters inside. So I went through, when they get in school, I saw a huge, like a tall Japanese guy, very well dress it and the lady and I need that. The Hey, how are you? Oh, Mr Gracie, I'm the president of the Ufo Association. I come here to officially invite you to participate on a fight in Japan. I said, man, you crazy. I told you I don't want to fight in Japan.

Speaker 3:          02:15:36       And then their your association and then the onsite when I kind of deflect the direction. He said, yeah, but you also said you'll fight for free for your owner in. I said yes and he had to fight. They specked fighting you but you come into to negotiate. No, no, no. By the fight there is outside. Can you come? He coming? He said, yes, he can come me. So I tell my student, just say, Hey, you have a standard door. Let the lady with the fighter commune. But don't let the reporters come in, block everybody outside. I didn't know what's going to happen. I don't want to press. So as angel come in with black at ugly face and attitude and stuff, I immediately asked my structure, said Lumon grabbed the waiver and tell him to sign. It's like a, if I get hurt, whatever those waivers.

Speaker 3:          02:16:25       And so he looked the waiver we fugly face and then he spoke with, uh, with his guy in Japanese. And then the Japanese guy said, Mr Gracie, you mean if he don't sign, you don't fight? Immediately I felt like if I say, yeah, he has to sign, they may leave and they're going to come in. We followed the excuse, oh, he chicken out wherever, la, la, la. I immediately said, no, forget the paper. If you come into a fight, let's fight. If I get the bureaucracy, let's, let's make something here more simple. So, and then he's, he come into the mat, should they ring? I, you know, we, and we start, you're fighting immediately. I felt his intention to hit me immediately. I clinch put him on the ground and the statue pine she'd done back, but different than a normal event where just put him to sleep or whatever.

Speaker 3:          02:17:24       And that particular case I have to display, showcase his punishment. So I was not happy just to put him to sleep. So I start to hear to him and with their elbow, respect him to time. Eventually he don't and I punched him in the face and two broke his nose and make it all bleed, all cut a cut up. And at that point when he felt like I felt like he was just smash a knife, he turned again backwards and I put him to sleep and then I let him sleeping on his own blurred. And then I said to the, the press and okay now let them in. So when the press come in, saw him passing out, waking up with the guy trying to hide his face from the pictures and the guys all Dz waking up, all blurred, you know, big, big mass of blood in the floor and stuff.

Speaker 3:          02:18:16       And the crowd, my students can lift me up, I cannot make my tee shirt is all bloody and I kind of hang on the, on the wall like a trophy and a staff and we all yelling. So the guy stood up and left and then like three or four days later, and you'll come back to me and uh, at the my school I was teaching, he called me with a package and said, oh, I like to talk. He was still like all brews and stuff. So yeah, I like to apologize and, and actually give you this as a gift. And he gives me a Samurai helmet and a, and then he laughed to Japan. And when he got there, he say to the crowd, he was jumped, you know, I was John the guys jumped me out a lot because of the press didn't saw.

Speaker 3:          02:19:02       And then I get my, my assistant, my Japanese guy who's working with me and the valley to the 95. And I said, listen, you woody, you take this tape, you go to Japan, make a press conference display, don't make one copy nothing. Make sure no, no plea. So gold there, make shoulder depress and come back and bring this back. Okay. So he went make the conference and then my reputation when they saw was like a free for a fair fight. And what happened, my reputation went to this, to the roof. And uh, you know, he's just a big step for me and the like in the publicity because I capitalizing all the wrestling, publicity, which is national in Japan. So, and then, then my next fight eventually was we Staccato, he accept the fight and make official fight and then we create the pride. I help in the formulation of the rules.

Speaker 3:          02:19:56       A lot of folks don't know that you were a big part of the original pride. Yeah, they asked me if I want to fight the Cada and for that they want to create a new event. I said yes, I fight him and then we discuss numbers and in, in order to make a good rule, I help in the rules because you know, Ken cannot be, so I introduced the Globes and the MMA and the mixed martial arts. And the first one it said that we have to put gloves because without glue can beat your bloody, we have to cut head butts and stuff. So I make like a, a draw of the, the, the backbone of flood could be. And then from that they start the pride I fought the pride one, the pride for, and then the pride becomes like huge in Japan and then because they have a little involvement with the Coosa uh, the diff, the sponsors, they have Fuji TV like pull it off and they getting problems to, to the payroll, which is huge to have maybe 50 top athletes making a lot of money so they could not handle it down.

Speaker 3:          02:20:54       UFC come and they go over and get all the footage and the fighters and now links to a next level. They took a huge bath cause UFC page $65 million for pride and all, all the contracts were fake. Yeah. They're all void there. There are invalid rather than none of them were legal. So I didn't know that she had the worst of it. They are weighed the worst of it. They tried to sue Japan or they tried to sue the

Speaker 1:          02:21:18       organization. While it's kind of funny, this is how crafty they were while the UFC purchased a pride, the people that were running pride, we're starting another organization while they were working for the UFC. So they were working for the UFC, running the pride offices for the UFC in Japan, but then they were running their own interests is without know, with Disney, God of everything. Now there's, there's a Japanese style, there's a classic, there's a classic match or not a match fight that got, that's on video. I might be on youtube with Healon Hugo Duarte leaving the guy on the beach where you guys are fighting. What is that on Youtube. Oh yeah, yeah. Parts of it. It's hard to see the whole thing. The Gracies action. They must fight on the beaches. You know, who was holding the camera that day? Who was highing cousin with 12 years old and hawks and was seven John John was there. There's John Jog running. So what, what, what, what was the reasoning behind that fight? How did that go down? Okay, let's make this the last day. All right guys, because if not, they're going to talk forever. He had about things from the past you to talk

Speaker 3:          02:22:26       about present. But anyway, was a great time because at this point [inaudible] was just finishing fight. Fernando, uh, Fernando Pin Daca. And I in a event after my second fight off Zulu in Maria, uh, this Jujitsu community has a little friction with the loot delivery community. So they set up a fight between, uh, was Marcel bearing against a fabulous Molina, uh, Hennen against oceanic that deal and then a pin Duca against Michael Hula. And they draw and after that draw Mako who are, creates a good status off being a great fighter as it is. He's a good, you're not tough guy and the gossip starts, you'll become like, uh oh. And then people maybe ask him, what about Hexion? I said, hey, so, and they're kind of small word is a position where mark, who was as willing to fight me. And I also, of course we need to fight him, but I don't want to wait or give him the reputation where I challenge him is not the case.

Speaker 3:          02:23:40       He was just the first, I was already famous, established. He was already a coming up. Like just make a good fight. So to make things more simple, my f my father, myself, Marcello, in Sandra, my best friend, we went to his school and a day and a nighttime, he had maybe 50 guys training without Ge. They all tough. They all have a lot of pumping out to Ireland. So they all big guys, you know. So I went to his place, he said, who is I like to talk to you? So he come into me and said, hey man, I heard you use sport you to showing desire to fight me. So I like to fight too. Anytime you want, regardless, let's do it. If you want to do now you can do tomorrow, whatever. And he look at me and said, yeah, but it's not like that.

Speaker 3:          02:24:29       If you challenge me, I may accept but I have, I need four months to train. I said, man, you crazy. You think like I, I use all the names. But it's like you think the Lakers, we challenge a college basketball team from, from from Cucamonga, right? Fuck man. What you're talking about, you've come here to Charlie. I'd met, I come here too because I heard you planning to fight and if you find here you want to fight or not. So when this conversation statue become a little, my dad called me has a a mediator and said, hey guys don't, don't want to discuss, let's make a list if somebody wants to fight. So let's make a list and then eventually you guys can can fight and then we'll go from the back. Yeah, you can put my name on that list and I, first time I saw her in my life and I look at him, I said, yeah man, you tell me I, this is not a, because has a game, a gambling in Brazil, like a popular game, not official but unofficial game called Juggle to be shoe means game off the animals.

Speaker 3:          02:25:33       You put a name, a number, like a 24 is the, is the deer. So a guy put a $1 and if he wins again maybe $50 something very popular at every in every corner has this kind of underground game. And I said to him, this is not a game of animals, man. This is just a seat as business. You don't have to put your name in the least. If you want to fight, let's fight right now. And the guy kind of get me noodle, confused, sows and nothing happened. And then we decide to leave. So we left after that, the whole Gospel, every corner I heard Uga was straining to fight you. Woo. Start to force talking about woo. And I felt like this has to have an end. You know another guy who could not challenge officially because he's a nobody, but he's the guy who if I just disregard is something we're going to be against me too, because I know he has the potential.

Speaker 3:          02:26:28       He's a fighter, he just don't have the name. But he's a legitimate tough guy. So based on that, I could not just ignore and I could not challenge him officially. So I have to do something in between which fight him on the street. So we decided to find a final, okay, let's make a profile where he goes, what beats you go where he walks about. So we decided, well, he goes into this beach was a very popular beach and in real every Sunday, every Saturday, Sunday is there with the, okay, so next Sunday we want to be there Saturday.

Speaker 3:          02:27:04       So I was at this point, separate from my, my relationship, I was living like a, a single in real and that's very hard to do because a lot of options. So, so I was not concerned about the fight at all. I was no sleep on the Monday, Tuesday, like just going Pyree a lot, wake up on Wednesday, kind of afternoon walk on his street, close to my neighborhood. And then I saw a friend of mine who is always in the gossip said, hey, as a living home, I said, I think I'm going to postpone who was fight for the following week. I don't think it's going to be a good idea because man, I'm just too much party when I get on the street. Men, first time my first guy I saw it was this, my friend Bodu who's just come in and said, man, you should see the everybody's spread.

Speaker 3:          02:28:01       Bet everybody if talking about the fight, that would be great. They are waiting, they all will be there. And I say, Oh my God, no postponement anymore. I have to go regardless. So, so as I approached the weekend, I try to just recover, sleep, eat well, but still like not enough. Anyway. Uh, Saturday morning we all gathering in the end the Gracie Baha Academy, which is close to the neighborhood. And, and uh, we guarantee like the students, because we have to have a team shoe to be there, you know, what you hold and whatever. So it's about 50 to 60 guys there and we all kind of strategizing, okay, you guys make this and that. And um, and then my son was seven years old, old pumping up and down, and one point everybody quiet. He's just jumping the middle. I said, yeah, and if he son will be dead, I gonna kick his ass.

Speaker 3:          02:28:55       I said, so he's already with the DNA of the battle. So it was funny. And then eventually about 10 o'clock or so, he arrive on the beach. The guide, the message icon is age. They are. They're so, so you went to the beach and as we approached the beach, I have the camera. Nobody wants to hold the cam. No, no, no, not me. So I give the camera too high and which is 12 years old at the time and he could not get through is just yelling. Everybody who could not get through to film the fight. The funeral is not even important. So we engage was a at the moment the first engage after a slap him, Eh, we engage very quickly and then we start to house on the sand. He fall on top of me. I was kind of having a hard time from, from the beginning and then able to sweep mounted and he escaped from the Mt.

Speaker 3:          02:29:47       One more time because the scent giving me no bs. So I kind of mass my knee on the sand. So he come up, I have to sweep him again. Mounted again that time. Much more concern of keeping the position. So I grabbed his hand like, like from the back and I started punching him like a full Inaki. Yeah, exactly. Like flank at sash touch with punching him, punching, elbow, punch, batch, punch, punch. And then at one point I was dead, dead tired. I asked him, you want to give up? He said, you have to kill me. I said, okay, mother. Boom, punching, punching, punch. And then immediately afterwards he says, okay, stop, stop, stop. So I immediately stopped. We went to the water dive on the water has come back as we come back. He said, yeah, I'm not happy. I said, okay, let's do it again.

Speaker 3:          02:30:35       Said, no, no, not today. And I said, okay man. That's okay. And then how's with state? You're fighting you my cell. Mandy's at the beach, they start, you're getting it down. It doesn't have the end is just kind of mess it up a little bit. Hanzo confront with the guy, but it was not a hand fight. Anyway. I put stitches on my hand and a back, like all swallow my hands, all swallows. So I went back home, training, resting, giving my life. One week later, you know, I wasn't apart. A friend of mine, his apartment, you know, resting tired from some little fun. I was lay down, you know in my underwears my hair, I have long hair at the time, but all Massey a guy who my student of mine just stop in the bend, the on the, on the street on the bike and said, hey Exxon Hexion day inviting the school is invading is a big invasion. I said I kind of wake up in the run down and when he saw me running underwears you go like that and said hey man, I jumped in the bike, let's go. So I went to the, to my school in your underwear, in my underwear with the hair. All crazy things to be animated by the way. Right. And I, and as a approach the, the school, because they come in from a different neighborhood walking and, and one of the guys like [inaudible] was a black guy who lives in a ghetto

Speaker 3:          02:32:04       as they approached the Comey walk if maybe five, three or four miles, you know, something like that to a different neighborhood. They coming like from the street. That's breakout hustle as they coming like cause not only fighters as bad guys guys, we like all the ice. I mean only the co uncover eyes. We've with guns, with knives we've bottled break. So it's a lot of covert actions, a lot of average bed energy. Not coming from a real fight situation but it's more like a street dangerous. So as I approach and I come in through the crowd, which is already controlling maybe two thirds of the street, which paint passing cars just could not pass in cars anymore. It's just like just the car passing and a very fine line. It's a big crowd in front of the school. So I went through with the bike.

Speaker 3:          02:32:52       When I coming up to the school, he's already coming down with my father, the new song, which his a struct or other guys. They coming down and we, we kind of crush each other. And in the middle of this, the stairs, I said okay man, let's go down, let's talk. So we can went down to the parking lot and like crowded maybe 20 guys from my school. One guy has a weapon, but the other guys may be five or six, 10 guns and knife. I mean, he's a bad, bad weather, you know. So before I start the fight, I said, Ooh, I like to talk to you. Come over, let's talk. Let's walk to the backyard here. So my father and myself, the new Song Heuler and the Oceania to deal, we kind of move away from the crowd that you were like a backyard. And I said, man, I want to talk to you. Something very important. Listen, I fought to you last week as a man and I come here, I respect you as a fighter to challenge me to rematch. So all of this, the school, regardless who, when, who lost. But if somebody touched the fight before the fight is over, because you bring here a lot of people without no martial arts code. So if somebody touches the fight before it was over, I guarantee you, man, you wake up on the ditch.

Speaker 3:          02:34:14       And he said, no, no, he's a man meant you man. There's a spice as the owner thinks, okay, let's go back. Let's talk finish books. So we went back to the crowd, they make a a Rina like people make a real uh, circle and was on the concrete and I felt when we start it, I felt like his mentor or whatever she was supposed to say to him, hey man, the first fight last week, you engage too quickly, you give the grappling to, you should punch him in the face. So I felt a completely different animal because he was already trying to buy his approach, his position, he's the way he moves. I felt like he wants to punch me different than was before and I kind of make myself like available. I kind of played dummy, you know like play kind of stretch and he come in, punch me right that I deflected very quick, grab him around the waist, like high, make a little hip movement and put him on his own and throw him on the concrete.

Speaker 3:          02:35:13       So He fell flat on the concrete. I tried to mount hitch escape, I move like to the other side and mount again and I ended up by mountain on him. Like we're 15 maybe 20 seconds I use is mounted on him. I punch the cover up and I could not punch anymore. So I get his everything and Bang his head against the concrete few times. You're not going to bang their head on the floor and then he's soft it up a little bee. I give them a couple of pints. He kind of quit immediately. Stop, stop, stopped. For me it was not exactly the well done job because it was just too quick. And he, he, he quit. He quit very quickly. So I want to do something else. But the crowd was already trying to, it's too much. I said, if I insist here after his Rx, ask for mercy can jeopardize the whole thing.

Speaker 3:          02:36:05       So even though I was not happy, I stood up and he stood up and he said, yeah man, I'm happy. I'm satisfied now he would really demand shake your hands, said yeah man, you have a very valuable guide shoe with very strong keep training, you can be good. So we kind of ended up our it, our our different, yes. So once we out of that highly statue, uh, highly start to fight the urogenital deal in the same because they are already having a little, so they start, you're fighting at that point the police come in, a guy with a gun machine just because nobody would listen to possess is nothing. So he cannot make a shooting. The the roof, the bullets come up and breaking some, some Rico shit down and somebody get hit and then he come, he was very small guy with a cigarette and said, hey, why not? See who is the tough guy now, now. And so it's like very small guy for gum machine. So he knew everybody like quiet. So, and then I talked with the new said, hey man, the fight is just start here with hydro has to go next week we're going to set up something that's not Andy and said, yeah, that's all we, we set up for a different day when then is over for me, we and what we kind end up with

Speaker 4:          02:37:16       are respectful, honorable way and uh, that's pretty much it. That's it.

Speaker 5:          02:37:20       Great Story. No more old stories. That's it. Because there are those all night. We can go forever here man. Some guys, you know, this is the biggest response ever on Twitter for a gas. Like, I don't know about your Twitter, but my Twitter people are going nuts that you're doing the podcast. People are losing their minds and they've been going nuts ever since the Yohji Angelo tape. There's screaming, please release the tape, please release the tape. Will you release it? Yeah, let's do that. Oh, the couple of million people in the site. We'll do our best to get as many people on the site. Where are you sending people? What's the site? What's the address? Jay Jay g f.com. Global Federation that call. So just the initial J J G f.com. It's all set up right now. Beautiful. So I wanted to ask you something about what's going on today

Speaker 4:          02:38:12       in MMA. There's like, like Nick Diaz and there's been a bunch of guys that have been, uh, suspended and fine for having a cannabis in their system. And there's big controversy because in a lot of states now it's 23 states in the United States where it's legal now. So how do you feel about a banning cannabis as a performance enhancer? Do you think? I mean, what do you, what do you think about it man? I think, you know, we are, I mean the, the beginning of the Times drugs are always involved with was not dressed drugs for body drugs or, or let's I totally talking about painkillers. We talking about coffee, we talking about alcohol, we talking about, I mean, Geez and Arabs and so we all luck. Wish to meet you use medicines and drugs. Tween. Hey. Should diminish to account too. So this is, is, is, is there, you know, I think, uh, that kind of judgment goes from person to person from, you know, some people can have a little bit of some drug and get a reaction which can make him crazy or can make him addicted or can hate him.

Speaker 4:          02:39:23       So the chemical in the brain can respond differently. Yes. For some people can I bust as a medicine, as they play fight all this can be a stimulant or it can be uh, uh, below. I mean low yourself. Steam becomes bipolar. If you smoke, you can be, I mean, I mean you don't know. It makes you more of what you are kind of right there. It's hard to say what is. So and that point I feel like we have to obey the law, you know? And if, if some kind of drugs are forbidden by law, for you to become a proact athlete, you have to obey that. If we not with Korea and what you're doing in your life, you know, it has to be respected. It has to be, you know, whatever. But what's the rules for MMA? I mean, I try to input in the Jujitsu, the anti-doping, you know, because you'll see guys in the same way division, but one guy has 10 times more, 10 times more power, 10 times or so.

Speaker 4:          02:40:22       And the guys that you know has the addictive, like he has a, an extra I extra iin Haysman so we have to balance this in art in order to make a fair sport. How much they can I be is affect the athlete. I'm not sure you know and but I know audits like steroids or hormones, those are proving so whatever is being proved against use the cannabis for fighting for e sports activities. If it's proved this kind of support of, I mean the drug use can be in hasting center. Maybe we could, I don't know. It's up to the prognosis. It's, it's their, they're testing people for something that stays in your body for a long time after its psychoactive. So if you took cannabis like a week before your fight, you're not going to be high when you're fighting but it's still going to be in your system.

Speaker 4:          02:41:16       So you're still going to be penalized for something that has like what's the reason? What's the reason why they took it? Yeah. Because you can have caffeine in your blood, you can have like a, another kind of why the cannabis has to be, because I don't think he's in haste. Mint of performance I think is only control your emotion. Emotional give you kind of some kind of feeling of happiness sometimes even give you like a little laziness, you know? I don't think that's what will help you as an athlete. I think if you get, if you get high before event, you're gonna lose your sharpness. You're going to, so I don't think that's will support. So I don't see why they have to bother in legalizing or four beats. I Dunno. Maybe it's just because of the law, just because it's illegal. And the reason why it's illegal has nothing to do with whether or not it's safe or dangerous.

Speaker 4:          02:42:06       Does nothing. It's all political at this point. So, but they did lower it right now. It used to be in a few of you, if you were in Colorado, let's say, where it's totally legal, it's not illegal there. Anybody can smoke in Colorado. You could buy it and you could buy it. And vending machines, you have to stop a month before your fight because it's, it's still going to show up in the test and you could lose the fight, the fight to no contest. You've get fine. So now they're, they're kind of changing it and adapting now I guess, uh, according to the numbers I think you can go, you have to stop two weeks before a fight or something like that. So, um, yeah, maybe eventually, depending on the card they have to change the fight for Colorado. Yeah. So the training camp be in, in Colorado, so everything that is legal, but there were, there are there definitely.

Speaker 4:          02:42:58       Uh, well, how do you say relaxing? The rules are, or he wouldn't say that though. What do they, what's the word he made it from a, used to be 50 nanograms per milliliter to 150. So it changed quite a bit. 300% increase. So you have to have 300% more marijuana in your system. That's a step in the right direction. Now, as far as performance enhancing, surfing is a serious sport that requires serious technique, lots of hours. And generally you, you, you hear that surfers will be under the influence of cannabis while they're surfing. Um, Eh, it wouldn't, it if it, if it doesn't, makes your reflex is some people believe that it makes, it's a dulls your reflexes. How can surfers, uh, be under the influence of cannabis and ride a 25 foot wave? No,

Speaker 3:          02:43:52       the, the, the way the ocean is, um, he's an animal, you know, he's alive is in movement. These can be dangerous. Has this kind of, you have to have the perfect lecture. [inaudible] you have to have it to Beth mapping

Speaker 4:          02:44:09       the way out, the way in. So He's a lot of strategies, a lot of technique and is also, is a lot of Armani between

Speaker 3:          02:44:18       you as a surfer in the ocean. So you have to find yourself comfortable. You have to find herself disputed to be connect to the force. And sometimes some of guys who, my friends who kind of normally, uh, smoke some, they feel peaceful and they get in the Armani. He's not, he's not about Stan News, uh, physical.

Speaker 4:          02:44:46       The only if you get caught in the bad situation, I guess the bad report, you have to swim like a dog. You're a good surfer. You've served your whole lives, right. So for my whole life, what's the biggest way of you've ever served 38?

Speaker 3:          02:44:57       No ma'am. No ma'am. I'm a, I'm about 12 feet.

Speaker 4:          02:45:01       Dangerous. Longboard shortboard shortboard okay. I'm a short board. Yes. And crone serves to grow surfs, but he is just, he is more passionate about Jujitsu then, then surf. Surf still. Oh, depends on swell. I have to check her for lunch today. Oh really? Yeah. Oh yeah man. What is it about surfing is about? Uh, for me is mod.

Speaker 3:          02:45:27       The water, the ocean. Because I believe in energy. I believe in, uh, in the ocean being the most, the most, the hugest and electromagnetic Paul in art or the electricity coming from. So as I go in the ocean, if I'm stressed, I get energy. If I'm, you know, lazy, I get energy. If I'm to tests, I get relaxed. So He's, I equalize it for me because I feel like the contact with the ocean keep me in balance. Keep me. So for me it's not about the perfect waves about going to the ocean and make my routine, make my exercise breathing. You know, I'm a tropical rat. I'm born and raised in so I cannot stay away from the water is just, you know, somehow the energy flow in the Holy Spirit spiritually. That's kind of have empower me in a sense that you would say that physically surfing does translate to Jujitsu as far as the balance, right, because you need incredible balance.

Speaker 3:          02:46:28       Not really. I think a, it is of course you, you stimulates your yard, your neural muscular activity in surfing and skate and, and Juju. But uh, I think the most important thing in surfing is as you become under pressure, you have to strategize. You have to be in control of your emotions. You have to be a focus in and everything due, right? And if things go wrong, you have to be fine. Your comfortable zone in hell. And that's the mindset. The similar because the ocean is not the only enemy, but he's there to do his tank and is very powerful. So you have to find her, your mentor, your mindset, you'll find confortable in all of this turmoil, you know, is all you know is if you get quite in a wrong position and if you get panic is gone. So you have to be calm.

Speaker 3:          02:47:23       Same thing than fight. You have to have like the focus, the strategy and uh, even when things, when the problem arises you have to be in control. What do you do with your time these days? Like what's a typical day for Hixon Gracie? Um, right now I backed, should teach and cross place because I want to, to, to have him dees, distress with the, how the academy goes. So I pick two times a week to teach. They're giving selfdefence glasses at this point. Before that I was doing seminars once a month at the most, once or twice every couple of months to make my living. And also because I feel like the best things in life, money cannot buy. And I feel like the quality of my, my, my meals, the way I eat, the way my relationship, my sleep, those are very, very valuable assets, you know. Plus the time I have to do things I love to do.

Speaker 3:          02:48:27       That's kind of when this is fuel. Like when I feel like I'm every, so I feel like I'm happy enough to be my best at service because I always tried to be at service, helping somebody with Jujitsu, with knowledge, with nutrition, with breathing. You know, it's not about the price is about the service, you know? And then I put my head in the and said, yeah, I have a nice day. I make a good speech. We've, Joe Hogan, I'd have a girl I spoke with at Bravo was great day. So somehow in a purpose for the federation. So I always try to be positive, but I have no schedule fix. Like I have to wake up vote. You wouldn't know because at this point I create a lifestyle which make me a few good to engage in different elements like this federation now and having glasses on crowns and be here to be full of energy.

Speaker 3:          02:49:22       You know, because sometimes you don't notice, but based on your, your, uh, your commitments, your obligation, you'll becoming more like a Robert and you, you, you lose the perspective of what you need to be at your best. And if you lose that perspective, even though you still doing your routine, sometimes you just minus you just 80, 70, 60% of what you should be. So you're not going to be the best husband, you're not going to be the best father, the best employer, the best employee, you just, you know, it's just, so at this point I feel like I have to be at my best physically do my, if I feel like I have to stretch, they're going to stretch, breed, joke, have fun, listen buddy, whatever, you know. And then when I feel like, man, I'm so happy I could not eat so, and then I can go and do my service, you know?

Speaker 3:          02:50:15       And you know, because the window of life is smaller now for me is becomes, I don't have too much time. So I don't waste time to do what people expect from me. I tried to do things. I read the relevant to my soul, like this federation now I, I when I dream I don't dream small. I dream like I make like a very space for a huge, the biggest dream I can dream. And I see that, you know, that level of, of need for the community and the level of, of position I have to be the reference for that shift in the direction of our culture, in our knowledge. I feel like I could not be more motivated, more happy to engage on this. So, and that's always life is about is just do your best and, and, and be excited to be motivated to, to, to the next day.

Speaker 2:          02:51:10       There's such a refreshing attitude. Your attitude, your, your philosophy on life because I think it's very easy and I've been, I've trapped myself in it sometimes where you concentrate too much. I'm making money, concentrate too much on being ambitious and you forget the quality of life. And you are focuses almost entirely on your quality of life.

Speaker 3:          02:51:28       Yes. You know, because like I said, and then how much cost your motivation, how much cost your friends, how much cost your health, how much costs, your intelligence, those things is priceless. I, man, if you take those off your life, you take on more vision of your life, can be Bill Gates can be the biggest. So if you, if you ask me if I want to have bill gates life, I don't know. I don't know him. So it's not a base on his bank account is based on how happy he is, how horny he is, how, you know, how, how, how motivated he is to wake up and do his thing. He don't look too horny.

Speaker 3:          02:52:08       So, so that's, that's a very essential thing, which sometimes sleep to people's fingers and, and the priorities in the daily, you know, in the payments. And so I put you in a role where, uh, I feel like, um, if you tell me in the past what's the core age, what's the opposite of courage? I want to see cowardness because either you tough enough to challenge and to fight or to Orin, Daniel cow and then you chicken out. So that's in the past was like the, the, the, the, the opposite of, of, of courage. It's very hard to measure this in those days and I believe the opposite of cordage should they use conformity, you know, is people get conformed, oh I don't like my wife the way I used to like, but I'm never going to divorce because I'm afraid to lose my house or the situation is so established so I want to keep, so I don't like this job, but I want to keep here because better than his.

Speaker 3:          02:53:06       So in, in, in other hands, the future, if you get quite on that kind of compromise to, to maintain because you were afraid to risk, that's keep you like one step behind from you, follow your heart, follow an ambition. You should 18 years old, you don't think twice. Like I said, hey, let's go to Australia. You think, okay, let's go boom. But when you fifth to sales training and what are they going to do there? Maybe I'm going to, so it's different, you know, and that's kind of hate or what's going on. Yeah. So that's kind of pretty much where keep you from be at your best because if you willing to sacrifice, if you will into two broke new new challenges. If you really chew you in stage of liveliness and excitement and unpredictability, who make you feel like you in heaven? You know, every time I was engaging in a compromise on a fight was something I, I think like I have my routines prior to fight.

Speaker 3:          02:54:06       One of them is at the day off my fight, I wake up and I thank you. Glad to be alive and I acknowledge how perfect we'll be that day. If I die today, say fuck my wasn't, it'd be a perfect day if I die because I have, you know, I accomplished my think. I'm in my mission, I representing my family. So I don't go that your tap, I go, that should die. Like I have to kill me. It's not, I'm, I never won at that. So, but that's not a spotlight orientation. This is a philosophical, uh, owner representation, you know, is not something I teach. My snow should not that, no, it's not like that is about how I feel, how I feed my kids, how I follow my tradition. So in engagement, I am not going to be the one who going to quit. Then I have to kill me.

Speaker 3:          02:54:52       My brother, he can throw the Tao. But for me is unacceptable. You know, I do give up from my life. So based on that kind of spiritual guidance, my life is very intense. My life is very, I mean, directed shoe accomplish give up is not an option. You know, I can do, I can direct my, my, my focus, I can give up from something to go somewhere else, but I never will give up from something because I feel like I cannot reach there. I may say, okay, that's not for me. I go somewhere else. But if I still focus, I will take those falls. I will take those obstacles as a motivation to just set up a new strategy to try again. You know, I'm very competitive in a sense. I like the perfection of things. So this is like a, a situation where put you in a situation where you have no, either you go forward or you don't, but don't stay in the middle. Don't say just waiting for people are waiting for more. Those are kinds of things going to stack you back in life and, and just make you feel like passing through life as you know, you have, you know, you irrelevant, you know, is, is very weak. It has a beautiful way to end this.

Speaker 2:          02:56:07       Thank you very much brother. I really appreciate it. Let's make this sometime again and absolutely. Thanks [inaudible] we can do this forever I'm sure and anything we could do to help your association. I'm 100%
