Speaker 1:          00:00:04       Five, four, three, two, one. The first man to smoke marijuana never really smoked it and held. It was a Chinese man. He was a very great man and whenever he lit the plant, it wasn't to get high, but he would start to get high and every time he got high, a blue bird would come to him and tell him to conquer his neighboring neighborhoods and he listened to those to the bird and that's exactly what he did and he became a great emperor in China at that point in the story. Pablo Escobar because his doctor and he goes, have you ever been to Disney land? And the doctor goes, no, Pablo, I have this very clean, very organized. Well that's it, but it's the truth. First gather Chinese dude that burnt the plant because he liked the smell of the plant and gave him a soothing.

Speaker 1:          00:01:05       But after days of doing it, it packed up in his body and he started to loosen that and he saw a blue bird. Blue Bird came to him and told him that he had to conquer the neighborhoods within a region or crazy bird. He got high and a bird started talking to them. What are you gonna do you know? Uh, I don't know if this is true, but this is one of the things that are the part of fishing Nana was always used to say is that, you know, when a priest walks down the aisle and they have that thing that they swing and there's burning incense inside of it. They used to be, we'd. That's what they used to do was to be in what dimension? I don't know. At one point, I believe it was, we got it became that shit that Batman shot at the Green Hornet like pedophile smoke. You, you wake up, your shirts bombed backwards. This shit. Your pants are missing.

Speaker 1:          00:01:58       Well, what did, what is it now? What kind of instances? It's smoke. I, I go in there, the church, every once in a while now you have to go for the full effect. One like the five in the afternoon on Saturday and the early morning Sunday they don't break out the incense that don't start breaking out the fucking Melaleuca fucking some kid and the guy comes out and when the guy comes out their own water, Jesus and then the other guy. It's so weird how somebody made a great point on twitter the other day. They said, you me, Mitch Hedberg, if there's five of us to deliver newspapers is $5. The delivered newspapers. You Hedberg did it? Yeah. You delivered them in a call the other places I was an asshole that took a route but not the route in my neighborhood. The route in the neighborhood over, so I had to beat the kids there before they get there and steal the papers. I would deliver them right to the doors and all. You did too and then you collected. I collected from only a handful of people. Most

Speaker 2:          00:03:00       people are on like a monthly subscription plan. They had. They were switching over, but the people that you'd have to collect from Yeley this envelope, like a tan envelope and you had to mark off like, you know when they owe things that I barely remember it because it was only a couple of the clients and after awhile I kind of got away from doing them. I said, I don't want to do these people that have because it's too hard to collect. It's annoying. Like I don't want to. I don't want to have to go to. That was I didn't like it must have been. That was just when I first got a Catholic school and my mom gave me an option that I had to go up there and work in the afternoon. I got to figure something out. I just don't want to go up there anymore and my friend said I'm giving up my newspaper route, but he didn't give up the one that my navel.

Speaker 2:          00:03:41       He gave up the one and the next city over the next town over that city. I could still walk day so I'd have to leave school run over there because of not the dude who steal my papers and sell them as their own, the fucking street corners, so I'd have to get them, put the circulars in, put them in a thing and then throw them on people's balcony and then on Fridays and Saturdays I have to go back with a ring after dinner and collect. How you doing Mr Rogan. I'm here to pick up seventy five cents and they give you like a dollar 50. That was your tip and you got like twenty two cents a week for the of the paper. Did you collect from everybody? I collected from everybody. I was this. What years were these? This has to be 73. Seventy four. Seventy five. Yeah. So I guess when I started doing it is when I started driving, which had been like 83.

Speaker 2:          00:04:34       I probably started 83. I probably started when I was 17. No, that was 85. 80 five probably. Then that's when I probably started doing it. Or you're too old to be collected. I wouldn't be either. Well it wasn't even that, it was just annoying, like what you wanted to do was go to the depot, pick up the papers, chuck them into the People's driveways and that's it. And then there was a few people that wanted it inside the door so you'd have to get out of your car, open up their screen door, put it in there and then leave. And the idea was that those people, everybody would say those people tip you better. Those two, Delta p Bennett Miller. Okay. And so we would only have like a few of those and I think after the first couple of years they stopped doing those kinds of collections or I definitely stopped doing them.

Speaker 2:          00:05:19       But it was an awesome job when you were like a young comic or you know, even before it was a comical and I was fighting, it was just a. I didn't have to do anything where someone was telling me what to do. I could get my car, I could listen to whatever I wanted to. I listened to Charles Laquidara, he had a, the morning the big mattress on, I think it was bcn. I'm pretty sure it's wbcn in Boston, which is awesome radio show. I listened to that. Chuck newspapers out windows. I do that for like three hours every day, you know? It was the best ever because

Speaker 3:          00:05:58       then I would make enough money where I could pay my bills, but I still had all the time in the world. You stand up

Speaker 3:          00:06:07       all the time, the world train all the time in the world do anything, but it definitely fucked me up because you're not supposed to be getting up that early every day. Like that can't be good for you. You know, if you listen to people that know things about sleep, like getting up at 4:30 in the morning or five in the morning every day and not being responsible. That was the beginning. To me. That was the beginning of the new Joe Rogan podcast. That was the first podcast I listened to that I agreed with a lot. What else? I had a couple of mitigating factors because I believe that everybody's body is a lot different. I know I could rock and roll. I could throw down on seventh street, but it's got to be seven straight. No, nothing. No. Get up the two times because once you're 50 it could be up and down.

Speaker 3:          00:06:56       See, once you turn 50, 48, everything changed his papa. So if you had night chicken come to it was. It has to come up throughout the night and you will be up all fucking night on the hour. Every hour. There's no rem sleep. There's no rem sleep. So you have to come control once you get old, you have to control your thyroid dog. I've been a specialist on asleep since day one. That was one of the most interesting podcasts you had. I bought the book and everything and he made some great points in there. I didn't. I wasn't raised under that. Joe Rogan.

Speaker 3:          00:07:31       My mom didn't raise me once we came from Cuba, my dad died. There was no nap. I went with. She went right. So Mike Day Consisted of eight to three in the morning. She had a manager's room in the back of the bar with a cop. If I got tired at one, go back there and take a nap, but I gotta stay here till three Momma got to work. Wow. So my sleep was always her and then when I was five or six in school that I went to normal sleep, I went to Catholic grammar school, normal sleep, everything was normal, but my mom had a bad thing that she did. My mom had an issue that a lot of parents don't do when they work nights. It was. She did it from the heart because I have a friend who does it. Wake you up at three in the morning, Joe Rogan, Joe Rogan.

Speaker 3:          00:08:23       Get up black ink and Pasta, which really from them burritos. And I brought you a newspaper. Are you fucking kidding me? Can you imagine if I woke you up and it to when you're 26 years old joe at 3:30 in the morning and you know I'm doing it from my heart and seven out of 10 times you're going to get up and eat the school. Julie or the or the Marinara Sandwich I brought you from Leo is because they worked in the city, so if you remember, if you bartending in New York City on the way home, he stopped. No, you stopped and get two slices of fucking the best pizza there isn't Manhattan. So my mom would wake me up every night at 3:30 in the morning with the Cuban sandwich that killed me over the years. That would make me get up every night at three. They're still nights that I'll be sleeping. I get a good night's sleep, but I'll look at the clock and it's 3:00 AM on the fucking died because it's in my. But like last night I slept good. I fucked up. My sleep was bad after I read the book for a while. That's how deep it got into my head. So when I went back to weightwatchers I realized I couldn't eat anymore fucking edibles because they wouldn't. They would make me hungry at night. I would fucking go off the charts with points. So I stopped eating edibles and Joe Rogan. My sleep pattern changed bad,

Speaker 3:          00:09:46       like my body did not know how to go to fall asleep by itself. I went through a month or two while I was asleep. Jesus doing with a bunch of shit and then three more hours. Yeah. Did you try anything? Did you try like Melatonin or anything like that? I did cocaine for 30 years and Melatonin the 23rd stick it all suck. My Dick Gaba, Gaba, google, Google. I drink them all together. The vine. Leave me alone. Please leave me the fuck alone. Fuck this. Awesome. I got something. That's Gaba, Gaba the tea and the trip depending put together and they still don't find. I buy it on Amazon. I'm bad. So what I learned to do was rotate it.

Speaker 3:          00:10:33       So now I'm back on the animals. I found that about an expired bag of Chiba chews, like the Dave Chappelle to when I went out with Dave and I found the bag with about 24. Oh my God. I slice them in half. You take one of those where you wake up at six in the morning. [inaudible] Brown expired. You understand me? What happened to me? IED expired edibles. Same thing when you eating expired Vikatin. Listen to this. Listen to this. Listen to this shit. Ain't fucking around though. This works. The jaw. This is. You got to fight Joe Schilling. He to have these copies back on Monday. Ain't ain't nobody knocking you out after he eat one of these times. Things don't put you in another dimension. My God, I've been in a fucking another dimension since last week and I don't give a fuck. I have not left the house in a week.

Speaker 3:          00:11:20       Do you understand me? I ate two of them on Saturday. I know you up at night or how beautiful though. Beautiful. Mangement. Tremendous. The nicest people. I took a bunch of really smart people that it, you know, fuck him. Fuck Portland. Fuck New York. Fuck Chicago. Take to get mad with blowing up boise. They want to keep it low key. They want to keep them low. Kids fucking all of those areas. You can ski up there. Ain't got everything up there. Nobody knows. Yeah. They got couple people that hate black people, but they keep on the side of the state. Mark Furman's up there, fucking Oj sister in law. You know what I'm saying? It's all right. It turned right. No, no, no. It's beautiful. Then you went to sign. My friend who I kidnap showed up your show. He said he had a great time. I go, why don't you say a little Brogan? You could have done a podcast right there.

Speaker 1:          00:12:13       You said he was embarrassed,

Speaker 1:          00:12:20       but Saturday night I paid the fucking edible Joe Rogan. I ate two of these expired ones. I eat one that I said, let me take a chance. It's Saturday night and a nother one and I noticed your movie was coming up and it is fucking what a phenomenal movie. Midnight Express. When they catch the kid coming back from Turkey with Hash on his body, Joe Rogan. That is one of the most hardest movies you ever fucking watch in the Goddamn the first 30 minutes of that like I thought I was going to die. Like when they let him go through and they played him and as soon as he hit the fucking plane, they turned them around, ripped his shirt, and they dropped in their hands and knees and they gave him the seven years and they started raping them. Jesus. But I watched up to the part where fucking he became friends with this dude. They had a cat and the dude name was likey likey like he was the guy's name and Leckie killed the cat and they let this American. Now you don't have point where even Michael Douglas and was that movie. He's on the four or five and he just snaps fighting back. Michael.

Speaker 3:          00:13:31       Then they tried to rob them. The three Mexicans try to rob him from the suitcase. What was that? Sorry? What was falling down? Falling. He had like his day like that was it. That was the last day to fucking live. This

Speaker 1:          00:13:50       finds that they killed that poor Americans cat and he throws a fucking beat on this left dude. Joe Rogan isn't one of the most disturbing beatings. There's too disturbing beatings or film history. That's number two because he closes it out because the guy was a rat,

Speaker 3:          00:14:06       so after he throws a beat man, look. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Right there. He spitting up and guy's tongue in the air and they showed it on. I gotta give a shout out. The Turner classic movies. You motherfuckers been growing heat the last six days they had on something else last night that the gambler on the other night that followed this. This is the 40th anniversary, Joe Rogan. He throws a beat man. Them opens his mouth. I'm thinking the guy's being a nice guy. He's going to give him mouth to mouth and saved the guy's life fucked low. You see him going and he just pulls up like this, Joe. They slow it up. Only I'll call fucking real director that on the waterfront last night. Jesus ain't fucking around. And they once I was watching like what is the commercials? And they said, fuck. One time I had my mother's will play this hand.

Speaker 3:          00:14:57       Now they're going to show the tongue. Joe Rogan. He takes it out. Did you could see the rage from the fucking eight years in a Turkish jail getting fucked in the ass? Eat that Hummus, drinking that fuck them watered down tea from Korea and he just spits his fucking look at this. Beaten the best beat in of all time. There's only one better beaten. Our board a Mexican when he beat up a pilot. This is Leptin. Jesus. Dude, I forgot about this move. This is a classic. This is a classic seventies movie. This is crazy, dude. Look at him. He's just. This is eight years of getting beat up every day. I'm not. I'm gonna fucking kill you. You fucking fuck dude.

Speaker 3:          00:15:51       This is an intense scene. What year is this moving? Seventy eight. I was a kid. I still remember going to see this in the movies. I'm leaving. They're like dog. I ain't ever gone to Turkey. Jesus Christ. The scene for the people that are just listening. Um, he's, he's tearing apart this bathroom to get it. This guy, I don't remember who the guy is. He is the guy that sells more than down hash and he rats you out and he's just a creepy fucking dude, and then to finally push them over to tap, he hangs his hat. He wakes up to his cat being hung and right here people. This is the fucking strength of the seventies. Balls to the wall. Oh, smashes. Yeah. No, this is real deal. Real right here, Huh?

Speaker 3:          00:16:42       Oh Shit. Are you fucking nuts? Good morning. Here's the fourth of July. You're fucking with an American motherfuckers. Even in Turkey, we lose our fucking minds. That guy must've been half Armenian when he bit his tongue out. There you go. Dude. This was. This guy. Ended up dying of AIDS in real life. This is a strong, strong. Next time you had guy was a real life guy in this guy. The actor. Who was he? What was his name? I forget what his name. Brett. Brett. Brad Davis. Jesus. Then the second best beating is our man Anthony Quinn. At the end when he was 80, he beat the shit out of the good looking dude for fucking his girl friend, Mariel stope. Madeline stowe and a movie called revenge that. Oh yeah, I remember revenge. Kevin Cost Kevin Costner and then he slices a face and he fucking put your in a whorehouse right? Fucked in the ass every hour on the hour. Fucking this is it. It's a fourth of July. Get his shit

Speaker 2:          00:17:50       together. You know what I'm saying? If Alex Jones is correct, we'll go on and have a civil war today. So what the fuck you talked to Alex, you've got to calm them down. Alex. you gotta calm down talking about a civil war. He had me doing an extra achievement. Judy the other night I was polishing the fuck and the musket. Alex thinks I'm defending the new world order because I didn't think that George Soros was a Nazi. It's also painful. What's up Joe? Rob? Nothing. What's happening brother? Everything's great, man. I mean, I feel good. Alex Jones. I love you buddy for real. But you say some silly shit. That's where this all comes from. It doesn't mean I don't love you. You're a great guy, but there's some shit that's just silly. It's wasted time. You know? That's one of those things, it's just a waste of time. Does that make sense? I'm with you. I think there's real conspiracies, you know, but I think there's some that, you know, people just get caught up and looking for conspiracies and everything and after a while it's exhausting.

Speaker 2:          00:19:01       Let's get the ball off the table. I love the guy with the podcasts with already last week, yesterday, 18 attorney's son. Alex Jones going to hear that. So I'm just like, I'll finish. Okay. I'm so sorry. No, it's okay. It's just, I love the guy. I really do. I just don't support a lot of the shit that he said. Like the sandy hook stuff. I don't know if he's since disavowed that. I don't know if he changed his opinion on it. I don't know what it is, but at a certain point in time you're like, Jesus, man, are you, are you sure? Like, you got to be really sure before you say something crazy like that. Right, don't you? I mean, don't you think? Look, I think he's a great guy and as a person I'm not attacking it.

Speaker 2:          00:19:48       I just, uh, when he goes crazy and gets mad at me, I love, I want to hug them. I love Lee told me this story about trucks pulling up in front of your house and they could see through your walls. They probably can do that. They do that in different neighborhoods. You know, I like to do something like that, but then have to five of those and this was my experience. He'll tell you something that you got to sit there and go, what the fuck am I doing sitting here? But that's cool. That's Alex and we accept them for what the fuck is. I just thought it was a civil war starting today. I really don't. He was saying the Democrats are going at it today. So somebody shooting somebody. So who the fuck knows to just to calm alex down. Nobody's telling me what to say.

Speaker 2:          00:20:32       No one's telling me what to do. I'm not involved in new world order. Who's the new world? Just enlightened me about the new. I'm not sure. I'm not involved though. I just want Alex to know. Not involved. Who were those people you met the other day where you get a new world daughter? Who's the people, the people you see you eat. Which Smart, oh, these are all podcasters and former professors and all these different people that are doing different things together. Just scared me the other day though. Yeah, on the ropes, right? He was taking. He went back with the CIA.

Speaker 2:          00:21:05       What are you talking about? I ain't gonna say nothing either cheaper too. It's fourth of July. Fireworks like fucking CBS Radford, I think. I think conspiracies are fun and that's part of the problem with conspiracies. They're fun. They're fun to chase down. They really are. They're interests. I'll tell you what's fun to chase down, to read about one and to absorb it by yourself. Once I get into a room with three men and we're on a conspiracy for 48 minutes, that's when I get aggravated. Well, that's what I don't ever want to talk about. That's what the shit that kills me. I don't have the time to discuss with little moon landing or that we all have an idea of what we think happened. Guess what? I really don't want to talk about not on the fucking fourth of July. No. The problem with them is, and this is a tendency, is that when people get really into conspiracy theories, they're into everything being a conspiracy. It's not like they're into conspiracy theories and also into the history of Cuba and then give you a detailed history of some really crazy shit that went down like how many people that are really into conspiracy theories could give you a rundown on how Castro took over Cuba, which is like a real thing that happened in our parents' lifetimes.

Speaker 2:          00:22:29       Right? Think about that. How many people that are really into like, you know, whether or not there's bases on the moon. No, about, you know, all these different things that have happened through human history. The Mongols, the Roman Empire, the Greek camp. Either this crazy shit that definitely really happened. All the stuff that happened during the Vietnam War, all the stuff that happened during the Nixon administration. All that stuff's real. It's fascinating, fascinating shit to look into, but then you get the dumb ones like, Oh God, we really discussed and whether or not the earth is flat. Is this a real conversation like people really doing that satellites aren't real goal on social media. You'll find a bunch of people to agree with you. Two. Got To be so careful about not listening to scientists looked at it with going Saturday, Sunday night, Sunday night on there, 50 years or 60 minutes. It was showing how they interviewed different people. Now the one guy went to some crusade assignment, Saddam Hussein's and he said to him, ask him to tell him that this

Speaker 3:          00:23:46       guy said he's crazy and the interpreter looked at him and says, you, you think Jerry? I ain't asked her that and there was both. There was one particular interview and he was just talking about the interview. He was one of the best interviews he ever did was when he pushed the guy, the guy that was standing behind Kennedy in the car, the the, the agent that should have taken the bullet for Kennedy. They interviewed that guy. That's a great. You got on that one now, but he was one step behind. I mean, he breaks down into tears. He's a real American, like this is a guy that's a real American. Took that job and then like it wasn't your fault and he's like, you don't understand. I was a second behind. If I would have been there just one second earlier, I would've caught it in my back and the president would have been a lot.

Speaker 3:          00:24:38       I mean, it's fucking crazy. Jesus. He imagined being dedicated to protect a guy with your own life and to really drink the serum and to believe it like like a fucking soldier. Those serves very special human beings that can do that. Not a lot of human beings that have that kind of resolve or throw their life in front of a bullet to protect someone else's. That's intense. It is intense pain. You have to hear where the bullet is coming from, what your response time as the B to b. This is when you were real high level body guard. This is. You are the highest of the highest. You're hearing is impeccable. This means when you're walking down the street with this guy inside, you have to learn by yourself how the shadow of nature and noises and listened to footsteps, weapons, clicking, holsters, opening. Think of how interesting.

Speaker 3:          00:25:49       Just that alone is. That's why sometimes when you see him, they're holding one ear because there's zero with anything particular a car's tires screeching differently. Think of that fucking job because that's what their job is to react to that. So if there's. If Joe Rogan has eight guys when they train, and I don't even know. I've never trained in Quantico, but I just know that I think the first two guys, the first four guys will lead guys, they have a mission. One guy gets to the door. If there's a shooting, the other guy ducked. Two guys buck for the president. There's got to be planned. It's like formations and football tunes. What if the line back, it goes this way, you want around me, just take a fucking genius to tell you there has to be formation to protect the president or whoever it is you're protecting and that level.

Speaker 3:          00:26:45       When I'm protecting Kevin Hart, how many people are going to try to assassinate Kevin Hart when I'm protecting our president? How many people are going to really try to shoot that precedent with weapons? I mean, let's go to the Ronald Reagan attempt. Let's go to these attempts. How fucking fast this is. You have to be so high. He leapt Vietnam, another war, and then you had to do a tour with something else where you would just like the sport. You tiptoed in chilled people with toothpicks and shit. This is my dream. This is what I think the training you. I will think you're just born to be Rambo. I think they have to take you to the government and they start with a hundred Rambo's. They just keep training, training, training. You'll lose some along the way and after every hundred you get eight fucking savages that never had chance to get married. The government never gave him a chance to get married.

Speaker 4:          00:27:51       They're that good. Well, all these guys that I know that have been navy seals, all of them are any special forces guys. Just you. Those are different humans, you know, to Digitas, different people, but what's Jocko navy seal. Okay. So in that. Yeah. And um, just just a level that you have to be, you have to have more control over your mind, more control over your will, more control over your discipline. You're, you're in the most elite branch of the military. I mean, this is the elite of the elite money. Make it insanely difficult to get in. So you just get the cream of the crops. The people who are they just a mental fortitude is just unlike an average person. If you meet a bunch of people like that, man, you realized like, wow, people come in all kinds of different levels. There's people that just only surround themselves with other excellence

Speaker 4:          00:28:56       and those dudes like those Jocko type dudes or Tim Kennedy type dudes, those different kinds of human like you, they don't make a lot of those. You just want to have only those boy, you gotta. There's a lot that has to happen before you can become a person like that. You have to, you have to travel through many valleys of the mind. And the body to get to be a person like that, a person have a insane resolve in a time of war. It's a very, very intense human being. It's not even a time a war. Look at these 12 Filipino kids in the fucking back caves down there. Local went to get them to fucking seals. The. The seal team

Speaker 1:          00:29:42       went down that that would happen. Well, there's different various agencies, but there's also a seal team there. Makes Sense. You know the seal team that that's his elite elite. So why do you. I don't even know. That's how you probably become a fucking a bodyguard to the president. You'd have to fucking start like as an attache somewhere for a year or two with a suit on. Just to adjust to human life and life without fucking Aaron bombs. Go off every 20 minutes and shit and then move up in that system until you get to that level, the secret service. There's no way you're going to be a sick. They put you to the secret service training school and you're there in 60 days. Let me tell you something. I got my daughter goes to science camp, you know, whatever the fuck until pre k starts. I'm one of the kids.

Speaker 1:          00:30:36       She goes to his dad's an FBI agent, so you know, my job is everyday to sneak up on them everyday. Snake upon put a gun to his side, like what's going on? Pat Them in the back and he giggles and shit. I taught my wife everyday. He's the worst FBI agent I've ever seen in my life because I'm too lazy. Tiptoeing up to him. He don't even hear me in bushes and that's how good I am. Do you know why though? Because they admire them. Random and academy today. Joe Rogan rather the college. That's why we have so many shootings. That's why we have so many accidents out there were police officers. They don't hire enabled kids anymore. They hire college graduates that have never had what we had seen when you were growing up, if all else failed, you've never been arrested in your life. You really could have been a cop.

Speaker 1:          00:31:26       You're a nice guy, but you really could have been killed. A cop. You could have been joe the cop in Quincy, mass that drives around and shit like that. Sure. Anybody could be. Anybody could be a class, but joe, the cop would have been different if Joe, the cop would've came in here and see me and Jamie argue joe the cop wouldn't arrest me and Jamie, Joe, the cop would say, I want to meet you motherfuckers tomorrow. Retreat will give us both boxing gloves and we would box so that when we were 12 and both go home and get ice cream the next day joe, the cop wouldn't throw. It was both in jail. Joe, the cop wouldn't throw us against a wall and if we turned around and shoot one of us in the fucking leg, he was part of the community. Joe The cop and Joe on the cop knew what it was like living in that community as a child. Do you understand me? So, and I didn't know this. I've been thinking about a lot of baptists and I ran into somebody and I asked them, why are we having the situation we're having in this country? The one last week and fucking East Pittsburgh is just mind blowing. That motherfucker just now. There's a lot of different angles for that. They had just finished doing a shoot out, but the kid took off this cop watch them

Speaker 2:          00:32:40       said, okay God down, drop down military style. Blast him three times. Oh shoot me in the leg, bitch. Shoot me in the leg for running away. That's what joe the cop would do. Yeah, but even shooting someone in the leg away, what you get, it's got to be something that they did. That's really fucked up. Well listen, I believe that she showed me some of them. Take your fucking life. I hear Ya. I'd rather shoot you in the leg then take your life if it's an iffy call, but just so you know, it's not safe to shoot someone in the leg. People die from getting shot in the left ankle. No. Okay, but I'm just mentioning the risk. I don't want to give anybody the impression they can just go around shooting people. How many movies did we grow up, but then the guy got shot in the shoulder.

Speaker 2:          00:33:23       We just went, you live getting show miss shaver. It is. They get pistol whipped and then when they wake up it's like nothing happened. They just start duking it out. They got pistol whipped. Everybody was pistol whipping. People remember that. They would club them in the head with the pistol. That was so crazy. That was like a thing and then these people will wake up. Why? What happened? I didn't get pistol whipped with the but I got pistol whipped with the gun to the head. Nothing blood, thank God, but if fucking hurt, I don't know what the fuck type of gun. It was like an automatic, like a, like a nine millimeter tighten. It wasn't like a revolver. I never got hit with the bud or what a weird feature of the human body. If you hit it in the right spots, it goes out. We have like a plug. We have like a loser, like some people's plugs. A little looser than others. Some people's plugs like Mark Hunt. It takes forever to knock it loose. Some people could just take it, some people can't. It's fucking weird. So weird characteristic hit people. And they go unconscious. It's very strange. It's very strange feature that we exploit, you know,

Speaker 2:          00:34:42       but movies, they always make it like it's no big deal. It's a big fucking deal. It's a big deal. You should avoid having it done to you. It's a big deal to get knocked unconscious.

Speaker 2:          00:34:56       You know, it's so weird. When we first started hanging out one afternoon, you took me to see that boxing coach at the time he had four academy award. God as he was training. Was that Terry Clay Bond try reclaimed Monteith. Terry's amazing. He's a great guy. We walked in there, we went upstairs and I, I think uh, at the time when we walked the Nicholas cage is up there at the time, was a piece on his shit at the bar and stuff. And then Terry came over and gave you a hug and we went downstairs and tyree grab Steve Simone later on because Steve worked there at the time. This is 97, 98 as a gym.

Speaker 1:          00:35:38       And he goes, boy, that guy's in the wrong profession. As a comic, he should've been a boxy. It's like a meal, you know. And I never forgot that him saying that and all the stuff you talk about brain damage and and whatever, it took a lot for you that at that age to realize that this was fucking for real. This was,

Speaker 2:          00:35:58       this was dangerous. There was no money in it. There was no temptation. This head, this head shit is not. This is real. It was real. But it was also a. I didn't have any temptation. Now what happened before this? Like what happened to the guys that I saw playing football and black and white with leather helmets. Well, you know, leather helmets are safer, believe it or not because you don't feel as confident. When they had those leather helmets, it didn't crash into each other the same way. There's a, there's a opinion. I don't know if I agree with it because I don't know much about the sport, but there's an opinion that no pads, no helmets, football would be safer because you wouldn't be able to do the same things that they're doing now. You can't just run into people head to head. You just just destroy you and you can only do it a few times.

Speaker 2:          00:36:44       Your body will start breaking, but if you're putting helmets on and pads, it accentuates your ability to run into someone with all your force that's unnatural and it creates an unnatural jarring of the body and the brain that the rugby guys don't get. The rugby guys don't have all those paths, so when they're clashing into each other, they're learning how to roll with things and not just colliding into each other. They're not. There's a different game when you've got padding, so if you take away the padding, people have to be more careful and how they're engaged. They can't just charge in and smash into each other. They won't last. I always cte the game context sport for sure. Getting banged up. It's a contact sport context. Are there any. Don't know. Interesting fun though. I remember being a kid. I'm from New Jersey. It's a real good question. And fucking Jersey, right? Yeah, we know football. I didn't even go to soccer back then when I lived in Jersey through soccer's a couple of Spanish people, played the dark side of the court. It played soccer on Sundays. They will even let. Nobody wants me, a couple of Spanish guys. But besides that, soccer was not

Speaker 1:          00:37:54       begging my area. But uh, when I moved to Aspen I would go to the hospital on Saturday just to walk around and get a big of the sandwich and I'd see rugby. I had never saw that. I didn't even know what the fuck it was and I was like, I'm in good shape. And after about three times I went, one of the guys at I want you to show up on a fucking Saturday. And I looked at them like, what are you crazy? Like, I don't even know what the fuck you guys are doing. They have a big rug rug fest in Aspen every year, pretty much every year. That's where I first saw rugby was in Colorado.

Speaker 2:          00:38:30       I don't think you've ever seen it live. I've only seen it on TV. No, I've seen it live, but it's, you know, I saw three, I saw two things that blew me away live and in Colorado I saw rugby and I saw when they did like a tour de France star type race, but they did it sludge snowmass village and I knew exactly what it was the road up and how we would have to be a circle to go by and you didn't have to go back down to rule to would just do circles around snowmass and I still remember being on a hill, listening to them going up the hill and it just blew my fucking mind the way the tire was hitting the speeds, like how fast they were going uphill and then 20 years later you realize that doing ppo and fucked and hanging out with Sheryl Crow's though husband shooting all that shit.

Speaker 2:          00:39:26       Can you imagine when they were shooting in the eighties when I saw him, Jesus was shit stronger back then. I can only imagine what's the drug that they shoot at. The legs won't stop moving at night. So they got a gun on a bicycle. Oh, epo. It's not the delay, the blood gets thick apparently, I'm probably saying it wrong, but uh, they have this feeling like they have to exercise. One of our buddies was a biker and you know, he was professional tour guide, just like, you know, not like a super famous super successful one, but he was a professional bike rider. What would you call one of those cyclists? Professional cyclists. And he would tell us about it, how guys you'd hear them. He knew that they were on epo and then you would hear them when they were on a tour bus. They'd get up in the middle of the night and go ride their bike.

Speaker 2:          00:40:16       Like they felt like they had to exercise. So I guess if you're on a lot of it, I don't know, I've never done it. It seems like it would be awesome though, if you could take some drug that like super juiced up your endurance. That sounds awesome. But apparently it's just not very safe. And there were saying that um, a lot of executives take it now. Like there's, there's people that are executives that are just entering endurance races and they're taking epo and entering into these endurance races that like regular people with regular jobs just decided to take it. There was some article about that, see if he could find it. It was like Ceos, uh, entering into an endurance races taking epo, but it's a few fighters. I'm been caught with it and it apparently just really juices up your urine. You go 16 rounds instead of fucking type shit. Yeah. I had a friend that used to shoot me steroids and never do a pushup. Jesus Christ, he was whacked. That's crazy dog. When are you going to go to the gym? Next week? That's same. I'll never forget seeing him eat like half a bottle

Speaker 3:          00:41:34       of Winnie v, the pink football. Like the pink ones in the eighties. He would just put them into this. I'm like, pick the X. would it be a Oh my God, tomorrow did some pushups today. Just my biceps. That's all I need. A few biceps. A talions crazy group of humans that came out of always wanting you to do the impersonation from you. When the Italian people in Jersey. From that, that Marlon Brando is gay.

Speaker 3:          00:42:10       I can't fucking believe in 20 years he was the godfather and no, no, no. He couldn't blow a regular dude. No. God forbid he blows a black dude really stabbed me right here and the fuck they lot. I couldn't even take it no more. I had to throw the DVD collection away and fucking. I would love to hear one of those guys. What they said. They found that, that that week, didn't they say that he fucked everybody? Men and women. He banged. Everybody fucked everybody. Yeah, and then it came out. He was banging the guy with the big Dick and cube. That's right. Superman. That's so fucking poor Italian people. If that godfather fans, they will lighten those fucking dvds on five. Fuck. Marlon Brando. Poor. Poor homophobes. I like them more now. I like Marlon Brando Brando. Yeah. I don't give a fuck. I don't listen to me. Richard. Prior to thinking about Richard Pryor getting so coked up that he lit Marlon Brando fucker was one of the things I was like, unless he that's prejudice with me, I should just assume he enjoyed it and I assume he enjoyed having sex with a brand. Why should I give a shit? Listen to the first number one thing,

Speaker 3:          00:43:22       because you're going to die when I tell you this. Oh, Marlin Brando. Talk to studio and to give them like 100 grand to read superman. Like you know when people call you up Joe. Hi Joe. This is Cynthia from your agents, right? We're sending you a script over to approved to read.

Speaker 3:          00:43:41       Yeah, hundred grand. Give me a hundred grand and I'll reduce it because he went to the island. He went deep and he believed his ego. You got to remember that was an all time record for a long time. When he got Super Mad, he banged him out. He took them to the cleanest time. Shoot him. He fucked them up in the ass. Bad. My big find that what they pay them in 1970 whatever for Superman member, he fucked them big time. Um, I think it's mutiny on the bounty and one of those movies they kept saying, Oh, we have a beautiful spot for you right here in little marina though, right? If we do this, we'll do this on this island. My phone, he had gone down there from La. He's like, there's a bunch of running around. There's a bunch of women running around with leaves on it. No damage. I didn't do that.

Speaker 3:          00:44:29       He made the studio shoot down there then and then went down there. Who wants to go to the fucking? Whatever island they shot that. So that's where he lived. Right. So he went down there, he got down and he's like, Jamie, which your job pa no more either director Rogan, you're this. And everybody was shooting. They were shooting his feet. They were shooting him rotten and like the shore and meanwhile he was just banging fucking Hawaiian when either the time this happened. Oh, gas bagging kids. All those kids that shop themselves, all those kids he had no more. Oh my God, those poor kids that fucking God rest his soul that all those problems he had, he was down there like fucking just matador and whatever paramont whether the network was showed up, down and so let's see the dailies and said, what the fuck is this?

Speaker 3:          00:45:17       You're done. They brought somebody else in. Malden ended up saying, fuck it, I'll buy the island he bought the island. Didn't need like, this is just crazy shit. I heard over the years and they just lived on the island and then if they wanted to have a quality island and they have like levels or you want me to read the script? That's what, of course she had. Oh you want me to come to the studio? That's $300,000. But he had levels of fucking and they would give it to them. They will. And then they didn't want him for the Godfather. They were like, Nah, there's no way we want that fucking guy. Wow. And then finally he put the tape in his mouth and all that shit. And they approved them and he didn't know that movies like a point to one. He did that last tango in Paris isn't, that's like a light porn and then the chick came out.

Speaker 3:          00:46:05       He just laid there and said that motherfucker stone cold rape me. He. Yeah, he was the king of me too. He invented me too. That motherfucker dog. Wow. Yeah. She came out years later and said something about she didn't know what Marlon Brando went in there and choked her out like mcqueen and fucking and the getaway. She thought she was just getting pushed. You had the mcqueen and who was with him? That was hard to watch, Dude, because you could tell that was real. There's no way that wasn't real. Like he was really hitting her and let her know he was a method actor is harsh. He's crazy. He was crazy. Scene was so real because of it. I mean it's awful to watch but. But it's real, right? It's an awful scene. It's real fuck man. That you imagine being her and all of a sudden that do just start smacking you in the head for real. You don't know what to do and you don't want to bail out of the scene. You're getting fucked up though. He fucking you up and she didn't stop. She just kept saying the lines and working with it. Fuck Dude. Jesus Christ. What do you say to somebody after that game? And I'm sorry, but that's what the scene call for

Speaker 4:          00:47:30       you can't see out of peep for it sounds fucked up to say, but I think even just that recent time, people did not understand that if you're smacking people in the head like that, you're giving them fucking brain damage. Like you smack someone in the head like that. Like you could seriously fucked them up. Like something could be wrong with them for a long time. Even if they don't go unconscious.

Speaker 1:          00:47:58       Your mother is Maggie? No, no. My mom wasn't a or really? No, she wasn't a head. Which Matthew, that very few people.

Speaker 4:          00:48:11       Uncle. No, very few people. I'll tell you, it won't be my grandmother cracked me once, but it was, you know, just like get your shit together. Not like trying to hurt me, you know, just a little smack. I didn't get beat as a kid. But uh, I saw a lot of violence. I saw the scene violence when you were a kid. There's something about like seeing someone you're close to who is an adult be beating up like a 10 or 11 year old. You ever see that before? When you see, when you see somebody that you ever see a grown adult beaten the shit out of a 10 or 11 year old when you're a little kid? Yes. That to me was. That was like a defining moment when I was a little kid as a parent or I only show a parents beat the children. Yeah. I saw someone beat somebody else's kid. It was fucked up to watch man

Speaker 1:          00:49:12       when I lived on 200, five west, 88th street. We can't. When I came from Cuba, we live in New Jersey for him. My Dad died at 89th street. Then something happened at the building. We ended up moving to 88th street and they had a kid I had a beef with every day and one day I finally got my shit together and karate

Speaker 1:          00:49:33       like one day on my side kickstart at working and that fucking right cross started working to learn how to use my fucking block and I finally had this kid. His name was rudy, the Haitian. He was the only Haitian kid in the neighborhood. We lived on 88th street and I fucked them up this day and his father came down and held my arms and he made rudy punched me and I'll never forget that my lip was bleeding and he took me upstairs and knocked on my mother's door and my mother opened up the door and half a fucking angle and she goes, what's the problem? She goes out with Coco, you know, and he goes, next time you sun hits my son, I'm going to hit him. And I'm like, come on you. My mom turned around and got a butcher knife and chased rudy's. Fall up the stairs, chops claim and the lady next door.

Speaker 1:          00:50:20       So she didn't see a knife, but at that point we were done in the building. Geez. That was one of the worse there. When I moved to North Bergen, I saw parents that you don't like. You ever hear a comedian go hang out with white kids? He wasn't a house. How they talked to their parents. I could never talk to about. You know, that's the first thing I noticed when I went to jersey, there was, there were certain kids that will take the addition go, I don't want to fish sandwich. If I ever did that in my house. Joe Rogan are you fucking kidding me? My mom would take the dish, throw it against the wall and say, now you're not fucking eat and go to bed. Like that type of shit. But I also saw a fucking parent in the hallway one day I was standing in the way.

Speaker 1:          00:51:12       You are with his arms crossed. Torque them to the teacher the way I'm talking to you. And a kid standing right here with glasses on. And I'm walking towards him like, you know, I went to the bathroom and like a hall pass and I'm talking, talking, talking, and in the middle of it, the father just going back and hitting them with a backhand kick goes down, glasses, broken. Blood's coming out of the nose. Oh please tell them to get the fuck up before I fucking kill you. You dumb mother fucker. Oh, you said that to him. You dumb. Fuck. I have seen that. Oh, that kid was the devil. I know that kid. Well, the reason why they can't get Kim's the devil probably because his dad beat him. And then there was another kid when I went to Catholic school, we know Father Ginzo the whole fucking thing, bro. He would come that the nicest guy in the world. But the sun was fucking crazy. And every time he get there, the nun would tell him about what he did and dog. He would punch him the way.

Speaker 1:          00:52:22       Old Guy always throwing punches. Guy fucking Steve Bay. I switched rooms. Was griff right as he was crawling into the car like a frown. Pounded them 12. Jesus, I got thrown out of that 11. So now are you looking at me saying Joey did they deserve it or whatever. Everybody, every parent had a different, uh, you know, I watched a couple of weeks ago I was stung to the gills and I was laughing about how people put people down and shit. And I was laughing about when Julia serving first when the Aba shut down, when the Aba for a shut down, if they were, I don't know Joe, but if there was eight categories, Julius Irving's lead seminars and the Aba shut down and the six is picked up. Julia serving. They gave him $6,000,000, which can you imagine that? What would they give that guy yet? What they give Le Bron? Ron's getting about 30 or 40, but yet he got $6,000,000 over two years or that was Julius and

Speaker 3:          00:53:26       he was the biggest play in the world that now this guy's getting 1:54 for three cheeses. So Dr Jay switches number from 32 to six and now the NBA All star game came. So all the critics were like, he came from the Aba, he's gonna, get his ass kicked in the NBA All star game. What? Go look at those statistics. He went off, he went off because I'm a white dude named Pistol Pete Maravich. That is. He went to Lsu and lead the country in scoring a white dude and ended up becoming a fucking booze about that dude knew how to handle the ball because his father would beat him. His father would make him sleep in the garage and the winter and beat him until he learned how to play basketball because there was no losing in this fucking house. Do you understand me, Joe Rogan? No. Fucking my fucking house.

Speaker 3:          00:54:20       Sleep in the garage. No data pistol. Pete knew how to dribble jacket with a pistol. Pete would take you deep pistol. Pete can. Anybody could cover by the best black dude in the league and cover pistol pete. But if you watch the NBA All star Game Pistol Pete stomping chomping people and give them behind the back passes to Julius Irving. He even looks at a do a one path. He's looking at Bob Mcadoo. I'm coming, I don't think just puts the ball between his legs and he gives it to Julia serving. Why? Because that kid's father stayed on.

Speaker 3:          00:54:56       There's different thoughts of some people can handle that. Some people have to like some. Some guys are broken, but I mean it's like how much pressure is too much pressure to create like a superstar like that. I didn't. Tiger Woods didn't. His Dad put a lot of pressure on him as well. It was. Now let's talk about the. The guy that died last week, but that's a different thing I can tell. Well, the tiger woods, Joe Jackson. What the fuck is different about that? He created three fucking kids that changed the fucking one kid that change the fucking world. He beat on me. Fuck them in the ass. Opposed to. I don't know. He did sexual assault. One. Got To be really careful with the same things. I'm sorry. Listen this to me. Two things. Things come out. What are you going to do? Everybody's getting the blame for something. You know what I'm saying? But this is something you really heard. I have heard sexual abuse allegations from his father, but, but I listen to what, listen to what did he create, what do they do? What did Joe Jackson do by making them not letting them fucking and, and let me tell you something to one kid could have gone to a college to play basketball. The kids had talent as it was gary, Indiana ever go to carry and then. No, it's like hell

Speaker 3:          00:56:06       a fucking Delaware. And then Gary, Indiana, like, you know what I'm saying? Like Gary's like crazy. He made these kids for her. She pulled them out of Gary, took him up to fucking Berry Gordy,

Speaker 1:          00:56:22       you know, you think about this shit. Some of them probably hated him for what he did. You look back at those lessons that you got Joe Rogan. How many people did you look at one day and go, fuck you motherfucker. But then two years later you look back and you look at the lesson you learned from the whole experience and you actually have to go back and hug that person and go, hey man, thank you for that time. It made me better motherfucker tonight. Because what you did made me a better person will have to agree with everything that happens along the way. Joe wrote, but it's maintenance. Who the fuck we are today?

Speaker 4:          00:57:00       That's an interesting thing because we grew up in a time where kids were just allowed to run around outside. Everybody ran around outside. That was just normal. Right. When you were a little kid, you ran around outside. Nobody just runs around outside. I remember the first time I saw a grown lady hit. She hit my cousin. We were both around the same age. I was probably six and she was five and this lady slipped on ice in front of her apartment building and she got up and my cousin just unfortunately happened to be standing right in front of her when she fell and she got up and she said, don't you laugh at me? And she smacked her in the face. She wasn't laughing at her either. Just she smashed her in the face, man like it was. She smacked her hard and I was like, oh my God. Was that we were both little, little kids and watching some grown adults smash our cousin in the face real like

Speaker 3:          00:58:01       like, hey, you can't you, you know, you gotta be polite. There's some fucking people that was smack you in the face and she didn't even do anything wrong. Here's some evil fuckers out there that'll hit little kids. That's a dark shit man. Smack and little kids in the face. I swear to God. I read into probably when I first moved from Cuba, but to Ada street, there was a dude on the block that would smack the little kids and I'm telling you right now to my little daughter that was words on the street that he would take it through his house and fuck you the ass. Oh my goodness. That is that early 70 [inaudible].

Speaker 3:          00:58:46       This was the early seventies, which I turned into a joke later on because it would be like, Bro, have you seen Joe Rogan lately? I haven't seen them in a week. Sticky Charlie go like, what was his name? Mr Martinez. Mr Martinez the Martini Guy. Like when you first moved to 88th street. That's the first and the kid to tell you like, I will you this guy. Don't fuck them, Mr. Martini. Oh Jesus. He's a monster and it's nearby. Kenny wore a black suit with a white shirt and black shoes. His wife would die and he owned the building at Eighth Street in the middle and he was angry and he would sweep and you know, like when you were a kid and you stop in front of somebody's house, he would always come out and go get the fuck outta here. You little fucking Douche bags. Get the. And I was Cuban.

Speaker 3:          00:59:35       I didn't understand the language. I didn't really understand what he was saying. I understood the anger, but other than understanding the language and they will come out with a broom, get the fuck out of here. One day I realized I'm like, this motherfucker wants to rock. So while my other friends didn't want to fuck with him, I'm like, we're going to fuck with this motherfucker. So all humans have at like one in front of their house and there's something that your mother's role is changing every day. Good luck. Statue. And I would steal the change and bring it downstairs and I will look at the poor kids and I go, come in, if there's anything you want to call it. And they would go, yeah, we'll get a quarter. I would take a quarter and throw it with Mr. Martini lived. He lived like in a basement area.

Speaker 3:          01:00:13       He ran the whole bit. He'd be right there and he chased us. We'd go Mr Matine something like weaning and fucking chases chases caught yet he would fucking hit you like 50 times. But we fucked him up. We would fuck him up dog. I saw some shit the first day like New Jersey to me. Was it completely? That was like Mars to most people, like most people listening to me and go, you grew up someplace that doesn't exist. I'll bring eight people, throw these chairs to tell you about the parents and the people and the situations. But the first day I went out in my hometown, I'm up Bergen. I saw me and Joe Rogan fight. And even though I had Joe Rogan on his back, I saw Joe Rogan's father come down the stairs. Pulled me off. Joe Rogan smack me, punched me. He kicked me, throw me on the floor and make this kid go in.

Speaker 3:          01:01:12       That was my first experience ever. North Bergen, New Jersey. I saw Mr Robson come downstairs. He took anthony off. His son drew him off. She smacked him in the fucking face. Joe Rogan had two half after fucking noon in 90 degree. He punched him in the stomach and told them to go home. You Little Guinea, fuck, go home. You Little Guinea. Fuck. Say that now they'll throw you in jail for two years. He told them, go home, you go to Guinea. Fuck. And Anthony looked at him crying a little bit. He picked up his shirt. He went like this, like he took the thing off. I think it was unclear on my fucking father. You're fucking dead. Motherfucker. Call Your fucking Guinea fucking greaseball father. God I, he's probably a grease ball just like you. And I'm sitting there going, I want to see how this plays out. And next thing you know, two cop cars pull up and it's one cop car that's unmarked.

Speaker 3:          01:02:06       It's another one that's marked and it's a big fucking Italian looking detective like you know the, the short stumpy paddling and he comes out of his car. He puts his fucking jacket on. It barely fits, but till this day I remember the more the dowels he had on his hand and he goes, what the fuck's going on here? Kids? And the little Italian kid completely goes missing the fucking Mr. Robinson came down and he fucking smack me in the face. These are my witnesses. Then he fucking hit me and I'm sitting there going, oh, this is going to get fucking good. Then next thing you know the, the fucking cop, the detective tells the cop, go look around and see if there's tickets. Go spread tickets. And he goes, where's the sky live? And he goes, yeah. And he goes, and he grabbed all the other kids and he goes, tell me what happened.

Speaker 3:          01:02:53       And he goes, anthony and him were fighting and he came down here and he fucking pulled him and that this time they know that the cops are there. And Mr Robson, I kind of opened this door to be kind of tough, like he's not coming up where he's on the normal fucking knock came up to and the cop goes, okay, okay, okay. And he grabbed the kid and he goes, you're okay, right? Yeah. And he goes, he just hit me in the face and he fucking walked up the stairs. Brown took come five minutes, got to the top thing. I opened the fucking door. Joe Rogan. This guy will put his hand. Then he pulled the fucking put them against the fucking thing on the second floor with everybody out and just started punching him, punching him, punching him like fucking John June. It's one of these, got you're down.

Speaker 3:          01:03:43       He's hitting you with those shots to the head until the guy killed over and they started kicking him with the fucking thing. Bam, Bam, Bam. And he goes, don't you ever fucking hit my son again? Let's get outta here. Or that was how I became friends with the family because as soon as he came down, he goes, who's this kid? He goes, he's good. He's the only one that jumped in. He goes, you want to come home for dinner? And that was the beginning of my life when I got in that police car. Wow. Because I did whatever I did. Whatever the fuck I want to look at this until today. This is fucking crazy. And you know me and you don't fuck around with. He got over there. This is still, that's what happened in 1970 fucking three and once that today that's. I'll go the car. What is this car to do it. It does what? It will need it to do. It does whatever I needed to do. You know what I'm saying? You're a family member. Why? Because of that fucking day because I'm the only guy that jumped in.

Speaker 3:          01:04:43       I like how cops have things like that. A family member have a card you can get from one of your buddies who's a cop show. Do you ever get pulled over and put this on your license plates? A little sneaky little thing. So now what type of meeting the house. I'm eating fucking pasta with fresh Mozzarella in the middle. Oh, I could open up the front door, whatever I wanted. I called the mom, mom. She makes cream pops. Oh Wow. I'm tight with them. I'm the only Cuban in 1974. Let's even walking in there. So now we're in the sixth grade and we're playing kickball. Can Lee had no, fucking remember two months ago I wanted to generously donated 50,000 to a grammar school. Was my grandma's school North Bergen? New Jersey a couple months ago? Yeah. I wanted to. Genesis donated $50,000 when I went to that grammar school was motherfuckers didn't have a gym. Joe Rogan. You shovel snow. They're going to be

Speaker 3:          01:05:38       shoveled. Snow shoveled snow. When it snowed out, you shovel snow. That was part of your physical education and you did pushups and sit ups and fucking Russian Shit Bro. And they had a bar in the kitchen. We didn't know they were brutal. Finally they built a gym in the eighth grade. Yeah, but before that we played kickball outside in the fall. One day will king playing kickball, and I forget this guy's name was Mr Laura. That was the teacher's name. Was he a good guy? It was a little gym, PJ and we're out there and we're playing kickball and again, that little Italian kid, the one that invited me, there was four other dude. We're playing kickball and he's throwing the ball and every time I swing and I miss, he's calling me Gacaca. That means I'm a boogie face in Spanish because it rhymes a coco. Right. And the teacher keeps going. But a, I told you a thousand times, none of that SPEC sheets allowed.

Speaker 3:          01:06:38       This is the sixth grade North Bergen, New Jersey school teacher. Mr [inaudible] was like, Hey, none of that shit over here. Right? This is America. Right? Really? That was at that time. That was a big issue because a couple weeks before that, a guy named Portora was a baseball coach and he threw a kid off for speaking Spanish on the bus. He told me there's no Spanish on the bus, and the kid goes, fuck you. Or they spoke Spanish. They threw them off like 20 miles from the house. Became a big problem in my hometown. They're going to kill the fucking dude, but I remember going home, my mom going, he's talking to the truth

Speaker 3:          01:07:21       and now she speaks Spanish. This is America outside. You speak American. So my mom cut me off right there. Like I went home, like ready to fucking be like a protestor. She was like, that don't happen here. We're Americans. He wants to expand. It's totally like the house. I think there's a real benefit to being able to speak more than one language. Definitely is complete different mindset. I'm happy I do it. I speak to my daughter in Spanish. If I tell him I asked him mercy, something. I reasked her in Spanish. If I read, I read tyler and spread. Nice. Yeah. They say that things like that they're learning new languages in particular opens up parts of your brain that if you're just a dummy like me that only speaks English. You can access different. Just different ways of looking at things, you know? Well, it's very analytical. Say you wanted

Speaker 2:          01:08:15       to be a lawyer, one of your pre. Whatever would be a language, right? You'd also have a heavy math to be a lawyer, you have to have a very heavy math prereq. Iom. Yeah, a lot of history. You probably ended up being a history major, but there'd be a lot of math while the economy, a lot on the analytics because it forces your mind to solve equations, so when, if you look at the prerequisites, if you whatever the fuck it is, what is the glue? Requisites. Prerequisites to be an attorney. It was a lot of math involved. Interesting. There's got to be the language involved. There's got to be politics involved, American political systems, American history systems, all that shit, but it's got to be heavy math once you get the law. School was heavy reading and. But before that, it's a lot of problem solving.

Speaker 2:          01:09:09       Yeah, that's the. That's how you become a problem solver by fucking whatever. Yeah, I agree with you. Whatever you just said, but before I got locked up, I was planning to be an attorney, so I was really. I'm a history major. Yeah, that's that. That was the fucking plan. And then history, podcasts. I love them. They're the best. I was thinking of going back to school. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. There's no reason. Just listening and refresh and then go on and read about it, but that you listen to the great but a hardcore history and ever listing my boy Daniel de la history on fire. His Shit. It's fantastic. He was telling me about this road to Rome. I've never forgot this image where there was I think something like a hundred and 50 miles of bodies that were put on steaks.

Speaker 2:          01:10:08       He sent it to me. He just sounded to me a couple of days ago, hundred and 50 miles of of human bodies that they stuck on these big poles and shoved him into the ground for like for my, like every 30 yards, they put a new person's body. Here it is. One hundred 25 miles with one body crucified every 30 yards or so for a total of about 6,000 people crucified on the road between Capua and Rome. What the fuck now? What was your purpose? I would have to go back and listen to it again. I forgot. Sansa, Shalom rather here. Whew. That's shit's intense. I want to start with. I'm going to start from zero. I'm going to start with the Mongolians and go listen. Wrath of the con Dan Carlin greatest podcast world ever. And then I want to move on to American history.

Speaker 2:          01:11:06       Oh, he's the one I need to. American history one. Oh, one day one. We're going back to the roots. Let's go from roots. Let's go to 17, 76. What happened all there? I need all that. Refresh. Yeah. All that stuff needs to be refreshed. Do Carla and guy has got some stuff on world war one that's covered both wars was covered. Both wars. Let's cover the third war. Vietnam and let's cover the fucking whatever the conflict. All that shit. I was doing comedy so he watches the news. I don't know who the fuck was watching the news in 1991. Not Me. I didn't watch TV again until 2003 or something like that and watch the fucking news and have a chance to be inclined politically or what the fuck was going on. I was just worried about doing standup. Right.

Speaker 2:          01:12:04       This silence brought to you by marijuana or. I didn't. No, no, no. I didn't know. I thought he was looking for something or whatever. Or I'm ready to fucking go. You know, we've got a great fucking card. Just fucking breakdown. Now. You broke it down with Brendan. I gotta tell you man, I like. I'm leaning and I love Dan male. He's a fucking champions. The champions. He took a fucking couple bombs from Anthony Johnson bomb, Samantha Johnson, but Jesus Christ, every time they put an obstacle in front of steep based way, he figures out a way to take it down. You know, he's hell bent on staying champion. He's a giant dude like steep pays a big guy and I know that Daniel has beaten every single heavyweight. He's fought. He's undefeated as a heavyweight and including like throwing Josh Barnett around who's just a beast, but a steep pays a as the most accomplished heavyweight champion of all time.

Speaker 2:          01:12:56       That's just a fact. He defended his title against the top contenders and did it successfully three times. Nobody else been able to do that. Okay, good. Holloway. Jesus Christ. When we fight both fights or Jesus, man, a DC fight is a fascinating, fascinating fight to it. So funny. Nominal wrestler and steep a is. I mean he's as good as it gets. You're doing the show Friday night? Yeah, we're doing. Me and Ian are doing the Mirage. Okay, beautiful. Yeah. Should be fun. Nice. You ready for it? Yeah man. I'm excited. I'm excited for this card. It should be. It should be very interested in what's going on with you and the running lately. You're really digging it. Yeah, I'm digging it, but I have a little bit of a tear in my meniscus. Are you thinking of if you fix them in this case of doing something with running, like running, but your buddy does those marathons?

Speaker 2:          01:13:50       Oh No. Have you considered something like that or not really, man, I'm not. I don't. I'm not into doing something that I know is hard to do and it's definitely not good for your body. I just think you get beat up doing that shit. Tomlin was just take your friend. I mean as good as Shannon. Different kinds of human. Well, he believes that in some ways they take them to recover from something that. Well, that's an interesting thing. You just a good good time for that question because he just ran a race today. He ran like a six mile race and he was saying that his legs are not fully recovered. Who was saying in the post that, you know, his cardio was really good, but you got to figure you run for 24 hours. I mean he ran for 24 hours just a month ago, right?

Speaker 2:          01:14:32       Was it a month ago? Not even a month ago, three weeks ago. Something like that. Um, that shit takes time and he's 50, you know, when you're 50 years old, it's not as a recovery is that. Recovery is very tough. He's an animal. He lives to push himself like that. I'm more inclined to try to preserve my body. I like pushing myself, but I'm just a chicken shit. I don't want to be, I don't want to be breaking hips and knees and shit. Our brother just had shoulder surgery, Eddie Bravo and he just got the stitches out. This is his second surgery that he's had just this year, you know, he had um, he had knee surgery real recently, like a few months ago, right? Didn't he have his meniscus done a few months ago? This generation of Jujitsu guys is learning a lot and they're learning what they're going to pass on to the next generation is that it's great to roll.

Speaker 2:          01:15:27       The lego blocks are great at all. That is great. But there's another aspect to this. Disposition was called yoga and keeping your muscles strong conditioning has to be good. And your, uh, you know, there's just take care of yourself. These, these guys didn't. No, you didn't. No, no, no. Well, it took a while to learn. But the reality of Jujitsu is it's a thing that as you get older you have to be much more careful who you trained with and how you train. You can't just go balls to the wall like you could when you were 27. You have to keep your shit together and you know, injuries are real. You can't just work through them. Like that was a big fallacy. People would get hurt and they would try to roll light and nobody ever rose light. Then we say they're gonna roll light and then the guy almost gets you in.

Speaker 2:          01:16:14       Then you're trying to get him. Next thing you know you're defending and it's fucking serious. Heated up roll session, which is great. But then you're like, ah, like you're next. All fucked up. And you go, all right, next guy. I'm just going to lay on my back at work. My half guard bullshit. As soon as it starts getting hot and heavy, almost got caught in an arm bar. They didn't try to pop up, but then try to pass his guard. Then you get into it. You know, it's a, it's a thing that's exciting, you know, and she jitsu. Uh, and when I say rolling hard, I don't mean like, not even. No, no, no. Listen to me passing your garden and lay it on you. That's tough. That's a tough morning. Even though I'm giving you love on top joke and you breathe. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:16:57       I'm good Joe. I'm letting you get the book. I will give tons of love it. I love it. Yeah, addicted to it. It's changed who I am, you know, I had an attack from a different foundation. I was attacking it from looking at Jamie and going, I got to do what Jamie does and not realizing I got Jamie by 25 years and I can't do what Jamie does. So my game has to be completely different to Jamie's Mondays when I come into class, it's more about the, uh, the, the uh, drilling less about the rolling and I'll do an hour conditioning class with bread. We do everything. We do the ball things, the ropes. I do everything and I'll do that Jujitsu class, but I'll do the drills are roll once or twice and papa's got to go Thursday. I go balls to the wall on the roaming, which means three or four role.

Speaker 2:          01:17:52       That's awesome. And then I tried to take Friday off and Saturday I'll do and conditioning and I'm done for the week. Joey Diaz getting fit. You got to do it. I got this five year old, number two, I watched your thing and I really do it. I go to fucking crowd therapy and I put my head in that I got a US cryotherapy. I'm a Novus or guy to that bed is making me feel fucking phenomenal. What is it? I'm getting tremendous Harlan's. What is it? The Nova thought bed. The bed that you lay on, it cleans out yourselves and shit like that. Do it. Does everything look it up? You understand me? Plus I get in that freezer for three minutes and 30 seconds. I put Madonna. Burn enough you love. And what? The Gay Pride. I forgot all about the gate center. Fitter. Healthier, happier. What is it?

Speaker 2:          01:18:38       Tremendous job doing it. They're going to talk us into getting into a pod and next thing you know you're going to be locked into the. Into the Matrix. What? So what is this treatment? No negative side effects clients or supply supplied with safety goggles and then relax into Novo Thor treatment prod for eight to 15 minutes of whole body restorative light treatment. The treatment maybe repeated two or more times a week. What is it? Doing something what it's done, but like what does the instigate the fucking the other look into before, but tell me why I should get your light box. It's a whole body delivery system of PBM therapy that has been designed to deliver optimum wave lengths power. What does that word? Densities and dosages based on the published clinical research outcomes. Huh? I can't read. For me it works the whole body, just six slash 15 minutes.

Speaker 2:          01:19:40       The intended use of Nova thor or to redevelop muscles or restore motion to joints or for use as an adjunct therapy for obesity. That seems like it does a lot of shit. I don't know. Is that real? I'm trying to hang on. Is that real? Jamie? Do I look okay? You look good. All right. Then moving gun like you're losing weight. Yeah. No, you have to do something. We all that training. You do and you're doing that much training. That's crazy. That's really awesome. I really love it. That's beautiful. Yeah. They tried to do one strength training at the House on that style with club. If you want to come here, man. Well I'll work you out. We'll work out together. I was thinking about calling you. Maybe you can give me a kickbox and less than this and you know what else we could do?

Speaker 2:          01:20:24       We could do like a circuit, a circuit training because I have that, a eco air bike, that echo bike I've never done. That's phenomenal. So we could do a rose the ACO bike and I got a versa climber and I like to do, um, in a, do those Tabata sequences. So it's like you go hard for 20 seconds and then you rest for 10 seconds and then you go hard for 20 seconds and the restaurant and you do like eight rounds of those. It's fucking intense. And then you jump on over to the row machine. The machines, there's another one similar number. It's like 30, 30, hard, 30 off, something like that. And then you go to the versa climber and you plug in some. Yeah, yeah. I'm 52. I'm almost 51. I'll be 51 in August to August. It's really interesting what I've learned and what I read about 50, I show a picture of Carol. Okay. About a year ago when he was 46 years old, when he was doing, while she finishes what Jesus only said, well, go to that picture. Archie bunker was stopped or when he started out, it was a picture and it was 46 and I was like, there has to be a better way. Let me see that. I saw holy Shit, you know, this is what America is crazy. What did you look like at 46 and 47? And you were like, look at that dude. He looked like, well maybe that was like in the later years.

Speaker 2:          01:21:52       There's a funny thing, right? The lovable racist. He was like the last of like he represented a real guide that might've had racist views that were kind of funny and he was just some way in deering because he was such a good actor and it was such a good character. So well written and his relationship with his wife and his kids and with meathead. I mean the whole thing was, it was a brilliant show. Well, it's such a well crafted show. Sammy Davis kissed him on the lips when fucking Puerto Ricans do wallet. Rican guy comes over there talking. He looks at his wife from Puerto Rico was alice, don't just stand there or something. And she goes, I don't know what he likes. And he goes, I don't know, a Puerto Rican his drink. And he looks at him, the guy smiling. I'm like, he looks something like Puerto Rican drink.

Speaker 2:          01:22:53       He goes, I don't know. How about some pineapple juice? You know what I'm saying? The guy looks at it, you get thrown off the Ed today, but it wasn't that. It wasn't hateful. It was queens. Racism. Well first of all, pineapple juice is delicious. And why is it racist that a dude from an island would want some pineapple juice? I would think that. Would you be culturally sensitive to like introduce that possibility, that something that you do have a tradition of drinking? Because if I said to you, listen, I'm leaving him, I'm going to try and make a fireworks. Somebody heard me say it to you right now. Tomorrow we'd be good fucking. Yeah, we would have a problem. I would have a problem where everybody knows at 20 years ago, right now, I'd be heading to Chinatown in New York City. Get the fuck on the matter of fireworks.

Speaker 2:          01:23:45       One hundred and 44 bottle rockets. A couple of Roman candles. You know what's the most stupid man is that the food is somehow racist. Like there's. There's food that's racist food. Like if you talked about black people and also talked about delicious fried chicken or delicious Orange Soda or grape soda would be grape soda right now. Orange Soda. So it white people. Yeah. Orange Soda is a white people thing, right? White Trash, Orange Soda? No. Is that. Not that I'm anti Orange Soda, but I'm saying like those foods like watermelon and particular, if you talk about a black person and you talk about watermelon, that's a racist term. Even though watermelon is delicious. It's fucking weird. Like what the hell could be wrong about watermelon if you don't like the taste of watermelon. If it's a hot summer day and somebody busts open a cooler and gives you a slice of watermelon, how fucking pumped are you?

Speaker 2:          01:24:43       How could watermelon ever be negative? That don't make any sense. To me, it makes zero sense and the only way it makes sense that fried chicken can be negative to you is if you're a Vegan or a vegetarian and you don't want to eat a chicken. That's the only way it makes sense that that would be a negative because otherwise like fried chicken, it's fucking delicious. Who doesn't like fried chicken? If you eat meat, fried chicken is something you smell it. You. Oh, if someone's really good at making it and they got a nice flaky lay on the outside, you bite into that juicy, perfectly cooked chicken fried chicken in Tennessee, Tennessee, a little fried chicken, Jesus Christ. There's places that know how to do some fried chicken. God, how could that be bad? How could that ever be racist? I. That doesn't make any sense.

Speaker 2:          01:25:33       We got to let that go. I'm going to tell you a racist but not really like sad. That went to the park with my daughter. I'm sitting there. This was sitting on Sunday with the beanie and his wife with glasses was Sherman oaks and had a $10 bills to pocket that wanted to work my fucking pickpocketing skills. I want to say still pickpocket motherfucker. I even have my daughter bumper into his leg and stuff. You can't pick pocketed, jude. Doug, you can't do it. You know, when I was a kid, that was my first fucking dream to

Speaker 1:          01:26:04       pickpocket movie with our boy that and Michael Cyrusone who are the. The first pickpocket movie is called Harry in your pocket with a boy in your flint. Flint, James Coburn. Teams. Colburn was in a pickpocket. Nobody knows about it. Hit the American's greatest secret and they would work airports and shit like that every pocket. So I hunted down my mom. I used to hear them talk about this Cuban pickpocket guy and Cuba Cuban, the 15. Oh yeah. Tremendous. Tremendous. You do with him. You did something with him, right? Oh yeah. I did two things with him. I did American gun with him and I did a list with him. All this is up. You could find out that's online. Somebody just posted in the wallet, I forgot about our list. That's one of those shows that I forgot about, but I watched him and I asked this guy out.

Speaker 1:          01:26:54       He become a pickpocket. I bumped into him at a Cuban joint. There was a rumor going around that he was a good Cuba pickpocket and Cuban. He goes, you've got to get a dummy and put bells on the pockets. That's where I went and I don't know how I got it. A little dummy and I put bells on and fucking years. I tried to be a pick pocket, but I have begun hands. Yeah, you got to have those slender, slender, slender, her fingers. Little tells on fucking pockets and you bump into them and shit. I'm very light footed that I am. I was a good burger because I can tip toe. You know what I'm saying? Like that's where my ears are. Tip Toeing on the dummy. So trying to take the wallet from the dummy. I could just never fucking dummy. It's great that you're doing so many different things though.

Speaker 1:          01:27:36       It's really cool to hear your role. Then doing some more time and the rolling has really improved because at first you can't roll. I, I dropped the weight because I figured for every five pounds I'd be a little bit more cardio. Get. Plus I got the mouthpiece. I spoke to them yesterday again. He liked that thing. Huh? I really believe in it. I use it while you're working out or do you usually what? I walk. You're walking. When I walk, I take a walk in the morning, 20 slash 30 minutes explaining to people what it is, the boss, the boss route and mouthpieces on Amazon that says webpage. I saw it because he was on joe talking about it. I was having such a struggle with my breathing. I was having such a struggle, but it was just common sense. Number one, I smoked cigarettes for 20 years.

Speaker 1:          01:28:21       Number two, I smoked for 40 years, but all those are just excuses. The number one thing was the weight. Every fucking second is some smart guys at hand. Some bastard. He's such a handsome motherfucker. He's a great guy too. He's one of the best people I know. Some guys say to me, great guy, a great brown belt, told me that whenever he rose, he could feel the difference when he's 10 pounds every. Oh yeah, for sure. Whenever I go to my mother's and I come back that first week, it's brutal really. And I go, so if I'm walking around with three or nine trying to be fucking Eddie, it's not gonna work. So I just started shopping the way I went back to weight. I

Speaker 3:          01:29:01       walked in there at three, 10, have a bunch of different rules now, like what you can eat, what you can eat. I'm going to tell you something. You can eat as many eggs as you will see you in the face and the face will look in the face and tell you because you know, you and I always had this conversation. If you're heavy and you don't go to weight watchers because you're a fucking loser. Whoa, that's it. It's that easy. It's that easy because I'm an idiot. I'm going to enjoy it. I'm a fucking idiot. And pop hip hop. Come on. That's my guy. That's my guy. So, so you, uh, put everything you eat into this app, to the APP. Oh Nice. Okay. Let me show you what I was. I got dinner, snacks total. And then you, uh, you counted on by points. Is that what they do is they do it themselves.

Speaker 3:          01:29:50       You know how many points you get in a day? Thirty nine. Now let's say Joey, would you eat that? Give me a can of coffee right there. Give me that one problem. You don't think? Okay, we don't know. So you scan that and then it'll tell you how many. I don't think that has many calories. Does coffee, plain coffee of calories? Not really. Maybe a couple, but not really. When you get the fucking milkshake coffees for breakfast and he and the fucking flat white, the flat white don't cut you. All right. This isn't in that. You go like this, boom. And then you got this Joe Rogan. You're ready. You press this over here and you press this here and you press this here and they give you points for whatever you do. Walk Circuit Training. Then you have custom. So I press Brazilian Jujitsu. Lets you go to an hour class.

Speaker 3:          01:30:40       How much do you really fuck them? Roll. Fifteen minutes. People don't know what class you're doing. Technique. He teaches you how to do the drill and he tells you a joke. So you press and 15 done and then you press the intensity. Will you breathed on? Adam? I just bet seven points. You leave this in your phone, in your pocket. You put this in your pocket and fucking guess what happens? It counts the steps. When I went to Disneyland, that burge dirty one fucking points. So it's all the executive for breakfast. So for breakfast I go to John's and I got to see that role. Even if I give myself full fucking points for the row, five points, six points for the role. I put two eggs on that motherfucking, which is 14 grams of protein. I put a thin slice of humans. Boys had an American cheese and some frank's hot sauce on that motherfucker.

Speaker 3:          01:31:30       I ain't gonna. Talk to me. Talk to me. So you essentially can eat anything you want as long as you know what the points are. I get a certain amount of points. Fish, I cut out fish you for days, so I'll leave here and go to fucking Sushi Dan, and I'll get the crunchy albacore, which is. I can't wait for Rogan to visit me. It sliced albacore covered with Jalapenos, onion and garlic cloves. It's possible. Let me ask you this. Is it possible that you could eat just all eggs all day and it has zero point, zero point? Really eggs all day, all day. That sounds crazy. Fish all day. Sea Bass, all you could eat salmon and sea bass all day. Chicken breast, no skin, no skin all motherfucking day. All Day. Chicken breasts, not chicken cutlets. Mom made with Italian breadcrumbs. No, no, no, no. That's fried grilled chicken breast with red crushed peppers and a baked potato.

Speaker 3:          01:32:27       Five points for the baked potato. Oh, so you want to tell me again how listening. It's not a journey. It's not a fucking race. She before. It's only healthy. Lose like a pound, pound and a half a week. Is that what it is? That's what it really. They say anything after that, you go into that loser show where they lost all that weight at one shot and then that's why all these diets and stuff that you have to do on something that you're going to do forever. I've always liked this. I lost 100 pounds with this. Yeah, and then I gained 40 and now I lost another 30. That's awesome. And it hasn't been killing me like I don't miss nothing. You know, when I learned I didn't know this, I will go get an outside. He bought American thinks announcer. Ebola was great. Let me explain something to you.

Speaker 3:          01:33:14       Eating a banana and putting them banana. The blend is two different things. I did not know that when that was making one of those, because I switched. I have on it proteins, which I use the vanilla or the chocolate, the Mexican chocolate, and then I had this other one that's a polio type protein. It's coconut milk and I put a use that one in one day. So let me put a bland in this motherfucker just to see it. I'm like, damn, this is delicious. I'm onto something. I gained weight that week. I didn't know what it was. I'm the banana. When you blend the banana, it's eight points, but when you eat a banana, it's gods, but it's for you because when you eat fruit and when you drink fruit, it's two different things. That's why walgreens fat people, when you see him going, I don't eat breakfast.

Speaker 3:          01:34:02       I drink a smoothie. You're killing yourself. You were killing yourself every time you puree fruit because when you eat fruit, the sativa, it's alive. It's saliva's. God forbid the saliva in your mouth breaks the fruit down and digestive the sugar a different way. When you bypass that enzyme in your mouth, that's when you get 300 pounds like uncle joey. So when you drink fruit, I don't care if they tell you, oh, it's frozen fruit. You lose some of the sugar. That's bullshit. Once you fucking blend that fruit, you dead because it goes right into your sister. Go out as the assistant, all the fiber and was like, why? Why? Why? You're not supposed to learn that shit any other way other than the way that comes when you eat it. You can go to that fucking little Mexican stand with the umbrellas. You ever see those guys?

Speaker 3:          01:34:53       The cartel could delivery. Is that what that is? Yeah. That's when the cartel drops that money. Shake him down and I got three that guys over there cutting fruit with a machete. Go ahead. I dare you to go up. When you see a cod, tell umbrella that that's a cartel money that, that they got tons of money in those days. They just confuse people. They even got them across the street from one another. Well that starbucks. Don't you think they're just poor people and trying to make some money? Not really. You're not going to get me apples. You've got to sell the fucking pay rent in this 10 days and times. Nobody stands out there. Look at those. Mexicans don't even use SPF. They're out there raw with no fucking umbrella out there. They look darker than dark. They get dark. Were you thinking you? You know, but you got to pay me to standing out there on fucking thing.

Speaker 3:          01:35:35       This weather a lot. They got like $200 a day, $300 a day. Not because they're cutting the apples up because the guy comes with a Poncho and takes what's underneath them and takes it straight to Mexico on Thursdays. Nobody sees nothing that every time you eat that fruit and sprinkled with cocaine. He told me that fruit. Well now watch the energy. You get like that box of roaring for be poor farmers because that's how nice people are using. For me, I'm a criminal. I see people for what it is. I see things for what is. I'm trying to sell the leader or rehab because I got a friend that's got to rehab. You go down there, so send lead to him because he could make money. There's a rehab, there's a bunch of rehabs or Florida you go to and they get your insurance and they bang your insurance for 60 and then they give you a cut back at 30.

Speaker 3:          01:36:22       I totally let me send you down into my buddy's. Give me 10 percent. I get three grid, get acupuncture to give you a few massages or do you give a fuck the rehab business? Imagine who would be in terms of his marijuana consumption. Imagine where he would be if it wasn't for you, like terrorists. That guy when you first started having him on your show when you guys first started doing smoke pot, maybe three times in college, a couple months in. He's done superhero doses of edibles. Couple months. I mean like little by little, little by little bit. When you would sneak him in on him and you would take away at 2:50 and pointed a $500. What I would do, wrap it, I get this is Joey Diaz, Costar and the Church of what's happening now is completely asleep at the wheel. He's on the show and his eyes are almost totally closed, is barely a slip. They just dazed. Who's the guest? Who is that? It's right in Bosnia. A kid that I told on this podcast, he can't take him though high. What is the name of this video? Jamie Lee space. Outer Space.

Speaker 3:          01:37:45       Look at him. Go. He's guy. I would get these. Okay. I would go in the afternoons and I would get a one 80 and I would rip the cover off the one 80 and I would take a 67 slash 60 milligram woman. I'd eat that one. It was like two in the afternoon. They don't do nothing to me. I'll eat like a 60 and I'd take the one 80 and pulling the 60 rapper. Oh No. And then I bring it to him, put it on the table and in front of them I go here and then open it up for him and he wouldn't see it. It was half open the reading, give them the 60,

Speaker 4:          01:38:20       but it was like last night I gave him an expired where they had a little bit of mold on it. He's going to be a good comment a bro. Look at eleanor. Eleanor sat there for 15 years, shut her mouth and watched. There's a really special gift to that. What do you think was funny in it? Whether you agree with her. I give her the balls. A lot of people don't like just sitting there and watching. There's a lot of people that do though, you know, there's a lot of people that work in and around comedy clubs that probably want to do it. They just don't know how to get started, you know, they just don't have it in them to get the ball rolling. It's hard. It's hard to. Hard to try something new. He keeps thinking about when's the right time to do it.

Speaker 4:          01:39:10       Is it now? Maybe. Should I wait a week, you know, you know what? I want to lose 10 pounds and then I'm going to try it. And you get all these things in your head. How long did it take you? Seriously? Honest, honest, honest engine. Well, my birthday was August 11th and uh, when I turned 21 was August 11th of 2019 88 rather. So I got on stage August 27th. So from my birthday too, when I got on stage, it was just a few days. It was just terrified. Terrified. I was trying to check it out. I'm Jonathan Katz was the emcee and um, I was maybe going to get up. It was one of those things were signed up for the list, you know, you get, I think it was five minutes and there's a bunch of people that are going to do five minutes and Jonathan Katz who was already an established standup comedian, really funny guy, and he was the host and he's like, um, he came up to me, he said, let me check in a half an hour in to see if I can get your.

Speaker 4:          01:40:08       Cause sometimes people wouldn't show up. And so a half an hour in, I'm, I'm thinking I'm just going to check it out. I'm just going to bail. I'm just gonna tell him forget about it. And when I'm thinking this in my head, I walked up to him and he's, I got you in jail. So, uh, you'll be going up right here and you'll have five minutes. Good luck. And I said, well, all right, thank. Thanks man. Okay, so I was ready to push out, dude. I was totally ready to push you out and I was so nervous. The first time I went on stage, I was fucking terrified. I couldn't believe it was the name of the place. Stitches, stitches, comedy club. August 27, 19, 88. I was terrified. Terrified. I couldn't believe I was scared. I didn't. It didn't make any sense to me. I didn't think I was going to be scared. I thought maybe it'd be like a little

Speaker 1:          01:40:54       nervous, like I'd never performed before. So this idea of doing and it was like, well, you know, I've, I've taught taekwondo classes in front of people before I can talk in front of people. And then I thought about the idea to stand up in front of people, so don't fuck it took me. It's crazy. It took me a year to think about it because then it snowed. I couldn't go to work because we can't roof in Colorado. Right. Should I read to the punchline with Tom Hanks and sally fields? Angel Salazar. Damon Wayans, a bunch of people in that movie. I watched punchline and that pissed me the fuck off. That was it. I went into the yellow pages. I found comedy clubs. I called them and comedy works offered a Tuesday night open mic. How do I get on? You have to call in and they'll give you three minutes.

Speaker 1:          01:41:51       Okay, so for two months I called him nothing. And then one night there like Joe Diaz and I called him back that night I got sick. I got the float was like I'm not going out of their. Wow. And then I was roofing, roofing, roofing, roofing, Mr Madan jobs. I'm going to different jobs and dropping off material. I'd like to cruise working and I went to one crew when they go, hey man, we're stuck here, this job. Can you get us the morning break? And I go, yeah, I'll go over there. And I went over to this little diner right off the fucking dirty, whatever that I 77, 25. Which one? But when the Denver it was like our industrial area trucks everywhere. I don't remember what the number of that road is. A road there, but there was a place around the corner. Jamie had the best fucking Green Chili.

Speaker 1:          01:42:44       You add your fucking life and when you pulled him over fucking scrambled eggs, you dick would get fucking fuck. Two to a t is, are you kidding me? That goes fucking to walk over there. I sit down and you know, there's always a paper in front of you ever go to a diner or something. There's always a paper. Somebody read and I sit down, I give the waitress. I'm sitting in, I look over and I went like this just on a, you know, you just go like that to the middle. And when I opened it it said, do you want to be a standup comic? Whoa. And it was an article on Roseanne became a standup comic and now because of Denver, she had just blown up like Rosanna had just blown up. It was maybe march of 91. Rosanna had just blown up. Denver was a hotbed Jack.

Speaker 1:          01:43:39       Everybody was drinking the water or be wanting to see what Rosanne was doing. So it had a big thing about Roseanne and it had all these open mic spot and it had the classes that you could take and there was a class in boulder for $33, three Sundays in a row at the University of Colorado. Part of the continuing education, the guy that taught it, his name is jeff harms and I went the first Sunday that okay with the second Sunday did okay. In the third Sunday I performed on the way out. He took me aside and he goes, I don't know how serious you are about this, but you're onto something. If you want to do it, let me know. And I left there going, I want to sell coke. Fucking crack jokes, cracked fucking jokes, pickpocket or fucking fucking come up with birds and shit. I swear to God.

Speaker 1:          01:44:36       I'm like, are you fucking crazy? I don't know if I can be a comedian. And then about a month later I saw an ad in the paper for Dorman for comedy clubs. I called it up and they said, come up on the way there. I called Jeff. He gave me his number because he said, when we got on stage, just me, I'll put you up somewhere and I go, there's a job for a doorman at wit's end. Do you think I could get it? And he goes to the alcohol. The Guy Right now, you got it. Just dragged them, fill out the APP, you tell them you're friends with me and it made me a doorman slash sound guy in the bar back quit. So I was the door guy, sound guy in the bar back and after about six months I had two jobs. I hated going home.

Speaker 1:          01:45:24       I had a marriage that was just fucking just like the one that we all talk about when you cannot go home, it's not your home anymore. I would basically leave at six, come home at five, take a shower, eat whatever fucking crap she cooked, give the baby a kiss and I get in my truck and go back to Westminster. It was a club away from the comedy works. It was in Westminster, but it wasn't. It didn't get the best people in the world. You know what I'm saying? You have to lose people in there. People will poach bands and shit like that. So I still have. And then in the middle of all that, it took me two months to get a spot from Wendy and then I went down at Nicholson army, one of the original owners. Mr Wendy with comedy comedy, comedy works in Denver.

Speaker 1:          01:46:13       He was one of the original owners, but when he had Nicholson, he told me to keep coming back, but I knew when I walked off that stage, that life as I knew it has ad ended. How so? Whatever I thought life was at that point. I had gone out the window like I. Saturday was fucked up for me because Saturday I was supposed to be somewhere this week, but I couldn't go. I had to go to my friend's mother's 80th birthday party and why it was important. It was in Philly. It was away from philly. She's in an old folks home. They're the second family that took me in when my mom died, but they took me in a crucial spot. Gel, you're throwing me out. I'm 17 and I know where to go. I couldn't go to my stepfather, so I had an aunt in New York and I can live with and I had a godmother in Harlem and I didn't want to live with both on the job.

Speaker 1:          01:47:12       Like I wasn't mad. I just mentioned to a friend one day we were out snorting coke drinking and I told him, I know what I'm saying, they gonna throw me out of the data and he wasn't even good friends with me and about a week later I saw him at school. I think it was a man. I talked to my father. You could move in with us. That was whose birthday? It was on Saturday, so when I got off the phone with her I was thinking about how important they were to me, but I still remember being 17 and sitting on that hill on 86th and county blvd. Thinking about how I had nowhere to go bro. Like This was my only shot. Like I had nowhere to go nowhere. There wasn't like a homeless shelter. I didn't know where the fuck to go. I probably had $10 in my pocket and then the younger brother ran up, down.

Speaker 1:          01:48:00       When he goes dog, they're waIting for you to come to eat the dinner. I'm over there. I had never met the parents. How lucky am I? I never met the parents. That's pretty lucky and I walked in and they had like six kids and there wasn't like what I was used to living. They had nowhere to conditioning. The parents were blue collar and they took me in. I made me a part of that home, never asked me for rent, wasn't the fucking best house on the bLock, but to this day I'm tight with all the four brothers and sisters. It's like, well, we're all one big family, but then kind of fucking lucky like I'm not even talking about being thankful for the comedy bridge. Just a personal bridge over like I was a killer and in and at that point I had lost all faith in humanity. Like I was done. like I wasn't a catholic no more. I was just waiting to kill somebody. That's it. That's all I was waiting, man. It's such a weird, like I'm not even worried about the comedy bridge. No more was the personaL bridge where I grew the most, you know, I don't even know how we got In this conversation. This week is killing me. It's good weed.

Speaker 3:          01:49:09       They're going to kill the good weed now. Right. Is that what's happening? How does this work? How does it. No, no, no. I still got some guys. Yeah, I'm sure you do legally, but illegally for. It'll still be available for medicinal people that have. we've got to get a card. Recreational. It's going to be to renew that card. Son. I go, I got to redo that car. I don't want any of your bullshit weed. I don'T want to eat your fucking water down. We'd. What are they going to do? They've got to water it down. 18 percent. Something like that, but never fear. But here's the thing. Isn't that strong? Look at this. we've got a da went to. Oh wow. Will you think you're dealing with his joy? Bananas. We got state, federal.

Speaker 2:          01:49:48       We've got them coming from all over. You know what I'm saying? Damn tea. Fuck you. Just in case, just in case with tom cruise, the american made. I was looking up the medicinal rules in Ohio recently. You can't grow your own there if you have a card. Yeah, they're sneaky with that shit, right? Yeah. Hopefully people eventually voted that out, but you had to get it in there first. That's the only way It would have passed. They have everything wired up, but it's a. It's a victory because it's gonna be very difficult to make it illegal. Now that it's legal, it's going to be very difficult to go backwards. So then you have to figure out like why do these companies have a monopoly on making it as if it's legal, why can't you make it yourself? Aren't tomatoes legal? I can grow tomatoes. Can I.

Speaker 2:          01:50:33       You could even probably grow, like, do you need a tax stamp or something to grow tobacco? How does that work? Maybe to sell it. I don't know. If you want it to grow your own tobacco, would you be able to do that? Like if you said, I want to make my own fucking pipes and fill them with my own tobacco, I want to make my own cigars. Could you do that? It's a possible for personal use. That's crazy. So if you could do that federally and then they're saying you can't in Ohio, you can't grow your own weed. That's so stupid. That's so dumb. Like you even know what you're doing. Know I don't know dick about it. I wouldn't do it, but you should be able to. If it's legal, of course you should be able to grow it. That's it's a fucking plant.

Speaker 2:          01:51:23       Not blow it. Where can you not grow? In Ohio, if you have a card, here's the worry. The worry is that you wouldn't charge taxes. You would keep the money. You wouldn't be accurate. You just do it with cash. You do cash transactions. That's the worry, but that would be a tax worry more that. Right? Is that what it is, what they're saying tobacco to? Yeah. You can grow as much as you want. You just can't sell it. Oh, okay. But you did not even allowed to grow their own for personal use when it comes to marijuana, so it's more restrictive than tobacco, which is, hi larry, this silly fucks. That's so dumb. Does that make any sense to you? Listen, we have some wacky laws that we let sneak through, like why would you let other people decide that different people in this group can't grow a plant that's legal now, get the fuck outta here. That's dumb. That's a dumb rule. They can't some edibles over a hundred. No weed. That's loose. So if I come into your store and I go, what do you got? You can open up the container and show me the butter. Let me smell it.

Speaker 2:          01:52:27       They all have to be sealed and stuff. There's just a lot of silly rules. I don't know which one to stay. Don't. I'm very happy I found this bag of expired. Fucking sheba. Choose to listen. You know me? I make it work. Are they diminished in any way? No,

Speaker 1:          01:52:46       no, no. A couple of her. A little bit of mold. Donald, would you just take them old glove? I put a little brown nail polish on it and nobody knows about that. Like Who gives a fuck? A little mold. never killed. Nobody motel people. Penicillin. Penicillin came from some old, didn't it? Something like that. It's so crazy how you see your kids. You see it with your kids. I took my kid to science camp and when I came from Cuba, I had a lot of problems medically here when I came to this country and one of them was the allergies. The allergies were completely different than what I was used to. A different country. Their fucking mind boggling. So my allergies. Have you ever hit me? Made that noise? You ever do that? Because I don't. I can't scratch the back of my throat like normal people.

Speaker 1:          01:53:33       Normal people do that noise. So you all sealed up up there. The first week of camp I saw my daughter to do shit. I felt so bad for her. She would try to scratch her nose and I would see her get frustrated. Joe rogan just scratching and scratching and scratching and now it's three weeks in the summer camp. She don't scratch. No. How come? Because you build up your immune system. It's so weird how you see it in front of you. Now you see, I see. I saw in front of me like I went right to my wife and I go, let me tell you something, you want to take it to the fucking doctor and get a fucking tonsils out because that's the shit that started with me at that age when I came from Cuba right away I was in the hospital on a weekly level dog weekly between the tonsils and the fucking allergies and asthma and the asthma, but my mother didn't pay attention to the.

Speaker 1:          01:54:27       But that's why I don't have it today. Like I might have bits and pieces, but I don't have it. mercy's got it. My daughter's got it. They got to do the inhaler and the whole thing as most fucking rough. It's rough. That's rough. I've seen people have asthma attacks and you can hear the wheezing and you have no fucking idea. So I have to work it from a different angle. What can, what can they do? LIke if someone doesn't have an inhaler and they have an asthma attack, a strategy or technique referenced and mother fucking party. Oh no. So you have to be like, I was having a party right there. Have a great tIme. I got an estimate. Their inhaler opens up your lungs, children, my wife has the machine, the machine, the machine that blows some powder in there with a thing. And then there's a regular machine that my wife has. And then she has dna. Uh, you know, my wife and her doctor been working on different things. She's healthy kids. Healthy is fuck. She runs, she swims jujitsu. That ballet, you know, it's, it's four days a week. We don't stop at that fucking house. You know, you just, you see it, you know people. I love these people that

Speaker 3:          01:55:44       say, oh, let's meet at 3:30. You tell your mother ministry 33, 30 is my day really starts because I'm saying I'm writing jokes at eight that. Because I want that because that's what I got. Yeah, that's what I got. That's what I got because I got this, that, this, that, and at 3:00 from monday to friday this different activity. Sometimes you do three at a time, bro. We gonna write from jujitsu right to the pool. When she jumps in, you think we could do me then go for 45 minutes. Fuck you, jack. You gotta. See it. It's unbelievable. People like, nah, let's meet. Fuck you. I got ballet. I got a thousand fucking activities during the week. Kids are little energy machine and if you don't burn that energy then you deal with it and from seven to nine when you fucking trying to do your own shit and trying to get it together, they're just constantly ready to go. THey're ready to go. A couple of weeks ago she took her to the fucking zoo. Six hour walk around la zoo. I get home at four. He's like, what's the story? We're going to the park. I looked at my wife like park, took it to the park, two hours on the monkey bars and then another hour at the fucking yogurt place jumpIng up and down to music and Michael Jackson and drawing pictures.

Speaker 3:          01:57:01       Really? It's crazy being a fucking debt especially because then I'll know I kidnap some bio. She's. She has no idea. She has no idea. I'm a savage, so she thinks I'm on the up and up, like when we go to church and shit, she's like, daddy, look at jesus as well.

Speaker 4:          01:57:15       Nothing turns people more on the up and up. then being a father, it really does. Yeah. It changes who you are. You're responsible for these people now and you just do. You have to think of things differently. You have to make sure that you provide. Do you have To make sure that they're taken care of? You've got to give them love. It's like, ooh, it's an intense world and you feel more vulnerable and it's just the whole world around you opens up and you also have more empathy. I have way more empathy for people now because I'm becoming. You know, as you're raising children, you're seeIng how they develop and then you considering how other people have been mistreated and how things have gone terribly wrong. They've been abused and beaten and fucked up and then left and terrible situations, and you realize that so much of what happens with people with even terrible behavior comes from other terrible behavior like they didn't get a chance to stop the cycle and there are a lot of people that we consider like really bad people, violent people, people that do terrible things that we don't even realize that so many of them are product of violence, like they're a product of someone doing it to them like they've.

Speaker 4:          01:58:33       They've almost, they're trying to get back at the world for all the horrible shit that's been done to them and there was no one there to put a stop to it. There was no one there to save them. There was no one there to protect them and this is what we're seeing. When we see fucked up people, we always just think of it as fucked up people would. That fucked up person is the product of some terrible things that have happened to them. Almost universally. Almost every angry, fucked up person has come from a place where something has gone really wrong against them. You don't, you're not angry and fucked up. If everything's awesome, if every day just get an ice cream, getting your dick sucked and driving a ferrari and watching awesome movies like you know, it's, you, there's a, there's an anger that some people have violent criminals in particular that comes from someone doing that to them.

Speaker 1:          01:59:22       I had a job. I know you had that anger from 1979.

Speaker 4:          01:59:29       You had that shit when I met you. I had that angle. But no, the met you. I've seen it. I've seen it with people. Let me explain some to wanted to attack people.

Speaker 1:          01:59:39       Anger was very, uh alright. First of all, under control. I was always a happy kid and, but not really because I was always confused about the death of my father. So had always had a little certain unhappiness. Yeah. But I always had the catholic faith. I was really raised catholic and I always believed he was in the habit that he was in that box from my mom did the things, so at ease the pain a little bit. Then my mother's death was just fucking horrifying and that broke the central nervous system belief system that broke your belief in the world. how can there be a god that takes a mother away from a chIld when you're 16 and you wrap that around? Your head does not a good result. It's not going to be a good result. So how I lashed out with, by robin you, that was the only weapon I had world was to rob you.

Speaker 1:          02:00:36       Joe rogan, fucktard, me. The studio will get robbed and lit on fucking fire and joe knew was me. And what the fuck was he going to do? I'm, we combine the fuck you going to do it? Call the cops. I'm going to answer the phone next time. Don't fuck with me. You know, next time when I tell you to give me that grandma coke and I'll pay you on friday, you'll give it to me, right? Because that's what it was. IT was simple shit like that, right? Like joe, give me 100 bucks or $100 bucks. Okay, now rob, your fucking house should have given him 100 bucks. You know, I was lashing out at the fucking world number two. The other issue I had is I lost a child. I lost the job. I was not ready for that child at all. I love that little girl with all my heart, but I was not ready for her at all. My intentions are good, but the result was not going to be well. I was noT ready and because I lost that child and I'm a no contact with that child, it makes me a better father than I am today. This is never going to happen to me again. You understand me?

Speaker 2:          02:01:40       I see. I see the, we see daughters of comics, we've seen daughters of comments and sons of comics and if fucking lost, you know, I don't want my daughter to be fucking lost and that stupidity in that world, you know, you have to be that job. We have to be there. Yeah. You know, I'm trying to be there as much as I can be engaged. You have to be engaged. Were your parents engaged as much as you're engaged? In my mind, but I didn't want a different world. Yes, it's a different world, but my parents were very openminded what? What my parents gave to me that was really important was they. They are like the most nonjudgmental, non racist, non homophobic people ever. They don't judge about anything. They were hippies. You know? When my mom met my stepdad, he had crazy long hair and he had it like all are all too.

Speaker 2:          02:02:38       I was like almost in high school. It was when he cut, I was so happy when he caught it. I was like, people were. It was like back then dudes grew their hair long. They were hippies, like legit hippies. But because of that I was raised around like no racism, no homophobic. We had a no homophobic thoughts in our house. We never. That never came up. We lIved in san francisco from the time I was seven until I was 11. We lived on a series gate and the one thing that did disturb me though, once I was walking with my stepdad, some dude whistle that adam was like, I knew the dudes were gay, but there's a thing about when a dude is hitting on your straight stepdad and you're like, oh my goodness, this is ridiculous. Like guys are growth. It makes you realize, doesn't even really make you realize what it would like to be a chicken.

Speaker 2:          02:03:34       That same exact grew up completely different. Not in my home, not my home, but the surrounding. You know, when I would walk down the corner, mr tina and we'll go pick a rule where you going, you know, there was a kid and I still talk to him on facebook. His name was louis and in this he's dominican cho, he's dominican, he's dominican. They didn't give a fuck. They called him louie the nigga constantly, louis the negativity. The guys, he's dominican. If they gave a fuck, they didn't give a fuck. They didn't give a fuck. So funny. You know, they didn't give a fuck a pro or just different than. It's a different world. We're talking about right. I remember there was a kid that is today gay. I still talk to him. He's my brother. As a matter of fact, he's one of my brothers. I gotta be honest with you. He lives in miami. He's got hiv. I mean, listen, if you didn't know he was gay when he was 12, there's something wrong with you. Ms dot tina used to call him. He was lightened the slippers looking.

Speaker 3:          02:04:38       Look at jimmy, he's white and this slip is, you know, and you had to sit there and take it. It was whatever. It should be. Okay. for a little jimmy lightness slippers. Everybody should just let him be who he was. He had a dog named tramp that wouldn't have his dog ever. He lived outside tramp skin. Like when you pet the fucking thing was the hardest. It was like a, like with those brushes you scrub the metal brush, like you've lived outside tramp. But he followed him everywhere. He was beautiful. I love dogs, but you're very lucky because I did the best. I grew up in an environment standing with you when my man on the corner, we see a trans gender person crossed mystery, like look at the shape of this fucking guy. As simple as that is as a judgment, but that judgment, but it was more of a sense of humor.

Speaker 3:          02:05:32       You know, before we were looking at a picture of a of archie bunker, America understood it because he knew where he was coming from. He wasn't saying nothing malicious. It was a world where he came from and the idea was that he was reluctantly open to occasionally taking new information. Today, every guy's sItting at home fucking looking at a window, pick him, waiting to fuck him to get me. Dude, there's a thousand men at home waiting right now to get me fucking to everyday a new guy get called out for something like that. What's this going to be like in five years? Nobody's going to be able to even ask for fucking piece, right? Nobody's going to go, hey, let me give you a little stab. Let me give you a little buckaloo wish. I think

Speaker 4:          02:06:19       going to come a time and then I don't think it's going to be very long within 10 years where we're going to be able to read each other's minds. I think we're going to be able to communicate in a different way and I think it's just going to be step one into some sort of a technological world where we all read each other's minds. We can connect together and some almost like telepathic web way. The way you use a. This is obviously just an idea, but I think that if technology continues to give us closer and closer access to people, we're gonna lose all boundaries between what a person is and you're going to know everything about everyone's past and everyone's going to know everything about yours and it's going to be like some unlimited library of the mind. You can. You can travel through anyone's mind and read anyone's thoughts and as hundred years goes by and the technology gets better and a thousand years go by, we're going to integrate.

Speaker 4:          02:07:13       We're gonna fIgure out a way whether it's in our grandchildren's lifetimes or their grandchildren's lifetimes. And I think that cultural shifts and things that are happening in the news and people waking up to things that they think are horrible and people trying to correct the misdeeds of the past. All of that is us waking up in the middle of our culture and trying to figure out what's right, figuring out what's the healthy way to move forward, figure balance this thing out. Slow down. What are we doing? We're waking up as grown adults trying to figure out our system and there's some injustices. Those injustices have to be corrected or at least recognized. We have to understand what's the difference between normal male female interaction and what sexual harassment. What when is it when someone doesn't want you to do it, when does it become a crime and you don't want your daughter to ever experienced that and I don't want anybody that's a woman to experience real sexual harassment. It's the worst fucking thing that could probably ever happen to you because you can't do anything physically about it other than rape or being beaten up or murdered too creepy place to be in. I've had guys hit on me before. Have you ever had a guy hit on you before? We use.

Speaker 3:          02:08:27       Where is this going? I was like 13. I didn't know what to do. I ran out of the car and it was my fault for getting in the fucking car. I also acknowledged it never fucking happened again and I would go to gay this when I was a kid, like we thought it was a joke to go to a fucking porn theater on a sunday. Here we got to a point on a sunday, like we're stupid friends and going to the bathroom and there's always a guy that gets next to you in the store when you go pick and it looks at your dick and he smiles. Come on guys. I bumped into a lot of creep. You been out here. first of all, I tell you what bothers me about the current situation now. Went off that this fucking place. He has always been a fucking haven for sexual harassment.

Speaker 3:          02:09:06       This fucking neighbor down the corridor here in hollywood is with sexual harassment. Got invented. Did you ever see, um, all the stuff about fatty arbuckle? I heard pieces about fattier but, but I don't need to know about fatty. I know about a chick named Marilyn Monroe that they passed around, so they killed the, I know about a game, a liberace. We used to suck his dick and fucking clean you out and then send you out the fucking cold and worse get plastic surgery. So you looked like you look like him, but is one of the most intense things a person's ever made a person to. Let me tell you something. Let me tell you something else too. That's while we welcome the elephants in the room. The fucking we hang out was known for comedy. Fucking hell of them. Convicted a lot of years. The comedy store, a lot of dick sucker went down to fucking calm you store.

Speaker 3:          02:09:55       I don't know how long harvey weinstein been around, but there's a song by the eagles in 1980 that was released on the fucking long run than last. Now it's called the king of hollywood on the way home. Put it on. listen to it in the car. You're going to crash your car, called the king of fucking hollywood and you're going to go, hold on. Fuck. Were they talking about? I have to assume I'm going to. It just breaks it down. It would be a shame to see all that talent go to waste. You know? What are you willing to sacrifice would really be just nice. Oh, you got. Look at this shit down here beside me. Honey. Let's have a little heart to heart. That's the fucking lyrics to this song. Well, Kenya, hollywood, 1980. Nobody knew. Now look at me and tell me, darlene, how badly do you want this part?

Speaker 3:          02:10:48       Yeah. What's listened to put men in positions of power and hiring women like that and that, that crazy position of what you're trying to cast something and you've got a hundred people that want it so bad and you're. You know, you're some creepy dudes. Some people actually think this would change their life if I came to you right now, Joe rogan. You're fucking delivering papers in boston. You'd have to show her podcast. There's all you to do is look my fucking bowl. Oh my goodness. Just swap one time, but I want you to. Do I want you to do that thing at the end. like a dice? Yeah. Like would you do it? How much think, how much do I get and how long do I have to suck them for? Did he says it's going to be over pretty quick. This is the career changer. If I may do this, do that. Right? That's who they're talking about. Oh, the king of hollywood. It was clark gable a um, was he a gay man? It was based off a book. Apparently all this stuff that was in there, but he was, he alleged to be a gay man. Is this.

Speaker 3:          02:12:00       But there was also a book released in hollywood in 1997 or eight called. You'll never work in this town again. Oh. So those lyrics were about clark gable. Yo, I'm sorry. I thought it was something. Yeah. Yeah. But then there was a book released in 1997 or eight in this hollywood called. You'll never work in this town again. And there was about a chick who described her sexual relationships with a bunch of people in town and she described it was fucking don henley, the drummer from the eagles, the guy that sings and he would get hooked us to come up to the house, wouldn't even talk to them, but why them up, turn around, don't even look at me, don't even make fucking eye contact on me. They understand me. Bend over. So he would sIt on the couch, we road bond with his dick out snorting coke and they would all be in front of a fireplace.

Speaker 3:          02:12:56       Breadth over, where'd you hear this? Because this book will never work in this town again. Jesus christ. And he would fuck it. You never eat lunch at this time again. Oh, you never eat lunch. And he would take the thing, do a line of coke, get up and walk up to one of them, spread them, putting them in their ass a little bit. Firstly, puppet twice, and then go, I'll be back in five minutes. and then he would go sit down, put his feet up, do another line. And he would do that for eight hours, just get up, fuck one for five minutes and sit back then before he'd come. So he would never crack a nut and he would just keep going to keep a heart on a live fucking. Who the fuck knows? Listen, you know, it's like they all through the harvey under the bus.

Speaker 3:          02:13:41       But these animaLs had been doing this, says jesus loves chicago. Since jesus miss chicago, this one I read that article about the cuban superman that they brand them with sleeping, with what they blatantly talked about In our article was exactly what we're seeing today. only behind closed doors that Cuba had become a haven for sex. Where you couLd go see a fucking go get fucked. They passed a rule thIs week in Mexico that a girl could get fucked up. she's 12 years old. You really need that room. Really? That's the rule. You need something that you Could be the age. 12 years old is an act of, and this is Mexico, Mexico, james, 12 years, 12 fucking years old when he just as a woman, 12 years old. That's insane. That's insane. It's

Speaker 4:          02:14:32       scary it. Oh jeez, you fucking believe that. oh my god, look at this. The federal law established at the age of 12 as the minimum age of consent, while the age at which there are no restrictions for consensual sexual activities is 18 sex with someone 12 to 18 is not illegal per se, but can still be open to prosecution under certain circumstances. He really. What does that mean? So It's, it's age 12 is the age of minimum age of consent, but the age in which there are no restrictions for consensual sex is 18. So the idea is that sex between someone who's 12 and 18, it's not illegal, but they might be able to lock you up if you do something super creepy. That is nuts, man. You imagine if there was some person that just only went after 12 years, is that the United States or Mexico?

Speaker 4:          02:15:28       It's Mexico, so that's why people would fly down. Actually I typed it in Mexico, but this is an article on wikipedia about aging consent in north America. Why federal law? So I'll find out, wait a minute, that what I just read was about north America. How is that real? I just saw north America too, and that's why I asked her states. Right? I'm sorry. Not in north America. United states of America. Right? North americas, Canada to. That is, that is uh, that is not possible thing. How is it? Is that really possible? The 12 can be the age of consent anywhere. What are you talking about? That's crazy. 18, right? That's the federal law of Mexico. Mexico. He scared the shit out of me. Jamie. Here in America. It's not yet. Yes. That's what the article is about. North America. Age of consent in north America.

Speaker 4:          02:16:11       And there is states here where it's lower than like there's a couple. I believe it's 14. Dude. Is that real? It might've changed it. Okay. So 12 for the ones. The 12 are the ones that were in white, which is, that's in Mexico right here. Yeah. Okay. There are spots and all the way up the coast. Right? You have, that's still Mexico done here. Yeah. That side. But that, that whole thing is 12 years old. Is the age of consent a blue is all 16. who? That's a lot of states. 16. Yeah. That's kind of crazy.

Speaker 4:          02:16:49       A lot of fucking us dates. That's crazy. 14. 18 central. Excuse me. was this say central America slash 14 to 18 and central America. Interesting. That's that age of consent thing is bananas. Go back to that little map again please. That is weird to look at. I would have thought there would be way less of those 16. Look how many sixteens there are and what are the darker ones? Can you scroll all the way down so we could see the whole scale? So 17. Is that around and then wow. Tax green is 18. So like Florida, California is less greens in there are blues more. The age of consent is 16. Is this current, is that possible? This is not current. It seems not. Alaska 16 to. I assumed it was all

Speaker 1:          02:17:45       Florida was like eight. You know Florida could be like seven, six and a half. You never know that. I'm fucking that crazy place. That is a fucking crazy place. That's where white people go to boogie. An interesting. I just found out about, it was a time you go down and just buy pills over the counter or something. Go pain. Doctors. Pain medication. Yeah. Like I just read this shit recently that, that, that law got abolished something. That's why so many people left Florida. There were people moving to Florida in droves. Just whose pain? Doctors in droves. I didn't know about this shit. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          02:18:26       Well, there's a great documentary that we've talked about many times called the oxycontin express and they sort of documented that whole route from Ohio and Kentucky and all the way down through georgIa. All the people that would go into Florida just to get pain pills, all you had to do is just get into Florida and you'd get a doctor and say you hurt your back and they would have a pharmacy right next to the doctor's office and all the pharmacy had his pain pills. So you go there, you tell the doctor, you're heard. The doctors is great here. Here's some fucking serious hardcore drugs that can kill you. Don't take more of these die. They're super powerful opiates. But since I wrote the wrote it on this piece of paper, you can go buy it. So you go next door and you're buying, you're buying the hardest of the hardcore. You're buying hillbilly heroin, you're buying oxycontin and you're going deep. Now. I've never done that shit. I did morphine when I got my knee operated on. They gave me that little pump thing and you could press it and press it and present and you want to get more morphine. I don't, I have no idea what oxycotton like, but that morphine

Speaker 1:          02:19:28       felt wonderful. It feels like the cognitive not feel good. What does it feel like? I one time and that was good enough for me. Some people must like it. Everybody likes different shit. You know? I like blow black, like met. What did, what did oxy do for you? Like why is it not good? I took a little tiny piece, like I'm always a fan of something that might put me to sleep. View like this caN put you to sleep. You know what? I'll give it a fucking shot. I like sleep. You try to go to sleep on oxycontin? Yeah, I didn't know. I go, what? He goes, you might pass out or he gave me a 16th. It was, there was nothing, there was nothing that I popped it and I just felt like my blood pressure dropped. Like I couldn't even do anything. So I went to sleep and I just know never to take that shit again.

Speaker 1:          02:20:18       There's certain shit I've taken that I just knew that I was never gonna that just wasn't going to work for me. Damn, you know, heroin has done effect too for a little while. I, it takes you somewhere and if you don't put the brakes on it and shit, then your gun on that thing. I don't even know how to describe It, but I don't mind that feeling, you know, the cocaine feeling you'd like in the beginning then we're go, you don't like it and it gets worse and worse and worse, but by that time you were addicted to it. You know what I'm saying? Matt? I never understood that shit. Wanting to be up for four days that that just seems. And you will be up for two fucking days thinking you tie it, but let me go lay down and I can't sleep. I'm sweating on dose to sweat.

Speaker 1:          02:21:03       So pills I've always had. I like a little fucking sleeping pill or something, but they can't because of this sleep apnea. Yeah, they're too dangerous. Right. I can take the anxiety medication. That'll help me. Sometimes I'll pop a few. We're just stuck there like as a plan. But like one point five told them to nothing. To nobody. Point five. Do find that we'd let you go to sleep at night. Don't do deck. You ever seen me at night smoking weed because the initial effect was in the daytime. I like that morning. Hi. Why do you like that? Because that's the one that gets the whole. That's the one that lets me email text. We didn't think that the all by 9:00 or by 9:00, get It either way. Call six, put the coffee on the computer, feed the cat, pablo it, she the pablo escobar pablo.

Speaker 1:          02:22:09       Open your eyes and bed. Roll over and take a joint and smoke it. That's no brainer. You got to let your body wake up that low. Whether that's the quickest way was that fucking thing. Yeah. Let me take a hit. I love that little blunt. That fucking gino from speed. we'd the some of the best fucking jamie picked this one up. This is. This is a place down the street. what's it called? The blunt or something? I don't know. Hollywood's dedicated. Blind. Yeah. Waken up and pulling the pablo people dedicated. Yeah, it's medicine man. okay, but you wake up and give your body some chance to like. I remember smoking cigarettes in the morning. You don'T know what, what damage is to your body until you wake up in the morning. Take six steps, sit down and pull the cigarette out and whited. There is no worse damage.

Speaker 1:          02:23:13       A human being could do that. Body. Forget heroin. Forget eaten a few avocados for getting a burger. king. Whopper. Get up at six in the morning. Give yourself three minutes and by the cigarette you body does not recovered from that and you don't know how bad it is to you. Stop doing it. That damage. So I look at it the same day we reef, I let my body wake up a little bit, but at a drink water. Let the bodies heat could drink a glass of water with ice. Let my body wake up, get the stomach going, drink a little coffee and then bang out some referral. It's a different day. And you'd like to work out in the morning to write. I'm 55. I can't come to your house at 8:00 at night, but I can't. I'm not going to roll with you. Is six in the morning either.

Speaker 1:          02:24:04       Most attacks happened before. One time. Do that? Yeah. How come? I don't know. I didn't write the book and check it out. MosT heart attacks happened before fucking 12:00. So you don't want to be. I know you don't want enjoy in your site. Control at six in the morning either. I'm good at nine to kickbox tend to kickbox 11, 12. The jujitsu eyes. You got to wake everything up. That's the whole deal. Heart attacks are more common in the morning. Says fox news five to six times more likely to occur in the morning hours between one and 5:00 AM, and studies have shown that morning heart attacks tend to be more severe and those that happened later in the day too long or too short of an interval can result in abnormal heart rhythms called arrhythmias. As a matter of fact, I had stuff giving mother stabbed in the mornings. You're worried about heart attacks because that was my more. I love pushing in the wake them up. Whoa.

Speaker 1:          02:25:00       When you kick mama with that leg in the moRning, you know what I'm saying? You can be a little wife a tap in the morning. She pops her head up and then they, they already know they get up, they pee, they drIve the monkey good. They come back, they could you eat that fucking monkey and then you start giving them a stab. Him like a soldier and that stabbing dog. I wouldn't have to get up and start breathing heavy. And then I thought about that. That fucking gangster tells me to testify that time in court and he bent over to tie his shoes and he had a heart attack and the guy ended up doing a fucking jail and we had to talk about that in a second, but we will cover the heart attack. I take a baby aspirin before I go. I drink something from gnc to get me going a little bit in the mornings.

Speaker 1:          02:25:41       I still take my protein powder I live by, but I do take us up before I go to the gym and I do drink something while I'm at the gym to calm me down a little bit. What do you drink? something from gnc. Gnc. I don't know. Hm? No names, no names. performance levels. I always pop a shroom tech again, I don't pop to showroom texts. I pop one and I started with a half a capsule because it was finally my heart was beaten too much to take a year. You got to watch the ticket. That's interesting. You know, listen, god gives you a certain amount of text to your heart. I did cook that. That fucked up the whole clock. That fucked up the speedometer. You get sand in your dials. The dials I got fucked up the dominance and I got to strengthened a little bit in that strengthens it, but there's a lot of shit you could do without thinking like a marathon or something.

Speaker 1:          02:26:36       I watch my fingers numbness. I go, I get a finger up my ass as much as I could from the doctor I use. I overuse insurance dollars. Like I'm going friday for a blood test wide join because I'm in the mood. You gotta switch up every couple months. You know what I'm saying? You gotta switcH it up like Keith Richards. He's still alive because he switched it that women don't die of heart attacks. why? Because they believe every month will. He only answers that. don't take the fucking word. I'm just relaxed. You don't want to be enjoying your conversation. You're just smoking so much weed. You getting paranoid? No. I love take it down and getting deeper and deeper into the whole like what's the matter? Nothing doesn't matter at all. It's great to see you. what's going on with normal shit now I'm coming tonight. You go down there tonight.

Speaker 1:          02:27:38       Tonight. I've been taking a few days off after the netflix. Yeah. Nice. I want them to fall in love again with it. I want it to a good to take time off. It's really weird how you live and you learn and you still for dumb shit. You know the only person I should listen to him when it comes to comedy is you. And I don't see you enough that I don't talk to you enough about that. I got to get more planes with you because when I tried I watched the john and special fell in love with his joke writing and stuff. It's very funny guy. Really nice guy. Really nice guy. That's fucking great. Fucking special, you know? But every once in a wHile. I'm sorry I'm saying this word. I always think I get the white moment and I'm not a white. The reason

Speaker 3:          02:28:22       why you liked me and the people like ms dot [inaudible]. You doN't know what's going to come out of my mouth when I become a writer. That's what I'm not a comedian, normal. When I go home and start writing stupid fucking jokes and you laugh at them. I'm not joe. He is no more. That's not what joey diaz as opposed to do you know what I'm supposed to do. But this shit that's happened now scares the shit out of me. So now I gotta go up there. You pay 25 bucks to see me. I ain't got a luck thing and leaving my soul up there. I take that shit seriously now, but I'm starting to take a little bit too seriously. ThIs shit you see now in what way? That the people coming to the shows, people coming to the shows to see you. They need and they want to do you to see you do well.

Speaker 3:          02:29:03       So I go up there with this plan material that I work on heart that I believe in that bullshit because I'm a lot friendlier when I go up there and I just fucking yell and scream and go off the cuff and go crazy and my eyeballs jarden red. But no, I want to be john waYne because he makes me fucking laugh and he's what in your mind that you comic is everybody's got their own way of doing it? No, and that's what I realize. I'm going back to being a fucking lunatic. I'm going back to midnight spots next week. I'm going back to midnight spots going back to kylie, kylie, kylie, going back to cali, going back to those spots. I know they're late, but they're the only ones that keep you. If you're going to play it, if you listen for me to be in uniform, that's the only way I could do it.

Speaker 3:          02:29:48       That 10:15 following you. That ain't fun no more. We gotta be back there late like we used to go on four hours of sleep for two or three weeks and then you gotta walk me over and buy me a fucking pink that sandwich like in the old days. Why don't you like the 10, 15 spots? because they put me in that position. I'm sick of fucking been in that fucking john malaney position. I'm not john malaney. I'm going, what do you mean? But I like your dad to see me because something's going to come out of my mouth. That's going to be funny, funny coming out of my fucking mouth and listen, I love you, but you're. That's crazy. Talk you. What you do is your way of doing it. It's great at 10. It's great. At eight. You could do it. Three in the afternoon show would be amazing.

Speaker 3:          02:30:30       They stare at me at the original room. I'm going back to midnight. I'm taking the kennison spots again three nights a week because that can handle it. That means I get home at 1:32. You're going to do the late spots. Yeah. You know what I mean? The reason why I do this early shit is because I'm trying to be normal. I read that book, your podcast. Like I said, okay, now I like this. Hold on a second. So you're going to close out the store and do like an hour long set. No, no. 15, 12 slash 12 slash 15. Oh god. So you're not going to do like the don burris situation. That's what listening to joey, at least for the moment. I've just saying you got, but you can if you're closing out the show, right? You could go along. I don't want to close out the show.

Speaker 3:          02:31:17       One of the more. I don't want to be out. I'm scared of go out at night. So it's not a thought. You were saying you want to do the kinison spot? Midnight. Midnight spot when he would do that spot. Oh, I thought he was always the last guy. I thought it was the. I mean that's what they always say about brody, but he does the kinison spot and I thought it was the midnight run. Let's call it the poem on the spot. Okay. Well just you want to do a late night spot? I think they do a lot better. I don't have to go to. This will be out for sure. Yeah. Yeah. You ready for me to. It's time for me to be. I'm a fucking degenerate. I should say that fellow degenerates. Yeah. I'm to block in the morning. Nobody's saying one. Do I say one?

Speaker 3:          02:31:55       I said 12. One in the morning. 12, 12:00. You know you're getting up at one though. 12 slash realistic? No. 12, 10. You might get disturbed professionals at the store. They're pretty professional, professional. There's no more fucking people coming in and bumping you. Well, that still happens a little bit, but not too much. They don't. They don't. No one jumps on and does an hour and a half like the old days. I miss. I missed that 12:00 thought of mind. The top tWelve for me in the old days was. I swear to god joe. They've already heard everything. Yeah. If they. If I think they really want to hear these three jokes, but pocket. I got think of it and it taught me how to write really good. What do you. What has changed recently? Like the one of the things a lot of people have been saying with a especially the me too, movement, that people are more cautious about st controversial jokes now. do you feel that you feel like energy in the air being different? Do you feel like, I know you won't get mad at me. I feel the eneRgy is different, but guess what jay, but it don't apply to me.

Speaker 3:          02:33:08       It don't apply to me, doesn't apply to me, and it's never going to apply to me. Okay. I understand me shooting your special on your network. You don't want me to use certain words. This parts and I get that. This is a business. This is business as I got mouths to feed, but when I'm at the comedy store, when I'm at the improv, when I'm at the laugh factory, when I'm in flappers, when I'm at the ha, when I'm at the New York gotham, you got to let it fly. I'm old. Let it fly, let it fly. Okay. And I'm sorry. No, no, no. He. Sorry. Just so you know, you know what I put on yesterday. Would you put on. That's what I put on the studio yesterday and this is it. This is it because it's time. We're not taking it no more. I'm not taking it no more.

Speaker 3:          02:33:55       I put on an album, but again, I'm very sorry if I offend somebody. I didn't name it. He did. So take your fucking problem up with. The name of the album is bicentennial nigga by James Richard. Richard pryor. I put it on, I listened to it twice and I did it. had a ball and cried. I got fucking. I've got the, the periscope listening to richard. Okay. I got it. Yeah. Okay. And I've liStened to lenny bruce live from carnegie hall in the last couple of weeks. I don't know when the last time you listened to that because we can't because of our, uh, we guys like you and I can't. Definitely not jamie. And definitely if you're under 30 you can't because of the cost. This is how slow cultural references and how slow it is, but It's a lesson I listened to that and I'm going home gets wrong.

Speaker 3:          02:34:46       Listen to tonight what I'm staying in tonight. Listen to the one when he meets the wine on to dRacula. Oh, I think you'd see the. Is it something I said or the niggas crazy. Both of those albums. A masterpieces. and that's how he wanted us to do it. That was how we have to do it. He didn't give a fuck what the fuck was said. If a company wants to pay you hbo or cbs and joey, can we talk to him in the corner? We can't have that jump because we got a complaint about that. I'm an adult. I can't sell. You know, listened to bill hicks is dead. No, I don't feel too good myself. Okay. All right. Let's cut the fucking shit. Okay. we do this for profit. at the end of the fucking day. We're feeding our families. Right? So. But there's also a way you do it.

Speaker 3:          02:35:34       And there's also the way you do it for profit. you know, when I watched the richard pryor thing and I know he went into a hollywood bowl and they were doing the thing for gays and he went up there and win against the gays. I got it. It's something I would do. I don't know. I don't know, but it's who was supposed to be in a way as a comedian. What's supposed to be the social column of society in a way, in some way. So now you want to take that away from me. You want to take the way. I can't say I grew up on the word retarded. I grew up on the word faggot. I grew up on the word. I grew up on a lot of words that people don't accept today and I'm very sorry that you don't accept them, but it's too late for me to change my game right now.

Speaker 3:          02:36:23       Yeah, I'll try my hardest. I try my hardest. I'm still gonna. Say tranny from time to time. I know it offends, but when you're a comic. Listen man, the first seven minutes of any news is about what's going on in the world in the next 10 minutes is bad. I never talked about politics. To top it off. I'm a felon, so I need to talk about pounds. You know what I'm saying? Like, well, there's just things I'm not going to talk about. Kicking an abortion child. Remember for a long time every comic was kicking a born at freedom. That's not my style. I'm up there to talk about, you know, for the board of. Yeah, you go to comedy shows and there's always trying to be shocked at wants to be shocking. I'm not going to be shocked. I'm 15 and I'm here to tell you hoW I see it. You want to see it. This is how I see it. If I offend you, I didn't offend you to before.

Speaker 4:          02:37:16       In the beginning of the shoW, I said something very offensive until term, but in my reality was really, you won't fire crackers. You buy it from a chinese dude now then charlie, why is that racist? Because that's racist, but as a society, how is it racist, factual chinese people out of fireworks? Weird. There's weird ones that we all let fly. Like black dudes with big dicks. No one's complaining about that. Right? Do you ever hear that you assume black dude as a big deck because anybody combined? Probably They're looking to. Now that might be like maybe I'm the first one to get called out on it. That's racist. To think that black dudes have big decks. Is it is if it's positive, is it pot is like a positive attribute. Racist. Like if you said asian people are better at math, people would say that's racist. How is it racist?

Speaker 4:          02:38:02       If they're really good at something, like if they have more talent or skill or more accomplishments hasn't racist but isn't that racial if it's good, right. Like jews accepted. If you tell ari that more european jews, one nobel science prizes, he's like, of course we're smarter. Is it, is it racist to talk about how many jEws are so fucking smart? Like why is that? Why they say god damn smart. even think about how many german and european jews were like fucking serious geniuses. It's crazy trend. Like what happened over there. Callum waS trying to explain it to me once, but their values and their education and the experiences and what led to just google the numbers of european jews that have won nobel science prizes. It's kinda like it's eyeopening. You know how many Guinea from New Jersey and zero. Zero guineas from New Jersey when insights. Right. None of my relatives went in science projects in this up a couple of weeks ago. It was hard to look at. Oh, is it? Yeah. What did european jews that have won the nobel science prize? Try that. I don't know. I don't even know what these numbers. I'm talking about my ass. I know that it's. I've definitely heard it discussed that there was a giant number.

Speaker 1:          02:39:19       What are you doing over there, joe? He doesn't text me and let me know what body I need to be at.

Speaker 4:          02:39:25       Oh, 4th of July baby. This is our. Our country's birthday is a time that we should cherish. I think we should play the national anthem mayBe later. We got it. Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:39:39       But you got to play the national anthem real quick. They have on this morning by my house. I loved it. I fucking love it.

Speaker 4:          02:39:44       So how was your experience during your netflix special? Everything was good.

Speaker 1:          02:39:48       Great. Netflix. I'd take my hats off to them. Everything was great. It was my fuck up. It was my fuck up. I let it get into my head too much. I listen to too many people because I forgot the number one thing. Just be felony that shit. Be yourself. It doesn't matter how many shows did you film to? First of all, I think was a disaster. The second one, I redeemed myself a little bit. We'll put something together and we'll save something. So now I'm working really hard. I'm like, no, I'm going back to my old roots. How I want to do my stand up again. It's hard when you only have two shows. Going to shows. Is todd more bullshit? No more. No more. I Listened to. This guy has nothing to do with me. I'm a stand up comic. That's what I signed up for. What do I got left? I'm 55, but I go back to doing. Stand up another 10 years maybe. I got to stop now. You're going to shut me down now. This is where we get started

Speaker 1:          02:40:50       is where we get started. We got to. We got daughters. When do you think about. Do you think about ever stopping doing standup? Because I do. Occasionally I think about it and then I take a flight back with dice from New York and I look at dyson before I approach them. I sit down, I look at them from 10 feet away for 10 minutes and I think to myself, is this what I want to be doing at that age? And I think about what, what would we be doing? What would you really want to be a run your wife and your daughters every fucking weekend for every fucking week. You're already used to leave in one weekend at least already used to it. There's going to be a casino. SomeboDies going to pAy you once a month and leave the house with two if you would you be happy with your act if you're only going out once a month.

Speaker 1:          02:41:36       Like if you weren't going up and practice and going out once a month could be awful. But I'm saying yOu still hosting the pizza place on Wednesday nights and you still, let's pretend you move to columbus, Ohio to columbus, Ohio was so high io and you work the funny bone once a year, right? And you do your little pizza, open mic somewhere down the corner a couple of nights a week. They look at you as the older guy. They all came up looking into comedy, Watching it, you know, they listened to you. You know, when I started in economy, I started, the guy's name was george mccalvi and george mccalvi was a really special guy, joe joe, because he had been on the tonight show with, with the whatever as a comic I sustained and that's the fucking epitome for one of us. Whether he became a richard pryor or not.

Speaker 1:          02:42:29       He was on, what's his name? Come on fucking help me. I have no idea. Tonight show Johnny Carson. Carson did stand up and johnny put them on the couch, you know, to derail the Georgia mccalvi was the real deal. When george was 70, I'll never forget. He called me one night. He's like, hey, what are you doing kid? I go home to sydney. He goes, drive to Colorado springs and get onstage. Open up me. I go, I can't get on that stage because of famous manager. That was that. That's that. That club at the time [inaudible] wouldn't let you get on stage unless you took a comedy class with 35 bucks. Oh, that was a scam. Fuck, I'll waive it. So he threw me out on stage and this old guy, me that old guy had no career

Speaker 2:          02:43:12       basically. He did the local places. He owned two clubs and he worked a couple clubs at, hired him still he died on the road or whatever. My point being that he helped me a lot as an old guy. Like I looked at him and at first my first opinion of him was this whole losing. No, it wasn't a no loser. He hadn't been doing it for 30 years. He committed to this and no matter what his turnout was or whatever, he was still a comedy. He died a comic. I talked to him maybe two years until he died and I had lost contact with them. Well george carlin died on the road. You know, my greatest of all time. I don't want to die on the road. And then I know you don't want to die on the road. No, but I can't. For years I thought I wouldn't be doing this at 50.

Speaker 2:          02:43:57       Guess what? I'm 55 and I'm still doing it. This is what's important. You're still letting it swing. You're still having fun and doing a lot of crazy shit that gets you in a lot of trouble today. This is what I brought up with. We were talking about the, you know, in air quotes me to era. People are going after people today for good or for bad and to still have a wild, controversial act in this politically. Hold on one second. What are we going after? Me to people for? For me, taking him to back grabbing it. Teddy's grabbing your pusher for you. Sucking my dick for a movie role or for something like that. All those things really don't exist in my life, right? I have a wife and I have a child. The only exist them right away. If you want to come at me for sucking my dick and night in 2002, we were both doing blow be my guest, be my guest, but I want to see footage.

Speaker 2:          02:44:49       I can be. I'm sorry and take it and just. You know what I'm saying? There's a lot of people out there. They're going to get me to look at this other guy. For years he was known as a heroin addict, never got accused of sexual misconduct and some chicks that cima less than when he was 11 years old and now he's like, you need that, you need that, and the chicks on drugs. She's doing the press conference while she's on drugs. What's his name rather than one? The guy that was in heat that the neuro put them in a rehaB himself and then he married heidi fleiss for awhile. Who was with tom? That guy's been a junkie for 2000 years. All of a sudden. Why can't I remember his last sizemore size? Mom have some girl comes up when she had 26. Yeah, he molested me on a movie set when I was 11.

Speaker 2:          02:45:36       That's great and dandy dog. But you can't ruin some of these life now, but what do you think is happening? This is my question, like why are. Why are people accepting these, these situations like the chris hardwick situation or why is everybody instantly thinking that the guy's guilty? No one giving him the benefit of the doubt. No court, no justice court. There's no nothing and in some some cases, like the worst case was garrison keillor, garrison keillor's, the host of the lake, woebegone chronicles like this radio show on pbs think it is, is that what it is?

Speaker 4:          02:46:10       He apparently hugged a woman and his hand went down her back. This is, this is the depiction, and he apologized to her and he sent her an email. She said, don't Worry about it. It's no big deal. It was nothing. And then they continued, I believe, to correspond and we're friends again and then this is all this stuff start happening with al franken. And then he had this complaint brought up by this woman. She reintroduced it and said that a long time ago, he put his hand on my back and they canceled the show. They took his name off of it and they did it like really quickly and it's one of those things where you just go, okay, I really like the guy in one moment in time touches someone's back. I don't know if it was creepy or not. Let's assume it was a terrible error and it was creepy.

Speaker 4:          02:47:00       I don't think it was. I don't know. I'm not saying I know, but that's it. Just touching someone's back and you. That is a hysterical reaction. That is hysteria. That's almost the definition of hysteria. If you're not talking about evil person talking about a person who touched someone's back, like we got to be real careful with what you destroy a person's whole life with. So on the one side you have the worst case scenario, which is like a bill cosby who's drugging people and raping people. So worst case scenario for these powerful elite type people that are getting these women into their web and pretend he's another one, which they will all live on it and everybody knew about it was written into his contract. It was sexual harassment clauses were in his contract, right? It wasn't that. It was known for. Make sure we're correct.

Speaker 4:          02:47:52       We really bothers me about harvey. I'm going tell it what bothers me about harvey, what we got to die. There is a lot of people that have to be indicted and this is one of my feeling right now. This would be, this should be a rico act. This is the rico act. Agents manages oprah, eddie, because everYbody knew everybody, but here's a question. How much do they know in 2005? Everybody knew Joe Diaz was a kofi. that's a dIfferent thing though to stay. Let's pretend the same thing. Okay, but let's call Joe Davis is a coke feet. It's 2007. Joe is comes to a party house. There's two cell phones missing. Okay. Let me. Let me say this though. Do you think that it's possible that his behavior was shielded from some of the people that he interacted with, like hillary clinton or oprah or bill clinton or whoever that was, that they. Some high profile people that he interacted with. Is it possible that they didn't know? Is it possible that they just thought he was a pussy hounD or do you think they all knew he was a pussy hound and they heard little chitter chatter, but it's okay. It's okay. Would just let him show

Speaker 3:          02:49:08       me. That's number one. Number two, jamie, you ready for this? Oh jesus. Okay. I see joe, uh, whatever.

Speaker 1:          02:49:15       Not now, but Five years ago. I see joel and the first thing I had to go with joe, before you leave, don't forget I got a. What was that story would be about, about benson. Henderson is choke about a joke that somebody said the store going to place I went to and some chick took me in the back of suck my dick on the car and then she stuck a finger in my ass and that's what we talked about. So if that's what we talked about, you're going to look me in the fucking face like a man that you are in, the men that you've been around and told me harvey weinstein never turned to brad or his other bodies and listen to. Remind me to tell you the story about that dirty fucking battle

Speaker 3:          02:50:04       for sure. Okay. Then for sure. But that was after that. That's been admitted. I think they've had conversations. Oh my god. If you don't think that the wig, ben affleck and the other guy and I'm not offended. No, but I'm Just talking about boys. What boys? Right. And I have boys. What? You won't say that, jamie, you'll say to me because you're going watch blind date. No, I've never watched a movie blind date, blind crackers going off in a movie named blind date with Bruce Willis. Oh, I remember that movie. Kim bassinger, how larry's came asked me just steals the show when she walks in, the japanese lady and she was like, you know, you're entitled to 50 percent of your husband's assets in California. And the chinese woman kept saying me, no, speak english. Speak english. I was like, you don't even tell 50 percent as she opens up The door.

Speaker 3:          02:50:52       Fifty percent, 50 percent. That movie is a great word, but this is seen in the opening of that movie. Both of those aCtors are around where the guy comes up to him. He goes, you're not gonna believe what happened last night. And Bruce Willis goes, hey, we go one of these fucking sex stories Again. And he goes, so, um, that's bongos. I hope when I walk out with some lady, pulls up with a limo and I say, I've never been a little limo. She goes, we'll get in. And we were riding down sunset hard times in the summer and the next thing you know, she's sucking my dick. She's got leotards on eating, harass, and he's telling the story. And Bruce Willis, listen, when it goes, no, no, why does this always happen to you? This is some other bullshit. He goes, and he goes, ms dot. He starts whIpping out polaroids. That I've always known one of those guys in my life. of course, we've all known one guy in my life. That was the difference between that guy and what harvey. Why don't believe stuff? Yeah, I know that. But I also believe that harvey,

Speaker 1:          02:51:55       I was telling people

Speaker 3:          02:51:58       he probably was because listen, everybody was telling him. Was he telling him that he was holding people down? What do they usually tell him? What was he telling? He was raping people ass.

Speaker 1:          02:52:06       No, not at all. Do you think that he did? Well, you only want to use a piece of ass. She's a piece of ass. You've got to see her suck a dick. She'll do anything she is an animal with. That's what we do as men were braggadocio. So there was like a community of that were actors and actresses. I think he had four or five guys that knew what he was doing. I want you to remember being 27 and having floor your boys that would come back every monday with a different story to karate school. Yeah. Eight harassed. I fucked her on fire. Whatever the fuck is that yOu do. he told somebody. Somebody knew about all these stories. Some agents knew somebody because for 100 of them that said no and whatever. That had to be. Twenty five. He was playing the percentages, joe. Well, definitely. In fact, a lot of people said Yes. They blamed that one girl. They had the one girl that did rounders. They accused her. Yeah. Heard that. That played matt damon's girlfriend. She was. She went from being an extra and fucking a donnie brasco to being the guest star. Opposite fucking. Yeah. If you want to. Donnie brasco, she's what's his name? Sonny black's girlfriend, you know, made lines. She has in that movie

Speaker 1:          02:53:25       zero, zero smart move. And then a year later she's a fucking guest opposite. So there's a bunch of them that said yes to you, but do you fault the girl for doing that?

Speaker 1:          02:53:39       Have a girl decides to harvey weinstein on her own freewill and we come here with a dream and there's two ways to enhance that dream. Because I always knew that I wasn't good looking man. I always knew I was fat. Now I always knew I was already lit art. Listening to what I always knew that I was funny. So I always worked on being funny. I didn't think somebody was on let me suck their dick or eat their pussy to be a star. So that was never in my mind. But think about people who. How many people have you met with sell that? So when this town, how many people have come and gone in front of you? The reason why our friendship is still intact, it's because you know more and worker, you know, always hard worker. You respect hard work. how many times did you pull me aside and said, look at this fucking clown. You're not trying to be judgemental. You just know that he's pulling the wool over anybody's eyes. We know who's talking to talk and walking the walk. We see it on stage, we hear about it. We only twitter or facebook hear about it. We get to that club. The club owner otitis joel. Joe was here two weeks ago. He was falling asleep on stage. You know his shit. Right? So it's the same thing.

Speaker 1:          02:54:55       Yeah. No, I think so. I think, um, I think what's one of the things that stand up is good for is it's, it's an

Speaker 4:          02:55:03       exercise that you're doing while you're living your life and the better stand up gets. It's usually a better indication that you're thinking better. Like your life's more in order you more tuned in, you know, you're dealing stuff that's hitting harder because you've got better points, you know how to edit it better, and they usually that you can use that. I think it's like, remember, see, remember that moving mo. Betta blues', denzel Washington. I love that movie. One of the things I loved about that movie, I got inspired to work on my act after that movie. I was like, thinking about how much musicians practice. He was just, oh, he's practicing. And these girls, these hot girls would want to fuck. And you're like, no, not right now. I got to practice. I got to practice. I was like, damn, the discipline crazy discipline that that man has to play that trumpet and practice it over and over again.

Speaker 4:          02:55:48       And it made me really think like as a comic, we don't work like that. We don't have to rehearse all day, you know, we don't really rehearse at all. But musicians like a really good musician. I mean they're always working, they're always trying and training and working on their craft and we do it on stage in front of people. Probably more than a lot of musicians do unless they're constantly regularly touring. But it's, we don't, we don't have that kind of a work ethic attached to what we do. Like if you want to play a phenomenal trumpet, those guys, their breath control and the way they can blow those horns, man, they practice all the time. They put an hours and hours working on that. And I was thinking about it. That's a different kind of craft. It's a different kind of craft. The, the ability to play a musician musical instrument, the thing about standup that becomes a problem sometimes is that it's kind of, you can kind of pull it off like you could do it really well or you can kind of pull it off and to kind of pull it off.

Speaker 4:          02:56:42       You don't need a whole lot of effort and just need a few good subjects and a few good ways of expressing it, but to get that where you can kind of pull it off and turn it into a bit. That just smashes a bit that you put it in the. You can't wait to get to that punchline because you know it's gonna be a nuclear bomb. That's where the real work comes in and I think for a lot of us, it's the difference between how much energy you put towards anything, whether it's your standup comedy or painting or whatever the fuck you do. How much energy put towards your writing, how much energy to put towards thinking about it. The more you can do, the better it's going to be, and that's a fundamental thing that nobody ever tells you. People tell you you should write, but it's not just that you should write, you should also listen to your shit.

Speaker 4:          02:57:23       You should also perform, but the whole key to it all is just applying different kinds of focus towards your act and if you look at like a movie like mo betta blues, like he's doing, he's playing that fucking trumpet and you realize like this guy is like lost in the act of practicing this beautiful musical instrument and this is his craft and he takes pride and being excellent at his craft. He could just hang around all day and still probably blowing awesome tune at night, but no, he fucking practices and I remember thinking about that going, damn, that's probably something that's missing from the lives of most stand ups and I should probably try to think about that more with my own life. I love. I love the

Speaker 1:          02:58:02       writing and I love the performing. I hate the listening. Yeah, that's a hard part. Listen, this is very rough for me and I listened. I forced myself in before the special. I forced myself to listen a lot and it made me to fucking over critical, you know, got me to over fucking critical a week before I tape. I also went to places that I didn't put my name on the gazebo just to see how my job should do in front of regular people and that fucked with my head a little bit. A couple of little mistakes in training camp, but that's a training camp before. Don't worry you. No, I agree. It's not been doing this for 27 years. I loved doing it. I get better every fucking year. My breathing, I get something better going up on stage or confidence levels and a talk. It's 27 fucking years.

Speaker 1:          02:58:54       You're going to be doing 30 this year. Next month is going to be 30 fucking years. Did you ever see yourself doing this for 30 years? I still remember walking into the main room and mitch, he was in a booth and paul was onstage slice in that room apart and she called me over and she goes naturallY happening, no income. He 20 years and at that time I was like, damn, I've been doing comedy for 11. I still did anotHer nine and now I'm at 27. Crazy and it's like you watch people like john john, right? Who will fuck you up effortlessly without even breathing heavy. John jocko. Yeah, you'll be in. You'll get that fucking hell. You think you got them in the fucking guillotine. Next thing you know you're on your back and looking up with the army and that's what we're doing right now. I feel myself when I see a guy with a coral belt on, I'm like, that's the level now that we're at.

Speaker 1:          03:00:05       I can control a lot of shit. Joe, one of your secrets was following me. It was putting yourself in bad positions, which in jujitsu is like getting the biggest guy in the room and go, hey, you busy right now. Did I tell you on the road with me? They'd be like, what the fuck is wrong of me? And just choked me. You taking me on the road is like somebody going, hey, come here for a second. What do you wait $300? I weigh 1:40, get on top of me and amount. I put one hand and we'll start there. Let's start right there. Start right fucking there. Only if you think about it that way. See, this is what's important about it and there's one thing that's important about traveling with all really funny people. It only becomes a negative when you think at it as a negative. When someone's funny, you should be laughing and enjoying it and it

Speaker 4:          03:01:00       makes your time more enjoyable when you go on stage. Yes it does. I needed to learn that and the way I learned that, one of the ways was going on the road with you. I knew that you were going to crush and so I knew that everybody else would like to take, you know, we were both relatively young in our comedy careers back then. Right. So it was like we're talking about, I've been doing comedy maybe nine years or eight years. You were a lot wiser about the game, like you introduced me to shit, but I've never even like I read a few books, watched a few tapes, but you had the practical knowledge that I needed. Like you were the votech school. Well, what I did is I thought about it the same way I thought about martial arts. That's one of the reasons why I wanted to go on the road with your all the time.

Speaker 4:          03:01:42       I was like, you don't get better or aspiring people that suck. You get better when you spar with wizards. You gotta be real careful when you're sparring with wizards and so it was like, what I would need to do is have someone who goes on stage in front of me and just crushes and we had some. I had some Tough sets going on after you. I remember one time in rascals rascals and a west orange, right? Was in west orange or east orange, west west orange, New Jersey. Fucking great club, but you went up and you got into it with some people in the audience about something and you were just on fire just on fire. You crushed and I had a real hard time going on after you and I remember thinking, oh, okay, this is a very important lesson. Like this is important. Like there's something that I'm not doing right that he is doing right, like, what am I?

Speaker 4:          03:02:27       How come I'm not, oh, I'm nervous. I'm nervous going on after him so I'm not having fun up there. So he's having fun and I'm being tense going, oh jesus, it's better not suck, so I'm putting in my head this better not suck. It's the total wrong way to approach. Like if you approached a fight like that, man, you're going to get smashed. Most likely you want to approach a fight thinking about the things you're going to do, not the things that you want to like worry about what's going to happen if you get hit, you don't think like that. You just think about doing your thing and then adjusting along the way, and I had the wrong mindset and I needed to see someone kill a bunch of times in front of me and then bomb, go after them to realize something's wrong here, the wrong things, and I'm going onstage tense because someone was funny.

Speaker 4:          03:03:08       That's ridiculous. Like I should be the opposite. I should be happy that someone was funny because I love comedy and this is what I like to do. I mean, I like to watch it if I'm not doing it, so why am I so tense? It was just a bad way of approaching a problem and I think this is one of the things that fucks people up in life. You approach a problem the same way every time and you never stop and just completely look at the whole thing from the top down. JusT look at the whole thing. Go, what? What am I trying to do here? I'm trying to get tighter and funnier and better. What do I gotta do I gotta do a lot of sets. I got to write and I got to work with murderers. That was the key. It's like working with guys like you and all of us working together and also people knew if they came to see us like, hey, this isn't just going to be. Joe goes up and he's the hero of the show. Now you're going to get ari who's going to go on and murder your going to go on and murder and then I'm going to go up. I mean, it's a fucking

Speaker 2:          03:03:58       rock 'em sock. 'em robots show. We had. We went on the road, dude. We did cut college clubs or other across the country. We did. I mean who knows how many fucking cities. You and I and already toured on fucking crazy numbers just over and over again, bonding together, hundreds of shows together, figuring out how to fucking get everything perfect. Figure out the right amount of weed to smoke before you go on stage, the right amount of getting joey diaz riled up. You would come in yelling about something or hair or I want you to see something. I'd go into the bathroom and they'd be a shit. It looks like a crocodile trying to crawl out of the toilet bowl. All that stuff. That's some rock and roll comedy, man. You know, it helped both of us. It helped both of us a lot and it also like set a tone that I think for a lot of us, like you should be with funny people should all.

Speaker 2:          03:04:49       Everybody should try hard. Should not think that anybody doing good is bad for you. It's great. it's great for you. It's great for everybody that everybody's like doing good together is better for everybody. When I go on the road now I go onto the road and those joe rogan principles, right? That's my whole road thing. The only thing I added to the leg added to it is my travel fast. I don't fuck around. I don't want to see nobody. I'm. Yeah, go right over there. You know, there's no radio necessary. I played just like, you know, we, they'll try because they have relationships with local radio stations. They like, you know, casey ewi wants to get you in there. Cool. I go in because you want to talk to the people on the way up. The same people for sure way down. There's a lot of people that were there for me when I was in.

Speaker 2:          03:05:39       Sorry to do this station. The problem is the waking up in the morning but just killed. It just kills her and you've got to get in there a day earlier because if you want to do friday morning, you gotta get in there thursday now. You can't just show up friday, 3:00 in the afternoon. I can't do it. I fly out thursday. It fucking sucks man. That's the best you got out of me, right? Because was I got the family and I got people. We got a lot of shit. It's not like it used to be mad so. But the thing that I love about this time is that even though people are super sensitive, like we were talking about, people are real sensitive about getting in trouble for stuff. There's still rock 'em sock 'em robots, comedy going on. It's still wild up there. Like dudes are still doing crazy fucking jokes.

Speaker 2:          03:06:20       It's fun. People taking real chances that doing real stand up, you know, and there's a lot of them that's built burr. There's. You can go down the list. Ari, ari's doing real standup. You know, there's a bunch of real killers now. Santino, he's doing some dangerous stand up. You know, I'm writing for my. That's it. Like the reason, the point of that fucking story I told you, being on top of that hill at 17 and being homeless is because I had a lot of chances to ice myself. Show has a lot of chaNces to ice myself

Speaker 1:          03:06:56       that could get not a fucking prison. And thinking about getting out on bail. when I got out on bail, I had a lot of fucking doubts my friend. Thank you. Get not a bail and knowing you're going to look at 48 fucking years and you're a fucking loser as it is. Think of all those opportunities. I used to break into a friend's house to sleep in this house at night. I slept in a rocket ship for a month outside of the park. You and see those rocket ships and your kids play on them. I still remember going up to the third floor, the rocketship finishing off my coke and jerking off on the third floor at five in the morning outside in the fucking park with leaves around me and shit. So it was a lot of times I had that one. It's amazing. You have no fucking idea.

Speaker 1:          03:07:42       I would go up to the third floor with a bottle of fucking schmear silver vodka, a bag, a hooded sweatshirt, gloves with a missing finger so I could fucking touch the rock and put them in my nose and shit. You know? No, that's funny on the way up the stairs and shit. But when you're. When you come down and you're in that rocket ship, it's five in the morning. It's 22 below zero and you're thinking to yourself, fucking god took a. When my mother got did this, this is all god's fault because it's the same guy I was raised to believe that was going to help me, is doing all this. Lot of times I wanted to fucking do a swan dive, but I didn't. You know, it's so fucking weird. That was in those positions for a long time. Joe. Now I got to look at you and go, jesus christ, look at what I turned this. No, no. Tina turner'S son killed himself yesterday. It wasn't. I thought it was like son with her, you know, this trend of fucking people isin themselves. That scares me. That concerns me. Is this something where we're eating? This is something that we're getting weakened, you know, there was no drugs and bourdain system so we can't blame fucking prescription

Speaker 4:          03:08:56       drugs while he was on one medication, some sort of medication. Um, and it was something that was prescribed for them. Someone told me that it was malaria medication. I don't know, probably, I don't know if they've released that, but I'm sure he had to take some of that stuff sometimes, but you know, you don't know what it was that did him in. According to some people, he really wasn't doing well. You know, I don't, I don't know. I need to. I mean, it's almost unnecessary to get, for me to get the full story. I missed the guy. He's gone. That's it. You know what I mean? I don't need to. I think when whenever someone does something like that, whatever it is, if there's one thing that people could point to and say, hey, there's a chemical that's responsible for this, or there's a gene problems responsible for this or the like, how could someone who's loved so much want to step out? I mean that must be a terrible moment of pain to want to do it.

Speaker 1:          03:09:52       I had ever been on the computer listening

Speaker 3:          03:09:54       to music on youtube and you're right and it just keeps playing songs and you know, you don't have no control, but I think I started with lending skin skinner, a simple man kept going to the one that's going to trip and I went. I came back and at one point blow up the outside world and I'm sitting there and he says that line about going out or something. Joe rogan, my lip started shaking like, I'm like, I don't even know this guy and I miss him. This guy, you want me to look you people will tell you. I know. I met her. I met chris. I don't know. I don't know. I never, I saw him one time at the comedy store, 60 feet away from me, chris cornell, that's it. And I started crying like how could somebody like this go in a room and just iced themselves?

Speaker 3:          03:10:41       Is this what I'm going to do because I'm in this fucking entertainment field because what happens? And then I think about all these times. One time I broke into my friend's house and I broken the window and it was freezing so I couldn't even sleep in that room. I had to sleep in the hallway and there was a mattress on the wall that had like piss stains from older kids and I pulled it down and I slept on it and when I woke up he got a dog and it was too cold. He just let the dog shit downstairs and there was like 20 pieces of little rolled up shit that had been like when the juice goes out of them, they just roll up. Once those things that you use it as one of those accordion accordion, it was like a piece of shit straight.

Speaker 3:          03:11:23       It's like an accordion. What the moisture goes out of it. It really does take a shit that's this big and you put it in a box. come back a week later. It's like this big, how do I know that? Because I didn't to a guy in prison took a shit in the welfare box. One time jesus boxes of cheese with the cheese comes in american cheese. This dude had long hair and will always try to play me like he was with the biker dudes comebacks for him. But he played he where he lived in a key working in the kitchen. He forgot I ran the kitchen and there was all me and black dudes. So when dad got one of the welfare cheese boxes and I took like a 22, 24 inch, it looks like a lizard. It was just a long like, you know. Then at the end, like one of those things that like a snail brown snail mail, I fit perfectly into this cheese box and I took a flag, an american flag from the cheese and I put it on and I put it in this drawer and every night and he had the first bunk on the way out so that everybody had a walk and all the black guys were opened that door and go, god damn, it smells like shit in this motherfucker.

Speaker 3:          03:12:32       And he kept saying, I know it does. I don't want to answer it. I was like, shit in there and after like a month when they went draw, everybody kept saying, man, it smells like shit. Then he went in this drawer, opened it up, and they found this box. He opened it up and I never forget him knocking. I'm like going, I'm going to find out who did this to me, what they do to you.

Speaker 2:          03:12:53       And he goes, look at this. And like, well what is it? And I knew his shit had shrunken down from the 24 inches to six inches. Just shrunk down with all the moisture goes out. It just shrunk down like a fucking. I don't even know why I'm telling you that story. That's hilarious story. That's fucking crazy. It's a hilarious story. He's a fun times. Joey diaz. I think we're the last of the regular humans. I think we got our children's generation. Maybe one more after that and I really do believe it's over. I think we're going to integrate with fucking computers. I think we're real close to it now. Can even go whole podcast without looking on our phone. Oh, what time is it? You know, It's weird. We're going to integrate with computers. We're going to all be living in some weird world. we got this fucking virtual reality thing here.

Speaker 2:          03:13:41       Now. The htc vibe should try this thing out. It was freaking the fuck out. You think you're another place. There's a zombie games and games where you're on top of a castle defending the castle, shooting arrows down at monsters that are coming at you. We're wearing 10 to a weird world right now. Joey diaz. Computers. Too much information. Joe rogan part of these thIngs too much and from what? Listen, I'm this thing, I do not have social media. Good for You. You do know that I only have twitter on it. Oh, that's social media. I don't have facebook. I don't have nothing on social media. My hotmail. Hotmail. Oh nobody. Even people when I tell people out middle, they go, what the fuck are you talking about? So you limit your into your interaction. That's good. That's smart. And limit my interaction. I'm the road.

Speaker 2:          03:14:31       The ipad. No social media. I'm convinced we're going to flex and a writing on my ipod. That's it. What do you use for writing app? Whatever came with it. Writing whatever it section. So I have jones books, I have chapters. This died. Thoughts. So I'm working on. Is it notes? Is that what you write on? I don't know what it's because like they, it looks like yellow paper. No, no, no, no, no, no notes I have on the phone and I write on here from time to time, but nothing too follow you write it on something that's on your ipad. Yeah. So what I do is I'll write on a notebook in the mornings and then once I take the baby to whatever, I go to the coffee shop in and transfer it if I really like it to the ipad and I'll work on it from there, and then I look at the whole thing as a whole and stuff and the notebook and I don't know my spelling and I can't remember what that word was and the social media part is a big part of all this that I'm talking about and said we're just getting closer and closer to each other in some weird ways is going to be nothing compared to the next wave, whatever the next wave is, what they really do.

Speaker 2:          03:15:38       Figure out a way to integrate either virtual reality or what they're calling augmented reality. What you'll wear a pair of sunglasses and you could have google maps sitting up on it. He can google things. You could see images

Speaker 3:          03:15:50       give you navigation. It's going to get real weird. Joe. I see joe rogan. I'm still a fan of life. Me too. It bothers people and it bothers me when somebody is not a fan of life, so I don't want him around me anymore. Who's not a family life. A lot of people we forgot. We forgot. Yeah. Yeah. Too many cameras. Too many pictures, too many videos. Listen, I was raised in society. You don't see too many really talked to me to find pictures of me as a young kid. Really thought, yeah, there's not a lot of pictures taken back in society where and I came from a society will put the camera away. Right. Good. What's that? For tHe camera? Yeah. Why but put the camera. Well, we need more of that backstage, right? My way. You know we live. You know I, I'm a stern believer.

Speaker 3:          03:16:37       I don't like text messages because I'm a prick or a douche bag. I want to hit joe rogan's voice. No, we've taught some people. I don't want your fucking voice. I want to hear your voice because I know what you're thinking. If I hear you voice it, can't I care about you? I care about you too. So I want to hear your voice. I told us telling people that I love that thing that you do, like you don't want to have My one friend. The only time I ever texted you is if you text me first. Yeah, I texted you back, but I call you. We talk on the phone. You have to check in. You have to have that. You. You have to be as human. These days. I don't have nothing on my books. I don't want to do comedy, but guess what I'll do.

Speaker 3:          03:17:16       I'll push myself. I'll be sore and I pushed myself to go row because that's human contact and it's. It's, it's, it's the most positive human contact you'll ever think about your role on the street with fighting about something means knuckles and I grabbed you and pull you into cars. If I'm fucking, that's is human, so I know I'm not going to do this, but I'm not going to do that. Then to rent a lIttle bit, maybe spend some time with the girls. Maybe I'm gonna. Take the girls for dinner, but I also know that I'm gonna. Make myself have that human contact of jujitsu. You, oh, you're gay. Joe, are you just a closet fag roller with men. That's great, but I had human contact. I had an emotion. I shook hands with the guy. The guy sweat on me and I sweat on a man which builds a certain type of emotion between two men and then they'll have to be a homosexual. That's a different type of fucking man. It really is. It is. When you stop what you're doing and go jojo. Jojo. Jojo stopped after. Get the hook and while you're teaching me something, I'm sweating my fat fucking potato chips. Sweat is landing on joe rogan's neck. but you going joe, he grabbed my neck. Squeeze. Yeah, there you go. Now do that to me. Next time. You know what that does to your psyche as a man that a man that's beating you is teaching you how to get up.

Speaker 1:          03:18:48       So joe, I got in this guillotine, but stick in co and you're sweating and you're like, no, no, no. don't just put your hand in at one time. Just squeeze real tight. Good. Joey, joey, joey, you fucking killing me. Jesus. Joe, that's a complete different part of a man. I think so too. I think that that you think is good for you. No human contact. It also alleviates the tension of like men have tension that they might get into a physical altercation. You don't think that way. If you do jujitsu, great. You relaxed walking. People are scared of vitamin d. The society scared people have sunlight. You got to get on with something. A little bit of depression because depression people talk about again, you know, I many times I had to be depressed. You know how many times I've had opportunities to call you up and go, I'm depressed.

Speaker 1:          03:19:39       I get depressed for 10 fucking minutes. Right? Then I smoked the solutes and expired fucking chiba chew or I think of something that you said and I left my fucking ass off. You know, on the way up here I was high as fuck and they used to be. This guy that used to fuck with me at a body shop was a detailer. Used to fuck with me every day. Couldn't beat him up. He's a lot bigger than I would, so how to use my mind. So I saw a dead mouse one day. I took him out of his jacket pocket. He was driving to work one morning and he went in his pocket for a cigarette and he found the mouth and he crashed his car.
