Speaker 1:          00:00:02       And we're live. What's up dude? How are you? Good, Joe, how are you? Oh, very good. Good to see you. Um, for folks who don't know the story, uh, Michael as he prefers to be discussing, talk to as directed as a referred to as you, uh, you were a cop in Baltimore and you, you put a string of tweets that, uh, I read, uh, that was on Huffington Post. And, uh, that's when I got interested in this whole story because it's very rare that someone who's a cop comes out and tells about all the shit that they experience. Um, I have friends that are cops. Um, and I know there's a lot of good cops out there, just like there's good everything, you know, there's, you know, a Sam Harris and I'm Dan Carlin just did a podcast recently together. It's a really excellent podcasts. And one of the things they were talking about, we were talking about people in power, people that were our politicians, that they, those are the whole spectrum. You get great people, people that are genuinely trying to do good and you also get psychopaths. Um, it seems like you ran into a lot of fucking psychopaths. How long were you a comp for? I was a cop for 11 years. But you look like you're 20. Thanks. How's that possible? I don't know. Good genetics, good genetics. And I guess she did this trust didn't fuck with you.

Speaker 2:          00:01:25       It didn't really, really honest. How did it not, my idea of, of, uh, what an officer should be was to be more robocop ish. Like where I took my emotions out of the job and handled it strictly as enforcing the law. So if I was spit on, I realized they weren't spitting at me, they were spending at the uniform. It was just irrelevant. I understood it wasn't personal, so I separate it. That as like a, a, a role maybe like I was acting.

Speaker 1:          00:01:53       That's a great attitude to have, I guess. Um, uh, was it, does that something that you thought about before you became a cop or is it something you cultivated while you were a cop?

Speaker 2:          00:02:03       I can't say for sure, but it seems like, I actually think that was a wrong way to think. But if you analyze it and you're at that time, you think, well, how am I not going to be biased? I'm not going to be biased by, by separating myself from the situation and kind of acting as autonomous. Right. But I think that that also made me blind because if I was being blind to racism than I was being blind to when we were doing it, even if I wasn't doing it, I wasn't seeing it when it occurred either because I was really literally blinding myself to it.

Speaker 1:          00:02:35       So you're saying that if you were blind to racism against you, then you were also blind to cops that were committing racism.

Speaker 2:          00:02:42       So if I looked at it as whether my, whether I was talking to somebody of Latino descent of black or whatever, male, female, I looked at them just as equally regardless. So if you do that, then you don't see that you're disproportionately enforcing things against somebody because I'm literally not trying to see that. Hmm.

Speaker 1:          00:03:06       So That's interesting. So by, by trying to treat everyone as equal, you weren't taking a count of how many black people you were dealing with. How many Latinos you were dealing with, how many people of color, how many minorities is that fair assessment? Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:03:22       it is fair to the extent that, I'll admit that I, when I was in, uh, in the eastern district, I would intentionally lock white people up so that I could make sure my, my numbers weren't like, like my squad. It wasn't like, oh my gosh, look, they look up 95% African Americans. I didn't want to see that. I wanted to see some kind of ballot. So I was like aware that, hey, we're locking too many black people up, but I don't think I, it, it just didn't compute at the time. It takes time for it to settle in.

Speaker 1:          00:03:49       So what about those poor white people that you locked up on purpose? I've got nothing to do with a guilty at least. Yeah. Yeah, of course. I never locked the pay by, wasn't guilty. Well, that's good. But you, you experienced a lot of shit. I mean, some of the things that I read, um, that uh, okay, here's one punting, a handcuffed face down, suspect in the face after a foot chase. I'm pissing and shitting inside suspects homes during raids on their beds and close jacking up and illegally searching thousands of people with no legal justification.

Speaker 2:          00:04:24       This is crazy, man. This is crazy stuff. Well, when, when you're doing it, it's just what police do you know it, you've seen it on TV, you've seen it driving by. You've seen a corner full of black guys with the cops searching them. You've seen him. And when they're going into those pockets, you can't go into his pocket. You simply can't. But we do. And not allowed to. Right? You have no way of doing it unless you're, you're getting a, a frisk where you have, you can justify Plainfield doctoring and then you can get into the pocket. But that's extremely rare. I mean that, that's a specific set of circumstances under a Terry stop. And that's nothing that you see Harry stop. So Terry versus Ohio was a case law that established, I could be slightly off on the particulars, but if somebody was displaying the characteristics of an armed person and you had suspicion or a hunch that criminal activity was afoot, you could stop that person. And conduct a frisker the outer garments. So how to garments, right? So just the pat down essentially. So the outer garments being a jacket right at jacket. So if you had, if, if like you thought there they had a weapon on their hip, you could pull back the jacket and kind of pat it down. But it seems as the law is written, it would have to, you'd have to even like squish it and it's just what you can touch from the outside.

Speaker 1:          00:05:35       So if you padded the outside of the jacket and felt a gun that was in his waist, then you could, you could arrest him or take that gun, right? You're perfectly fine, but you can't dig in his pockets and look for crack.

Speaker 2:          00:05:47       Right? Well you can if you have what that's playing field doctrine. So if through my expertise I can tell that that is packaging that is consistent with, that are distributed

Speaker 3:          00:05:58       in the area and I can justify that, then I can go and retrieve those narcotics that that's an extremely, I mean if you can just think about that. How do I really know that that bag in your pocket is marijuana, not Oregano. It's, it's I, I don't, I'm not sure if that should be legally justified or not.

Speaker 4:          00:06:14       So that stop and Frisk Shit that they were doing in New York, they're not doing that anymore, right? Isn't that the deal? We talked about that on a podcast once we, we went over all the times that it was just innocent people and it's fucking staggering. It's disgusting. That stopped. They would just be able to pull white, I mean, black kids. I said, why kids? Not really though. Right. It was mostly black kids. They would just be able to pull them over and go, hey, let me, let me check you, and they would just check their bodies and most of the time they were innocent. Most of the time there was nothing to check for.

Speaker 3:          00:06:45       I'm going to tell you that 99.99999% of them have nothing on them because they're not even usually documented. So in Baltimore will do stop and Frisk, stop and Frisk. You have to conduct an entire specific report called a stop and Frisk report that justifies everything you did and, and so it's a big pain. So no one's going to write that. So they just do it and they move on. So your stance or any style you see as junk, so, and the stats that you see that are junk, sit there and say one in a thousand actually have something on them. So think about what reality is

Speaker 4:          00:07:17       Jesus. Um, what, what led to you leaving the police force and was this a buildup? W was it something that you thought about for a long time?

Speaker 3:          00:07:28       Hey, ready? Laugh. Yes. Okay. We had a shooting range in the basement of the eastern district. We had to move something. Uh, we had to put one desk on top of another desk. It's slipped and I tore my shoulder out. There's your exciting story for why I left. That's it. That's it. What, what was the injury? I had my shorter reconstruct. It just tore at Tor. I, it's where everything out and had to put it back together. I'm like, what? What? No Mountain. So the rotator cuff, not rotator cuff. And so the, the uh, cartilage that folds over just doesn't hold it into place anymore so it can come out easily. So if it can come out easily, they don't let you be a cop anymore and they process it can come out easily right now. Yeah. So it's permanent forever department and it's fucked up from moving a desk?

Speaker 3:          00:08:13       Yes. All the paradigms. The story. I've got nothing. I have nothing. Um, so you left and then you decide how long ago was this? I got injured in like late 2009 but it took time to do the surgery. He's trying to come back. I mean I tried to come back. I came back and I was going code it to a call with lights and sirens. Went to turn down a street and the shoulder popped out. So I went up onto the sidewalk is I had to grab it with the other hand and that's when I had to go back in and then they said I need another surgery is not doing another surgery. So from a fucking turn. Wow. Fuck Cain Velasquez,

Speaker 4:          00:08:52       surgeon fixed that dude up. Pretty good I guess. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:08:56       so you decided once you were out, once you knew you were out, you'd done the surgery, you, you couldn't be a police officer anymore cause you shoulder blows out. What made you decide to go public with all this stuff?

Speaker 2:          00:09:07       Well I've actually talked about this for a long time. Um, when I have, we had a lot of local media and a local street reporters and stuff like that that I was friends with on Twitter and we would talk about these things for the last couple of years. We would just go back and forth talking about things. And I had no idea that anybody would pick up on this. I thought I was just going to be talking to the same reporters in the same local group of people that I've been talking to the whole time. So I came back and saw that somebody started paying attention.

Speaker 1:          00:09:33       And what was that like for you? Shocking. Yeah, we were talking about it before the show started. This new found notoriety. How weird it is. Like describe it.

Speaker 2:          00:09:44       Uh, when we landed in La, guy asked if I was on TV talking about police and it's like, I don't know, I'm used to being anonymous. So I'm used to just going in, minding my own business and not bothering anybody. And then suddenly people know who you are. It's, it's, it's, it's awkward. And especially for what they know you are, because every time now a cop looks at me, I'm like, yeah, it's, it's going to, I'm the bad guy now, so I can't trust them as well. It makes it kind of a, I'm kind of stuck in a, in a weird place.

Speaker 1:          00:10:14       So when this most recent Baltimore, uh, incident took place, the Freddie gray incident, the eruption of public attention on police brutality in Baltimore and the marches and all the new stories, then people start really paying attention to you. Is that fair to,

Speaker 2:          00:10:34       yeah. I mean, it seems like that was the case. I maybe somebody had followed me before and somebody with a powerful retweet. I have no idea.

Speaker 1:          00:10:41       And so what was the, explain how it all went down. Like how did you become this

Speaker 2:          00:10:46       public figure? I mean, I literally have no comprehension of what happened. I decided that I was just going to talk about some of the things we do so that it's like, look, this is what we do. Let's not try to pretend that we don't do it. We do it. So it's not about whether we're going to blame the cops that did it or whether we're going to go back and have retribution. We need to realize that this is what we do. Stop denying it. The black community has been lying for the last 50 years. We need to fix it and in a realistic scientific way and where we have some empathy and treat people like human beings because we don't,

Speaker 1:          00:11:21       what is Baltimore like to someone whom I, my buddy, my buddy John Rollo lives in Baltimore. Shout out to John Rollo. Um, he loves to the podcasts all the time. And the way he describes it is, I mean I've been there a few times for the UFC, but uh, I haven't, you know, gone into the bad neighborhoods. I didn't wash the wire. So, but watching this, this whole incident and seeing these people talk about how many times they've been arrested and how many times they've been fucked over by cops and how crazy it is there and how much crime there was there

Speaker 3:          00:11:54       and how much violence there is there. Um, what it's like trying to grow up there and become a normal person and what a fucking uphill struggle that is described Baltimore to somebody like me. Okay. So Baltimore, like anywhere else is largely good, but it has a microcosm of it. It's like the prototype for the prison cycle. So somebody comes up in a neighborhood and they just have no hope and they keep feeding that school to prison cycle over and over and over again and has a deep history in Baltimore. So it invades everything. So whether you're talking about are the things that police do or whether you're talking about where they live in Baltimore, the, you have clusters, so you'll have a, a black neighborhood here, a black neighborhood here, black neighbor here, white money, white money, white money, low income white, and it's in these clusters.

Speaker 3:          00:12:42       But these clusters were intentionally formed by the law, uh, in Baltimore. I can't even say how long ago, maybe a hundred years ago. And you still have deeds now that say you can't sell the house to an African American person. So like even if you were a doctor there, you couldn't, if you were a black doctor, you couldn't buy a house in Nice white neighborhood six years ago. So you had to still go buy a house in that little area and that if you're, if you're a clustering, everybody like that, it just pulls everybody down constantly. Constantly, constantly. It's like, it's, they're just constantly beat down. There's just no way out. So 60 years ago, 60 years ago, you couldn't buy a house if you were a black guy in certain neighborhoods. And it was a law. They had this on that it wasn't a deeds. There's still some of the deed still have it still.

Speaker 3:          00:13:25       Why? They know court's gonna uphold it, but you'll still see it. You'll see it in there. So you'll see the language. So if there's a white neighborhood today, there's, there's a possibility that some black person who wants to move into this white neighborhood might encounter some resistance because of this. I don't know if they're going to count a resistance, but they're going to see it in the deed that's going to make you feel awkward. Fuck. Why is it still in their cases, the original deed? They keep carrying it over. Know why wouldn't they change that? I don't know. I don't, I have no idea why this city is that way, why these people did these things. It doesn't make sense. Nobody stood up objectively and we created these racist institutions. I mean, they are institutional racism. There's no doubt about it. And it's up and down in these urban environments and these cities, Cleveland, Ferguson, Baltimore, Atlanta, it's irrelevant.

Speaker 3:          00:14:12       They're all the same. All these urban environment and there's all over Compton, watts. And go would, there's a ton of places like that in La as well. It's all over the world. I mean all over the United States I should say. There's neighborhoods like that that seem almost inescapable. Digitas and the Malmo on radio lab. Yes, I did. Okay. You know how long back that gives me think. I mean this is so we're denying that we have this so, so well people are saying these cops aren't racist. Not saying they are racist when I'm telling you is they're participating in institutionalized racism. Just like everybody in Britain was doing back in Kenya with the mouse however long ago that was. That was a long time ago. And you're, you're seeing it come out how it's just the whole

Speaker 2:          00:14:52       thing. If you're participating in it, you're guilty. And that's what I'm telling you. I'm guilty. I participated in it. It is there a way to fix it? Well, the easy thing from the police thing is I think empathy is number one. We had to start treating human beings like they're human beings. We have to like we just arrest them and you throw him in a cage just like they did with Freddie Gray and you don't focus on them being somebody's child or, or, or, or your, I mean, race is a social construct. This is my brother and I'm doing this to him. Eventually just doesn't, it's inconceivable.

Speaker 1:          00:15:30       Um, uh, W we've had this conversation a hundred times in this podcast where I have always wondered why is it that we put so much emphasis in trying to repair damage that we've done in other countries. So much emphasis in nation building, so much emphasis in invading places because of whatever perceived threat or whatever natural resource we want to dominate and monopolize. But no emphasis whatsoever in fixing our own inner cities. No emphasis whatsoever and fixing the ghettos and just constructing social center is giving people places that are safe to go to and somehow or another educating people and, and, and, and lifting them out one by one out of the fucking constant cycle that they're in this never ending cycle of poverty and crime and being surrounded by it. Man, you, everyone knows that people imitate their atmosphere. It's just a part of being a human being.

Speaker 1:          00:16:28       That's why accents exists. That's why people in some parts of the world do weird things because everyone around them does it. Like, you know, weird clothes that they wear a weird rituals, scarring of their face. You know, what have you, that we imitate what's around us. And when you're around a lot of fucking crime and you grow up around a lot of fucking crime and a lot of people with records, criminal records, and it becomes normal. And I don't know how to fix that and I don't, I don't see any effort whatsoever in really engineering some sort of a solution to what these poor, unfortunate people are born into.

Speaker 2:          00:17:07       Well, for police it's even worse because we're perpetuating that situation. So work, we're the ones doing that cycle. So when we see a 61 time I was a shift commander in the eastern district and I'm telling my guys, stop pulling over old white ladies. Stop pulling over that young cute girl. Stop. We focus on who committed the crimes and who commit the crimes. In Baltimore, 16 to 24 year old black males. That's who's committing the crimes. So focus on them. That makes sense. Until you complete the cycle and realize that you started doing that because of institutionalized racism in your organization. And so when you are jacking up those guys in the corner and you do find that dime bag, so sent him to jail, now he can't go to work the next day. So he loses his job and then he can't make it to court.

Speaker 2:          00:17:54       So he gets his license suspended and then he's driving and then you are focusing on those 1624 black male. So now you're more likely to pull them over. Now you pull him over. Now he has a suspended license. Now he gets his license is revoked and now he can't get to the job legally and you just, and now, now he's dealt. It's left with selling drugs on the corner. So you were were creating it. We have to step back and realize what the facts are and what we're doing. And then the number one problem is the drug war. And then we have money in politics. Those are our two big issues that we have to solve before we get anywhere. Well, what does the money in politics has a player. So I don't think we can change anything until we stopped having politicians that are serving their donors versus serving the people.

Speaker 2:          00:18:39       So somebody that's talking like me is never going to run a police agency as long as all their corporate donors are saying, no, no, no. You keep those animals and the cages because that's what they do. I mean, that's a good joke in Baltimore that police are actually the zookeepers. She keeps everything in it. Don't let it hit the county. So, so that's, that's our role. That's what we're doing. So your mayors and your politicians are going to continue to encourage that. They're not going to take a risk and say, all right, how do we lower juvenile possession of marijuana? You know that I know you do. You know you legalize it. Yeah. And you control it. And rates actually go down. Whether we're overseas or were in Colorado, your possession rates for marijuana will go down among juveniles. But we don't do that. We keep looking at everything like we're hammer searching for nouns and we keep looking for what we're going to hit to stop it. Instead of standing back and using science and figuring out what are we actually going to do to fix this problem, what we'll actually have results. This is a very rare to hear a cop talk like this. I'm, I'm really happy that you're coming forward and speaking like this, but how many people that were with you in the police force or upset about this?

Speaker 2:          00:19:49       My closest friends, I think understanding. I think the vast majority is upset with me and they're going to be upset with me because what I'm really trying to do is take power away from them. I mean, I really am. I'm trying to take power from them and give it back to the people because we're supposed to be serving them. We're not supposed to be this occupying force and this pretty little white boy from the county looks like an occupying force in the city. There's no way around it, so I have to be aware of that and think about that. Think about what I'm doing. Not being an occupying force, essentially actually go out of my way to lift up a situation to deescalate it and do better than the, come in there and be like, you're going to jail, you're going to jail. Shut up, let's go.

Speaker 2:          00:20:25       Which is what I did for a long time. So when you say the county, what does that mean? When you say white boy from the county. What's the county? So the suburbs, so in Baltimore it's kind of weird. It's a little different. So Baltimore's incorporate it. So has nothing to do with the county. So there's like this hard line. So it's not lawyer and then the county of Baltimore County. Oh, okay. Right. So you have the city by itself. So here in Los Angeles, do you think you have marina Delray, you have Inglewood. You have all this stuff. Is Is La in Baltimore? It's just Baltimore. So everything is concentrated and focused. And me coming from the county, I've never spent any time in the city growing up. I come in just as straight from the Marine Corps that's ready to roll. We're going to do our thing. Uh, I'm going to put on a different uniform and continue my war.

Speaker 1:          00:21:14       Wow. So that was, that was why he became a cop. So you came right from the military and it just seemed like a logical progression.

Speaker 2:          00:21:22       It's a logical progression. I think I went into the Marine Corps to prepare myself. I was a little, uh, uncontrolled and decided to go into the Marine Corps to get my shit together and discipline mass if I could get into the police department and everything would be, and that was my always my goal.

Speaker 1:          00:21:36       So your goal was always to be a police officer, right. Why was that?

Speaker 2:          00:21:39       I Dunno. Said it since I was a little kid. Uh, I think you go in with these grandiose ideas that you're going to help people and, and maybe that's why I talk. I mean, it's still evolving then I, then I'm saying these things, so you're, you're bringing up a point and maybe that's why I taught. Maybe I feel that I wasn't doing what I actually set out to do. I was actually exacerbating the situation.

Speaker 1:          00:22:00       So you got caught up in the cycle yourself. The cycle of law enforcement and the way law enforcement behaves in Baltimore and it just became habitual.

Speaker 2:          00:22:09       Totally. You don't think about it, you just ignore it. So when I say that, uh, I had that suspect that I chased and the guy comes up and kicks him in the face. I think to myself, God, that guy is a fucking asshole, but not me. I didn't do it right. But I have the responsibility to do something there. That was an assault on an innocent victim. It's not as bad as McKinney, but it's assault on an innocent victim that I should have certainly stepped up and done something about it. It's just, you were, you were in it. You don't it, I can't explain it how you don't see it until you've really just start to slowly step back and say, what are we doing here?

Speaker 1:          00:22:51       We're starting to see more and more, um, videotapes s police stories of, of police brutality. Do you think this is just a result of cell phones or is the violence escalating or is the violence always been there like this, but people are finally finding out about it?

Speaker 2:          00:23:11       I think it's actually deescalating the violence. Yeah, I think you're, I think your cell phones are certainly scaring a lot of cops from, from doing things. But the only variable here is the proliferation of videos, a video cameras. So as you get more and more cameras, you're seeing more and more. But imagine what it was like before the camera's cops know the cameras are there. We've known it for a long time. So like we have pole cameras in Baltimore and so if we were going to do something on, so there's a street called monument street that's full of these cameras that are monitored by the city. So as an officer, I always knew

Speaker 3:          00:23:46       that if I was on that street, I kind of had to behave in a, in a different manner because I knew the camera was there. Now we know that the camera's there all the time, so it's, it's gotta be much smaller. Well, there's always these guys, they say that you can't even believe they're real humans. Like that fucking cop and Texas. It showed up at the pool party and did the fucking role. Like he's Paul Blart Mall Cop. Holy fucking shit. When you find out that that's a real person, you just like, wait. So, so think about that situation. So that's the McKinney situation where you have a guy assaulting a 14 year old girl and that chief still comes out and still he has that blinder, that blue blinder where he's saying there's 11 good cops there. My ass, there are, there are 12 bad cops there.

Speaker 3:          00:24:27       Cause he just witnessed an assault on a 14 year old girl in a bathing suit and did shit about it. So you have 12 bad cops. But the reason why I'm talking is because I do think there's 11 other ones can be spoken to. I think the guy that comes up and pats him on the back then it was like, Yo, what are you doing? Why is your gun out? If we keep talking to him then maybe he'll be able to go talk to two more people maybe who realized what he's doing. And we can kind of, at least on a grass roots level kind of changed what police think they're supposed to be versus what we are. We've talked about it on the podcast many times that I think that it's one of the most difficult jobs that a person can do. And one of the jobs that has the least amount of respect cops like almost routinely are treated with disrespect and also they're there.

Speaker 3:          00:25:17       No one, no one thinks about PTSD for cops. People think about it all the time when it comes to soldiers is become much more in the public eye. But the amount of stress that's, that's a part of being a police officer. What does that, like when you're going into these bad neighborhoods and you're dealing with murder, when you're dealing with all sorts of different assaults and domestic violence and theft and robbery, like what is that like to be a person who deals with that every day and how much of a factor does that play in these people snapping on people?

Speaker 3:          00:25:52       This is hard for me to say because I don't feel like I had that. Um, I did not find the job stressful on the streets. Uh, the greatest enemy was from within. Uh, they say that and then to watch, don't worry about street. You got to worry about what the other officers are doing. I missed that too. I thought it was good. Yeah, that was good. It was a, the, the banter back and forth and then movie is very realistic of what cops act like. You think cops are all professional, but we're sitting in the car talking about the same things and anybody else talks about and then you're, oh shit, something's going on mostly pussy, right? Yeah. Anyway, so where were we? We were talking about how stressful it is. Right? It's not, it wasn't stressful for me. Are you a Weirdo? I don't think so.

Speaker 3:          00:26:34       I think I built up that wall and to do other people have that wall. Not all of them. I knew some of them handled things, uh, more personally. So they take, I don't think we want those people as cops. I understand it's hard for them. I get that. But the job's not for anybody. You're absolutely right. When you say the job is nearly impossible. I think it, it is impossible to do. Right? So that's why we have to be more human so that when we screw up, we can say, look, I screwed up and this is why. And people will understand where you're coming from. Whereas with Freddie Gray, we obviously screwed up. There's no way around this, but yet we still come out and be like, oh, but we don't know anything. We're to, the facts are out bullshit. You had somebody in your possession and he's dead, stopped denying it.

Speaker 3:          00:27:16       No. What was all the bullshit about him having a neck injury that turned out to not be true? Right. That's how it was all bullshit. Was it just something somebody made up online? Is that what you would think? He had an old car accident or something like that and the case had some kind of final disposition that was entered into the court records, but it was that, it was harking back to something a long time ago. So he died from being slammed up against the wall inside the back of a paddy wagon. Right. So that's what happened. And what was he arrested for? Okay, so let's think about, let's put this in real terms. Okay. Police always want to put things in legal terms, but you're in a high drug area. Uh, lieutenant sees Freddie Gray, well allegedly sees Freddie gray recognize him, turn and run.

Speaker 3:          00:28:00       So they chase, they follow him, they catch him, they searched him. And do we have a stop and Frisk? No, they didn't document a stop and Frisk. So because he's running, does that mean that he, there's these suspicious. So believe it or not, the law says that that's fine, that you can chase him and you can stop him. So my immediate objection with that case, I don't know why I can't think of it off top of my head, but that case, there's no clarification on how much force is allowed to be used. So in a stop and Frisk, you can actually use a, a legitimate amount of force. But in that situation, the running, I don't, I don't really know how much force is allowed to be used there. So I was curious how much force they use. But apparently they didn't use that much force and they searched him and they got a knife out of his pocket.

Speaker 3:          00:28:46       So let's stop at this knife. Now how do we get into the knife? We searched it went into his pocket. We don't have, we don't have a stop and Frisk. Right? But even if you can somehow justify that the knife that he has, his only illegal if it has an internal spring. So how could you feel whether it had an eternal spring or not and how many white people do you think carry a knife on the internal spring? It's going to be the same amount. But do any of them ever get arrested? Never. The internal spring. So fucking stupid. They have thumb releases for knives now that are easier than a switch blade. The whole thing is stupid. So why do you create a law like that? You create a law like that because you can fuck with the people that you want to fuck with. That's why we do it because they saw west side story and something like that. Switch plates back and then now everybody's scared to switch late in high school. I thought it was a bad ass, but then I realized like it's just a knife, a regular knife. It's like a better tool. Like that switch plates, fucking stupid spring

Speaker 4:          00:29:42       breaks, it folds up. So this guy had a switchblade, is that,

Speaker 2:          00:29:47       well, well we haven't seen the knife yet, but by we have, they don't even mean a switchblade with they're saying is, so you have an assistant so you have a flip out. You know how some of them you have to use your whole force, right? And so some of them are assistant and assistant pocket knife. It's this big, it was illegal in Baltimore. But I assure you that everybody that's been arrested with that is 98% going to be black. So the users and excuse absolutely. So we can fuck with who we want to fuck with. It's exactly what we did.

Speaker 4:          00:30:16       So his knife was essentially like a utility knife that people might have in that

Speaker 2:          00:30:20       if you live in a hood [inaudible] probably you might have an iPhone yet. Probably a good idea. Yeah. So if I would've called him, well I would probably chased him because I think he was dealing, I would have chased him. Right. But I would have stopped him. He didn't have the drugs on him. He wins. I searched him. I probably do take out the knife, but I give it back to him and I say, okay, be safe. Sorry about that. And we're good. We're playing the game. We know.

Speaker 4:          00:30:40       Did it bug you that you were looking for drugs? Did that ever like go, what the fuck am I doing? Being some sort of a glorified revenue collector for the state, pulling people over and g for drugs.

Speaker 2:          00:30:54       Yeah, you're totally right. There is no point in any consensual daughter grievance to fight against them. But, but my whole point is to keep it real. It was fucking fun. It was fun. It was fucking great fun to catch him. I live for the car chase. I mean, you think about this, think about if you're in a police car and you have the lights and sirens and you're going down like coastal highway, or you're going down your favorite one oh one or whatever it is, and you're gone through your side roads and you're chasing this guy. There is no adrenaline rush. It's ever compared to that. It you live for it. It's, it's incredible. It's amazing. And you don't really, I, I didn't really care why gimme the car chase. It was, it was amazing.

Speaker 4:          00:31:36       That's so refreshing. The honest. I'm so glad you're talking like this because I always thought that too. I was felt like they, it must be exciting for them. Like a fucking is amazing. Cheetah chasing the gazelle.

Speaker 2:          00:31:46       Right? Well, it's a three good stories we could tell later on that. I mean, it's just like, oh, you can understand if you're in that situation.

Speaker 4:          00:31:51       Is that one of the reasons why so many cops shoot people? It's like the idea of the rush of being in a gun fight of the rush of finding someone who deserves to get shot. You know it's like when you're hunting, all right, you're, you know you see animals that you're not supposed to shoot but I swear to God there's a party. Fucking Brandon wants to shoot a squirrel. It was like a 300 win mag. You don't do it but there's a part of your brain you like, you have a rifle. He looked into the crosshairs squirl doesn't even know you're there. You don't do it. But there's a part of you that wants to and I'm like why does that even exist? Because people like hitting targets. The same reason why you like going to the range and shooting at those steel targets. Like why do you like, because people like hitting things with guns cause you have a gun. Like you said when you have a hammer everything looks like a nail and when you were in your cop car and someone takes off whether or not it makes sense to chase him, it must feel like the right thing to do. Right? Like your instinct,

Speaker 2:          00:32:50       I'm going to go with you on the car chase. I'm not going to go with you on the shooting for like was I looking for the target? Yeah, I was, you know, if I had a guy with a knife, I was sitting there, I was telling him, put it down, put it down, but in my head I'm of fuck, don't put it down. You want them to come out, shoot him fucking cop. I'm going out there. You know? It's like this is what you do, but, but you had a line for I, yeah, and I go to across it. I certainly was going across, I was ready to shoot if I had to, but I was never going to cross that line. You kind of wanted to shoot. Sure. Wow. I killed it. I come from the Marine Corps. I was in fast team. Right. This is what I did.

Speaker 2:          00:33:28       I was trained from 17 I went to marine court 17 I was handed a rifle in bootcamp and I went into special ops and I was trained day in and day out to kill. That's, that's the honest truth. And then I have to transition into bringing those skills, that skill set into a police department where luckily I was able to separate myself and it wasn't an issue for me, but I don't think that's where the shooting has come from. I'm pretty convinced that your military members actually won't shoot. I'm convinced that the shooting come from fear.

Speaker 4:          00:33:57       Uh, that makes a lot of sense. So the military members have more discipline, they've been through real war and they understand shooting and death better. Yeah. I think you just understand the rules of engagement better. Whereas the people that come from civilian life, and you know, there's a fucking video of this guy who's this big fat slob who's a cop and a, he's trying to get ahold of this guy and the guy winds up beating his ass and there's like this chaos thing running around. But I'm looking at that guy and I'm like, this guy does not, there's no way this guy should be a fucking law enforcement officer. He's just way to add a shape. He's just way too undisciplined. You know, his, his body is just not serving him correctly. And he's involved in physical altercations with criminals and to be a person that is in day to day contact with people that may or may not want to kill you, you're like, you have to have a certain amount of awareness and you have to have a certain amount of physical ability.

Speaker 2:          00:34:58       Yeah. And you have to trust those abilities. You have to realize that you're going to be able to handle that situation. I think it's easier in a city then it would be for Pennsylvania state trooper or something like, I don't know what I would do in thirst shoes. And they're stuck out in the middle of nowhere by themselves in a city, all you gotta do is hold on for 30 seconds, you're going to get help. But how they do it in those environments, baffling to me, but they don't get into a lot of shootings as much as urban environments because I think it's that fear. But I think as a nation we fear the black man. He's the demon. So you saw that and Mike Brown, when that cop says, oh, he had a demons look in his eye and the team is looking at it.

Speaker 2:          00:35:33       I, what are you talking about? Do you ever see anybody say that Dylan roof? Oh, he looked like he had a demon. Look in his eye. They don't say that. They say, oh this troubled youth, but the black guys, the demon. So we have that in our society that that's the criminal. So that's who we're looking at and that's who we're fearing. We're fearing the black men raping. Our daughters were fearing that, that whether we want to face it or not, as a nation, it's real and we have to face it. If we want to learn how to police properly and we actually want to get our nation back to where it is and we stopped and we tear down these borders, these things that we do, these social constructs, your flags, you're your, whether we have a line now in Mexico so that they can't come over here and we don't help them. And, and we have our states and we do all this other. All so much dumb shit that we just make up the separate ourselves, but there's no difference. He's, he's got more Melatonin than I do. Wonderful. Whatever. They're just human beings. We're all the same. We know that scientifically. We know this. I agree with you on that. But there,

Speaker 4:          00:36:25       the guy that shot the people in Colorado, that was one of the first things I said, does it, is he looked possessed. The, the, his eyes were, I mean, I absolutely agree with you that there is institutionalized racism. Absolutely agree with you. But I think anytime someone becomes a school shooter or, I mean they, they treat that person like there are some psychopathic maniac.

Speaker 2:          00:36:44       Yeah, I can see that. Did you get into altercations where you had to shoot people? I could have pulled the trigger justifiably, quite a few times, but he never did. No, no. 11 years in Baltimore in the city. And he didn't have to shoot anybody. No, no, no. I can't. I mean, I know of two that were pretty happy. I'm pretty close to me and that were completely, completely clean shootings. And again, it was an, it was an experiene. Maybe I'm being biased. I don't know, but,

Speaker 4:          00:37:10       well, it makes sense to me. I don't think you're being biased at all. I would want someone who, first of all, it's a logical progression. If someone is looking for a good job and they get out of the military, it's a logical progression. I would trust military members more than I would trust the civilian has never seen any, any real gunfire or any, any real shit. You know, someone who has never experienced any sort of altercation like that and all of a sudden being thrust into it, you just got to hope they can keep it together. I know some people can, but a lot of people can't. Someone who's been through the marine, someone who's been through, you know, anything, a navy seal, someone who's been through war, that person in my eyes is a much more qualified candidate than the average person. It makes sense. So when you're talking to me and you're saying that you had a certain amount of discipline and you had a sir, but you're also being very honest about you wanted them to come at you, which I think is a natural human instinct. I think it's very important that you're talking like this. I really do. Cause I think, um, there's a lot of people that would shy away from talking like that, especially someone who's still out of a career in law enforcement. You know,

Speaker 2:          00:38:17       I think my, my hopes for resuming a career in the US first, we are probably over. Yeah. And less

Speaker 4:          00:38:23       when it comes along and listens to this with an open mind and realize is know this fucking guy is exactly what we need. And I think that is exactly what we need. We need people like you and we need people like you, other people

Speaker 3:          00:38:36       are going to listen to and say, well, here's a guy who was on our side. Here's a guy who's not a racist. Here's a guy who's not just looking to shoot people and lock people up. Here's a guy who really came into this job wanting to help and experienced a bunch of fucking chaos. It's chaos. There's no other better word for it. It's, it's the biggest shit show you'll see is going to an urban environment and being thrust in that because you were, it's not just, that's just saying, it's not just a street. It's internal as well. The whole thing is a big cluster fuck of mismanagement and no one's caring about what we actually need to do. We need to end the damn drug war. This is ridiculous that we're doing this. So that's most of what you're arresting people for. Oh Gosh, I don't, was it all of it?

Speaker 3:          00:39:20       90 90% Jesus fucking Christ. How crazy is that? How crazy is that? 90% that's all that matters. There is guns and drugs, guns and drugs, guns and drugs, guns and drugs and guns probably are there. So they could sell drugs and defend themselves. Defend themselves, right? Yeah. Fucking hey man. What a crazy, crazy situation. Just a bizarre police state set up by the fact that drugs are illegal, man. It does. I mean it invades the entire thing. So when we saw what happened with alcohol, right? So gangs takeover and you have violence. Do you want to lower the violence? Isn't that the mission of the police? Do you want to lower the violence than every single chief out there needs to be saying, hey, we need to end this drug war. Stop it. Yeah. How many cops are saying that we need to stop bars?

Speaker 3:          00:40:11       How about none there a single bar? You know? And that's what causes all the fighting. We all know that if they were all sitting around smoking, they've nothing would have happened. But also I support their right to get fucked up if they want. You know, I'm, I've been drunk a lot and I've never heard anybody. Never, never did anything fucked up. Never cause any crimes. Never heard anybody. Never. You know, I just don't think that human, I think human beings should be able to do whatever the fuck they want. I think when you, when you violate somehow or another, you violate either other people's rights or other people's safety or other people's health and welfare, then it becomes a real issue and you should be prosecuted based on whatever transgressions you've committed. Right. So don't you agree then that the drug war distracts you from actually being 100% real police?

Speaker 3:          00:41:00       100% totally turned you away from it. What kind of relationship did you have with the people in Baltimore that you would, your area, did you develop friendships? Did you develop any sort of connection with those folks? None. I was an occupying force. I handled my stuff and I went out because so so to, to know you. If you were in my neighborhood, I would have to stop and talk to you. I mean, I'd have to spend time with you. I may even have to talk to your kids. We could shoot the shit on the corner or something like that. But the whole time I'm doing that, the the departments are going to actually be criticizing me and I'm not doing my job. Because you're not writing tickets, not pulling people over. You're not, you don't, you're not meeting your quotas. I'm not getting my stats.

Speaker 3:          00:41:42       I'm not making the arrest that I need to make. So I was, I came out of the academy and went and walked foot where Freddie gray is and the Gilmore homes. So that was my first foray. So I got solidified into this, US versus them. You threw me right into the biggest war zone. We have foot, one foot. How many who, who were you with another? Another trainee that had no idea what the hell he was doing. Either. You didn't want to team up with two others. So you're playing cops, right? Totally playing. Wow. And we were doing all drug arrests. So we would go up and we would like go and covert and into the projects because the projects had heat and it was wintertime. So you could like break into one of the doors and it had heat in it and then you could watch what happened in the court yard and people would sell and we would have one of us would run down out of the room, circle around.

Speaker 3:          00:42:28       So you would go and break into a room because it had heat in it. Right? Because their projects there, they, the heat stays on. So it'd be an empty vacant, a vacant apartment, right? Yeah. And the heat would be all on pick the lock or just kicking it. You can't always find a way and just pick a lock. You get a key. There was always a way and someone, someone else usually already did it for you. Right. And we would watch them and like my first arrests went down there and grab them. And the first thing you said was, uh, you know, these aren't my pants because he knew he had the drugs in them. Pants. That's the first guy you arrested. That's hilarious. Boy Did you know you were in for a fucking world of what a great way to start off a career.

Speaker 3:          00:43:09       That's like the perfect way. The first guy you arrest has, these are not, what is my first thing you I grab his arm. So I go there and I go to the southern, which is a area where it's, um, you would be fascinated there. I'm just going to be bluntly honest cause that's the whole point of this is you have a black ghetto, you have white trash for the most part, and then you have this cluster next to it. A really good people, uh, doctors, lawyers, just regular people that in that area that are nice and they mingled together and it's chaos. So I go from that in chaos because college kids that are going to university of Maryland think that they can just walk down the street and to the bad neighborhood and everything will be fine. They think they could drink and walk down the street and nothing's going to happen to them.

Speaker 3:          00:43:54       Uh, the, the, what does happen? They're going to get robbed. They know it. We know. They didn't know we knew it and he's like, Hey, what are you doing? Don't do that. Uh, the, the, the whites and the neighborhood, you would have a really hard time figuring out your reports because you were supposed to put in like who the person's relationship was and you're like, wait, is it your cousin? Is that wait, you, so he's your cousin and your uncle. This isn't making sense. So what block do I put? The guy that did it? Was he your cousin or no, he was your uncle. It's like, nope. And everything was all together. So like there's so much inbreeding really. You actually, you would have these crazy things, uh, that you would have Hispanics that came in and were trying to come up themselves and it was all just go together.

Speaker 3:          00:44:41       It's chaos. You can go there right now and it's just a crazy societal test bed of everybody coming together from these entirely different backgrounds. And there's real inbreeding. Yeah. It's like super common. Everybody knows it. Yeah. Really? What the fuck. So I go from there and I go to inbreeding is like you've, we'd run into that every day. Not every day. Once a week. Yeah. Maybe if you're working there. Hey Man. So I go from there and I go to the northern district, which is this area called Mount Washington. Mount Washington is a upperclass 80% to 90% white. Uh, you have judges that lived there, you have nice houses, 400, $500,000 houses. And now I'm in this environment and it's like, Holy Shit, where am I? Yeah, I'm in white land now. I have this road that's called cost country boulevard and it has extreme next to it.

Speaker 3:          00:45:34       What the hell am I doing here? So I'm expected to get the same amount of arrest and I'm Spec to write, take it. So I have bosses that are telling me like, you're not doing anything like, well, what am I supposed to do? I'm like, in a good neighborhood, what do I do? So I would leave my area, go to the black neighborhoods and make drug arrests so that I could appease my bosses with my arrest numbers. So you're continuing that cycle. Once again, I'm leaving that area to go poach and specifically continue that cycle and I'm doing it because that's what I'm supposed to be doing. So if you were in a place that had no crime, you would get in trouble. Yeah. Yeah. I had my one sergeant had to defend me constantly because I went to a post in that same district where I started bringing the crime numbers down, but I didn't have the arrests and he's, he had to defend me to his bosses saying like, look, he hasn't had a part one a serious crime it in a long time.

Speaker 3:          00:46:32       That's like that's his job. And I was getting criticized the whole time cause I didn't have as many rounds. That's like the ultimate goal, right, is to have no crime. Shouldn't that be the metric that should be, it's not a metric, but if we all had no crime, like I, I've also, I've often proposed this, like if we had a moratorium on crime, if the whole country got together and said, all right, no one for the next month, we can go 30 days without speeding. 30 days without illegal turns. 30 days without any violent crime, 30 days without any theft. What would happen? We'd probably make some up, but make up some crops just to arrest black people. That's what reality is. But that's what we should be. So like my liberal idea of policing would be to empower that officer. That's one of the street. So even if there wasn't crime, than what he would really be doing is making sure that the alley was cleaned up, solving problems that are in the neighborhood. So whatever the problem could possibly

Speaker 2:          00:47:30       be, you know, there's this guy that constantly parts on this corner and the street sweeper can't get it. We'll fix all those problems. So even if you don't have crime, the, the peace officer, the protector should still have plenty of things to do. So it shouldn't be just crime. Crime should be an element of, of what police did. Did you have to pull over people and write tickets for speeding and shit like that? Or Walmart doesn't care about that. They don't care. No. You can just drive crazy pretty much. Really? Yeah. There's, there's no traffic cops or anything like that in the city. What? Um, yeah, it's just doesn't work that way. Um, what, yeah, there's no traffic cops. I mean maybe a district here, there might have one guy that kind of primarily does traffic, but it's just patrol officers are expected to handle traffic.

Speaker 2:          00:48:14       And again, remember I'm not being judged on that, so why would I care? Right. So my car is not, the only reason I do a car stop is to get guns or drugs or maybe a warrant. Like so. So if I turn a plate right and the guy has a warrant driver has a warrant, then yeah, I'm going to do that. So I'm not going to do it unless it's, I haven't a possibility of an arrest. I'm not going to sit there and write bullcrap tickets. Did you arrest the same guys more than once? Yeah. Yeah, plenty of times. Especially when I was doing narcotics. So after I went from the northern, I went to a unit called the violent crime impact division, and it was like plain clothes. Got To have the tats out and be all tough and run around like you are, you are, you know, they called knockers in the city.

Speaker 2:          00:48:53       And so from there you're dealing with the shame street level dealers all the time. And uh, uh, one of those kids actually really struck me. Um, maybe, so a great irony that I had in doing drug work is usually drug works makes you sent you to the deeper into it. And it actually pulled me out because I would interview these guys in the little rooms. And this one guy, Daniel Taylor is the one I'm specifically remembering and he was just a, a marijuana dealer and he had a kid and he was struggling to have this kid. He was young, he was trying to help, but he had gotten a locked up a lot when he was younger. So he was selling weed just like buy diapers for his kid. And he would tell me his stories and we'd be there and he'd be crying and it was just like, fuck, there's no difference between this kid and me.

Speaker 2:          00:49:38       There's nothing. The only difference between this kid and me is that when I had a dime bag in my pocket, there wasn't a fucking chance in hell. Someone was going to look but him, he was going to get caught eventually and it sent him into that spiral. And this could have been a good kid and I wouldn't be surprised if he was still in jail now and there was just nothing wrong with him. We, our whole system created a criminal out of a decent kid and it was, it was shocking to me. Like I, I like I knew I was following the rules and so I had to arrest him. I had to finish this up because it was doing what I'm supposed to be doing, but it was kind of heartbreaking and start to see that these people, they didn't, they weren't different than us. They just had a different environment than us and we should be changing that environment, not changing them. So you felt this was, so let me back up a bit.

Speaker 3:          00:50:27       This going into this district and this new position, why were you allowed to wear regular clothes and what was the idea you're supposed to blend in? So the idea, so you're supposed to have an advantage to sneak up and all that. Then I also, I haven't taught a quick funny story about that, but you're a white guy. This is really good. Sorry. I appreciate it. Okay, so I that's always the struggle, right? So the tattoos, blackface, no, no. Stop it. So why is that bad? I don't understand it. I really don't. Go ahead and set the tats were out. I had a red Mazda six with tinted windows, Virginia tags cut off. Sleeves was rolling down. Thinking I was blending is Zit. I look like I'm some buying. This is going to be anything you consider maybe like carving a lightening bolt and your hair.

Speaker 3:          00:51:12       She could have done something crazy just to look a little more. It's kind of guy was out there by like your trans racial perhaps not opening that kid. They're there or any open, you don't even have to dig in. It's overflowing. I don't have an opinion. I'm so happy that girl's alive and so happy. Just debate is on and it gives you fodder. Well, yes, I'm a fan of human folly. So, so you're rolling around like a white guy sticking out like a sore thumb thinking I wasn't and it turned the corner and literally I was like a four year old boy. He's like, Yo dad have knockers right there. It just as good as I get. This is all I have and I still could blend it. So what was the point there? So they knew that there was a position that cops get into where they, they're allowed to dress like normal people called knockers in Baltimore.

Speaker 3:          00:52:05       And you called knockers by the police department as well or just find out by the civilians. Civilians. And why do you think you're called knockers? Obvious answer. Why knock heads. It's what you do. Oh, I see. On the street, you're the force. You're the enforcement team. So that's actually what it was caused by enforcement team. We went out there and stamp down the drug. Is there pressure to be intimidating to like to you must, yes. You must be intimidating. I wouldn't survive so, so you can look at me and you can think of me being in the wire and Jamie would I have survived? If I was not intimidating. No, no. I wouldn't have survived and still watch the wire. Goddammit. So like a technique is actually to find one of the biggest, baddest dudes in your area and kick his ass punk him. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:52:52       You have to use weapons or would it? How you doing? No, no, no. You're going to arrest him for something. You're going to be a little rough with him. You're going to do something to, uh, cause he's the, he's the king dog in that neighborhood. Right. So you have to a certain the Alpha role. If you don't do that, you're gonna get run over. A lot of cops don't do it. But if you don't do that, you are not going to survive in a drug unit for sure. You're going to get trampled. Why do you, why do you survive if you do do it? I would think you're making an enemy. Yeah. It's a battle. It's a war. It's what it is. It's a drug war. Don't be fooled. That's what it is. That's what we've created. It's so it's US versus them. And if I'm going to be ahead, I have to be the Alpha Dog.

Speaker 3:          00:53:29       Right. You know, I've never obviously never been a cop, but I worked as a security guard for a while at this concert place. And one of the things that I've recognized really early on was that there was a US versus them mentality just from fucking security guards at a concert place. And I would imagine the US versus them between cops and the people on the street gets pretty fucking intense, pretty big division. And that is how you can have a black officer who's participating in a racist organization just like anybody else did. You have a lot of black officers in Baltimore is about, it's about even. Wow. So, but there's no difference. Maybe even the black officers a little bit more aggressive. I have a theory on that, but I, well that was an ice tea thing. Ice Tea, you said talk about that. And I said, yeah, I think that's what they've always felt that there was black cops that made up for the fact that they were black by being extra brutal.

Speaker 3:          00:54:24       And that's what they thought. I don't actually think that that's why, uh, it's conjecture but my part, but I think that's because they're actually, they feel embarrassed that those people, they feel like, like the black criminals are making the black race, the black community look bad. So that kind of like extra angry. Whereas I'm not going to be angry because I don't care. Oh, I see. Huh. Maybe it could be a little bit of both or either or. Certainly. So for different people. Wow. What the fuck dude? What a crazy life you lived. Yeah, I didn't think of it. I looked at the time. Right. But now being out of it, how long did it take before you realize how fucking crazy it was? It started when I was in, but it started with like talking to that kid that was, and then I would also sit and covert and watched.

Speaker 3:          00:55:10       So you'll love this. And one time I was, we were doing a long investigation and I had this vacant building that I would hide in. A homeless dude was there and a homeless dude with like leave magazines for me. And then like I would come in during the day and he would come in at night. It was the weirdest exchange. We never crossed paths though. You would leave magazines for yeah, yeah, yeah. It's the worst cop monthly. No, no, no. It was a cop. I think he legally playboy or he'd lean times or something like that whenever he had. And he knew I was there. I knew he was there, but we never actually crossed paths. But they had a, so he left them for you though? Yeah, man. We both knew we were there and uh, he had a, if there was a big, huge picture of Jesus filling the window, and so I carved out Jesus's eyes and I would stand behind him.

Speaker 3:          00:55:49       And that's how I watched so double meaning Jesus Christ. So I was actually standing [inaudible] watch it, all the drug dealers on the investigation. But while I would watch all these investigations like that, you would see everything for what it was and not for your perceptions because you were there for so long. So I would see the dealer sitting there, but then I would see him take care of his kid. I would see him sit down and make food. I would hear the other people in the neighborhood talking about their lives and hearing the smells of the hearing, the sound, smelling the smells, and realizing that this just wasn't a war. This is ridiculous that we were doing this. This was not the enemy. This was a socioeconomic problem that we had to deal with, but this isn't, this isn't the enemy. We are not at war.

Speaker 3:          00:56:35       That's just preposterous. So by being embedded in their community, you recognize that we really are, are you really were an occupying force and just a a community that's trying to get by and just a bunch of people that are just like you or I, but there are circumstances were unfortunate. They were born into this, this situation where this, this cycle is perpetuated over and over and over again and you've got a chance to see it. All right, let's not fool ourselves. We want all won the lottery here by being born in America. We all won the lottery by being white. So we have to recognize that angel actually did go or if she's not, she's not white. I checked in is plaque. I don't, I get, I don't have an opinion of that. I don't, sure. Don't send me to everybody. Everybody should. Orange is the new black. Right. Right. She's orange. Ever look at her skin.

Speaker 3:          00:57:33       You're wrong. I'm not wrong. Look, she did some good work too. She's a good, uh, she was running the NAACP very well. She's a great job. She was there though. She's got some issues she likes black dudes at, she wanted to fit in. There's a little farther than that. Oh, a little bit. Some people want to be checks. Some people want to be black. Who gives a fuck? Whether it be black. Sure. She's helping. I got you. A lot of people got mad at her though. Yeah, I can imagine. We're getting off track. It's all right. Did other officers share your, your, uh, I want to say like, I don't, I don't want to say humanization, but do your recognition of the fact that these folks are just like you, did other officers have that same feeling? I think a lot of them do, but it wasn't discussed.

Speaker 3:          00:58:18       No. I mean you don't discuss it while you're in. Uh, except for maybe a few people. When I was a sergeant, I had a, a pretty good sphere of influence, so our squad was a little more talkative about things like that and could be open and discuss those kinds of things. Uh, I took an officer once and just put it on plain clothes and kind of walked around the district just not being cops. And that shows you like how much different the neighborhood is then what you think because you go from nine one one call to nine, one one call, it's nine one one call seen everybody at their worst. And when you're not seeing them at their worst, you're hunting for somebody that you can possibly pretend that they're doing at their worst, whether they have drugs on them or or, or whatever. But when you go through the city, it's not at all what you think it is.

Speaker 3:          00:59:02       So even me looking like a prototypical white kid looking to sell to buy drugs in the, in the hood, when I would go through the deal, it's not like the dealers are pushers. I mean, they would come up, Yo, you want a party now and you keep on moving. Sometimes they didn't trust me. I was in too good a shape. They'd be like, no. But they want like, they were like pressuring you. It's not like things were crayons and neighborhood ladies were sweeping their steps, but the neighborhood changes when you have that blue uniform in those lights and your now the authority, you kind of have to see the city for what it's like when you're not there. Right. So your point of view riding in a car, it's like, yeah, there's a filter. Super Myopic. Yeah. Yeah. And you never really get a chance to experience it like a person who lives there.

Speaker 3:          00:59:47       I mean, even if you don't really, if you don't live there, but I mean just you get a better view of it walking around and not, not acting as a cop. Right. It's, it seems common sense that you would do that. What would you think about cops being forced to live in the places that they have to patrol? I think as a trial, that's a real tough situation. It was a real tough argument and very nuanced. Um, I would, there's no way I would live in Baltimore city because I didn't make enough money for my daughter to go to a private school and I wasn't sending her to that school to prison cycle. Right. So I moved the PA where I could send her to a good school and actually afford to now sure if I made enough money. If you're going to pay an officer $150,000 slash $60,000, yeah, he can stay in the city.

Speaker 3:          01:00:30       He or she can st city, but just say Pa, you lived in Pennsylvania, right? So how far away was that from where you were at? 40 minutes. So you would live in Pennsylvania, send your kid to school there and then drive to work. Right. Fuck man. And that's common. So a lot of police live in, in the southern Pa area, driving back and forth in Maryland. A lot of workers period do that. There's a lot of communities around La, like Simi Valley is a big one where there's big communities, a police officer's. Is that the same thing with their, where they just sort of decide live near each other, close together. But you don't do it intentionally? It's, no, it's economically driven. Oh, okay. So it's economically driven. Like you find a place that's affordable, but you don't, you don't, you don't try to move where the other cops live.

Speaker 3:          01:01:12       No, no, I wouldn't want to do that. And we worked with them all day. Well, I know my friends that are cops, they actually did it on purpose or some that live in Santa Clarita or a little deeper than they were pretty deep into that then. Well, you know how it is. It becomes like a gang, right, isn't it? It is. We actually say in the city that there is one gang and that's the blue gangs. So like we don't let people, so aggression is good in a certain extent. We don't let a gang members throw flags like so in my post, if somebody had a red Bandana, blue Bandana, it's taken out of their pocket. That shit was not going down. So you arrested someone who wasn't wrestling? I'm just pumpkin. Pumpkin. So, so you're embarrassing me in front of his friends who take his stuff and you roll out.

Speaker 3:          01:01:52       Did you ever experience resistance? That's sure they're going to resist. If we're going to resist that then it's going to go bad. As long as at you or anything like that? No, nothing. No, because it's the game. So I'm respecting the game. You know, there's a game, the drug game. So I have my role, the drug dealer has his role and we're playing this back and forth and as long as we all play by the rules, everything is fine. As soon as the cops stopped playing by the rules of the game, then you a problem. As soon as they stopped playing by the rules of the game, you have a problem. Does, did, did the futility of it all, was that obvious to, yeah, incredibly obvious. There's, there's no point. So we had a, I remember a case we had where there was a group that was selling drugs and we worked on it for about a week or two, took down the whole group and two days later there was a whole new crew writing the exact same neighborhood, throwing the same product and we were just like, fuck, that was pointless.

Speaker 3:          01:02:43       We just took the all them off. There was no point to it whatsoever. And it was all drugs anyway. It's all trucks. Fucking, hey man, everything is drugs. This, you know, if I was a conspiracy theorist, I kind of been one in the past, but I've mostly abandoned that. But if I was, I would feel like this is engineered. I'd feel like this is just set up to make sure that these people stay poor, that you keep arresting people and you, you keep this cycle going. I don't think you're a conspiracy theorist, is that, I think you're right. Is it because it exists and because the system sort of feeds off of it or was it engineered? I think the prison industrial complex has a huge role in that. So especially with your privatizing prisons, so you're creating a vacancy for a bed that must be filled.

Speaker 3:          01:03:32       So who's going to fill that? So this is where institutionally racism also comes in. I'm not going to fill it with you. We're not going to fill it with me. We're not gonna fit with Jamie. Jamie's sketchy looking at him now we're going to fill it with black people. We like the least, right? As a society of people that you feel like you can demonize the easiest. When that judge got arrested in Pennsylvania for sending kids to jail and juvenile just for money, we really got a view into this world that I don't think would have a, I think a lot of people that opened their eyes, they went, Whoa, a fucking judge. Judges can be that bad. Judges can be so evil, but they would ruin a child's life just so that they could profit off of it. But that's essentially what's going on by keeping the system the way it is today.

Speaker 3:          01:04:19       The Baltimore police, W who was he? The head of Baltimore Police Commissioner and Commissioner, he resigned, or was he fired? He was fired. He was fired. And why was he fired because of all this shit that's going down? Yeah, it's a really hard situation to say. I mean, he's, he's fired because he never led the agency. He's never had the agency ever. We're really don't like outsiders. So when he comes in here from Oakland, from California, now, if he came from Oakland, Oakland's fucked up to Oakland is like one of the worst police brutalities pots and California. You find that to be coincidental? That, and there was an uprising in Oakland and an uprising in Baltimore to agencies. He led this motherfucker. What's he doing now? Put Him in jail. How about that cle lasts, you know, you don't think it's gonna happen to you, is it? No. No. Um, so what is his name again? This guy, Anthony Batts. And what did he do that was fucked up? He just never had the agency. So every never take, you

Speaker 2:          01:05:18       can't. So they come in and they come in with these ideals of what it's like in Baltimore and they don't know what it's like in Baltimore because he knows what it's like in Oakland. And there's, hey Mel. I mean hypothetically, barely. It barely, it seems. Um, so they come in with these, just these ideals and this, uh, I don't know, aura and they're never going to get us. Like, they're never going to get us to follow them. So it doesn't matter what he does, we're not going to follow him. He doesn't, he after the riots, he said he should have trusted his instincts and done more than 10 to rely on his commanders. Thank you. You just threw your commanders under the bus and public and you think this agency is going to follow you. What are you kidding me? So he's a politician says they're all are. That's one of our problems. That's why we have to get money out because we're led by politicians and policing.

Speaker 4:          01:06:06       What could be done? Like if you like let's say this thing becomes bigger and look, I think what you're doing today is very courageous and you're speaking very eloquently and very articulate and you're honest and, and I, I really believe you man. I believe you from the heart 100% there's a possibility that people like you and all these activists that are, they're making these giant protests happen and causing all these people to be aware of all this police brutality and this fucking horrible cycle that these people are or thrust into a guide. Like you could really change something. A guy like you, if you were in a position of power there, there might be something that you could do. Would you consider doing something like that?

Speaker 2:          01:07:01       I would consider it if we had the environment to do so because it's going to be ugly at first because I can't stop the drug war. It's not, it's not in my control.

Speaker 4:          01:07:11       Well, you shouldn't stop the drug war. What? Like what? What if, this is a big hypothetical, but what if we went into some sort of a situation that's competent in this country were drugs became decriminalized, where w the United States woke the fuck up and realized we've been doing the same shit that they did during the fucking twenties during the, you know, prohibition. We're doing the same shit. We're, we're telling people what they can't do. They're not listening and we're feeding organized crime. We're feeding crime that is filling a vacuum just like it's going on in Mexico right now. Just like these poor fucking people that live in these border towns in Mexico. The, it's all being fueled by the fact that drugs are illegal and they're selling these drugs to America. If all of a sudden that changed, how much of an impact would that have on police?

Speaker 2:          01:08:00       It, it'd be striking, uh, that, that again, that's 90% of what I did. So if we would stop doing that, it would be incredibly advantageous.

Speaker 4:          01:08:09       But what would they do with you guys? See what I'm saying? Focus.

Speaker 2:          01:08:13       Let's investigate violence. Let's figure out we're going to fix things. Okay, so use some science to say, we have a problem. What do we do to actually solve this problem? Instead of being fueled by ideology? What are we actually doing?

Speaker 4:          01:08:27       Well, do you saw this recent thing on Obama's gonna release all these nonviolent drug offenders? I mean, that's a good step. I concur completely. That's a great step. Now, if he does that, and the next step is obviously not arresting violent, nonviolent drug offenders, not arresting them at all. Like there's no more arrest for drugs unless there's violence involved. And then you're arresting someone for violence, which is totally reasonable. It doesn't have, it doesn't matter if they're violent over fucking stuffed animals or cocaine who gives a shit. They're violent, right? They're hurting somebody. That's why they're arrested. How much would that transform neighborhoods? How much would that transform this entire cycle of people going from communities that are just engulfed in crime and becoming a part of that themselves because they were unlucky enough to be born there?

Speaker 2:          01:09:17       I think it's the biggest thing we could do as a nation. I only put wolf pack and uh, getting money out of politics ahead of it because I questioned that we can actually do that as money continues to fuel the politician

Speaker 4:          01:09:31       and wolf pack is what's set up by the young Turks. Right, right. Yeah. Let's just fucking fantastic. I love that. There's another thing that my friend Steve Hilton put together called Crowdpac where you could see exactly which politicians are being supported by, by what, where they're getting their donations from and just, and what they vote on and get, get a real clear analysis of their position based on influence, based on the amount of money they're receiving and where it's coming from. So it's all shocking shit because it's, I just would hope that as we move forward as a, as a human race, as we move forward, as a civilization moves forward and we embrace technology and we understand that we have more access to information now than any human beings that have ever lived ever to keep living the same way. Even though we have all these obvious problems right in front of us is ridiculous. I mean it's literally the definition of insanity, doing the same thing over and over again hoping for a different result. And that is the definition of insanity. Right?

Speaker 2:          01:10:32       Totally agree. There's this, there's no way around it that we're doing this wrong. And that's why I'm saying the only reason I'm saying this is because we are doing it so wrong and it's so blatantly wrong. It's, it's like you have to have a cognitive bias to not see this. Like how, how the, it's really the older generation. I kind of pretty much confidence that our generations and younger will be able to solve this and once we get in power, but how they don't see this now is absolutely baffling. And I don't, I think they don't see it because it doesn't affect them. So why should they care? Were you

Speaker 4:          01:11:03       still on the force where the, when that guy got choked to death and Staten Island? I don't think I was when I was Eric Gardner. Yeah, Eric Gardener. That one drove me fucking crazy because there's a video it and you get to see the fact that this guy was so innocent. There's nothing wrong with what he was doing. And he's just hanging out tax evasion. Tax evasion. Exactly. But the idea that these cops are gonna choke to death because he's not paying taxes on loose cigarettes. Not only that, he didn't even have any loose cigarettes on them and they wrestled in the ground, choked him, and then tried to say that it wasn't a choke hold. I mean that one just highlights the difference between the way they treated that guy versus the way they would treat one of their own versus it's a clear us versus them.

Speaker 4:          01:11:45       And they felt like they could do that. They could do that. They had, the papers were signed, they had the directive. It was obvious that it was within their boundaries to take this guy and to physically assault him and arrest him. And so they don't have empathy. So if you wanted to see them, empathy, police, we need to be moral. We need to be human. That's what I'm [inaudible] my main message is we have to lead with empathy. That's the starting point of everything. So if I'm going after that guy, I can immediately see that brother, there's a law or not. The idea that I'm going to take someone's freedom away, like they took his life away, but they were planning to take his freedom away for essentially nothing in stupid tax. That's a penny's that he's providing a service to somebody. If you don't have five bucks and you want a cigarette, that guy's a providing a service.

Speaker 4:          01:12:35       So why don't you, uh, let him set up a little booth and he can take not only that, didn't he paid taxes on those fucking stats? So what? Jesus Christ, I mean, you know, he's making a little bit of a profit, but who gives a shit? Her? No one's getting hurt and no one literally, no one's getting hurt and the money that they could have made just by eliminating the drug war in taxes would make that look like a pittance. It just, the amount of taxes they're getting from Colorado, Colorado is fucking changed. I mean, it is morphing right in front of our eyes and becoming this free utopia. Yeah, you got a lot of dirty hippies there and a lot of fucking homeless people, but that's part of the route you're going to get that they don't bother anybody. I mean, they might bother you a little bit, but whatever.

Speaker 4:          01:13:16       Yeah. Who gives a shit? I mean that's, that's why don't conservative see this. Why don't these days they live in the suburbs then my neighbors, they want money. I mean, that money's going to go to their schools as well. That's going to make it safer for their kid to go to 4th of July in the city that's going to make it safer for all of us. The answer is blatantly obvious that we must end the war on drugs and we must get money out of politics. But we just sit here with are sitting on our hands. Well, I agree with you, but I think you having these kinds of conversations live online in a forum like this where it's going to be distributed to millions of people. You have the opportunity to influence people that might not see things your way because you have a genuine insight in a, in a, in a real perspective that very few people, including me could ever hope to have you saying this kind of stuff and you talk about this kind of stuff can shed some light in a way that other people can. I'm listening to you talk here, man. I'm like, you're the fucking perfect commissioner. You're the, you're the kind of guy that I would want running a police department. You, you're a guy who's been there, a guy who's served the country, been there as a cop, understands what the problems are and, and has solutions and has empathy and really is, you're saying all the right shit. I mean, this is what we need. This is what the police of the departments of the world of this country at least need. We need someone like you.

Speaker 3:          01:14:40       So how do I convince other cops of that? That's, that's my struggle. I don't know man. I mean, I know a lot of cops listen to the fucking podcast. I'll tell you that I, I mean, I dunno if this is going to change them, but they're going to fucking Joe Rogan's hi. Listen in on the streets with us, dude. But you know, you've seen the blue, the blue light sticker, right? Yes. The black on the top, black on the bottom. So we even visualize ourselves the wrong way. So we're this thin blue line and the thin blue line goes to the middle and it separates the good guys from the bad guys. And it makes us neither. Our entire mentality is that we are somebody that's separate. We're not the good guys or the bad guys. We're a separate entity that, that runs this shit and, but that, that shouldn't be that way. There should be like a blurred blue and black. We should be part of the fabric of our society and we should, we should be ingrained in it. But instead we Fitch ourselves like a wall. And we shouldn't be a wall.

Speaker 4:          01:15:36       I think human beings inherently have a problem with power. You know? That's why you see, I mean, you see it across the board when people have power and influence over people alike, it seems to be a natural inclination to abuse it. And it takes someone a very strong character and insight and objectivity like yourself to not do that. Or at least to recognize that you have done that and that it is wrong or that it was wrong. It seems to me that like whether it's politicians or whether it's the military or whether it's, what are some of the like fucking Bill Cosby, you know, like how does a guy become that guy? Well, I eat has to be out of power, you know? I mean it's the power even even just might be a stretch, but the power to drug someone, the, the ability to do that and yeah, if it's like how, what it is, what is it about human beings that that makes them exploiting people that are below them instead of trying to raise those people up to their level. There's some fundamental lack of understanding about the brotherhood and sisterhood of the human race that gets, it all gets fucked up when you have a job. And it seems to me that if you have a quota and if you have a boss that's telling you you need to arrest more people, you need to lock up more people. Like these streets are too safe. You're either, either you're doing the right thing or you're not doing enough. And they almost always think not doing enough. Right.

Speaker 3:          01:17:10       They never would think, oh, this guy got lucky and he created a good relationship with all these people and we locked up all the bad guys and all the people in the community that are left are all safe. There's no more violent criminals. It's a beautiful utopia of a neighborhood. And we never, never have to arrest anybody there ever again. So cops would just be there, just sorta say hi and patrol the streets. Yeah, that sounds like a great idea. And, but you see it, you see that. So you see it. So the first step is to recognize it. It's so do we have a problem with power we have as human beings? Maybe we do. So let's acknowledge that and put measures in place so that we don't exceed our power boundaries have some checks and balances in law enforcement because we have zero.

Speaker 3:          01:17:53       We did away with everything we want to get away with until there's a camera. The only difference, all these other things that you've seen in the past. You've heard these stories of guys getting shot unarmed, but yet he was attacking my gun or he was taking my gun. How much do you really believe those now? Well we saw that the one where the guy in South Carolina shot the guy in the back and then drop the Taser, walked up to him and through the Taser down near his body. I mean there's drops anything. There's a video of it. I don't know if the other cops saw it. I don't know. I'll do it. It's right in front of them. You saw them doing nothing of it cause it's video cause it's normal. It's normal. We're not the only saw. The one guy is the other guy in the video.

Speaker 3:          01:18:27       The other guys see the Taser cause it's obvious that he sees it. I mean he's the first stand right next to him on he, I don't, I don't know. But the fact that he shot him in the back while I was running away, I mean that's kind of fucking crazy. It's crazy. Is that guys being charged for murder, right? Yeah. Well that's nice. But it's because anybody, right? Nobody ride it there. Why? Because they don't get all, they're all booked. All of the uprising. Deray was booked things. What happened with Deray? You got them to not this guy, deray is a, a really noble activist and I appreciate everything this guy is doing and I appreciated him, uh, making Wolf Blitzer look like a fucking idiot on TV. But uh, he had me blocked for some reason, but you got them to unblock me. I got them to unblock you.

Speaker 3:          01:19:14       What? I think it's totally conjecture, but I think he's just leery of us. And I understand that white people, us, we're in the same group. Yeah, I think so. And He's white. He blocked me because I'm white. That that has something to do. No, his blocking has something to do with something. He thought that you said. What do you think? I said, I don't remember. But how can you remember that? Now you're gonna have to talk to him. Okay. You can't say it. No, I mean, I just don't know enough and I didn't dig. It was just not my business. Okay. So he thought I said something racist. I don't know what he thought he said. He said he thought you said something that he didn't, you didn't like. And I just said, you know, trust me, he's fine. He's, he's, he's one of the good guys. Don't worry about it. Okay. Maybe I said a joke. Even my said something off color. It's always hard with being a comedian, man. Maybe heard me talk about Trans racialism and how I support it. I think he's probably a little brief on that. And so like, should be,

Speaker 1:          01:20:08       but why not? Fuck it. He's a good guy and I hope things, but I know his lack of trust. Well, I understand. I guess. Um, but I understand not, not, I don't understand this lack of trust in me. I just don't understand that I'm so trustworthy, but I understand what he's doing and I think it's spectacular. He to me is a real activist as opposed to Al Sharpton who just makes my fucking blood curdle. When I see that guy show up at any fucking event that has anything to do with black people at was Jesus fucking Christ. Like I got this more harm than he does good. Just by his just greasy past is history and they just, there's so much about him that's just so wrong and it's nice to see someone like deray come along. It's nice to see a real activist. Someone who is intelligent, is articulate, is doing all the right things and I think between a guy like that, but trying to, between many people I can, I'm sure there's a lot more people like him that I'm not aware of.

Speaker 1:          01:21:05       And then someone like you who shedding light on this from the inside. I think things are slowly but surely turning. I think the battleship is moving in a different direction. I really do. I really think the whole country is moving in a different direction. And I think that when we see the way people are approaching gay rights now, the way this, the way the world is just more sensitive about things. And some people are angry at it as saying everyone's over-sensitive. I think it's probably better to be over sensitive than it to be insensitive cause over sensitive can be corrected. And people were like, well, the people who are, you know, there's lives are being ruined because people were being over sensitive. You know, there was a Nobel prize winning doctor or a professor that, um, made a joke about women in science and he said they should probably have a same sex labs because, uh, three things happen when women are in the labs.

Speaker 1:          01:22:02       He said, either they fall in love with you or you fall in love with them or they cry when you criticize them. And he was joking around against allegedly and he had to resign. He had to resign for that, for something like that. You know, they say equality and science is more important like that, that mother curing cancer. All right, this guy's a Nobel prize winning scientist and he says something that's a little goofy but it doesn't have some history of oppression. He's not some terrible person is. It's this massive over sensitivity by people where you can't even just, you know, say that's probably not a good thing to say. And He, you know, can kind of correct it and you can kind of smooth it out cause you understand the people talk off the top of their head. This is not like a fucking story wrote for the New York Times where he made it had a clear position on women in science and it became a real issue because he criticized people that might have gotten into science and done some real good work. Now this guy, the guy's just talking, you know, and I think symptoms like that, like the, these issues that we face,

Speaker 4:          01:23:06       it's way better to have the APP than it is to have insensitivity. I think the over sensitive things like that, it's, it sucks at this guy got fired, but, or that he resigned but he shouldn't have. And I buy, I blame the institution. I blamed the people running for that, that are so fucking sensitive that they, they, and, and so terrified that they're worried about any criticism whatsoever, that they reacted to it and this way and him, he shouldn't have fucking back down from it. Either he's going to talked about it and explained or maybe an apologize. Maybe you even said it was an off color joke or it was just, I just think that that balance is, is because we're moving in the right direction. I really do. I think I, even though I've been a victim of over sensitivity, um, I shouldn't say victim.

Speaker 4:          01:23:46       That's sounds very grandiose. I, it's, it's, it's affected me or it's impacted me or I've felt it. I've seen it rather, I think it's better. It's better to have all those fucking crazy people running around looking at things to be offended about looking at a, you know, examples of sexism or homophobia or racism. It's, it's better to have people reaching too far than to not reach it all. And I think because we're seeing all this stuff, I think it's evidence that society as a whole than our, our culture in America is tipping towards being more aware. And I think that's a good thing. I really do. Um, I have a lot of hope, you know, a lot of people think that I'm like, well, overly optimistic about the future of this country and the human beings in general. But I'd see plenty of evidence that people are aware and that they care and just all the people that are paying attention to your story and all these different protests and marches and all these different news stories when any, whenever we see these examples of police brutality, it's, there's so highlighted now, this is not swept under the rug at all.

Speaker 4:          01:24:54       And if anything, the cops are fucking thrown under the bus immediately. I mean, is it, it's a different world and I think there's going to be an adjustment period. But I think ultimately when we look back at this time, 10 20 years from now, I think we're going to look at this as a shift, as a shift in our culture that we didn't see in the 60s you know, there's, when I think when the, when Martin Luther King was around and when there was a shift, then there was most certainly a, an a, an awareness, a civil rights awareness. But I think it's even bigger now. I really do. I think this is a great time to be a human being. I really think that we have the real potential to make some real change inside our lifetime and change that can give momentum to the future.

Speaker 2:          01:25:43       I think there's, without question that you're completely right, they can't avoid it. I mean we're, we're, technology has made us communicate. We see everything. We can't hide as much anymore. We just have to be human and recognize all of our flaws and everything will be fine with your doctor. If we could have some empathy for his position because empathy a two way street, then maybe you can work out a solution for understanding and that ball game and that's what we're doing now is where we're working out the understanding and it's going to have this ugly period in policing for sure, but we'll get through it and it's going to be better. It's inevitable. I don't think it's me. It's going to be somebody that comes behind me, but it's going to, it's going to work

Speaker 4:          01:26:22       well. Yeah, I think you're a part of it. Uh, I think we're all a part of it. I think someone like you is uniquely qualified to be a part of it. You know, the fact that you actually, or they're on the street arresting dude is wearing somebody else's pants. I think it just shows you're uniquely qualified to talk about this. And I think that there's a real potential with this kind of dialogue and with people just being more and more aware of it that a young kid that might be like 1617 years old right now that is about to go into the marines and has the same idea that you had. He has a leg up. Maybe he can learn from your experiences and maybe his comrades and maybe his, his peers can also learn from what you're saying and your experiences and maybe someone like you one day becomes a commissioner and maybe that time while that's happening that that one commissioner starts listening to good politicians and it gets influenced by good leaders and doesn't have to start arresting people just for drugs, doesn't have to PR just perpetrate this same stupid fucking cycle that's been going on and on.

Speaker 4:          01:27:32       I mean is that too much to ask? Is that too unrealistic to hope that we can change things? I mean you can't, you can't think that we're not going to improve if we're not going to, we're going to stay stagnant as a culture. Well that's, that's ridiculous. That's shitty engineering. That's non non thinking. That's are you always saying that we're perfect? Are we saying that it's few tile? Are we saying that it can't be fixed or are we saying that we're not willing to try? One of the one of those is happening.

Speaker 2:          01:28:01       The majority is not willing to try but you even, I don't think I belong on the pedestal. You're put me on maybe somebody else wants because I participated in all of this. Maybe we can have people that go on.

Speaker 4:          01:28:13       It's on a pedestal. I'm not putting you on a pedestal. I'm just saying your, your, your, your hope, what you're doing. This is hope. You

Speaker 2:          01:28:24       influenced that though with this. Okay, so you have this philosophy where you were like it doesn't matter what you do, just fucking be nice. Just be nice and listening to youth through these years, that has invaded my mind as well. So if we can just talk and start opening up as humans and be nice and be empathetic, then we're going to work that all of this out regardless. Bernie Sanders might even be a good example of that with his message right now. Huge following. Right. And like vote for this guy. Yeah. I mean we're going to make changes. It's like if you're a progressive then you want to make changes. If you're a conservative,

Speaker 4:          01:29:02       you want to stay in the past. This is what these words mean. It doesn't make any sense. Who would want to be conservative and stuck in the past? The only person is going to be stuck in a past is one with the confederate flag that's collecting money off the backs of somebody else. Well this a definition of conservative, I think it's all fucked up. Now conservative should be someone who's fiscally conservative. That and then the, which is someone who's prudent, someone it makes good financial choices. That's a good thing. That's a smart thing. It's someone with discipline that's, I support that 100% you know, good financial decisions or that is a conservative thing. You know when you start getting socially conservative that means you're white. That's what it means. You might as well say you're white, you know, or you're a black guy. He likes hanging out with white people and being paid more than he's worth.

Speaker 4:          01:29:47       Cause you know, that's what happens. I mean it's, we live in a weird world right now and I think society is being redefined right in front of our eyes. I think when we look back at this time, a hundred years from now, when people look back when we're dead, they're going to look back and go, guys, a fucking crazy time to be alive. That Internet just fucking threw a monkey wrench into the whole gears. Kaklink you know, I mean that's really what's happening. The, this, this ability to communicate just didn't exist before you being able to come on a show like this. This is never, this wasn't supposed to happen. No, not at all. If we, if this show was on the radio or something like that, first of all we'd be interrupted by commercials and then second of all, someone will probably tell us we can't talk about these things or we can't talk about like the way we're talking.

Speaker 4:          01:30:31       You can't swear. We had already been arrested for swearing. You can get a fucking fine, have some insane amount. I think it's like $250,000 for swearing on the radio for swearing. Like just saying, get the fuck outta here on the radio. You can go to jail if you don't pay that, fine. If you don't pay that quarter million dollar fine. The vig to the government that they, that's where Howard stern came in. Man, Howard stern fought all that shit. That's why that guy is always going to be a hero to me. I don't give a fuck what he says about podcasting or Ari should fear already that crazy shit that it wasn't for that guy. That guy fought the fight and the powers that be, that have set this stupid thing up. They didn't anticipate that a guy like you would be able to go on the young Turks later this afternoon and say anything you want man, and that young Turks thing will be seen by fucking million people.

Speaker 4:          01:31:18       Easy. And that's, that's hope, man. That's hope. Because what we're talking about where you listen to some of the things that I've said, those things that I've said I've heard online, you know I've read, I've watched documentaries, I've, I've, I'm expressing things that I've learned and we all learn from each other and we, all the community that we create by finding likeminded people or by saying things that resonate with people or by influencing people in a positive way where it actually helps their mindset and helps their life and they become thankful of that. And then they spread the same kind of message and we help spread it to each other. And I could have a guy like you want and you change the way I think about certain things and you influence. Like I'm, I'm genuinely honored to have you on the show. I'm genuinely, I really admire what you've done and what you're saying.

Speaker 4:          01:32:07       And I think other people will as well. And I think it spreads, it's like a good virus. Like it gets out there and this, this wasn't available before. Something like this wasn't available. And I think that's part of why we all got locked into this US versus them mentality. We didn't have a voice that distinguishes or differentiates from the fucking same bullshit corporate voice that we keep hearing over and over and over again. That doesn't differentiate. You don't hear any, you don't hear any. We are all brothers and sisters on Fox News. You don't hear that. What do you hear? You hear crimes, statistics. You know, you hear Nancy grace with two Chainz debating about marijuana. I mean he really, that's what you hear. You hear bullshit nonsense. You don't hear any soul. You know, no one's got a goddamn heart, no one, no one recognizes the fact that this is a temporary existence.

Speaker 4:          01:33:03       We're going through a temporary existence and there are so many of us and there's pockets that seem almost unmanageable because they've been fucked over for hundreds of years and there's just a swarming chaos in these areas and they just, they're riding a momentum and they're riding on the momentum of decades and decades of poverty and crime and a cycle of despair and is going to be hard to fix that shit. But it's critical and it's one of the most important aspects of our civilization. If we don't fix that, our civilization is nonsense. Our civilization is only as strong as the weakest links. And it just makes sense to me. And I've always said this, the best way to strengthen America. People want to talk about a strong America. Are you a patriot? Do you love America? Good, less losers, make less losers. Then you have a stronger America. Go to the fucking neighborhoods that are fucked.

Speaker 4:          01:33:55       Go to the communities that are fucked. Go to these deeply entrenched in crime areas and fix them. You fix them. Then you got winners. You got instead of 10,000 people in jail, he got 10,000 people that are starting small businesses. You've got 10,000 people that are venturing out into the world and trying to do good and influencing other people to do the same and spreading a positive message and and influencing people with inspiration. And then they, the other people see, hey this guy became this. I can do this too. And then they do it too. And then other people say that. And you've got a better country. It's, it's not that hard. Instead of being a fucking vampire and arresting people for crack and pulling people over and doing the same goddamn shit that everybody's been doing for the last hundred years,

Speaker 2:          01:34:41       it's striking how much we do things similar. One of the things we found when we were messing around digging through files is we found a, an action plan a and these action plans like so a big crime happens and you, you're the shift commander were drop an action plan and send it up. What he's going to do to address this and this action plan was from the 1970s we found it in like 2010 whoa. And you found it. We found it in a drawer and it was the exact same action plan as the other shift commander was doing. It was like the same, the same corners, the same response, the same plan. So like for 40 years, nobody's changed anything and you have the same corners being the same problems with the same families and the doing the same things and the police are doing the exact same goddamn thing in response.

Speaker 2:          01:35:26       Wow. It's, it's unbelievable how we're doing this. And that's what these talks have to get us to do is to do exactly what you're saying. Communicate, lift up the country. It doesn't make any sense that we would treat a medical problem like it's a criminal problem and put those people into a jail to drug addicts into, into a jail cell. It doesn't make any sense. I'm sorry. What? What happens to the cop on the beat right now in Baltimore? What happens to the cops that are listening to this right now? What the fuck can they do? These guys have an incredibly hard time right now because like you're saying with bats, he's not leading the agency properly. The FOP is doing some crazy things as well, uh, to calling the uprising lynch mobs, going after the wanting to send their officers down the pike and doing all these things when we need justice.

Speaker 2:          01:36:16       We need something. The case needs to be heard in court for anybody to have any assemblance that this is going to be real. And this is going to be just because in the past we know it's all been covered up. So if we continue to cover up, which is the problem that happened in Ferguson is the cover up. The problem isn't the shooting problem is that damn cover up that prosecutors a criminal, he criminally covered up that indictment. There's no way around it. That's what they did and no one seemed to care. So what did he do? Highlight what? What happened? So when you have an indictment, the old saying is as you can indict a ham cheese sandwich because the, the prosecutor goes up there and his job or her job is to select the, the evidence that will get the charge. So the way that system actually is is if there's, there's four of us in the room right now.

Speaker 2:          01:37:01       If three of us think he did it and one doesn't, we don't even listen to the one that does it. That's how an indictment works. If you're not relying to witness, you don't even come in for the indictment. But in that case, he brought in unreliable witnesses, brought in everybody to taint the whole thing when all he should have brought in was the case that, okay, so this guy was shot and he was found this way and these witnesses say that he put his hands up and you would have had an indictment and you would have had a trial and you would've, he would've, I think that shooting was justified. So Darren Wilson would have been exonerated and everything would've been fine, but we would at least heard the case. The problem is, is that the police walk away with nothing, so it's like you shoot him, oh no, we're not going to indict it.

Speaker 2:          01:37:48       Okay, see you later. Good luck. Looks like everything was clear. Well, we need to see more than that. That's why when you see the indictments, South Carolina, there was no uprising. We, we had a shooting in Baltimore just not too long ago where a guy was robbing a seven 11 I think in the officer came in and shot them. There's some speculation that the guy wasn't even armed, but he was robbing a store so nobody freaks out. The problem is is when you have somebody on our end, but no clear crime and it's just, okay, that's what happened. He was afraid what fear is not enough justification to shoot somebody. But that's what the law says. The law says that if you're in fear of your life as an officer, you can pull that trigger. That's preposterous. You have to at least be some assemblance of containing your situation and not just being what it is now as they're afraid at everything.

Speaker 2:          01:38:31       So everybody has a gun, which you know that's an American problem, but they feel like everybody is a threat and you're ingrained into this threat. So they run around with fear and they have your shoot in a heartbeat because they're so afraid. And then the scene, they just come behind and they cover it all up like nothing happened and that's when you get an uprising. It's just when there is no justice. That's what Marilyn Mosby did, you know, like okay. Did. Was there uprisings after she came out and said, okay, we're going to charge the officer's? No, because it's not that everybody's rushing to judgment. It's not that it's a lynch mob. It's let this play out in court. I think the two lower officers are going to get off. I don't think that they did anything particularly wrong. They were following their lieutenant. They might have some things.

Speaker 2:          01:39:10       They might not be cops, but they didn't do anything terribly wrong. But you want to hear the case and you want to know what happened. We have to know what happened. Just because a guy has a gun and we give them a badge and he has a GED and he went to eight months of training. Doesn't make him above the world. It doesn't make him a separate set of rules. What you think that the Ferguson shooting was justified? I can't go far as to say it's justified. I think the evidence would say that it, it would be rule justified. I don't know why. Because he struck the officer and he is a close range and it seems like he was trying to get his gun. Yeah. If, I mean in that situation I think you get the benefit of doubt to the officer. But why were there so many people that disagreed?

Speaker 2:          01:39:53       What was the hands up and all that stuff? Right. Who knows? Did he have his hands up? Was that, who knows? But I think that's enough justification to find that out. Right. And how would they find that out? At least have the witnesses on Stan. But it would just be questioning witnesses. It would just be I witness information. Sure, sure. But let's hear it. You know, maybe he gets out, but it's exonerated and everything's fine, but let's hear it. We need to, here we have, we know that we have a history of officer's unjustly shooting black males, especially on armed. We know we have that so that that means we must have an extra level of scrutiny. We have to, and what is the situation in Cleveland with the kid? A 12 year old kid that had the, that was at the school yard there.

Speaker 2:          01:40:38       That guy's being indicted on murder charges. Right. Last I knew he wasn't that judge suggested that he, there was a judge that said there was enough probable cause to warrant the charging, but somebody else actually has to do that charging. I don't believe that's taken place so that one doesn't make any fucking sense at all. Fucking murder is a murder. It's absolute. There's no justification for that. There's not been a single thing I've ever watched that that affected me more than watching those fucking cops murder Tamir rice and then stand over that boy, a 12 year old boy as he was bleeding out and choking, they stood there and they, he's worried conjecture, but it looks like he's worried. Oh my God, I'm in this situation. What am I going to do as a 12 year old boy fucking chokes on his own blood dying and he stands there, stands there doing nothing until someone else comes over and finally helps that boy and he's not being indicted.

Speaker 2:          01:41:28       Are we kidding me? That's fucking murder and shot him within two seconds. It was lesson 1.6 seconds. They rush up on that kid. There's no justification for any of them. What's happening in Cleveland is absurd. There's no doubt about, is Cleveland like Baltimore at the same sort of cycle? I have no reason to believe that Cleveland, Baltimore, Ferguson, Atlanta, any of those places are different. I think we can take an officer. There's some just happened in Philly just now before I walked in here. A video was released of Philly officer's a 12 Philly officers beating on somebody that was on armed for apparently riding a bike or something like that. I have no, I didn't get a chance to see. But all of these things seem to be the same. So if you took an officer out of Philly, you can put them in Baltimore. He's fine. When we had Hurricane Katrina, we took, uh, maybe 20 officers from New Orleans and brought them into the BPD and they, there's not like, they like, oh my God, what are we doing? It was the same. Same thing. Same Shit, same shit. Different report. That's all. So it's just ghettos.

Speaker 2:          01:42:32       Ghettos. Yes. A black guy goes to a separate, a separate level. Black ghettos, mostly black, low income period. It's the power list, the voiceless period. But I think that institutional racism that we have throughout our society, it wasn't that long ago that we're having slaves and were still arguing over the confederate flag.

Speaker 4:          01:42:50       I know you said something about they're arguing about the dukes of Hazzard. I think you confused sir. Yeah, they're fucking, how about the fact that it flies over state house until 2015 it's God damn crazy. Yeah. The fact that this is the first year that someone stepped up and stop that from happening and then people are freaking out. It's about heritage southern narrative. Imagine, imagine a Nazi flag Nazi flag flying up. I mean, oh, come on. What did you say though about that flag? Come on. I saw you say something. What was it? Oh, I said about daisy Duke. I said the real flag was the, the daisy dukes. The shorts, because that was a flag of empowerment. There's it never been. It was an article of clothing. Well for females and for gay men, sluts and gay men. That's, there was never an article of clothing that's, that just clearly outlined that you're hungry for Dick.

Speaker 4:          01:43:41       There was one that we've ever created and that's the daisy Duke shorts. Nobody wears daisy Duke shorts if you don't want Dick, if you're a dude and you were in daisy Duke shorts hunting for Dick and if your girl, we're in daisy Duke shorts, you're hunting for deck and there was never like a flag. They like, they threw up a flag that let up, let people know they want some deck and I have an objection. It's true, right? It's true. That's the, that's the real fucking travesty. What they should do is go over that fucking show, put the show back on the air. God dammit, go over that show at some CGI. Put a Goddamn American flag on the roof and let's be done with it. How long, how much would that cost? They could do that shit if they could make the Hawk and the Avengers bounced through buildings and shit.

Speaker 4:          01:44:21       You told me. Yeah. You can't fucking fake a flag on the roof of up. First of all, the real crime is to paint that fucking beautiful car, that shitty color. You took us 69 charger or a 68 charger, whichever one wants to think is this nine one of the most beautiful muscle cars ever created. And you painted it like you goddamn Spanish hooker. The bullshit. That's the real bullshit. Paint that fucking thing. Orange was stupid flag of a bunch of losers. That's a loser flag by the way. Yeah, you heard me folks, y'all lost treasonous assholes. It's like raising a flag or another country anyway, did well, it's like raising a foe. They wanted to win and they didn't win was about economics. It's about economics. Yeah. If you don't pay people, you make more money. So that's an economic choice.

Speaker 4:          01:45:15       You know, the south represents and that flag represented a lot of things to people other than racism. What they need is a new flag. You need a new flag that represents the south alone and not a bunch of people that were fighting to keep racism. You know, Dan Carlin said that, um, they should add to the flag, like maybe keep that flag and put a broken chain on it that represents the, the abolishment of slavery that like, it keeps southern heritage within an ads. One thing to it, I mean, that might be a thing, but they could come up with another fucking flag. It's a flag. It's just a symbol. If you want a symbol of the South Texas has a fucking beautiful flag. Texas has a flag and the star of Texas and nobody ever thinks of it representing racism or represent, it's just fucking Texas.

Speaker 4:          01:46:00       The Star of Texas. It's just the star of Texas that's legit. Like if you were a Texas flag t shirt on, everybody knows. Wow. That's the guy who was a fan of Texas. You know what I'm saying? It doesn't have any connotation that you hate black people or you want racism or you want slavery. That's a, that's a legit flag. They need to come up with a goddamn better flag up for world with no flags. A world with no flags. Mm hmm. Okay. What about the don't tread on me. That's pretty slick. I like that one snake. Oh No, no. Nobody say, I mean everybody has had it. Don't try it on the side, but you really have, are they scared of those people? How about an eagle? Probably either the fucking talent, fuller rockets, rockets and one and then the other one a dick.

Speaker 4:          01:46:45       He's got a dick in one hand. Represent everybody just talking shit. I just think that uh, yeah, the world, a world without flags, like ideally no ideology, you know, ideally no, uh, no borders. Ideally no nationalism, no state pride and just be proud that you're a human being and human race. But there's some cool shit about having differences. There's some cool shit that you can go to New Mexico and it's different than going to Michigan. I liked that. I liked variation. I like people that are happy that they live in Los Angeles. They have pride straightening your nice here.

Speaker 3:          01:47:21       Yeah, I like it. I never been to the west coast. We were just driving around. We went up the Pacific coast today, coastal highway today, and uh, the canyon, I can't remember his, call it Malibu Canyon. Beautiful one of my bikes so bad I was hurting. It's like, where can I rent them? Motorcycle. Malibu Canyon road is amazing and it was unbelievable what? We've never seen anything like that. But in the northeast we have water.

Speaker 4:          01:47:41       Oh yeah, yeah. We'll still water from Seattle. They ain't gonna do shit about it either. Stop, take that water, son. Give me that shit. This is what I think. If they could bring fucking oil down from Alaska, why can't they bring water? They can hook a big tube up to one of those melting glaciers and you steal all that fucking water and we're good. And then we irrigate the shit out of this bitch and turn into a tropical rain forest. Just giant sprinklers that are in the sky. You know, giant ones like 30,000 feet up, just spraying shit. Come on, man. You can make a hyperloop. They can get to San Francisco in five seconds. Like what Elon Musk is trying to do. You can't put a sprinkler system in the sky. I think you can't steal water out of the icebergs that everybody's worried about. Global warming with the iceberg smelt.

Speaker 4:          01:48:26       The Malibu is going to disappear. Fuck it is. We're going to put a big goddamn too and suck all those icebergs. It's sprayed all over the avocado fields. That sounds crazy to watch up either solution. It is a solution. It's why not. If you can get oil from Saudi Arabia by millions and millions of gallons and tankers and bring it across the god Damn Ocean to America, you're telling me you can't take water from somewhere and bring it down here. That's stupid. Of course they can. The problem is can they get enough water? Cause we use a lot of fucking water. There's a lot of golf courses here. People like to call off a lot of white people and there's almonds. Almonds apparently suck up a lot of water and a lot of people have pools. There's a lot of issues, but I think they can be engineered. You know the real issue is, you know, there's a lot of global warming talk, but I think Pete places have always turned, you know, there's always been like air.

Speaker 4:          01:49:21       I mean, all you have to do is just look back to the ice age and you realize, well, there's not an ice age anymore, so something happened. There's some change. Well that's this. We don't live in this static place, but we're so arrogant. We figured out, we feel like if we build a city, we could stay. You know, this is it. We're here now. But if this becomes a Sahara, you know there's a go to this hair does it? What do you find? You don't find a lot of fucking people. There's a reason. There's nothing there. You can't live off of it. What do you, what are you going to eat, man? You can eat your camel if you don't eat your camera. There's not a lot to eat, you know? And that's just the reality of being a human being. If we live on this earth, we occasionally you have to move because the spots socks.

Speaker 4:          01:49:57       Now, you know, this spot is fantastic. You're this, you're here for the first time. But listen, there's a reason why there's 30 million fucking people stuffed into this area. It's because it's a sweet spot. But all it take is one of those, the, the rock style earthquakes from that new fucking movie. One real one, which has happened before. They've had some giant ones in spots all over the world that we know of. You know, that human beings don't have record of that had just been just unbelievably devastating. All we'd need is one of those just one. And everybody would scatter like ants. And then you go to boulder, Colorado, be over one with chicks from Santa Monica.

Speaker 4:          01:50:38       It'd be dudes on Adderall with fucking botox faces driving the Tesla's around boulder. Hey, that's, it's become, it's a nice car. It's fast too. It's a good car. Beautiful. Um, but you guys, it's too cold in Baltimore. That's bullshit. Yeah. We had a bad winter. It's nothing. I grew up in Boston, which is worse, way worse through though. Uh, how that city, uh, it's all right. It's okay. You can fucking have it for five months. A year and a yes, that's right when summer time. So I'm still talking about my house at a bit summertime in Boston's amazing. It's like I'm, I'm going to Chicago, uh, at the end of the month and I'm fucking site because Chicago in the summer is amazing. You know why? Because those people appreciate the fact that it's the summer, summer in la every day. It could be 90 in January here. I mean it's happened many times, right?

Speaker 4:          01:51:31       Jamie? You experienced 90? Yeah. Walking around in shorts. Flip flops. Tee Shirt. Nineties beautiful. January convertible 75 [inaudible] 75. It's nice. I know. It's a nice day to day. It was 60 this morning when I woke up. I had to get up early. It was 66 zero. Mm. Yeah. That doesn't happen for us. No, right now it's brutally hot. Yeah. Well you guys get that swampy hot. Too Nasty. Yeah. That east coast hot is a different kind of hot like Miami. You don't even know what hot is until you experienced Miami and August. It might as well be in Africa. Even the God damn jungle. You know, I, we hear a funny car chase story. I want to hear all your funny car chase stories. Okay. How many got three? Okay. So my first car chase, this is, this is how far after the guy having some other dude's pants on, uh, about a year. A year. So a year. And so I have a partner. You usually don't have partners in Baltimore at a partner on this particular day? Yeah. You ride by yourself. What, what does that to save money? Uh, I think more of an omnipresence idea. Oh, the more people that are more cops, more cause it doesn't really work, I think every jerk off in your car. No, no

Speaker 3:          01:52:46       one told me that. Real quick, just to ask you. I would, I get bored. So I have this partner, he looks like Sammy Davis Jr. Oh Jesus. Great Guy. Great Guy. We'd go to calls. Did you call him Sammy Davis Jr? I mean, maybe sometimes joking and he was dead. He looked that bad. You're kind of a Sinatra when he was younger. Oh. Can you see Sinatra when you're buying? Nobody else thought of that. Now hold on a second. Pull up the Sinatra's Sinatra's mugshot. He was a tiny dude. You know, snapchat only weighed like 125 pounds. No, no, no, not you. You're, you're handsome. Like Sinatra muscular and big. I get it. But being not tiny,

Speaker 1:          01:53:23       your, your average guy, but I'm saying Sinatra was like 130 pounds. He was like a tiny dude. Look at that. Come on dude. You're a little better looking than him. I'll be honest. What is, where's his a, what do they arrested him for it? Because it was like a little card that had the, uh, there's a thing below it. There was a, I used to have it on my wall at home actually. It's not that one, but uh, he was arrested and it had its site and wait for carrying on with a married woman. Yeah, yeah. It was called seduction. That's what he got arrested for. But that's not the, there was actual real piece of paper from the arrest that you can, uh, you could see they had it like handwritten and everything when he was arrested for, see if we could find it. But it had his, uh, his height and weight and I'm pretty sure he's 130 pounds and he was like five, six or five, seven. He's like a tiny little dude, which I never would thought. I thought, you know, Frank Sinatra would be like, it's just larger than life, you know? I mean like Tom Cruise kind of thing. No, I think Tom Cruise is probably not as short as everybody says. Right? Yeah. I mean he might be a little shorter, like five, seven may be, but everybody said he's like five too.

Speaker 3:          01:54:37       People are just mean. Creem my partner, he was about five, two, five, three. Oh, Sammy Davis Jr Jesus Christ. And he would cop, what does he punish me as? Good. Yeah. So good. Cause he planted then like nobody noticed him. Oh right. And when he wa yeah, no one's scared of five to Buckeye. Right. We would go to places and he would be the nicest cop. I mean, he was like, like what you think the top is? That was him. He was so nice, so courteous, and I'd show up behind me like sit down and shut the fuck up. Oh, you're a bad cop. He would get the complaint. I wouldn't. Unbelievably hilarious. I don't know why. It was just a running joke with us cause he bought, I can't throw that conjecture out there, but most likely I would have thought of that I thought was just, they didn't like it or they liked me.

Speaker 3:          01:55:19       I don't know. I never thought of it as being a racial thing. So we're going down a road and we type a tag in a car and it comes up, boop, boop, boop. The stolen car. Oh Shit Dude, it's fucking dog. Are we going to do, why would it be whispering? I don't know. But you start to panic. And I was like, all right, fuck it. Let's just get out and I'll just yank him out of the car real quick because we're stuck in traffic. Right? So go out. As soon as I jumped out of the car, looks over at

Speaker 2:          01:55:44       me, the driver of the car, and he slams down his, his lock door lock. I'm like, fuck. So I tried to rip the door open and I can't do it. So for some reason, instinctually I pull out my guide and I'm like, get out of the car. And he's like, no, fuck you. And it starts to turn green and these get ready to go. So I take my gun and I hit it against the window. The window doesn't break my gun. Does the rounds go flying on the ground, scattering out? And this is like noon. And so everybody sees me doing this. Like a jackass, a glock 20 plastic plastic gun. Why don't you hit her fucking window? Fucking thinking.

Speaker 2:          01:56:19       So instinctually, luckily I reload right and he takes off. We run back into the car and we're not going anywhere. I'm like, cream? What the fuck? Let's go. And he's like, I can't find the keys. I can't find a king. Know. So he gets the key. We take off, we go down the road. What kind of car do you drive? It was a, it was a crown Vic at the time. Okay. Shitbox we cops love graphics. Yeah, but there's 58 in them. Dude. Big fucking goofy car, Shitty, shitty. His front wheel drive Taurus's and shit. They tried to give us fuck no drop. We go down the road, the guy makes a turn, we lose him. But we kind of know his area where he is and I see a guy that's running, he had a blue Bandana on, he was black guy, white t shirt.

Speaker 2:          01:57:03       So I see a guy going down the alley, blue Bandana, white t shirt like fuck cream, get out. So he gets out and he's coming from the guy who behind. I circle around with the car and come up and I come around the corner. That guy's looking at me and I'm like, get on the ground. And he starts getting on the ground and I'm looking at him, I'm like, fuck, this is, this is not the same guy. So I'm watching and creams coming up behind him and he's like, come in hard. I'm like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Just as he's getting ready to hit him and he pulls back and just get ready to slam it to the ground, like this is not him. So we leave him go, we run it and we, we actually find the car.

Speaker 2:          01:57:38       So the guy bowed out and he'd left his cell phone in the car. So we picked up the cell phone and we called the most recent number and a girl answered and we were like, Hey, oh, I'm so and so. I found this phone on the side of the road. Do you know what belongs to, I tried to get it back to [inaudible] and she's like, oh yeah, that's so and so for him up in the, in the computer. And that was who had the car. So he, oh my God, I'd be so mad at her. I be like, what the fuck did you tell him? Oh my God, you told my fucking name. All my God in the report and everything. Oh that's hilarious. Did you get the Guy? If somebody else did, so we had the warrant. Somebody else ended up catching him. That's hilarious.

Speaker 2:          01:58:14       That was your first car check? First car chase. Why don't they give you guys like mustangs or something fast? Ooh, I think that'd be a bad idea. Why not? Very responsible. Is that what it is? The law. We're not trained to drive like that. Uh, the law, wait a minute, hold the fuck on. They don't train you how to drive. Not Highspeed. No, no. They let you drive high speed chases. They know you're breaking the rules to do a high speed chase in Baltimore, you can't do more than 10 miles an hour was in Maryland. You

Speaker 3:          01:58:42       can't do 10 more than 10 miles an hour over the speed limit according to the rules. So the law says you can do it, but the rules of the agency say you can only do 10 miles an hour over. So every cop that pulls you over and you're doing more than 10 miles per hour over the speed limit, he had the violate general orders even pull you over was the rules. I didn't make them. Okay. So the department lets you do high speed chases. They don't like it. No. But so who lets you do it some, you said you do it so somebody tells you no. Okay. But they don't, no one teaches you how to drive. We go to a course and they kind of do it, but the standards are incredibly low and you don't go very fast. So the standards for driving, are they more or less stringent than the standards for self defense?

Speaker 3:          01:59:26       I don't think there's a standard in either. Um, so that is so fucking crazy. Right? If you, if you couldn't defend yourself going in, you're not going to have to defend yourself coming out. If you couldn't drive going in, you're not going to drive coming out. If you couldn't shoot going in, you're not going to shoot coming out when the scariest things is is cops ability to fire a weapon. They're terrible. They're terrible. So I would estimate that may have to be accurate or anything. No, no, it's, it's, it's absurd. Like they can't shoot. So like when you hear somebody like, why didn't you shoot him in the knee for one, you, you can't do that. That's, that's a silly idea. But why can't you? Okay. So if I'm shooting for what I'm shooting at Uni, I'm shooting down so I'm liable to ricochet. I cause I'm gonna miss it.

Speaker 3:          02:00:09       You're going to be a moving target. You know how hard it is to shoot an animal. So imagine shooting a human in such a tiny area that's trying to shoot with a handgun. Right? You can't do it. It's, it's a silly idea. That's why you shoot sooner. Center mass people criticize that, but it's really the only practical way to do it. But she used to shoot animals to get, very rarely shoot it out. Imagine that even if he was standing there and as we tried to take out a knee cap of a boar sitting there, that's, that's ridiculous. So, so hopefully one day we can all dispel that rumor about shooting a weapon at somebody. I'd be like, why didn't you shoot the knife out of his hand? Like, are you kidding me? That's hilarious. But they don't shoot, they couldn't shoot a person, let alone a neat, right.

Speaker 3:          02:00:51       Like we, the standard, a minimum score is like a 70 and it's a silhouette target. Like I minimum score meaning 70% 70% or when a silhouette you're, no. Okay. So you go to hit the wholesale away from the three to the five to the seventh to the 15th I can shoot that whole course of the 15 with my eyes closed and pass it. Right. 15 yards. Is it? That is so 15 yards with a handgun hitting center mass on a tar. All you have to do is just hit the target. You can pass the course by doing everything from the three to five and I think the seven it could be running is this target. It's a human silhouette. So I mean it's a full silhouette for of the toast. So you're dealing with like a two and a half foot, three foot target. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          02:01:33       That's almost impossible to miss. And all you have to do is get 70% and you pass. Yeah. So you miss 30% at 15 yards a giant fucking targets. We're not even talking about 15 yards. We're talking about, I mean some of these from three, wait a minute. You start from the three, you do a lot of random, they get set. Hold the fuck on 70% right? So you can actually qualify before you even shoot any person I know. So this isn't even adrenaline. There's not even grazes ideal situation, ideal circumstances. So that's all it should be. 100% I know a hundred or they kill you. They should kill you from it. Take you a bag. Yeah, a hundred very good. A different tribe. I've had 98 from time to time. They shouldn't be there. It's staggering. People don't understand what we're talking about when you say the job is impossible, it is completely impossible.

Speaker 3:          02:02:25       Especially with the amount of training that they have. Oh my God, I don't understand how they don't train you how to do that. They don't train you how to firearm use firearms correctly. No. Nobody. Accuracy treating you how to breathe while you're shooting. They tell you all these things, but they don't have time. So the instructors, they know what they're doing, right? They don't have time to, to take somebody that has no idea what the hell they're doing or what's even worse. And somebody has bad habits and break those habits so they can be a decent shooter. It's, it's, it's, there's no time for it and it's not gonna happen. There's those standards. So if they don't pass, they just keep shooting them and shooting and shooting and shooting till you pass. So you just keep, keep doing it or you learn learning to learn and you only do it once a year. What, what the fuck are you talking about? No practice once he oh no. Yes. Oh my God. Right. That's why I'm saying I couldn't do this job without the Marine Corps. So the only reason I'm, I was any good that from the record. How many guys were in the service that you worked with? Um, uh, maybe 20% so 80% have no experience hit the broad side of a barn. Oh my God.

Speaker 3:          02:03:43       So these people are in this situation where they had these expectations and that's why they feel so cornered. So they're actually feeling like they're being somebody who's judging them and it's not so much that they're judging them. They're judging the, the ineptitude to do the job. It's a will Ferrell movie. You could do it. I mean that's what it feels like cops say about the banter. I mean that's really, it's, it seems that way a lot. God Damn it. I can't believe that. Well why don't I know that. I should have known that. I got to get John McCarthy on. He's the next cast, you know big John McCarthy. He's got, I got to get him on soon. He got to tell him he's got some great stories about pulling over Eddie Murphy. I don't know. I'm an Eddie Murphy Fan. I will only speak with him about him with respect and Charlie Murphy anyway, so no self defense training. What is there is just

Speaker 4:          02:04:37       pointless. You don't have to have like a certain degree of proficiency in hand to hand combat. No, they do like, I like wrist locks and carries this one, stuff like that. But this slot, these are things that, you know, in a real scenario we can't do. So you gotta be a bad motherfucker. Yeah. You can do drill and put me to the ground with my wrist. But in real life, you'll never get in my wrist. Yeah. It's just not going to happen. If I'm fighting for my life where I'm trying to get away, it's just not gonna happen. So the things we do just are impractical. Well, Steven Seagal could get you to the ground. Yeah. Have you ever seen him seen as trying to get to see the most recent one in Russia? I'm afraid so I flipped a bunch of people around. I'm sure his hair didn't move.

Speaker 4:          02:05:19       One serious hair helmet he's got, he's still nicely overweight. Oh yeah. He's beautiful. Beautiful fucking machine. Can hand combat. Watch this, take a look at this. I like to do rag sweat, that sweet. Do Rag, look at this. See this is what you guys need to learn this kind of shit. Can you do that? This is the kind of stuff they do and they don't factor in the fact that they're suspect is going to hook you in the face with that empty left hand, but wait a minute, look how this guy can't do anything. I know. It's amazing. It's almost like learned this, this before to be the victim in this situation. You can't. No Man. I'm telling you, you got to get Steven Seagal. Teach everybody because look at the way he just throws everybody around. They have no chance. Look, he doesn't even move. Dude.

Speaker 4:          02:06:06       Learn this. Why can't you just have empathy? Isn't he a cop? I thought he was too like a voluntary one. No, he was a real cop. I remember in Louisiana every, he was talking like he was black. If you keep talking about this, somebody, I think he's transformational. I think he's Trans Racial. Did you ever hear him talk? You're saying this now, but then there's going to be some agency that does that and thought it was a good idea. It's all your fault. Should look at this. This is beautiful. If you could do this, you could kick everyone's ass. They don't even let them in the UFC because he's too deadly. We've had discussions behind closed door meetings whether or not we should allow Steven Seagal a fight and everyone says no, he's too deadly to take her out and they need him for that is too small.

Speaker 4:          02:06:44       I'd in a different weight class became Velasquez would be fucked. Junior dos Santos. What's you gonna do to that? Huh? What are you going to do with Fabrizio for doom? Steven Seagal gets a hold of your wrist. Huh? I haven't heard you tax wrists. That's a very vulnerable spot and I'll out like pull your hands on. Isn't Joe Rogan doing it? Why don't I have fire? Why don't you teach? No, why don't you teach the cops? Well, I don't think I'm qualified because I've never been in armed situation with people shooting guns. I've never learned how to disarm anybody in hand. We don't need to arm. We don't do this. I could, you know, I copied my opinions about some shit, but you should bring in legit striking coaches that teach people all the time and then legit Jujitsu coach Jujitsu. It would be, or your route because it's more about control than depends.

Speaker 4:          02:07:32       Hurting. Well, yes, but no. Sometimes you get to hit people, like there's sometimes the idea of only defending yourself by grappling. I think mixed martial arts is the best way to learn self defense. And uh, I mean, I'm essentially a mixed martial artists. I started out as a striker and then when I got older, when I got into the UFC, that's when I really learned grappling. But, uh, I think if I had to choose one martial art that I would teach someone to defend themselves, it would definitely be Jujitsu. But as far as what I would teach police officers, you got to understand striking because if you don't understand striking and a guy who can keep you off him and punch him in the face and you don't know how to deal with it, you got to understand the way he's moving. Like if a guy, if a guy is going to jab you, there's a certain stance.

Speaker 4:          02:08:15       If a guy's going to throw a right hand, there's tells. If you don't know, those tells you. Just going to get Molly whopped. You're just going to get cracked. I think you have to understand at least understand striking and the only way to understand striking is this bar. You have to do some sparring. You have to, you have to definitely learn the mechanics of striking, but you also have to understand the distance. You have to understand how when a guy can hit you, when he can hit you, even if it's just defensive, even if you don't have any intention whatsoever hitting somebody, just knowing how to get the fuck out of the way, knowing how to cover yourself up, knowing how to protect herself. There's a lot of people out there that are grapplers that we'd be fucked if someone punched him in the face.

Speaker 3:          02:08:54       No, I think you're onto something with that actually like a the defensive method. We're not going to really teach cops to strike that. You're just not going to get anywhere. Best way you're, you're, you're right to the, like the, the getaway. You might actually be on to something there that that could be that that's something we should probably should be doing because what we do is we fear things, so remember we fear that that guy can hit us. We fear that should have an understanding of whether he or she would actually be capable at that range are capable. In this particular situation.

Speaker 4:          02:09:20       Judo is good for cops to because people most of the time are wearing clothes and like if you've ever fought Ronnie Ronda Rousey and you were wearing a fucking like a, like a winter coat, that bitch would fuck you up. You're going flying. You landed on your head, Carl Prezi and gets a hold of you and you got like a leather jacket on. That mother is going to throw you and hit you with the earth. That's what it's like when someone slammed you. They're taking the earth and hitting you with it. Boom. They're hitting you with a giant and mobile fucking 24,000 mile and assert circumference ball. That's what they're doing it the earth doesn't give. Someone slams you in the concrete. They literally hitting you with the earth. And I think of a judo person gets a hold of you. Some Jimmy Pedro character gets a hold of you and you have a winter jacket on, you're a fuck Ceville you know, that's uh, I think Judah would be a very important thing to learn wrestling.

Speaker 4:          02:10:16       Very important to learn to because if you could hold someone down and it keeps coming down and you can control someone, cause I've seen situations where cops get flipped and they're holding someone down in some sort of a, an arrest video and they just have no idea how to control someone's body. They have no idea where to place their weight. They have no idea like how a person would move. Like it good Jujitsu guy gets a hold of you and puts you inside control. You don't have any Jujitsu training, you're not getting up. This is it. You're stuck. I mean you might be like really physically strong. You might be able to push them a little bit, but he's going to grab a hold of you again and repeat the process. And that's what we saw in UFC one when hoists Gracie was fighting chemo.

Speaker 4:          02:10:53       What do we see? We saw this fucking enormous steroid it up, dude. It's way stronger than hoists Gracie and he just chaos. But eventually always got them. And why did he get him? Got Him. Cause he understands the technique and you understand how to grapple. I think that from one, if you only had one, I would say Brazilian Jiu Jitsu. But if I was gonna teach something to comps, I would definitely teach them striking. The last thing you want to do is be someone who doesn't know how to strike and you get punched in the face and you're, you're seeing stars, you're eyes are watery, your legs are buckled and you don't know what the fuck to do. Cause he never been there before. Somebody knows what to do. Someone who's been there before has been popped in the face before you got to go. Oh, all right, got to keep my hands up.

Speaker 4:          02:11:29       Gotta move. Gotta move gotta move. You know, you'll instinctively have like a path that you'll go to to preserve yourself. The, the scariest thing in the world is watching someone in a street fight and you know, they don't know how to fight and they just, their, their neck is up in the air and they're flailing fists and you know, it's coming, you know, you know it's coming and we've all seen videos. You can go online and watch. Guy Gets Kod and street fight and there's a million videos of that. I just can't believe that they don't force you guys to train first of all in firearms on a regular base. I would always thought that'd be a weekly thing. I really thought that there was like a weekly thing that you guys had to do the physical standards as well. Yeah, I've seen a lot faster because there's not a physical standard whatsoever. Well how about chicks? Oh, have standards. They don't have to have a, the, you don't have to at least be able to like lift their body weight or something or do a chin up or something like that. You get through the academy and you're finished. What do you have to do to get through the academy or whatever. It is.

Speaker 2:          02:12:22       Pathetic and easy. That seems weird. It is weird. Uh, and in Baltimore they had an issue with a fire cadet who ended up dying and training because they, they just didn't maintain the physical standards they needed to make.

Speaker 4:          02:12:38       Now why is that? Is it hard to get people to join the police force? So you have to lower the physical standards.

Speaker 2:          02:12:45       One reason why the job was impossible there. Society doesn't seem to be willing. Okay. So at this point in time, not to sound too arrogant. Too late. Too late. Okay. So it's amaze. Well, go for it. I would be the prototype. Okay. I have a master's degree. I'm confident I came from the, from the military. Uh, if you go through my training record, you'll see it. It's all there. I would be the prototype. I'm what you're looking for, but I still, you're not willing to pay me what it would take to get somebody like me normally to do it. So, so if you, right now, if I went to a police department, they would be offering me $42,000 a year. Really? I mean, you don't think I'm going to take away 2000 a year job to you at this point in time. It's not going to happen. So, so they're not

Speaker 3:          02:13:32       investing in those officers. I really think in a, in most areas where like a Baltimore, you have 3000 officers, I really think you could do the job with a thousand. So, so you would pay those guys, get those guys and you'd get the guys with the education and girls and have those standards. And I really think that one really, really good cop can do the job of the four or five of what we have now, how much harder is it to be a woman and be a cop? Incredibly hard. Imagine, be really hard to get people. Some of them are so freaking good though. Um, so that's the weird line. You tow. They do seem to make better detectives. Um, as a general rule, they have an advantage and a lot of things. I think they're more empathetic, which is one of my big pushes. They're, they're, they're more considerate of others when it, when it comes to a lot and it's harder for them with fighting.

Speaker 3:          02:14:24       But I've seen some of them hold their own just fine. And the hardest one was actually a flamboyantly gay cop than I know he had the hardest time and I loved that guy. Flamboyantly gay cop. I love him so much. He Gay. Was he very, he's the queen and so he referred to, he calls himself the claim is the queen of the northern. That's beautiful. That's what we need to stop fucking army of roided up gay cops and he's, he would fight all the time. If you could go to battle with that dude any day and you could trust that he would have your back, you could follow him day and night. Cause he was tried constantly and he became, he was always good. Love that dude. Awesome cop to work with. But he was, he constantly lived in a different world than I did.

Speaker 3:          02:15:07       I was maybe I fell into that medium frame where like I'm not too big to try and I'm not too small to try. So I kind of got away with a lot because she was tried all the time because he's flamboyantly gay. Yeah. So did he be like license and registration? He was, he has the voice, so he really say that when he pulled people over and stuff. Oh yeah. Well you going and he had a purse for a while. Let me think about, think about that though. I love it because you do it, but that's true. I actually don't know. I don't know. Maybe cause you gave it to me. I think I do, but I thought about that. The airport, like you say, it's like if it would be so much easier that people are just scared of not getting laid, that's why they don't have it. They're scared of the fashion stigma attached to it. It's bullshit. It's what it is. I wear one of those mother fuckers everywhere and then meet me and they go, dude, you really wearing a fanny pack. I'm like, that's right bitch. That shit's real as fuck.

Speaker 3:          02:16:08       Why is that? Why is that a problem? But if I wear a backpack, I'm saying it's that same confidence that you have with the confidence that he has. Cause I'm married, I'm not trying to get laid. It was admirable. If I was struggling to try to get laid, I was like, man, it was window and hit her mess. I was just had to be dressed perfectly. You know? That's what I do to wear Cologne and shit like that. And designer shoes. Why? Cause they fucking trying to tip the scales in their favor.

Speaker 4:          02:16:30       They're not confident in their personality and their accomplishments and how they come off as, as a human being. They've got to get to wear the right clothes and the right style and that fanny pack and fucking sick your battle. Chet dammit. I had her, she could have been the one that married, had kids. I was that fucking stupid panty fanny pack. I fucked my chances. I don't know if that's why. I think you've got enough game. You can do it with a fanny pack. That's what I think. I think if a girl doesn't want to have sex with you, it doesn't want to date you because you have a fanny pack. You don't want her in your life. She's too much work. That's too much work. Or you don't know how to make fun of yourself. You can't even mock the fact that you were in a fanny pack and then explain yourself can make a good show. And she's like, why are you wearing a fanny pack? Stupid. You're like, exactly.

Speaker 3:          02:17:15       Anyway, he wore a purse. Yeah, he keep this kind of purse goes it like glittery or anything. He had it. It would have been stylish. It wasn't, it wasn't no chump shit. So, um, what, what was it like for him? I mean I think it was incredibly challenging for him. Like they wouldn't let him arrest him. Like they would fight like, like no way. I understand I'm going to jail but not from him. Is He still on a job? Yeah, he's awesome. Too. Good for him. What's his name? I don't know. Just give his full name. His first name. No, no. I just want to give a shout out to him. You can call que que you keep it sexy, keep it sexy queue. So harder for him than women. Yeah, I think so. I think it's incredibly hard for him. And she was saying that women make better

Speaker 4:          02:18:10       detectives. What, what else besides empathy? Do they have like intuition? It's

Speaker 3:          02:18:15       better. I mean I can't say but they s they do seem to fulfill those roles very well. Hmm. Yeah. So there's a role for females in policing. Even if you're thinking of the physical aspects, uh, there, there is a like a need. Right? So how you balance that? I can't say that it required a little more nuance, but definitely have a role. Is there anything else you want to say before we get out of here? Cause I know you've got a bunch of notes there. It's just that one of the big things that we see is everybody keeps fighting against the black lives matter thing. And it's like we're not understanding what it is. It's not that we come out with things all lives matters. Might wear a shirt all lives matter. No, no shit. We understand all lives matter. That's the whole point of everything we do.

Speaker 3:          02:19:02       And they come out and they say police lives matter. No Shit. I don't know a life that's mattered more than a police life. I don't know of a single cop has been killed or the killer wasn't called, which is embarrassing for our profession. Why do we always catch the ones that hurt our own? Hmm. Maybe we're not trying hard enough. And the other ones, and we go around and we say these things, but the police, everyone comes to their aid when something happens to them. But when we, somebody says black lives matter, we just, Oh, oh,

Speaker 2:          02:19:28       oh. But what they're, it's all they're saying is, is that in our society, black lives haven't mattered as much as the other lives. And that's clear. When you see something like Tamir Rice, because you know that doesn't happen then one of your kids, there's not a shot in hell that that happens to my daughter or yours. No Way. Whether there are 12 year olds sit with a BB gun in the middle of your street in front of your house. That is not going to happen because they're going to say, oh well no you don't. We're going to handle that situation. We're going to approach her. We're going to see what's really going on. And they're not going to be a hero because a hero is the person that goes up to Tamir rice and approaches and tries to figure it out, risk getting shot because he wants to make sure he's doing the right thing.

Speaker 2:          02:20:08       When you take away a life or take away somebody's freedom, you don't even have to go up to them. How about you just say from the comfort of the car, put down the gun. Sure, sure. From far away, you know, figure it out because w but we go and we, we, we treat black lives like they don't matter. And when you were putting that, oh yeah, all lives matter shirt on or oh yeah, police lives matter on your proving that police lives don't, that, that black lives aren't mattering as much to you. Otherwise you would just fucking say, yes they do. Right. So they're not saying that white lives don't matter. Let matter. Bring it up, bring it up to everyone else. That's it. Just a quality. It's not, it's not a dis on anybody else. It's we have this problem and we have this problem.

Speaker 2:          02:20:50       Recognize it, let's fix it. That's when I say that I want to team up with the ray. So if I took a uh, police commissioner job, the first thing I would do is say, Deray, please come join me please because I need you. I need him. He's a community leader. The idea that we don't integrate people like him into our system is ridiculousness. He is a leader of the black community. I need him. If I'm going to run a police agency and we should not be turning those kinds of people away and acts and making like there, there was some kind of instigators from Abbott town is what they would call the instigator. That's what they call them out of town, instigator that he was coming to Baltimore and he's making money and he's doing all this and it's not an equal one and he's doing, they think he's making money doing all this and he's simply not.

Speaker 2:          02:21:38       Neither am I. I mean we came out here on our own arm dime with the help of, well you know who's making money? That's how sharp and CNN and Fox News, anybody broadcasting it where they're going to get advertising dollars and that's something that's going to get a lot of people watching certainly is our ratings went up. I went down to where Freddie gray was, the incident happened and where the uprising was the very next day. You couldn't have told me that there was a difference between that day and two weeks ago. The problem is that no one gave a shit about Gilmore homes two weeks ago, but when it comes on the news and you saw the cvs burning and they cycled it over and over and over again, it was one God damn building that was burning. You just kept seeing it over and over after the fire department had already put it out. Violence in violence in Baltimore, the riots and all of these tapes, that fucking news

Speaker 3:          02:22:26       voice, you're your own and exactly. And we do that and then we look at that community and we're like, oh my God, why would they do that? Well, nothing ever happens without it. Without an uprising. What ever great civil rights movement or great progress if we ever made without some kind of uprising. How about the United States of America? Yeah. This came about because we got away from the fucking British. I mean that's literally how this got started. It was an uprising. Boston tea party. It's a goddamn uprising. And is anybody sit there and say, oh my God, why did they just throw their own tea in to the water? That's ridiculousness. But they don't hesitate to say, why are they burning that cvs down? Well that's the only symbolism of corporate America that they even have their, cause they don't have a grocery store like you and I do.

Speaker 3:          02:23:11       They don't have anything that we think of as as as normality. They live in a, in an area that has food deserts, that doesn't have good schools, where the kids ride MTA buses to go to school where the life is and, and their, their parents get, their father gets locked up because he has that dime bag and he perpetuates a cycle, but yet society keeps telling them or we'll pick yourself up by your bootstraps and I'm fucking have bootstraps because you took them away by your boobs. Judge is such a shitty argument. It's not like everybody starts in the same spot. You know? It's not like we're all playing monopoly and we all start from the same spot. It's stupid. That's such a terrible, terrible mentality that people have and it's so short sided and so dismissive. Pull yourself up by your bootstraps. It's just so dumb.

Speaker 3:          02:23:56       It's such a short, and that's a short sided conservative argument that is a conservative argument. It's just such a dumb one. Well, the last thing I wanted to say too is that conservatives and right wing people are the ones that are going to argue with me the most. If we don't do what I'm saying, then they're going to lose their guns and their argument that they want to have. Because if we can't reel in police and they're always afraid that everyone has a gun and we have to do this war, then that means we can't live in a society that's armed and we can't police it properly. You just said that a bunch of people just look, Bro, what the fuck lose my guns? Right? What'd you say? Sorry. Should take my flag. You're taking my fucking gun. Not, nope. If you want to keep your guns, Charlton Heston said, yeah, you can pry my cold dead hands from it if you want.

Speaker 3:          02:24:51       Well, if you want to keep your guns, then we need to have reform in policing. I don't like this kind of language because people are going to keep their guns. They're keeping the fucking gun unless reform policing. I think that's a great idea. I don't think you need to bring guns into this. You know, guns and do anything to anybody. What did the cops can on people. People. People are doing it. People kill people. People are killing people. Guns are just sitting there looking beautiful. How many gun deaths happened in England? Ah, fucking English. Bunch of pussies. Scared to pull the trigger. So the argument though, it has a funny

Speaker 1:          02:25:24       imagine. We turns out they all had guns. I can't quite do it. I was thinking about shooting just doesn't seem Brian who's Robert Wright wouldn't be proper. Yeah, no, I, uh, listen, I think you're saying some awesome things. We do have to wrap this up, but uh, I really, really appreciate you coming on and I think you, uh, you express yourself very well and uh, I think that you're, you're a very unique person.
