Speaker 1:          00:00:01       And we're live, so it was nice to take a break, man. Taking a break from anything is a good move. It's really is. Take just a few days off the podcast. Get all excited to come back and do it. Yeah. Little refresher. A little refresher. So, um, what's up brother? How are you? Good to see you. I'm good man. We going on there. Oh, this is my shirt that uh, talks about how George Washington was alive today. They throw him in jail because he was smoking weed and murdering. Yeah. He, he grew pot, right? Yeah. And he was pretty open about it. He talked about how they should sow that seed everywhere. It's like, it's amazing. It's a miracle plant. Makes me feel good. It's good for good for clothes. Could paper. Did they smoke it though? Did the founding fathers smoke it? You know, there's not like a lot of direct reports.

Speaker 1:          00:00:45       I don't think about them actually smoking it, but if they hadn't figured that out, they're pretty savvy. I think they got that down. I wondered though, because if you were like growing something and you were using it for one thing, like say if you were growing Kale and you were eating it, you wouldn't be like, let's smoke this shit. Like live your whole life and not know the Kale could get you to God's front door. You don't think that smell though, you know, they're just like, miss that smell, this herb. They would have eaten it. Have made a tea out of it. They would have done something isn't it? Doesn't have to be cooked though. In order to be psychoactive. I'm the worst pothead ever. I should know this. I'm like such a pot advocate. I should know. Like if you're going to get in trouble and you eat a bunch of your pot, do you get high up?

Speaker 1:          00:01:31       I don't really. I'm pretty sure you don't. Wow. Yeah. I think that's one of the reasons why people really enjoy a juice pot. Apparently the health benefits of juicing pot, of taking the fresh non dried leaves and doing it like wheat grass juice is incredible. It's supposed to be really good for you. I believe that. Yeah. Yeah, and it smell. It doesn't smell like something you want to eat, you know, like if you smell pot it's like it's aromatic. It's a beautiful plant. A flag of tea. Yeah. That was out in the wild data probably. Fuck you up. I think it's a fat issue though. That's why they always do it with butter, you know? I think it's a or the oils I should know. Goddammit. Well we got it. People get so mad when you don't know things. Pothead Carter's going to get revoked.

Speaker 1:          00:02:19       Research. Well, I definitely know it can get you high. I'll vouch for that. But no, I don't think. I just still think eating it raw can. But um, um, people get so pissed off if you were wrong about anything in these long rambling shit. Talking sessions. No vetting of information. Two thousand 16 man. Enough. Enough of your misinformation and I don't know, I don't know if it but it does it. It is amazing though that all these guys used it for so many different things and somehow along the line, just a couple hundred years later, it became demonized and got people locked up in jail. Very Declaration of independence written on the plant that got made illegal and one of the drafts, yeah, one of the drafts is written on hemp paper and papers the best. Have you ever had him paper before? Now it's insanely durable. It's really weird.

Speaker 1:          00:03:13       It's such a weird plant. There's a weird thing about marijuana is have you ever held a stock a marijuana tree stock? Now it's incredible because it feels like styrofoam in in, in terms of like how light it is, but it's really hard like oak. It's bizarre. It's a fucking alien plant. It really is. If you stop and think about all the things that that one plant provides, it has a full amino acid profile, but almost like a meat only. There's only a few other plants I believe keenwah and a couple others are similar in that they have a full amino acid profile. You can make oil that you could. You could heat your house with it, you could build a house with it with hempcrete. Ever seen that hempcrete stuff, but I've heard my God, they make concrete with hemp and apparently has antimicrobial properties where it makes it really an effective building method and places that have a lot of mold, like high mold content, like high moisture content.

Speaker 1:          00:04:15       It's insanely durable. It apparently will last forever. It's really light. This is hempcrete. This is the shit you make this with. Hemp has massive installation properties. Yeah. Energy efficient. It really is like an alien gift. Yeah, it's crazy. Just went down and said, here you go, humans for so many things. Have you seen all the stuff they're doing with cbd oil and children that have epilepsy? I have been following that closely. Fucking wipes it out. You know, another thing apparently there's really good for children that have epilepsy is going into ketosis. Akita genic diet apparently like high fat, high fat content foods low a low simple carbohydrate foods. Yeah. Apparently has a radical effect on children with epilepsy. It makes sense. You know, I mean a lot of what the brain is brain is mostly made up of fat, you know, and I think a lot of times we don't pay attention to the raw materials that our body's made up of.

Speaker 1:          00:05:15       You know, like your brain is made up of largely fatty content and it's shown in a lot of different studies that fat is good for the brain. So these issues that are coming from the brain, maybe there's an issue with some of the raw material, maybe you just supply it more of what it's made of. Yeah, that's probably. That makes sense. And also what makes sense to me is that that's what people ate for thousands and thousands of years. They just ate plants that grew out of the ground, like normal stuff and meats and fishes and whatever. They could get a fishes the fish and you know, and whatever they could catch and eat. They didn't have spaghetti, you know, they didn't have all this stuff that we fucking love now. Bread bread is awesome.

Speaker 2:          00:05:58       Goddammit. Bread is why is it so bad for you? Well really, I mean there's a lot of people who argue that the bread is only bad for you because of how we prepare it. We allow the heat to dry, which has it developed this heightened layer, this kind of protective layer so that the seed could survive, you know, conditions where it wasn't going directly into the soil, you know, seeds or have evolved to survive. And the way that we prepare it, it's not germinated, sprouted. So that hard layer is what makes it really hard to digest. Or if you get like a sprouted bread, you know, a lot of people say that the health benefits are pretty good and all, and a lot of the negative is mitigated. That's interesting. And that's what I eat most of the time. And he did Zucchini bread, which is a sprouted bread, which, uh, not nearly is delicious now.

Speaker 2:          00:06:43       It's definitely not. Definitely not. The other one that's supposedly good is sour dough bread because sourdough, they use, uh, it's, you know, they have a culture in there that's fermenting, that's what's actually causing it to be sour. And that's partially digesting some of that, uh, the hard parts of the wheat to digest. So it's almost coming to you like pre digest it a little bit by the bacteria that makes it sour. So it's a lot easier on your stomach. Yeah, I'd heard that. Right. Like for even there's some gluten free versions of sourdough bread, [inaudible], which is a apparently even better. I have something I haven't, I haven't done anything with it. There's a lot of. The problem is, is that when your stomach gets inflammation, it doesn't just go locally in your stomach. Then it creates these proinflammatory cytokines which go cross the blood clot in the bloodstream into the blood brain barrier and then you get that Kinda like, foggy, shitty feeling throughout your whole body.

Speaker 2:          00:07:33       You know, I mean, a lot of people talk about it like leaky gut, but when inflammation is there and the gut, it's a lot easier for it to go systemic. And so keeping that, keeping that down to a minimum is really key for, you know, performance. Yeah. Pasta Comas are legit for sure. Fucking real mature. Like, my mom used to make this insane lasagna and you'd eat the Lasagna, you better know how many plans bitch is on using your system. That ricotta. And it was so good though, God dammit. And um, I've had gluten free pasta written recently. I've been getting into that. I wished I'm so glad Joey Diaz isn't here. He'd be screaming fucking gluten, but it doesn't give you the same effect. It's like you get but you don't have that. Oh, like that. A lot of people associate with a good meal and feeling of just being, just sedated. Like, oh, that was great. You know, it's, it's weird how that works until you have to do something. Exactly. It's like, shit, I got work to do or have that big lunch. And you got meetings afterwards and you're just pounding coffee. Just like get it together to death doesn't work. It doesn't really work that well. She is the way to go. Right, for sure. If you're in that situation, you really should be pounding enzymes, digestive enzymes, and even additional if you

Speaker 3:          00:08:56       really have a difficult meal, you know, taking some hydrochloric acid along with the enzymes is going to be great. But enzymes are, are key. You know, it's, it's so fascinating for me that for the longest time when people thought about food and nutrition, they f they thought, well, he eat a healthy balanced diet and you know, that's pretty much it. That's really all you need. If you want to be a sensible person, if you want to really push the fringes like Jacqueline Lane, he used to fucking eat a bucket of pills everyday. Didn't he? Didn't, wasn't Jack Lillian like a crazy supplement taker guy? I wouldn't surprise me. Yeah, I'm pretty sure he was. Um, or uh, another one is a homeboy. The guy wants to live forever. Ray Kurzweil Kurzweil, he explained to me. I interviewed him once for this Scifi show. It was so fucking cool. Just me and Ray Kurzweil chilling in his apartment in San Francisco for like an hour and a half talking about to life and possibilities and all the potential future technologies that are going to extend our life thousands and thousands of years.

Speaker 3:          00:09:59       But that guy, he doesn't fuck around. He takes a gigantic bucket of pills everyday, which I'm not sure is the right way to do it, you know? I don't know. Sure. I don't know. Is it foods? Is it foods and supplements? I think you've got to really just look at what, you know, what you particularly need to know and just targeted for that. You know, I think a lot of things are what you want, you know, a lot of it is just like, what's going to help your performance? What's going to help you reach your goal? Like what is your goal? For him, it's live forever, so he's probably trying a bunch of different things, but he's a little bit frantic about that. He's a little concerned that he's not gonna make it til this technology older than us. He's like 70, 70. But what I was going to get at is that when they started doing grass fed foods, like grass fed beef became all the rage and people start noticing the difference in the actual size of the stakes, like if you get a tenderloin or if you get a New York strip from a grass fed animal, it's like can considerably smaller piece of meat and then the fat looks different.

Speaker 3:          00:10:59       The fat is a yellow fat instead of a white fat. And then when I started getting into hunting, one of the weirder things that I've found was Steven Rinella told me about blueberry bears and that the most delicious meat is these black bears in Alaska and Canada as well. Anywhere they have blueberries, right? When they're getting ready to get into hibernation, they feast on blueberries to the point where their flesh smells like blueberries and they're fat becomes purple. Like it changes your body. And it made me think like, what about fucking twinkies and shit? You know, what about Coca Cola? What is all that doing? Your fat content? What is it doing to your body? You know, like how much of what you are like if you ever smell someone that's like unhealthy, like give her a date and unhealthy girl or your own self when you're sick. Not Me Bro. Good. All the time. Let's.

Speaker 2:          00:11:54       Yeah, that'll, that'll do it. If you, if the smell is. I think that was one of our primal cues. You sniff somebody and say, are you healthy? You know, how's your, how's your gut biome? That's what someone's. But you know, like is that. Yeah, totally. But I think um, you know, now we're in this paradigm where it's not just you are what you eat because that's really true. Your body is made up of the input that you eat 100 percent. That's what makes up your body. And I think we forget about that, but. So we're not only what we eat, but what we're, what we eat eight, you know, so we're what the animals ate because their body's made up of what they ate. And then when you're looking at vegetables, I think sometimes people ignore the fact that the vegetables are drawing these minerals from the soil.

Speaker 2:          00:12:34       So what's the soil like? Is it soil that's been farm forever and they just put a limited array of fertilizer on there just enough to get it to go, well then maybe you're not getting enough minerals because the plants don't have enough minerals. So I think that's scenario that I'm really kind of looking keenly on because the one thing that I've done this year differently is really started supplementing with minerals and that's made a huge difference in my energy levels. What are you doing? I take a fulvic mineral and I take it a couple of different ways. What does that mean? It's a different. It's like fulvic acid. It's a type of compound in the soil that has a really wide array of trace minerals and so you can get it. I'm pretty much from the United States. You can get it from all over the place. It's really like densely concentrated old, old vegetation, you know, that is turning, turning the soil.

Speaker 2:          00:13:21       Um, that. And then Himalayan Sea salt of course is another great resource. But the combination of like intentionally giving those, I feel like I'm giving my body the building blocks to make the body to do what it needs to do. Like all of our clans and skin and organs, it's comprised largely of these elements and minerals and these different things. And I feel like sometimes the body's reaching for spare parts and the garage is empty. It's like Duh, what the hell? I don't have this mineral that I need to repair myself. You know, because it's not part of what osteoporosis is. Yeah. Your body drawing calcium literally from your bones. Yep. And then we do that naturally. Another reason why we don't have that many minerals is we do that naturally when we run a little bit acidic. So for drinking coffee and alcohol and these things are Ph may not change, but the reason it doesn't change is the body uses the minerals from things like the bones, calcium carbonate, which is the traditional antacid, something that buffer the acid.

Speaker 2:          00:14:14       So it buffers the acid within the body by utilizing available minerals. So we get an even a greater mineral depletion if we're running more acidic, which is one of the reasons why I think an alkaline diet is helpful, but you can kind of hack that by just taking a lot more minerals so you have more available to buffer out your acidic diet, not that you should be drinking booze and eating sugar and coffee anyways, but we're all going to do that. We're all humans. So if you're going to do that, getting more minerals in your diet is going to be huge. What do you fuck around with colloidal minerals? We take that stuff into that for awhile and I got some benefits of it, but uh, for whatever reason I stopped drinking them. Yeah. You know, for me it's just fulvic. There's fulvic acid, humic acid.

Speaker 2:          00:14:55       I found that the humic acid a little heavy, it weighs on my digestion, but fulvic acid is a little cleaner. I feel like I absorb it better. So every time I'm making a drink, I get those mountain valley spring waters and my thing is just a little bit of Himalayan salt, maybe two grams and then a little scoop of the fulvic mineral powder and um, and drink that and huge difference and I've given it to a lot of people who have had some energy issues, just things not going quite right and, um, made a huge difference. So that's something I'm really kind of looking at for 2016. Nice.

Speaker 3:          00:15:25       Nice. Um, I'm going to get really in the probiotics is here. Yeah. I had a Rhonda Patrick on the podcast and she was talking to me about these really powerful probiotics. So I'm ordering those this week and I'm going to get started on trying out different probiotics because I'm a regular drinker of that Kombucha, that stuff. GTS, Kombucha. No bullshit. I drank for a day, three to four a day every day. I mean, I'm constantly restocking on that shit and it makes a massive difference, man. Like having good gut biome having good thing. I've been eating a lot of his, um, raw sauerkraut and raw fermented beets. Yeah. Kimchi and fermented plants and foods, when you're doing that, you're. You're literally taking in raw like soldiers told to fight off all the other shit that's going on inside your body. I think that

Speaker 2:          00:16:17       absolutely. The other big key that we all ignore, you know, all of us have taken these courses of antibiotics and there's a recent study that came out that showed it takes up to a year for your gut biome to fully recover from a course of antibiotics, a single course of antibiotics, so you're just basically detonating a nuclear bomb off in your stomach and these, these, this gut flora is responsible for neurotransmitter production and immune system production. All kinds of benefits and it may get even crazier than that because there's some animal studies now where they took the gut biome of a really kind of chill mouse and a really hyper mouse and they switched the gut biomes of both of these mice and their personality characteristics changed. So like a lot of what we are may be related directly to our gut flora. So paying close attention to that I think is that minerals is probably the two most important things you could do.

Speaker 3:          00:17:08       That's a really insane thing when you stop and think about it. It was we, I think we associate ourselves or we try to think of ourselves as being some sort of an independent entity like I may as well. I feel good when I have a cup of coffee and a glass of orange juice. But the idea that you literally are what you've put into your body and that it doesn't just fuel your body, but it makes your body and your body changes and varies dependent upon what you're putting in.

Speaker 2:          00:17:36       Yeah. We're like a trillion organisms actually that just have one over mind so that everything's not just warring with each other and and making it like, I need this, I need. We just have one over mine, but it's really, you know, we're king of a trillion

Speaker 1:          00:17:50       cells and how are we going to be a good ruler to these? They're like our loyal subjects. Like we have a little kingdom in our body and are we going to be a good ruler? Are we going to be a shitty one that just talks shit to him? It gives him shit food and, and you know, taxes the hell out of them. Mass too much. Gives you little. Well we have one voice where it comes out of one hole, but I don't necessarily know. That's like one thing in there that's running the show. That's true because I think we like to think that it is, but God dammit shifts loyalty and direction. It just, it's all over the place. The mind and who you know in quotes you, when you think of yourself as me, you know me when you think when you yourself, well, I'm going to do this or I'm going to do that.

Speaker 1:          00:18:29       I'm like, what are you saying? Like what do you. What are you saying? I'm going to lead the troops, but who are you? You change all the time, motherfucker. You're different whether or not you've had a nap, whether you've had a cup of coffee, whether you're taken your Alpha brain, you're fucking different all the time. Like, cool. You Bitch. You're so inconsistent. Like what's going on in there? Well, what's going on there as you're an ecosystem, you're, you're like, it's like the jungle calling itself a thing. The jungles not authoring the jungle is fucking millions of things all in a cycle where the big ones are eating the little ones and then the big ones die and the little ones absorb it and it's like this constant ever going thing that's happening. The idea of it being like the like a lighter, you know, or like a brick, you know?

Speaker 1:          00:19:13       It's not a fucking giant system of all these and that's the body. Very true. Yeah. I think there's this combination of also the body and then consciousness and the mind like all of these three different things, which I, that's how I kind of organize it. There's the body, then there's the mind, ego, and then there's your consciousness and those are always different voices. The body's more like a plant. It's slow and it doesn't listen to the mind that which moves, like instantly the mind can think one thing and the other thing, but the body has fortunately has a big lag. It's way slower. Otherwise, they'd be getting mixed signals all over the place, so that inherently creates a conflict because the mind moves at the speed of light, but the body moves slow, so we have this built in system where it's a little bit strange like we can want something for the body, but it takes a while.

Speaker 1:          00:20:00       You gotta change the nutrients. You got to do these different things and I think that's a frustration point for people with their bodies because their mind is so fast and that's what they identify with and they want the body to react. But the body slow bodies like a plan. Yeah. Everybody wants that instant fix. You know, like you come off of hard drinking over new years and you look at your gut and you start pinching your fat and you're like, God damn it. I got to change. And then it's hard. Like you wake up and you look at your clock and like, fuck, I don't want to go to the gym. If I go to sleep right now, I could sleep for another hour and a half before I have to go to work or I go to the gym right now and you know what you should do, but your body's like, come on man, but then your brain is like, what are we looking for? We're looking for success. We're looking to improve, we're looking to feel good, get up you fuck. But it's, it's

Speaker 3:          00:20:48       this conflict. Constant conflict of trying to improve and trying to be disciplined and trying to get it all together. And then this fucking self sabotage mechanism that somehow or another, the vast majority of us have.

Speaker 2:          00:21:03       Yeah, the inner bitch bitch. Yes. Yeah. I think one of the most important things, and this is what I've really been focusing on, is having the ability to do what I call mental override, which is just where you just push manually push that go button all the way down and just do something that you know, you don't want to do because we're so good at negotiating and justifying and you know, having these little arguments with ourselves and sometimes you just need that ability to just go, okay, we're doing this. I don't care if you're scared, that's cool. You're going to be all right. Mental override. We're doing this and you can really use that ability to choose, you know, in so many things. You can even choose yourself in a better mood. You know, I've experimented with that like you're in a Shitty, I'm in a shitty mood and like, well maybe you just choose to listen to a song that's not like a shitty mood song and then you choose to. You can jump from Lily Pad to Lily Pad, but you can choose your way out of a lot of different things if you're willing to do that. If you have cultivated that skill to just push the hammer down and say, all right, I'm going to be happier right now.

Speaker 3:          00:22:07       It's that determinism thing that a lot of people fall prey to. It's like all the different circumstances that have happened in your life. All of your own trials and tribulations, successes and failures, all these things lead up to who you are right now and sometimes the momentum of those things is super hard for people to break. It's super hard for if you've always got up in the morning and smoked a cigarette and had a cup of coffee, the one day you get up and you're like, you know what? I gotTa stop doing this. I got to take care of my body. Got To get off the cigarettes. I got to figure out a way to have it, but to to try to cultivate a bunch of different inspirational things to get you over that Hump I think is the way like whether it's people like for me there's a bunch of people that I call upon in my mind in my mind, like when I think of like a incredibly disciplined top.

Speaker 3:          00:23:03       Like there's this guy that about on my podcast before a great guy, Jocko willink. Jocko was fucking savage. Yep. Right. He's the man every morning go to the twitter page. That motherfucker shows a photo of his watch and it'll say 4:45 or 4:30 or 4:15. This fucker is up every day before five slinging lead, just fucking lifting weights and he, he'll show like puddles on the ground after his workouts and then it'll show like the sun coming up and he feels like that gives him an advantage. But in sending those images out there, other people, even people like me that. I mean I don't necessarily have a problem with discipline. I'm a but I don't have the best discipline. Sure. But I mean,

Speaker 1:          00:23:46       but it's pretty, it's pretty good. You know, I'm pretty healthy but I'm still a fuck up on occasion because I'm a comedian at heart. I mean ultimately is that self-indulgent personality that goes, we're doing shots, you know, it's always there, you know, but when you see a guy like that that's out there fucking going for it like that, guys like that, they, they breed like a little spark, you know, you're not even a little spark, like a big spark. So there's a few of those people that I follow, a few people that I know, a few people that have watched their documentaries or a folder their, you know, their workout routines and you just, you just got to cultivate those things. Just sort of like, he cultivate information. You can have a conversation with no data, you can't, you literally have nothing to talk about.

Speaker 1:          00:24:31       If you haven't experienced anything of you haven't taken any information, will that information much like food is fuel for your body, that information is fuel for your mind, for your personality and for the way you view the world. Like your overall projection or interpretation of the world itself is based on how much data you take in, which is one of the reasons why it's so important to surround yourself with good people. No, Duh. I mean people generally move by one of two forces, inspiration or desperation. It's way better to get an get in early on the inspiration tip, wait for desperation. It causing, oh, I had a heart attack. That's why I changed my diet, or Oh, I'm going to die, so now it's time, but if you can move from inspiration, you know you're going to be way, but way better off. But there's something else too, which is just the ethos like you know, and all warrior cultures develop this.

Speaker 1:          00:25:22       The Samurai had the Bushido, the spartans had their ethos and it's something where you just decide something that just doesn't have. There's no room for negotiation anymore. This is not a negotiable item. You don't need inspiration. You don't need desperation because it's no longer on the table for negotiation and I think that's part of that ability to just choose something and create your own ethos. Like maybe your ethos is I don't smoke cigarettes anymore and that is my ethos. It is non negotiable. Like that is part of my code and developing something that's so, so strong that it's not even on the table for negotiation, you know, and I think it's important to use all of those different facets. Like for the spartans it was, you know, never retreat for the Samurai. It was always keep on or you know, whatever their Bushido it was pretty wide code, but you know, and all of those things, there were these just these things that wouldn't break.

Speaker 1:          00:26:16       So when it came time to, you know, take the sword to protect your honor into your own gut. You know, how hard that is. I can't even cut my little finger, cut my finger. You mentioned like sticking a sword, but it was just non negotiable. Like it was so deeply ingrained and so I think all of us should spend time creating our own ethos. Like what is our ethos? And don't get too crazy with it. Like I'm never going to eat sugar. Come on man. I mean, give yourself a little bit of sugar every now and then. Don't make that ethos

Speaker 2:          00:26:44       but create something that's just non negotiable.

Speaker 3:          00:26:46       Well, I think cheat days are really good for the mind. Cheat meals are really good for the mind and that even though it's not good to take in like an entire pizza in one setting, knowing that you allow yourself that possibility every now and then actually relaxes the imagination and relaxes the, the resistance to discipline because I feel, at least me personally, I don't like rules. I don't like. I mean one of the reasons why I became who I am and the path that I chose as far as like what I chose to do in life just because I didn't like people telling me what to do. I didn't like the idea of school. I didn't like them telling me I had to learn this right now for whatever dumb reasons and when you grow up with this idea that confirm conforming is bad and that following orders makes you a robot and a slave.

Speaker 3:          00:27:42       Fuck that man. I'm going to be my own person will be a free spirit. I'm going to put tie dye on fucking hitchhike across the country. Here you have these ideas that the, the sort of patterns that everybody else is following, they're only following them because they've been told to and you don't have to do that, man. It's bullshit. We're all just organisms. We're all just living on this life together. So you kinda get, get into this mindset where you don't want to have any rigidity. You don't want to have any, uh, any hard fast rules, but that's not necessarily empowering to you as an individual. One of the things I'm really fond of saying is that you only appreciate rest when you've earned it. Yeah. Like, I don't appreciate rest unless I've fucking busted my ass and those have worked out hard. Got All my work done, got all my shit, all my. If I have anything that's fucking with me in the back of my head, it, it haunts me. You know, it, it bothers me and I can appreciate relaxation. It does not worth anything anymore. If I come home from doing nothing and I sit down in front of the television, I may enjoy whatever I'm watching. I might enjoy it because it's good information or it's good stimulation, but I'm not going to enjoy that relaxation. I'm not gonna. Enjoy that. That thing and I've earned it.

Speaker 2:          00:28:54       Yeah, I mean you have a natural seeking of your own kind of balance and I think that's what's important is having that compass to say like, alright, I've worked this hard and now it's time to take off and just let the stress go and I think that's an important line of delineation something that I struggle with too because I'll finish a long day at the office and they'll come back and I'll work and I'll be constantly. Even when I'm like with Whitney trying to watch a movie, I'm thinking about what I could be doing instead of just saying, all right man, just take this two hours. Yeah, really rest. You're off. You're off duty man and clock out. And I think that's an important thing to kind of restore and yet again, it's that same thing like taking a break, like allow yourself that opportunity to let the stress go. You know, when you've done the work. But if you're on the other side and you're just not really doing anything, you know,

Speaker 1:          00:29:42       and you're just kind of relaxing and that's starting to create the stress, then you got to go to the other side of the pendulum and kick some serious ass first before you start worrying about the rest. So it's just about like striking that right balance in your life. God, that's so important. The right balance of so God damn important because you don't want to be that fucking psychopath that just burns everything in front of you and just hacks at the land trying to achieve victory because that, unless you're a fighter, I think that if you're competing, if you're fighting like, well, I'm a big fan of saying that if you, if you want to fight, if this is what you want to do, it has to be completely singular pursuit you. You can't. I want to fight. And I also want to open up an organic peach jam business and I know what I mean and I also want to start marathon running and I'm also really involved in this and that and that and this man, if you want to be someone who's doing something so insanely dangerous that it's probably as far as pursuits in sport fighting is probably one of the all time most dangerous things you could possibly do other than like maybe bmx, flying those flips, those guys do have ramps and like ski jumping, like the shit that he does when he's fucking flying down a hill.

Speaker 1:          00:30:59       Like Jesus Christ. Like that's insanely dangerous too. But like a singular pursuit. Yeah, I think you can only do it for a few years. Like maybe at the most 10 or something like that. But I think to, to be like a fade or a million inco in his prime, that motherfucker was probably gone. I mean he was probably in that zone all the time, like Anderson when he was in his prime other than pussy and food. I bet that dude was pretty locked in, you know, in the few recreational activities, video games, what have you, but you need to achieve that state of like high revolution excellence. You almost have to be like unhealthy. Yeah, I mean I talked to a really successful person that I know and he said that he limits himself always two, three things. Like he will not allow himself to focus on anything more than three things and that was kind of interesting for me because I love creating these little different things and working on these different projects.

Speaker 1:          00:31:57       He's like, for me, three things is the maximum and that's what I forceably cut myself off with and I think that's something good to keep in mind. You can only really genuinely work on three things at a time and maybe when you're a fighter that just narrows down even more to just one thing. Right? Because you have those disciplines you're working on, you're working on the grappling, discipline, striking disciplines and maybe those are your three things. Wrestling, striking, not like nuts. That's it. That's all you have time for. If you're going to be the greatest, maybe that's why Thailand so good for those guys. Just you just pay for sex. You just take that off the table. Not even an issue. Yeah. Just go to the massage parlor or whatever you do. Get your joint worked out. Yeah, no doubt. Yeah, I know. I think, um, where

Speaker 3:          00:32:40       everybody's sort of trying to find this zone that makes them feel the best, that makes them feel the most satisfied, the most comfortable, the least crazy, the least disappointed. You just want to find this and everybody's zone is different. Like some people, they don't have this and burning ambition to succeed. They don't have lofty goals, they just want to be happy or they want to pursue whatever are in they enjoyed doing. Maybe it's maybe like painting or something like that. They just enjoy creating painting, you know, creating a piece of art that someone's going to look at and it looks kind of cool. I think that's really important to not take what societies when is and make it your own. You have your very own wind and that could be chilling at the beach surfing and occasionally painting and that's your win and if somebody else is trying to tell you, oh, you got to do something with your life, fuck that.

Speaker 3:          00:33:31       That's just a counter force, like if you really track what your mission is and what you love to do, then do that thing you know and don't let these other things tell you that you're not succeeding or try and make you conform to what society says is success because that's a bunch of bullshit. We each have our own version of that and I think it's the most important thing we can do to stay true to that, but it does seem to me that everybody needs something. We were like, sure, whatever those things are. These interests that people have, they seem to be like vehicles for happiness, like the mind almost from being developed at the time we were monkeys to what we are now. The mind has gone through all these different activities and has gone through all these trials and tribulations and the struggles for survival.

Speaker 3:          00:34:16       So there's almost like this built in mechanism in the mind to problem solve and to deal with things and either to create like for a lot of people that's a big one or to achieve or to accomplish or to get over the hump and when you're not fighting for your life and you're not struggling, those, those don't get fed and these sort of genetically ingrained reward systems, they seem to be like built into the system of being a person they don't get addressed. And I think that's one of the reasons why a lot of people feel lost. They feel they feel like depressed and unsatisfied because what they're choosing to pursue is not really interesting to them. Like there was a threat on my message board where someone was, uh, it was, it became like a big crazy fucking argument, like all threads and all message boards do.

Speaker 3:          00:35:03       But it started off interesting where someone was saying that hard work stupid and that really what you want to do is find something you love and then disciplines no longer required because you're truly enjoy it. Which is sort of true. But sort of not, because if you really want to achieve excellence, you need both. You need to find something you really love doing and then you need to figure out how to discipline yourself to pursue it to the utmost so that you, you hone that blade and sharpen it to it's razor edge. And if you do not do that, then you're always going to have this thing like, oh man, I could have been better. We need resistance.

Speaker 1:          00:35:38       You know, we need resistance in our life. Like the obstacle is, is what we should go towards. No matter what that is, whether we're writing, you know, writing itself contains its own resistance points where it's hard and you're pushing against that. Obviously in weight training or athletics, it becomes really obvious what that resistance point is. You know, you're actually moving weight or trying to defeat a person. But no matter what that is like applying our force, the force that is the totality of ourselves against a resisting force and overcoming. I think that's a fundamental craving of the human nature. Like that is definitely a key to happiness. Whether it's against nature, against yourself, against a craft, against another opponent, against whatever else. Like that dynamic, that push poll is super key. Yeah, it really is. And I think unfortunately for whatever reason, when I, at least when I look at life itself, I almost think that the evil of the, it seems like this, the struggle of the world, whether it's a struggle for peace, whether it's a struggle for, you know, to alleviate people that are trapped in poverty, whatever, whatever struggle there is.

Speaker 1:          00:36:50       It seems like those struggles are almost, it's almost imperative to have some sort of a struggle in order for people to find balance and, and to find inspiration to do better and inspiration to, to push further. Like I wonder where society would be. This is kind of sound fucked up, but where would we be as a culture if it wasn't for the horrors of war and crime? Like where would we be? I got, as I was driving here today, I was thinking about, um, um, just how fortunate people are in the United States in general are most people are at least, but that there's parts of the world right now that are in these horrific, almost mad max states like Liberia. I've watched this one documentary on a vice on Liberia that back in the day that just cemented in my mind how fortunate we are because mad max like the apocalypse, it exists, it happens every day.

Speaker 1:          00:37:51       Just doesn't happen right here. Knowing that that exists, does that make you appreciate this more? And if, if that didn't exist, would we, would we try as hard as we do to try to keep peace in the world? Would we try as hard as we do to like try to be happy and achieve happiness if we didn't know that there was some ultimate horrible sadness and evil shit going on? Would you appreciate the cool people in your life if you didn't know that there was just an army of content out there? You know? Yeah. That's an interesting topic. I kind of tend to believe that there's enough internal resistance that will battle enough of our own demons. I mean look at how you celebrities

Speaker 2:          00:38:36       and really wealthy people, their rate of happiness is no better than anybody else because even when you alleviate all of these conditions, you're battling these internal demons, like will always find resistance points. So I think we would be okay because it's just the way the system is built, they would come up internally when everything is right and then we have to apply that same force to fight that enemy within our own demons within rather than having this clear objective outside. But it's, it's almost easier and it's almost like it has a certain allure to make an enemy external. Because then like imagine, you know, think back to when the twin towers got bombed. Everybody pulled together with this common enemy. We all had a mission, you know, and everything made sense and that was a really good external, you know, external way to focus our mission.

Speaker 2:          00:39:23       But when it gets internal, that's where we just don't have as many skills. And that's where the tools, like the plant medicines and like meditation and like floating or the tools you need to navigate and kind of conquer those waters. It's not guns and it's not bombs anymore, it's these other more subtle mechanisms which were not nearly as advanced as we are with the stuff that blows stuff up. So I think it would just go from these external battles which have always had this great allure. Let's go to war, you know, into these internal battles, which are really actually a lot of times even harder. I mean, not to say that these conditions in war aren't incredibly challenging and incredibly difficult. I mean, I've heard stories from Tim Kennedy and all kinds of soldiers and just blow your mind, but these internal battles can be super fucking intense too.

Speaker 3:          00:40:09       Yeah. We just don't think of it as being intense because there's no life or death consequences. The consequences are there are psychological there. The reality of who you are as opposed to this image that you're projecting, the reality to seeing all the sort of failures and, and all the different, um, um, sort of mechanisms that you've created in your mind, in your, in your life to deal with all these personality issues that you might not have ever addressed. And then when you take a psychedelic and you're confronted by this, like Ari was telling me about one of his friends that was a dick and they took him out to, well, you know, already does that true and fest every year it took him out to the desert and he just had this literal come to Jesus moment where it was like, why do I act like that?

Speaker 3:          00:41:01       Like, what is wrong with me? Like, what, what is the. And then he realized he's just unhappy with his life in his state. Wake up where he is as far as his achievements as a standup comedian. And as a, you know, like he's not successful. At least he, you know, he's always struggling with his bills. And because of that, um, he's nervous all the time. So when he goes on stage, he doesn't do well and because he's not happy, he doesn't have good relationships and because he doesn't have good relationships, he doesn't feel good about himself because other people don't feel good him and he acts out almost in a defensive mechanism like attacks people and acts Shitty to people in almost a way of sort of taking away focus from his own failures, his own internal disputes. So he's sort of externalize those in this weird way and become this aggressive kind of shitty person.

Speaker 3:          00:41:56       Like here's a perfect example of that in my opinion, in a successful person, Donald Trump, right? I mean, why is that guy so shitty about Mexicans? Why doesn't he have a balanced nuance perspective? Why doesn't he understand that you were insanely lucky? You Fuck your dad gave you what, 2 million bucks to start a business and you, you, you make it seem like it's no big deal that your dad loaned you all this money and you're a self made man. That's ridiculous. First of all, you live in America and you're white. Okay? Right away, you're lucky as fuck. And then you're involved in this system that it's allowed you to fail and go bankrupt and you know, and skirt away from all your bills then come back. But the idea being that here's the guy that has this insanely successful life monetarily, but yet still, you know, we'll have these ridiculous short, shortsighted opinions that he rants and about and talks about and these, like these Syrian refugees and he's like, you know, we need to keep out of the country, keep keep Muslims out of the country. We need to figure out what the hell's going on, like, what the hell is going on? Like what you're again, you're not dealing with units, you're dealing with massive amounts of human beings that are all different and varied. Like why does he have this sort of aggressive fuck you, you're a loser approach. What, what is the conflict? How does, how does he get out of that and have a more balanced perspective to deal with what is really in a lot of people's eyes, people that are way more unfortunate than he is.

Speaker 2:          00:43:27       Yeah. And you know, there's a bias in society to just appreciate these external success is, oh, you're wealthy, Oh, you've accomplished this. But we undervalue those in the victories over that internal self to get somebody more conscious, get somebody more open in their heart, like those are like shoved to the side. So everybody's been kissing trump's ass because of the power that this money creates in the power of that. And we may even vote him in as president in this crazy, crazy world even though he's completely ignored probably the most important thing that any human could do, which is go inside and have that accurate self reflection like, hey, am I a Douche bag right now? And one of the best ways to do that is with the plants or with meditation or anywhere where you get still and allow that force of consciousness to actually take control of the helm of the mind. Push the ego aside and show you the truth. But that's why people are terrified of it. That's why trump will never, you know, go do Iowaska and the jungle and I'll never. Maybe you will. Maybe he would be amazing. If you want to. Man, I'll hook it up. I will hook you up. We'll go down. It'll be. Could you imagine

Speaker 1:          00:44:32       if like in mid cycle he just completely shifted gears and said, I had a moment. I had a revelation and I realized that what were the direction we're going in? It's just not right. Everybody be like, wait, you are our only hope. You're Obi wan Kenobi. Motherfucker year. You're Obi wan Kenobi for white people. Like, who else is there? Hillary Clinton, get the fuck out of here. There's so many guys that are just not going to vote for a woman. Especially a woman who was married to Bill Clinton, who looks like a shrew. It's just not happening. Oh, who else? Bernie Sanders. Get the fuck out of here. There's so many people that are not going to vote for Bernie Sanders. Especially when you realize that he wants to literally literally 90 percent. He wants to tax rich people. Ninety percent like this. I thought that was bullshit. I thought like, well, that's not true.

Speaker 1:          00:45:20       He didn't really say that. That's probably an exaggeration. Nope. Nope. He's actually said that and he goes back to like, I think it was Roosevelt, I forgot who it was. It was an office during the war and there was at one point in time where they sort of effectively taxed rich people at extremely high rates and you know, he was talking about the efficiency of that, but the idea of taking money from successful people and just such an insane disproportionate amount and then giving it to what the government, who is the government, the biggest waster of money to you, you fuck like lifelong politicians and people that are for whatever reason, working government jobs like get outta here. You can't just take the money from people that have achieved that, but that's not the solution and it's an ineffective strategy because you can only tax people on their income.

Speaker 1:          00:46:07       You can't tax them on their wealth. Right? It's all income tax based. So all of the wealth that's already been accumulated by all of these people, you know, you can't even get that money anyway. So you're just taxing the people who finally are getting successful enough to make the money as well as some of the people who have residual money, but it's not going to even achieve practically pragmatically what he's trying to do. He's trying to be Robin Hood, except he's only taking the new money. Not the. Not The existing 90 percent of the wealth that's all stored up. It's just a crazy. It's just crazy all around. But the, the unfortunate part is his ideas on pretty much everything else are pretty fucking cool. Yeah. You know, so it's like he has this dichotomy and that's these choices that we get stuck with your alright, pretty good over here.

Speaker 1:          00:46:49       But you're totally completely incompetent in this one area. You know, it's this weird thing, these weird choices that we have to make. Well, I don't think we get anything other than that. When it comes to established people running for president of United States of America, I think in order to get to that position, you have to be so compromised. You have to be so deeply entrenched in this insanely flawed system that someone who was really radically outside of it is looking at it and saying, Hey, this whole idea is ridiculous. Having one person running the whole thing is preposterous. It doesn't make any sense. It might work if there was 50 of us and even if there was 50 of us, there'd be like 20 people that don't like how it's running and but the idea to do it with three plus million people, it's insane. It's insane.

Speaker 1:          00:47:31       It's insane to have this one guy and then we watched. First of all, Bernie Sanders looks like he's a thousand years old now. What the fuck is he going to look like after four years in office? I mean, that guy is going to be dead. Obama looks like dog shit. I mean he looks old as fuck right now. If you compare him to what he looked like seven years ago, that is not seven years of aging at some radically accelerated aging due to stress and tension and the reality of the world itself, the massive grain of his hair. He just looks tired all the time. He looks like a different person. It looks much more frail, mean he's experiencing some insane stress and part of that stress is a job that you're not supposed to do. No one's supposed to have that job. You're not so opposed to have the weight of the world.

Speaker 1:          00:48:18       You have to sleep in this fucking house in the park. And if people around you constantly earpieces and guns and bulletproof cars, look at the difference. Yeah, it's brutal. The fucking difference. We're looking at a photo right now of Obama from 2009 and Obama from 2014 and all my God, I mean he looks like he's 20 years old plus 20 years older plus and, and really the tools to help people cope with that kind of stress or just tools that aren't really that prevalent and talked about like what, what is he doing to help mitigate that, you know, is he, is he going in the float tank, you know, is he doing these different things that you have to do to be able to release some of that stress and be supported properly? Definitely not. This one's fucked, man. This photo is fucked. We're looking at him from 2008 and 2013.

Speaker 1:          00:49:09       Oh my God. The poor bastard. Wouldn't you love to just have that guy to sit down with them and go, tell me what is really going on. Just tell me, what is it like when you get in that fucking office? Uh, who are you talking to from Halliburton? Who, what, what dude pops out of a fucking a metal grate in the ground with steam and fire and presents to you, you know, he like he hands you want to pitch fork of manifesto of ideas that, you know, this military industrial complex wants you to promote any kind of leadership position is really crazy. I think if I was thinking about it recently in war, like you know, you applaud these generals for these great strategies, you know, and, and sometimes the strategy is you put a small number of troops in one area to lead the main core of your enemy army toward those troops so that you can trick them and attack their flank or something like that.

Speaker 1:          00:50:07       Classic, like General Strategy. But really what you're saying is, all right, these hundred people, they're gonna die for sure. Like they're gonna die for sure. So who's up? Who's up for that one? Okay, you guys, you go into die for sure category and then the rest of the army will come and we'll kick some ass. Like what a fucked up that is. You know, like knowingly saying that you have no chance. Like there's no fight. There's no like you can run away through the back hills, you're going to fucking die. That's the plan. So that we can kick more ass over here. I mean you have to be something of a sociopath to be able to pull that off. But again, that's. You know what these great general, these quote unquote great generals have all had to do is just make these crazy decisions and being president is a little bit a part of that too.

Speaker 1:          00:50:56       You have so many people that they become like numbers and it's no longer just each individual like, how's this going to affect this dude? This dude who is me living a different life. How's it gonna Affect that dude? And you can't think about like that because you go crazy if we're going to do it. It's just a weird dynamic, which we're not really prepared for. You know, we're prepared for these kinds of tribal dynamics where, you know, we're working, we know everybody that we're leading. There's the chief of the tribe, maybe it's under 150 people. If you look through anthropological records, that's usually how it was. And that's generally, you know, the leader back in the kind of tribal organization. But then as it gets massive shit gets crazy. Yeah. I think in war there's the ethos of the warrior and the warrior ethos is it's a different reality and I think for a lot of those guys not talk to this one dude who's a navy seal and he was explaining that the way a lot of guys look at it and him included was that if he died in combat, that he would die as a warrior and that that would, if he was killed by another warrior, that is a time honored way to go and that this is just the way.

Speaker 1:          00:52:06       And this is the ways pursuing that he's accepted that way and because he's accepted that way and all of the exciting aspects of it, like one of the things you talked to people that have been to war about it, like Jocko says, it was the greatest time of his life. You're not supposed to say that, but I'm glad he does. I'm glad he's honest about it because when someone's honest about it, folks like you and I that are outside of it, they go, oh, okay. Well how do I fucking internalize this? How do I. How do I absorb this information and bounce it around in my head and make it have it make sense to me? But he's being honest. He's saying, look, this is the life I chose. This is the path I wanted. I'm there and I'm very excited and happy to be there.

Speaker 1:          00:52:48       I'm happy to lead and I'm happy to be a warrior. So if you're going to die, you know you live, you die. Is he wrong? No, it's just, we, we, we have this idea that the way we're living is the only way to live and that this is the wrong way to live, but if you want to fucking make Omelets, you gotta crack eggs, you want to get into Ramadi, he gonna have to shoot some bitches. Yeah, there's just no way around it. And then to have that accomplished. I mean, I think we could all agree that there's some bad people in the world in order to, to somehow or another keep those bad from going straight up. Hitler on us. There's some ass kicking has to be done in the current state of humanity the way it is right now. Unless we, uh, utilize my method from shining happy jihad.

Speaker 1:          00:53:35       My 2006 CD where I say we use crop duster planes, fucking cover the entire Middle East with chronic smoke for a couple months. And even that might not work to do as a sober up and go back to the old ways. Unless something radical happens, it changes humanity. We're always going to have this struggle between quote unquote good and evil. And when you have evil you need, you need ass kickers. Yeah. If you don't have ass kickers, you got a real fucking problem. So you need people that have this warrior ethos, this mentality to go in there and get the job done. And sometimes that means you have to sacrifice troops or you have to put them in danger. You have to. You have to understand that there's going to be risks and those risks are going to be horrific. The results of those risks are potentially horrific.

Speaker 1:          00:54:21       Yeah. And that's absolutely what you have to do. It's actually something that the body does really well. You know, if you think of all the cells, like many organisms, think about what happens when you go into a Cryo tank. You know when you go into a Cryo tank, all of the blood rushes to the core of your body to protect the most vital parts. You know, your organs, the things that you need for the whole organism to survive the blood leaves the extremities, like the fingers and the toes. It's like, fuck it, sorry, fingers, toes. Yeah, you gotta go, but you're on your own, like if you die you die. We're going to live, you know, by doing that. And that's kind of the way that these armies have to go. So there is certainly a model, it's just, I would hate to be that person that looks out at some garrison of 100 people and being like, you're going in this basically suicide mission, so the rest of us can do.

Speaker 1:          00:55:04       It's a brutal thing to do. But again, the warrior ethos, you know, these people would go, you know, look at you and probably go, Whoa, you know, like, this is it, this is what we're committed to, the mission, the mission is greater even than our lives, you know? Yeah. And there's a lot of people that look at the way the world works and as far as conflict and say, well, the only reason why we're involved in these conflicts is because United States is invaded all these countries and they've done this and the foreign policy and it's caused this and that. And there's probably a lot of truth to that. There's probably a lot of truth to that, but at the end of the day, there has always in less, the entire world is brought to the exact same standards as far as standards of living as far as access to resources as far as just peace on earth.

Speaker 1:          00:55:53       If the entire world is not up to the same standards, you always going to have conflict and you're always gonna. Have ambitious people. He always gonna have those pollutants out there. You always going to have these dudes that just decide to just dominate a country that's smaller than them or take over an area of the world and then you're going to have horrific human rights violations and then you have to make choices. Do we allow this country that's doing this to this smaller country and subjugating it's people and torturing the women and won't let girls go to school and do we allow that to happen? Or we decide that we're the police

Speaker 3:          00:56:24       force of the world and it's a. it's a complicated question because when you don't do anything, then evil grows and then it becomes really powerful and then you get to a Hitler type situation that can happen. People think, well, that's not gonna happen today. Jesus Christ. That was not long ago. Sure. It doesn't seem like if you look at those black and white night, fuck, he's got his arm up in the air and fucking people screaming. It seems like eons ago. Nope. Nineteen forties, forties, man.

Speaker 2:          00:56:54       Love externalizing an enemy and you see it now. I mean, it's actually starting to happen with all Muslims, all Muslims. For some people have become the enemy because instead of it makes it really easy to define yourself against an external force. Where as I was saying, it's really difficult to actually go within and battle those internal forces where you know, the real conflict is raging. It's much easier to say, oh yeah, the fuck and Muslims. Yeah, let's go get them. You know, and that's, I think a tendency that we've, all we've all had is just to go fight these external things in this crazy video game we call life. You know, we like the boss battles and we like that kind of, that aspect of the game because it's very active. It's very proactive. You're out there with your hands and you're swinging and you're shooting and you're doing things.

Speaker 2:          00:57:41       Whereas like these, exactly the internal battles, you have to have a totally different strategy. It's the strategy of actively surrendering, like, okay, I got to let that go. I got to let go of that attachment. I got to see myself and be okay with my death. I got to. It's like a completely reverse side of the coin where to make progress in that it's surrender. Whereas to make progress and more it's vigor, you know, it's like these, these two dichotomies and I think ultimately the way the game is best played because if you're playing on both sides of the coin, you know you're playing externally with vigor and you're playing internally with that surrender forest and advancing on both sides. And that's, you know, that is the idea of the warrior poet. That's the the warrior who can go externally like Musashi and kick some ass and then go back to his dojo and paint colors, calligraphy, and tap into his internal thoughts are in meditation or are all of these things. I mean, that's, to me the ideal one is not better than the other. They're both important, you know, just let's expand the opportunities that we have as humans to play both sides of this amazing game and

Speaker 3:          00:58:46       you know, I think there's parallels to with what we're talking about about the body. Then we want things to change quickly, but the body does not change quickly the body. It's sort of a long, slow process and I think that's what's going on with society and civilization itself, that there's this. We would like, we want war to be over. We want everybody to live at peace. We want everybody to have a livable wage and you shouldn't live in poverty and we got too many. There's wealth disparity. We're going to fix it all. You know it, it doesn't necessarily work that way. The debate is going to start changing people's ideas, people's ideas, going to change their behavior and their actions, and then ultimately we would hope that we'd get to a better place than we were today someday. Just like if we look back at 1200 add and look at today, I think we would all agree this is a way better place.

Speaker 3:          00:59:41       Yeah, yeah, for sure. I mean the heart of the dark ages where it's actually literally dark outside, but, but also just the practices were completely fucked. You know, think of the inquisition that was, that was the most ridiculous thing in history. You know, all of these people burned at the stake for some weird idea that they were, which witches aren't real? Well, it sounds a lot like what's going the hysteria that's going on today about Isis, these ideologies that manifests themselves and become toxic to all those around them until people rally against it or realized the folly of that way and then change. They meet that resistance. They find this horrible thing in the world and they resist it and they fight against it and then things get better and it's kind of like a constant cycle that's going on that we would like to end.

Speaker 3:          01:00:35       We were like, we would like it to be over now, please. We would like to not have conflict, but we've got a lot of problems. First of all, we don't understand each other. It's fucking what? How many different languages do you know? How many languages are there? I don't know what the fuck those people are saying. I don't even know. I see. I have some people that I follow on twitter that are Russian, like a Russian fighters, and they'll occasionally, they'll tweet something with their crazy Russian words. Those Russian letters. That one looks like a tree house. Looks like pants, pants, treehouse. What are you trying to say? What the fuck is that like? What is he saying? Don't worry. Or Hebrew. You know, you see people that write in Hebrew. You're like, okay, what does that. What is this? This even these aren't even letters or Chinese or Japanese or Korean or all fucking Christ.

Speaker 3:          01:01:24       We see we can't understand each other, so it's the idea of all of us coming to these same conclusions and having these same ideals when the world vary so radically and drastically as far as conditions and poverty and you know, and, and, and then you know, places like North Korea that had just been under the boot of a dictator since the jump and they're just stuck. They're stuck in this insanely shitty spot. The idea that your life in Pasadena is going to be the same as some guy who's stuck in North Korea who might, you know, as mother and father might've grown up in prison. I mean, there's people that are born and raised in prison camps. They're, the world's not even, it's just, it's just not an until we get past all of these conflicts that we see right now, it's not going to be even.

Speaker 3:          01:02:16       It's not going to simply the United States just stops invading these countries. Everything's going to be great. It's not, it's not going to. It's now. It's not going to fix North Korea, just not. It's way more complicated and they don't know they've lived this way their entire lives. Many of them don't even know how it's going on, like what's going on in the rest of the world and they're not. They're not going to change that quickly. It's going to take a long ass time. They might have to die off. That might be what's going on with United States politics as well. When you're looking at what we're seeing now with Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump and ted Cruz. Get the fuck out of here. When I'm, when I'm looking at in my mind is like a dying campfire so he can kick around a few embers. There's like a little something left here, but it's eventually going to die off. I mean, this is, uh, these are this. There's no teddy Roosevelt's. There's no JFK. There's, there's no fucking real leaders that are running okay.

Speaker 2:          01:03:16       I think they'll only come when the people demand that they come when the people demand that people have consciousness or reading them. But now at this point we're too easily distracted. You know, were they found these little hooks, these ways to tug and pull at our emotions and our fears and our different things that Kinda influence us into following these different preset paths. It's like, I know I'm not big into the whole conspiracy of the whole thing, but certainly it's very good marketing propaganda to hook people into following certain preset channels that keep the establishment where it is, but eventually that will break and I do think that's one of the reasons why there has been some intentional oppression of these mind expanding consciousness tools that are available to us because those tend to allow you to see the see the machine behind the curtain.

Speaker 2:          01:04:08       You know, that lets you see Oz. You're like, oh, I see you pulling that lever bitch. Like I know I kind of want to know what's going on. And that's a dangerous thing when you have this big establishment that's built on that. But I'm really optimistic. I think that it's going to change because of the Internet. I think actually a lot of these things wouldn't have been allowed to get to where they are if the Internet had already been around from the beginning because whistleblowers have been coming out information would it spread, but that same force, that free spread of information is going to start, you know, taking away all of these different shenanigans and all of these tricks that people are going on right now. We're just kind of tolerating them, but eventually I'll. Tolerance will get less and less and I think that will be an interesting and exciting

Speaker 3:          01:04:52       for sure. Yeah, I agree. And I also think that when you look at the way we conduct politics today, the way how the debates, they all stand in the most unnatural way possible. You're at a podium, which never happens in life. When do you ever talk to a friend? They stand in front of a podium. Can you imagine? Like if your girlfriend said, hey rob, come on over man, I'd really love to have a conversation with you. And then behind a podium

Speaker 1:          01:05:18       and she's like, there's your podium and this is my friend margie and Margie is going to act as our moderator and you're going to state your point and then I'm going to state my point. We're going to have an audience and the audience is going to cheer or respond in turn. Like why is there a fucking audience? These debates, why is there's this grand standing opportunity where you can say what the United States people deserve. It's a fair wage. What we deserve, what we want, what we want, equal rights, what we want. Black lives matter. And when you say all these things that make people yes, yes, it's, it's all orchestrated. It's all artificial and it's all. It's. It's the least natural and normal way to communicate possible. Normal, natural way to communicate would be sit down and have a conversation with these people and try to figure out what are your plans, how are you going to do this?

Speaker 1:          01:06:09       And then the, the rest of the world that's watching this gets to decipher and try to figure out, okay, is this guy makes sense? Is he full of shit he nobody's talking about. Does he have the data that he says he does? Does he have the possible resources to fix these issues and does this plan makes sense fiscally? Does it. Is there their numbers to actually pull this off or is it bullshit, but you don't. You don't get to that when you're. You're involved in this debate where there's a guy standing there talking. There's a whole fucking crowd of people behind him. Then these people that are on spotlights, they're wearing makeup. They have notes in front of them like, what is this? What is the end? Does that person have the character and that character under pressure? You know, that's one of the most important things.

Speaker 1:          01:06:53       Like when there's forces of pressure, are you going to crumble? Like even when I'm hiring, you know, add on it in the company, like one of the most important things is all right, do you have the skills, like what exactly what you're talking about? Have you done this before? Are you capable of, you know, being a chief technical officer, what's the code that you've written? You know, how have you been able to handle these situations, but then there's also like, how are you going to handle pressure? You know, for me, like that's a really important thing. So I'll do things informally to kind of test people out. Like we'll go do a workout if they're athletic, you know, we'll go do a hard workout and just see kind of how they handle that external pressure will go out and get really drunk and go out drinking and see like, oh, when you're drunk, like does some weird shit come up, little demons that are hiding in there that we need to find out about.

Speaker 1:          01:07:39       And so eventually then you get this opportunity to see and sometimes I'm dead wrong, I've been dead wrong before, but then at that point you have the ability to just say, Oh man, I was wrong. Sorry, this isn't the right fit and you know, you're out. But America doesn't have that opportunity. Of course you could impeach somebody, but that's this crazy process. You know, it's just this weird thing where you have all of this false hype and propaganda. Then they're there and then they're just there right now and it's like there's no accountability at that point. You don't really know what's going on. Well, Clinton was the last person to go through an impeachment procedure, right? I mean they essentially ever get that far.

Speaker 3:          01:08:16       I don't know. I don't know what will impeachment. We think of impeachment is being removed from office, but a peach meant impeachment essentially is being forced to sit down and review whether or not you should be removed from office. I think they actually get kicked out is a different phrase, different term, but he was and he was on the most preposterous thing ever. Getting head like it wasn't. It didn't have anything to do with how he was running the country. It was him lying. The way he described this encounter with this woman's mouth and his penis. You know that it is. The way he understands that was not sexual relations. Yeah. What the definition of is is. Yeah. It was a great line that he had there. Do you remember that conversation where they. They were grilling him and they were. They were giving him this.

Speaker 3:          01:09:13       They sat down with them and they were forcing him to recount what happened and describe in his, in his eyes why he felt like he wasn't lying and he's like, as as the way it was defined to me, I do not think that I had sex with that person and it was this weird fucking dance they were doing where you're like, what? What are we doing here? Like it's supposed to be about intent. What is intent? Like did anything, did anything happen with that check? Like can, can you say that? Did you guys hook up? You know, that's where hookup is like well defined. Hook up, hook up. As far as it's been explained to me. I did not hook up with that woman. And what is hookup? You got to ask fucker asked to. Mouth counts just jerks you off of the Oval Office desk. That's nothing.

Speaker 3:          01:10:06       Nothing. That's that. Who Care exactly does care. That's the crazy. Well we care because we catch you, we catch you. We catch you lying. Like that's one of the unique things about a guy like Charlie Sheen because in a lot of ways charlie sheen really did sort of pull the curtain back on a different machine, the machine of, of, of sort of what is it that people have a real issue with when someone gets caught doing something like whether it's smoking crack like Charlie Sheen did or whether it's getting blown like Clinton did. What is it that we really have a problem with? I think we really have a problem with almost more than anything is dishonesty. And when he was onstage when Clinton. Well it was a wherever he was, where he's like, I did not have sexual relations with that woman. When you see him say that and you know he got his dick suck.

Speaker 3:          01:10:57       Do you like wait a minute. Okay, well what's going on here man? Cause you, you're not being honest now and now we're in a situation where I know that your horse shitting me and then okay. And then they're going to tell you that they caught you, the girls got address. Got Your calm on it. Well hold on now. I'm not a liar, I just, as it's been explained to me is how I feel, and then you, you deal with all this, you know, this, ah, that feeling like that. Whereas Charlie Sheen comes out and goes, look, I was smoking rocks, you know, I'm a fucking winter. I'm winning every day. And I'm like, all right, you know, that's, that's what I do. You know, I, I'm, I'm banging hookers and smoking rocks. You're like, okay, I guess we're done. They kid fucking say anything. What, what are you going to say to a guy like that?

Speaker 3:          01:11:47       Obviously he's not the president. He's not running for president, not in public office. He's not a leader. He's just a guy. But he's a guy that, you know, was, it is refreshing when you hear that. I think that's what tiger woods should have done when all that shit came out and he should just spend like, look, I'm fucking tiger woods. I'm horny. Like, it's, it's, it's me like deal with it, you know, instead of being a hard sell to go to rehab and do these different things like sex rehab, like I could, I could imagine that there might be some value in that for somebody, but I really think that's just a way for people to retreat because of these crazy societal norms that say we shouldn't want to bang people. You know, it's like this is like the, the approved bullshit fallback position that all of us know is bullshit, but you have to go play this charade, you know, and figure it out.

Speaker 3:          01:12:34       It's just, I think we got to all start respecting like the truth about each other. Like everybody likes to have sex. Like let's just fucking get over it, deal with it. Like it's cool. Not only that, but the per, the type of people that wind up being president, the you, you have to be some insanely confident achiever and those people generally genuinely are generally both like to fuck, you know. And that's what the whole jfk thing was all about. Jfk was apparently like the biggest freak of all times. And when people who knew him, when they see how much of these stories are true, it's up to, you know, who knows, we really don't know. But what you hear is the ultimate super freak. I mean he was just in this time where the information didn't spread very quick. I mean we're just getting it now.

Speaker 3:          01:13:28       18 when she was in the White House and he made her blow his friends and stuff like that. It was like really freaky. Like in a pool. I keep the woman that had an affair with him. I think she was like, he had her suck some guy's Dick who was secretary of state or something like that in front of him in a swimming pool. And she wrote this book like, like a couple of years ago and it came out like. Or these stories were published a couple of years ago. It's like, it takes so long for that information to come out. But if Clinton was in office right now, like queued Lord. Yeah, good Lord. What stories would come out like, whoa, crazy. But if JFK was in office, he would make Clinton look like a fucking in in our eyes because

Speaker 1:          01:14:12       the data didn't get out while he was alive. He's a great man and that's how we look at it. We look at it. He's a great man. That was a, a huge champion for civil rights and he was gunned down by a horrible person who is probably working for the CIA during his prime. Then. I mean, what about Putin? He's got it locked down, don't Russia. And nobody's fucking with him in the system. I mean, he's murdering people, allegedly. Supposedly. Yeah. Yeah. It's a, it's a weird. It's a weird thing now where, you know, there's such a spotlight on the wrong shit. You know, we get so easily distracted by these, these things that really don't matter, you know, because we've set up this false paradigm. People aren't supposed to have sex and people able to have the most sex in the world. The most powerful people, athletes and presidents are supposed to be faithful in this monogamous relationship.

Speaker 1:          01:15:07       And I think as we look forward into the future, I think people are going to start to understand each other a little bit better and some of these expectations are just going to drop. I mean these were some old control mechanisms put in by the church. Like you want someone to be relying on the church. Well make them guilty for something that they will always be guilty for, something they cannot control, sexual desires. Make them guilty for that and make you the only person to have the cure. So create a problem that everybody's going to have and have you be the cure you. You can only, you can absolve them of their sins, you know, and it's this old control mechanism that was put in place, you know, maybe partly to keep the society and this kind of regimen in order, but also to keep one particular organization empower and isn't.

Speaker 1:          01:15:54       It's sort of a byproduct of our lack of ability to read each other's minds and truly understand what each other are thinking. Like this ability to find the truth and actually get information. The ability to disguise that, to disguise it. With this false morality and this Norman Rockwell image that you're trying to project all that leads to this like massive confusion as to what the actual playing field we're on really is, and when we look at these media created versions of our world, whether it's murder she wrote or CSI or a television show or a movie or a coldplay song or some distorted version of human beings that we absorb into our database. Well, people are Clint Eastwood. People are Charles Bronson know people with a real clinics would the real cleanness would as an old man who's been divorced a shitload of times, who gets on stage and says a bunch of Wacky Shit. We. He pretends to have Obama sitting next to him and it does this add. It means he's doing a fucking ad libbed speech where he said he didn't even plan that out. He just had obama like a fake Obama sent. Do you remember that from the Republican? Oh my God. You never saw it? No. You never saw it? No.

Speaker 3:          01:17:10       Oh, Jamie. You must. You must. You must. It's. It's wonderful because this is the real clinics with the real clinics would was the guy who was married to a woman who made him do a reality show and I love cleaning, don't get me wrong, I'm a fucking giant fan of his movies. I'm a giant fan of the Spaghetti Westerns and the unforgiven and no, but who he is as a man is just a. just an old man who's a republican and he, because of the fact that he's famous, they allowed him to go on stage at this convention or whatever the fuck it was and give this insane speech where he had a chair next to him and he pretended it was Obama and he actually like was standing over him looking down on them like, watch this. This is hilarious. You go to, you're going to laugh your ass

Speaker 4:          01:17:58       ministration hasn't done enough to cure that and whatever. Whatever interests they have is not strong enough and I think possibly now it may be time for somebody else to come along and solve the

Speaker 5:          01:18:22       stand up white people.

Speaker 4:          01:18:29       Mr. President, how do you, how do you handle? How do you handle promises that you've made when you were running for election and how do you handle it? How do you handle it? I mean, what do you say to people or do you could just. I know people, uh, people were wondering, you don't. Well, I know even some of the people in your own party who were very disappointed and we did, didn't close Gitmo and I thought, well, I think get Kale closing Gitmo. Why close that? We spent so much money on it, but I thought maybe it's an excuse. What do you mean? Shut up? Okay. It just, I thought it was just because somebody had this stupid idea of trying terrorists and downtown New York City maybe.

Speaker 5:          01:19:23       Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:19:29       If anybody wants

Speaker 3:          01:19:30       us, it's wonderful to watch because he's, I'm sure a nice guy. I don't know. I don't know. Cleaning doesn't seem to be a terrible person, but just why close get my. We spent so much money on it. Well, why don't fucking keep the gas chambers open in Germany. I'm sure they spent money on those two. What the fuck kind of argument is that why close Gitmo? We spent so much money on it. That is some wacky old man, republican thinking right there. Sure. The. The idea that

Speaker 6:          01:19:59       say that will, what will, what will. Yes. We will work closer with George Martin

Speaker 3:          01:20:04       glass. Fuck he talking about. We're talking about a place where people are pulled out of school where people might've went to the wrong meeting. They might have known someone who knew somebody and they get locked up, put in these orange jumpsuits and stuck in these fucking camps for a decade. Yeah. Maybe that's not a good idea to have that.

Speaker 2:          01:20:25       You know what works. I think you brought up a good point when you said if people could read each other's minds. I think Bertrand Russell explored that, the philosopher and he was saying that, you know, initially it would just be whore. Everybody would retreat to their homes and be like, man, the world's fucking crazy. But eventually you just get kind of used to it. Yeah. And then you'd be like, oh, everybody has these same thoughts and these same things that are going on in their head and then everybody could actually start to track truth. You know, and just realize that, oh, everybody's thinking about pussy and or Dick or whatever you're thinking about. Everybody has these urges, has these conflicting forces inside their own heads. Even weird thoughts, weird thoughts when you're on this high place, that weird thought, man, maybe I should just jump off.

Speaker 2:          01:21:10       You know, like what happened? They're like these weird things that all of us have that we shoved down deep in some nook and be like, that's not me. That's not me. It's not me. You all have these fucked up things. We all have that urge when we see a kid making a beautiful sandcastle being man and be funny to just knock that shit over, even though we'd never want to do it. Like we have these crazy parts of ourselves. I think that's something that, you know, as I've gotten this past year, I did some pretty the most intense psychedelic journeys of my life, which actually I've never talked to you about. Um, but part of it was just reconciling the fact that we're a lot of things. We're not just the good thing that we, that we think we are, we're kind of everything. We're all parts where all the good were all of the bad and we're just a summation of our choices.

Speaker 2:          01:21:54       You know, it's really about like what we choose to be and harnessing that, that element of like I'm going to choose to be someone who loves someone who's someone who does good and brings out into the world, but you know, we're in that kind of morphic field is rupert sheldrick would say in that capability of man is all the evil and all the good, you know, the protector as well as the destroyer. I mean all of these elements are within the human psyche. And really I think the key is just to reconcile that and to forgive that. Like, all right, yeah, there's some fucked up animal parts of me that, you know, get a, get sexually aroused in certain situations that you shouldn't get sexually aroused in that get attracted to violent situations when that's actually hurting somebody and just reconcile. Like I'm going to choose not to indulge any of those, but that's a part of humanity, like the darkness is a part of all of us and I think that's like a key recognition and it's enough to just choose the light, to choose love and to choose to be who you want to be.

Speaker 3:          01:22:54       I think we're also dealing with a world that is so complex and so fucked up in so many different ways that to expect someone to be balanced and perfect and healthy is kind of insane. Expect someone to be completely free of any bizarre thoughts or ideas is ridiculous because we are a product or at least we are influenced by the world that we live in, right? In the world that we live in is insanely chaotic. Recognizing that and talking to that about that is a big part of the steps that's going to take to improve whatever society is. However we define it, whatever civilization is right now, there's gonna. There's gonna have to be steps that are taken in order to make it better and you got to kind of recognize that you're in chaos. Even if we're going to die, okay, this is gonna end, it'll stop and then new people will deal with the same questions that we're dealing with now and hopefully we were honest about our experiences so that they can gain some information without having to go through those same mistakes themselves and that's part of what inspiration is.

Speaker 3:          01:24:05       It's part of what reading biographies were all about. That's part of what talking to people that are wise and ancient and you know, unlike clinics, would they. They have some real like, yeah, you're like, yeah, Stanley Kripner. You can talk to some really old people who are really knowledgeable that have experienced some bizarre moments in life and that have come through the other end with some lessons and I think that what we're dealing with is a society and a civilization. What would human culture is today? Is this thing that's becoming awake? It's going, why are we doing this? Like when we're looking at what we're seeing on television in terms of these debates that we're talking about there, so preposterous. Well, they're there. They're carrying the momentum of decades and decades of similar debates that they. They feel like this is how they have to do it. When you watch the evening news, what you're watching is the evening news is the momentum of the decades of evening news, the expectations that people have.

Speaker 3:          01:25:07       If it bleeds, it leads and these things have always been this way and it's to change that. It takes a long ass time, but if you watch the evening news today and you watched the evening news from 1930, it is a fucking different. Humans are different. If you watch the way people talk from then and the way people talk today, if you. If you look at movies or music or media, things have become more complex and more honest and I think culture is becoming way more aware of these complexities and the importance of this. Honesty in art are attempts to decipher what it means to be alive. There are attempts to decipher what it means to be a person. What is the most harmonic way? What where, where? How can you get through with harmonious with the most harmonious way to get through this experience?

Speaker 3:          01:25:57       What's the way to make the least amount of mistakes and create the most amount of happiness and have the most amount of friends happy as well, and what is, how is there a zero clear way? No is a trial and error thing that's going on. There's a failure and success. There's a lessons learned sort of thing that's going on and it's not just going on with you. It's not just going on with United States of America. It's going on with the entirety of humans on the planet earth. There's a learning thing and it's based on how much data we're taking in and the data were taken today is radically increased. There's so much more data than at any other time in history that we're almost overwhelmed by it to the point where you just want to concentrate on gossip. He just want to concentrate on fucking distraction. Meek mill and drake beefing.

Speaker 3:          01:26:44       You know what I mean? It's shit. That doesn't mean anything, but why? Because is this almost in a lot of those cases, there's comfort in the simplicity of an affair. There's comfort in the simplicity of a two dudes that are going to fight and be like, I was watching some video of the game, the rapper beaten up some other APP. First of all to that dude needs to learn how to fight both of them. Fucking horrible to watch it's shitty technique as a commentator. I was appalled, but it's, there's something adorable about watching some really like clear conflict, really obvious stuff. It's, it's, it takes you away from the complexities. It takes you away from the ambiguity of the great picture where the great picture I think is about information. It's about information and, and figuring out how to apply that in good information.

Speaker 2:          01:27:42       Yeah, and my, one of my favorite ways to get information is just experientially. And again, you know, that's been part of my path is like figure out, you know, go deep within your own psyche and get that information out, you know, not just the external information about things that are going on in the world and these new structures that are in place. But like learn yourself, you know, learn about your own desires and weaknesses and fears and demons and these things that'll come up. You know, I remember I was in isolation for a month and I was doing a, what's called a [inaudible], which is a kind of a shamonic technology. I wanted to try. I was going to write my book anyway, so made sense, but I was basically meditating every night and with that clarity of meditating every night, which is something I don't usually do. It's, I'm kind of like feast or famine with that meditation practice.

Speaker 2:          01:28:28       But for then I was meditating every night and it started to shine a light on a lot of different aspects of myself. Nope. No, no plants involved at all. Like, and I started to see, you know, even little tendencies that I could, that I could cure that would come to me in my own imagination. Like I remember I was, I was in a fight with Whitney and I was, you know, really, really mad at her and you know, I didn't say anything mean or call her a bitch or anything, but I would like wasn't returning our calls. Right. And I knew kind of that was like, that was hurting her for sure, but I didn't about it like this, I'm not going to answer that call she can do with that. And so I go into my meditation and I start seeing this, like this image come up of this gorilla with these big old horns and she's taking this stock of stock of roses and it's hitting Whitney with the stock of roses, like the thorny part.

Speaker 2:          01:29:21       And I'm thinking like, what the fuck is this? Why is this in my imagination here as I'm doing this meditation? Then I was thinking about it. I was intentionally not talking to her because I knew it would hurt her, you know, but to me it was like my, my mind was saying like, as long as you don't say anything, you're cool man, you know, it's all good, but just shined a little light and like, no, it's not cool under any circumstance to intentionally hurt somebody you love. Even if it's just being quiet, you know, like that's fucked up too. So you get these little pieces of information where now all the sudden, you know what I thought was like unacceptable behavior. Oh you just go quiet. That's acceptable. It's not being mean, you know? Oh No, no, no. That is mean. That is kind of fucked up because you're withdrawing your love and you're hurting somebody. So these little like course corrections that can come from the knowledge of going within. I think that's one of the most important things we can do as well as absorbing all the knowledge externally. Like put as much focus on the inside as the outside.

Speaker 3:          01:30:21       Well, most people, when they get involved in any sort of an argument with somebody, they immediately start shoring up their defense, you know, fuck her, I told her this, and you have this whole like, you have these walls set up, you have your armor meant you have every, all your weapons. If she says anything about that, I'm going to bring up the time. She fucking did this. And that's why it's so frustrating for people when they have a conversation about something like, you know, hey, how come you didn't put gas in the car? You know, you said you, you fucking dropped the car off and I'm fucked. Now I've got to find a gas station. Yeah. Well you know, you should have done this last week when my friend came over and you told her like, what does that have to do with anything? Just always built up resentment and the built in defense and instead of handling that situation like I remember dating girls in the past that you could never talk to them about something because they would bring up some other shit that was completely nonrelated and not even address what you're talking about.

Speaker 3:          01:31:17       They would just talk about some other thing that happened a month ago or six months ago or a year ago. Like, oh my God, like, I can't. This is not going to happen. We can't do this. You can't. You can't talk about the like, what will you need to fucking admit the fact that you did. That has nothing to do with what we're saying. Right? Nothing to do with what we're saying, but they've got their defense shored up. They've got their walls up, they got their weapons and they're ready to fucking go to war and that's what it is. You know? It's, and it's so easy to get stuck in these kinds of mine because the ego wants to be right. The Ego wants to be superior. The Ego's first line always is how dare you and you want to win. You want to win too. Yeah. If you don't believe that you're beyond reproach, even if you don't believe you're innocent though this is a fucking game of and you want to figure out how to get that king knocked over.

Speaker 3:          01:32:02       You want to get to checkmate. Yep. Yeah, and that's. It's definitely the sticky little trap. Whereas when you find yourself in that, you know, the solution has actually let the mind with all of its manifestations go and just focus back to the heart. Focus back to those truths, like the platinum rule that we talked about like, oh, that's another me living a different life. Like that's not fucking crushed them and when and hurt them. Let's just see what's best for the good of both of us and like take it back to that simpler kind of slower truth that we find like deep within our own consciousness inside our heart. And there's also a reality that some people you got to let go because you're not on the same path as you and they will drag you down with that. You know, you should have done this and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

Speaker 3:          01:32:49       There's some people that were will always be in conflict, are always going to be fucking up. They're always gonna, not pay their taxes and being this constant state of fucking chaos. They're always going to be caught lying. They're always going to be doing this or stealing or there's people that are going to always do something wrong and you can't keep them in your life because they have to find their own path. Even if that is you living another life, you're not helping them by enabling them now, by continuing the cycle of like makeup, like fight makeup, fight makeup, come to some acknowledgement within denial afterwards, you you will be caught in their own conflict and that same sort of thing where I said that the complexities of life oftentimes lead us to pay attention to simple, stupid shit like you hear Kanye is going to get divorced from Kim because Ron, well, what is that?

Speaker 3:          01:33:42       It's like you're. You're looking for some simple stupid, clearly, easily defined shit to distract you from the complexities of the world. Well, if you get involved in a friendship with someone that's really fucked up and, and you know, steals from you or just have some horrible shit going on, that debt will take away from all the other stuff that you're doing. It will become a massive part of your life and that conflict, which may you may be completely innocent. He might not have anything to do with it, but you're trapped with this person that might have a drug addiction. Like if you have someone like for people, a lot of people that have family members that are hooked on drugs, it's insanely, extremely frustrating because they'll like, like, uh, I know guys who have stolen from their own mother to pay for their drug habits. Yeah. Could you imagine you have a child and you raise your child and your child is stealing from you to pay for drugs and you're kind of in denial about it and you, but you're trapped. You're in this conflict with this person and there's almost no way in your mind to fix it, to make it better. And it becomes your life. You know, if you have a child and your child constantly in and out of jail and you know, fucking up and doing horrible things,

Speaker 2:          01:34:58       you, you become trapped by that relationship that you have. You have, you have a right to your own happiness and we got to make sure that you protect that, you know, and these people who are living on compulsion, it's almost like they've forgotten their forgone, their right to choose their ability to choose their compulsion. It's compulsion for more drugs. That's compulsion for more emotional turbulence. It's compulsion for needing something like that. And those people are naturally like the hardest to be around because they don't have that stillness where they can, you know, kind of wrangle their ability to choose, you know, to me like choices, like breath, like it's going to happen no matter what. We're going to make decisions no matter what, just like we're going to breathe no matter what you know. But then there's also the ability to wrangle your choice and decide how you breathe.

Speaker 2:          01:35:45       Maybe deep breath, you take control and you actually can maneuver with that choice and actually start to make reasonable decisions of, you know, acting on your own volition rather than compulsion and getting people around you who are also able to do that is so key because then you can actually have some freedom to make decisions and to build cool shit or to explore cool things or have, you know, have a lot of fun and those are the people that I think are going to be the most beneficial to be around. Yeah. And also you build momentum together. That's the thing about having friends that are like really happy and fun and warm and, and doing what they want to do. Like when I have friends that are successful, it makes me excited about success. If I have friends that are involved in good things, everything's going great.

Speaker 2:          01:36:35       It gets me excited about doing more myself, getting more good shit done, enjoying life more. And then when you spend time together there's all this fun and laughter and it's like good times. Whereas if you're involved in these negative patterns and these patterns of like constant chaos and mistakes and deception and Horse Shit and addiction or whatever the fuck it is, those patterns seem to just be overwhelm everything else in life. Yeah. One of the most impactful things that I did last year was I went on that summit at sea cruise and I thought it was not going to be that cool, but what was the most cool part? There was some great speeches, some good content. Is it what is summit? It's so. It's like a curated group of entrepreneurs, thought leaders, musicians, artists, different people who have. They've invited to come basically hang out for a little while and interact and so there's some speeches and people give content. There was the CEO of Uber and a Schmidt, the ex ceo of Google and there was a bunch of. Bob Pittman was there, gave a great speech and Shep Gordon, the famous music agent. So a lot of like bigger names. They are giving speeches and doing their thing, but there's just the general guest lists with people who were somehow, you know, doing something cool, but what the effect was is having 2,500 people who generally all, everybody there

Speaker 1:          01:37:56       had the attitude of we can do anything, we can totally do anything. Like anything is possible. Like just the effect of being surrounded by 2,500 people who all believed that anything was possible was just fucking super inspiring because you never, you never, you know, aggregate that many people who feel like that those are the anomalies and most people are like, oh man, fml, this fucking sucks. You know, you get a good mix of both of those things, the inspiring people and the people who were kind of bummed out and that's fucked my life for people going and so, but being on the boat like everybody believing like, yeah, anything's possible. What are we going to create? How are we going to do this? What's the social problem? What's this thing? Just that alone was worth it, you know, to just be like, man, that was fucking cool because your mind takes in all of that.

Speaker 1:          01:38:45       You kind of like absorb it if that's. If that's the norm around you. You know, like there's a lot of people say that you're the average of your five best friends. Like if that's the norm around you, you start to believe that even more strongly to like, fuck yeah, it's possible. Like what do we want to do? What, what do we want to create? Isn't that why being in a really horrible neighborhood is so insidious, like being born and raised in a horrible neighborhood is so insidious because you're kind of trapped by your environment a lot of ways, but that's what one of the things that people that you know have that pull yourself up by your bootstraps mentality don't take into account. It's like these people, they don't see that. Like where are they getting this? Or you're asking them to build an insane, raging fire with nothing but wet trees and to rocks to bank and stuff like that.

Speaker 1:          01:39:33       Pull yourself up by your bootstraps. I've done it well, no, you had a fucking lighter. Okay, and you had newspapers and you had dry wood and you had a fireplace in a beautiful mansion and you were watching people build fires your whole life. You know, and everybody knew how to build a fire. So this idea that everyone starts on a level playing field and you just need to escape from your environment because you're ambitious and you know you're, you only ambitious if you're allowed to be ambitious like you. You have to have someone around you that has some sense of difference that there's some. Something can be done that, that is more, more pleasurable, something can be done that is better. You can improve upon your surrounding you. You have to see that if you don't see that, you just assume, well, this is how we live.

Speaker 1:          01:40:24       We scratch and claw where like the chimps in the jungle that steal from each other and beat each other over the head. And then we're going to have to figure out a way to survive. And the way to survive is scratch and claw. Well, if you're in, you know you live in some horrible, poor neighborhood and that's how it is. Everybody is survival of the fittest around you all the time, all the scratching and clawing and that's your reality that you have to adapt. You have to stay alive that way and that's the dark ages. That's the inquisition. That's like your. This is the environment you're in. It's so hard to escape the environment or to change it. If you're stuck in a situation like savior in like some isis occupied city right now, like what? What are you going to do? Think positive. What are you going do?

Speaker 1:          01:41:08       Go to yoga. The fuck are you going to do you know you, you have to. Reality is a motherfucker and you have to accept the situation that you're presented with. If you, if you don't, this idea that you could somehow or another rise above just simply by thinking positive and doing the right thing. Well no, your, your, your, your situation is constant conflict. You involved in that. Unless you can figure out some sort of a way to end that across the board with the entire country. The entire world, the, the planet earth, all of humanity. We're always going to have issues. We're always, you know, there are certain circumstances though where that kind of external pressure, everything being so fucked up, we'll crack most people like you're saying, but then they'll occasionally be. These diamonds are formed. You know, these people who define themselves against this horrible resistance around them and because it was so hard for them to build the fire, to use that analogy with their wet ass newspapers and these two flints and they've just been striking and striking and striking when they actually do it.

Speaker 1:          01:42:12       Their skills that they bring to the table, they're the baddest motherfuckers around. So occasionally it can create these masterful human beings that are just defined in greatness by their struggle coming up. And I think we all know a lot of those people. You even, I think at one point said, you know, show me the great man that's a son of a great man because you know that you do need some of this resistance to really be as you know, as magnificent as you can possibly be in a lot of circumstances. But yeah, in general it's hard because while there'll be one diamond, there'll be, you know, a thousand pieces of crushed call that it's just the pressure of the environment is not supportive for the general population. It's also like that movie, um, was that band movie where they were, um, there was that a composer who was trying to get, he was the state, like the farmer's insurance guy who was a composer and he won like Academy Awards, Farmer's insurance guy.

Speaker 1:          01:43:12       He was a fuck, I can't remember. But anyways, he was like, he was like, he was a composer or like a, um, yeah. And he was basically taking one of his students and he would, he would take his students and he was like the worst coach ever, like just recently. So in whiplash, you know, it was the most brutal hours insurance guy. The guy from Oz. Yeah, the screamer. Yeah. So he would have, he died the most brutal methods for his whole people. I mean, they're playing until their fingers were bloody and he just basically broke everybody. He broke everybody. And what he was waiting for was that one diamond to emerge, right. And a lot of have that kind

Speaker 2:          01:43:52       of mentality. Like we'll break them down, we'll break everybody and then there'll be this greatness that comes. Well, it's really like super rare that that happens. And generally like not worth it, you know, like why not like have people enjoy music and lead by inspiration instead of this. Let's just fucking break everybody and hope that that one time you strike the hammer down, it doesn't break and the hammer breaks instead because you've actually struck a diamond. It's just kinda like weird ethos that I think a lot of coaches and a lot of people have. My High School basketball coach had that same thing. Like he was willing to make the entire basketball season miserable, completely miserable in order to try and get something out of the players, which never happened. We lost in the first round of the playoffs, no matter how highly ranked we were, because part of our motivation is just to get the fucking season over because we hated him.

Speaker 2:          01:44:43       Fucking hated him. So we had like mixed motivations, effective coach. And an ineffective and so, but there is that. You do create occasional diamonds with pressure, but for the most part it just crushes most people and sometimes those diamonds, they become like a guy like Nelson Mandela, that sort of elevated entire culture, right in their King Nelson Mandela, these different individuals who you know were defined by this, by this intensity. So it's not to say that it's a hopeless situation. It can create the greatest of the great, but it's going to be a real fucking challenge. It is, and for most people, expecting those folks that are in that environment to to behave the same way as people that live in a gated community in Pasadena, just it's completely unrealistic in. And that was the trump point. It's like, c'mon man, like you. You've had not just a silver spoon.

Speaker 2:          01:45:34       You've had the entire cutler early line in your mouth since you were a baby. You were born with it. The whole thing is it's, it's unfair. It's unfair and uneven. It's bizarre to me that some folks don't recognize that, that they don't see it. They don't. They don't look at it like, wow, there's, there's a lot of conflict out there. There's a lot of different conditions. They vary. It vary so much. Yep. I think there's also a tendency to say that, you know, to expect people who do, who are wealthy to just be totally happy and totally like avid together. Look at all the advantage you have when a lot of times you see these people, they're pretty fucked up, you know, but society says, look, you've had every opportunity. You know, you didn't have to struggle, you should be fine. Well, again, those internal forces or a motherfucker, you know, and if you're not dealing with those right, doesn't matter how much money you start with, you're going to have problems. You have all the money to access all the drugs in the world. You have all of the ways to escape and not any of the tools, you know, to actually help you overcome those. So in a lot of cases you see the children of these really wealthy people are some of the most fucked up people you know, around there. Just. Yeah. It's just a really interesting thing. Like you'd rather hang with somebody in a super poor neighborhood

Speaker 3:          01:46:50       who's just real and down to earth and mostly they have their shit together way more than someone living in one of these mcmansions somewhere. Well, they've been forced to deal with conflict. They'd be forced to find solutions. They've had been forced to develop character. We define success too much by Zeros, by numbers, by yeah. How much do you have? How much money do you have? That's the ultimate goal of success instead of are you a happy person? I was listening to this Ted talk and it was a woman who was a model and she was talking about how she hit the genetic lottery. She was really honest about it. She's like, for better or for worse, you know, this is what has been my life. This is, this is my existence. And she said that a lot of people have this idea about what makes you happy.

Speaker 3:          01:47:36       If my legs were thinner, I'd be happy. If my hair was Shinier, I'd be happy. If my face was, my bone structure was better, I'd be happy. She said, but models in general are some of the most unhappy, insecure people on the planet, and she's like, I'll tell you, I am insecure. Like all my friends are insecure. They are crazy. There are all these nutty fucking models that are dealing with bulemia and Anorexia and speed and all these different methods that they use to keep their body weight down and all the fear they have of aging and you know, should I get botox and what treatments should I be doing? And they're constantly in this state of chaos and fear and a lot of it is over this weird gift that they have that becomes almost a prison, a prison to maintain this garden of beauty that you've been bestowed with from birth without any work at all.

Speaker 3:          01:48:36       I mean, we've all seen people that are just fucking beautiful. They just have a written and everyone's drawn to them genetically. And why? Why is that? Well, because nature wants you to come in that person to make people like them because they have good symmetry and it's really that simple. But that poll, that genetic poll is so overwhelming that we use it to sell cars and we use it to sell fucking condos and you know, anything, a woman with long legs, you know, stepping into a car, looking at you, they're here, makes you want to buy that car for whatever fucking stupid reason. And this idea that we have that. If I have that, I would be happy. No, because look at the people who have it. How many people who are super wealthy, how many Wall Street people in Manhattan right now are ready to jump off a fucking building? Their freaking. They might have 100 million dollars in the bank. They might be rich as fuck, but they're miserable. They hate. They're just want to do coke. And the other thing about people that are successful is oftentimes what they're doing is not pleasurable but the. But the reward is the numbers. The reward is having numbers so they indulge in that reward where they want to buy versace

Speaker 2:          01:49:48       and wear a rolex and have a this and a that and live in that or this and always keep up with the Jones'. And always have this quantified results that they can show success. Like, look, I've got, you know, in my day I've achieved blah blah, blah, and I've got a all of them, but who are you and are you happy? And that's not something that you can put down on a, on a ledger, you can't show that. You can't have a spreadsheet that shows your happiness. Yeah, I mean I've, I've been in all different types of circles from being indigenous places where they have virtually nothing in hanging out with local tribes in Africa and South America and different places than I've been at. I was at a birthday party where the musical lineup was John foggerty stinging and like some other crazy pan at a birthday party.

Speaker 2:          01:50:38       Right. Who's fucking birthday party present. Yeah. I don't know if I should mention her name, but yeah, it was a big hedge fund trader that was an old family friend. How much they spend, who knows? Countless, countless millions, you know, and not a party on a party for his birthday. So I was there and color for sure on the other way. They're happier. That guy's out there, so it was a weird thing though, because you know, he was actually pretty happy. He's a, he's a, he's a hunter and he's a. he's a cool dude and he was throwing the party more for his guests than himself, which made him actually happier. He was like the happiest person there because he was like, let me give you guys this, this awesome thing, but the majority of the people there, you could just feel I got pretty high before I went because I was by myself and I could just feel the sadness.

Speaker 2:          01:51:26       It reminded me of when I walked through the red light district in Amsterdam or it was just like the sadness, like nobody was giving these people like a real hug. It was always a, let me give you a hug and try and take your money and give you a hug. Try and take your money. And they were just so guarded by that whole paradigm that they've been in. You know, there's just these challenges that are across the board that we have to recognize in these traps, like the trap of more money. The trap of social media, when you know a girl posts something in a sexy photos and then looks immediately refresh, refresh, refresh, how many likes, how many likes, how many likes this quantification of how pretty you are, and then you start to live by that and then if you get less than that all, fuck, I only got 60 likes on that.

Speaker 2:          01:52:11       Better slot it up. Maybe I'm getting too old. Maybe any more botox. I'll do it as a new treatment of vampire treatments. Stab your fucking skin. Put baby blood in there. Yeah, exactly. So it's just traps and this were things a lot. I have a few girls that are follow on instagram just to look at their but pictures just to show how many different ways can you stick your butt out. How long can you keep doing this? And there's this one girl, her entire fucking instagram is her and her underwear sticking her butt out in various ways or her at the gym and what might as well be her underwear. You know,

Speaker 1:          01:52:46       jen selter got really famous that way. That was one of the instagram checks had like millions of followers just from showing us photos. Just ridiculous. Shell fast. Yeah. That just came out and said she is a real though, right? Like she has legs to that go along with it. It looks real. It looks real when they don't have the legs. It's like, wait a minute. Why is all that weight in your ass? Anatomically, it's like having boulder shoulders but having like little skinny arms. Why are your shoulder so big? It doesn't make sense. Is that her? Jesus Christ. What a good kid. Look at that, but it's go to go to some better ones were the ones right next to it in our dress. See down below, down below, wherever the photo that you were at sea. Go to the right there. You all pay up. Oh good Lord.

Speaker 1:          01:53:37       She just sticking her ass out and every photo, she's got that right. Kind of little sway back thing, but girls were like, look at her face. Now she's not even that [inaudible]. Guess what girls? Good enough here to let you know the ass. It trumps all those cheek bones, all the, all the other stuff that you're worried about. I don't know if that's real. That's a tricky. That's a tricky trap for her because she's just obviously, I don't know obviously, but there's going to be a seduction is going to say, you know, I define myself by how attractive my ass is. Like that's where a lot of she's going. She's scoring winds and her book based upon those instagram followers and likes. At a certain point she's going to be a 40, 50 year old woman in the ass is going to sag and it's gone or Kurzwell with fucking science.

Speaker 1:          01:54:27       Kurzweil figures it all it permanent giant ass, but you know, I think that that's an issue that particularly for females is something that's a problem when you put that much emphasis on beauty being and it's not female's fault, it's society and everybody's fault. You put that much emphasis on beauty being one of the defining self worth characteristics. Then when that starts to go, you're in this mad fucking scramble for as much surgery as possible to restore this youth rather than appreciating the gifts that each age bring. Like each aid should bring more wisdom and like, like the older obsolete as like that that you see down in the jungle that have fucking magic that they're able to bring like, yeah, I'm not young and beautiful anymore, but I've lived 65 years. I'm tuned into my instincts and I can fucking bring magic. I can heal with herbs. I can do these different things. That's all well and good, but their instagram pictures of shit. Version Celta pisses on those. Go Fuck Yourself. Old Magic Lady in the jungle. Look at these yoga pants fixtures. Fucking yoga pants have revolutionized the world, changed everything changed the game when you could look at a girl naked without her being naked, but better than naked because it's all compressed like it's not. It's not like you don't see the sloppy aspects of skin and flesh and tissue and deposits. Just that beautiful

Speaker 3:          01:55:44       pressed in shape and that shape is so deeply ingrained in the human brain. The colors of a flower, you know, you get your whole legs are all pink. It's amazing. It's a bright pink, a shocking bright pink or white or like, whoa, it's a white rose, right?

Speaker 7:          01:56:03       Like a total hack in your psyche. Like the monkeys that have those colored butts. Totally freak out the monkeys out. What the fuck is that? That boone ass fucking goddamn explosion of fireworks coming out of their asshole. They should be baboons, yoga pants. The most popular yoga pants would maybe be too much. It was just all flesh color, just all normal and then just fold baboons. It would be too much asking too much. It's weird.

Speaker 3:          01:56:39       Also, shapes, shapes become insanely attractive. Like I was looking at pornography the other day and the girl had a natural body and it's so weird when you see natural tits, big natural tits juggling around. She had a natural ass. I was like, wow, this is fascinating. Like these, these are fat deposits that are very attractive because they're. They're really good when you get pregnant. If you're pregnant, you should have wide hips. The baby comes out easier. Hip to waist ratio, hip to waist ratio has been shown by scientists to have a drug like effect on heterosexual males. Like it literally is a drug. There's a hip to waist ratio. That's almost like when a man sees a girl with small ways in a big ass

Speaker 3:          01:57:25       your your body, your body just goes, Eh, Eh, Eh, man on deck man on deck. Like you're going, you're about to go to war. Like it's time to be on your toes. Like there's a drug and that drug is right there. It's an ass. It's an ass and it's a form. It's a shape. But if you see someone and she's got the the back and ass of a Guatemalan housekeeper, you know where they have like that really the like the hat, the ass to weight ratio is nonexistent, is a, a parallel line like the twin towers from her shoulders down to her hips and was with, you know, there's just a weird sort of body and a flat ass. And like for whatever reason that is completely unattractive, she sidestep to a wall. All parts would touch at the same time. You don't want that. Well, it's weird like that. These shapes have these ingrained the. They're quantified in our brain, like you see these girls in their yoga pants, like that girl that has the millions of instagram pages. If the Guatemalan housekeeper with her big wide back in her flat ass had the same poses, like nobody would care. We need what we're looking for certain shapes. Yeah. There was even a theory that, you know, the reason

Speaker 2:          01:58:42       why people like cleavage and I don't know if this theory is accurate, but that cleavage actually reminds our brain of what a butt crack looks like. And so that's one of the reasons why it's sexually attractive to males. That shape of those lumps of fat pushed together in that kind of format is like a trick into our brain where it's like, oh, an ass on the chest. That makes sense. Kind of. But it also makes sense that, you know, if the tits are that big, they're touching together and once you were released, those mamas pop that snap on the Bra and they come out to play. Whoa. It's another bizarre one. Like tits or magic. They are fucking magical. Nipples are magic when they get hard, when you're sucking on a nipple and it gets erect like that is a magic moment. There's something exciting about that.

Speaker 2:          01:59:29       Yup. It's a fucking cool world we live in. You know, I sometimes think like if we were all just consciousness and more in reality didn't exist in this world, didn't exist, and we were like, man, what should we do? Well, let's create the fucking coolest video game ever. You know, something that has lots of boss battles and challenges and different things you can do and you can have sex and it feels amazing and you can accumulate things and you interact with other players. It's like the most massive multiplayer online experience possible and like, yeah, let's do that. Oh, I got an idea. Let's make it so that you think it's totally real when you're playing the game, you don't know it's a game. And then it was like, fuck yeah, that game is even better. And I kind of feel like that's really what we're doing here.

Speaker 2:          02:00:13       We're in this like the best possible video game that we could create and it's so good because we think it's fully real and it's such a good game that we can create mini games within the game and actually play video games in our video game and those are awesome too. Know it's like the most crazy thing that we've done and then we get back, you know, and in my believe that, you know, when we're done with this experience, we get back and we get to look and go, wow, that was a crazy fucking turn. And then get to decide like, yeah, let's go again. Let's do it. Let's play in this world, you know, earth world. And maybe there's another world. I don't know if there is, but maybe there's another world and you can say, Oh man, that's playing that fucking world. That world looks fun.

Speaker 2:          02:00:53       You know, and there's just this opportunity. And I think at least even having that perspective really gets me to appreciate this even more like, yeah, there's struggles, but every video game is going to have those struggles. It's gonna have that thing where you can barely beat it and it takes you a long time. That's like a good game. It's like it's just challenging enough where if you apply yourself completely and you're at the edge of your skill, you can win. Otherwise, if it's too easy, it's not fun. You throw that fucking game away real quick. Yeah. Yeah. Unless you live in the Congo, then you game sucks and your game, you're in a level that's really too hard. Blows get parasites and malaria and fucking war lords. Shit. This game's dogs playing halo with a bunch of professionals that just fucking headshot you all day like I

Speaker 3:          02:01:40       can't even play. Yeah, well, I'm fascinated by simulation theory. I'm fascinated by the fact that there's actual physicists that are bantering and throwing around this idea that it is possible that at one time in the future, in the near future, perhaps like within the next 20 or 30 years even, that they're going to be able to create an artificial reality that's indistinguishable from the reality we're currently experiencing. You are going to be able to enter into a fake world, whether it's through some sort of a a chip that they can put into your mind or whether it's some sort of a virtual reality headset that you put on that allows you to interface with some sort of computer stimulation. That's it makes it indistinguishable from reality. We're currently experiencing that. We're going to come to a point in time where it gets so good you can't tell if it's really not, so how do we know if we're not already in it?

Speaker 3:          02:02:36       How do we know? How do we know if that isn't the entire process? Being some sort of bizarre fractal thing like that. From the time a cell divides into two cells, becomes a multicellular organism, becomes a more complex multicellular organism, become sentient, becomes something that's creative, become something that's not just creative, but can manipulate its environment, has articulating fingers that change the atmosphere around it, changed the physical world in which it lives, alter the weather, alter the structure of the things that are around them and then gets to the point where creates an artificial world, creates a world that's so complex and so bizarre that it only exists in ones and zeroes, but is indistinguishable when you interface with it, that when you interface with it there as well, is that a real world? Who's to say it's not? Who's to say your worlds real?

Speaker 3:          02:03:37       If you get deep into your world, if you go deep into the subatomic realm, what is that? It's all fucking space and and magic. When you get into the world of subatomic particles. I have tried so hard to understand. I've watched lectures and listen to people give speeches about quantum theory and about the interaction of subatomic particles. Particles that are in superposition, which means they're still and moving at the same time. There was one of two possible outcomes. They blink in and out of existence. Observance of them is what decides which one they are. That's crazy. Well, how about the fact that they go away and we don't know where they go and then they reemerge somewhere else. They blink in and out of existence so we have no explanation for it based on our current understanding or a current ability to measure what's happening.

Speaker 3:          02:04:29       Maybe that'll get more complex and I'll have some more answers in the future when they get better at figuring this stuff out, but the current understanding of subatomic particles when they get into things like superposition is like you're dealing with magic. You're dealing with something that literally if you. If you. If it didn't exist and you tried to say, Hey, I'm going to create something that exists and doesn't exist as something that's moving and still I'm going to create something that's here and then it goes away and we don't know where it is and it comes back in another place. People would go, shut the fuck up, just shut up. You're talking about nonsense, but that's not nonsense. That's subatomic particles. These are. This is. This is a real acceptable aspect of of the scientific method. They've gotten down to this, they've examined this and this is accepted across the board, but these people that study it, well, what does that even.

Speaker 3:          02:05:21       How is that more real than this simulation that someone's created with the computer that makes you feel like you really are running from dinosaurs in Jurassic Park, you feel the wet leaves under your bare feet as you're sprinting away from a fucking raptor. How did. How has that more real? What is real and what is not real? That's going to get real fuzzy. That's going to get real strange when you have to define reality. When you know that this desk that I'm hitting on is filled with Adams and those inside those atoms. It's mostly space. We don't understand why there's so much empty space, but what is in there like? Why is it hard? Like why? How come when I knock on this? It's hard, but when I put my hand through water, it doesn't water of Adam's to like what's going on here, like what, what is real and what's not real or are definitions of what's real and what's not real or what can I put on a scale? What can I put a ruler across and measure, you know, what, how am I, what can I sell you? What can I put a barcode on and package it and sell it at whole foods? What is, what is real and what's not real?

Speaker 2:          02:06:30       I think that the way that in my explorations go in as deep as I possibly can, which is where I generally turn first, is the way that I've understand that understood it, is that collectively we did create kind of a simulation and at least in my own experiences, you know, illuminated in my own imagination perhaps, but collectively we did create a simulation and that simulation was led by, you know, just intent. The desire to say, yeah, let's do this. Let's have, let's have a physical manifest. Let's have things that we can knock our knuckles on and have this opportunity to do it collectively as that, as that unified force, kind of like the one voice in our body that collectively makes decisions even though we have all of these other organisms all vying for different things. Collectively. There was a yes and then there was like an intelligence in place led by the sacred geometry.

Speaker 2:          02:07:23       That very quantum stuff that makes things stuff. Then that artificial intelligence created the perfect solution for that initial intent which led and then ultimately leading us and maybe other sentient beings who could potentially create other worlds downstream as well, you know, and it could just continue with creating other and then eventually those sentient beings that have been created from the intent and allowing rules like artificial intelligence or sacred geometry. Allowing those rules to create the world perfectly. Because if you're actually trying to program that Shit's too complex. Not Possible. But if you have rules in place like all right, this artificial intelligence, we'll figure it out according to these different laws of evolution and reproduction will make these things combined together in certain ways. And, and that's, that's the rules of the system and it will flourish in a certain way that will survive until eventually there'll be other, you know, God, so to speak, these other sentient beings that then couldn't create eventually downstream worlds when their ability to create artificial intelligence in these other rules will happen and that can go to infinity, you know, and we may be somewhere in that infinity of, you know, and it just goes on forever and that's this mind blowing kind of thing where you're like, Holy Shit, you know, like we could be in a simulation that's part of a simulation, going to create another simulation, you know, like we're, we're our own universe in the multiverse, creating a micro verse which is a universe and it's own multiverse and just, it just goes on forever.

Speaker 3:          02:08:57       Just like that. We're not even high. We're sober stone cold sober. These full console owners. No, incorrect. I have a theory about artificial intelligence. I think the idea is very flawed. The premise is flawed. It is intelligence. It's not artificial. What's artificial? It's created on earth with materials. Why is it natural? It's created with come and it's not natural if it's created with silicon chips and it doesn't make any sense like it is intelligence, but it's intelligence that's not biological in origin in the sense of it's not based on the cellular structure that all biological entities on earth possess. Like it's something that's made with human beings manipulating the raw materials of the earth and creating something through programming, through, uh, you know, where the fuck they make computers. Whatever processes are involved that creates this intelligence, but it's not artificial at all. It's 100 percent real.

Speaker 3:          02:09:58       You know, if you eat, like my kids have a kitchen set and eat one of their fake tomatoes, you're eating a fucking piece of plastic that's an artificial tomato. That's hard official. This is not artificial intelligence. It's actual intelligence, but it's intelligence is created by people that have manipulated the raw materials of earth and then looked at their own shortcomings and sort of modeled this idea of a future being based on correcting what they see is wrong with themselves. But in doing so, what are we gonna? What are we going to do to what we are? I mean that's the big fear of artificial intelligence is if we create something better than us, we have to come to the realization that we are. It's so flawed that we cannot be repaired. Like the idea of coming in people and getting them pregnant and then a baby comes out of their pussy and then someone comes in that baby and you know when they become an adult and that the baby has a baby that comes out of their pussy and then we see that's the only way we do it.

Speaker 3:          02:10:58       That's it. It's the only way. It's the way it's been because the future is the past is no, it's not. It's not. It is a way to get to the point where we create these beings that are far superior than the what our biology is capable of making. I think you may be right, but I think we're in this hurry to do it when I think we should just be like, man, this is the fucking golden age. Genitals aren't going to be around forever. Like, let's enjoy the shit out of this right now. Like I really feel like we're in this transition point where we still have those base or animal instincts that no fucking good, but eventually I think you're right. We will transition out with whatever Kinda Kurzweilian ways that we can transcend death and you know, have different reproduction done in different way.

Speaker 3:          02:11:43       Like those grey aliens with no genitals, you know, and these different ideas of, of a different way to do it. But you know, those guys are looking at us like, man, that must be fucking fun. You know, there's some shitty fights, but it's fun. You could still get a muscle car. They're still legal before they get to this point where they're just going to be these fucking automotive. These cars are going to be all automated and everything's going to be self driven. There's going to be no excitement to that. And then there's gonna be no sex. People are going to figure out a way to make the same feeling that you get from sex available on your command. You know? Have you ever been in the hospital and they give you one, those morphine drips when you. I got my knees operated on back in the nineties and it was the real painful method where they do the Patella tendon graft, so they cut a piece of bone out of your Shin and take a strip out of your patella tendon and they take a chunk of the bone and your Shin and they open you up like a fish and then replace your acl with this piece of your Patella is painful as fuck.

Speaker 3:          02:12:45       And so when you're in the hospital they immediately put you on this motion machine and this motion machine. Your legs sits on this thing and it constantly bends and straightens. Bends and straight and spends is right after the surgery, like immediately after and then they give you this morphine button and every time you hit that bitch you just get just stoked up with morphine and it's amazing. You just sit. There you go, Woo. So the only time I've ever done quote unquote morphine, I've known, I've never experienced like opiates before. Other than that, and it was fucking wild. I was like, Ooh, good thing. This isn't available all the time, but we could easily get to a point sometime in the future where the idea of going on tinder to try to find someone to fuck is outrageously stupid. Why

Speaker 1:          02:13:31       would you do that when you can just like how you plug in your phone to recharge it. You're going to plug in and experiencing like the love of the mother Gaia, like, like the swarming fractal. Love that you get an a dmt experience, pure. Just pure pleasure and pure experience of, of just understanding and affection and all of it wrapped up in this warm, beautiful accepting, embrace or you know, I told you this and you went and did that, and then I was like, fuck you and you if I can, you might fucking cheap my friends. My friends tell me, you know, my friend Cheryl says, Nah, Nah, Nah, I don't want to do it anymore. You don't have to do it anymore. And then because of the fact that people kept doing this over and over and over again, our dicks has shrunk and shriveled up inside of our bodies.

Speaker 1:          02:14:23       And then we become those gray aliens. That's what we become. We ruin our atmosphere to the point where we have built in sunglasses, those big goddamn black eyes. Our heads become huge because we use telekinesis now. Uh, we don't want them to need muscles because we don't pick anything up anymore. And if you look at our muscles in comparison to a champ, you know, look at the, you've seen those photos are of chimps with mange hairless champs and like Jesus Christ will, they have to have muscles like that. It's how they get the trend is clear, you know, which way we're going. Great. He's just now is an opportunity to just really enjoy the shit out of it because they know because it's going to go, you know, I think at some point, and you know, I mean there will be some good aspects of that, you know, I think for sure there'll be generally some less suffering.

Speaker 1:          02:15:07       But this is if I had to choose what level of the video game I want to play, like I'm going to be here now. Yeah. This is, this is the cool time for me. And, and there are ways to do that. I mean, I think we think of it technologically, but I think at the plants as a technology, like smoking dmt is a technology. It's just a way to administer dmt molecules that don't get broken down immediately because there's such a flood that it actually crosses the blood brain barrier and you have that experience of swirling guy, you know, and it's just like looking at that like this is tech, this isn't, this is drugs, you know, this is technology. It's a weird word though. Technology, we think about metal. Yeah, we do wires. But really to me that's a better way to look at it, you know, because drugs carry all these connotations.

Speaker 1:          02:15:54       And I was at a cure for this. It's just this is a technology that allows this certain element of humanity to unlock. It's like a key to a lock and you hit that right. It's good. It's not. You don't always want to unlock all the doors either though, you know, I mean in my recent experience, I pushed it, pushed it to a level where I could really see like fuck. Like you could get down into some weird, weird waters where you're entering a lot, you know, and you don't really know if you're going to come back, you know, and, and so I, I definitely, I announced on my own podcast was like, look, I'm done with that

Speaker 2:          02:16:30       type of exploration of the plants. I just want to play, hang out and experience them for fun. But going intentionally that deep with them, you know, you have to be, you have to have caution. Plus it's a predatory universe out there. You know, a lot of these Iowaska shamans and a lot of these things, they don't always have your best interests. They come from the jungle where the strong eat the weak. That's what people gotta realize. Like in the jungle, the strongest Jaguar eats all things. All these Shamans, their head animal, most of moons. Toronto is the Jaguar who eats all things. Like you got to realize like a lot of those motherfuckers you're trying to eat you like they're trying to eat you. So be really super careful with it. But look at it, you know, without bias, look at it like this is a technology, is this technology going to be useful for me? Am I ready to explore this technology? If so, do it appropriately and responsibly and it can be really, really valuable. But then no one that technology's no longer serving you,

Speaker 3:          02:17:25       isn't it one of those things like we've been talking about where there's no, it's not a clear good or bad, there's not a clear yes or no. There's not like, oh, well if you meet a showman, he will absolutely be pure. No, fuck no, no, not at all. I mean there's just a mixed bag just like puke. It's like any human, is this going to be a good guy or bad guys can be someone's helpful or not helpful. That's why stereotypes are so fucking problematic. You know, if you meet a girl and she's beautiful, you assume she's dummy, right? You know what I mean? That's the standard, right? Because beautiful people don't have to try as hard as soon as she's taking it easy and she slacked off. It's just a lot of people meet these people from indigenous cultures and say, oh, they're indigenous. One Slash 16th, native American, spiritual, right? He's got extra magic and he's in medicine. Man's. He made the barefoot. He may just be trying to fuck everybody in his village and take your money.

Speaker 2:          02:18:21       Other people who are genuinely like Gandalf, the white wizard where you're like, fuck, that's Gandalf. The white wizard I just encountered and it's awesome, but it's just you got to use your instincts. You gotta be you gotTa. Be Keen to the situation and know what you're getting into because it's a. it's a crazy wild world that we know very little about compared to, you know, these external technology.

Speaker 3:          02:18:42       Well also the fact that it's been suppressed has become such a huge issue that we have to go to these South American countries to get it. It's not like, look, if you want to go to get a massage, you can go to Burke Williams and I guarantee you they will give you an excellent massage by a qualified technician. No one's going to fucking rob your wallet. You know what? They have established a business and an ethic. There's a lot of places like that where you go and you can, you know, you can go and experience a really good service because it's legal in because we don't, we don't. There's no consequences for engaging in that action, but the consequences of the United States are so extreme that people have to fly to the fucking jungle to take something that your own brain produces. It's. It's so weird. It's so weird that there's these destinations that you have to go to to explore that your

Speaker 1:          02:19:28       own fucking pineal gland produces, and the only reason why is because we make it illegal here in the United States. They should have calabasas IOWASCA centers. We should be able to go right down the street from Kim Kardashians House and get fucking fueled up, but we, we, we're not there yet and if who knows what we're ever going to get there. It seems to me though that that's the trend it seems. Yeah, right. Definitely in so many different ways. There's all these ponies in the race. I was pretty much there with a religious exemption, like was that church that just opened up in Washington? Don't recommend it. From what I've seen, obviously haven't been there, but again, there's a very select group that I. What is the church in Washington? What is there? It's a nondenominational IOWASCA church. So the Church has Santa Diamond. That church of UDV. I'm already got religious exemption approval cream court by the supreme court twice.

Speaker 1:          02:20:16       Yeah, right. So one more time and you know, it's fully like everything is going to be a good. They're doing full Iowa. Rick Strassman Ios. Rick strassman did it with them and he's like, they were these golf shirts like they have like a little outfit and they're getting blasted with like insanely powerful IOWASCA and they're singing songs about Jesus. Then that's the weird part. So I'll sing songs about Jesus if you get me high enough. So then the church in Washington was like, fuck it, we're going to be nondenominational so we're not going to sing songs about Jesus, we're just going to be a church. And so we're waiting to kind of see what happens with that. But that's, that's already coming and then psilocybin is coming for approval as medicine, you know, Johns Hopkins is doing amazing research on that for both palliative care and a variety of other thing.

Speaker 1:          02:21:04       MTMA for posttraumatic stress is coming online. Marijuana, just by sheer sensibility and numbers is going to be legal at some point. So like all of these ponies are in the race and I think they're all going to come to fruition somewhere in the next five, 10 years, while also the information that the Internet is providing. Totally. You can go online today and find all the different things that marijuana is good at and then find out the fact that it's a schedule one drug, the United States of America and you go, oh well, whoever's making the schedules a criminal and it's real simple. You've got this plant that you can eat, you could eat, you could use it to make a fuel for a lamp. He could build a fucking house out of it. Like you can make clothes with it, you can make paper with it. You can essentially make everything with it.

Speaker 1:          02:21:48       You need to get a hemp stock, you need to get a piece like, I'm going gonna, I'm going to order you one. We'll get some. If it is a tree grows large, it gets fat like like a forearm and it weighs nothing and it's hard as a rock. It's fucking alien. It's so weird. It's not like any other plant that exists on earth. It's so strange, but these laws that are in place, we're all in place. Back when information was difficult to come by back when you had to get it through these selected media sources like newspapers or television shows and everybody was confused. Everybody was worried they were going to go crazy like reefer madness and jump off a building or stab white women

Speaker 3:          02:22:26       when nobody knew they they didn't know, and now we do know. So now that we do know those, those nonsensical non reality based perceptions are eroding their roading right before our eyes. In the line of it is things like podcasts. A lot of his things like Ted talks, lectures, people explaining the actual reality of it, information, social media, stories that are being printed in online media sources where they explain like the actual effects of these drugs that John Hopkins studies where you can, you can read in New York Times the benefits of Psilocybin for people who are experiencing the the end of life relieving of pressure of people that are terrified about dying. People who have had some serious traumatic abuse in their life and their being cured of the burden of that with psychedelic medicines and it's bizarre. It's bizarre the time that we live in and that all these things are sort of sprouting out of the earth.

Speaker 3:          02:23:31       They've been suppressed and stuffed into the ground by these people that were essentially the enemies of information that they were distributing false information, suppressing the real information. I mean Nixon was the enemy of information because he sponsored these studies to show how bad marijuana was and when it turned out, the marijuana is actually not bad at all. They suppress that information. He's actually the enemy of data. He'll like push that data down into the ground and never released it, but now it's just just through sheer truth is popping through the earth and you're seeing Colorado experiencing record revenues and taxes and when that happens, then all the evil people who quote unquote the people that are concentrating solely on numbers on money now they're involved because you're talking about a state in Colorado that's made more money from taxes from marijuana than they did from alcohol last year, which is fucking insane.

Speaker 3:          02:24:33       But Tulsa Pot people don't mind paying 39 percent taxes if you make it legal because then what's the joint? Seven bucks instead of five. Fuck it. Let's do it. Yeah. No, seven bucks. And your blast that off your head for like the next 10 hours. Do you understand like how much drinking costs? You know if you get a drink at a bar, like what is. I don't even know what a drink cost. 10 Bucks. Okay. So what? Two drinks? 20 bucks. 20 bucks worth of pot will fuck you up for a week. You get 20 bucks worth of marijuana. Like if you, you can smoke like three hits a day for four or five days in a row on 20 bucks worth of weed. Yeah, no doubt. I mean it's, it's a chronicle, it's economical and it's inescapable now. Like they've let the, the, that oppression can only work when it's tight. When you start to like the

Speaker 2:          02:25:24       plants growing up through the concrete, the concrete starts to break off and all of a sudden it returns the jungle again. You can't, you can't keep this stuff down. And I was actually, I had dinner with the maps people at my house, a little charity dinner and they presented some of the new data that was coming out from their recent study on Mtma. Unbelievable results for treating PTSD. So to give it like a quick summary, posttraumatic stress has a scale and the scale goes from zero to 1:30. One 30 is like the most incomprehensible amount of terrible shit that's happened to you possible lived in a cage your whole life, whatever. Tortured forever. Most people have a certain amount, like five of skift score of five or 10. There's always been bad shit that's happened to people, but like the threshold is somewhere around 50.

Speaker 2:          02:26:07       Oh, anything over 50 year actually diagnosable with ptsd and in the kind of medical record as far as I understand it. And so in their recent studies, you know, they're getting an average of people with treatment resistant ptsd. That means the drugs didn't work and what the drugs showed and it's a combination of, I believe Paxil and Zoloft with the drug showed is they were able with consistent application to reduce that score like six to 10 points, so from like 70 to 60, so still pretty fucked up. You're not down like in the normal range, which is somewhere around 10, reduced it from 70 to 60. With the MTMA assisted psychotherapy, there's three sessions, you know, where they took Mtma three times with a therapist and it reduced it like 50 points and not only did it reduce it 50 points instead of 10, it continued to drop over the next three years that they observe them without any utilization of mdms.

Speaker 2:          02:27:01       So it's like instead of this, this constant treatment, there's a cure potentially out there. That's available where three times you do this thing and of course you know the psychotherapy isn't to be ignored. That's an important part of this. It's Mtma assisted psychotherapy, not just willy nilly taking the drugs and hold someone that guide you and guiding you through into these situations and it's amazingly powerful and this is a disease that affects or disorder rather, that affects so many millions of people who are suffering and you just have something there on the fringe with this data coming out and pretty soon it becomes incredibly unethical to keep this illegal when the data is showing that much promise. Like any other pharmaceutical drug that could be patentable, that showed that much promise and doing something fast tracked. I mean it would be like like that a act drug which ended up not working, but when everybody's afraid of aids and like this may work, all of a sudden that shit was legal in like six months because people were freaked out. I mean that's what should happen with Mgma and we'll see if it does. You know, because when this data is presented, it's going to be such a convincing case. It really becomes unethical not to use it.

Speaker 3:          02:28:07       Well, I think we're also in a world now where children are growing up and they're growing up from the time they're a baby. They have access to the Internet and the culture that exists today is so radically than the culture pre 1994 that the children that are born in 1994 have now they have. They're 20 years old, you know now they're adults and they've grown up with the Internet from the time they were babies. Those are the people that are just not going to accept the laws that are in place as they get older and they become leaders and politicians and they're going to have a completely different idea than some of these old wacky fucks that are just they. They're operating on a false paradigm they're operating with, with bad information and they're the what, what, what's undeniable. It's concrete and solid to them just isn't, well, bull drugs are bad and it's bad for your brain.

Speaker 3:          02:29:06       Like, I had a conversation with Michio Kaku once when I was on the opiod, Anthony Show when I was asking him about, uh, about psychedelic drugs. I forgot what I was asking them about, but, uh, it was like, well, we know scientists, we're trying to expand our brain. We don't want to give ourselves brain damage. I gave this idea that you would ruin your brain by doing mushrooms. Like, Oh, well, you've never done mushrooms, right? Have you ever done mushrooms? No, I wouldn't do it because I don't want to ruin my brain. I want to expand my. And I was like, well, you don't understand what you're saying that you're, you're talking about something that you don't, you've never experienced. So you have this idea in your head that it's bad for you based on what? Based on propaganda. But then I realized, well, he's in academia, being an academia, purdue, you know, uh, doing lectures, do you use it, would radically limit his income, radically limit his exposure if he came out and started saying, you know, hey, I'm, I'm really in favor of people trying drugs and going to the jungle and fucking hanging out with barefoot dudes or giving you some toxic frog poison makes away from that one.

Speaker 3:          02:30:11       I've done a lot of things and that was definitely not one that you want to do the Kambo poison. But yeah, I mean the psilocybin has been shown to have neurogenesis help rebuild the brain and neurons like what? Yeah, that's some crazy shit. And you know, if you've experienced DMT, either an Iowaska or smokable form, you know, a lot of times it feels like there's a thousand little doctors like soldering and fixing shit in your brain. You're like, oh well the end. It was nice. The end of my trips always feel like, like almost like, you know, if like if you went theoretically because we've never done this, could go to a massage parlor and get a hand release. Like they actually rubbed you down first and they go, all right, now let's take care of the problem. Um, will dmt feels like you have this wild exploratory trip. And then the end of it to me always feels like they're like, all right, well we got to do some maintenance. So just kick back and look at the pretty lights were done showing you shit. We're just going to, we're going to go deep there and just try to correct some shit. Yeah. You hear the, you hear in the Eco rose the IOWASCA songs. We'll often talk to Dr Ceto, you know, Dr Ceto his little doctor. And so it's like, it's a paradigm exists in

Speaker 1:          02:31:19       many cultures and you can feel it independently, you know, like I was feeling that before I realized like, Oh, Dr c dot a little doctor, you know, that's what they're, that's what they're talking about. His little doctor come here, you, you know, and that's what they're singing to the plants. These, these medicines will. There's so many people that are dealing with traumatic brain injuries these days. How fascinating would it be if it found out if they found out or it could prove that siliciden could alleviate the problems with traumatic brain injury by regenerating tissue, but actually healing the brain? I mean, maybe it's not where that is right now. I mean maybe it hasn't gotten to a stage, but between that stem cell treatments and all sorts of different ways. There's so many people like when you lose the ability to see reality correctly because your brain's not functioning like either.

Speaker 1:          02:32:06       You're very Oregon. It's like having a television that just doesn't get a good signal anymore. It's all fucked up. Well, it's got to be fixed, right, but we can't fix it. Like right now, the brain has a very limited ability to fix itself and there are some strategies and some different treatments that they use to help people recover from traumatic brain injuries and get to some semblance of normalcy. But imagine if they got to a point where they found out that this neurogenesis capability that we've shown to exist in silicide and can actually rebuild tissue and heal brain and run proper studies like you would with any other supplementary thing out. They're like, all right, well let's try a micro dose for over the course of two months. You know, like a sub detectable where you're not like tripping your balls, but just something like you would a nutritional supplement.

Speaker 1:          02:32:51       Let's test that over against placebo for two months and then measure the results in the brain. Well, the suppression has just eliminated that option for science to just explore these hypotheses. Like what happens if you microdose dmt in some form over the course of two months? Like how does that affect performance? And a lot of people are doing that now. They're microdosing on their own and anecdotally reporting something. But what we need is a placebo controlled trial to say like unequivocably, Oh yeah, that's what this does. But it's so hard to get that shit approved and get the approval material and get this done that it's. It's become challenging. But when that lids off, it's going to be really, really fucking cool. I agree that this is the coolest time to be alive. It really is an an amazing, fascinating time to be alive. But I wonder if they're going to look back at us the way we look at champs. You know, lily's fucking dummies. They thought that was an awesome time to be alive.

Speaker 1:          02:33:48       I wonder. I wonder if people always have that way of looking at things where they just appreciate what's around them and say, wow, this is as good as it's ever been. This is amazing. But then one day they'll look back at us and go with how ridiculous they couldn't even read minds. Imagine going through life not being able to read minds like what a shitty way to live. Sort of how we look at people that can't send emails. They didn't even have the Internet. You had to go to a library and read a book that was written hand. Like

Speaker 3:          02:34:18       some guy wrote the a pen. He had a feather, a dip it in some coal that they mixed with oil or whatever the fuck they use to make ink. Yeah. We're going to probably look back at that someday and maybe even in our lifetimes. But I bet there's also those people who if you took them from the past like let's say, you know, you talked to him Musashi and you're like, there's an awesome future, but you can't use your sword to cut anybody. He'd be like, fuck, I think I'm good. You know, it's like we got all this cool shit. We got computers and knowledge and you know, all these different things. Travel the world. We have drones. You don't even have to be involved and just have to be like in another room somewhere else. He's not going to be into that. So much is just holding the steel in his hand and just that's got to meet and so in every age there's these parts of that age that are irreplaceable.

Speaker 3:          02:35:08       I was in Vegas yesterday leaving the airport early in the morning and you know, you're waiting in line at the security thing to show your id and I looked up and they had a screen that was giving instructions and guidelines for using drones and I was like, Jesus Christ, we're living in the future. Like it, it, it almost. I was waiting for it to be a joke because if you ever gone through the Las Vegas airport, they have these big screens up and they'll show these sort of humorous character sketches. Yeah. Carrot top. Trying to carry all his props through the security and showing what you can't do. They have these heavy metal guys that are taking off these giant spiked risk bracelets and you know what you have to like take off to go through security and so on. The same screen where they show that they showed this thing about drones and I was like, this seems like some starship troopers.

Speaker 3:          02:35:58       Shit. It seems like it doesn't seem real, but it was real. They were talking about the Federal Aviation Administration and the guidelines and rules for using drones. Don't let your drone get out of sight. Don't make your drone go over a certain amount of feet in the air. Don't let your drone wandered near airports. Don't let your drone get involved in the path of commercial flights. I was like, wow, this is. Please use your drone responsibly. And I'm like, whoa. This is bizarre. Yeah, like demolition man. Weird future shit girl. You see the drone that I almost dropped on that skier? No. Jamie tried to find that there was a drone that drops out of the sky and almost completely obliterate ran out of gas or something. Ran Out of fucking signal or something like. And Paul's like right on the heels of his skis. It's wasn't the guy who was piloting it? No, he was. He was like, it was an actual competition. So he's skiing ski racer. Watch this. Oh my God. Oh Jesus Christ. Hold on back that up again. Oh my God. Slowmo.

Speaker 3:          02:37:06       Tom. That's insane. That want to fuck that dude. I'm fucked him up for sure. Wow. I wonder if that was like a person in the audience that wanted to get like a good video of it or whether that was the real camera crew. It's weird. Well, there's a thing going on right now where there's new technology that they haven't had the ability to form the proper regulations for yet and they're not really aware of like what the issues are like those Goddamn hoverboards, those things like you see people at the airport, at least they were for awhile. I think they're trying to make that illegal where they're at the airport and they're wandering through the terminals on these hoverboards just scooting along on these. These, if you don't know what a hoverboard is, it's essentially like a surf or it's like a skateboard, but instead of going sideways, like the way you skate, you go forward.

Speaker 3:          02:37:57       Like, uh, it's so it's perpendicular and there's wheels on it and the wheels are like those, uh, those. What are those things called? The fucking. The, the segway. The segway. Thank you. It's a gyroscope and the gyroscopes sort of balances you out and you roll around. They're fun. My kids have them. I ride them around the house, they're really fun, but now they're starting to have regulations like they're starting to say, hey, you can't ride these things on the sidewalks. You can't. Okay, now we're making rules because those rules didn't exist before. And people like, remember when the Wiz Khalifa got arrested at the airport, he got arrested the airport because he wouldn't get off of it. Really Monitor to around probably highest fuck tattoos on his face and he doesn't give a fuck about a hoverboard and you know, they arrested him for it. That doesn't help street credit actually when you get arrested for robbery, I mean there's a lot of arrests that might help a rapper, but that's maybe not.

Speaker 3:          02:38:48       Anytime a wrapper gets arrested, it's good because the thing is they complain. These niggas don't know. I don't know if you should be allowed to do it, but I do know when you do do it, if you know what you're doing, like very precise with it. I mean, it's not an issue, but I think people have the idea, the, the issue is it's automated and you can potentially like, like uh, my daughter I had a slower down and like settle down, settle. She's fucking whizzing around in this thing like really fast and she's wiped out a couple of times. Like she kinda crazy and she's wiped out and hurt herself and I'm like just going to just a little too fast and shark, she's getting to the edge of the ability to control the thing. And if someone was doing that in an airport, it could be a real problem between those and drones.

Speaker 3:          02:39:34       Like these emerging technologies that we don't necessarily have regulations for yet. And I think there's so many people that are so fragile and they get so scared, you know, like they can't, they haven't kept up with their body so they can't get out of the way if some shit happened or like if they did get hit, they're going to break for sure. Like in Santa Monica, that happens all the time. We'll be riding our bikes around and we'll pass them old people and they'll just curse us. We're not even close. Yeah. Like on the bikes, we miss them by six feet. Yeah. Like fuck. Because they know they're just in this kind of like fragile state and so they kind of panic when there's something on wheels rolling by. They don't really

Speaker 1:          02:40:14       understand them. Crackers there are made out of crackers. They fall down. It's a wrap. It's over. Everything over. Imagine a wiping out on an old lady with a bike. If you're whipping along on a mountain bike and you collided with an 80 year old lady, he would just shatter her whole body. Everything would just snap. Crackle. They can't fall down like you can't fall down. Imagine you're. Your body gets to a place where you cannot fall down if you fall down. Everything breaks. Yeah. That's not a future that I'm hoping for. Yeah. I mean fuck. I wonder how much that can be mitigated by strength training. A lot. Training and mineralization, you know, keeping their bone density up, making sure that you have the spare parts to replace the ones that you're losing, you know, I think that's, you know, a big part of it.

Speaker 1:          02:41:03       Getting the muscles on the frame and then supporting the bones and making sure that your body is sturdy enough because you see the other way if you see these people is just sturdy is shit and all different cultures. Cultures that don't have medicines and pharmaceuticals. Like even in the jungle again, you'll see somebody 75 with a machete, just kicking ass macho, big cigarette coming out of his mouth. Just ha ha. And then drinks beers at the end of the day. You know, like if you stay that vigorous and active, you can, you know, and eating very natural foods. Obviously they don't have another choice and a lot of those cases you can see the other side and then you can see this kind of this other amalgamation which is gary where you got cracker bones. Yeah, that's more, that's another benefit of being able to do the work. Being able to force yourself to do some things you don't want to do as far as that like exercise and pushing yourself.

Speaker 1:          02:41:55       The benefits of that are you have a body that works way better for way longer, and if you don't do that, you get deterioration and you get atrophy and then you become frail. You become that old person. It's screaming at you because you're on a bike 10 feet away from them. You can kill me. Cracker bones. Yeah, exactly. It's a bummer, man. It's a bummer. That's a. that's another inevitable bummer about life, but it's also isn't that part of what's beautiful about this is that you can't be that girl with the picks and the instagram forever, like why the butt pics are so exciting is because that but only exists for about 20 years or so. We'll start falling blossoms perfectly right before it falls off into nothing. You know? That was the great symbol for the Samurai was. That's why they appreciated it because it flowers and beauty and then falls.

Speaker 1:          02:42:42       That's life time. Time will rip US clutching and grabbing from every attachment that we have. It always wins. It's like someone in Jujitsu with the ultimate squeeze that never gets tired like we're going to have to tap out at some point of everything that we love. Everything that we like, so might as well just accept that like it's cool. Enjoy it while it's here and in a fractal sense. Even if you can live forever, the fucking planet will be here forever, right? The Sun will burn out, the sun is going to run out of energy and it's going to eventually supernova. Good luck. You can't live forever. There is no forever. It doesn't exist. Time always wins. That time is a motherfucker know. It is such a motherfucker. I wrote this piece for Maxim magazine about how the human body's like sand castle. That's one of the cool things about a sand castle as you're building it and one of the beautiful things about, as you know, it's not gonna last.

Speaker 1:          02:43:37       If you made a sand castle out of cement, nobody would be impressed. So something about a sandcastle where you, you've put all this work into it with the understanding that this is entirely temporary and that's sort of the same thing with a human body and I was comparing old Arnold Schwartzenegger from the seventies to the Arnold Schwartzenegger now with the dad bod when you see them now and his little skivvies on the beach. Like Whoa, what the fuck man, that's the tide is started to come in, you know, and that ocean spray is washing away the towers and washing away everything until eventually there's only the memory and the pictures of that sand castle as it was. And that is fucking beautiful. Like it's not something to be lamented, like appreciate that shit. Like it's temporary. So we fucking love it. Yup. You know like that's, that's a part of the thing.

Speaker 1:          02:44:22       Yeah. It's one of the more fascinating aspects about at all is that it is temporary and I think that if it wasn't, if everything, it's like the way I described it in the article was like if you, if it. That wasn't the case. It would be like as boring as playing a video game on God mode. Never play a quake on God mode. You can type quake used to be, you could, uh, go to hit the [inaudible] key and go into the command prompt and you can, uh, you could type in God and you would play on God mode. In God mode is you were in vulnerable. Your life would last forever. It all the weapons you wanted and you couldn't get hurt. She just run around shooting things and as boring as fuck and no consequences and not worrying at all about your own mortality.

Speaker 1:          02:45:05       That would, it wouldn't be fun. Like one of the fun things about doing wild shit is you know you're going to have to sleep. You know, one of the fun things about sex is you know what's going to end. You know, it's hard to get when you get it. You know, I can't leave her fucking and then it's over. Then your tie. One of the fun things about dragon is a god damn, we're going to pay for this. It's, it's part of the whole thing is it is the Yin and Yang. It is the struggle. It is, it's the, the, the consequences and it's the reward and it's all together. Yeah. It's the coolest fucking video game that we all made together, man. I'm telling you, that's really what it is. And we were born into it, born into it, and then we just get to decide how we want to play, you know, decide if we want to level up, decide if we want to retreat. We can ultimately decide if we want to hit the reset button, but if we hit that reset button, you know, and end this game right now, we'll never get to play this turn again. You know, when, then we get to be this person at this time on this planet. I can't say never, but holds likely. Most likely. You never get to do a Redo of this exact thing. Maybe something similar, but so what are you missing out on? You're missing out on a unique

Speaker 2:          02:46:10       opportunity to experience something totally unique in that sense. And so it's a real shame to do it, but I think, you know, I think taking some of the pressure off that situation like, oh okay, some people may want to hit that reset button because shit sucks and that's lamentable and it's an unfortunate situation because of those things that I mentioned, but in my worldview that is just hitting the reset button on the game and you get a chance to play, you know, some other time

Speaker 3:          02:46:36       or you come back as well as poisonous frog is in Topanga Canyon and fuck people up. That would be a motherfucker. I mean, you know, with this idea that we always that reincarnation, you always come back as a person. Imagine if not, imagine if you will, like you become a person, a person. Is that top of the food chain ideally. Right? All right. So when you come back, you come back as an Amoeba and you've got to go through the whole process again. You had dies an Amoeba, you come back as a multicell organism, you die, you come back as a slug, death come back as a frog. Death come back as a bird death. You're a dog death, you're a chicken death death, you go, it doesn't know, time doesn't give a fuck no, and then there's multiple dimensions and infinite universes. Now you just keep coming back as new things, new things on other planets, new biological creatures that we haven't even begun to discover, like the idea that if you live and die, you only live in dying.

Speaker 3:          02:47:33       This one patch of dirt and that your soul, if that's a real thing, your consciousness, your entity, your essence only transcends this body and enters into another one like it. You know, in past life who queen or lived in new people were fucking presidents or kings like every motherfucker. It was a president or a king in the past, a homeless person sucking dick for homemade wine and all the fucking. All the Gypsies are telling you that Shit. She's like, Oh yes, I see you at a great general like, motherfucker, come on, come on. How about I was a loser? I would like to elucidate. Or Julius Caesar, the 7,000 Julius Caesar's from fucking fortunate. Oh, I see you. It was great. Caesar leading the Roman as well. People love this. Love that whole nostalgia. I was listening to this one, uh, African American dude. It was talking about.

Speaker 3:          02:48:22       He was talking about the history of black people. It's like we were kings. That's what he said. Like, okay, somebody needs to talk to you because you can't. Everybody can't be kings. Do Kings work. First of all, kings are assholes and if you were a king back then most likely fucking killed. A bunch of people were enslaving a bunch of motherfuckers. Exactly. This idea, we worked things like how many, how many of you were kings? Did you go, I'll get along. Did y'all have separate kingdoms? Did you all live in a community of kingdoms? Like what the fuck he talking about Jesus Christ in the past? No, we would love that. We'd love to. I will. I'm really curious about that. Like this longing for nostalgia. Like what is that? What people want to look to the past? And you know, I dated this girl a long time ago and she was brutal in the fact that she always distorted

Speaker 1:          02:49:08       the past and made, it sounds so amazing and so incredible. And so, you know, like what you grew up in a broken home. Your parents were abusive, alcoholic, so was like, you know, when we're together, the love was amazing and they were always together and they always know they weren't, they fought, they threw glasses at each other like Jesus Christ. Will you look at the life as what it actually is in gain those possible lessons from the actual truth of the life instead of this romantic fucking movie, this strange reese witherspoon movie of life. Like somehow, like people feel like they need that, who they are. It's built into like their own pride in themselves having this thing. But yeah, just strip all that shit away. I mean, I think that the ego that wants all of these things, once that passed and once this, you got to just strip that little tyrant and just like take all that armor off, take all the bullshit off and let it stand naked in the light of truth.

Speaker 1:          02:50:07       Just naked as shit out there. Like, you know, get real, get real with the elements. I think it has something to do with movies too, man. I think it has something to do with literature and it's something to do with our, our creation of a narrative like our creation of these uh, these lives that we read about and watching films and we sort of apply them to our database of what's possible. And then, you know, you sort of like look back on some movie that you saw that was wonderful and it was amazing, you know, some really silly movie and you apply that to your own past and you sort of like trying to twist things around. Especially when you're describing them to other people. You want people to think you had the most amazing life but it never works. It's sort of like name dropping, like name dropping has the opposite effect, like it doesn't work, like the idea that you are going to somehow or another make people like you more because you know, you know Harry Belafonte or someone.

Speaker 1:          02:51:08       I don't know why I said Harold Bell, where the fuck that came from? Leonardo Dicaprio. Really good friends with Leo. You know, we go to bars that you immediately think that guy's a douche bag. People assume that this, the machinations behind what they're saying are completely transparent, but they're not like people. Some people are blind to it and ignorant and that's when name dropping work. Like oh my God, you're know Leo, Blah Blah, and they're just operating on that short hamster wheel that's running full speed and they can't figure out that he's has some other compulsion that's causing them to do this. But then you meet somebody who has a little bit of that, you know, wherewithal and it's just gross. Like, Ugh, what are you doing? I see what you're trying to do. That I see these hidden motivations and I think that's kind of what we're seeing in politics.

Speaker 1:          02:51:52       We're seeing across the board, it's like, you know, and so many different little gimmicks that people play, like even them saying when I'm president of the, they don't fucking believe that when fucking Jeb Bush, when present, he doesn't believe it, and you can tell you're like our bullshit belief detectors. Know that when he's saying he doesn't believe it, but you know who does believe it when conor mcgregor says when they clash them and I'm not gonna fucking head off he fuck it believes it was Scottish. He just fucked up the Irish accent. Irish accents. Tough do. Yeah. He definitely. Well, he in that, that you know, that limited world of interacting with bones and flesh and technique. Yeah. He, he understands it to the point where he really believes it and says it and I think although probably believed it too and some sort of fucked up way believed him.

Speaker 1:          02:52:40       Yeah. Yeah. I think that's one of the things I think when anybody's fighting, it's not only a test of their physicality, it's like a test of their belief and all of that squaring off and all of the stare downs. It's like, how much do you believe you're going to beat me? You know, and most people probably. Great champions, they're in that 98. They're pretty confident. Connor just shows up straight. A hundred hundred like denial. Like you sure you sure? Congress like, yeah, I'm fucking my favorite quotes of Connor. And he goes, I'm number one. He goes, number one, do you think like when they were replaced, Chad Mendez replaced Josie Aldo. He goes, I'm number one. Do you think number one gives a fuck who number two? And number three is, let them all come. Let them. Oh, that was a bad Irish accent to. That was pretty good actually. I thought it was bad. Fell in west La, had deteriorated in the Middle Eastern. Somewhere in the middle of it. We're out of time, man. We just banged out three hours. Beautiful. Believe it or not, I don't know how that happened. That's the wonders of conversation or my brother. Always. Good. Good time. Definitely. We're out of time. You fuckers, but we'll be back tomorrow. So, uh, thanks. Happy New Year. Yeah, I love you all. Love you all. Bye.
