Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Already nailing it, bitches not even turned on the Joe Rogan experience podcast,

Speaker 2:          00:00:08       brought to you by the flashlight. If you go to Joe Rogan.net and click on the link to the flashlight. I'm trying to do this and I'm trying to tweet at the same time. This is unprofessional. If you go to Joe Rogan.net and click on the link and enter in the code named Rogan, you'll get 15 percent off the number one sex toy for men and Doug Benson. If you want one. I have extras. I have one for you. It's got your name right.

Speaker 1:          00:00:31       Did I tell you what my slogan I came up with for the fleshlight? No. Fuck those things. Oh, I get, that's good sample.

Speaker 2:          00:00:39       It's clean. I like, I liked the way you think. Um, if you enter in the code name, Rogan, you get 15 percent off. And Brian, how many of you?

Speaker 1:          00:00:49       I uh, I haven't fucked one until recently. I just went back to fucking one and it was nice. It was nice. I don't know why I took the vacation because I went for awhile. I was spitting up my hands, making myself have yeast infections and all this shit. It don't use spit after eating. Wait a minute. You've made yourself have a use and I think I did. I think I. I think some mashed potatoes in your hand are so lazy with my lotion. So nasty. You are so nasty. He spit in your hand. You gave yourself a yeast infection on your. Yeah. Wow. From too much breadsticks anyway. Don't do what he does and clean your flashlight too. Don't be disgusting. No problem. With like cantaloupes recently where people were dying from like bad cantaloupes, there were fucking bad cantaloupes from eating them, but then I was just wondering, I was going to extrapolate like what will happen if you fucked up bad cantaloupe.

Speaker 1:          00:01:40       No kidding. Right? Because Cantaloupe is probably the nature's backup to the fleshlight, right? How many different people do you think? How many? What are the numbers of people that are fucked? Cantaloupes? I think there's bit. When you're young, you would try anything. I mean I fucked pillows and then I sleep on it, you know, so it's like hump things. They'll get elaborate if you want to carve a correct size hole into a piece of fruit. I, just out of curiosity, how many people do you think of fucked cantaloupes? Cantaloupe? I would say at least two out of 10 people and I'm like all time numbers as it a million, half a million people. Fifty three, 53. We've gone through it, you know, I mean a lot of people have probably looked at the cantaloupe and they were drunk and fuck it, fuck that. And maybe look for an apple core.

Speaker 1:          00:02:27       Couldn't find it or tried to make a whole circular hole with a knife and it didn't work out. And they're like, ah, fuck it. But how many people actually went ahead? Fucked it and came inside the cantaloupe. I want the numbers. I'm biased because I have. So I think everyone has, you know, you shut a load into account. I remember I put it in the microwave and. Oh, that's right. Nice and hot. I always used heat too. I always, when I think about masturbating, I have to have heat involved, but I don't like to live in Ohio. It was freezing all the time. Have you ever fucked a girl by mistake by using the back oil you put on back? That heats up. You accidentally use it for lube to fuck a girl in the ass. Don't do that.

Speaker 1:          00:03:07       Ruins it, and they run to the bathroom crying and my goodness so that, that hot oil lotions just for your bag. Don't put it in an asshole. Don't tell me that. This is a real story. It's super real. I've done it multiple times, but I say, you know, it's supposedly really nasty is a. If you fill the tub with champagne, if a lady gets into it, it would just burn the shit out of her. A tutor out over stuff. Wow. That's. That supposedly happened in Natalie Wood one time. Oh, that's funny. I think. I think Dennis Hopper used to tell this story. I bet it's happening. A lot of hood parties. You know what I'm saying?

Speaker 1:          00:03:50       Come on like you don't think Birdman has parties, whereas bathtubs full of champagne and checks and just climbing in and and booty poppin inside the tub filled the champion. Of course they are. Of course, we're telling you those girls ladies, get your kutuchief chucked out, get some anti yeast infection type situation going there. That's dangerous stuff. Martinelli's, sparkling apple. Do you think that that would probably burn also? Maybe that would like not burn because it's not alcoholic, right? Maybe picking everything up. Maybe it would just make everything smell nice. Oh, I like that taste. Maybe it would be good. It could be a positive and it's just apple cider, right? Anyway, that's the fleshlight commercial and go get yourself a flashlight. They're awesome. To beat on a lot of controversy on this new commercials. Joe. Yeah. They go fuck themselves. Controversy. I just. A lot of people have been tweeting me and I didn't know what to tell you.

Speaker 1:          00:04:45       It's like, you know, chill the fuck out. Commercials took so long. It's not really commercial, dude. It's a commercial doing. Every time. Every one of them is organic. Every one of them was just us fucking around. We got it out of the way. It's the best way to do a commercial folks. It's really not that big a deal. I didn't even know we were doing a commercial pre show chat. It's fucking entertaining. Goddammit. Relax everybody. It's like what we're trying to do. Basically just slipping in real quick on you. What? Come on. Just let me get. Was it a big deal? Can I do a five second commercial? Can you recommend somebody? Somebody made a funny website search like Brian Dot com. It's hilarious. Use it for your search needs. It's pretty awesome. As a butthole to every search. He adds the word butthole every time he searched his things, so it was like, what do you think it would be like to live in New Orleans? Let's see. It will once, but whole wells fargo locations, butthole and it always adds one extra bottle to all your searches that change the ultimate. No, you still get mixed in for fun. You just, if you get to page 1000, 199, you might see something fucked up.

Speaker 3:          00:05:58       Old Dude name Wells Fargo who bent over showing. You know, it's funny how that goat see thing. That guy pulling apart his asshole. Yeah, data is the Internet man. You know, there's a photo, um, I forget somebody, you know, was one of those memes and it was a kid that was a horrified. It was photoshop obviously and right in front of this kid's face was the goats. He asshole. And it just said, welcome to the Internet. I mean, if you could pick one image that represents the Internet for me, it's the goats. He asshole guy, the guy pulling apart his asshole that represents the internet to make is. Guess what? There's no way that it should be that easy to find. No way you should ever be one click away from a guy just opening his asshole. Just pulling it apart like a chew toy, you know, there's no fucking way that should be one click away. That is the Internet that embodies the Internet. That is the potential of the Internet. It's not the whole Internet, but it's a good. It's one particular hole. It's a good tee shirt for the band.

Speaker 3:          00:07:07       I mean Fuck Dude, uh, we are also sponsored by it on it.com, o n n I t. and if you go to a on a.com, we sell our Alpha brain, which is a cognitive enhancer and new mood, which is a five htp, a formulation that has five htp and l trip to fan in it. And it, um, it's, it really makes you feel awesome. So if you've been trying. And I liked it, I like it a lot. Five htp is the shit man. And if you don't want, don't even forget about what we're selling. Go go buy it from some, you know, a GNC or local, you know, local store tryouts and five HDP. That shit feels good or buying in an alley. Try to try to buy from a dealer. You don't have to buy our stuff. It just, you know, the, the idea of nootropics, just because I'm selling nootropics on the show, don't you?

Speaker 3:          00:07:56       Don't buy my shit. You go buy it from somewhere else. Go read like what nootropics are all about online and you know, and try it. It might not work for you, might work for you. For some people there's, every body is different biologically I think. And I think stuff that might work for you, it's not necessarily gonna work for me. Goodbye. When time instead. I mean there's some people that can't deal with caffeine. Some people. I mean I don't, I don't know if it's gonna work for you, but for me it wasn't my thing, but I still try it, you know, you never know. Are you a caffeine guy? No, I'm saying it's not at all. I, I'm completely off of caffeine, but I can have it every once in a while for, you know, for. Do you not go with caffeine because caffeine kills your boss. That's a good point. No, no. I'll have like a, you know, of like a fancy, like this time of year I'll like to have like a Pumpkin latte every once in a while or something. But I don't, I don't really. I just not a coffee person, but I'm more specifically not a diet diet soda person anymore.

Speaker 1:          00:08:56       I got totally off of that. Have you ever tried energy drinks or do you stay away from all that? Yeah, I just go with, you know, whatever your natural. When I'm tired, that's time to go to bed. It's probably a smart way. I'm usually not in a position where I have to force myself to stay up, you know? And so he's sort of keeps me, you know, if it's a sativa, it sort of keeps me up anyway. So you just avoid all stimulants pretty well. I drink alcohol, so. Yeah. That's a depressant though, right? Yeah, yeah. Yeah. But I mean just in terms of. Have you ever fuck with that are wrong? No, no, no, no. I don't. I haven't really haven't fucked with much. I've only done mushrooms a few times and he a couple of times and that's about it. I'm mostly just pot and alcohol. A lot of people love that.

Speaker 1:          00:09:42       Adderall man. A lot of people loved that for getting shit done. I think if I could get a supply of it, I would probably take it away. Yeah, but not even going to look. How damaging do you think it is for you? I don't think it's bad. I think I know. I think if you use it in moderation, I think it seems like it's one of those that's kind of hard to use in moderation leg it a lot. I think Brian's the kind of guy that like, like for me, if I like masturbate, it's usually like I can go to sleep right after that, but I, I imagined Brian underwood masturbate and then want to stay up late enough to be able to masturbate again. Probably like you get bummed out that it makes you sleepy and so you need so you need some sort of energy thing to power through to the next one. Yeah. I

Speaker 2:          00:10:25       want you to try something. Life is short. I want you to try this Alpha brain shit right now. No, no. I'll give it to you after the show, but what? What's it gonna do to me? It's, it just the way it helps me. It makes me feel like my brain works better. It makes me feel cleaner, like have a little bit more energy, a little bit more like it feels like things are firing better, you know? It's, there's a bunch of different interesting ingredients in it. All of them have been used by people for hundreds, if not thousands of years. And it's uh, it's basically vitamins for brain function, you know, I bet it doesn't feel like it'd be something that you've ever like, oh, I need some that now. Like, no, get hooked. No, no, I don't think so. No, it doesn't have that profound effect, you know, it's quite honestly, it's like most vitamins, you know, I believe in vitamins and I think it's very important to take care of your body and give it a lot of nutrients and stuff.

Speaker 2:          00:11:16       But most vitamins don't have an immediate effect. You know, he took vitamins. You just know you have an overall sense of what I'm doing the right thing and I'm putting good food in my body. And maybe you might feel like you have like a little bit more energy, but the effects of having a lack of nutrients there, you know, it's slow and long. It's not like you take vitamins and then all of a sudden I feel amazing. No, it's like if you, if you do have a good nutritional base, you will feel better. You know, if you are taking nutrients, your body will be working better and it will work better and this works along those. It's, these are nutrients that help your brain function and how they help you think better. And uh, and I'm in. Let's do it. I want you to try them anyway. If you go to Joe Rogan.net and click on the link for Alpha brain and enter the code name Rogan, you will get 10 percent off and then you can get your freak on. You'd get rubber pussies. You get yourself some brain pills.

Speaker 1:          00:12:13       We're still doing commercials. I'm going to complain about this. This is how we do it. I want to be on the record. I'm going to tweet you guys and long fucking commercial, press the play and let's get the party rolling. Super stoner. Doug Benson is in the house pitches experience Joe Rogan podcast by night. Let's be honest, ladies and gentlemen, the reason why that commercial went so long is we're way too high to be talking publicly. Okay? That was ridiculous. I see what you're saying folks. I see what you're saying. I hear you. I'm on your side now. I don't know man. I'm just talking shit. Five to vaporize. Let's do some more commercials. Yeah. We're not sure if this thing works yet. We're going to give it another few minutes because it stills has read about it though. Apparently it takes like 10 minutes. Yeah, it's like a vaporizer slash pong type device. I could barely do a show these days where somebody doesn't show up with some new contraption. Fangled thing. They want me to try wacky kids these days.

Speaker 2:          00:13:16       You gotTa love him. Hmm. Months. I'm sitting saying unable to connect to the Internet brand. What does that mean? Oh, I just got the son of a bitch. You son of a bitch. So people are complaining about these long form commercials that we're doing and I don't mean to do that to you folks, but that's no other way to do it. I don't know how to. I don't know how to. I'm not going to say the same thing every day. Exactly. That's too fucking boring.

Speaker 1:          00:13:43       Well, you could tell the guest to shut the fuck up. You why? I'm just saying you want it to go quicker, but I, I like it to. I thought that was fine. Like that was. That felt to me like that's part of the show and people like long podcast. So you're just giving them. Just tell them I'm giving you more fucker. Shut up. Yes, but it's because of money. That's why. That's why it freaks them out that you're doing. You're making money like you totally. You motherfucker. Everyone's saying whatever they want about the product. It's not like we're just sitting at sound like we're the sham wow guy or something. Who tries to say funny things and they're just ridiculous. Martini Bikini linguine with of. You're talking about. Does the shamwow guy, does he have a podcast? I don't know. I would like to. He was in jail for beating. It's a girl or something. Everyone has podcasts now. It's kind of scary. Didn't. Some chick is like a hooker bite his tongue or something? Yeah. That shit. That's it. Oh God, man. Hooker Bites your tongue. Dude. You've hit a wall out. You have hit a fucking wall in life

Speaker 2:          00:14:45       when hooker buys your time. Shit. Fuck. That's pretty brutal. A lot of disaster

Speaker 1:          00:14:51       now because human bites are like dangerous. They're dangerous. They're like really toxic. We have nasty mounds were like as dangerous, if not more dangerous than most wild animals. You have a yeast infection in my mouth. Why do you keep having used? When is it going to stop? Just kidding. Have you ever gone down on a girl who has a yeast infection? I don't know. I've never. I don't know. Probably. I have no idea of what a lot of girls right now that are getting angry at this conversation. Tastes like bread. Bread. Yeah. Or beers like fish, fish bread. This is a subject that makes women angry. It makes them really angry. I'm talking about if you're a fucking a girl, what they get like a urinary track infection where it's like, you know, like, oh, that's where the legs just juicing everywhere. Black blood and smells like, oh, vinegar or something.

Speaker 1:          00:15:44       We'll see why women wouldn't enjoy this conversation. Has got to be tough to take care of. You know? Oh, it's so much maintenance. It's the difference between washing a car and being a mechanic. That's what it's like. It's like men just have to keep their fucking car washed, you know, keep your car washed, waxed the hood, boom. You're done. Women have a fucking whole internal thing there. Now we'll check out, get in there. They've got to get under the mechanism for loads for their fucking Kangaroos, a human factory inside their box. They have a human factor in there. I mean Shit, crank shaft. We have balls that make loads. That's what we have and those loads make people. It's really no big deal for us. They have a human making machine inside the vagina. Shit, what the fuck man? What's up, Doug? Where have you been all over the place?

Speaker 1:          00:16:38       You've been on the road like Nice. Remember? Like every time I'm in la, he goes, where were you last weekend? I don't know. I went someplace. You have constant staff and Phoenix last weekend? Yeah, and I, but I, I'm really going where I want to go when I want to go there. Like for the next couple months, I've only playing gigs in California and Florida to avoid winter weather. To have plants. No, no, no, no, no. But I'm home. I, I've only. I've kind of gotten into a pattern in my career, have always trying to be home for a few days, then out for a few days. I never go away for a long time or for stay home for a long time. I just sort of does the go away for a couple days and come back is the best way. When people go out for like three months at a time, all they do is tour that. He doesn't like. You might as well be in a band if you're going to do that, you know? Yeah. I watched that Dang cooked orgasm, you know where he and all those guys and Bobby Kelly. Three poor guy. Yeah. They all went to and toured around. I call those guys and I felt so bad for them having like, because they do stuff like today we're going to go ride horses to see what wackiness happens. And then Robert Kelly falls off the fucking horse and breaks his arm. Yeah. It's just

Speaker 3:          00:17:50       like, oh, you didn't even need to go horse back riding. You could have just been hanging out in a condo like you would if you were out doing your own gig somewhere. Yeah. Yeah. What was, um, what did Robert Kelly break his arm, twisted it or something? He had a. he. Because during a lot of tour guides him, he has some sort of cast or sleeping on his arm I think. Is that what happened? I remember there was like an audio that they were planning on opening. Anthony was talking about his knee, right leg hurt his knee. He broke his leg. I broke my knee. Man, I'd probably need man. Right? Yeah. Yes. I mean maybe I'm just confusing everything, but those guys that had to be really stressful to go on the road. I only did it once with that Charlie Murphy thing, me and Charlie Murphy and John Drawn and uh, it was, it was not the most fun because we weren't doing well like ticket sales.

Speaker 3:          00:18:40       We didn't do well in a lot of places. Like the promotion wasn't the best, so a lot of people had no idea we were even in their towns. It turned out that we only did well in the places where I already did well and Charlie already did well. It wasn't really like a good, it wasn't a really well produced, sort of such a blur too. Like I don't remember anything. Do you remember what city was? What and what club was what it did? And unfortunately, you know, this was before social media. We didn't have like twitter or anything like that. Imagine us having this stream show during that. Oh, had been so fun. Yeah, it had been really fun. It had to be in a different town and we were literally in a different town. Every night we would wake up, stare at the ceiling, going to fuck.

Speaker 3:          00:19:21       Where am I chose? Were asked to blur together for sure. The hotels, airlines and the airports and the shows were awesome, but it just wasn't, it wasn't a financial success. It didn't do well. The only place it only did well and like half the places. Is there a city that you don't like performing in? Like you just think, oh, the crowd's always suck there because people always asked me about that. I, I always have a great time everywhere I go. When you bring your own people now, you know, that's true for us as an opening act for other comics. I always, I never was like, oh, this city's, you know, they don't like me as much as you know, other cities, you know, like sometimes you get a bad crowd, but yeah, I find I don't find one city to be like, oh, that place, the crowds are always really stupid.

Speaker 3:          00:20:06       Or you know, like some places they skew old, like I don't do well at Atlantic city because the crowds are just too old. Right. They're just like, what the hell is he talking about? Right, right, right. Yeah. Yeah. Atlantic city is a tricky place. Yeah. That's a tricky place. I've done that. What does that big theater there? We did that at the Borgata did that a couple times. It's a tricky place. There's a lot of old people. It's a strange thing. It's like, it's sort of like trying to be Vegas, but it's just a, just a hair seedier. Just a hair. Weirder hair, more possibility of murdering the hair. Just a hair more, you know, it's, you know, it's caters to adapt to New Jersey and Philadelphia and you

Speaker 4:          00:20:47       know, everything around there. Like it's, it's more like a localized, like people come from all over the world for Vegas, but if someone's coming from really far away, why are they going to Atlantic city? That'd be, that'd be a weird choice.

Speaker 2:          00:20:57       And Atlantic city's essentially surrounded by dangerous cities. You know, Vegas is essentially in the middle of nowhere, you know, you'd get past bar stone. What the fuck is it? It's just a bunch of weird towns that don't make any sense. You know, that drive to Vegas is the real America though. You know, it's, it's a strange drive. But that drove to Vegas. That's the real America Atlantic city. You have to go through Camden, you know, you pass through the outskirts, south Philly, you know, you. There's like a lot of places around around Atlantic city that are filled with

Speaker 2:          00:21:28       like serious criminals, man. I mean they had a fucking big billboard in Newark when we were there for the UFC big billboard that said, stop killing the teachers. Stop killing the teacher. Is there a big teacher cleaning going on? I don't know, but the fact that there must be something, I mean, otherwise why would you make a goddamn billboard about it saying stop killing the teachers and then, you know, my joke of course was the people who are killing the teachers probably can't read. You know, it's not really helping and by the way they're going to look at that and go, no, no, mighty had killed the teacher. Encourage them a little bit like saying scary, scary place. Newark is a spooky place. I lived in New York for a couple of years. I lived there when I was a little kid and then I lived there again when I was adult for I think about six months.

Speaker 2:          00:22:20       I stayed with my grandfather when I first moved to New York, I couldn't afford my own place and I got signed by this management company and so I had to relocate to New York, so I just balls up, pick up my shed, whatever money I had in the bank and just went. I was gone in like two weeks so I had to stay with my grandfather and he lived on North Ninth Street in Newark, New Jersey, and I'm telling you, man, you might as well have been in another country. It is a crazy little spot. There's a lot going on there, man. There's a lot going on. It's like it's a completely different vibe.

Speaker 4:          00:22:52       I've only gone through there on a train. I don't think I. I don't, I don't think I ever set foot in there. They did this thing called block

Speaker 2:          00:22:59       busting and this is what they used to do. This is how real estate guys made money. It was a really devious practice. They would go into a neighborhood and say, hey, black people are moving in. You better sell now because your property value is going to crash. By the time they move in, you know you're, you're going to be fucked, you're gonna lose your investment. So a lot of people bought into it and a lot of people just took off. Sure enough, boom. It crashed whole neighborhoods. They did it on purpose. They did it to try to make money and my grandfather was like, fuck you. I like black people. Oh, I'm going to stay right here. This is my house. I bought this house and he watched this neighborhood turned from being an all Italian neighborhood to being an all black neighborhood. And then it became like all Spanish, you know, like various different kinds of people from Puerto Rico, from all different nationalities, but a lot of Spanish people now. So it was really almost like a kid watched this whole thing where he was in this old school America, you know, 19 forties, and then boom, all of a sudden he's living in the modern age where everything has just gone crazy around them. I Bet Mitt Romney's done some of that blockbusting oh yeah. That seems like that's in his wheelhouse. Irritating blockbusting blockbusting for Jesus or blockbusting for Joseph Smith.

Speaker 2:          00:24:18       Yeah, he's A. He's A. I'm sure he's a swell guy. We're just joking around. Folks. I'm sure. Mitt Romney's aces. I'm sure he's asis. What he says about a right now he's saying that they should just. Everyone should just go ahead and go, go bankrupt. Like all on all houses. Everyone should just lose their house and let the. Let the market decide what happens to everybody. What the fuck. That's his strategy is just let everybody don't loan any money to anybody. Is that a real statement? That's incredible. That's incredible. Let the foreclosure process happened. Just sit. It's like being raped, like just lay back and let it happen and don't struggle.

Speaker 2:          00:24:58       The ultimate acceptance that as a unit, we're only as strong as our weakest link. You know you have to have. If you're. If you're working towards things as the leader, if you're supposed to be the number one guide that you're, you're at the top calling all the shots. The number one thing you have to take care of is the weakest of the links. That's, that's the people that are fucked up, the weakest of the links that people that are down and out, the people that are homeless, the people that don't know where their next meal's coming from, you've got to take care of them. You got to figure that out. Yeah, and the politics of this country is those people are not paying for the politicians. They're not making the contributions that racist. Racist is a lot of poor white people. Oh yeah. The poverty level or company level, ridiculous.

Speaker 2:          00:25:45       This doesn't matter, right? It doesn't matter. White, white or black, doesn't matter. It's not about that. It's about people that are in despair, you know, and friendly. One to say that they should just suffer. That's ridiculous. You know, some people can't do it on their own man. Some people need a little help. So when people need to be shown how, you know, we need, we need a nation with someone who's an actual guide, someone who can offer real guidance and now they're not doing that man. It's just a money grab. It's a money grab by all these fucking corporate whores and all these people who have paid for these politicians to be in place and paid for these laws to be in place or just reaping the profits while the rest of us freak the fuck out because we can't figure out why the resources are going the way they're going.

Speaker 2:          00:26:28       We were going, why you there? Why? Why do we have 100,000 troops here? Why do we have troops there? Why? Why don't we conserve our fucking resources? Why is that the biggest section of our economy? Why does it have to be this military industrial complex? Why do we have be doing this, this idea to keep us safe, to keep the fuck. Are you talking about man, keep the troops here. Let them guard. Yeah, exactly. If you want to keep us safe all over the country. I have troops all over the outskirts of the fucking country. You know? That's how you keep safe. You don't have preemptive shit, man. I don't know dude. I don't know. The whole thing freaks me out. It freaks me out because I can't believe it's this bad in 2011, I was listening to Robert Anton Wilson Lecture and he was talking, it was in 1993 and he was talking about how war is in the process of being phased out, you know, and he was talking about how in the future it, it's obvious obviously being phased out and I wonder what he would've said now today, thinking about that, like in 1993, that in 1993 I thought war was going to be phased out too.

Speaker 2:          00:27:38       We all thought it was over. You know, we got through that whole crazy desert storm thing under Bush and all of a sudden here we are and it's 2011 and it's crazier than ever. I wonder what he would have said them get made. Is it being phased out because it doesn't seem like it's being phased. It seems like it

Speaker 5:          00:27:55       heating up like we may be pulling out of a couple places, but going into new ones, that's like, what the fuck is going on? If there's something else going on, let me know. All right. If Indiana Jones is found the fucking last temple and the Ark of the covenant is in there and you have to keep the bad guys from getting to it because if not, it'll be hell on earth and hopefully there's some snakes. Yeah, fucking please let me know because otherwise this is crazy. Otherwise, this is crazy

Speaker 2:          00:28:23       and it's so obvious that there's money behind all this shit. This. It's so obvious. We live in the grossest most corrupt country ever. It's so bizarre. Not ever. Of course. I'm just kidding. I mean, I'm sure a lot of Middle Eastern countries and a lot of South American countries, they're

Speaker 5:          00:28:39       pretty corrupt. Corrupt too, but the fact that we're, we're this wonky. You know, and then everybody wants to stand up and say you get, you should get up if you don't like you, you should leave Merck. You know, there's, there's so many Rah Rah Rah fans out there not liking it as what the whole country has been built up. Exactly. That was the idea is that everybody, everybody gets to contribute. It's called the democracy and we're all supposed to participate and help one another and now it's just like it's becoming so every man for himself that the disparity between the richest, the richest one percent and the poorest people is, it's just insane. The difference. It's God damn money grab out there. It's a money grab out there left and right. So are all the occupies right now being shut down like, oh, I haven't been. Each city's kind of treating it differently. Like, um, there's a few cities that are really embracing it. And in La it's not, it's not really a problem. The original one I heard got shut down. Yeah, I heard some crazy shit that they were keeping reporters out and they were forcing reporters out of the area. They said it was for their own safety. That's insulting Bloomberg cleared,

Speaker 4:          00:29:48       but he out at eh, they're all intense and they went through and told everybody they had 10 minutes to get out at 1:00 AM on a Tuesday and uh, and you know, and then they used, they used quite a bit of force to get everybody out of there and now they're letting people back in, but they're saying they can't have tents and sleeping bags like you can go back in and just stand there. And the idea is they figure that that's going to kill the movement a little bit because it's getting so cold and they won't be able to lock. We will be able to last through the winter. But Bloomberg keeps saying it's a safety issue that also that, you know, they have the right to peaceably assemble but they don't have a right to have a tent or a sleeping bag, which is this kind of like, well, but that's so that they can assemble peacefully and not, you know, not just I'll freeze to death in the middle of the fucking park in New York.

Speaker 4:          00:30:35       Like why would they want casualties there? Why would, why would they want people to suffer that much, you know, in order to just express their anger at Wall Street. I mean, I think it's fantastic that it's that, that, that it's happening everywhere, you know, that there's, you know, there's occupied dubuque and stuff like that, but also this new Bloomberg doing this, if he just let it, let it be it, the movement might have died, but it brought this whole new media storm and all these new, all this new footage of cops just beating up these, these people that, that don't look like hippies. They're not all in tie dye. They're just people that are just, you know, concerned and showing up to you to make up

Speaker 5:          00:31:21       mark. They're holding hand by hand. And did you see that video? My brother wouldn't hit my hand. That's just insane. I can't believe that as a, as a fellow person, just being able to do that too. Like that girl little girl. What what he's saying is they were jabbing and with Bhutan. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:31:37       Yeah. And Bloomberg, you know, he makes it all about as horrible. He makes it all about keeping, keeping people of New York safe by kicking everybody out of there and it's like when they were in their tents, who was, who was in danger? Nobody. But as soon as they're.

Speaker 5:          00:31:52       Well maybe he's worried about people freezing to death. Don't think he is. I think ego problem. I don't think he is either, but it is sort of a legal concern. Someone freezes to death on your lawn. Who's responsible for that? Yeah, well it certainly not his lawn. Like it's, it's like a public park that's privately owned. Is it by some corporation? Is that public safety though? Like it's just like our argument is that it's his argument was that people can enjoy the park if the park is full of people that are just point, but it's like, you know, New York City walk two blocks it. Enjoy that other park. Yeah, just one fucking park. But I think what, you know, Eh, yeah,

Speaker 4:          00:32:36       it's a, it's, there's definitely two sides to it, but it just feels like,

Speaker 6:          00:32:40       it feels like, um, you know what Bloomberg did sort of. It sort of energize the movement in a way that it might not have happened. If he did, if he did just let it play out.

Speaker 7:          00:32:50       How would anybody expect them to behave though? They've got to figure out a way to squash this and they have to take drastic measures. There's another go through the middle of the night. Everybody's fucking. There's no MDF sleep and they go in there and just say, you got to go now. Get out with this footage of like cops, you know, lifting guys up and throwing them over the barricade stuff. It's like, it's really. And you know, in the cops for the most part, I like to say they're doing what they're told to do. I don't. I don't like to blame the cops. Yeah. They're given what they're, they're, they're doing what they're told to do, but when they're doing it, all the sudden the people that don't want to listen become the enemy. They become bad guys. Yeah. It's like a bouncer with a drunk person in a class.

Speaker 7:          00:33:28       Like when that drunk person then it gets violent. People aren't bad guys. They should like, like let them still occupy like the trees, like they should be allowed to like live in the trees in the park so that the park be. Yeah, but then what if a hippie falls on you while you're walking? You get some real safety issues. They have to have some safety like chat people that check it out, but then they become an [inaudible] and a couple months and then the idea is the idea is to cause people. The idea is to cause some inconvenience and draw some attention. You know, they, they don't know. You don't. You don't like get together and protest something and imagine that for politely match. If that's where swaths came from the originally people, they were just so fucking stupid. They eventually just became these claude things.

Speaker 7:          00:34:12       Just degenerated to that point. Imagine someone proved that slaw is like, you know, that's like a sin. That's what sends the basics. Ends, right? Yeah. That's my favorite sloths. Yeah. Yeah. What was that movie with Brad Pitt seven with a seven slash 10 of a v? Yeah, that's a good movie. It's a good fucking movie. It's, it's, it's a creepy movie. Went in that one dude that big, the sloths guy was like sitting over hunched over the table and it was the first time where I saw like a body where they had like makeup where it was like blue, like it's been sitting there for awhile, you know that they did a good job. Yeah. Yeah. Dang it looked at as fuck. Yeah. Do you ever do that? What? Get makeup like that on you? Just for fun. Like it looks like your stomach.

Speaker 7:          00:35:01       No, I don't do a lot of things. Just for fun. I know Brian Redmond, bride red band lives just for fun. I wish you got to dragon's layer shirt on. What's that about? You know what? I went to a comic book store the other day because I've been hearing all this shit about how comic book stores are just hurting right now. Like they're, they're suffering the most with is a whole economy. People aren't buying comics anymore. They don't have any free money where, you know they're downloading comp. Kids are downloading comics now, so I decided there's one in Burbank that I've always driven bias. I might check it out, maybe I can find a cool poster for the studio or something. So I went in there and I just. I was in there for like three hours is the best story ever and a bunch of stuff.

Speaker 7:          00:35:42       Bunch of just like random things. It was so cheap. It was like posters were like $7. I was like, well, I never get a chance to brag about this, but I, I the very. I worked at the arcade that had the very first dragon's layer, the test one before it went public and I probably killed the dragon. I was probably maybe the 30th or 40th person in the world to get all the way to the end until the dragon because I would stay at night when I was off duty and I had keys to the place and I would just stay in there and play and play and play until I finally got to the dragon, you know, figured it all out and killed the dragon and uh, you know, and then eventually it went, went public and that is amazing all over the place.

Speaker 7:          00:36:23       Yeah. Nerd boner. I worked at an arcade called star port. It was in a mall, but when you walked in there was all this corrugated tin and stuff that simulate kind of like you're going into like space mountain or something and there's stars on the ceiling. It was, it was kind of a cool themed arcade refresh my memory, because I remember the dragon's lear was like this really cool animated thing where, you know, you would go, you would have, but you would have to move certain ways. There's a series of scenes that would happen on the screen, like an animated movie. It looked like a dog and you had like a, you know, I think you had a regular toggle thing and then a couple of buttons. It's a, yeah, it's a joystick and uh, an action button and usually it started off like you're walking down like a bridge and then like a snake comes up and you have to think what would you want to do?

Speaker 7:          00:37:13       Like either take the sword to the snake or left. But it was more of a guessing game if you had this more like you have to try every combination of things to do, like there's one part where you're like, you're in a, like a cave, roaring down the river in a raft or something and it's like you have, you can go to the right of the left. And so if you toggle to the right, you know, you, you'd go, you'd go the rest of the way without encountering anything. But if you go the other way, something, something goes wrong and you lose a life or something. And um, there's just a bunch of options through the whole thing until finally you get to and kill the dragon. But yeah, it was really, it was weird because it wasn't, you know, it was early enough in video games were, wasn't like you could really make the things do that much because also it was, he was pretty animated, there weren't a lot of options.

Speaker 7:          00:37:59       So like as long as you did the right thing, you move forward or you or, or there'd be a scene of you failing. They have it on the IPAD, I believe now, but that's my dream is to get in a dragon's layer, original dragon's lair arcade game. And my friend actually just got one and I'm so jealous. That's your dream. That was one of my like, you know, like you have dream things like gold shorts. I went the gold short circuit board of it today, man. So yeah, let me give you also another reason to be jealous. Here's the reason to not be jealous is because when that thing breaks down, there's nobody that's gonna fix it. I already have a laser disc player at my house, brand new, just waiting to replace it. Why? You're good enough with that kind of stuff that you can install.

Speaker 7:          00:38:41       The a couple of my friends, that's what they do for a living and the arcade restore restoration. Does that work on laser disk is. Oh yeah, it's a. it's a laser disc. So the game is a laser? Yes. Essentially. Yeah, with just different chat. You just, you when you toggle the correct way or push the button the right way it goes into a different chapter. But honestly nowadays you can mod an arcade games like I could hook up a computer to it and have every single arcade game ever, you know. So you don't even need the laser disk player anymore. Are you using rom? How many options were there for movement? That's what I don't remember. I just remember being completely groundbreaking. Like Whoa, this is like you're, it's like an animal. There was a group, it's amazing. It was just joy stick in one button if I recall.

Speaker 7:          00:39:22       Yeah, you just kinda like are always kind of moving to the left or the right or, or in the case. And it was hard case of like throwing the sword into the Dragon. I think you had to just press the button and and and motion in that direction at the same time. Laser disc game show. The eighties were one of my favorite things ever that he had that mach five or whatever it was called where it was like you're a jet plane and it was like all real film of jets and it was really cool because it was also using a laser disc player. It was like new and the. They had like a space which was also done by Don Bluth who did a dragon's layer and there was one game. They started taking Japanese cartoon movies and making them a video games. A Malibu Grand Prix had a.

Speaker 7:          00:40:04       It was a race track thing in the midwest where they had a whole arcade division. So they took these animated movies and one was called a space six, six six or it was like about a train and it was the coolest video game because you were on top of a train and it was like dragon's layer and it was like a spy movie was so cool, but that didn't ever really catch on. Like it didn't really become, it was big briefly in the eighties, but it didn't become a lot of them, you know, like there's Pac man and then everything that's sort of vaguely remember that. I vaguely remember that in an arcade. What year was this? This was about 85. 80 six I ever saw that. I only saw. I remember space and feeling like it was already like, oh well that's not dragon's layer.

Speaker 7:          00:40:47       That's just an attempt to be like dragon slayer. Home Computer Games must have just crushed video arcades. Right. It did. When the Nintendo finally came out. I mean not like a big video arcade. You remember when we used to go to just video arcades, you'd open the door and it was just, it's always, always with something else or in a weird place like an airport or a scene. What are those? What are those gaven buster type places. They have a room of games, but they also have to have food and drinks and pool tables and you know, a shuffleboard and like no place is just video games except for there's one joint in Portland that's like a whole arcade that's just all old school shit Portland. Right. Of course. It's important that. That's funny. I told you about my friend that does the restoration, spry and Pinzon, Columbus, Ohio.

Speaker 7:          00:41:40       He uh, he, his whole basement, he made a eighties arcade room. So you walked down. It's like you walk down into 1980 and so it's, it's amazing. And it's. So he decorated it like Wayne's world, everything like those, like little pink neon that's always at the top, you know, from the eighties. And as soon as Brian posts saying, made a nickel in show business, he bought a. He and his buddy dave wrath bought a, um, a combination. It was half and half. Ms Dot Pacman, Galaga. Oh, I would just spend hours over his house. Gallagher geologists, the shit. I love it. I'm pretty good at Calico. And then he also got a joust slash robotron and I'm really good at robotron was another one that I, you know, I just worked in an arcade so I just played games all day. Kids would come up to me and they'd be like, can I get some tokens that I'd be like, hang on a second kid, you know, and I'd finished the round, then I'd throw him some tokens and then I'd go back to playing.

Speaker 7:          00:42:35       Like it was the craziest job. Cocktail tables for the studio table. Pacman, joust games. They used to have those like while you're waiting around like in a pizza hut or sit down or sit down table pinball was also kind of cool. There's a place near me that the movie theater has an arcade that was a little entry room. We can go and play video games while you're waiting for your movie. I just liked the look of it. I liked the style of arcade games. Like I don't even play it much. Like I have a pac man at the studio and I barely ever play. I just liked the lights of it. I like just the look it, it's so Goddamn Lynard skynard poster. That's right. It relaxes you and you're masturbating or get turned on by these video game commercials. I get turned on by these video game commercials, but not to the point where I'll go out and get it out.

Speaker 7:          00:43:27       Really. I won't, I won't allow myself. I just know that I will, you know, any new video game, I sort of kicked it, you know, I just stopped doing it altogether. Uh, you know, after uh, I'd say after Mario Kart. Yeah. I used to play that day and night and then after a while you're just like, what is getting great at this gonna do for me. It's fun, but it's the truth. You're getting tricked, you're getting tricked into doing something absolutely stupid with your time. And it hijacks your, your whole idea, your reward system, you know, you're succeeding, you're focused, you're in on it, but really you're not even in the real world. You're in this getting all these signals from this fake world. Yeah. But it's like watching a movie to me nowadays, you know, it's, it's like watching a movie to me, I want to escape reality, but I want to have more control of the movie united. So that's kind of why I do. I don't watch as many movies anymore. My time when you have interactive video games, there's a lot of thinking involved, especially if you're playing like if you're playing counter strike or something like that or playing quake or, and any John Madden, you

Speaker 1:          00:44:32       got to know about all the players and stuff. Oh, there's a lot of thinking going on. Like your synapses are firing, you know whether or not you choose to think

Speaker 2:          00:44:39       they're firing on something useful or not. That's, you know, that's really sort of an arbitrary decision. Like you can't say that this person isn't actually training their mind through intensive video games

Speaker 1:          00:44:49       because you're doing intense video games. You're multitasking, you're fucking, your synapses are firing, you're moving your fingers. You have to first person shooters. You have to be in direct coordination with your left hand, which movies your keys and your right hand, which controls the mouse. And you know, there's a lot of shit going on. You can't tell me that. That's not exercise for the mind. I played a lot of golden eye too, now that I think, you know, they rereleased what's gold? And it was the first James Bond, like the pretty cool. Was it good? I'll run around different weapons type thing, but if they'd have, you know, you could play for people at a time. So me and two other people just sit there for hours chasing each other around trying to shoot each other.

Speaker 2:          00:45:30       So stupid. Yeah, man. The whole staff on Newsradio, the entire writing staff was addicted to quake and they had a land set up, a local area network setup in the office where they had like six, seven computers all linked up together and they would have these mad quake tournament's and was courageous. It was really fucking fun. It was unfortunately though, highly, hugely addictive. And yeah, I would, I would, uh, I would get really stuck playing know where I was like, you know, 7:00, 8:00 in the morning, early, I got to go home. Like I make myself drive home because we were all playing

Speaker 1:          00:46:07       when I worked at gateway, all the tech guys with all the gateway stores in Columbus. Uh, we used to have land parties. Every Friday we'd have just get alcohol and uh, we all have like shuttle or like small little portable computers are cantaloupes. And then we would just sit there and play battlefield 19 or whatever for like hours till like five in the morning. No Glare. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:46:31       No, it's a fun. We used to do that in like the quake claim that I was in. We would get together in Houston, Texas. They would, most of those guys lived in Houston. So we would go to Houston, have these, a local area network parties set up in this. All the computers set up in this room.

Speaker 1:          00:46:45       Heavy acid. I've seen places. That was the thing, the studio make it like a huge. Also, you could sit down and just have like a land party every time you hang out there. Dude, if we do and do a podcast or email, I have a real problem. You can only do it once a month to podcast play. If you want to put some quick on there once a week car open up the door. I opened up Pandora's box. Yeah, that'd be cool. Land Party podcast. I got to play guys era. You did. Why were. Why was a good pool player? That's why you played with him. Yeah. He's a buddy. Yeah. Yeah. I didn't know. I didn't know you knew him or what, but like it just went to his house. Are we met?

Speaker 3:          00:47:30       We met at a pool hall. Where's the pool hall? Because that's another thing that seems to be dying. It's not hard to find pool halls. This was the house of billiards in Sherman Oaks. Yeah. It's hard. Hard to find good places. Vegas has the most good places. Vegas still has 24 hour pool halls, which is an anomaly outside of Vegas. It used to be in New York you could get 24 hour pool halls a lot. There was Chelsea, Chelsea billiards, and there was a bunch of other smaller places that were 24 hours. I don't know how many of them are left, but Chelsea is gone and a lot of other big ones are gone. That's crazy. At 24 hour place to play a sport. There's not many of those. There's not like anything else. The name pool really is all about gambling. It's really pocket billiards. It's called pool because everybody's pooling their money together and bending.

Speaker 3:          00:48:10       The Fun in pool is all about money. It's all about gambling and so you would go to these places and the reason why they were open 24 hours a day because no one ever wanted to leave. They would just play. You get down and try to get back up. Guys would sleep under the tables. It was so common that guys would stay there for two, three days. Yeah. I would go and do gigs. I'd come back and the same guys will be there from the night before and the same clothes. Almost like a job for a lot of guys. Yeah, and they would. They would be gambling like crazy, but it was always fun. It was always exciting. You know, the, the, the world of gambling and pool and, and that like, you know, if you're, if you're in an auction room, that's fucking fun, man.

Speaker 3:          00:48:51       It's, it's very addictive, you know, but it's again, it's just like the video game thing. It's like, what are you doing by getting really good at putting balls in holes? What are you doing? Gambling illegally and getting, getting in scrapes with guys because you don't for the most dudes, for the most part, if everybody knew everybody. There was very few problems, but there was always stories. If you know, this guy wanted his money back and he came at this guy with a fucking golf club and you know, there was always those stories. I saw a few scuffles over the years of hanging out and pool halls. But for the most part when people paid, you know, they, they, if they wanted to keep gambling, they had to pay when they lost because everybody had. There was a gambler's ethic. If you, if you cause trouble when you lost and you're only happy when you won, nobody would gamble with you.

Speaker 3:          00:49:36       People didn't want to. So they were just naturally became guys who had good reputations and guys who didn't and if he didn't know the guy don't play him. So it sort of Tom Cruise and Paul Newman's showed up. That was the big. That's when people realize how fun it was. But it's one of those things. It's getting, it's, it's sort of getting lost in our culture. When we were playing last night, there was a girl a at a table next to us that was pretty good. She, she could play pretty good and she was with her boyfriend who couldn't fucking play at all and she was humiliating him and he was trying getting super upset, but it's like she didn't even try to help him. His technique was fucking horrible. His elbows up in the air. He was putting all kinds of extra spin on the ball. I couldn't make a ball to save his life. And the girl was like, just laughing at him and jumping up and down. Every time she won. And you could see him getting fucking pissed.

Speaker 2:          00:50:28       Getting actually pissed off that she was like bragging because she was winning this game. Like you see them, like almost want to hit her. I'm like, wow, there's some deep seated shit in this game. Augie. All competition between dudes and their girlfriend. Any kind. It brings out some really weird shit, man. You got to win against a woman no matter how nice to women you are and how much you respect them. Still this weird thing kicks in. That's just hardwired. Yeah. I was dating. This is how I got into pool. I was dating this chick and she was a little older than. And she used to like to tell them what to do and I didn't really like that, but I like to fuck her. So I stuck around for a little while. But uh, we played. That was one of the things she tells you to do.

Speaker 2:          00:51:15       Yeah, we played pool once and uh, she beat me playing pool. She was not, I wasn't good. So I wouldn't say she was pretty good, but she beat me. And so I said, Oh shit, I found something. She's good at, you know, like she's, she's, she's better at meeting this. Well, this is terrible. I have to fix this. I have to fix this at once, so I went to the pool hall and learn how to play pool and we started practicing. Teacher went and I, I got a book on it. I, I, I got my own cue. I figured out how to play pool and then we played again and I killed her. Yeah, we get it. I totally practice, totally learn how to pull play pool and then winter. I mean I wasn't good by any stretch of the imagination, but at least I knew how to play pool like I was.

Speaker 2:          00:51:59       I was definitely way better than it was the first time we played and then I won. So I like I, I had a problem that I couldn't let her have beaten me in something and this is how I got addicted to playing pool. I'm imagining you being like the zookeeper character as you're telling that story. I was totally like that guy. Well that was the dark days. That was the actual fighting days. The dark days. I was, I was way crazier. Yeah. I can't think of an example of something I taught myself to be better at, to, to beat my girlfriend, but I'm sure it happened. I could not let her. She was. She was older than me and she was smart. There was no way. She was a very educated person to, you know, she was a musician. She was in a lot, a lot, a lot of shit going on.

Speaker 2:          00:52:39       She ever wrote a song about you when you guys were doing. That'd be cool if there was a song out there. I mean, she's a nice person, very nice person, but couldn't sort of. No, no, no. It's very hard to stay in touch with people. You know, when you used to date them and all down they date other people. They don't want some dude fucking calling and texting and emailing. It's not great. It's not right. You know which from the best and the don't confuse everybody. You can confuse the shit out of people. You know, don't you think you know, but you know, all of a sudden you know you're in a fight with your husband and you know you're, you're having an email talks with your ex boyfriend. Then all of a sudden you start thinking, you know, maybe this guy and I could give it one more shot. Maybe that's why it, it can conflict,

Speaker 3:          00:53:26       you know? I think if it's an

Speaker 4:          00:53:27       open forum only then that's cool. Like a facebook wall posts and stuff like that. Like, hey, how have you been? And we should hang out sometime or something like that. Or maybe you could do some gamesmanship or somebody wants something and then the trouble is the other people in your life start questioning what's going on and it sucks.

Speaker 3:          00:53:46       Yeah, it sucks. It's annoying. Really. We should be able to just fuck everybody. That's really ideal, but no one can handle that. Red Bands. The only person that could handle that. No. Could you imagine if the ego actually gets completely cured, that you can't have art, then that'd be senior. You're not going to have artists like the best jokes were to get paid. Art is like the struggle, the best painter artist, like the struggle between the ego and like the, the desire to produce something fantastic to please others. You know, and if you don't control the ego, you, you, you can't really produce aren't. But the fight with the ego is what fuels the art sometimes. So if we had no ego, we'd have no art, no art, but people would just fuck like randomly. Everybody would just be able to fuck everybody. You wouldn't worry about it.

Speaker 4:          00:54:36       It takes nerve to be an artist because you're basically saying, you know that I can do this thing so well that people are going to want it. It's very arrogant. Yeah, super arrogant. But it's also, you know, it starts out like you're, you know, you're just like, I get people asking me all the time, how do you become a standup comic? And I'm just like, I do it. That's how you become one. You just do it. And then they're always like, yeah, but do you have any advice? And I really like just lots of little tiny pieces of advice you can give if you want to sit with a person and talked to them for two weeks. But big advice is just do it.

Speaker 3:          00:55:15       Never underestimate the power of actually fucking doing something. And also I'll also not the, the, the fact that they're questioning it at all, the fact that they're looking to someone else for help to get started makes you think that they. How are they ever going to make it? Because they don't want it badly enough. They're not going to just do it. You know? I never asked anybody, oh yeah, this is what you have to do to go on stage. What do you have to do against days? That was my, my initial question, but once I got in and started doing open mics, I just, you know, you, you, you figure it out by doing it and trial and error. No one's good. No one's good. The no one that you know who thinks they're funny. You can go on stage and kill in front of a room full of strangers.

Speaker 3:          00:55:52       You might laugh if you think they're your buddy and they're up there. Yuck, Yuck it up, but guess what? It's a, it's a weird fucking way to communicate with people and it really is not all that it seems. It's a very tricky sort of a craft that you have to learn and develop. But you can do it. Anybody can do it, but nobody's good in the beginning. Nobody is good in the beginning. Yeah. Or you get, you know, you get your labs here and there and that's encouraged. You get a little chuckle here and there. You know, you feel like you're onto something but you suck. Dude, we all sucked. Everybody does not have your first

Speaker 2:          00:56:24       time. Is that usually the best to within the next 10 times, but some people get an extra charisma bump to that. Yeah. You know what I mean? Like I bet you the first set of like Bill Hicks, Eddie Murphy. Yes. Yeah. Spade started really early. Rock started really early, like those guys were probably were, you know, very decent their first time out, you know, just because you know that it's that charismatic personality. Well, I was talking about he has, who is one of my favorite comedians of all time. Joey Joey is in my opinion, he's at a just sheer laugh out loud, fall down moments. He's provided me with the most, if any human being ever. And Joey was not that good when I met him. He was not that good on stage. He just couldn't do it. It was a real weird thing. I don't know what it was.

Speaker 2:          00:57:08       He's just a hilarious dude. I mean he's hilarious talking about anything but he maybe he couldn't focus it into setup punchline kind of maybe. I don't know what it was or bins turned a fucking corner man and I don't remember when it was, but our, it was, it was actually, I don't, I don't know, maybe maybe three, four years in. I don't know what it was, three, four years in o and m, he turned this fucking corner and just started destroying. Wavy just became more himself. Yeah. Oh, he definitely did. He, he just learned to be relaxed on stage. He just eat, you know, I asked him what happened and he was like, I just stopped giving a fuck. Yeah, yeah. He said, I stopped giving a fuck. Yeah. Not trying too many things, too many people telling them what to do. And he was like, fuck you, I'm going to do it my way.

Speaker 2:          00:57:54       And when he did that, boom, he was awesome. But when he was trying to make everybody happy, he just couldn't. He couldn't, he couldn't really be himself, you know, himself as the, I don't give a fuck guy that tells the funny stories in the back of the comedy store and that's the guy that we all knew and loved. But then on stage he figured out how to do it and that was, you know, that's, that's the most dramatic at, of my life of seeing someone go from not being good to being really good. Joe Is the most dramatic.

Speaker 4:          00:58:21       Oh, I got it. I got my most dramatic one. Who was Doug Stanhope? Doug Stanhope wasn't good in the beginning. Well, you know, he was, I don't know how raw he was when I saw him. He was, what year was this? Oh man, a long time ago. It was like a, it was back when, you know, Steve Sherpa was still physically there at the Riviera comedy club and it was maybe even still an Improv at that point. And I was one of two. I always wanted to feature acts with this other guy named Tom Martin knew now he writes on simpsons and stuff and the headliner was hugh fink and Doug Stanhope was the host, the Mc for like one of those crazy weeks where you do two shows a night for seven nights and uh, and crowds were starting to get smaller than, you know, like the kind of the vegas comedy boom was starting to fade a little bit and Sherpa would just yell at him every night, you know, he was like that weeks punching bag and what was just yelling at him. But he was, it was just Doug Stanhope. Well, just, you know, being laid, bringing, bringing a girl into the showroom without asking ahead of time and like, like triple just, you know, it happened to me a few times. He just sort of picks one person to sort of pick on to kind of establish to the group that you can't get away with anything.

Speaker 4:          00:59:39       But Doug, like a super, super good kid, you know, nice guy. I was a few years older than him and thought I really had it under control and the three of us, we just all that we're working with them, we just all sort of thought, oh, you know, we'll see what happens with him because it's, his act was just like, he was just like anybody's, like, just somebody trying to do is stand back and not. I think he, Stan hope really turned a corner when he just started talking about his own experiences instead of trying to say, do you ever notice that he's not an observational comic? I mean, there's observations within what he's talking about because these stories are so interesting and he saw such a funny guy.

Speaker 3:          01:00:14       Well, when you're young it's like, what do you have to really talk about? Said that.

Speaker 4:          01:00:19       Like, I remember he had this one bit where he would talk about. He would talk about, uh, he would describe how nasty a egg roll is and how much he doesn't like egg rolls and it's like as an audience member, you know, maybe 50, 70 percent of the audience loves eggrolls. So then it was just kind of like, you just kind of sit there going, well, this, you know, he's got to figure out, uh, you know, he's either got to have more of a personal take on why they're bad to convince us or he's got to drop that because, you know, egg rolls are awesome, they're delicious. You. It's just like, he was like, they're filled with mulch. I remember that was one of his punch punch slides was just the word mulch. You know, how like the weirdest thing stick out when you work with somebody for like a week. Like there's some sentence or thing that they talked about that you remember. And I always remember that, but I've always, you know, I've known him ever since then. He never, you know, he just kept plowing away and became, you know, such a powerful, funny comic like himself found himself then became himself. Yeah, totally. And you know, again, kind of had like sort of a hook of being like the guy that's going to talk about, you know, some pretty horrifying things

Speaker 3:          01:01:29       with Doug Stanhope business. The real deal, he's legit does and hope really is that guy. He really does live in a crazy house, is painted weird colors, growing crazy house. She really is on all sorts of fucking crazy pills. Joe, remember, awesome American flag out there. Yeah, dude ass. Yeah, I was there when he was still have homeless people live on his fucking front lawn like Arizona, Utah. He's in business. Well, should I even say goes everywhere he does. He's lives in Arizona,

Speaker 4:          01:01:55       but he tours and puts on his own, like he kinda, you know. Yeah, it does. It does. He tours like a Rockstar, like he goes to town to town.

Speaker 3:          01:02:02       Doug had a fucking house that was painted like an American flag in Venice and we would go party at his house. When we were doing the man show, he rented this House that was literally a fucking American flags and it was right on the street and he had the little fenced in area in the front. He would let homeless people stay there, so he had this homeless couple that was staying there and the fucking woman stabbed the man and they got a video of her looking at her hands because she had blood on her hands from the guy she stabbed and she was. She had like an accent and she was like, I'm a company. Come from my whole, I'm a, I'm a whore. She kept saying something, something. I'm a client, I'm a whore, and she was looking at. It was dark dude and this is all on Doug Stanhope been lost. He was so crazy. I was like, dude, you're hanging out with people who are like probably like severely imbalanced. It's not just a matter of them being homeless like the. A lot of the homeless people that you find on the streets are really people that were kicked out of mental institutions, you know, or got out of mental institutions that didn't have anybody to take care of them and there's a lot of crazy people

Speaker 4:          01:03:03       or just lost their mind randomly and didn't, didn't fit in slowly

Speaker 3:          01:03:06       but surely eroded until that was their reality. Their reality was there. The rats of society. You know,

Speaker 4:          01:03:13       that's funny that I brought, when I brought dug up, I totally, I totally skipped that whole, that you guys did a show together thing like I talking, I knew you knew who he was because he's so funny. But I was talking about it like, you know, yeah. You know, we both know who Doug Stanhope, but you actually really know the guy. Like I just run into them here and there over the years and we've always been friendly and I just recently just told them when you're in La, you know, let me know because I want him on my podcast. He's been on this right?

Speaker 3:          01:03:43       Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. He's awesome. He's a funny. He's really doing it too.

Speaker 4:          01:03:49       And his episode of Louis Ck show was great.

Speaker 6:          01:03:54       Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:03:55       That was weird seeing him like that, wasn't it? Yeah. But also it's interesting, amalgam of, you know, what he's really like. And then some, you know, some things that,

Speaker 6:          01:04:03       you know, Louis just wrote for him to play that, you know, we're, I guess Louis just sort of, you know, rounding out the character in a dramatic way because I don't know if I don't, I doubt Doug's ever gone to Louis and said I'm going to kill myself. Right. It's been nice. It's been nice knowing you

Speaker 3:          01:04:22       those not going to do that, unless that was wrong. And then he would do that. Who is, he lived. Totally. Hunter s Thompson himself, a hunter. S Thompson was done, man. He had hip replacement. Surgery was in constant pain and he couldn't walk, couldn't swim. He was fucked up man. And he didn't like living life like that and he was 60 something years old and he was like, that's it. Boom. Checkout time, you know? And he decided to do it that way. Doug would do that, you think? Yeah, yeah, yeah. He would do that. That's what I take bats. Yeah. Make sure he's okay. You know what? What's the alternative? Let it slowly run out of batteries. Die In the corner. I don't know, man. Exactly the alternative vaporizer coming. Um, it's probably heated up by now. Well, it still says read on it. I think that's a nice special effect to me.

Speaker 3:          01:05:15       I mean, how long do you think we've been talking for? Twenty minutes. An hour and five minutes. No Way. That's ridiculous. This podcast is to easy, Doug. You're not. Casting is so much fun. It's so much fun. It's the most fun thing we've ever done, you know, as far as like the most honest connection with people, you know, and you just sit there and talk and for people like that, they're like working right now. You know, I, I, I think it's the coolest thing ever. I'm so happy that we can do something like this. You know, entertainers want to entertain, you know, I mean comics want to be funny, people want to talk. It's, we love doing it, you know? So the fact that it's such an honest relationship, we love doing it. We put it out there, it's free, boom. People enjoy it. It's such a great relationship. You know what I'm saying? You creating friends all over the place, that's what you're doing, you know, and that's the people that come out to see you at the, at the comedy clubs. They're friends now because I just, just this last weekend,

Speaker 4:          01:06:13       funny because I was in Arizona in flagstaff and then um, Phoenix and uh, I didn't know I was going to be doing the show this week, you know, I thought, oh, I'll be on again at some point. You know, I, I figured I'd be back here on the show, but I didn't know you called me like yesterday or the day before and we set this up. So last weekend there's about, there's about, over the course of a couple of shows, there's probably about a good 10, 15 people who said to me, go on Joe show again or I want to hear you on Joe show again. And I was just like, yeah, don't worry about it. It'll happen.

Speaker 3:          01:06:46       And they're probably right now being like, what the fuck he was going to be on the couple of days later. We don't really schedule this thing and advanced folks. We'd keep this bitches organic as possible. But also you're dealing with

Speaker 4:          01:06:58       the schedules have, you know, I mostly have your comedian friends, you know, they're all in and out of town and have shit to do.

Speaker 3:          01:07:05       Well, this is what the coolest thing about it is that, you know, most of us are around. If we're around, we're around like the days we do the podcast, like Tuesday, Thursday, and now it really has an impact on, on guys gigs too. Especially Duncan. Duncan's getting like some fucking sweet gigs. He's getting an pack in places. Man Dunkin sold out his first show ever in Seattle and he was tripping out. It's like

Speaker 4:          01:07:27       the fuck man.

Speaker 3:          01:07:31       That's awesome. He brought back little Hobo puppet thing that he does the Hobo love. I love the new dol itself, you mean? Yeah, it's awesome. It's little Hobo is one of my all time favorite bits and people either get it or they don't get it, but either way it's fun for me. I love it. Oh yeah. When they don't get angry in comedy. It's so funny. Well, if they get uncomfortable, sometimes it's even more fun. You know, just dumped shit. Fucking send some, you know, he says some dark shit in that bit. I don't want to kill any of his punchlines. Yeah, don't talk about that. There's a lot of people that hear that and get what? He got. A bunch of people walk out on him and Atlanta. Georgia. Are you serious? Yeah. Christian couple got up and left. He talking, talking about Jesus onstage.

Speaker 3:          01:08:20       Hey Man. People have their beliefs. They don't want you to fucking with their beliefs. They didn't come to a comedy show to get change. God dammit. They came to a comedy show to laugh. Did you ever can't make everybody laugh? You're no good. Mr Comedian she ever had family reunions growing up like, like, no. You met at a park with other parts of families that you didn't know you were connected to at all and like these like, wait, that's your second cousin to the left and you're like, what the fuck? I'm related to that person now that you recall? Yeah, New Jersey. I guess when I was real young we did have a few of those. I was really young when I was before I was sick so I barely remember it like you said it and it makes me like have little flashes that might not even be real know they were put in there, but I talk about this on stage which is true.

Speaker 3:          01:09:03       I remember one vivid moment when I was young because everybody was mad at me because I hit my cousin with a bag of cookies and everybody was mad because the cookies went flying and I remember the cookie of looking at the cookies and the dirt and shit. I fucked up but I was like four and people were angry at me and I remember that. It's amazing that they. That there could be even a semi vivid memory. I mean, when you say like I have a vivid memory of it, what does really mean? How much are you extrapolating? How much are you, how much are you exaggerating? How vivid is it real? It was big enough in the first place to some form of it his and sometimes like because that's the thing that's crazy to me. It's like whenever somebody remembers a ton of stuff from when they were little, I'm always kind of baffled by that.

Speaker 3:          01:09:49       I think it's almost like they're just sort of taking what they kind of remember and then just going ahead and filling out the story. Exactly. I think that is a lot of what happens. I don't think our memories and I fucking good and I think they don't understand really where memory is stored. You know, the, the issue with memory and the brain is that they believed that every seven years virtually every cell in the body has regenerated and reborn in new. So there's a new version, like in seven years. Every cell is different than the seven years before except the neurons. And so they don't know if that memory is stored somehow in the neurons or if it's just sort of handed down like files. Like every seven years you got a new administration comes in and goes, look, this is the past, this is the uncle that fuck them.

Speaker 3:          01:10:35       This is the thing that happened in second grade. This is the car accident. All this is, you've got to remember this. So you got it, got it. And then they take it and then seven years later out, have pockets of things you don't remember or the things you remembered at one point and don't remember anymore. I, I hold at episodes of my life. I don't remember. I watched like an old fear factory run. I had no recollection of any of it. And it was only 10 years ago and I'm watching. I don't remember this. I don't remember this happening. I don't remember this. This is weird. I have the two earliest memories I have when is breaking a pickle jar at a grocery store? Like one of the huge and it just remember

Speaker 7:          01:11:13       it being scary. I remember like doing it and stuff like that. And falling in, I guess, I think it was like two or three when it happened and the other one is getting attacked by a bunch of chickens at this farm. And I got picked. I think I've said that before where I got back and I have a scar in between my nose because I was near a chicken nest. Eat Chicken every day, but fried chicken every day with one hand on my Dick. Right. But both of those memories I remember, like I remember that happening. I remember the pickle jar. I remember being attacked by chickens, but I don't remember it in first person. I remember kind of being above and looking down at myself while my. Well that's the files you've got handed down the third person view with those both stories that uh, the family liked to tell. Like remember we know that huge pickle jar. Not really. Like every time I bring it up to my mom, she has no idea. She has no idea. I have to like remember. And then she goes, that wasn't an important file for her when she was. She didn't need to remember that. Yeah. Yeah. That's brutal when your parents don't remember important shit that happened to you and that's a big thing like breaking a pickle jar. Come on by. Poor little brian could have been dead to the fell on the sharpest point of that.

Speaker 3:          01:12:20       It could be the over. Yeah. He could have died. Right? If it cut me night, I almost fell off a cliff. I almost fell off a cliff in San Francisco. I was like, yeah, am I grabbed up? My father grabbed me at the very last second. He's your angel. Yup. Yeah, some cliffs, San Francisco. Some little areas we walk like down near the beach that are really kind of sketchy. You know, there's some areas we could fall down and really fuck yourself up, man. You could die. Yeah. The whole. That whole Pacific coast highway is so immensely fucking beautiful but so scary given drive that, that, that the pch. Francisco was that wild? Doesn't that make your balls just tingle like their crackling like they have? What does that say? Stuff? The snap pop rocks. Remember pop rocks that would do to your mouth.

Speaker 3:          01:13:12       That's what makes your balls feel like when you're going around the whole Pacific coast highway, looking at that fucking cliff, that fucking drop that's right there, right there, and it's forever and the ground moves around this bitch all the time. It's like you're essentially playing a game of musical chairs. You're just hoping you can get from this point to that point where the really thin fucking outcropping that you're a little metal boxes driving around with nothing to stop you from just driving right the fuck off the thing into the ground and the rocks in the ocean. You never drive it in a storm. Oh my God. You did iop. Yeah. I've had situations where like, you know, where it's like a, the waves are crashing up on it. I was, I was stone cold sober. I was, it was a sunny day. Um, I was wide awake and I was still shitting my pants.

Speaker 3:          01:14:02       I was like, this is a crazy drive man. It's weird to look at. It's just a mind fuck. It's a mind fuck that just a little, you know, or someone's coming at you, you're trusting this other asshole that you don't even know to not be texting right now to not be fingering himself. You know your tampons with Paulina asleep. All of those at one of those at once. Everything tsunami of bad luck coming your way and you're on the left hand lane. You get bumped off into the fucking great blue yonder of the ocean floor. Fuck man. That's a crazy way to drive. You know, I would like to. I like to have less worry about death in my drawer.

Speaker 7:          01:14:46       Driving is always scary to me. I mean just today I was driving, there was fucking like a sandbag truck overturned or something like that and they're just sandbags everywhere in the highway out of nowhere. Like you're just driving all these sand bags.

Speaker 3:          01:14:57       Dude, I hit a fucking one of those railroad ties, those iron things. What are those? The tracks. Not at tire track. Section of track. Someone had dropped on the fucking highway. I was driving and I saw it last minute. I saw this thing and I was like, oh fuck. Like I remember gripping with both hands. There's no way I could turn if I tried to turn out what I would have flipped the car, you know, it was just too close and I hit it and I got the car launched into the air, the carwash and blew the fucking tires right off the rims. Like the bolt, I think at least one of them, like literally was shredded and I drove on rims to the next exit and got out and just called the tow truck and had it dealt with. But it was a spooky moment.

Speaker 3:          01:15:45       Man. I hit that fucking thing. I sought last minute. I'm like, Oh fuck, that's metal. You know, it's like that thing fucking. Oh my God. It's not lucky. It didn't. You know, sometimes when you drive over something too, like you can, you can rip out the bottom of your car, you know, it could come up and it can go into the bottom of your car and can drop a tranny real easy. Fuck yeah. I just wanted to say that in adult life, a dropped his tranny in highschool guys are blow their fucking their transmission apart, doing donuts. There was a common thing guys would fuck up their trainees. We'd hear him driving the next day here, the transmission best find clank, clank, clank clank because guys were doing smoke shows.

Speaker 7:          01:16:31       It's San Diego. When I was in high school there was this, there was this street where it was kind of like a San Francisco style street where it went down, it went pretty steep and then straight for just a bit and then steep again and you could fuck in. You could get air and you know, if you want it to going down. And so we would intentionally drive fast enough to get the car up into the air. And it was like, it's the dumbest thing you could do. Most people don't know, but we all got away with it because, you know, everyone just did it a few times. The dukes of Hazzard, I believe you ever fuck your car. Um, did you ever break it? W W one time on another hill driving with some friends as a joke, I, uh, or as a joke, I just, for

Speaker 3:          01:17:10       whatever reason I was gonna I was trying to throw the car in neutral and I throw it into reverse while going know quickly downhill. Oh my fucking noise at that made with. Oh my God. Yeah. Yeah. I immediately had to just pull the car over and, you know, get it, get it towed and get it fixed and just exploded your transmission. I, yeah, just really they shouldn't be able to go there. It shouldn't be able to go into reverse that. You shouldn't be able to do that. But it was like an old. It was like an AMC Hornet. Oh. And uh, it was, it was pretty dumb why you're going in for direction. Isn't there a way to engineer some sort of a way that doesn't just think you can't anymore? I don't think you are. Yeah. You have to kind of, you move it to the side, you know, it's almost like a stick shift where you have to kind of a medicine bottle or cut into each each level or whatever.

Speaker 3:          01:17:56       But you know, I was a kid, teenager, you a silly, goofy, odd, did so much silly shit when I was a kid. It's amazing. The kids should be allowed to drive cars. Oh, it's so now when I'm driving around and if I get cut off by somebody that looks like they're 15, 16. I was just like such assholes. Like also when I was that age I, I was an asshole driver, but I didn't have all I had was maybe an occasional fast food from the driving. I didn't have texting, you know, I didn't have headphones on or all, all the, all the distractions of today and now I can't believe that there's any, there's anywhere in a car that has a, a, a, you know, a TV. There's not like, there's not like a limo that's being driven by a professional. You know what I mean?

Speaker 3:          01:18:40       Like, just even if you have your kids in the backseat watching some shit on TV, wouldn't that be an extra distraction that. No, it's the opposite dangerous or you just like how focused it makes the kids to kids zone out for kids are done. But why do you. But you definitely don't need a TV up, up above the rear view mirror. No, that's stupid. That's ridiculous. You can't see that's, that's how it is. And I rented a car, um, I rented a who was an escalator navigator, one of those and that's what the TV was. The TV would come down in the center and they would block the view. You, you couldn't see, you look over your rear view or like a, you know, to watch it when you're not in motion, you're supposed to watch an emotion because the kids, you know, that's when, that's one of the tunes amount, but the better ones are on the headsets and now they have them on the headsets where you can have a.

Speaker 3:          01:19:26       each one is watching a different thing so they can watch their headphones. When you have limited time, you got a three and a half year old. That's the perfect shit. They just zonked out. No more questions. It's just a watch. Dora the explorer and they have a good old fucking time so they don't even mind driving. You know, they don't mind driving because driving for them it's like going to the movies they have like cool little dvds they watch and they have a good time and the dvds you can get like little educational ones. So it's actually good for them. I love them. Watch like, you know there's like your kid can read and shit. Kids are going to be way smarter today than we were. We didn't get access to anything until we were fucking. It's gonna be cool in the future. I bet you the babies

Speaker 7:          01:20:08       are going to be so smart at such a young age that they're going to be able to drive cars for you. So they're going to be like, as a kid, being able to see the babies, then we're going to be able to drive for you firing of the mine where you didn't think about that at all. Babies out of the womb, we're just going to drive. You never know they could drive everyone around. Driving is gonna be so easy because it's all going to have magnets around your whole car that they just have to push one button for like on or sign. You're such a silly man. Such a silly mad, you know? Why do, why do you want more babies? I need more drivers. I need more people driving me around that I don't ever see and knowing no one wouldn't want to have sex with. It would just be a matter of, yeah,

Speaker 3:          01:20:49       life experience, but you have full intelligence right away. He just needed life experience. So we make you work as a driver for the first years. People are going to be a DM or smarter. They're going to be in some areas they're going to be dumber because some things are going to become obsolete. Like you're not going to ever need to know a phone number. Math maybe, but hopefully people will adaptation, right? I mean that's what's going on. We're adapting to this new environment. We're adapting to these new needs. You know, it's unquestionably something's happening and we're getting to a symbiotic relationship with technology, but can you imagine how much space in your brain is available that would 15, 20 years ago be full of phone numbers that you don't need to remember anymore, but don't you remember a lot of different things now? Don't you think that you have a lot of information that you get through the Internet that probably would never get before?

Speaker 3:          01:21:42       You know, a lot of people, it was difficult for them to be stimulated in the days before the Internet, but today there's not a time in the world where I'm in an airport that has wifi. We're on board yet, but you know, I love. I love the airport wife. You know what I'm saying? Will you just sit there and you can either goof around or get stuff done, but either way you're killing the time. You're. Yeah, you're, you're, you're, you know, you're enjoying yourself. You're actually having a good time. You're getting entertained, but you are also using a different than some people

Speaker 7:          01:22:10       use the internet. A lot of people just go in there and play cards and talk about video games. I have

Speaker 3:          01:22:16       a say if you have a, an hour to kill and you were at the airport, you know, you log on your favorite video game for them and you find out what the hell's going on. It's entertaining and then listen to podcasts. It's um, it's very, it's a very interesting, like a progression to try to like look ahead too. It's like what the fuck is this going to go next? Like what does the next symbiotic relationship between human beings and technology? Because the cell phone is pretty much a part of your body. So what's next phase? People having sex. You really think it's actual fake people. Flashlights that have emotions. It's the fucking same emotions. You can turn it off the emotions that would get people dick hard. I do like porn where this seems to be having fun more than porn. Whereas people seem to be,

Speaker 5:          01:23:06       you know, I just watched the other day that was just random. People like watching porn where people fight and then they fuck. And then when they fuck the, like, you know, get back at each other and then resolve their issues through fucking like people liked those. They like videos like that when people were actually angry at each other because that's when they have their best sucks. A lot of people have the best sex they ever have. It's makeup sex. Like this girl that will like. I firmly believe they have learned to start fights so that the man will step in, are you with them for a little bit? Then they resolve everything they make up. They say they love you and then they fuck. And they love it and they have like super extra charge fucking. So I think they start problems and men and women I'm sure because they like a store.

Speaker 5:          01:23:47       It's why women can read a pornographic things and men need to see them. It's women like the story the women liked what leads up to having the foreplay sold. They like drama crazy for you like it to have a beginning, middle and end. And then the and has to go on for longer than we want it to. Have you ever thought what it would be like to be a woman for a day or every 10 years that microwave with the cantaloupe? Dang. Brian's life would be not much different. He would just be a lesbian. No, I, I, I've said this before where when I was younger I would like look at my boobs and act like they were real boobs and then try to kiss him, but that's about as close as to. That's the question though. If you're. Are you a girl for a day?

Speaker 5:          01:24:34       Who wants cock? Are you a girl for a day and go for the whole experience? Oh, I wish you'd get fucked too. I wouldn't want the. I would probably be interesting to feel what it would feel like to get fucked, but I couldn't do the memory is a dick in me. Yeah. And in your mouth to stop. No, no. Thanks. Mentioned period would be like, I'm a girl for a day. I'm going to convert to being a. don't they say Jewish girls don't don't like to blow. No. Jewish girls love to do it. That's crazy nonsense. I love it. Oh wait, isn't there some sort of girls that don't don't like to blow dudes or is that just girls in general? I don't know. It's just always going to be dudes complaining because that's what. That's what's fun about porn that you can't often get a girl that you're just hooking up with or whatever in porn that they often act like it's the most delicious thing could have. So I know most girls are just started like just doing, just doing what they gotta do to get it over with. Some girls know, some girls love Derek. You've got to find them. You know why it's kind of gross of a girl sucking your cock and she doesn't want to.

Speaker 5:          01:25:46       Doesn't want to like wants to please you, but also doesn't think it's the most delicious thing. She's like eating pussy. Don't get any posts. I do, I love it. But how could anybody think I love the pleasing the person is or maybe a little sense of control is the most important part than then

Speaker 8:          01:26:04       how it tastes and looks and feels. Those are all good too, but you know, I think that it's more like, it's just fun. It's just fun to, you know, because that's a great way to please a woman, Doug Benson and putting it out there,

Speaker 1:          01:26:17       bitches as, as you will. How often do you eat out,

Speaker 8:          01:26:26       have, you know,

Speaker 1:          01:26:27       whenever it's there, whenever the time is right, maybe some brunch will be some happy hour

Speaker 8:          01:26:35       maybe after dinner as eating. What does that mean? Eating ass licking a girl's asshole

Speaker 1:          01:26:41       don't like that. I love when people, when you talk about something and they go, yeah, and then they say, no, no, no, don't do that. I did. It's awesome. Frenching it. That's a no, but that's an immediate reaction. You know when someone says, yeah, I don't think so. You know, it's like that's what that same Dusky guy should have said when they asked him why you were attracted to young boys. Yeah, I don't think so. No. Instead he's like, he repeated like asked me again if I eat a lot of ass. Are you, do you eat a lot of ass too? I eat a lot of. No, I don't eat a lot of. It was the world's greatest athlete. That's a world champion. Well, the stacks of theater don't eat enough. This should totally be trophies for the best

Speaker 8:          01:27:26       assay eating. That's a God damn adventure. You can get trophies for parasailing. Who should get trophies for ass eating. Why not asking in contests? What if the world were free and we weren't so worried about things. Pornography could be judged on the merits of technique. Zero percent toilet paper in the ass is always important. That's very important. Toilet paper when you, when you go down on a girl and you find toilet paper just dangling off her ass and so disturbing that it's probably one of the things that keeps me out of that, out of that region. It's just could backfire. I had back in so it's not ruin anything. I don't want her to be upset. I get a little stubble. It's like essentially, you know, it's like a little bit of sandpaper. You rubbed some toilet paper on some sandpaper. You're gonna leave some residue. Do you like stuff in your ass?

Speaker 1:          01:28:16       No. No. You said that. I'm actually very scared. I was like, this is the end of a long conversation like stuffing your ass.

Speaker 8:          01:28:25       I'm very scared of my ass. I don't know if I told her. It's just, it's good I guess in my diet. That's good. Your meat diet, how often are you vegetables? I eat them every day, but that's just, I don't know what you should do is what I do and I just need to get on, get on the Kale shakes. I'm telling you. It's not that delicious, but I don't mind eating Kale so much. I kind of picked that up every once in a while. Like the whole foods or something like along with the. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Not Bad, but a shake of Kevin James turned me onto this shit and um, he started doing it in the lost like 80 pounds when he's doing essentially

Speaker 3:          01:29:02       takes cucumbers, Kale, celery, this, how I do it, cucumbers, Kale, celery, and I put a chunk of ginger in there too. And a whole pear ginger anymore. It drives me crazy. I think. I hate gender like that. I like to put some gas in there. Yeah, pull the last name. I like the sting of ginger. I like that. Yeah, it's very spicy, but I liked that it's good for you and so anyway, I blend it all up in this vitamix thing. You ever see a vitamix? It's like a mixer designed to to pulverize it. It's not really juicing because it's just chopping the living fuck out of all these vegetables until it's like a soup and then you drink this soup and it's fucking. It's not bad. It doesn't taste bad. It's just sort of a task and you lose weight because you're losing weight, vegetables and there's no other feeling bad.

Speaker 3:          01:29:51       You feel it's a giant serving of vegetables, like much more vegetables probably than you would ever really eat. Oh yeah. You have to force myself to eat. Most of it can eat like six giant leaves of Kale, 10 stalks of Celery, a whole cucumber. It's rare that you would eat that many vegetables in one sitting. You could do it, but this is even better because it's completely taken the whole chewing down process out. So you're. You're digesting it, you're swallowing it, and it's like just incinerated, just chopped up into little tiny pieces and it's like really easily absorbed by your body and your shit's magnifical. The shits become easier because. So lubed up to though do your whole system is just whenever you have. If you have a steak later, it slides out like a Toboggan for your vitamix Joe. This is a late night drink, like with some food vodka, ice, a red seedless grapes, like a lot of red seat lit, scrapes and a little bit to apples and it's, it's a, it's kind of like grape Fyedka, but like it's got a little bit of a texture to it.

Speaker 3:          01:30:55       It's cool. Wow, I love that. That's a great idea. So you make like a little smoothing mega little smitty and if you, if you have any, uh, not, um, what's that sweetener that's made out of a cactus or something like that? If you have any of that, put that in there. Dva? Yeah. You can use to Gaba. Gaba, I use the Gaba. Gaba is not so good for you. It's why not? I don't know. I read that somewhere I need to research that somebody had said that a Gaba is not good for you. I think like any artificial sweeteners, so it's, it's a, they make a tequila out of it. Yeah. But it's a plant is a plant and it's a real sweet plant and you know, that's uh, somehow or another they make to kill out of that process. So that word a lot associated with. I made lemonade the other day with it, with the garbage. It was really delicious, but I was drinking. I was like, it's probably not so good for you. Why? Why? No? Stevia is supposed to be good for you, but Stevia to me is not like a real sweet taste. It's like a trick. Sweet. Yeah. It's like a, almost like an aspirin. What was that old shit? Sweet

Speaker 1:          01:32:00       and lows. Sweet and low hip. Funky fucking. It was kind of sweet, but kind of funky. I kinda like it better than, than any other. But the problem I have is they need to have it at more places. Like starbucks seems like it should have starbucks. I don't think people. I think it's a taste issue. I don't prefer the taste of it. I think it's probably something you can get used to, but I don't like and things. I don't mind. Things being not sweet, you know what I mean? Like coffee. I don't want coffee, sweetened, sweetened, iced tea, iced tea. I just drink it, you know? Yeah. I don't put any extra shit into pretty much anything really. You want your health, do you? What? Do you take care of herself? I go through periods that are, you know, can go up and down. No, I don't think I've ever eaten. Kick in bed. Never. I don't think so. What about in the tub?

Speaker 1:          01:32:48       I don't think I've ever eaten food in the tub. That's the cat in the hat. Comes back. He kicked in the tub and it becomes a mess. That motherfucker to paraphrase it that way. When you read that to your children, this is my kids' favorite stories. They're fun because I get into them or get into the cat in the hat once brilliantly written stuff. Frog and toad. You got to get them in the frog and toad. Okay. That's the best. Remember that frog and toad frog and attend that live together and they were sort of vaguely remember that or they were trying to cross the highway and you have to. It was cool. Get into the lily pads. That's frogger. It's weird that a frog would hang with the toad the other different yet. So this lucky frogs a little. Those cons. You know how he will be.

Speaker 1:          01:33:31       If they're big, they'll just be taking kids right out of your arm and you seen big frog. They're pretty big. I mean big like real big like dog size. The frogs were huge. They eat babies and was about a frog recent researching frogs long time ago because of that, licking frogs and so I got really into frogs and they have pac man frog. He received PAC man frogs or mouth's open up like PAC man. Frog is a ruthless motherfuckers. You know, they. They were like my. Sometimes my might have made that up. They do those frogs that he dug. Man. How about the fact that people take frogs and they get high with them? That's why I was researching frogs because frogs off Ebay a long time. I got to something like that. You can buy that. I don't know if they've made a frog illegal yet. What is the frog that does it? The frog. It producers five Meo DMT is really incredibly potent. Helis engine and will you do is you take this frog and the skin excretes like some sort of a white milky substance and you do it on a window of a car so that it's in the sun or anything glass that's outside glass coffee table. You secrete it and then when it dries off, you scrape it with a razor blade and it becomes a white powder. You put it in something, you freebase it and you blast off.

Speaker 9:          01:34:49       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:34:50       Welcome to the center of the universe provided by a frog. Do you think that's why they ended up what? I was going to be a bunch of frogs on us

Speaker 8:          01:34:57       because we're all going to start tripping off these frogs because it's going to be frogs everywhere and then we're going to go into this Dm. Treaties are likely. That's tripping off of how justice hallucinogen Hallucinogen, hallucinogen hallucinogen. That's the correct agenda is what I'm used to it as well. It's like nuclear or new cuellar. You're going to have options. Other options. If I said nuclear, would you correct? It's like authentically often nuclear coupon and coupon nuclear bombs, nuclear bombs. I don't think I are correct. You out loud. I would just assume. I know. I just assumed you were gonna you know like you hear in both ways so often. Like if all the dumb things that George Bush said and did that one to me it was like, well, but a lot of people say it the wrong way, so you just get used to it.

Speaker 8:          01:35:46       It's just like old expressions that now people say I'm the wrong the wrong way. With English. People write things different. They right there. Correct. Tires is t y r e S. I kept seeing that written an English magazine. I was like, why is the world world? It's spelled w r o l d instead of w o r, l, D, real world. It's pronounced wrong. Wrong. Did you just make that up? I always get, I say world and everyone gives me shift. So you make that up. No, it's not spelled war. Made that up. Yes. You motherfucker. Color color. They have and color. Yeah. There's a bunch of different. It's funny when you reading tweets, you don't even have to look to see where the person's from. When it's got those things in it. Well they also say cheers mate, and they always say, you're a legend isn't legend's mate.

Speaker 8:          01:36:37       You're a legend. Right? I think that's just huge. Joe Calls Me and says, you are a legend. I love that expression. The love that they love, they love. Brilliant. It's a brilliant, brilliant, great. That's another one. They retired and con. They like to say, I like how you publicly announced that when you band people on twitter, like you're like, you are banned. No blurry, blocked, blocked. But sometimes I'm just kidding. Like sometimes I'll just take some dumb tweet, the Kim Kardashian road or something and I'll say blog or irl, you know, somebody will write something to me that's actually kind of Nice and I'll write block just to be silly and I'll write to them and say, I didn't really block you, I just, I just wanted to retweet what you said. But I also, I don't like just retweet and compliments and stuff because I just think that that's true to compliment than say blocked.

Speaker 8:          01:37:21       That's funny because then everybody gets a lot out of it. Like, oh, he's such an asshole. That guy that said that nice thing, you know, but I just think that like there's just too much, too many people that just want, they're all about getting retweets and like begging for them and it's just like, that's kind of whacked. The whole retweet thing. I respond to people as much as I can, but that, that is kind of whack. Yeah, you're good with people though. You like answer questions and stuff. I just get the same questions all the time. People always ask me because I follow for under 20 people. I thought that'd be funny thing on my side, on my page and it says I follow under 20 people,

Speaker 5:          01:37:56       but then also that's like about how many people I want to follow. Like if there's somebody that I'm not interested in anymore and I want to add somebody, I'll drop somebody in ad I just keep it in 20. Oh. Then a lot of people get it right away. They don't ask to be added because they're like, I don't want to ruin your for 20 thing dude, but I'd love it if you added me or whatever, but do. Does anybody more connected to the pop movement and you. I don't know. I'm not. I'm not as political as people might want me to be about it. Although I've got some news for you guys. I'd love to share with your listeners slash viewers. Sure. In Missouri in 2012, there's a chance of getting outright legalization on the ballot. Really skipping over. They're skipping over the medical thing.

Speaker 5:          01:38:38       They just need x number of signatures and it's not that many. They just need a certain number of signatures to get it to happen and they need the signatures by May. So if you're in Missouri, get ahold of like your local normal chapter, you know, nor nrml is, that's how Brian's always spelled normal. How many and uh, and, and just make sure you find out where you can go because it's has to be physical signatures, which is the most fucked up thing in this computer age. People should be able to sign petitions now on their computer onlines and some do like the Conservatives get lots of good petitions going online, but for to get on the ballot for legalization in Missouri, which I would love because there's a lot of cities in Missouri that I like and if I got to go there and know that it was legal, it was so much fun. Well, you know, marijuana is legal in Denver pretty much. Yeah. They give you some sort of ticket. They don't, they don't. You're like blowing it on A. I think it's one of those.

Speaker 5:          01:39:35       I'm sure you're not supposed to be out there publicly drinking, just like you're not supposed to be out there publicly smoking pot, but then other people are pretty chill. Yeah. Then on stopping people at all, there's a lot of cities and and you know, there's 16 states in Washington dc that are our medical, but then a lot of cities it's been, you know, kind of because I think it's, it's been kind of quietly decriminalized and a lot of places, a lot of those states though, it's really hard to get a license. It's not as easy as it is. Yeah. And it's really hard to. The whole dispensary system isn't in place, you know, and that's the problem currently in California is that the feds are again threatening to cut two to basically close down dispensary's and then the question is, well where did the patients, because they've seen me, there seemed to be okay with patients at this point.

Speaker 5:          01:40:20       Like if you're a medical marijuana patient, you should be able to get it, but where the patient's going to get it, if they close down the dispensary because they're supposed to grow their own or have some sort of concern from the law enforcement is that there's a lot of profit being made that is not supposed to be according to the way the law is structured. It's there. You're not supposed to be able to profit as much as these people are profiting. But the bottom line is that should be the very last thing that law enforcement is devoting its resources to. You know, no one's getting hurt there. Okay, so you're all, your attention should be devoted to crime. All your attention should be devoted to reckless drivers. Drunk drivers, crime, assault, violent crime associated with marijuana would go away. It was like, oh yeah, just leave it alone and I swear everything will be better.

Speaker 5:          01:41:13       It's really simple. You know, there's, there's other shit to concentrate on, but I think also that in some cases places need arrests. They need to make arrests and it's a fucking easy collar. It's not hard. No one's going to shoot you in your closing down a pot store, you know, you go there, you bring guys who are dressed like they're ready to go to war in Afghanistan and they fucking go in there with machine guns and they clear everything out and they take everything. And it's crazy man. You know, the, the ones that, uh, they had an la a few years back where they had the guys who were, had blackwater uniforms on, they had, there were blackwater guys, they hired mercenaries to go in there and clean up and close down these pot shops. And you're like, because of the weirdest rates like in. So you remember that though? Do you remember that shit in, in super high. We show two different rates and uh, and one of the biggest laughs in the movies, the unfortunately not me speaking. Uh, so somebody that's just a, you know, a protest or advocate that's hanging outside of place. It's being rated a yells at the guys as they're walking downstairs, have boxes full of marijuana and money yells at him. Go bust a meth lab. You Pussy.

Speaker 5:          01:42:22       No Shit, no shit. It's so easy, it's an easy color, it's weak you, you know, it's wrong. And I'm sure a lot of the guys that are involved in doing those things, again, they're just following orders. They're just like, you know, there's absolutely. That's the. I get, I guess people in law enforcement more and more saying, hey to me and winking at me and say I like your work and stuff and kissing on the lips. A lot of making out. I just, I just will not. I just draw the line at eating their ass. Don't try that line, bro. Sacrifice. I gotta try it. I just think of assets as being, you know, I just said a very juvenile attitude towards assets. Make them do a stripper shower before and I don't want anything in my ass. He even as Nice, soft tongue. I always say the cops don't get nearly enough credit and there's a, there's a divide between the citizens and the police.

Speaker 5:          01:43:10       It doesn't have to exist. It's ridiculous. They should be supported, you know, and people support troops. But very few people support cops. There's bad cops for sure, but it's a small percentage. We get to see how how good cops are though, because we're usually in situations where it's, it's sort of, you know, especially you like wherever you see a lot of law enforcement, that's kind of it. They're sort of protecting you and you know, just being out in public and stuff. Right. I don't really have protected me when I'm out in public. When, when they see you, they're like, you're a celebrity to them. So you're like, the last thing there cops are going to do is hassle you. That's true. But you know, also when I pulled over when I wasn't

Speaker 3:          01:43:52       a celebrity, I'm polite. You, you, you asked me a question? No Sir. He asked me for my license. I gave a true. It's true. You respectful. Yeah. I, I've gotten out of a few arrests situations by just being polite. Cup knows you're legitimately respectful, you know, they appreciate that. You know, like man, that's the fucking job. The job is. We agree that guy gets the gun and the fucking flashing lights and you listen to him. Yes sir. No Sir. And that means you're a good citizen and you're not trying to fucking cause any trouble. And in turn he doesn't, you know, take advantage of this power that's presented to him by this willingness for people to obey. And he doesn't automatically assume that everybody owes it to them. And that's the problem with older cops. That's the problem with these white shirt concedes. He punching people in these occupy Wall Street crowds.

Speaker 3:          01:44:34       They, they think they can punch people. You know, there, there's ones and it's not all of them, it's just a small fraction of it, but they feel like they're better than people. They feel like they've been older and people around. People who have been forced to listen to them so long that they have a complex. They've been involved in law enforcement for 30 years and you have to fucking listen to them, you know? Yeah. They're bullies. There are bullies. You know, you give people ultimate power, you're going to get ultimate corruption. We all know that. And even though you don't think of that as corruption, that has absolutely corruption. When that guy, that guy white shirt and the video punches that chicken the face, that's fucking corruption. That is a hundred percent corruption. That's all. Somebody told me, that chick, that's actually a very feminine man.

Speaker 3:          01:45:12       Either way I say it's a chick, chick, chick, chick like dude. And the guy punches him right in the face with a very sloppy overhand right to it's piss poor technique. I really was very, very upset with this video tested correctly. No, no. I mean just take that video and then do the play by play. Like you're doing it for a fight. Who the fuck taught him how to throw that right hand and for 102 pound check she takes it. Well, she took it wells, weak ass punch. But you know, the fact that he thought that he could do that. I don't care what that person said. Damn. You know, if someone's yelling at you and causing you calling you names and becoming a problem and you have to arrest him, then he fucking arrest them. You don't have to punch people in the fucking head.

Speaker 3:          01:45:55       You Dick. What do you think about the, um, the preponderance of a Taser incidents and uses of tasers everywhere. Ridiculous. Not just tasers. How about the flash bombs they're throwing on people? Did you see that shit? That was a guy was a wounded vet. The whole thing is disgusting. It's really disgusting. It's like these cops are, you know, they're forced everyday to go out there and try to combat this ever growing thing that has shows no signs of weakening in fact shows signs of gaining momentum and strength. And that's why all these movements are being taken to try to squash it and try to suppress it because they go, well, we got to stop this now because right now it's 30,000 people, but the fuck do we do in it's 300,000 people out there. Guess what? They're going to come through those doors. Three hundred thousand people are going to come through those doors and they're gonna start throwing people out windows, you know? And I don't think they will. I mean it's not violent. It hasn't been a violent movement so far, but that's what they would do if they have 300,000 people,

Speaker 2:          01:46:50       so if you, if you think of, if you're like mayor Bloomberg or if you're, you know, on these fucking guys that owned some giant Hedge Fund and you've made billions of dollars is raping people your whole life and then all the sudden you know, you picture what you would do if you were all those people, you would think those people going to get me, they're going to come again in a storm. The gates, even if they stay nonviolent, these people are never gonna accept that because they're always gonna. Assume that human nature is always violence, so they're going to push these people back before it ever gets to a point where they can't control it and that's why they're there. Clearing these fucking tense out. That's where they're trying to. I guess they had an old library full of books there too, and they throw the books away.

Speaker 2:          01:47:28       What the fuck, man? You throw on books away. That should be against the law. Okay. Right there. That should be a crime in this day of age and age of ultimate retardation that we find ourselves in when people are so fucking dope that you're throwing books away. God Damn Man. You talk about someone who's not working for the greater good of the people cop that's throwing books away. Yeah, for the worst and all in the name of the supposedly name of public safety. So gross. Well, you know that chase paid the cops four point $6,000,000, made a huge donation to the cops. Of course. Isn't that ridiculous?

Speaker 4:          01:48:05       Everything. Everything behind everything is is is money now the money that these people that are going to try to defeat Obama, the money, the millions and millions that they're raising, that's all it's going to is just trying to win an election late. That's a messed up system. People are starving. Those millions of dollars could feed people and instead they're just putting somebody else in charge who's not who, you know, because Obama, as much as he seems to try is ineffective. Everything's gonna be ineffective. Whoever, if he loses, if he wins, if he wins, I think is next for years can be kind of interesting because he'll kind of have nothing to fucking lose.

Speaker 2:          01:48:43       Is that true though, man? I hope so. You know, I don't buy that anymore because I just haven't seen any evidence whatsoever that he has any power at all. I just, I don't, I don't necessarily believe it. I think they, there's a whole group of people that have got him into position and once those people sit down with them, they explained to him what they would like to get done and that's what gets done. And that's why Guantanamo Bay still open. That's why

Speaker 4:          01:49:07       still slips through the cracks. Like there's no, there's no money interests that wanted to get rid of. Don't ask, don't tell. And he made that happen.

Speaker 2:          01:49:14       Yeah. That's a bone that he through people. That's the bones go. It's pretty good. Yeah. It's good. That good? Yeah. You know what that means. That means that gay people are to become hired killers too. Yay. The fuck kind of advancement is that. Well, they can, you know, gay people, you know, it's not, it's not that I'm and I'm, I'm 100 percent not anti soldier whatsoever. The show I am for the soldiers would I'm not for is the people that tell the soldiers what to do. Every fucking army needs soldiers. Every nation needs an army because guess what? Human nature is what it is. There's a lot of bad fucking people in the world. What makes me sick is when bad people take good soldiers and make them do bad shit, and they do that for their own good. So it's not that I'm against soldiers.

Speaker 2:          01:49:57       I'm 100 percent for soldiers, soldiers. Those are people that understand. What I'm not for is the people that put soldiers in situations where the soldiers think they're doing the right thing because they're following orders. They think they're doing the right thing because they're going after guys who look like bad guys, but the big question ever gets answered, what the fuck are you doing there in the first place? You think you're doing the right thing. What the fuck are you doing there in the first place? You're going to stop another nine slash 11. Those guys are dead. They're all dead. The guys who did it are dead. This is how you stop it. You don't. Don't let that happen,

Speaker 8:          01:50:25       but I can get everybody over here. Fucking more soldiers. The everybody watches this more carefully. Yeah, keep. Keep America safe. Soldiers. The TSA employee

Speaker 2:          01:50:34       just keep. Can't deny the economic reasons for going over there. You can't deny it mean in the middle of this peak oil crisis. Everybody's freaking out about what happens when we run out of oil. Is it possible to run out of oil? What happens if the prices skyrocket to the point where we get a massive recession and so that's the reason why we go over there. We go over there to control the oil. Do we go over there because there's not much left. I mean, what? What's really going on? Let me know.

Speaker 8:          01:51:02       You think that all this is leading up to the protest. You know, getting the troops back here, like all this is just gonna lead to something like a new hands across America and I knew we are the world. We already have to go through something like that again. Get already. Is there your hands across America? The only thing I'm worried about is the. We are the world parodies that stand up college would close their acts with. That's what I'm worried about. 11 meaning, you know the Kevin meaning I remember hands across America but I don't remember if I did it or not. I remember I don't think it worked right. It didn't work. It was fake and they just edited things together. It was like, wow, look how far it goes. All the way to the codes were transferred from person to person. That one, I don't know if I stood somewhere and held hands with two people on the street somewhere or not.

Speaker 8:          01:51:48       I think my uncle told me it was if I didn't. Well it's what we were talking about every seven years. You get some shape files. The Ellis sort. That's been a while since that happened. I think my hands across America shouldn't have caused you that much inconvenience, Brian, as an individual. It's not that big a deal, Brian. This is the worst fear that you're in. Fear of another we other world song. That's so not what's going on here. What's going on here? Some overthrow the government type shit. That's what's going on here. And what's going on here is people saying, Hey, this system right now, it doesn't fucking work at all. The only time in our life that I've ever seen this, never seen anything even remotely close to it. Know every president, uh, in my lifetime has raised taxes at a point where taxes need to be raised. It's never been this crazy. It's never been this.

Speaker 2:          01:52:35       There's never been this much discontent. It never been giant protests all over the world. They have occupied Toronto. So

Speaker 8:          01:52:41       guess what? Toronto is doing great. They're doing awesome. Yeah, it seems like they have a good economy. They're,

Speaker 3:          01:52:46       they're, they're, you know, they don't have nearly the problems with unemployment that we have there. They're fucking doing pretty good up there. A lot better than we're doing, man, but people are still like, fuck it. It's not good enough. Was it the 55,000 people at Rogers Center? Was that the most people at one UFC event ever? Yeah. Yeah. That was epic. Yeah. And those, those, those tickets aren't cheap though. The record is actually being held by. Um, I think the, I think in Japan they've had 90,000 people. Really? Yeah. I think that's what the biggest they've ever had. No, it wasn't the UFC, it was pride, pride events. I'm pretty sure during the peak of mixed martial arts they had something like 80,000 plus people, which is really insane when you think about it because when we did the UFC it was 55, but then they released an additional 5,000 seats and they sold them to.

Speaker 3:          01:53:34       So it turned out to be $60,000. It was just, they had to figure out how many seats they could have and bringing all the equipment because it was a completely different show. It was really stressful for everyone doing it because they had these giant fucking tvs everywhere. So everything is being shown on these 80 foot fucking tvs mean. It's a huge place, man. And you could. People were watching it from the hotel that's really wild. The back of the Roger Center has a fucking hotel with windows wide open and you could look. People had rooms where they could look out their window and watched the fight. That's awesome. Fucking. I didn't even see that dude. It's the shit. That place is huge. They played baseball in there, man. I'm going to wrap your head around that. Well, is that the only place where um, they, they gave us a earphones.

Speaker 3:          01:54:21       They gave us these things that we put in our, in our ears to listen to you call the, the matches. You can get those anywhere. Everywhere. Yeah. They're the only place anybody's ever walked up to me and said, here, do you want this? You know, they were just giving them out to people for some reason in Toronto. Oh, that's. So I listened the whole time. I think you should get it with your ticket. You know, you're paying a fuck load for a ticket anyway. They just hand them bitches out when they get in the door. That'd be a nice thing. It's only 10 bucks and you can reuse it at every UFC event. Yeah. Yeah. I don't, I don't know what ended up happening with the one that I had because you know, I smoke a lot of pot. Smoke a lot of pot, don't you?

Speaker 3:          01:54:56       Especially in Toronto. Toronto's awesome. Do you ever do that pot club where you. Yeah, you told me about it and then I did it this next time I was there. We shouldn't say the name because I don't know how easy it is to get in trouble for that, but I don't think it studies either. I don't know, but they're all pretty, pretty fucking chill there. I'm pretty sure they have a vote really soon on decriminalization. You know, I think there's something going on there. I don't know the exact specifics of their situation with their law, but it was deemed that the way the law was written, the cannabis laws were unconstitutional and uh, they only had a certain amount of time to fight that. And they're in the midst of it right now. I'm pretty sure it's going to be decided sometime before the end of the year, before the end of December.

Speaker 3:          01:55:40       I believe. That's cool. Yeah. Really interpret their, their attitude towards. It was amazing up there. As is NBC. They just fucking, you know, BC has medical now too. If you have a California license you can go to basically takes up. I was just there for just for a night and I had, I had a blast. I love going to Canada. So greatest city in the country. Canada, Canada's greatest city in our country. Know the, the, the greatest city in Canada is. It is. You know what, there's no bad one. I, there's a, it's a tossup between Vancouver, like the most fun I've ever had between Vancouver, Toronto, and Montreal. Those are the three big cities that I performed out. I would say it's a toss up. You know, the only thing in Montreal you get people, there's a certain amount of people that don't necessarily speak English that well.

Speaker 3:          01:56:24       It's a little more French. Most people are bilingual, but there's a certain percent of the girls, but also that could effect a reaction a little bit, a little comedy because the language difference, we get that a little bit, but a damn those girls are hot chocolate with a French accent, but when they're being horrible brawls though, even when they're being mean to you, what they have horrible bras. Bras. I've been with two of those French Canadian girls and they both had really creepy. I think that says more about girls who want to fuck you. Love that. I love that you're sampling to girls. Is a statement like that. That's his gallery too. I was with had terrible bras and did it. You'd never know. Duke countries have like, things like browser more important, like style wise, like you know, like old, old woman underwear. Like is there a country want to stay warm when you were there with chicks?

Speaker 3:          01:57:15       Wanted to stay warm. They throw less emphasis on sexy underwear in Montreal and the winter man. Oh son and get cold. I, I, uh, used to do the old, uh, I should do Jimbo comedy works in Montreal. I still do that. Did it last time I was there was a great little small club. It only seats like 100 people. I should do it like way, way back in the day when I do the Montreal comedy festival. But uh, I walked from my hotel to a, the club because it was only a few blocks. That's all I got there every day is, you know, long time ago and it was minus 15, minus 16, I think it was something like that. And I walked to the club and it was ruthlessly painful dude. It was ruthlessly painful. Like my ears felt like they're going to fall off my head. You had to have a wool hat, like you had to have ear covers.

Speaker 3:          01:57:59       It's not like a looks thing like you have to have, should wear a ski mask, ski masks, you should wear a ski mask because your face gets ripped apart by the cold air. Fuck that noise. I'm not a fan of that. So I guess we just officially decided Vancouver's because in the wintertime it's just got like Portland weather or Seattle. Vancouver is pretty fucking bad ass. That's the cool people are as cool as fuck. That is one of the most marijuana influence cities in the world. Oh yeah. One of the most. The movie that I was in the union, the business of getting high. Have you ever watched that? So, uh, my friend Adam scored, he did it and it's all about the, the economy in Vancouver and how much of it is based around marijuana and how insane it is, you know, the American laws and the horseshoe that goes on with legalization.

Speaker 3:          01:58:46       But it's a great documentary on how ridiculous the whole scenario is. The fact that it's illegal in the first place we should vaporize when we talk about this, you think that things are ready to roll? How long could it possibly take? But it's flashing red light flashing the whole time. I'm not supposed to be solid when it's right. I don't want to say the name of this product because I don't want to give this guy a bad review because he seems like a real nice guy. Isn't the red light you talking about? Hold on, let's try and see if it works. Give it a shot

Speaker 8:          01:59:16       tomorrow. Yeah. Tomorrow we have a death squad comedy show at the Pasadena Ice House. The dog will be there, won't be doing a podcast beforehand. So the podcast starts eight PM Pacific. So it's going to be the same deal where people can watch it live. They can watch it live and we're going to have a John Reap a little esther. I'm Yoshi. Wait, is this a comedy show or a video game company? So I like that video game with little estrogen Yossi. Try to get, get into the castle. A asshole Joe is trying to. Allegedly. You think it works? Yeah, it works. I'm just, you know, I'd like to try it. You do it looks Kinda like sucking a cock though. And you know, I'm against that. Do you, do you usually use vaporizers or what's your huh? Like way better for. I don't have any usual. I have a myriad of ways to uh, to get thc into my system.

Speaker 8:          02:00:18       I had a lollipop in the car on the way over here. You animal fucking savage. Those are good. And then, you know, and then people always have joints around that you smoke and I'm not a joint roller myself. I'm not a, I don't have those skills. I make apps so easy to make apples into pipes whenever I'm in hotels because they always have them in the lobby and. But don't you feel like you're getting a lot of the butane from the lighter in your mouth? Don't you taste that shit when you inhale it through an apple? Anytime you use anything? We have to highlight the weed. We liked the weed over and over again. You know that the joints is your light at once and you could light it with a match. Yeah, that's a good. That's a good point. But I just like with joints it's almost become more like a social thing for me.

Speaker 8:          02:00:58       Like I never just sit and smoke a joint by myself and, and, and you don't get, you don't get big hits off of it. I like, I like, you know, that's why like you don't get big hits, you're such a fucking still. And we'll give you a little pin joint or something. I'm like, oh, that's fun to pretend we're smoking polo. Little tiny joint. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But you know, I'd rather have a blunt that adjoin and pipe over go do, you know? And then Bong bongs really like I hit them so rarely now that they really knocked me on my ass, you know, and like, especially like somebody put some like fucking hash oil in there or something because I'm really getting used to just smoke and vaporizer in my apartment and you know, and, and, and doing a lot of edibles. So my smoking game is coming, coming down, you know, like smoking game bonds will show you, glitches in the Matrix.

Speaker 8:          02:01:50       Bongs, you'll, you'll have moments with the same exact thing. Is repeated a second later. What, what? There is this house that I lived in where I, in college I lived with seven girls and it was a two story house. It was like, just like the railroad and we made a bong out of PCP that went from the first story. See PCP bro, bro. Crazy man. We made fucking pipes out of agile dosh and it went to the second floor. It was like so huge and there was one guy that could clear the whole thing, just hit it, just hit it. Just said it like it's a like, it's a son, doesn't feel like it's doing anything. Does it? Was it clouding up? It doesn't. Sam, he sounds like a. A teapot. Yeah. The little tea pot. Short and stout here.

Speaker 8:          02:02:44       Really powerful professional stoner professional stoner. Doug Benson approves of this device. Yeah. My seemed like a pretty good, pretty good hit. W, what do you know about this nonsense that the ATF was going to stop people from getting new firearms if you were a medical marijuana patient now you heard this. I've heard stuff to that effect in that. Sounds. Sounds pretty. It sounds nutty, but it's also. It doesn't hit me at home because I don't, you know, I'm not a firearms guy. Well, I understand that. For me, I wish everybody. I wish everybody had guns was high fight. You think more about your fellow man before you pull the trigger. It's disgusting. It's disgusting. Like he don't like. I, I hate that when people kind of paint this idea that you could just that poc and somehow, I mean, I guess there's some people that can make kind of crazy, but for the most part it doesn't, it doesn't make you have visions or do things that you like, like with alcohol where you do things that you wouldn't do if you weren't drunk.

Speaker 8:          02:03:47       There's weed doesn't really have that. I mean not full or something, you know what I mean? Like behind the wheel of a car, how many people do you know or like when they're high and driving, they're maniacs in there and dangerous and you know, more of a threat than the old chart. The cop pulls you over, do you know why I pulled you over? You're going three miles an hour. You're not parked. But even then, you know, like every once in a while, like I, I've been trying to write down lately, every time I do something stupid and when I'm not high, I'm not, I'm, I'm not high like maybe an hour out of every day. So it's a small window because whether you do your taxes. Yeah, I could do my taxes high too. I mean I used to, I now I have an account. Doesn't freak you out though.

Speaker 8:          02:04:27       It does, but you double check it, you know, like text to the, when you're high and you're leaving a hotel room, you, you, you, you pace around the room three or four times to make sure you got all of items. And then one time out of five you left something behind and you're just going to have to buy it. Check your pocket for $20 to buy a new iphone adapter at the airport power adapter. And I lose it every time I leave the house more than $20. Those things. Yeah, they're pricey. They're like 100 bucks or they really. Yeah. But what I did was I bought phone power adapters. A 100 bucks or no, uh, you know, for the laptop, for laptop, you know, those ones with the big white square. Okay. And uh, but those things I know last a couple over the years and then I just finally got wise and bought two and I travel with one and have one at home.

Speaker 8:          02:05:15       Yeah, I do the same thing. I have a laptop at least. At least when I get back home, it's there and I'm ready to go. I was so confused. I thought you were just talking about iphone adapters. I'm like, how the fuck are they charge 100 bucks. 30 bucks though. Apple just released a recall on power adapters and it's funny. It's about time they did something about this because I've seen this on both my power adapters for laptops and I phones where the cord kind of comes out of the plug. Have you seen that? Yeah, yeah. Yeah. And so finally the recalling it right now, the new ones are much more sturdy

Speaker 3:          02:05:49       new ones though. They're like waste 30. Yeah. Yeah. Technology man. It's adapting. That seems to be the fucking bottleneck though, is battery life, the real battle battery life. You have to be connected to power. You know, real battery life was just not substantial interest for power everywhere now. Yeah. But the real question is, will there ever be some sort of an infinite battery source or some sort of an amazing battery source where shit last forever, but the print power, how can you do that though? How is something storing power? You know, it would have to be like or something. Yeah, something like that. But I'm, I'm pretty cool with how it is. I don't, I don't get caught off guard by my computer, you know, running out. Look, I'm, I'm, I'm amazed that it works at all. You know, the whole device is incredible. Especially I know a lot of people I had a conversation with is very, very intelligent lady, but she was talking to me about a windows and she only uses windows and the reason why she only uses windows is because she doesn't like being told what forum she buys her computers in.

Speaker 3:          02:06:50       She wants to be able to pick her own parts and different, different things and I understand that. But the rational part of me goes, yeah, but macs don't have viruses and they work better. Done. That conversation's over like. Yeah, I, yeah. I would rather you know anybody, but the reason why they work so good is because there's not a billion different douche bags making these computers with all these different parts and you know, the, the, the operating system has to figure out how the drivers to each individual device work.

Speaker 8:          02:07:17       I just think this is a shitty operating system. It used to be good and then they went to like, you know, xp was, what is it that now windows eight is it seven, seven, 77 and I just think it's the Shitty, like I don't like it. I like Osx and then when it comes to most things you buy for your computer nowadays, everything's USB. If it doesn't, you don't have to have like what are you really doing it? If you didn't have a computer, windows would be awesome. If somebody gave you a windows seven computer in 1995, you would have, you would shoot a load all over your keyboard. You would be so excited, but things have changed drastically at one point. Totally. I remember I couldn't believe you actually controlling that white line, which I'm moving on screen and it's fun to get good at it.

Speaker 8:          02:08:02       That was another one. I was good at. Pong. Yeah. Real good at the one where you play, where you play against the machine or whatever. Yeah, that was great. That really freestone or days to. Right. That was the one I was really good at is my parents used to go to a lay priesthood days. My parents used to go to a bar at a, at a golf course. There was also a restaurant, so they'd hang out there and you know, they just bring me along or whatever. And they had like that. It was almost like my babysitter was playing with the fucking pong machine while my parents had some cocktails and uh, I got so good at that. And also you used to be able to get free games on pong by the metal thing in the front that you, that you put the quarters into the slot if you rubbed your feet on the ground and carpeting and built up static electricity and then had like a piece of metal in your hand like a quarter.

Speaker 8:          02:08:53       You could tap it just right and it would throw a credits onto the. Onto the machine. Yeah, I did it all the time or that I've, I've like, that is crazy. My life. I've always found all these weird scams that eventually like not only do they not save you a whole lot in the first place is twenty five cents, but they also over time become, you know, become worthless. But it's weird little skills you pick up just to just to cheat the, like the ski bus over and put it in the 50 and you just keep on getting those tickets and put it into throwing it in their tickets to animal that bad. So many tickets that we hadn't. Anything of value. There was always like one, like, like a beat box, like a, you know, you can't help that. We'd call the day and yeah. And you can't save up to get that many tickets.

Speaker 8:          02:09:48       A million tickets for this one. You thinking about how much money you spent, how much time of your life has gone rolling a stupid ball. Oh, all the things I've done that take time. Like the amount of time I've spent playing poker, the amount of time I spend watching dumb movies. How you a road poker player. Do you go to casinos when you do the road? That's what I'm in a gambling town or like I don't, I don't seek out casinos everywhere I go because a lot of places have them now because if Indian grounds or because you're on a boat on the river. But uh, I only, I only go if I'm playing the casino or you know, or I live across the street from it. That's part of what I love about going to see UFC in vegas is it gets me away from the tables for like five hours because. Yeah, because I'll just sit and play and play and play, you know, I love it, but it's such a waste of time.

Speaker 5:          02:10:35       But also, and it also at this point in my life, the thrill of winning a hand isn't really the same because I don't, I don't need the money as bad. You know, back when I was playing when I was like, you know, I, I could pay for rent next month in his hand. That was, it was a lot more exciting. Well, Ari should fear would one point in time was winning more money playing poker than he was making it, doing comedy for? He's a good player. I only played like we were the same table in one tournament once I think, but I, I, I got to vibe off of him like he really knows what he's doing because I still. There's still things that professional poker players could, could teach me that I could, I could stand to learn, but I'm just too lazy to learn.

Speaker 5:          02:11:16       Like you know, all the kinds of calculations you should be making during each hand. Like how exactly how much to bet and all that stuff. I'm just more like, you know, just goofing around. He was just having fun. You're not trying to be the best poker player in the world. No, but I'm trying. I'm trying to win through. Just playing like an asshole. You can play chess. I did. You know, when I was younger. I haven't haven't in a long time. That's a great obsession game. That game could drive people. Deepened the whole. Yeah. You could spend a lot of time on that. You can go crazy. You can really go mad and playing chess because for certain people it absorbs there everyday. Like there'll be walking down the street and there'll be thinking about moves. Like it starts. It starts getting to a point where you know, you, you see a direct result between the more concentrated you are, the more you concentrate on it, more that you focus on it, the more you start winning and the better you get at playing chess and then you just go.

Speaker 5:          02:12:06       You get lost, then you're crazy. Yeah. See, that's what I suggest doing poker is I don't like sit there and evaluate how everyone else is playing and what their personalities are and like, oh, what he did on that hand and then what he did on the next hand. Like I'm just like more, I'm just playing in the moment and I know when, you know, I know good cards when I see him or when I have a good chance of, you know, drawing a winning hand and I just sort of, you know, play like that. I did a movie once and the guy who was renting out the house, they rent out, you know, you want to shoot a movie in the house, you can rent someone's house like people offer them for rent and this guy was a professional chess player and um, so you know, a lot of downtime during movie.

Speaker 5:          02:12:43       So I'd go hang out with this guy and talk to them, try to figure out what he was doing. And he was playing chess online, you know, with all these different people. And he was like some super fucking master chess player. So it was a, it was fascinating that he's got this giant community of apparently you could just get chess games like anytime of the day, anytime of the night online, whatever level you're at, you know, and there's people from all over the world that would play chess with, you know, same thing with scrabble really. People are fucking nuts with the scrabble, scrabble computer downwards with like where they're playing against people all over the place. But you can see you can do it anytime you want. That's part of what I love about twitter is if I am like up in the middle of the night and not asleep for some reason because I got to go to the airport or whatever.

Speaker 5:          02:13:27       Can't sleep that. So great that like the, it's the, that it's international. Once you get a certain number of followers you can like, you know, I'm sure some people go on twitter and they're pissed because they, you know, they can't, nobody that they follow saying anything or write back to them. But it just. So it's such, such a 24 hour chat room source of. Yeah. Well, you don't have to chat with people, you can just read what people are saying and really choose what you want to respond to. The 24 hour aspect is really interesting when you're flying, when you're in like in England or Europe or something like that and times are all screwed up and weird, but you can constantly be tweeting and you know, and you can kind of like, it kind of replaces texting all your friends about what you're doing.

Speaker 5:          02:14:08       You just send a tweet that's not going to wake somebody up like you didn't want to text. So I'm at Buckingham Palace and you know, they're trying to sleep and the phone's going on, you know, it's a good way to like I use it as like a texting device when I think somebody might not be awake, I just write to them a direct message on twitter instead of texting them. Oh do you really? I don't check those enough. Yeah, I know you're really slow to get back on those sometimes for weeks and some people, it's funny, when you write direct messages to people, sometimes they just don't even know that that's a thing that I did that with voicemail. Now I don't ever listen to my voicemails and it's probably the dumbest thing ever, but I just, that's, to me, it's just annoying. I went to one guys, one guy tweeted me, one guy tweeted me, it was like, it's a shame who's fucking phone is on?

Speaker 5:          02:14:54       That was me. That would wake a person up. Yeah, that's brutal. How hard. Why don't you have that bitch on vibrate? He's not used to doing podcasts. One Guy tweeted, one guy tweeted me, um, something that was on vibrate. It wasn't me. It was a fibrate. Shit's broken sun. Yeah, it's, it's, it's got a weird quirk to it because you don't have a case on you drop that bitch. Tell the truth. No, I, it's, I've done pretty good at not dropping it. It's my baby, you know, I don't. Uh, I don't drop it. This guy tweeted me. Um, you know, it's a shame that you can't reply and say something to, for help the troops. It was like really weird, like phonetically all fucked up and it was all caps to see, to support the troops, the explanation point, exclamation point one, one, one. And it was like it was.

Speaker 5:          02:15:43       And then I go, wow, what the fuck did I like? This guy expects me to reply is I have a half a million twitter followers. Dude. Sometimes I don't look at it all day. I don't. There's no way I could respond to everybody. It's impossible. I do. So then I thought you're awesome. Every single person. Absolutely awesome. Right? So then I go to every single person, but quite a few, I go to his twitter page and that's the same message he sent to literally thousands of evil. He just like, Oh yeah, you go look at any time somebody writes, in case you're wondering about their personality or whatever, you can go and see everything else they've written. I love robot. Probably hate it when it's like if it's at Benson, at Joe Rogan, at red band, some some shit. And it's like, well, no, that's what happened. That's what happens is it's fine when it's, my actual friends are

Speaker 8:          02:16:29       thrown in there like we all have common interests, but when somebody just throws in random, you know, like, you know, princess. So it's as well that's just, that's just his ass will now be tweeting you tonight. I guarantee you people are right. Snoop Dogg and Doug Benson, you guys something about pot that they think we both need to know. But when they just throw in, like when it's just to me and Kim Kardashians and Brian Williams from NBC news or whatever, like some weird combination of, you know, on the, on the fringe celebrity, uh, it's, it's such a turnout. It makes you want to just not respond to them. And then you go look at their page and they're just randomly picking names and that's how they do a lot of, uh, there's a lot of spam now on, on twitter. If you, you know, as soon as you get a message us that seems like an ad and then you, then you check their page and they're just, it's just sending that same thing. I'm talking to my podcast.

Speaker 2:          02:17:29       So in the interest of brevity, I got hacked like I, I signed up for, yeah, I must have clicked on some link to get some twitter picture or something like that. And somehow or another they tweeted from my account about some contests for an ipad two and I was following them. All of the sudden I was like, wow, this is amazing. Like they hacked into by twitter account. You apparently it was probably some red tape or some, you know, find print rather. And you know, when you agreed to, uh, accept some, you know, some twitter application.

Speaker 8:          02:18:00       It happens everyday. Not Everyday, but pretty frequently I'll see one of my more famous friends or people had followed just because I'm curious about them, that we still treat something odd or something that sends, seems like an ad. And then the next tweet is like, Oh shit, I got hacked. Do you know, did you see when Ashton Kutcher was tweeting? Oh my gosh, that was particularly about paternal being fired. Yeah, because he did all. He knew all he, all he reacted to, and I'm sure that's what a lot of people reacted to, was just hearing that this amazing coach got fired just very suddenly and he didn't stop to think, wow, that big of a move. Like why would penn state following a fire a guy? So suddenly if something really terrible didn't happen, but he still went on and tweeted, oh man, that's a bummer.

Speaker 8:          02:18:48       Or something like that. Or I love you, Joe Pa. Yeah. Yeah. And then the other guy, but then he did Qa, I guess kind of a good thing to spin it. He respond. He retweeted every person that wrote to them, you're an asshole urine idiot and you just write in each one something like, yeah, I'm sorry I did. I just didn't know all the facts. He sort of responded to a lot of people in show them, showed a lot of the vitriol that was happening. You made a staff at Foxconn responded to. It seemed like something he really did. It was kind of the whole factory of people responding to twitter. Imagine he is always Chinese workers, like the ones they use in world of warcraft

Speaker 5:          02:19:28       to build up your energy, you know, they send your account overseas and some Chinese guy plays with it until he fucking starves to death. Just copying machines, body aside and throw some new student onto the block too. I'm not cynical enough to think that Ashton didn't do it himself because it. Because it all happened in such real time. Right. You just had so many people. Seems to me that when you're a celebrity that's involved in a public scandal, he has this most latest one. It seems interesting that he's tweeting people at all. You know, it's like you wouldn't. You would think if you're gonna, you're gonna read any of the replies. You know you're going to get a lot of people that are going to ask you a bunch of questions and you don't want to answer like, do you really want to just go out there and, and interconnect with people, but I guess he does it.

Speaker 5:          02:20:12       Spill. That's the amazing thing is it's like, you know, how important is it to get, to try to feel like you're getting your side of it out when, when you think you're misunderstood, you know, and, and at a certain point in time, a lot of the people's twitters become a very impersonal, you know, when the numbers get too big, it seems like people take less chances. The they say less than a million people writing back to you that you shouldn't have used a certain slur. Something when you were trying to. The joke was how inappropriate what you were. Right. Like I'll sometimes, if I think it's something really dark, I'll just, I'll just drop it in the middle of the night because a lot of stuff just gets sort of lost in the twitter verse, you know, like nobody's sitting. Most people don't sit and read every single thing written by every single person.

Speaker 5:          02:20:57       They follow that because a lot of people follow a thousand people. So you're just in this kind of rushing stream of comments and sometimes they'll land on you because they know they like you more than other people they follow or whatever. But sometimes they'll also like anything that looks like you're just promoting a Gig, they might just breeze past it. I get every time I play a town, like the day after on twitter, someone will write me, when are you coming to? And it's that town I was just in and it just been tweeting about. But it's just, you can't expect everybody to see everything. It's hard to. I mean, think that you're going to communicate. I mean you, you got to hope that your twitter is interesting enough that people are going to lock onto it, you know, and you're going to hope that you build some sort of a community there and then they're going to be able to follow you on your website or follow you at your shows or look through your tweets to find out where you're at or you know, do you have a little schedule on your twitter page?

Speaker 5:          02:21:50       So if you go to your twitter page, you can see what the upcoming dates are. They have a link to a site where I've got all my dates, but that, what do you guys think about this new business they have on there with all the, um, you know, activity following activity following. Oh, clicked on that. Yet there's a word activity now in the top of your page and if you click on it, you see just a list of everything that everybody, you follow what they're up to, like, who they've retreated, who they're following, much information tells you, it tells you. You get to find out now as soon as somebody follows you, do you do that? Because that's kind of interesting because then because then you can, if you're just sitting there looking at it and it comes up that somebody just started following you, it's kind of cool to just immediately send them some sort of, hey, welcome, hope you hope you like it.

Speaker 5:          02:22:37       Kind of message from my peer specialists got big tits. Dude, tell me what you do, how do you work and how do you work with Doug Benson? It's 2:00 in the morning, 11 in the morning. Okay, here's the scenario. You're alone stone to the gills. Okay. And you just like checking out twitter and some really ridiculously hot suicide girl with tattoos just starts following you. I, you know, I might write back and say, you know, hey, what's up? Or what's up? Hello? Or whatever. Just what you do, just reach, reach, reach out, somebody to see what happens to a little high, just little, hey, what's up? Nothing incriminating button creeping. And then often what we'll come back is I can't direct message you because you don't follow me. And my next direct message says the system works and then you know, and then you, you see how different people handle it.

Speaker 5:          02:23:28       Different ways. Some people will get pissed off right away and don't want to, you know, don't want to deal with somebody where they're half of the conversation is public, but your half is, is private. But you know, what else am I going to do? You know, I, I'm not on twitter to have conversations with other people in front of all, all of my followers because. So why don't you just fucking with them, it's not interesting to read. Just follow them for a little while and then unfold. You can do that for 20 number, but no. Then I really will play a game where if there's somebody that I want to follow, I will add them and then go through the list and see who's going to go. It's usually somebody that I followed that just ultimately is their tweets. Haven't been that interesting because they're like, you know, I, I followed some crazy super famous people just because I, I think it could be interesting and some I cling to like I, I love following Alec Baldwin.

Speaker 5:          02:24:19       I think he's really entertaining and yeah, and I don't follow them out. But I gave up my, her, I followed her for a while and then stop. I stopped a long time ago. Why? Because he just tweets a lot and for awhile there it was just a lot of back and forth with Demi Moore and that was just kinda like they were being way too cute. Like the whole time you're like, this relationship is not going to last. They're putting way too much effort into pretending, not pretending, maybe actually being in love with each other, but they just won't shut up about it. How can you maintain that is a couple PDA on twitter's growth. What if she's a lesbian and he's like her beard? Ooh, no, I think they probably fucked. They had turned sex where? Like the creepy weird. Sorry. I came in and looked ashen, his asshole and stuff like that. Brian, you just ruined everything. It ruined everything. I know he's mad at Ashton now. Ashton supposedly having affairs. Oh, so now they don't talk. Uncle Bruce is going to kick them out. But that's the funny thing that he's, you know, for TV viewers instantly forgive the whole thing about him having affairs, but you know,

Speaker 4:          02:25:24       that show the ratings might have come down a little bit from the jumping out in favor of Joe Papa. Really at the wrong moment, you know, because you know, that's what's amazing to me about the whole Penn state story is just that. That is, that is, you know, only one notch above the worst thing. The worst thing a person could do probably right there, you know, and I don't even want to think about what's below it and, and you know, and so everyone's disgusted by it, but some are still managed to be some people that, that are just, you know, defending in some weird way, you know, the people that were involved in the story. Yeah. You can't, you know, I was saying how weird it is. The guy's name was officer or Macquarie, the guy who, uh, found them in, in the hotel room together, which did, that whole thing now is just falling apart.

Speaker 4:          02:26:13       His story's not matching what, what supposedly happened at the time. And which guy? Macquarie. Yeah. He's saying now that he went, he did go to police officers and then they and they proceeded to, you know, not follow through because initially he's just sick of getting all this shit about people saying that he just went to Joe Pa and he didn't go to the cops. So he now he's saying he did, but he testified, you know, because this guy has gone through, you know, people had to testify for and against San Dusky before on it earlier charges, this is crazy. And so at that time it supposedly the report was that he didn't speak to any cops and now he's saying he did. So it's, it's, it's one of those complicated, horrifying stories that we may never end in our lifetimes. It may just go on and on and on, just because getting to the bottom of everything that happened.

Speaker 4:          02:27:08       Like I heard someone tell someone else the theory that then I heard that is just absolutely mortifying that, you know, this guy saying Dusky worked with the children's charity and those were the kids he was bringing to the Games and that they show pictures of him like leaning on these kids and they got little foothill football helmets on and, and you know, it's crazy that he was showering with them at all, like the kids and the end him. Neither one of them are playing in a game. So why do they even need. Why? What's the pretense for being in the showers? Yeah, like right there, the guy's guilty. Could he be, you know, like I don't care if you put. If he actually had sex with him, he's just setting up that scenario, makes them a creep that shouldn't be allowed to do that. And with kids with these disinfect, these kids that are poor and you know, and from foster homes or whatever the, you know, this, this charity, he's, he's got these extra vulnerable kids and he's doing these things too and it's probably being taken to a football game. It's the most amazing thing that's ever happened to them. And they also don't necessarily understand the implications of what he's doing to them when he physically attacks them or those photos real of his house. Like being in the same like, like the backyard of an elementary school. Just seen

Speaker 5:          02:28:22       that I bought surprise. I mean it just like an elementary school and a little bit of woods and then a house and then supposedly, I don't know if it was just a joke, but supposedly that's his house. Like on the other side of this little woods, I'm thinking like that woods is probably like that scene in like human centipede word. Like they go and find this house in the middle of the other side of the woods and there's like a creepy guy that lives in there and molests kids I come to, you know, you probably like sneaks through the forest and spies on kids at the elementary school and it's just like this creepy rape force. We all just start talking and just go. It's hilarious when you're fucking high and just start talking about something because I never even got to my point which was, which was that, you know, there's a lot of rich people that also pumped money into this charity because this guy told them to.

Speaker 5:          02:29:07       And so this one law enforcement officer who I think probably has a good idea about these things, suggested the notion that this guy was grooming kids for boosters to fool around with. Oh my God. Like there was a whole ring. He had a whole. Yeah. Like he had like, he had a whole system like that. That's a, that's a possibility. Oh my God, like this thing is going to get so twisted and deep as used. Horrifying. It's amazing that he got away with it as long as he did and the only way he got away with it for 19 years, 20 years, whatever the fuck it was, is if people knew and didn't say anything, period. It was the institution. It was the everyone afraid of losing their jobs, losing the game, losing their, you know, their, you know, everything is so important to them.

Speaker 5:          02:29:52       I mean they rioted when he got fired, you saw the riots, right? What I'm saying, they were Ashton Kutcher, Ashton Kutcher would've flipped a car over if he was there because the story just got quickly, more and more horrifying, but they just reacted immediately that he was fired. Yeah. Well, as soon as he was like, well also how horrible for him to come out and say, this is horrible. I'm going to finish out the season and then retire. Like his first move should have been. I'm Outta here. Like I went to retire and I fucked up, but saying I'm going to finish out the season. That gave everyone like this hope that like they were going to have a great championship season and then worry about this later, and so then when they turned around and really, you know, he ended up being fired or resigned or whatever, however went down, that's when they started flipping shit over.

Speaker 5:          02:30:40       This story was in a book. It would be two. Fantastic. It'd be like, this is too crazy. This is not like a Stephen King Book. Yeah, you wouldn't. Yeah, it is. Really. It really is. Really is. You would think there's no way that can happen for this long. There's no way I could go on for 20 years and he could just keep getting away with it and keep mining these children to have such shame and confusion by the incident that they never tell anyone. How many guys, how many kids? Always kids. It's also kids like most of this stuff happens with kids that are familiar with. They're the person that attacks them. It's never. It's rarely an abject stranger who gets in their life and quickly done something horrible. We actually spent a good deal of time

Speaker 2:          02:31:19       talking about this in the podcast last night. About how, or last time about how um, there were some emails back and forth from some priests were they actually talked about getting boys from troubled homes, getting boys who don't have good connections to their family. They don't have anyone to count on. Get them. They go after them and grown them. Some dark shit, man.

Speaker 5:          02:31:43       Yeah. So this is Sanduski guy's just, it's just not a very, like we were making fun of earlier his, his side of the story, talking to Bob Costas, particularly scary. Bob Cast is so good at those interviews too. And I said, why were you in this? Why did you need to shower at all? Yeah, that's a good question. Asking that. That's a good question. Well, I think everybody, but he did press him pretty hard. You did. I think everybody assumes that guy fucks kids. I think everybody's assuming that, but they have to be careful in how they proceed with questioning him, I think. But the thing that he did that he did this tea, this radio interview to spin the court of public opinion, that's ridiculous, you know, but I think it just made it worse. I'll way, way, way, way worse, way worse because he was.

Speaker 5:          02:32:29       Because he went into it with the Hubris in the confidence of thinking that as long as I just go in there and denied, at least some people might believe me. Yes. But then saying just being such a creep and saying like being around children now the answer is no. I would never do that to a child. That's the answer. It's in their parents that are going to try to murder him. Now I'm. Oh yeah, no, that's the thing that I think not only is the media outside his house now, I think that like that's another crazy thing letting him go on bales. Ridiculous. Like, I mean certainly in jail, I don't think they cheat child predators very well. They to isolate doctors, isolate them in a jail, like letting him go on bail. I don't, I don't get that at all. I think that guy's going to ice himself.

Speaker 5:          02:33:11       He might ice himself or get out of the access to kids in showers have to be limited at least to a couple of hours a week or something like that says you can't do it daily because that's what happened to him the first time where I was. They took away as key to the showers. What they took away. It's got such a school did because the first time it happened, they believed him. When he said he was, it was just horseplay. There was no, so it was hot and he had to only do hot dog hot tubs after that. Oh my God. Yeah. Where's it defined? A new venue. It takes them to hotel rooms. That's what it does. Who brought kids with them on the road there were staying with them. That's. It's such an amazing. Such an amazing cover. Like I always. I always joke around on stage about how wouldn't it be funny if I did all I've done to create this idea that I'm a pod comic and it turns out I am a cop and that all my shows, everybody gets arrested like a giant sting operation.

Speaker 2:          02:34:08       Other people in the pot movement it probably undercover cops you think? Yeah, there was one that died in a motorcycle accident and he would uh, meet at this. It was like a normal chapter.

Speaker 5:          02:34:18       One of those groups, you know, and uh, he was uh, a local guy and he was in this, this group and I died in a motorcycle accident. It turned out he was a cop and he was undercover the entire time or maybe just enjoying himself. I don't think so. I think that was his job. I think that's what it came to. Kids that don't smoke course, which is an interesting. Like those people are like saints to me. Like why go to all this trouble or something that you're not doing, but they see the big picture. Yeah. It's a freedom issue. The main issue is why would anybody be able to tell you what you can't do and someone telling you that you can't get high is absolutely nuts. It's crazy. It's like if you were. I always say if you're on an island with two people and one person said, listen man, I don't want you getting high.

Speaker 5:          02:35:00       You get high, I'm going to put you in a cage. He'd be like, I'm going to have to kill this guy going to lock me in a fucking cage if I get high. That's ridiculous. Tell that I want to do. Like if they said you can't, you know you can't have sex with a cantaloupe, and if there was four people, and I mean it's just as ridiculous. If there's a 4 million people, it's just as ridiculous. It's ridiculous for one person to tell you what you can and can't do with your bond and it's not gonna affect other people. It's not an issue where you're ruining the fucking environment. It's not an issue with her. You're damaging the civilization. You're not doing anything while you're doing it wrong, then you're doing it wrong. For sure. Where? Where are you at this weekend and you're going to do the Sunday show at the center of your shows are sold out already, right?

Speaker 5:          02:35:40       Yeah, they're sold out. I got one. I got one show at four, 20 in the afternoon on Sunday. San Jose is ridiculous. You are sticking to a meme. You to that motherfucker. Do you like it so much? Well, you know, you gotta play clubs where they don't have a lot of windows, you know, so it still looks like a nightclub or whatever. You've still got the same vibe, but I've had really good time because, you know, I'm, I'm done for the night, I'm off for the rest of the night at 6:00 PM when I do that is cool and I get to actually go out and enjoy these cities that I visit all the time and never see because I'm in the stupid comedy club all night. Not to say that that's not also a great way to just do my living days. But uh, Saturdays and Sundays I'll and some cities I'll come in and they'll do both days.

Speaker 5:          02:36:26       You know, like I got coming up at the Sacramento punchline, Martin Luther King weekend. I'm going to do a show on four slash Saturday slash Sunday for 20 Monday and just hang out there all weekend, have my nights free. There's a lot of likeminded people in Sacramento. She says I am. Yeah, I see what you're saying. It's a fun place. So that's a really smart thing to do, man. So you, you sort of reorganized the weekend, you'd take a spot where it wasn't ordinarily open, you open it for you and you can do it in comedy clubs. They see people that show up are the ones that I told about the show through my podcast or through twitter. And so the crowds are great. We play a game, we play that game that I play on the podcast. I'll let her Balton game. We played that with audience members in my opening act and it's a, it's a blast.

Speaker 5:          02:37:07       Oh really? That's how people from the audience come up and, and, and you know, challenge to whoever I brought with me on the road for that particular and it's super fun and they're awake for four, 20 in the afternoon except in Denver. Both Times I did it in Denver. Somebody managed to get drunk, but everywhere else they're sober. They're not, you know, they may be a few beers in or whatever, but like they're not that, that kind of trash that you see when you do shows at night, especially in a town where there was some sports thing in the afternoon and they'd been drinking since then. They come to your show and there were, you know, they're pre drunk before they even start drinking their two drink minimum. So is that how you're doing all your shows now? You're doing all? Not all of them. I also do like, I'll go into a club and just be there on a night.

Speaker 5:          02:37:52       They're normally closed Sunday, Monday or Tuesday, like I'm doing the, um, Fort Lauderdale Improv on Monday, December 11th, and the West Palm Improv on Tuesday, December twelfth. And they're both huge clubs. They're really nice, but they're huge. So every time I play there, you know, normally if I have to do two or three shows, I'm just not gonna to every show is going to have a lot of empty seats. But if I just go in and do one on a night when they're not even normally open and hopefully everybody that's, you know, into me and has the night available. Come check it out. Yeah. That improv is gigantic. I think it's 600 plus seats, right? Isn't it? It's a palace. You know? That's a big goddamn place. Now when you think about how many shows you're doing two shows on a Friday night and 600 seats. Holy Shit Man. That's a. that's a good day here.

Speaker 5:          02:38:43       Show. That's a theater show. It's hard to get that many people to come to her and it's like, oh, you're dying. What? Your Voice. Because that's the new impression. This is a, this is mafia Doug Benson data. Come on the watering a podcast pretty much over. What do you think? You know, since I can't talk anymore, is that really your voice now? For like a minute or two? I just like know you're serious. Wow. Yeah. Because I was on one of those tirades where we want something to drink and take a breath. Do you want a water or something? I got a water. Okay. You're okay. Damn. I never seen anybody before fall apart. I mean you're okay. I not read about it. I'm falling apart.

Speaker 5:          02:39:32       Just vocally fall apart. I'm trying to pull it back faster than I normally would. But. So when did you start doing this? You don't do any weekends anymore. You don't do like a regular weekend and the club? Uh, some every once in a while, but for the most part the smaller club that I, you don't do that. I really like. You don't do midnight Saturday shows do you, do you ever do. That's ridiculous. Three shows in one night. That's the other thing I like about doing the four slash 20 shows or, or even 8:00, but it's the only show I love doing one show. Like comics would like to go from club to club to club, you know, like to do that. Will you have a, you, you like to like you have a big chunk. You do what will you do? Like an hour or so what do you do?

Speaker 5:          02:40:15       Like I do 45 a standup and then an extra 15 or 20 of, you know, playing the game and fucking around with the crowd and that's pretty much all people want to see. And then you're done. You feel like you did it. You don't want to Redo it. Yeah. It's weird. It's weird, you know, it's not a movie where they just started up again and it's the same thing again. Well, the real problem with second shows that sometimes I'll be in the middle of the second show when I'll go, did I do this? But yet, because I can't remember because I've gone through a whole show and now I'm in the second show. Again, when you're on stage, you're pretty much in this zone and I'm in the zone and I'm like, I'm in the zone. I've been his own for a long time, but did I know I did that?

Speaker 5:          02:40:53       Did I do that earlier? I don't. I don't know if I did that joke. Holy Shit. And then you panic. You're like, was that the first show or is it the second show? Should I try this? And then you go into it and you're like, oh my God. And you kind of have your bits tend to be, you know, on the, on the longer end, like they don't really, you don't really bring up things that are super brief. So much of a case if it's a really short joke, right. Gets a big laugh when I say it again, because it was like, yeah, he's, he said it again. You don't ever play up the fact that you're, hi. I heard about people doing like fake shots. I'm like, man, I can't be fake shots. That's terrible. No, but yeah, if the intention is to like, hey everybody, I'm doing a shot.

Speaker 5:          02:41:33       But if I tell the staff, send me up fake shots. If people offer to buy me one really because I don't. I hate it. You can't say no when a shot comes up to you, unless you're like a. If you go, I'm an alcoholic or something. If you go, I'm, I'm, I'm six years sober. I'm not going to do it. But with my act and the fact that I've already got a cocktail up there, they'll send me up shots and you know, sometimes I'll do them and I'm fine with it. But a lot of reserves the right to drink fake shots. Yeah. Well, and you know, it's just, it just gets it over with. If you just drank a fake show telling everybody. Yeah, I'll never do it again. Yeah. People are going to know now now the secrets on your game son. But once you know what I mean, you, if you do the shot quickly, it's over with.

Speaker 5:          02:42:11       But if you stand there and act like you're not going to do it, then people started chanting worse wouldn't be out of it. Now. All the people that went to shows before going to think back at the times, you threw a shot back and screamed yeehaw and jumped up and they don't act like God damn. I don't act it too, too big. I just, I just pretend to drink it because even when I normally drink Assad, I usually don't make a lot of noise on top of the glass and it's just a glass of water and I do a whole song and dance numbers. The glass against the wall fucking guts or is it on his tip? All that and we find out you were just stone cold, sober drinking water, putting on a show. Fuck. I'd have to say that I, it's probably happened maybe four times in entire career.

Speaker 5:          02:43:00       I've never dressed. The combination of me saying to the staff send me up a fake shot combined with somebody wanting to send me up a shot because it doesn't happen every show because I'm not. So what happens to the money laundering going on here where it was a fake shot is not worth anything. They're charging someone for a shy. Well, regular shots barely worth the price of a. It doesn't seem like there's money that's unaccounted for there. Yeah. Yeah. Money Laundering, I think that Shit's illegal. Well, let me tell you how I balanced it out in my, uh, the rest of my years as a comic is when people, when I'm at the bar and a comedy club and somebody offers to buy me a drink, I always turn it down and say I get the club gives me free drinks and I don't want you to buy one.

Speaker 5:          02:43:42       And then a lot of times they go, I want to buy you one anyway. Like it becomes important to do something for you, which I appreciate the bat, but it's frustrating to have, you know, that kind of argument with somebody, you know, like, don't spend your money, you don't spend your money. So people that have, you know, I don't know, they have a chance to meet you for the first time. It's important to them. I understood I was still standing right there and talk to them. I don't say I don't want you to drink and run away if they want to give you something, you know, it's a gesture that's why never turned down. We'd. When people give me, we'd really, you trust it all. You don't ever think, man, I could be smart to have this conversation before you're. You're on the more paranoid interest the whole week thing that I am.

Speaker 5:          02:44:22       I've never looked at him like, oh my God, I'm not taking that. That looks like. Yeah, I just think it's such a. it's such a crap shoot. I mean, let's say I probably smoked from strangers, either a bud they gave me or some sort of joint. It must be in the thousands at this point. Wow. So nothing's happened yet. So the odds seem incredibly good that I'll get through a few more years of it do. I'm so happy for you. I'm glad. I'm glad you pulled through it. Mti. It's dangerous. That's great. Do you ever worry about what's dangerous provocateurs? Perhaps comps posing as donors want to get high with you, go to their current of trouble because the voice of the movement people craziest when Willie Nelson's tour bus, that seems like it's really. And get them for pot. Come on, come on, find something else or just leave him alone, but he's in trouble for that.

Speaker 5:          02:45:17       You know, they were letting him off the hook, but then, uh, they, they, you know, someone get offended that the fact that he, uh, is above the law, above the wall. Yeah. So some idiot kind of fed into the whole thing. This Texas man, you don't understand texts as well. A lot of places. I don't understand that. Texas is a real tricky one. There's some big cities and then there's some fucking people that live in a time warp. You know, there's, you've got Dallas, you got Houston, you've got Austin, you've got San Jose, San Antonio, you know, you got, you got some cool cities and then on top of that you've got these weird spots in between the cities that go on forever and ever. And they're massive. There's so much room in Texas, man. It's a country, you know, it really is, is a giant ass fucking state. But boy do I love that Austin though. Oh, that's the best that, that's one of my favorite cities of all time. Anywhere full time. And that's where I'm going to cap city club. You played there. Oh yeah. I love that. I'm going to do,

Speaker 8:          02:46:10       I'm not only might doing for 20 shows, I'm combining my other thing that I love to do now, which is podcasts and I add 4:20 on thanksgiving weekend on Saturday and Sunday I'm doing a two different tapings of my podcast that I'll then be able to cap city got will. Then be able to turn around and put out on the Internet because that's the only thing I don't. I don't like about stand. I love about stand up comedy. The fact that it's just you and the audience and no one else hears it, but thanks to podcasting, I'm feeling I want to get more stuff out to people right now. So this is a great opportunity for me to show up in a town and instead of doing standup, I do the podcast. So you're saying that you can't put your standing up on the Internet?

Speaker 8:          02:46:52       Well you can't. You know how I am going to do a thing coming up soon. I think my next album is going to be two discs. One is me, like I'll wake up the day of the shows and I won't smoke pot all day, maybe even stopped the day before or something and just be crazy, super sober for the first recording and then between the first show, the second show, smoke as much weed and do as much as I can and then try to do the exact same set again, try to do the album again and then people can listen to both and see the good and the bad news. Your conclusion one into. Yeah, and was like Doug Benson banked and unbanked or stoned and unstained or something like that. But the illusion was it 2002. Two versions of it are two different Algos. Two completely different animals. So Brian was just having fun.

Speaker 8:          02:47:50       He's a silly boy. Yeah, he just says things this motherfucker. So you'll sell a one or the other? Is that we won both. You're buying double album. You bought them both. Okay. And I also dream of a day where I can do a tour where like, you know, how a pearl jam sold like every night of the tour on, on the CD that one time and, and bootlegs obviously happened to everybody all the time and I'd like to make my own bootleg and just make like do a tour of 10 cities and the same act essentially that whatever I'm doing at that time and then a recorded in each place and you can buy, you can buy more than one if you want to see the differences or you can just buy the one from the city or from, from a city you think will be funny to hear me interacting with people of that city.

Speaker 8:          02:48:37       That's a funny idea. And have a bunch of different recordings to choose from. Um, some comics used to sell recordings of the show that you just went to. Yeah. So like cds at a club or two has tried to kind of toy with that sort of idea. A lot of Goddamn cds. But it also doesn't, it only appeals to the drunkest audience members yelled out the dumbest Shit, you know, it's kind of a weird thing to say here by what you just what just happened. But that's what I'm doing with podcasts. Like I do podcasts where people were there live and then they listen to it later. It's like their email address and you go here, I'm going to send you a link to where you can buy this for five bucks. You have your podcast setup where some of them are free, some of them aren't weekly free one of one week.

Speaker 8:          02:49:21       There's bonus free ones that I do like where I record, like if I'm in a rental car with another comic, I'll just record an episode of the show while we're driving. And so I put those up pretty frequently and then like once or twice a month, usually once a month I'll have a episode that's $2 in the comedy album section of Itunes, which is a fun place to be and to be that cheap because like right now one of mine is like number one because it's only $2. And then all the album or the album is behind it costs like eight bucks. So you get a nice, cool, nice placement for a little while and then it falls pretty fast because, you know, people will buy it later, but most people buy it right away or you know, shortly after it goes, becomes available and it's, you know, the money.

Speaker 8:          02:50:07       So you off air, how much the money as well, you know, it's, I don't know if it's, it's just a different route. Gang signs at me, it's a different route that I've gone instead of, uh, instead of having actual advertisers not against having advertisers, I just have already gathered, found the right match. Yeah. People just kept the ones that every other podcast has. And I did those for awhile and I just felt like if I listen to a bunch of podcasts, if I had to always hear about audible books, every podcast I listened to about one 800 flowers. Doug, I never did that one. But yeah, I are Adam and eve or whatever. I wouldn't want to hear about the same thing all over the place. I think each show should have its own thing. Unfortunately for me, movie studios can't really support me because I trashed movies and I can't get like a movie theater chain to support me because people go see movies at the theater near their house.

Speaker 8:          02:50:58       Do you ever feel like confined by the theme of your podcast? The movie thing? Yeah. Well I would, if I were you and you know, like your, your interest in and the amount of movies you see is so far fewer than than what I do, so like I could see where that could be limiting. If you just feel like a movie, why would you choose that? You know what I mean? Just you. If you weren't a comic and you were in, you were in, you worked in UFC like you do, would you, would you think you'd be able to find ongoing satisfaction just talking about UFC as a podcast? Sure, definitely. Yeah, so that's, that's how much I love movies. It's just that I could just, I could talk on and on and on, but if I just said, dude, just a UFC podcast every week, I'd feel a little defined by it or you would because you've got so many other areas that you're interested in, but I'm saying like somebody who's just really, that's their main focus, like because for me, growing up, my main focus was just movies.

Speaker 8:          02:51:50       Like I wanted to watch them and be in them and that's all I cared about. Do you do, do you write scripts for the two? Of course. Uh, yeah, a little bit, but I've, you know, I've grown really, I, that's the good and bad of podcasting is it's allowed to talk about and participate in what I want to do without ever having to sit by myself and write, you know, like the process of just sitting and writing something while the outcome is very satisfying. Like right now I'm working on a book and it's, you know, it's torture for me to sit down and write a chapter of my book. Why? Because they're just sitting there by myself. Writing is just not, it's no fun to me. I want to always have, you know, a TV on or listening to something or watching something going, you know, going out and doing something.

Speaker 8:          02:52:40       Go to starbucks. What is that exactly? Is that. Those guys are, that's what they are. It's like I do enjoy sometimes sitting in a whole foods or something and getting work done on my computer because it's fun to have all that weird stimuli around you, but you can still just kinda look at your, what you're doing. Well, just look up whenever. Anything interesting because your ideas too when you're looking around. Like if you have your twitter handy, it's like you know, you see something stupid ass. Especially when you're paying bills. Yeah. We gotta wrap this picture but that's the thing I do like thank God I do have the marijuana, not God, but you know what I mean. Jesus. Yes. Thank Jesus. I have to have marijuana because that does help to make writing less boring and frustrated.
