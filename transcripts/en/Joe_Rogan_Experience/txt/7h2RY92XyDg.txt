Speaker 1:          00:01          Hello Freak bitches. There's nothing reason to going on right here. There's no reasonable consideration of the pros and cons of this issue. And no one's, there's no one's stepping in the middle, right?

Speaker 2:          00:15          It's like the FBI and apple dispute. That's what it's like. It's the same thing. You got it all on one side. You've got all on the other. And the reality is, you know what, we could have found a solution here somewhere if, uh, you know, if, if, if we'd been added on, I, although who knows, I don't know. Apple seems to be inclined to draw a line under this protection

Speaker 1:          00:35          killer issue. Issue is they're trying to get into that guy's phone. The killer who killed those people in San Bernandino. They want to get into his phone and uh, the FBI wants apple to engineer some sort of a back door.

Speaker 2:          00:48          Well, here's, here's what it is. So this guy, uh, side for had, he had, uh, three phones, at least that we know about, two of them, he destroyed. He completely destroyed him. And, and the, the, the bureau's been looking, they did nothing recoverable off those systems. And they've asked a lot of people for assistance. So they had the other phone, which was in his truck, which is his work phone. It was belonged to the county. And so they went to the county bureau, did they went to the county when they pulled his phone out of the truck and they said, we need to get the information off of this thing because you know what, a phone, a phone nowadays everybody keeps everything on their phone. Right. And so they uh, they got the support they pulled and they found out that he had shut off the function that a uploads data to the cloud, uh, in October.

Speaker 2:          01:31          And so they were able to get everything up to October, but then that's two full months prior to the attack. So they said, okay, well we can't get this and that. And the, the, the phone has, you know, this default position where if you try the password 10 times in a racist, everything. So they took the phone, the bureau took the f, the phone to apple and this was well before they had to go and get a court order. Well before it became public knowledge, they actually went and had numerous quiet conversations with apple and they went to apple and they said, literally set, you can take the phone, keep it on your campus, keep it in your facility, put it, no, we don't. You know, wherever put in your lab, all we're asking is for you to create a systems information file that you can force on that phone, that one phone and pull the tech, which then allows you to brute force the password, right?

Speaker 2:          02:18          And get the texts off of there, get the data off of there and exists. And then you can destroy the sif, the systems information file. You can keep the phone, we don't even need to touch it. We, you know, whatever you just give us the shit that's on the phone. An apple has, has been helpful in the past. They've been, they've been helpful in the past and this time for some, for whatever motivation they've decided to draw a line in the sand and say, no, we're not going to do this. And it's not as if they haven't been helpful. And there's an ongoing dialogue. And so it's, it's disingenuous to say that apple is now, you know, uh, the bulwark for privacy because they have been in the past and they will continue to be helpful, I suppose in their own way. But for this particular phone, for this one time where they could have held onto the phone, created that Sif destroyed the sif at, at that moment that they've pulled the texts officer, that's it.

Speaker 2:          03:11          That's done. So now what Tim Cook is saying is not that it's creating a backdoor. He's not saying that he's saying it creates a precedent, but the precedent was already that if the bureau goes through the, the, the process the congress has set and then goes through that process and gets a court order and the court, then it looks at it and says, yes, you've got probable cause you've got reasonable concern here. Uh, they provide a court order, then they go and they make this request for assistance. They're also talking about a dead guy talking about a guy who shot 14 paper was killed, 14 people. Um, I've heard all sorts of things. I've heard people say to me, and I, and again, I understand, don't get me wrong, because I understand fully the importance of finding the right place on the pendulum for Security and privacy.

Speaker 2:          03:58          I get that. I get that. And that's an important discussion. I'm not saying it's not, it's, you should always have that conversation, but part of that is then during the course of that conversation, Congress, the courts, they make those decisions. Where does that pendulum, you know, settle between security and privacy? And that settles here. Okay, fine. Then that's what the bureau or whomever has to go through to get approval to get some assistance. And that's where it stands. But you know, to say that because now you've got all three branches of government have said, yeah, we think that really we could use this information off of this phone. But I've heard everybody say, well, why don't they just do the rest of the investigation? Well, of course they fucking done the rest of the investigation. They don't all the other investigative steps. So what are you're saying in a situation like this?

Speaker 2:          04:42          Uh, you just want them to do 80% of the investigation. And if you've got, you know, that you've got material on here who, which may lead to operational activity, uh, in, in finding other people who were involved or finding people overseas who were in somehow assisting or whatever it may be. If you're saying, well, just know, you know what, for the sake of this, we're not asking for a back door. They're asking for that. So that, that one phone, and that's where this whole thing is really headed south and it's become this idea that, you know, which is erroneous. But I understand what Tim Cook is saying about the precedent, although not really, because again, they've done this before. For some reason for this one, they're drawing a line. So anyway, I, but I've heard that, why don't they just do the rest of the investigation and skip this part?

Speaker 2:          05:26          What I don't, I don't, I don't follow that logic train. And then the other people, other people were saying, well, why don't they just get it off the metadata? And that's another one of those things where people never believed what the government was saying, but the metal fucking data was numbers and volume. That was it. There was no information to be had there. You could sit in a fucking room full of metadata and not know what the hell you're looking at. You had to go through the court process to then get that particular numbers, uh, information.

Speaker 1:          05:49          So here's my question, because this is what came up with the Edward Snowden thing. They were saying that the government is monitoring all cell phone data constantly and they can get information all the time. Well, this kind of proves that not to be true. Yeah. But people don't look at it that way. They don't, they don't, they don't make that leap back and say, oh, well maybe that was a fallacy. Yeah, sure. The metadata was sweeping up all that, that those numbers and volume. But again, it's not enough to what end. Yeah. And so some people would say, once they realize what it was actually doing, then they say, wow, but that's so what? So they're just collecting this shit in the basement. It's not doing any good. So they shouldn't even collect that information. So what Edward Snowden was talking about is essentially just when it pertains to email, I mean, he said they're collecting all this information that the NSA is collecting all this information in regards to cell phone data, the recording, every phone call, the recording, all these text messages.

Speaker 1:          06:42          Yeah. Um, so is that not true? Well, no, I frankly, I'm here. Of course nobody's going to, again, this is a very emotive, right? So there's all these people out there, they're going to say, fuck you. You don't know what the fuck are you talking about? Yeah, no, there is nobody right now unless you're a terrorist, a terrorist suspect or a criminal. This, nobody in the government hooks up fuck about you. I'm here to tell you your Dick pics or safe ladies and Gentlemen, Dick Pics are absolutely safe. Jina pictures that you've been floating around telling your boyfriend or, okay girls, it's secure. Nobody's going to route those around that. And are you out for those as a piece of shit and UNAMERICAN in the first place? Yeah. So that's a, that's a really eyeopening thing though because this case kind of throws that all into jeopardy cause everybody was like concerned. Like, Hey, the government can check in on all your phone calls and all your text messages. Well this would clearly be a case where they would want to do that so that they don't, if they can't do it here without the, did the judge granting this order and what, so tell me why did, there was a recent court order there ruled in favor of apple.

Speaker 2:          07:44          They did. And that was in New York and that was an interesting case as well. And that's probably going to set a precedent for maybe, maybe we'll see cause it's a little bit different what the judge essentially was saying in that case and it involved, uh, uh, uh, uh, narco trafficking investigation that was going on. And by the way, this isn't just for terrorism. Imagine what if this was for Pete Ophelia, I mean, I imagine a large Pete Ophelia ring. What are you going to say? No, we don't want to catch those fucking Douche bags that are involved in that because privacy, you know, I understand the privacy aspect, but each case has to be looked at on its merits. And if you say through the courts and through the, through the congress that these are the hoops that the bureau has to jump through and they jumped through those hoops, then then what?

Speaker 2:          08:27          Then it's up to each company to decide where they want to support it or not. I don't know that, that seems strange. But anyway, the point being is that the one in New York, the judge essentially was saying, well look, you want us, you want the courts to make a decision on this for something that Congress should really make a decision on this. And so he, in a way, his decision was a pushback against the concept of the, that the, uh, the bureau was basing this on, which is a very old law. And so the judge is saying, look, you're relying on a law that's a couple of hundred years old or whatever. Um, maybe instead we should be having this looked at it through the legislature. And so there was a, there was an interesting sort of legality to his, his response to this, but it, it definitely, uh, favorite apple and, and, and and sure.

Speaker 2:          09:07          That's great. Let's legislate it. But do you think that just maybe, um, there are times when from an operational perspective, you might want to move a little bit quicker than asking Congress to take up, uh, an issue and debate it and then maybe eventually come up. So maybe occasionally you're going to have moments like this, the San Bernardino shooting where you've got a phone in your hand and all you're asking apple to do is take possession of it. And who knows? Maybe their problem is they're worried that if they create the sif at that moment, someone's going to steal it from them. I met one of their employees, so maybe they got an internal security issue because then they can destroy it. The bureau is not asking for that phone back. They're not asking for that Sif. They're not asking them for to do it on any other, what is this?

Speaker 2:          09:49          Sif is a systems information file. Okay. So you just force it onto that phone and that bypasses the capacity. Essentially what the court has done is made a very conservative, conservative interpretation of the law. Right. And basically saying that this needs to be, this is a place with the courts should be deciding, we believe you should be taking this to Congress. And so therefore I don't see why you're legislating or asking us to make a decision on this. You see, I understand the common person's perspective. They don't trust the government, the whole Edward Snowden leaks thing. Everybody's freaking out about that. And then they look at this saying, well, this is the slippery slope. Again, this is the thing that if the government has access to your phone, like we're talking about a fucking mass murderer and a guy who's already dead and we have one phone.

Speaker 2:          10:35          Yeah, yeah. It's, and, and, and so to say that you're going to only do a limited investigation, even though you know you've got potential information, right? And your way to do it, like on an individual basis, just one phone only. That's what they're asking for. That's what they're asking. But can it be that you could never grant ag? I mean it's, it's, it doesn't make any sense to me. Well, you wouldn't want to get access to that guy's fucking data. And here's where I think going back to that overriding theme, which is nothing resides in the center anymore. You're right. We do have to be concerned about privacy. And I agree. Okay, what happens if you don't? Big Brother. But there are times when, you know, operational concerns probably override a, at least an element of this where you have common pr or a reason to, people can exist in the comment in the middle and say, yeah, on this occasion, because you've gone through all these, these orders and because we've set up this protection now, meaning, you know, apple holds onto it and have it, but you know, it, that's not the way it works.

Speaker 2:          11:30          And so therefore apple comes out and says there, and then the misinformation, ah, they're trying to create a backdoor to our apple devices. By the way, what do you think apple does with their devices that they sell in China? Do you think the Chinese government would allow apple if someone's got to talk about this in the media, do you think the Chinese government would allow apple to sell devices that they can't get into? I, uh, we could ask.

Speaker 3:          12:01          Okay.
