Speaker 1:          00:00:05       We are live ladies and gentlemen, but you knew that you, you can hear us. We need to come up with a better way to start these fucking things.

Speaker 2:          00:00:12       You have to have like we have you all heard.

Speaker 1:          00:00:14       Yeah. I think that's like trademark shit up. We'd have to pay buffer. It's like subsidies.

Speaker 2:          00:00:19       What if we did backwards live? We are.

Speaker 1:          00:00:22       Then we would have to owe Yoda money.

Speaker 1:          00:00:27       We're fucked. If we do fucked. If we don't. The Joe Rogan experience podcast is brought to you by kerosene games. A kerosene games is one of our newest sponsors and I'm. One of the things that me and brian sort of committed to when we started doing this podcast was to make sure that we didn't ever get advertised by anybody that we don't believe in. You know, just don't, don't just take someone's money if you think the product is dog shit or if you would never use it yourself. And uh, so this. So when we add somebody like kerosene games, it's, it's kind of a big deal for us. They just seem like a really cool company. They are, first of all, they're trying to make really bad ass games for iphones and IPADS and then coming out with android devices most likely in January, possibly February for so those nights like, which can be really incredible.

Speaker 1:          00:01:12       Galaxy s three are those, the Samsung galaxy note to the huge ones now you could, um, play the games on them and they're really bad ass and they're designed specifically for these sort of touchscreen devices, very intuitive controls, which is like a lot better than a game that you would get that like made to a pc first, but then sort of poured it over. So these, uh, it's just, uh, a much better way to do it. And Kerosene Games is concentrating on doing just that. And they're, they're super like high quality, beautiful looking. It's really fun. The first game is called Blade slayer. It's like some dude who's like a bionic cowboy character. Hey, returns from years at war and you just kicking ass. Okay. That's basically what it is. Fucking with this ridiculous storylines. Storylines all written. But,

Speaker 2:          00:02:00       and don't forget if you have like, like, um, like my sister just got an Ipad, my Stepdad and my dad, they all got ipads now. I wouldn't do it with my dad or my Stepdad made my dad. But like you can gift apps. If you go to the APP store, you can just send it. Like if you have a cousin that just got an Ipad, he wants a game right now that is fucking ninety nine cents and it's a good game. And guess what? Your cousin will freak out if it's first ipad or a new ipad.

Speaker 1:          00:02:21       It's ninety nine cents until the 29th of December. And then I believe they're going to, it's going to go back to, it's only two 99 after that, which is crazy. But it is, you're right, it's ninety nine cents right now. It's bad ass game. It's really cool. It's fun to play. It looked bad ass, you know? And if you're really into video games for the IPADS, it's a, it's an interesting time because they're starting to make like really cool high end games. The video graphics, the graphics processing power of those things isn't really amazing. That's how you could watch these dvds on it. Full high resolution movies. I mean there. It's the technology that they have today is awesome and it allows you to have a game like blade center. So right now until

Speaker 3:          00:03:00       December 29th, it's ninety nine cents. Go check it out. Fox. Okay. Alright. Take a bath. Go get. Get your shit together. All of you. We were also brought to you by [inaudible] dot com. That's o n n I t and a what on it is. It is a sort of a. We don't have a name for what kind of company that says because what we're trying to do is trying to sell you all things. Bad Ass. Anything that's good for you. Anything that's healthy, anything that promotes cognitive function or athletic performance or anything that can enhance your fitness. Anything that's good for your body. That's what we're trying to do. We're just trying to get you the best health nutrition and supplements that are available. We're trying to find you the best shit and sell it. Anytime I find out about anything cool, whether it's his Keith Weber Kettle Bell DVD that we're selling now we just start selling it like, why wouldn't we fucking sell it if it's bad ass sell it. That's how we feel about these BLENDTEC blenders and kettle bells and battle ropes and everything. Breastfed

Speaker 2:          00:03:57       is all that comp. What? Somebody told me too that you can put coffee beans and a BLENDTEC blender and I grind it up. You know if you don't have a no, if you don't have a coffee grinder and so I put a whole bag of coffee in there. What did it do? It caught on fire. It's dangerous and it took me like an hour to get that shit out there. It becomes. It was psychology. I started off as a smoke. No, it's like, oh damn. That shit's fucking crazy. It's like, must be able to the bean dust or something and then it. Then it just starts. It seriously got so hot that I felt it and I was like, oh no, that's. There's a fire starting in there and I turned it off.

Speaker 3:          00:04:40       Yeah. Like that's kind of an interesting thought. Like you're not supposed to blend everything.

Speaker 2:          00:04:45       No, I don't think like maybe I. ipads aren't a great idea. They blend iphone. So you've seen those ads blend BLENDTEC ads. I mean they turn an iphone into dust. How can we can do that, but it can't do coffee. That's strange. I don't know. It smelled up the whole house. Not In a good coffee. My

Speaker 3:          00:05:01       friction thing. Oh yeah. The blades go so fast that the beans smoke.

Speaker 2:          00:05:07       Yeah. Right. If you want to start a fire near a cave man and he had a Blendtec blender, that's what you would do.

Speaker 3:          00:05:12       It's awesome for celery though. I'll tell you that if fox salary up salary and Kale and cucumbers because it has water in it. Shit up. Yeah, exactly. It's weird. There's this. Really what it is is like a ridiculously powered blender. I mean it's ridiculous and it has like little cycles. It goes on, you know, like when I make that bulletproof coffee, my kids run out of the room because they're scared of the noise because it's, it's scary. It's. You should probably have like a big shield in front of you.

Speaker 2:          00:05:42       Yeah. For it. Like, like imagine having like your neighbors. If you live in an apartment complex and you have a Blendtec blender, you're doing Kale all day long. It probably fucking hate you.

Speaker 3:          00:05:50       Yeah. If you want those 6:00 AM fitness Douche bag.

Speaker 2:          00:05:53       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:05:54       Show everybody how bad ass you are by running at am. Guess what? Dummy you can run at noon to get your sleep in. It's not always good. It's always good to get up at 6:00 AM anyway. Don't blend coffee, beans or coffee. Do blend coffee beans. And don't say you listened to this podcast. Your choice. Either way I'm on it. What else do we have that's new? I think I've said everything. Oh no, that's a, that's not this this week. Um. Oh, the buffalo bars. That's another thing that we've started carrying on. We started carrying these natural buffalo jerky bars. They're fucking bad ass. I got right here. Um, but uh, they're um, they're made like this ancient Indian way with cranberries and shit. Oh. And we also have killer bee honey. Why? Because it sounds gangster as fuck. Okay. Even if it's not even quite as good as regular honey, you still ganged it from some fucking killer bees. Okay. On it. Dot Com. Use the code named Logan Rogan. That's rjn. Use that code name broken. No, just me. Use the code name broken and save yourself 10 percent off any supplements, any of that delicious hemp force and the of that super nutritious Alpha brand. All of it. Usually name Rogan. Alright. Brian, at the music for this gets ugly experience.

Speaker 3:          00:07:36       Are you okay bro?

Speaker 3:          00:07:39       There's a strange, strange feeling in the room. Ladies and gentlemen, don't know what the fuck is going on, but I do know that. Matt, how do I pronounce it? Ven Ven grin. Yes. Yes. That's it. It's a tricky one. And it, it's props to you for not changing it. Well, I thank you. A lot of people would have bailed. Has Been pronounced wrong many times. Yeah. Well, it's funny, but like parents from other, uh, like, like really, uh, countries with very unusual last names like Swartz, Negra, the amount of pressure, they must have changed our name to something that the American people can pronounce a sloppy ass bitches I would say. So I the worst is virgin. I've heard virgin many times. Salto when, when you were a virgin, was that painful? It felt bad. Matt is a professional poker player and you're a friend of our friend. Aubrey's and a Alpha brain enthusiastic. And I guess you, uh, apparently he said that you help like fighters sometimes with their mental game planning. Yes. I have two fighters right now, Martin Kelman and calmly that I've worked with. So I basically just focused on getting them present mentally before their fights because poker. Sorry, go ahead. No, please go. Because poker is basically like 95 percent mental. So I've found ways to prepare myself

Speaker 4:          00:08:56       and you know, I think it helps with mma because it's pure competition and if you're not there mentally, you know, it doesn't matter how good you are, you can get caught really easy if you're not paying attention.

Speaker 1:          00:09:05       Yeah. That's a subtle aspect to a, to fighting that. I think a lot of people aren't aware of the fact that a guy can look exactly the same and be moving up, but he could have lapses. There's mental lapses that happened in some guys. Those mental lapses sort of defined their careers because they have a lot of talent, but they, for whatever reason, they can never put it together.

Speaker 4:          00:09:26       Absolutely. Yeah. I mean if you get caught with one submission, just one second off you could, you could be out, you know, you could be tapping and it's the same thing with poker that's wives saw the both were kind of correlated and I wanted to do something new and different. That hasn't really been done. How did you get brought in on this? On which the coaching. You know, one day I was, I actually was watching Martin fight and I saw, um, a lapse in his eyes where he was kind of looking one way and then he was kind of lackadaisical for a minute and it got put away and I was like, which was after Paul, Tiago, I think it was, um, yeah, the one after policy I'll go. He had a loss. It was one, it was his first loss out of his three that he had.

Speaker 4:          00:10:07       He had three. And then you had two wins. Do you know which one that was? I don't really remember. I'll look it up. Yeah, well anyway, yeah, I saw him kind of like get out of, out of the moment. I saw like I can see it in people's eyes usually because playing poker you can kind of see that. And uh, so I contacted him on facebook and we just, we met about three months later and I said, hey, I want to do this. I've never done it, you know, would you like to be the first? And he said, sure. So

Speaker 1:          00:10:31       That's interesting. Now when you brought up that you saw that to him, did he resist it? Did he, did he agree with you? Like what? You know? Because a lot of times this is a strange, it's a hard issue for fighters. They're very emotionally attached to their work and so if you'll say like, hey man, you know, you got this, you got to be careful with the way you keep your chin, like you're going to get hit. Like you have to do something about that. And if you say that like they'll get angry at you and it's almost like they want to keep their chin up to show that you are wrong. That's just their ego. It is a weird thing though with, with fighters. It is. So when you, a guy who is a professional poker player, a, a non fighter goes, you know, as far as to say that you saw the actual moment where a guy like Martin Kampmann who's a fucking professional killer, you know what I'm saying? I mean mark kamins bad motherfuckers. So for you to like bring that up and for him to accept it, first of all, it shows that he's a smart dude. Absolutely. He's, he's a very, you know, aware guy and that's why he's so good. He's been very open

Speaker 4:          00:11:31       when he's able to step outside of himself and learn things that you know, that most people wouldn't consider learning. And I think that's really important for growth, you know, as a fighter or you know, mentally, whatever you want to call it.

Speaker 1:          00:11:41       Well he got caught by Johnny Hendricks in his last fight. But you know what man at first of all, that guy can catch anybody like that. We didn't work together. His last fight, we worked for his three win streak. We work

Speaker 4:          00:11:51       the other. We actually kind of had a disagreement on pricing. So we didn't work together. The last one,

Speaker 1:          00:11:55       dude, that's a terrible thing to happen. Yeah. Wow. You guys had a disagreement over money.

Speaker 4:          00:12:02       Yeah. I shouldn't say that. We shouldn't talk about what, what it actually was. It was just the disagreement. Not a fair to Mr Kamin sure. That sucks. Any sexual tension? No Martins is stuck. What can I say in, gives into the feeling? I just let it go.

Speaker 1:          00:12:22       Got Cameron. I'm a big fan of that dude. I love that fight with, um, with um, uh, thiago Silva where he was losing the fight and Tiago sheets for that takedown and gets that nasty get locks it in. That's one thing about camping. He's a kid yet. Why? Yeah. He's very, very tough, very tough. And people to sleep on his technique. His Jujitsu is nasty,

Speaker 4:          00:12:47       is you just, it was just as good as his, uh, his striking is underrated. Yeah. And he was wrestling. Takedown defense is excellent.

Speaker 1:          00:12:54       But like, like, um, uh, when he fought. I'm the dude out of the military camp. I'm blanking on his name real quick. I'll find it in a second. But, um, uh, that dude has some serious, serious knockout power and uh, he took them down and submitted them. This is Jeremy Foundries and this is back in. He's funny at one of your factories can bang a big guy's scary power. He's got serious, serious power. He never, for whatever reason, never completely put it together, had some good wins, but never completely couldn't put it together. But a cameraman caught him in the arm triangle and put them asleep and that was in camp. Was fighting at one 85, you know, he's not even a big one. 70. No he's not. He doesn't cut much. No, I mean you can tell. I mean those guys like the really big guys that get down to one 70 and you're standing next to him.

Speaker 1:          00:13:41       Like, what the Fuck Demian Maia do Damien Maia has gigantic. That guy's really big. Yes. It doesn't even look like it's the same weight class sometimes. I'm just like, Whoa, what's going on here? Yeah, like thiago alves talk about. Oh my God, he is the brick shit house. You know? And the dude gets all the way down to one 70 and you're like, wow, I don't know a couple of those att guys. There's a guy named glazing, glazing, bow. He's another one. This guy, I am not kidding you ladies and gentleman, he looks like he weighs 200 pounds and he's fighting at 1:55. He's so fucking big, he, I mean he might get as high as like one 80 come fight time, you know, and then when you're 80 and you're swollen up with blood, like when you, you know, you're pumped because you're in like a brutal fight and you look at them sometimes you go, Oh fuck, is that guy won 55? How is that even possible? It's mind boggling to me at least. Yeah. That's a weird aspect of the sport of MMA. Um, did you uh, mentally coach them on that as well? Like the weight cutting?

Speaker 4:          00:14:41       No, no, I, you know, hardly cuts. No. See you were talking earlier about, you know, it's hard to tell a fighter, you know, that as a killer what to do. But I try to separate the two completely because I'm a big MMA fan. I've watched like every UFC for probably four years and uh, I can't, I like as much as I want to chime in about technique or whatever. I know that, you know, that's just not my right. That's expert. Right, exactly. So I try to keep it separate.

Speaker 3:          00:15:05       You're just concentrating on them having a winning mindset. Is that what it is? I want them to get to beating the winning everything

Speaker 4:          00:15:11       on their mind. I want to get off their mind. I want them to just deal with anything that they might be thinking about, whether it be a, what's my next I want. I want them to stay present. I don't want them to think too much about the past or the future. I want them to just be right there for that. And that's the only thing that matters. That's my goal.

Speaker 3:          00:15:27       And how do you, how do you address their, what they normally think about? Like when, when sometimes like big one. I, I've always seen with fighters one of the worst, his girlfriend problems when fighters have girlfriend problems. Man, when shit goes bad like that can, that can signify like a huge skid in their career.

Speaker 4:          00:15:48       Sure. Well, you know, um, both of the fighters are happily married, so that's not an issue for me, but how I would probably tackle it, you know, it's hard to get that stuff off your head, you know, you can feel like that's taking over, you know, when you break up with someone, it just feels like you can't get away from that, you know, and uh, most of the time it's just because you've never faced that, you've never really faced it down and you kind of just push it aside and put it in the back of your mind. But the way that, the way to really do it, it's just address it, you know, go back to exactly what happened and just deal with it, you know, as a man

Speaker 3:          00:16:15       and new pussy. Yeah. And it's also very important. You cannot try to like, you know what, I'm just going to get my own shit together. Stop, go get laid. What are you crazy? Okay. I'm not saying go fall in love, but go get your freak on best medicine ever. Yeah. With someone who would also like to get the freak out with you. Okay. Mutually beneficial, that needs to be recognized that it is mutually beneficial and that's the only reason why it's any good. We don't understand their point of view and they don't understand are part of you. That's true in medicine. Puts it. You can die from if you take it with the wrong things. Yes. You definitely die and or just ruin your life and wish you were dead. Yeah. That's sometimes worse. Sometimes worse. Sometimes pussies worse than suicide. How about that? It's like the Red Dye and the Jelly Bean.

Speaker 3:          00:16:58       Yeah. We all know that one new to just can't keep it together. When it comes to girls, you know the guy's a little chicks dominate their life and yell at them and tell them what to do and it's a. it's a spooky thing when you see that kind of shit happened. Well it becomes really real for them. Right? I mean like I try to think of it as like, it's not that serious really in the scheme of things. It's not really that serious. It is to them in that moment. In that moment it is separation anxiety and it's just as bad. Of course, uh, for uh, you know, women that are involved with crazy fucked up men too that are trying to dominate your life probably even more worse because it's scary physically. Like the threat of physical violence is much more prevalent.

Speaker 4:          00:17:33       It's especially if they try to tell you what to do with your life and their life is kind of in shambles. Like a lot of people want to give advice, you know, when they, when they don't have their shit together.

Speaker 3:          00:17:41       Yeah, it's hilarious. But this is related on twitter today. Some dude sent me some, a thing on twitter, like some comment about how I, you know, I need to uh, behave. And so I was like, you know, that I need to like take a dose of my own medicine or something like that. One of them, you know, one of those sort of things. So I'd go and look at his twitter profile real quick. And his last tweet was about how he was depressed coming off of a coke binge. And, and I'm like, do you think that like you should be giving advice to someone about how they should think like we're 30 seconds ago you were talking about coming off some off your first year. Maybe you can say something that doesn't seem like the type of person should be given that advice.

Speaker 5:          00:18:29       I found out that liquid coke was, you know how the liquid coke they're using that they're also using it because girls can put it in them and squirting their pussies before sex and they're buttholes and it numbs it down. So you can just go to town on it. If you put it in your Dick Hole, it feels like you have the biggest dick hole in the whole entire world. Like the bones just gonna slide out like a hot dog. Man. That sounds terrible. Oh, you just gave people an idea. Could you imagine? Could you imagine getting so fucked up with regular sex? Do you want to shoot coke in your Dick? Like yeah, sex. Just not doing it for me anymore man. But I found that like tubes up my ass. The hardest part is getting that first part, like stretching your whole life to fit the whole nose thing of the nose spray, which is that what you would use on your nose, nasal spray, a nasal spray, and I guess a saline solution so it's used for your eyes, so your Dick cries all the time so it's fine, but then eventually their pussy and asshole is going to start being numb and then we're going to be in a horrible pain.

Speaker 5:          00:19:31       They probably going to have infections and shit. That's all I'd be thinking about why we're doing it, but like she can't even feel this. What Joey Dee dee is it just cleans it right out. Joe. First of all, Joey Diaz is not even a human. So what are you saying? The laws that apply to normal humans. Just think about what Joe has done and here he is, fine. Healthy, still alive and made a baby recently. Now stop and think about the average human being. If they go through Joey Diaz, his life. Have you had to go through Joey Diaz his life and take all the drugs that he took? Find yourself in all the situations you find. Good luck reaching 50. Good luck reaching where Joey is, but you can't, so he's not even human. No. You gave Joey Diaz is live to 100 people. Ninety nine

Speaker 6:          00:20:14       be dead. That's a fact.

Speaker 5:          00:20:18       We've. JDS was a robot. When it goes home, his whole body opens up into smaller little Jewish guy comes down and says, hey, how's it going? I got to pay me working all the mechanicals. That's why its stomach so hard because his stomach is like a knee. He touched joey stomach. It's not like A. There's some dudes like give India. You know you're hugging when they're really big. They just given to you, joey, as you run into him. It's like thump. It feels like you're sitting on a really hard rock. I'm saying if he's on one side of the plan, you should sit on the other balance of bitch out. That's what I'm. That's

Speaker 1:          00:20:48       what I'm saying. Okay. Joe. He does a solid dude. He's. He's not just a. he's not fat. He's a solid guy and his head is gigantic. Which a problem. You try to lose some weight. That's a weird thing with dudes like my friend Justin giant dude and I looked at the size of his head. I'm like, that is also a giant head. Like if that was on a normal person's body, like, like when you get really big, if you get like, you know, certain dudes they get like incredibly obese will everything grows and then when they bring their body in, when they lose the weight, it looks very strange. It's like what's going on? Like why is his head's so big? Like, what's, is it good? I'm used to this giant Bonnie and it's just unusual for me or why? What is, what's going on here? That's a sad thing though. When you see someone who's, uh, lost their marbles so bad, the eat themselves into oblivion. You know, when you read about like people that get stuck in trailers and they got to cut a hole through the wall, pull their couch out in, bedded into the couch. It's fucked to know that people can go that far off the rails.

Speaker 2:          00:21:57       Do you ever watch Dr Oz? I've watched it before. What do you think about him? He's not that bad. Right. He's pretty interesting. He seems like he's pretty legit.

Speaker 1:          00:22:04       Nice guy. It doesn't seem like he's a bad guy, you know, I, as long as they're not like super judgmental and like tough guy. He liked doctor Phil is on occasion that, you know, I don't, I don't like that attitude. Like if you, if you really want to help people's, you need to get your act together. That's not how you help people. Stupid. No, that's nonsense. You're dealing be rating them on television but he doesn't seem like that kind of a doctor. So yeah, he's a medical doctor to actual real doctor. Right.

Speaker 2:          00:22:36       I was, I was just watching Dr Oz. I've never seen it before. It got really baked and it was, he has this thing like, you know, everyone, three out of four people are super tired and there it's because they don't have enough of this one medicine or, or, or nutrient or whatever the fuck it is. And uh, they, they brought these three women, this woman was, he's like, I can fix all your shit using this one thing that you have to take every day. Multiple Times a day and they're like, well, it's because I have four kids, I have to wake up every morning at six and do this and this and this is like vitamin, it's magnesium and, and, and uh, on, it should get on top of magnesium because he said the thing is, is that they don't have it in daily multivitamins because it be so big of a pill because you have to take it all day long so you have to get out of food and there's like certain food, like bananas, spinach, a Chenwa and all that stuff that has a high amount of it and it. But if you don't have any of that, you're just running on empty and your body has to like freak out and that's, we get irritable. That's when you're just like tired and fatigue all the time. And I don't know if there's a way to have magnesium every day easy, but it seems like that's, that's a big thing.

Speaker 1:          00:23:40       Yeah. I took it at night. I take Zma. That's the stuff that, that Victor, Conte gut also says is a natural testosterone booster or one of the most effective ones. I'd take that over.

Speaker 2:          00:23:50       I take it every night too. And I, he sent me a case.

Speaker 3:          00:23:52       No, actually I didn't take it last night, so I'm lying. I can't say every night and it's great if you're flag. Sometimes I forget and it's great if you're sick and some of them have a Tryptophan or what not. Trip defendant some something else. Treat. Defend is a,

Speaker 1:          00:24:05       that it's possible that they could have that in there. You know, everybody makes their own little, a nutritional supplement sorta concoctions. But um, yeah, zinc is also a, that's a, it's like it's a healthy mineral, you know, it's like your body should have it anyway and we should. There's a lot of shit that we should take man, that we don't take. Most people just like barely get the amount of required daily vitamins in their diet and most people are not taking vitamin supplements and then most people are not eating that much vegetables either. I'm like, man, you are rolling the fucking dice with your body. You know, you got to give your body nutrients if you don't give your body nutrients. It just fucking misfires. And w the why. Intelligent people neglect. That to me drives me nuts because you can do both. You've seen me eat, I eat shit. I'll eat shit. I'll eat cheeseburgers, I'll go off. But I also supplement the fuck out of everything. I make sure I'm always taken vitamins and for the most part when I'm not eating a fucking pastrami sandwich, I will eat really healthy. So I'll allow myself these like French fry binges and shit. But for the most part I'm eating really healthy.

Speaker 2:          00:25:10       But if you really stone watching Dr Oz, you're like okay, this woman says she eats healthiest. Heck she has the greatest diet ever. She's just tired all the time. And the other girl was like, no, I have 15 kids. I'm, I eat normal. Like I, I probably have enough. Magnesium is probably not magnesium and not like a 25 year old crack addict, you know? And, and, and he just like blew it off. Like all. Alright, see magnesium. What's the secret? And then he moves onto this next girl, she's like, I can't poop. I tried everything. I tried yogurts, I try fruit and stuff like that. And he goes, well, you need to try live culture, yogurt and raspberries. And she's just, like I just said, I've tried yogurt and fruits and stuff like that. And it was just like, move on. I'm Dr Oz to Dr Oz. And it's just a bunch of little fails. He has good advice, but the shows is a bunch of little fails over and over again. I highly recommend watching Dr. I was super stoked.

Speaker 3:          00:25:55       Oh Wow. Nice. I wonder if there's a collection of Dr Oz's fails and if that sounds okay.

Speaker 2:          00:26:02       Not like half the time it's the people even say anything. You could just tell by their faces. They're like, I just told you fruit in.

Speaker 3:          00:26:10       I think I got something wrong. There can be something really wrong with you when there's some people they have to do poop transplants. So have you heard of this, where you take my picture and put it in your butt wherever? Yes. Yes. I'm not joking. I wonder if it. Whether they do it between family members. That's a really interesting question. Um, but, but it's true. It really is true. They need fecal transplants. What do they think of next? I think fucking saves people's lives, man. Really? Man. Science as a mother Fucker, isn't it? It's just they're always coming up with some incredible shit that just makes you go. How did this even happen? Well, I, I always find interesting to look back and be like, Oh, well, 20 years ago or whatever, a long time ago, lobotomies were considered, you know, normal, right? Like how it changes how science changes.

Speaker 3:          00:26:56       Like, Oh, our bad. Yeah, that's not good. We can't really do that anymore. I would like to think that we're way past that. I would like to. We're way past the law bottomy stage. I would like to think that they pretty much know exactly what everything does as far as like what the negative health benefit or repercussions are. But then you see pharmaceutical drugs and you find out that's not really the case. I see like every week some new thing gets fucking yanked off the shelves from recall signs of maybe they did do a lot of good though too. I mean there's a lot of people that are alive because of pharmaceutical drugs because a lot of people that they have illnesses and they literally keeps them alive. I uh, I had back surgery a couple years ago and the pain pills they have are amazing. Like I had shit no after, uh, after I healed up I got off on.

Speaker 3:          00:27:49       But like before that. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. Actually I know, I tried to get off them. Here's what happened. I, I, I tried to quit cold Turkey and I got physically ill, like my whole body just felt like I wanted to die and I was like, oh. I was like, all right, I better weaned myself off and stuff. So I just did like two and then one. And what specifically were you taking hydrocodone? I think it was hydrocodone. Is that the same as Oxycontin or oxycodone is what it's called and maybe it sounds kind of someone. I don't know. I'm not a doctor. Yeah, those, uh, it's an opiate based hoping it will be a base, but that will mess your body. Like I can understand why people get addicted because like I said, I tried to get off and it just, my whole body was like wanting to die.

Speaker 3:          00:28:28       I felt like. So it just, uh, you, you get it, it gets attached to your stuff basically. Yeah. Kinda like a, uh, you know, that Spiderman, Velma was that the black van them, right? Yeah, sort of like that. Like it just Kinda Tanya isn't crazy that they just trust that people are going to have the willpower to get through those. I mean, it is crazy. It's crazy. It's nuts that they're allowing people to become junkies. Like literally anything like that that can get a normal look. There's, there's certain people that could get addicted to almost anything. They have a mental illness. It's a mental issue, but there's a physical addiction is a completely different story. You're not talking about some weird thing like washing your hands or playing poker. You're talking about something crazy where you've gotten your body physically addicted. This for its new system, this is the system, the system is heroin and terrorists runs on. It's like you have some business chick who's a clip was got a clipboard in their hand and she's like leading on a tour through your body. We started incorporating heroine three years ago. Without it, we die, you know, so this is where the heroin comes in. These are holes. See this, this is called gang green's. What happened to you on 10 to your holes? But you get someone hooked on something like that. It's so hard for them to stop.

Speaker 1:          00:29:42       Yeah. It's why it's the most evil thing in the world to be selling. Things like that. Knowing that you don't have to, you know, knowing that this must be alternatives. I understand there's some people that are in intense pain, especially people that are about to die, you know? And maybe it'd be good for that. Sure. But for the most part, most people,

Speaker 4:          00:30:00       well, most people don't need it. Shouldn't give them the. Most people don't eat it.

Speaker 1:          00:30:04       Yeah. So how did you engineer your back?

Speaker 4:          00:30:08       Uh, it was like a genetic thing basically, like out of pineal cyst on my tailbone, so I had to get it like a 12 inch portion of my back taken out. It sucks. Oh my God. It's all healed now. But it was terrible for like 60. You were a foot taller than you are now, is that what you're saying? I was actually eight feet and six inches. Three years. He was like a foot shorter. Yeah, they wouldn't let me play in the NBA anymore.

Speaker 1:          00:30:32       You, um, so this, is this how you got involved with, um, like a, like mind over body type shit in the first place because you were like that whole John Sarno type thing? No, what's up John Sarno was this guy. Oh, the, the doctor that believes there's a mind body connection with back injuries and shit like that. Have you ever heard?

Speaker 4:          00:30:55       Yes, I have now. I remember. Um, what do you believe? I believe you do. I believe it. Yeah, I think um, I, uh, I feel like I didn't have much support back then and I think that's what the bank is support in your life. You know what I mean? So for me it's real. I mean, I don't know. That's how I feel at least.

Speaker 1:          00:31:13       So you have this injury you haven't repaired? Yeah. And how long did it take before you were like 100 percent. Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:31:18       That was like, I'm five months of, of basically nothingness.

Speaker 1:          00:31:24       I'm asking you all these questions because I just discovered recently have a bulging disc. I have a bulging disc in my back. It's not bad. It's not really bad. Like I can still do, I can do kickboxing and no problem. I do all these strength and conditioning exercises. No problem. My problem only comes when I do Jujitsu and I get my head yanked on that was going to say that again when you're defending from something it's because it's in the middle of my back and it's hustle found out to my posture is dog shit most was already. So I'm trying to sit up straight and put, you know, it's like I sit like this all the time and apparently that's bad.

Speaker 4:          00:31:58       I'm the exact same way and I feel like I don't like doing this because it feels like I'm just putting out my boobs saw the boy looks at it. Yeah. Especially I'm trying to look less Douchey, not more Jewish. This makes me look more Douchey,

Speaker 1:          00:32:09       like sitting straight up, like I can be more chill like this, you know what I'm saying? But this is like way better for your body. Sit Straight. But then someone said this is John Sarno book and then I should read it so I shouldn't really shouldn't comment until I read it, but. But I'm not in pain like all the time. It's a weird thing to try to describe to people because it's like saying, well it only hurts when I do two digits or they'll just say, don't do Jujitsu. I know exactly what you're saying, but it's don't do. Jujitsu is not really that much of an option for me. It's been annoying that I haven't been able to do it regularly for the past five months while this thing has been healing up. So I'm trying all sorts of different ways, but I, I know it's a real injury, like that's the weird thing.

Speaker 1:          00:32:46       Like when someone says it's like, you know, senior mine man. Well it may manifest the same. Yeah, I think it's like it may manifest itself if you're thinking about it where you have issues in that area. But who knows. I mean that's hard though because it manifested itself defending a triangle guy was trying to fucking tapped me and I'm trying to get out and I'm using my back. That's what it manifested itself. I don't, I just, I'm not being defensive and to start starnell fans will jump in right now and go, come on. Moon full could choose you. Said you didn't. I will read the book and I will read the book with a 100 percent open mind. But you can't tell me that that injury happened because of my mind or that there's pain because of my mind because I'm not really like a Weirdo and uh, I'm not buying that shit.

Speaker 1:          00:33:30       Alright. I don't have this like self hating thing going on. I don't have any tension as far as my life goes and I'm carrying in my back. No, I tried to get out of something and I hurt my back. Sure. Like this is like tissue and it tears, so that's where like scientists go fucking bananas and a lot of medical doctors that replaced disks. They go bananas when they hear this shit like, listen bitch, you got bone on bone. You don't have a desk anymore. You're gonna be in pain, period. No matter what this guy says in his wacky book, if you have like a real physical injuries back, injuries are tricky, man. They're the worst I think because it's like, well, well he would be saying, and I'm not saying he's wrong in saying this, but what he would be saying by saying that somehow know that you control where you're injured and control, like where you feel pain because of your emotional state.

Speaker 1:          00:34:17       What we're basically saying is that you're. You're creating your life and your own imagination and your body is just one physical manifestation of you creating your own life, which I'm not. I'm not willing to argue with it may be very well the case, but you if you want to carry the logic of thinking that your mind controls pain and actual injuries aren't real or are created by your own mind, well you've got to carry that all the way, bitch. You got to take that all away and say the universe is something that you're creating in your own mind because you're talking about physical reality being manifested by the imagination and your intent. Okay? Well, just because it's your body doesn't mean it's any less crazy voodoo talk. That's still crazy Voodoo talk and I'm not saying it's wrong, but I'm saying if you believe that you really should take it to the utmost and say, well, we're living in a fucking dream.

Speaker 1:          00:35:05       Okay? Life is your imagination manifested in some sort of a representation of a true form, but there is no true form behind it. We're getting deep. It was. That's the only way you're going to fucking tell me that your emotions and your, your, your mind is why you have a back pain. Like maybe you got hit by a car bitch. Okay? Know that's all possible to like this idea that there's this physical manifestation is because of your intent and because of your mind, because of your emotions. If that is even at possible, then you've got to take that all the way. That means your physical intent. It's probably controlling everything. It's probably not just controlling your body is probably controlling your environment as well. If it's controlling your environment, how much of it is how much everything outside of it is real? That's a good question.

Speaker 1:          00:35:53       It's a great question. I mean I put this on online and a lot of people gave me a lot of really good advice, so I wanted to thank them. Especially dudes on the underground gave me a lot of mixed martial arts. Star comes the underground forum. They gave me a lot of great advice on how to Rehab and Palati seems to come up a lot. Yoga seems to come up a lot and that book seems to come up a lot as well, so I'm going to check it out. Travolta, backroads, Travolta back, rubs and fucking uncomfortable because you never know when it's Dick's coming out. Hey, you know, if she would travolta would say, Hey, let me rub you theirs, which is what his move was. Do you know that there was one of the moves that he would do on the guys, wasn't that efficient?

Speaker 1:          00:36:30       Auto Travolta, a back rub lore. Not that I'm hating the guy and I say, listen man, you knew what the fuck you were getting into. If you're a professional background guy and you guys don't have like a website or something, we can go and tell about which guys want to get jerked off. Okay. If you don't have that by now and you and Travolta's come a new for 20 years, that's on you. Okay? You guys need to either accept the job. You know what he wants, he wants you to jerk them off. That's you're trying to diversify. You saw pulp fiction, jerk them off. Just check them off.

Speaker 4:          00:36:59       I didn't talk about my backup. I had the other day. You shouldn't talk about it. I sent and talk about that. No, no. That's awesome. The one that was in San Diego, things can get closed down. Yeah. The one in San Diego, right in the border. Don't, don't tell a story. Stories, a story. We got to be careful about talking about illegal shit as this patriot. Hey, it's, it's made up. I'm making it different. We have to say that every story we tell alleged now on, allegedly I say allegedly, it's kind of cool. Shut the fuck up. Okay. Just stop it right now. I didn't know that existed. So you're um, uh, who you working with right now with fighters you work on? Just calmly and I talk. I'm talking to Martin a little bit now. And when you started working with Martin, he was the first guy.

Speaker 4:          00:37:45       First Guy. Yeah. I just said, hey, you know, I've never done this before. I kind of want to experiment on somebody. What made you like want to like reach out to a fighter and devise a while? I love them. I'm a number one. It's like the purest form of competition there is I think right now. So that's why I love it because I'm very competitive. I grew up playing games and video games and poker is obviously a perfect choice for my lifestyle now. Um, but uh, I don't know, I just felt like doing something different, man, you know, just, just trying something new, creating something out of nothing. So.

Speaker 1:          00:38:19       And Martin Kemp was just like, fuck it at me. Like what did you say specifically there? Really liked knocked him on his ass because like I said, smart dude, smart guy, tough guy, very successful fighter. Like what did you say to him? Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:38:31       Follow my solid champion inside of him and I wanted to be part of bringing it up. Yeah, I would think you were trying to fuck

Speaker 3:          00:38:36       me. Wouldn't you say? Wouldn't you say that?

Speaker 2:          00:38:40       Yeah, let me come over and get some Chardonnay back massages and uh, yeah, yeah, it doesn't sound. You would just assume

Speaker 3:          00:38:48       some bad sex was going on, you know, maybe Martin Kampmann just thought of it as a sparring session. Like, this dude is going to come on my house trying to get some butts X. I'm going to light them up. And in the way, all the way, he actually got some great, great advice. It could be like an ABC after school special. He thought he was gonna. Get some free sparring in. I told him I wasn't going to talk about that on the podcast about the butts. That's all what we already established that everything we say is fiction. So don't worry about it. Martin, your secret's safe with us. Ariel, is that guy always a girl? If it's got a big area. He's a boy rather. No, the only big role is or girls. Puerto Ricans have used a few. Cute. Have you ever seen a man with really big areas? Oh my God. Are you kidding? This big as your face is Ariel Leo's. Could you? Yeah. You could wear them as a mask. Rabobank. Oh, that's cool. Yeah, he's a big boy.

Speaker 2:          00:39:45       Magic wearing a bike helmet with this aerial is on the side. What's the biggest Ariel's you've ever seen a girl? Oh, there was. This one was a sad story that somebody sent me the other day. Uh, it's this girl that was at playboy playboy model in the seventies or eighties. And she was like super famous, very beautiful, and she recently died in San Francisco, like on the streets as a homeless person and stuff. And it just shows her like how she used to look and imagine her life going there in 20 years or whatever.

Speaker 3:          00:40:14       No, it's fucked up somewhere in her life. Some guy probably if it, if not set it, at least thought I hope that bitch ones up old and homeless and living on the street with no one to love her. You know what I mean? I hope she dies in a car accident, you know? Oh, someone. Someone wished that to Brian. I was just saying. Yeah, this one's how rude. So silly. That's never should hope no one ever dies ever in a car accident for the rest of the time. A great show. You reptilian skin lady. Um, but whatever. Yeah. Putting that kind of intense.

Speaker 2:          00:40:47       Oh, did you hear about Lindsay Lohan is like really pissed off at the scary movie five trailer they just had, has charlie sheen in it. And let me tell you something. I don't give a fuck, but Kat Williams Williams is in this trailer and it makes me wonder if this whole Katt Williams thing, which some brilliant fucking marketing thing because if you look at it, it's like a miniature early when look at it and Kat Williams is in it.

Speaker 3:          00:41:09       If you want to play it. Look, I'm a big Cat Williams fan and when I see Kat Williams getting in trouble and all this shit that, you know why that drives me nuts because I want to hear some new standup. I think that guy's a brilliant comedian. He's one of my favorites, so when I see them it makes me sad like I can't. I don't take any joy in watching that guy fall apart. Eric, check this out if he's falling apart, but if it's all fake, see if it's. What do you think? Because it's. I don't think, I don't think

Speaker 2:          00:41:34       you would ever like do that. His fans. If it was all fake.

Speaker 6:          00:41:42       Someone else. Killer open front door. There's no need for that

Speaker 2:          00:41:56       bitch.

Speaker 6:          00:42:06       Stop. Stop.

Speaker 2:          00:42:10       This movie could give you aids that you might get aids just watching this trailer. I know this might be the worst movie ever. Tell me if you think this is really Leonardo Dicaprio.

Speaker 6:          00:42:20       Of course it starts to. It starts off, so loony tunes and it starts off really shitty. Then it gets kind of like interesting professional, personal demon residue. Damon's got to the bottom of this. I was told you needed a dream extract. This goes in your mouth. The other one goes in your rectum. Hang on. I'm sorry. That one goes in your mouth and the other one goes in your record. That lady told me there's always some ballerina who won't give up the spotlight. I danced the swan when I was pregnant with you. This is not badly. Don't inhale

Speaker 2:          00:43:18       judy footage that the old owner. Stop this right now. This is the craziest. Okay. Charlie Sheen is in bed with Lindsay Lohan. Lindsay Lohan's not mad that she's getting portrayed as fucking Charlie Sheen. Let's. Let's just say, by the way, is this like what she had to do to get payback? Not Lindsay. Lindsay, Lindsay Lohan. This is Charlie Sheen. Charlie Sheen just paid like Lindsey's taxes. I don't know if you've been following that whole Charlie Sheen thing, so maybe this is payback. She has to do this film, but they fucking own her because they originally sent in this scene that they're going to. The joke is that you're working for this stupid fucking movie or something. I'm not working for the olive garden or not working for this movie. Uh, but, but then I guess, uh, they originally said was supposed to be for Herbie. Herbie supposed to be on their TV and they changed it to report them for sessions.

Speaker 6:          00:44:09       Scared. There's nothing to be. Sorry. I gotta call you back. Right. Which I guess that was. Oh, oh my God,

Speaker 2:          00:44:32       that looks horrible. Shame is the scary

Speaker 1:          00:44:35       was thinking that that clip is like this, these, these constant jokes too. Fucking up. I've come back from worse than this. Like this, this constant playing off the fact that he's like this consummate partier who rebounds and it's starting to be like parents.

Speaker 2:          00:44:49       It's scary. You can't just keep it. You can't just keep it

Speaker 1:          00:44:52       doing that. Keep talking about being a fuck up and bouncing back. Like you've got to actually do something now, Dude. Yeah. That's the scariest pre that. That is scary.

Speaker 2:          00:44:59       That's what I'm saying. Carrie Williams isn't it? And that. What's scary is that

Speaker 1:          00:45:03       people were willing to make that movie. Like they saw it and they glued it all together and they're like, well, I'm fucking. This is. This is pretty funny.

Speaker 2:          00:45:11       Whoever's in that, whoever made that movie is like a genius. It's just sitting there going, Andy Dick,

Speaker 1:          00:45:17       that's pure madness. That movie is pure madness that you will leave that movie baffled. Maybe. Maybe you love it. What the fuck do I know? Don't take your opinions for me, ladies and gentlemen, but I hope that that Kat Williams did gets his shit together or if he does have his shit together, I hope he explains himself. I think he's fucking hilarious comedian, man. You go back and watch the pimp chronicles. It's really funny. Shit, man. It's fun to watch. He was good man. He was really good. I hope he's still is. You know, I hope he can bounce back. I don't know what it is. I wouldn't want to guess as to what is happening to them, what happened to them. I don't even know about all these like cancelled shows not showing up and beating people up and shit sounds normal. I don't know fucking dudes. Larry, I'll tell you that. I think you got to be a certain amount of crazy to be able to pull off comedy, you know, especially pulled off like at Joey Diaz levels or fucking cat Williams levels or even Brian Cowen levels probably counts fucking crazy.

Speaker 2:          00:46:16       You know? It's fucking awesome. And do you ever talk to Steven Wright ever heard? I was listening to his comedy the other day. He is a hilarious course.

Speaker 1:          00:46:24       I saw that guy live like way back in the day when he first started making it before I was even a comedian. I paid to see him live and I was, I was like 18 or 19 years old. I went to see him in a concert. It was amazing.

Speaker 2:          00:46:36       He said something like, he was on this on an airplane the other day and you forgot to take the seat belt when he stood up, and then he's like, yeah, I was dragging that F or did this airplane around the lobby knocking people over with my wings.

Speaker 1:          00:46:50       He had a great joke about working out of a fire extinguisher factory. Couldn't park anywhere near the place. Just that kind of style. Yeah. He was the guy that, um, there was um, a movie that was written about or that was made about standing up called when stand standup stood out and he was the guy that really like changed the whole face of the Boston scene because he got discovered and when he got discovered, they were putting them on television all the time. Then all of a sudden everybody else wanted to get discovered to. And it sort of changed it from everybody was just going out and trying to kill, just be the funniest people you could to everybody wanting to try to get a TV. So he likes sort of by his success, unfortunately tanked the entire boss. He was the first step in the entire Boston comedy scene. Slowly degenerating over time.

Speaker 2:          00:47:39       I don't get steven right in my face though, like know how you get Louis C, k everywhere he goes. Let me see. Katie, you know, David Tomlinson, but I don't see him at all. One of the reasons is that

Speaker 1:          00:47:48       was not nearly as prolific as Louis. One of the things that so amazing about Louise, not just that he's funny, but he's so prolific, like Louis puts out a whole new hour every year and he's constantly writing and because of that, you're, if you're a fan, like I'm a fan of Steven, right? But was the last time I saw Steven Wright, special ones last time, you know, uh, I downloaded one of his mp3s. It's very, very rare because he only has a certain body of work and I'm through with that. I've already eaten through it. Whereas with a guy like Louis, if you're a fan, you're continually refreshed with new stuff. Like every year you're going to get a whole new hour. You're going to get all these interviews in between. So it's like you, the relationship between the fan and the comedian, like it makes sense. It doesn't make sense that I'm still fans with Steven Wright are fans of Stephen. Right. But I haven't heard any of this shit in a long time. But if he was like a dude like Louie, that was like banging it out every year. Like an hour every year. Yeah. He would hear about them everywhere. It's not that he's not hilarious. He's awesome. Just doesn't work that much.

Speaker 2:          00:48:48       A Sitcom with Steven Wright and Katt Williams and they're gay levers and it's perfect because Kat Williams never slapped steven. Right. Because he's a tall and stuff, you know, probably wouldn't slap them as much. Steven Meisel, dancehall, he's pretty tall, isn't he?

Speaker 1:          00:49:00       Williams was standing on the couch and smack in your face, right?

Speaker 7:          00:49:04       Yeah. Coming. You see on the video, pop it at Walmart employee. He'll smack you.

Speaker 2:          00:49:09       Usually what Kat said Walmart employee was saying to him that way. Slap him. He called him the n word and that's why I slapped him. I don't believe that at all, but I

Speaker 7:          00:49:17       might have. You might have. And if he didn't, that's the right thing to say if you want to get out of it, I guess that too. Anyway, back to Matt. A little bit random access, but hey man, I'm enjoying it. That's how a real conversation is, you know, we'll conversations don't always go the same way. The, you, um, when you, when you started working with Martin Kampmann, did you come up with like something that you wrote down on paper? Like easily, uh, the ways to address it? Did you develop like a curriculum? Like how did you, uh, how'd you approach it? It's hard to do that because it just depends so much on every different person. You know what I mean? Depends on how much time do you want. We usually spend like, I would say a half hour now. What? I mean advanced to work with them before a fight.

Speaker 7:          00:50:02       Oh yeah, yeah. About two months. In two months. Yeah. So d all through like heavy training. You're there? Yeah. I mean I don't go to his gym that much. I went to extreme for a couple of times, just kinda hung out and just saw his body language and stuff like that, but mostly it's just on the phone or I'll go over to his house and we'll have of chat it out and see what's on his mind and you know, just try to get it off there. And um, you, uh, did you develop legere course for how to,

Speaker 1:          00:50:28       how you handle this kind of

Speaker 8:          00:50:29       man? I'm still so new to this. I don't even know what I'm doing. Sometimes you just have

Speaker 1:          00:50:33       some really good ideas about being able to be in the moment.

Speaker 8:          00:50:37       Yeah, the bottom line is just getting them present. That's the only thing that I'm concerned about is just getting them to the point where they're not thinking about their acts or whatever's on their mind where they can just be in that cage and all that matters is what's in front of them because if they go, if they, like I said, we talked about before, one second away from the moment they're gone, they could get knocked out, you know? So

Speaker 1:          00:50:57       what is like, can you tell us like what's a, what's a good way? Like say if you've got something on your mind that's fucking with you, what's a good way to get that out of your mind to smoke, smoke weed and deal with it? Smoke weed and deal with it.

Speaker 8:          00:51:09       No, I mean, do you know that's a joke. But uh, I'm not as funny as you. I'm trying. Okay. You gave it a shot. Yeah. Thank you. Um, yeah, I mean just, just to deal with it. Most people, like I said, they'll push it aside, they'll pretend like it's not there.

Speaker 1:          00:51:21       Right. But for some people it's not that easy to just deal with things like I'll just, I mean, is there a tool that you could give someone, you know, like that they could take away like, oh, let me look at it this way now. Instead it was like maybe a loss loss in the family, the loss of a pad or something like that. You know, for a lot of people that shit is like absolutely devastating. It's really hard for them to move on. Right. Do you what, what do you do? Like if you're dealing with a fighter and he has an issue, whatever it is, girlfriend, issue, loss, issue, whatever it is, how do you get them to like, let that truck go.

Speaker 8:          00:51:53       You got to get them to go back to that moment and live it again because they haven't got, they're not okay with it one way or another. They're just not okay with it, so they have to go back and really go through what was going on. So in, you know,

Speaker 1:          00:52:04       so you feel that a lot of times when people keep things in their mind or distractions, it's unresolved issues. It is absolutely. Mostly from childhood actually. Yeah. Yeah. Now how do you address that? You say do, like when you're, when you're working with a fighter, do you dress like specific areas of their child that. I mean, how far do you go with that?

Speaker 8:          00:52:24       Well, they, it'll come up in conversation, you know, they'll one way or another they'll tell me like what the issue is and then we'd just go deal with it. I mean, it's, it's hard though because a lot of people don't want to do that. They don't want to deal with. They've been living with it for so long. They're just like, you know, that's the way it is for them.

Speaker 1:          00:52:40       Yeah. It's like, it makes it difficult for them to, uh, to Sorta if they let it go like that. If the game's over. Yeah.

Speaker 8:          00:52:47       Phil let it go. The game's over. They don't get because they're mostly, they're getting something out of it. That's the reason why they keep doing it. Even as a traumatic experience or something bad. They're getting something out of it, whether it be people feeling bad for them or whatever it is for them. There'll be getting something out of it until they can let that go and, and that game and move on. It's just gonna. It's like groundhog day over and over.

Speaker 1:          00:53:07       Yeah. When you meet someone and they have an issue like that and they keep repeating and it's so fucking frustrated. Yes. It's so frustrating. I went through it. Um, I've gone through it a couple times with my friends with drugs, you know, and a, or an o or alcohol, you know, when someone has just got that where they will, they'll get sober for a couple months and then they fuck up and then, you know, it's like, like literally, like they're stuck in like a, any like what are you doing? Like, why are you in this little track? This is a terrible track, you know, the maze, you know, you can just go that way. You can just have to. Yeah, this is your fucking crazy. Put it down. Pretend you're talking to yourself on the table. What would you tell yourself to do? Would you tell yourself to keep repeating these same stupid fucking patterns?

Speaker 1:          00:53:53       He went to yourself for advice. But that's a weird thing with people. So a lot of people were good about giving advice but their own life, they can't follow that know. Me Too sometimes. Look, I'm human. It happens with me too, you know? Oh, for sure. Yeah. You know? Yeah. It's, it's hard. It's hard to turn that same. You know, when you look at other people you can look at, I'm pretty objective. You're not attached to their success or failure. You see them for what they are for the most part or what you know, what they represent to you, but yourself. That's hard to do that. Most people don't want to deal with their own issues. You know, lady. That's why people give advice all the time because they don't want to look inward and really work on themselves and a song that they would play on like zoom or one of those little kid shows.

Speaker 1:          00:54:37       The most important person in the whole wide world is you and you're hardly even know you. You remember that? I don't, but I don't remember it either that barely remember it. I remember that line. Remember like, what was I was six going, what is this bitch talking about? Don't even know me. I know me well. You don't know you. They don't project your bullshit on me. Six years old, I fucking know me. All right. The most important person in the whole life or help you in your even know you. Very difficult for people to look at themselves though. That's uh, that's one of the hardest things to do. Straighten out your own issues. The thing about fighting is that the stakes are so insanely high that there's even more pressure. It's because it's not just a loss like for a regular person, like say if you like to play basketball, if you have a one on one game with the guy and you're pretty sure you could beat them, but you fuck up some clutch shots and that is, you know, it doesn't feel good.

Speaker 1:          00:55:31       He's a clown. You make it funny, funnier. He smoked you in basketball. But that is so much better than losing a fight. The losing a fight. The emotional. Yeah. The emotional aspect of it is so devastating to a lot of those guys. Oh Man. Especially with Egos, because look, we all have egos one way or another mostly. But with fighting it's like you're losing in front of that many people and you've got to go back to the drawing board. You know, you're not going to get a title shot now for a couple of fights. You Know Martin was right there, you know? Yeah. Especially in a situation where you don't like the guy and you guys have a lot of emotions invested in the fight and then the guy goes out and chaos. That gets ugly. Well, you can't do that. That's one of the things I teach.

Speaker 1:          00:56:09       You cannot think about that stuff and not get emotionally invested. If you get emotionally invested, you're done. Yeah. That's so important. With a lot of things. It's important with even with art, you know, like you gotta like you gotta be able to let the exist outside of, of you know, any, any of your own bullshit, you know, to let it just, you gotta you can't get wrapped up and this motherfucker's eyeballing me, bitch. You really are. You're going to be the one that shoots first, like all that nonsense can't exist in order for you to perform optimally. It can never grow if you order a few to execute the technique and the best way and to not have all this extra baggage attached to your, your performance. Because when people don't understand is that this is a very important thing your mind, and I know this specifically because I've spent so much time in sensory deprivation tanks, this is a really big, big, big thing in my life, is, uh, the, the ability to separate and get a look at what the fuck is really going on with all of your thoughts and all of your intentions when you're by yourself with no distractions, because if you have any distractions, so it distraction is an unnecessary element to a situation.

Speaker 1:          00:57:25       If there's a situation and there's all this ego attached with you and this guy fighting that did not need to be there, well you've, you've added, you might still beat the guy, but you've added a layer of difficulty to this equation that didn't exist before and you focus resources on it and you only have a certain amount of resources.

Speaker 4:          00:57:42       And guess who created that? You didn't always.

Speaker 1:          00:57:45       The thing about the isolation tank is that you, you really, truly understand when your body is separated from any sensory input, how much resources are going to that? That will also affect consciousness because if you have to deal your, your mind is managing space as you're moving around, like bumping into objects and opening doors and your, your mind is managing all this as well as communicating with people and you don't feel like you're in any way taxed or stressed, but when you're in an environment where there's none of that going on, the sensory deprivation tank being at the same temperatures, your skin, you're floating in there so there's nothing come in into your skin and your skin. You feel like you're flying through the universe. You don't feel anything. You don't see anything. It's pitch black. You know, hearing your ears are underwater so there's nothing coming in and everything seems so clear. It's like there's no distractions there anymore. There's just your thoughts and then you look at it and you're like, yeah, what the fuck am I doing? Like why don't I get out of this relationship? Why don't I stop drinking? Why don't I quit smoking cigarettes? Why do I keep gambling my paycheck away? What the fuck? Inside that environment, those answers seem like so obvious.

Speaker 4:          00:58:52       Yeah. Well, what you just said is as perfect way to put it. There's so much going on in our lives. We don't even take a moment to look inward, you know, we're either driving somewhere or we're eating and talking to somebody or whatever we're doing and then we're sleeping, you know, you never really have that time. So being in the deprivation tank is definitely huge. I've tried it a couple times, actually done in Venice at the float lab up. They just, uh, just that guy's nuts, man. The dude who runs a float lab crash.

Speaker 1:          00:59:16       Yeah. And there's, there's like, there's a community of people all throughout world that create these sensory deprivation tanks and there's some very good models. There's A. I had, um, a Samadhi that was my first one and uh, I, I, I enjoyed that thing very much. I had great experiences in that tank. It's very adequate, but the level of sophistication and technology that this crazy motherfucker puts in to his shit crashes systems are like 100 years in the future. The amount of filtration that's in them, the ozone and nobody. No one else has anywhere near what he's doing. He put in this giant control panel. I had to get it hardwired into the room where the tank is. The whole thing is fucking crazy. It's huge. It's eight feet high and six feet wide and nine feet long. Yeah, I mean it's a gigantic fucking. I mean he, he's.

Speaker 1:          01:00:08       He takes everything to this crazy. So now the newest version of the tanks, they were. The experience is still the same. He just wants to make sure that the water is as pure as it can be. The distractions are minimal. The, there's no light that gets in at all, but when you, when you, when you have this experience on a regular basis, you're really. It makes it puts into perspective why people do certain things where they just keep doing them. I'm a momentum and impulse, like pull into Dunkin donuts or get some fucking dead to horrible fatty foods and stuff your face and you just fill a hole for a second and then you're like, fuck, I'm going to go to the gym tonight. You know? And then you keep repeating this pattern, but note that you're repeating it with actions. That's what's really strange because actions also require resources and when you have an issue, when you have something that's fucking with your mind, a lot of times you will eat up the resources so that you don't have to deal with it because the pressure of dealing with it is scary to you.

Speaker 1:          01:01:02       So you create this sort of artificial situation by actions. That's why meditative time time, whether it's just doing, sitting down and concentrating on your breathing and just trying to clear your mind or actually doing something or even hiking where like a lot of people think hiking is like a meditative sort of a breathing thing because you're, as you're moving all your completely concentrating on that and your life sort of goes away and the stress of it all sort of goes away

Speaker 5:          01:01:29       is living. Yeah, you know it. Do you know how he's like a. He rents them out for hour so he should the mix like massage with flotation tank imagines is laying there and having another girl in a bathing suit just give you like a real time massage while in the flotation tank. Can't that way? The whole thing doesn't really work that way. And when you want to see her you wouldn't want to. You know what if she looks like Gollum when you maybe the one of the things you get to pick. Yeah, I don't think that plus the tank only 11 inches deep. Like she can't really do that. You would design it so like your, your, you can breathe in another planet where gravity gravity's definitely make no. Just one answer. You can breathe underwater. It's like it's a ramp like where it goes up so your. It wouldn't work to see if that's silly because if it's a ramp

Speaker 3:          01:02:20       you would be sloshing around in there. The woman. That would ruin the whole idea of a sensory deprivation.

Speaker 5:          01:02:26       Yeah. Unless you're laying on like some like fleshlight material all the way in it. Like the whole thing's flashlight inside. Like why don't they make us feel good in your Dick? But it wouldn't feel so good on your face. You'd be like, what the fuck is this rubbery thing on my face? Fleshlight blankets you. It feels good in your deck because your Dick is so crazy at Dick's willing to go into assholes readily. One of the girls like put it in my ass. You know your Dixon idiot. Your Dick is essentially

Speaker 3:          01:02:51       being shit. Walls all over itself. Your Dick is a fool. There's a big difference between that and what you're willing to do with your face. Like most people, most respectful people and not rub a shit wall, a wall where all the shit passes by. He wouldn't take a rub it all over your skin, but your Dick is like,

Speaker 5:          01:03:08       oh yeah, love it baby. For Christmas I got dolphin, a vib dolphin encounter. I get to swim with the dolphins and hugged the dolphins and I know like I'm planning it out already where I'm going to put my head against a dolphin. Just be like, fuck me right now. Fuck me and see if he can read my mind. Like, what? Have you done that yet? What are you talking about them? We'd done it yet. No, I haven't done that. Swim with the dolphins at Avi. Tried like any, like hacking to the doctor, talking to the dolphins. Do you have a broken brain? Like you know what Mckenna like sat there and fucking took acid with. When would you try any mini experiments? It was first of all, as John Lilly Lilly today. What's going on? Did you smoke through? I've been sick for three days. I was sick, you know, for Christmas and the day before.

Speaker 5:          01:03:50       Thank you. Still sick, go back to the doctor, tell them to focus on your brain. Now this what you just said, listen to what? Like a rational person having a conversation. You're like, you don't go to the dolphins. You fuck the shit out of you right now. People know. What are you saying? Like when you first hung out with a dog or when you hang out with dogs, you know, you always sit there and like you read my mind and I know every experiment with your cats. Never do anything. I don't pretend to be doing anything. Okay. Let's, let's be clear. You pretending that your dog might be able to see you and we'll talk to you. Look at Dr doolittle movie. I'm not, I'm not. I don't pretend I don't sit around and go. Can I read your mind? No. I don't know why, because I read a lot of books on dogs and humans and not once does it ever say anywhere that they can read your fucking mind.

Speaker 5:          01:04:34       So I assume that they can't read your mind and then when I watched like zookeeper that that's just bullshit. All right. Okay. That's. No, I don't sit around and go, fuck me, Mr Dolphin. No, I don't, I don't do that. So you tell me if you had a dolphin in an aquarium tank inside your bedroom and everyday he looked at that. Oh, it asks you where it would want to live and I wouldn't let it go. Like if it was a crippled often it couldn't move. I just sat there and had to stare and look at it and shoot it in the head and we'll make the next life will come back as a tuna to they sell retarded dolphins for pets. That'd be awesome. Like you could keep it in an aquarium because it doesn't want to move. It just wants to sit there and drool. But it'd be so cool to be alive and it would still want to eat and like just having a retarded dolphin in your bedroom. That'd be perfect if you were into that, but I suspect you get bored because he'd probably be really stupid like the middle of

Speaker 1:          01:05:18       the night. He'd be like a crying out for you. He'd be like, Oh my God. You know how bad dolphin street sound at 3:00 in the morning when you're hung over, but what if it says happy noises? No, it's a relaxing, but you're just hoping for a different type of Down's syndrome animal. You're not hoping for like a normal down's syndrome animals or an animal with a disease for you. It's like, well, it's a magical down central animal that's happy all the time.

Speaker 5:          01:05:42       Well, if we can clone them, if they're 13 cloning now animal cloning, so maybe you can clone your dog. It should be all right to close a retarded dolphin that you keep an aquarium that doesn't squeak.

Speaker 1:          01:05:50       You know what? We're really lucky. We're really lucky that people can't get other animals pregnant. Okay. We're really lucky because if, if that was the case, there would be people. Everything out there. There would be people, giraffes, you would go, how the fuck did this happen? It would happen. Would they get driver's license? If you could fuck up an animal and get it pregnant for sure. There will be human animal hybrid all over the world of everything, of gorillas you would it to go. How the fuck did this happen? Some dude, fuck does zebra roped it? Held it down. Shot. Not only that when it was operating, shot a load into it cam and not just fucked it but came. Okay. That's a big deal. I mean we were talking about before the show, like when you know you've been dating a girl for a long time.

Speaker 1:          01:06:35       Like if you're bored with sex, like if you're not sexually compatible, you can get in those situations where you, you don't even really want to have sex with them anymore. We were talking about like when you're pretending you're fucking somebody else, like why your belly close your eyes. Like oh yeah. Thinking about some chick that used to be like, that's ridiculous. You're getting actual real sex, but you're pretending to get sex from a different person because that's the only way you're going gonna get off. Well this guy, fuck zebra bitch. Okay. Z. He didn't have to pretend you have to. You know it's a zebra. There's shit all over its ass and that's right next to your deck because zebras don't wipe their ass ever. They just dump out these gigantic jungle shits and then you got to hold that motherfucker down and bone it and get it pregnant, but they would exist.

Speaker 1:          01:07:19       There would be dudes in Africa that were half zebra. They would look just like the Navi and then fucking avatar movie. There would be giant Zebra people. There's no doubt about it, man. That would be exactly the right height too. It'd be like a nine foot tall sort of human zebra hybrid. They would. The whole planet would be half people have fish people fucking fish for sure. To to fuck fish. I and a hundred percent. I know I have no doubt about it. There would be dogs would be ridiculous. Okay. Dogs would be like. It would be like that. The movie district nine, when those aliens came down and you know, they had a fucking figure out what to do with them. That would be the human dog population because it will be so many human dogs. There would be like, don't fuck your dogs. They'd be like big billboards with a deck and a dog and a big red line through it. Don't fuck your dogs because people would fucked her dogs. They would definitely fuck the dogs. People have fucked parrots. I guarantee you, if a person can get a pair of pregnant, there'll be people, parent hybrids, and it will be

Speaker 3:          01:08:16       flying around our cities all day snatching purses and throwing shit at people shitting on you. Yeah, for sure. If people could make hybrids with parents, those motherfuckers would be like prisoners flying in the sky, dropping rocks on people's heads, killing the Mashiah. I guarantee you there'd be a person pigeon. You would look at it and go, how the fuck did that even happen? But there'll be a half person, half pigeon, like a foot and a half tall, all fucking pissed off and fucked up. Feet fucked up. Pigeon feet and shit. If people could get everything pregnant, we would get everything pregnant. There would be people, trees. They'd be people, melons and pumpkins there. There'll be people like Lord of the rings just describing Lord of the rings. But what of your loads got duplicated? Everything. If it wasn't just human being and be like Mac book pro, come over here and sit on daddy's lap.

Speaker 3:          01:09:03       Sperm just reproduced everything and saw, just shoot sperm on a water bottle. It makes another waterfall right next to it, like one of those pods and that movie invasion of the body snatchers is grown under the bed. Trying to become what it's, you know, I'd find a time machine. I would suck my own dick and fuck my mouth and get my own pregnant. Now it would just spin in a circle, like a cart wheel going down the street and be two mirrors looking into each other. Forever. Never end. It'd be two mirrors facing each other to oblivion of you. Boeing yourself in a spinning circle like you're in one of those cartoon wheels going down the hill like one guy holding another guy's foot or a dog biting it's tail a dog. Biting it's tail is the perfect analogy is rolling down the hill. There will be you sucking your own Dick and fucking yourself in the ass.

Speaker 3:          01:09:46       And a giant circle, a spiral spiral. Fractal had a marine we could roll up. What's his face goes on and billions and billions of light years. That's like a huge swirling galaxy. Have a zillion trillion Brian sucking their own dick and calling themselves in the ass and a giant circle of impossible reality. Imagine. Hey, that's not any more impossible to believe than a galaxy itself. No, there's no way a guy can be, suck his own dick and fucking himself in the ass flying around a star, but shoes, gigantic balls of gas and slash or water and slash or rock that kind of makes sense with molten centers shooting live out of their tents. Yeah. Okay. That makes. Yeah, that makes more sense than a dude flying around sucking his own dick of boning himself in the ass. No, that makes just as much sense. It's just as ridiculous.

Speaker 3:          01:10:36       A whole universe filled with a spiral of Brian's a trillion light years long. All bone in them is less than half as spectacular as a real supernova. So I'm really impressed. I'm not impressed by your performance. I'm going to totally do what your, uh, your friend does with the stripper pants. I'm ready. Shave like down, like my swim trunks down to have a really thin layer and then when it often comes up to me, I'm just going to see again, you don't make sense. What I said makes sense. What you're saying is crazy. No, I go, fuck a dolphin, son. Dude. I'm just going to put my body right. They're not going to let you. They're

Speaker 1:          01:11:14       going to see what you're doing. They're gonna arrest you. Do you think the guy, they're going to be a fucking website dedicated just like they have sex criminal websites. They're going to have guys who were even thinking about fucking dolphins. It's sad enough. These poor dolphins are kept in these cages. They wished they were out in the ocean chasing fish, having a good time with each other. Know that we have to contain them in some shitty little spot and not even let them kill their own fish, which is part of the big thrill of life and some asshole thinks it's cute to try to. Fuck you.

Speaker 2:          01:11:41       Yeah, Joe, but I just found out their nipples are inside. They're assholes. Did you know that's like the babies feed by putting their nose up that dolphins dick and it's like fucking shoots milk its ass. And so like imagine this. Imagine having the best upgrade to a butthole ever having nipples and sign now you're.

Speaker 1:          01:11:57       No, you're doing materials. You can't do that. I saw you do it on stage where our dolphins nipples in the ass hole.

Speaker 2:          01:12:06       You're probably like, what the fuck? I'm just enjoying the ride, man.

Speaker 1:          01:12:10       They're hidden side slits of the mother's underbelly. See you got to read Bible books. There's no, no. How does the dolphin feed? They had a baby dog. These, um, they don't feed other butthole dude. No they don't.

Speaker 2:          01:12:28       I know that. I did the [inaudible] experience at Atlantis last year and they don't even want you to pet them around their blow holes. So you better be

Speaker 1:          01:12:34       careful. Really?

Speaker 2:          01:12:36       Yeah. They get upset. Oh, I'm not gonna touch the blowhole why? Why, why? To take the bullet point when you have the real thing.

Speaker 1:          01:12:43       No. Brian has slits in the underbelly of the mother and she releases these nipples. She then the dolphins nurse. That way you don't know what you're talking about, man. That's you're talking crazy. Somebody said that to me. Must have been. Yeah. Well that person is probably Sam Tripoli. He probably sent you off the skids that. That's so dumb. You can. All you gotta do is just Google that. I saw you talking about that on stage. I was like, no, they aren't. I know they're not that. I would have known

Speaker 2:          01:13:10       they actually brought me to like a science page or something like I have it on my twitter link.

Speaker 1:          01:13:14       Okay. It's not real son. Look, there's a picture of a dolphin, a female dolphin nursing. Look, look at that. See? I think it can nurse two different ways. Can't do it through the asshole. That's not healthy. It's not a dolphin upgrade. You just trying to say that joke. How dare you. Oh, I wonder if this is true. No, it's not true. Brian. Don't wonder Jesus Christ. Guys like you are walking here

Speaker 2:          01:13:41       located in his anus. The cast sticks. It's built into the whole of the baby nurses from its mother through. You're on the onion.com.

Speaker 1:          01:13:49       Okay. Stop it. No, they don't. They can't. You would know that it was on. What the fuck? Facts dot commerce. I think those things. A lot of times people just make that shit up. I really don't think you can. Oh Shit.

Speaker 1:          01:14:04       I just don't think that you would, you. First of all, that wouldn't be natural. It doesn't make any sense that you would want to be feeding near fecal matter. Why would nature ever set that up? Yeah. You're going to eat right near where your mom shits. Are you cool with that? Otherwise you die, right? No, no. And everywhere it says they have nipples in these slits hidden inside the small underbelly. Uh, under the, uh, no question. Yeah. Every website that I'm looking at. So it's the same thing. They have these nipples that are hidden in a slit in the underbelly,

Speaker 7:          01:14:34       fake dolphin nursing facts going on the Internet. Everyone's fucking. They want to find out how people are.

Speaker 1:          01:14:42       They want to find out how dumb people are and whether or not people will google things. It's probably an experiment and you probably just led to this disinformation campaign because you've been talking about it onstage for several weeks now

Speaker 7:          01:14:52       without ever even once without ever saying the exact opposite, but I believe you because I'm also seeing more on what you're saying. Then

Speaker 1:          01:15:02       the websites that are saying that you can, they, they are in their ass like uber facts. Who's writing Uberflip? Dolphin Reef Dot Com. Anybody can contribute to these things and sneak them in. There's a, there's a lot of these little silly twitter pages and websites and where they make things up on person. I've read a bunch of them like, oh my God, what the fuck in your ass facts. You know, there's a lot of those that are not really facts. They're just trying to get retweets and they'll say something crazy. They get retweets and then they'll like tweet out. We're giving away a free ipad. You know what I mean? Like they get, there's, there's a, there's a bunch of people that have businesses that are set up just around like getting people to their websites and getting people to know. So don't make shit up.

Speaker 7:          01:15:47       Sorry, I didn't think people would lie about dolphins. Seriously. You know, I think people would lie about them, but you did think that you would like to sneak up behind one and asked one if you could just touching, rubbing it, rubbing around the outside type. Shit. You know, I just think it'd be feel good. So let's have you touched a dolphin. I have not even touched the it. It's like raping a prisoner that you can't understand. This was like he's crying and you're like, you liked it. Meanwhile in his language he's screaming out, please stop fucking me. That's what it'd be like if you had sex with adults. Like if I touched a dolphin, does it feel like your cheek? It's like plastic. It's like plastic, so it doesn't look hard. Plus it feels like a dildo. Yeah. No, I really felt that Dildo. Wetsuit.

Speaker 7:          01:16:21       Maybe your wetsuit. You've never felt the deal. Never ever lived. I never lived. I'll try it later. I guess. Clearly touched the tilt down. Have you ever seen one over a chick's house? I'm actually only 12 years old. Oh fuck. He's got that crazy disease. Yeah. Dylan. Those nobody's impressed with the way they feel. I mean, you know, I mean it gets kind of close to like what a Dick would feel like, but you'd know the difference if I put a dick in your hand and then I put a Dildo in your hand, like which one is the real dick? You know, you feel electricity right through riddick. Totally feel it. Have you ever sparked but your deck, I wonder if it could cause your blendtec blender to catch fire. I just throw it in there and find out all this show's gone off the in,

Speaker 3:          01:17:10       into the wounds to de de, de, de, de Doo. I'm back to positive thinking, man. Today to say, les miserables, you gotta learn how to talk English so the people understand you. I don't even know what you said.

Speaker 5:          01:17:23       I'm sorry. I'm eating one of these on it. Buffalo bars don't talk at the same time. Fuck. Did you see the Quentin Tarantino movie?

Speaker 3:          01:17:31       No. No, but uh,

Speaker 5:          01:17:34       was it good? Jamie said, it's fucking awesome. Jamie says, awesome. It looks amazing. I can't wait to see it. Yeah, it looks pretty bad. Attention. Quintin Tarantino is a bad motherfucker. He makes the kind of movies that people want to see, like fun, crazy movies where nutty shit goes down. Did you see the hot end up seeing the hobbit? Yes, I saw them. Did you like it was at Dick's house. What time did you fall asleep? And I grew up in our, in our, in my wife nuts, me. She goes, you're not asleep. I go, nope, I was totally asleep. You've got to get your points up. I guess that's a new game that you get your points and like how fast she can fall asleep in the hobbit and 18 seconds. I couldn't have to sleep about a half an hour. And you know, the problem with all those movies is.

Speaker 3:          01:18:14       I hate saying this because I even make fun of people say that. First of all, I read the books and I read them when I was a little kid and they were like a part of me growing up, you know, some watching it and I know that certain shit has to happen. So you already like it. That takes away from a lot of the drama of the movie because you know all these things going to happen. It's like, okay, well how are they going to happen as opposed to, you know, a great film that's entirely original. So this movie is an adaptation of the novel that you've already read. So there's that and then there's that. There's so much to tell that it takes a long ass time to tell it all and it's just not as enjoyable when you're watching it in the film forum.

Speaker 3:          01:18:48       Then if you're watching it in a movie. So there's all this shit that happened that it's just like, yeah, it looks really cool, but it's just some shit happening. Like the scene of they're fighting the ogres and I'm like, spoiler, spoiler alert. They fight Ogres, but after awhile I'm like, oh, I get it. They're going to be fine and let's just watch them. Cartoon initially have this fight that has no drama attached to it at all and it there was, there was a lot of that, but the special effects are fucking stunning. What they can do now is fucking stunning.

Speaker 5:          01:19:19       What frame rate did you see that? Do you see the creepy one? I thought, yeah, the high frame rate. Three d was and people that were complaining about that, go, fuck yourself. Go Fuck Yourself. Are you really complaining? Like that fake version of the TV. They were like, this is gonna ruin films forever. It gives the entire film with creepy. To me, it's a fantasy movie. You fuck stick suspension of disbelief. Isn't that the point? Well, not only that, this is the most suspension of disbelief. He movie of all time. It's a whole fucking you're following to do with giant, furry feet and a wizard. Okay. Jesus Christ. Are you really saying it doesn't look real? You asshole. It's not supposed to look real stupid. Fuck face. It's supposed to be fun and it's way more fun when it's in that high frame rate. Three d verse. It's bad ass, man. When I was at my friend's

Speaker 2:          01:20:08       house for Christmas, uh, her brother was playing call of duty in three D and I put it on the glasses. I was like,

Speaker 3:          01:20:14       Holy Shit. Yeah. Those three d tvs, those are nuts. We had a three d laptop that alienware gave us, but we never played a game and it on it

Speaker 2:          01:20:22       play play portal to how was it sweet. But I mean I also have three d TVs I've been playing call of duty and three days ago who gives a shit

Speaker 3:          01:20:30       man? Um, the, the, the technology for those things has gotten really, really powerful. I, I saw a three d television recently at one of those. What are those? Uh, those high end fucking stores. That's a audio visual store. Yeah. I forget what it was, but we were on the road and we walked into one of these retail stores and they had this crazy fucking setup where it's really thin glass and that was essentially the entire TV. It was, it was really weird. And you put these glasses on it. What did we watch? Monster's inc. Is that what it was? Yeah. Monsters Inc and three d. And it's just like, it's such an overwhelming experience, like there's so much more visual input coming your way and like this added dimension of it, if they could just get it down like that, like the perfect way. But like really bad at like avatar. Avatar I think was way better because of the three days.

Speaker 2:          01:21:25       Yeah. Avatar just came out on three day. By the way, if you have a three d tv, it just finally came out so everyone can buy. It used to be where you only could buy it if he bought this $150.

Speaker 3:          01:21:33       See I feel like if you wear glasses in your house, you might be an asshole.

Speaker 2:          01:21:36       Oh, did I love it man. I got these new ones off amazon. They're just generic for like 20 bucks. They just charge it by usb. So you always have them charged. You just put on. It's like putting on sunglasses. But while you're laying in bed, do you think one day we'll look

Speaker 3:          01:21:46       back in the day when we'll laugh about the days when they used to have to wear glasses to greedy fucks, but it'll be like, it's ancient data technology. I mean essentially we're trying to distort an image. If you take your glasses off and you watched the hobbit, it's craziness. It's like it's very rarely see what the fuck's happening. It's gross, but then he put the glasses on. So somehow or another they need this distortion and the pastor. Just a simple lens, just a little simple lens that's really close to your eyes in order to make it happen. I don't accept that. I said nonsense, so that I think until now, not much these crazy fucks in the hadron collider people, they're doing some things, but they're going to be able to figure out three d, three d is going to be. I think eventually it's going to be. Everyone's going to have instead of a television, you just gonna have like one of those help me, obi one. You're my only hope. One of those little things that she stuck on, r two, d two and they're going to sit that bitch down and step back and it's going to make a show for you right in front of.

Speaker 2:          01:22:36       Yeah, and it's everyone's gonna be doing it everywhere too. You're going to be like in the parking lot, there's going to be like average people are gonna throw advertisements in front of you and your fucking thing out of here. You know, I don't want to see this hologram thing.

Speaker 3:          01:22:46       Yeah. You're going to be walking down the street and you're going to watch, like see through. People have sword fights right in front of you. It can be. Is that a real person to post? Is that a hologram? Hologram, right. It's going to be totallY pokemon shit. Big fucking dude can add each other with swords. Right in the Middle of a fucking intersection. People driving right through them putting me like ufc fights

Speaker 5:          01:23:06       on the, on the, on the road. Just tryIng. Yeah. Yeah. Right. Where you people trying to walk through head kicking each other, like escort guys like in vegas where they're like flipping the tickets now they're just gonna be like interrupting your fights with like the girls like fucking giving blow jobs to other guys.

Speaker 1:          01:23:21       Yeah. Trainees. Yeah. It's going to be all over the street. You're going to watch tranny sex coming out of the ground. People going to outlaw that and then they go, this is. I'm trying to walk on my kid to school. Fucking looking at trainees banging each other. Right? They're alive

Speaker 5:          01:23:34       with the censorship be there'll be like a smoke that you throw on the ground that like blocks the hologram or something makes

Speaker 1:          01:23:39       me wonder like is there like the internet is the only place that we've ever had in our whole life where there's no censorship. The internet is just, it's the wild west and it's free. How much you like to spend on the internet? A lot. A lot. Most people are on the internet for at least an hour a day. You know? More. So if you get a chance to be in front of a computer at work and you don't have a lot of shit to do, a lot of people are online all the fucking time. How much different is that than real life? And imagine if real life had no censorship at all, either in real life, you could buy all the drugs you want to get a gun whenever you want it to get a car, wherever you. Even when you do everything that you could do online you could do in real life with no, no restrictions whatsoever.

Speaker 1:          01:24:22       How many districts, what you wonder, how much regulation do we actually need and how much could just exist under common sense. I mean would, could you allow someone to really stockpile a fucking huge ammo dump and you know, have a, a, an armory of vehicles and tanks and shit and like, oh man, you gotta stop doing that. Or you know what? You have to knock on their door and go, what are you, what are you doing over here? Why do you have an, a, b, one bomber? The fuck's going on. You got to stealth fighter plane in your backyard, bitch. What are you planning on doing? Man? I live right down the street. Yeah. Nice to meet you. Yeah. Our kids go to school together I think. Yeah. Okay, cool. You are you an army? What's what's happening here? Should you know? Should there be any restrictions whatsoever?

Speaker 1:          01:25:03       And if there weren't, if you look at the way people have sort of learned how to express themselves on the internet. I think the internet went through a real bad time and now I think it's slowly starting to like level out where people are less and less tolerant of assholes. Less and less tolerant of trolls. Less and less. That dude that got busted, that was like on reddit, you know about that story with a guy who's doing a lot of creepy shit online like because that's what got them off like posts and fucked up pictures and saying fucked up things about things and these people found out who he was in real life and they contacted his employer and he got fired for operating under a pseudonym online under a completely different name than his own. Not representing their company in any way, shape or form, but because they established that it was him, they went after him and decided that his actions and the way he was behaving outside during his own free time, they could fire him for that regardless of how well he performed at work, which is really weird, but it also sends a message that sends a message.

Speaker 1:          01:26:03       Well, no, we're more concerned with humanity than we are with this idea that you have these irrefutable rights. Like yes, you have irrefutable rights, but if you're posting pictures of dead kids online, you might. You might be a piece of shit and I might not want you to have anything to do with my life and just because we worked together like I should be able to remove that. I should be able to stop that. So in that sense I think, I think it's sort of the anonymity is slowly slipping away. Yeah. But for people that have never been anonymous like me or brian, I think it's, it's, it's, you're better off that way. You're better off everybody. It would be better off for everybody if we all figured out how to treat each other a lot better online and be chill and I think people because there was no repercussions for a long time, they just, they had an experience that they shouldn't have had.

Speaker 1:          01:26:58       They had the ability to affect someone with nothing coming back your way is the no, no social repercussions and that's like not normal for humans. You can't do that in real life. Right? Why should you be able to do it online? Well, we're not a setup for it and I think this is a total. It's such a totally new experience that I think human beings are culture and I think all cultures in general went into this completely ignorant to the repercussions of it to completely ignorant to how it was going to operate and what the effects of human beings and human instincts are going to be when confronted with this completely non human scenario. The ability to communicate with people who don't know who you are and not just communicate like you yell something out from that from a hill, but write detailed shit about them.

Speaker 1:          01:27:45       You know, and send some mean angry letter to them and that you could do that and this burst and had not have anything come back to you. And because of that, because people have this unique ability to reach people like that, it presented this thing that hadn't been resolved yet in, in the human body and in the human culture in like, you know, are our ways of resolving conflicts for one on one. I've been pretty clearly established. You know, the way people shouldn't, shouldn't treat each other. It's in the bible, you know, but you know, love your brother and all that shit. It's like, it's all like the idea is, look, this is the best way to operate a world. We have to figure out how to resolve these conflicts. When they're done, they appear. Well, these conflicts had never appeared before. They literally didn't exist in our generation.

Speaker 1:          01:28:25       And that's something that is escaping a lot of people. A lot of people are not. They haven't really truly wrapped their heads on the insanity that is the internet and what it's done to human culture. But I think we've, we've sort of wobbled it and I've got a way better handle on it now and I think that you see way less and less douchey shit way westland, less people that will just want to be assholes. It's less like, I think if you could see like statistics on internet trolling and douchebags on twitter and stuff like that. I think it's slowly tapered off. I really do. I don't think it's just for me, I think it's always going to be a good supply always. You know, just like there's always going to be monkeys throw shit at other. There's always.

Speaker 7:          01:29:03       But I think it's better. I've even had people online on poker like talk crap to me and say how they're gonna mess me up in vegas and then I see him at the table and they're like, hey, I'm so and so, like they're trying to be all nice to me and I'm just like, wait a second, you just, you know, you were talking to shit to me online now you're trying to be my friend. What's going on? You confront them. I don't, but I should. poker players are like, um, it's a weird way to make a living man lot. I've met a lot of poker players and first of all they're all like really intense dudes. Everyone is like an intense and like, like they're all, they're all very focused, you know, like when you're having conversations with them and there's no dumb professional poker players because it doesn't seem like he can really pull that off. Are there that I don't know aBout well, dumb how colleges like a showing or intelligence in general,

Speaker 1:          01:29:51       there's a big difference in my opinion, between intelligence and education. I've met a lot of people that are really educated but stupid as fuck. He just repeats shit and you're like, wait a minute, you're not getting the connection to. Right. That doesn't fucking work. And they, they, there's no thinking on their own. It's repeating shit. But then there's a lot of people that have like bArely a high school diploma and they're sharp as fuck.

Speaker 7:          01:30:09       Well, you know, it's interesting you just said that there was a kid online that didn't graduate high school yet. He made millions of dollars playing poker. Quinn tarantino didn't graduate high school. Yeah, mostly we were just talking about the django. There you go. Drop days. Your god. A lot of people will not. I mean there's a lot of success people that I know even just didn't finish. I mean I

Speaker 1:          01:30:26       out of college with one semester to go, oh, I didn't finish college. I did three years at umass boston and maybe the only reason I did it was because I didn't want people thinking I was a loser. I didn't even come close to grAduating. I had a lot of shit that I like. If I wanted to. Like first of all it's taken like elective courses. I was taking whatever courses I wanted to because it was on like a, they have a thing, like they had like different programs for people that had jobs, you know, I forget what they call adult education or secondary education wherever. Yeah. Because I took a year off and then I started doing this and I was barely paying attention. That was barely, you know, I've learned way more through documentaries than I did for those three years of showing up at this building. To wonder what the fuck I'm doing with my life.

Speaker 7:          01:31:05       I was just talking about this the other day. I was like, I was like, our college is necessary anymore. I mean, you could take your iphone and figure out everything you need to figure out about, you know, french or spanish or anything you want to learn. You can do it online. What's

Speaker 1:          01:31:16       dope about college is the college gives you an opportunity to be excited by new and different people and new points of view. And I missed that. I missed that. That aspect of uh, of college. The social aspect. Yeah. I couldn't go Anywhere. I was, I was. Well I could, but when I had graduated high school, so my competitive taekwondo dance, so from 18 through 21, it was like my most competitive days when I was completely dedicated to it. And the idea of me going somewhere else to go to school was like, there's no way I couldn't. I had a really good instructor and a really good team. I was like, I'm not going anywhere. I'm not, I'm not going to move somewhere and go to school for what I mean, I don't even know what the fuck I want to do. I had no aspirations whatsoever, but I got so tired everybody telling me, you know, you're, what are you doing?

Speaker 1:          01:31:59       Uh, you know, for awhile I would say I was training for the olympics because I was trying to make the us olympic taekwondo team. And then, uh, I gave up on saying that, but when I started kickboxing I started getting beat up and I was like, oh man, I'm talking window. Have some fucking holes in it, man. So then that stopped wanting to do that. But the idea that, um, I was just trying to find some other path in life and figure out what I wanted to do, like is terrifying to say to someone because all I heard out of my own mouth was, well, I'm a fucking loser and I'm always going to be a loser. I'm never going to figure it out. I'm never going to be able to take care of myself. That's all I thought of when I said it. But today, shit man, you could learn it least as much online as you could in a school most likely more because you're going to have way more access to information than just the few books this one guy subscribes to you.

Speaker 1:          01:32:49       It's Basically just someone reading out of a book to you is what it is, but not only that, you can do it all day, every day, wherever you are. The crazy thing about online, especially if you got a big phone, one of those tablets, phones or something like that. Yeah, you could fucking read like websites and books. You could do it all day long. You can. You have, as long as you have a signal that can come to you, you have access to like pretty much every question that's ever been asked the if not the answer, a slew of different competing answers that you might not even get. Especially if you go to like brigham young university and get one opinion, you're up with the mormon. I'm saying you got to be careful. That's got to be fucking the most devastating thing for like religions. The access to information.

Speaker 1:          01:33:30       The more people are finding out like, well I remember when I was a catholic, right? And we had friends that were jewish because um, you know, you live in New York. When I was a little kid it was living in New Jersey, like the, that area, the east coast is filled with jewish people, but I didn't understand what the jew, what a job. I didn't even understand what it meant. I would just hear someone say, oh, is he jewish? Yeah, he's mr feinstein and his wife of blah blah blah blah. I didn't know what that meant. And then one day when I was in catholic school, somebody they were talking about like different religions and judaism got brought up and someone said the, like the preset something about the, uh, the jewish religion. I was like, the jewish went to, that's judaism and get another. What is that?

Speaker 1:          01:34:13       It's, we're judeo christian. And I was like, whoa, whoa, whoa, what? Wait a minute, wait a minute. It's more than one version of the story, like, are you fucking shitting me? Just that, just them telling me about competing versions of the story. If I could have gotten online when I was six and googled his religion bullshit, just gone through every fucking piece of information, which by the way, when you're six, you could fucking read kinda, you know, you could probably actually do this and you could figure out if you could ask like, dad, what does collaborate mean? You know, you like there's a few of those you'd have to throw out there, but basically you could get a pretty good idea of why you shouldn't pay attention to these crazy fox because every one of their story they swear by and every one of the stories is different than everybody else's fucking store. Someone's got to be wrong.

Speaker 7:          01:34:58       You know, It's funny, my friend stephanie, she posted on her facebook the other day, a picture of two people with reading bibles, different beliefs. And it said, oh, yours is fulfilled with bs too. And uh, she got someone from Saudi Arabia that just went nuts on her for just defendant is beliefs blindly?

Speaker 8:          01:35:19       No, I used to do a whole

Speaker 7:          01:35:22       bit about how, um, the israelis and palestinians or the arabs and the israelis are constantly at war. But they look so similar to each other, you know, and that was because they were sneaking over and getting forbidden sex and they would have an angry like angry opposing religion, sex. Like you believe the crazy shit

Speaker 8:          01:35:41       crazy shit. Did you see that episode of curb your enthusiasm? Where Larry David,

Speaker 7:          01:35:46       it takes back. I'm a palestinian lady

Speaker 8:          01:35:50       from a chicken joint that he's not. Well, he's swimming. He's single now. Larry. David? Yeah. The enthusiasm in the show. In the show. Yeah. Yeah. Divorced friends kind of friends are trying to get back to you. So now he gets new checks. He's sitting there and stirred. Can I swear on this? Oh fuck you. Are you serious? She's saying she's saying she's saying fuck me jus when she's, when she's sitting on top of it. So yeah. Well that's sort of

Speaker 7:          01:36:22       old. A bit like a who used to do that. There's a black guy that used to do about how like dating a white girl and making her say fuck me with your big nigger cock.

Speaker 8:          01:36:33       Yeah. And then sam aaa says that every other podcasts, if sam do that too, like every podcast, what does he like to say that he likes to say that word

Speaker 7:          01:36:40       being edgy. Um, yeah. That, that idea of the opposing getting it off spit that's existed for a long time and attention for fruits. The black girl in a white neighborhood. Oh yeah. We're, we're Silly bitches highway when It comes to forbidden fruit. Know we want, we can have what do you do? Anything to tell the fighters how to concentrate on their diet when like trying to, like I said, just let it in. But as far as like not thinking negative things because a lot of times like that's all they think about. It's like, fuck, I wish I could eat. Fuck, I wish I could eat. No, I haven't actually dealt with that yet. No, it's never come up. I think that would be something like, I don't know, mike dolce is uh, one of the best guys at, uh, getting guys to make weight. And he's also like, he's got a good mindset for like coaching good mindset for like not bullshitting with you.

Speaker 7:          01:37:34       And straighten up and he gets them to the sled. Compli, we're eating healthy foods. You're not killing yourself. If your body's fine. And I'm like, yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine. You know he can fucking tick tock tick tock. But if you go on one of those spirals, it's like any other spiral. If you get it onto that. Fuck, I wish I could eat fire up spiral. Fuck. I wish I could do this. I wish you could have a cigarette. Fuck, I wish I could have a cigarette. And the moment you do that, you're yourself down that path.

Speaker 3:          01:37:56       I seen people like this motherfucker. He started smoking cigarettes again because there's cat hurt its foot. Stop. And think about that. He was looking for an excuse. so much fucking cats for what I do, man. Fucking cats live. This is crazy.

Speaker 5:          01:38:10       It wasn't because Of that, that cat in the bathroom with a litter box come back in a couple of days. it was a ton of shit. And that was the thIng that snapped the big bowl of food. A fresh litter box locker in the kitchen. Go to palm springs for the weekend. Go somewhere

Speaker 3:          01:38:25       with that tap, figure this shit out. Let it do what it would do if went to the emergency room out there in the wild. Oh, it doesn't exist. Oh, well I guess the cats, you're not supposed to fix them.

Speaker 5:          01:38:35       Does your for no reason to middle night. Like a foreign morning to start going. Well what the fuck is that? Shit. They're calling some updates. They call out. You get bored.

Speaker 3:          01:38:44       They do it at night sometimes, but my boy doesn't do that. The boys really quiet. He's a boy. Doesn't really do that. But the girl, she's first of all, my girl cuts. Super flick and needy man. And so she'd be like, anytime I'm near you met. She's like that like anytime you're near. And she only does that to me because my wife, my wife is allergic to cats so she can't be like fucking with this cat. So the cat gets most of the affection from me. So when I'm around. So

Speaker 5:          01:39:12       bill the night, you just hear here, now

Speaker 3:          01:39:18       I got to open the door and go, shut the fuck up. Jesus. You need a bitch as a father clock. They don't even seem to understand as well.

Speaker 5:          01:39:26       Wow. Wow.

Speaker 3:          01:39:30       And she's not horny. She's 16 years old and she's fixed. Okay. So that's not the issue. She's just been a ed bitch.

Speaker 3:          01:39:41       mostly what? I'm fucking bored. You don't have any mIce in this house. It's funny watching babies crush ants. They don't give a fuck about ants that are yucky killed death. My little two year old, just crushing ants and then it goes like this with a little bodies just flicks her finger and they're out of her consciousness. Like she would never do that with a mouse. Like you couldn't stump a mouse and just like kick his body into a corner somewhere. He'd be like, oh look at this mess. You got to clean up. But there's a certain level of dead body where we just tolerate it laying around and that's ants. He can't do it with a roach. You got clean up. Your big, the disgusting. Now fly. You got to pick up. Unless you're A dude, if you're a dude, you're watching tv and swat a fly like, oh yeah, I got them.

Speaker 3:          01:40:30       Fuck them. Like on a table. You might like might get up during the commercial, wipe it off, you just flick it and forget it, but like a roach that's big enough where you got to care or when you get to like mice and shit like that. Anything that's got hair, you can't just kill it. Caterpillar clean it up. What does that. Why do we. I mean we have obviously have a detachment based on the fact that it's out of sight, out of mind thing. Little tiny ant and you crush it, but the other thing is it's like there's so many of them. It's hard to give a fuck about them. It's true. There's so many ants that the mass of the weight of ants on earth is about the same as the weight of humans.

Speaker 3:          01:41:09       Yeah. Google that. Google that. That's real. I'm not making that up. Sleep tonight. Yeah, of course. It's an estimation because we. I haven't been asked to be on any scale. Have you? I mean they're really counting this. Is there a census where you have to fucking show up somewhere and count or did the girls get to mail in their own way? Because then we start adding pounds all over the fucking place because no one's honest, right? You don't have those boner pills from my aunts. They're made from an supposedly those boner pills. Like what are they called again?

Speaker 2:          01:41:38       Hot rod. Six thousand or 5,000 hot rod. 5,000. But supposedly there's ants in them that, you know, the extract ants. And I'm thinking, wow. So that means there's somebody and it's like an ant farmer that has distract the ants and instead, look, you buy this little bump. You're making bone or your

Speaker 3:          01:41:55       stop. First of all, stop. You got to. Before we started talking about this online google and find out if they actually make this shit, right?

Speaker 2:          01:42:02       Yeah, it does. I mean, why would I, why would I read a bottle and be like, oh, I guess it's a.

Speaker 3:          01:42:07       Why would you read that? A dolphin as nipples inside. It's because I can show you five websites that say that. No, no, no. You can show me one website that has one article and they all copied it and put it on their website. I looked. It's the same exact story verbatim. Okay,

Speaker 2:          01:42:20       well this is on the actual bottle, so unless they just decided to like,

Speaker 3:          01:42:26       okay, that's good. It says it has aunts. It's something an extract. It's an ant extract type in x and that's what they're calling it, man. It's fucking cialis, you know, that um, that brazilian wandering spiders, that's what they're trying to figure out what that thing, why it causes erections and they're going to try to turn that into like the next supervisor aggro. You've heard of That shit. The brazilian wondering spider. It kills you and gives you this unbelievable boner before you die. Most people die of it, but apparently if you live your dick's done, it's just like, it's like taking an engine and just red lining. Okay. just, you know, it's, it's hitting the fucking the bottom of the tac officer and then it just explodes. The engine blows up. So most people, they, they don't live from it, but if you do live your dick's broken. So they're trying to take that as smart people would turn that into a boner pills. I don't know man.

Speaker 2:          01:43:19       Here's the extract. This one is just another one super aunt and it's a, it's a, you can buy it for $34 and it's just extracted aunts and they're wildly used. An agent promotes strength, sexual vego law, vigor, vigor, powerpoint, anti aging thing. So. So we have all these ants. There's so much fucking that a fucking all have boners the same error

Speaker 3:          01:43:44       knucklehead. I don't think you're talking about the same ants. I bet. I bet that's a very specific type of answer.

Speaker 2:          01:43:48       Does the fda have to say, but when 50 percent ground raw and

Speaker 5:          01:43:53       extra, does it say that ground raw aunts and aunt extract? Yep. What that means. They've taken a bunch of ants and extracted it. So each book, that's what I'm sending each pill you take. IT's like $500 million ants. Probably boners all adds up. And it analogy is that

Speaker 1:          01:44:10       they have celery and celery juice altogether in the same bowl, right? The aunt and the aunt extract. So there's crush up the. Yeah. So the aunt is like the hard part and then the extract is like the gooey stuff that keeps it all together. Yeah. Meanwhile, probably does nothing.

Speaker 5:          01:44:26       I'm going to create a salamander pill tomorrow that makes yoU live 10 yearS longer. People will Buy it. I might give you one of theSe hot duncan swears by it. Now I wonder what

Speaker 1:          01:44:36       like who writes these supplement critiques? and it's like all talking about how hard your cockiness. Oh, I've heard of this stuff before though. It's called um, uri coma long full leah and it's supposed to be a natural testosterone booster also. This stuff, um, I think this stuff has a lot of shit in it that's probably would give you a boner, whether it's the aunt, maybe that's.

Speaker 5:          01:45:05       Well, that's one of the things. It's just one of the ingredients in this, but that long fully shit

Speaker 1:          01:45:10       that is supposed to be a testosterone booster. There's a few of those is something called tongue got ali. That's supposed to be a natural and then it's tribulus, which everybody knows, which apparently varies pretty widely in strength and efficacy. I think it's sorta like garlic or some things like you'll, you'll get garlic, it's not that strong and sometimes you'll get it. You're like, holy shit, this is powerful garlic, or like the way a tomato tastes like a beef steak. Tomatoes from someone's backyard versus one of those pale tomatoes. I think you'd get that same sort of shit with a lot of these herbal supplements. I bet if you could get that stuff like from the plant instead of like some ground up powdered bullshit. I bet if you get like tribulus, I think tribulus or route, right? Was it a route? I'm not sure. I bet if you get that shit right from the tree, make declicker. Damn.

Speaker 5:          01:45:59       I found that you shouldn't take any of these pills. If you do ecstasy at the same time, you can fuck your shit up really bad. Break your heart, your heart, your heart. Maybe you are a bitch to be fun, but that seems like the best mix, but yeah, that's what eddie bravo calls. Phone or flip flops to see. Oh my agro. Crazy. What? You don't have to take these pills. No, no, no, but what I'm saying, you shouldn't take viagra or any of this stuff because if it has any kind of the biafra or you're not supposed to take that with ecstasy, there's some real dangers there. Yeah, it fucks your heart up. Bullshit. Google it. Let's don't take viagra with agora ecstasy. I learned it on air or air, whatever that arrow in the. Oh really? Yeah. Okay. Era, would I? Yeah, I still did it, but whatever.

Speaker 1:          01:46:46       While you were living on the edge and you're, you're a wild man. Well, let's say don't take viagra with ecstasy. Sex to see. Don't mix, but I know so many people that say it's awesome.

Speaker 2:          01:46:58       Oh yeah, it does. Because they don't know. You shouldn't be doing it well and you shouldn't be drinking. Yeah. Yeah. Use that stuff. Kills you. You smoke it. When I'm on, when I'm on ecstasy, I usually don't drink that much. I usually just drink orange juice and water and gatorade and fucking tons of water and appeal it, and

Speaker 1:          01:47:15       there's several dangers and combining viagara and ecstasy. First of all, soc is a powerful mind altering drug that impairs judgment. When I talked like that, it means I'm reading something, combining it with viagra. It encourages people to engage in unsafe and risky sexual behavior, aka brian's whole life. Okay, so you're saying that it's dangerous because of that, public health officials feel this combo will increase the spread of aids and slash or other sexually transmitted diseases. First of all, if you have a real medical issue, here's what happens. First of all, you don't say that first, so I don't believe them because that saying that first means that the most important thing is to stop, but sex, that's what you're trying to do. You're trying to stop aids. You try to say that people are going to get sexually crazy and sexually risky. Okay? That is not an argument. You can't tell me what I'm going to do. You can't tell me, you know, I can handle Being drunk. I don't drive when I'm drunk, I don't get fucked up and go buttfuck. Okay?

Speaker 2:          01:48:06       What you're telling me that ecstasy is such a touching drug that when you have a raging boner on top of it, it's pretty dangerous.

Speaker 1:          01:48:13       I don't think it's dangerous. I don't think it's dangerous at all. I think it's dangerous for some people. Just like cars are dangerous for some people. If you give them a cell phone, they text because some people have shitty fucking self control, but I don't think that this. There's no, there's no like argument medically in that. I mean there might be this thing called [inaudible] and [inaudible] is like the boners that won't go down. Oh, that's just from taking ecstasy or are viagara rather that you can get that in a viagara situation. Like the fact that you're on ecstasy, that it doesn't. It makes it worse because now every time you take guys like better. Yeah, you're dick has a heartbeat and then you need to have somebody swallow that. So few people have that problem with those boner pills where they actually have to go to a doctor because if you have that, that that's like an erection that you have to go to a doctor for, right? Yeah,

Speaker 2:          01:49:00       yeah, no, no, no. It even says on the commercial owners may last up to three days

Speaker 1:          01:49:05       that disease though that priapism, the erection, which is the technical term that can kill your dick. Just like the brazilian wandering spider can kill your dick. It's the same thing. The exact same thing. In fact, don't go into the jungle. Well, if you can. oh deon viagra. Like say it is a check and you bang. You're dying to have sex with her and you think tonight is the night, but you're so scared that you're afraid that you're never gonna be able to get it up because you just got to be in a panic. You know? You know what? I'm going to take six viagara just in case is so hot and then your crazy ass, which by the way exists. I'm sure some dudes. Sure. and just decide that they want a dick that's purple. Just an angry purple bursting cock. Like a ballpark frank, one of those ballpark

Speaker 3:          01:49:48       franks that you like to spend. Not like an amateur would do it. And like burn the outside. Know a slow cooker where that motherfucker's greasy and sweating and just getting gigantic die. That's what your dick looks like and you start to slowly see little splits in the scenes. We have thin red lines around your cock and various places because the skin is fucking bursting like a stretch mark and a fat lady stomach after she has three kids inside of it and they pop out triplets and then her skin has to go back to normal. That's what your dick looks like. that kind of stretched out crazy scar tissue where your dick, it's just barely holding on like a fucking balloon that's being pushed to the limit is just got up and went to take root. That's how thrilling my story was. He's on ecstasy all blowing up. Dick is too much. He's going to go beat off.

Speaker 2:          01:50:38       Guaranteed right now. Imagine you on viagra in you are. You were fucking peaking on ecstasy and you have this crazy rock hard boner and you're in a waterbed with this guy. It that those two medications might cause you to like just figuring it out.

Speaker 3:          01:50:55       Don't forget that's the dude rather. Yeah, that's a strange look. This guy had brian pulled up, has long blonde, beautiful hair, and he also has a dark, dark beard and somebody put that online, give the dude props, who is a put that online, rhubarb rhubarb with the wolverine avatar, so you know he's got some taste powerful x men fan and this guy has a some sort of a g string type thing up his butt crack and he's very well built and it looks very handsome. Perhaps middle eastern art or spanish, maybe a spaniard, but like a thick weightlifting. Dave navarro, I think it was a nice, thick, solid and tight as the underground would say. Yeah, he's a. That's a big boy. That guy's got some horsepower to his.

Speaker 2:          01:51:37       So you're an ecstasy. But viagra in a waterbed at a fucking w.

Speaker 3:          01:51:42       It's looks like we're gonna fight to the death. That's what I'm saying. That's what I think they're trying to say with this. To try and not do it or fighting to the death. That's what I think is going to happen. If you insist on pursuing this line

Speaker 1:          01:51:58       of action, sir, we will have to fight to the death and the only other thing is the ecstasy causes high blood pressure and dehydration and that viagra only worsens those effects, but all that means to me is that you have to drink water. Like don't be stupid.

Speaker 2:          01:52:13       Yeah, but sometimes when you're on ecstasy, it's hard to even drink anything that you feel like you're going to puke it back up. You know

Speaker 1:          01:52:18       what I didn't hear? Hear? I didn't hear strokes. I didn't hear cancer. I didn't hear any of the shit that it would keep me from doing ecstasy and and viagra at the same time. I heard nothing. I heard, if this kills you, you're kind of a pussy. That's what I heard. That's what I'm getting out of this. If you die from ecstasy and viagara together, you kind of a not saying you should take viagra and excess together. In fact, I'm saying you definitely shouldn't take viagra and extra city. It doesn't say nothing before the heart. I'm saying you shouldn't for spiritual reasons. I think you know when you're involved in that ecstasy feely, touchy thing, it should be nonsexual. It should be that you can't get it up. Just enjoy it as a human being. Everything doesn't have to be about sticking your dirty loads places, brian. Okay. It doesn't have to be inside of us to be all about you shooting loads all over the place. How will you let it go? Pow and just be in the moment. Hold hands with somebody.

Speaker 5:          01:53:06       Okay. I masturbated and it used a paper towel to clean up and it's through it on my coffee table and then my friend came over and we were watching a show and she goes like, she sneezed and she goes, can I, can I use this paper towel? I'm like, sure, I forgot that was the load paper towel. She's like, oh, what song? Over a nice. Well that's a nice way to sort of get someone to touch your comment if you're really into that. Yeah, and a great. None of my dna is on her hand. Yeah. If you want it to come bomb somebody speaking a combined, and I got to thank chris

Speaker 1:          01:53:39       calver. He's the guy that made this a buddha statue. Oh, can you check this shit out? There it is.

Speaker 5:          01:53:49       That's cool as fuck man. That's, that's your tattoo.

Speaker 1:          01:53:52       It's exactly like pretty close. He just made in a physical form with the third eye. You can see it like that is like this. And by the way, this position that this thing is. I didn't ask him to do this, but what's hilarious is that this is exactly the reason I got this tattoo is because I had this crazy dmt trip that really like made me reassess. RealIty made me reassess my life and one of the most humbling aspects of the trip, there was an infinite series of these golden buddhas that was flying in front of me and trying to explain like positive energy in life to me. And um, I turned it into a tattoo and it literally looked like that in the dmt trip. Like literally looked just like this thing, except it was made out of some strange kind of light and there was no borders to it, if that makes any sense.

Speaker 1:          01:54:45       It does. Shouldn't do. Dmt has this very intense, like almost like a two d sort of a thing that happens sometimes where everything sort of seems connected on one plane, but then you realize that it's just this crazy sort of fractal thing going on. And when that was happening in that trip, this is what I saw. I saw these things just like everywhere. Would it mean to you man, I was high as fuck kind of question. Is that I don't know. can't, can't, can never. Who knows when you're out on psychedelics, there's so mucH different shit that's going on. Like for anybody to say, I know that this happened. I know that that happened and I have said those things you can't eat right. You know, you don't know what the fuck happened were interpretation and you're on a fucking crazy drug man. There's a lot going on there. You know, I wouldn't really bank on any one possible answer to any of your shit. True. Do you, um, do you, um, you, you play a lot of professional poker, you take different things like before you deployed, do you smoke when you do hormone? Dependent upon the area of I'm sure of course, yeah. Because it can be tricky getting some weed and some spots. Right?

Speaker 8:          01:55:57       Uh, I would say, I mean alpha brain the last year I've been taking and I found it to be beneficial. Definitely it makes me more clear about, you know what I mean? Like when I take it I just feel like my

Speaker 1:          01:56:08       thoughts are just clear. They're clear. Well if it, it feels to me that you, you're getting what your brain needs in order to function best to seems like that nutrition wise, how many do you take? Usually just to do you take it right before you do an event? Like how do you do it?

Speaker 8:          01:56:22       Like when I play online, like on sundays is the biggest day for poker, so I'll take it like when I wake up, like when I'm making my shake or whatever.

Speaker 1:          01:56:29       I take four before every ufc for four. Yup. It says on here you should only take a maximum for. Oh wait, no. Says do not seek four capsules in 24 hours. Okay. Let's say I violated that too. Should I say for what? You probably don't listen to me, but I do. Yeah. If I'm doing it like a ufc, first of all you have fcs. It's a, there's a lot that's going on like when you're watching a fight and uh, especially when it comes to describing ground positions, it's really hard to coordinate your thoughts. Like, okay, he's got his right foot in this position. Now what he's got to do to finish this off because he's got to turn his. And I'm like, god, there's got to get his left foot underneath his right knee. And then I got to get this all done. I have to get it all out in a way that people are going to be able to understand.

Speaker 1:          01:57:12       While the fight is actually happening, so I gotta kind of like manage. I have, first of all I have to see what he's doing so I have to know what direction he can do and what the counter could possibly be and then when I see a guy going after and I wanted to get the audience excited, I want to say this is where he's in trouble. Like you see this, this is pulling down on his neck and he's, he's in a bad situation here and if he could get his leg over here, then it's over, you know, and the alpha brain and any, any nootropics. I took that neuro one ship before I took out. I noticed a difference. I noticed that I could get sentences out, clear my thoughts, my thoughts, my thoughts, my thoughts for it seemed like they formulate it easier and it just makes sense.

Speaker 1:          01:57:49       I mean there's isolated a bunch of different shit that improves your memory statistically proven. Like you can see people taking it and then people have done double blind tests on different nootropics when it comes to memory enhancement. And there's like prasad tam and a bunch of different ones that are really interesting and it as this caffeine, you know, caffeine has a performance enhancing quality to it as well. Absolutely. Because you're more jacked up. There's some shit going. I mean that's why you can only take in certain. I think of the olympics and I think even in the Nevada state athletic commission, they have a limit to how much caffeine of fighter can have in their system. I didn't know that she also had actually a set of hip to that because he does it in a pill form to make sure that he never takes more than than you're supposed to because you could get like starbucks, like this one, like a venti.

Speaker 1:          01:58:35       If you have a starbucks, venti and you compare that to like coffee that you're going to get at jerry's deli. This is a big difference. Yeah. You mean? Depends who makes it to. I mean it might be just different, you know, but more or less in there. Yeah. The starbucks ones haven't seen amounts of caffeine. So you might be possible to actually like piss hot for caffeine. If you drank like a bunch of a it, I wonder how many you would have to drink. Like how many mentees? I bet you could only drink a couple before you die. No, there's dudes could drink that shit all day following day. Fully got to a point where he was drinking so much coffee a day that he had a drink it black because he was drinking several quarts of half and half a day. What saying, dude, I'm not bullshitting. He used to. Oh yeah. He doesn't give a fuck. He loves it. He loves coffee. He used to drink it by the pot. Just get him back on the podcast. I missed that. Kind of love the fuck out of that dude. He's a great guy. There's um, there's a. Why isn't the caffeine khan listed for starbucks? Beverage is apparently people want caffeine. Content is variable and starbucks currently doesn't have any quantitative caffeine information for all of our beverages. We intend on adding caffeine in information in a future upgrade.

Speaker 5:          01:59:49       I love that. We into. We don't have the. I'm sorry, I don't know why. Almost shaking. Why am I shaking? If I know to my coffee, I don't know. I wonder if they even tested like they, even though they probably test it and go, what the fuck that closed the door light. This place on fire. Kill everybody that saw the results. We got to retreat and figure out what we're going to tell people before we come back. I bet starbucks, not only would they not tested, they should find out what equipment is used to test caffeine levels and buy them all out and burn them. Blow them up. Okay. Because it's really clear. We are

Speaker 1:          02:00:23       red line people. Fucking gills. Oh, I don't think we know what we're doing a lot of stuff. Yeah, there's apparently there's a caffeine database. You can find out how much different things have in it and uh, it's all about milligrams per fluid ounce. And like say like, if you would go with like a red bull. Let's see if we could find red bull here. Some of them are crazy mad. Holy shit. There's something called 50 1:50 juice. Okay. It has 6,000 milligrams of caffeine per port, per every 500 fluid ounces.

Speaker 5:          02:01:05       I tell you, I lived mostly off just a trenta a day and you know, coconut water, but

Speaker 1:          02:01:09       that doesn't make sense. Well, hold on a second. That doesn't make any sense. How is it 500 fluid ounces? That's too low. Of course it would be much larger than everybody else's because everybody else is like 11 fluid ounces, six fluid ounces. So this is 500 flu announces. What are they doing? And measuring it for a jug. That's so stupid. Why? How the fuck did that even get included? I can't even

Speaker 5:          02:01:28       because most people can't do the math to get it done to where it needs to be.

Speaker 1:          02:01:32       Oh, 500, right. So what you're saying, brian, you have a trenta

Speaker 5:          02:01:35       I haven't yet. I'm pretty good on caffeine nowadays. I usually drink a trenta

Speaker 2:          02:01:40       and then you know, coconut water and water most of the most, most of the time now. But uh, I've been on those five hour energy drinks a lot lately. Is there anything negative with drinking those, you know, because they're mostly what? Be 12? Yeah,

Speaker 1:          02:01:53       no, it'd be 12. Was water soluble. You piss it out if you have too much and it's not dangerous. It's very healthy. B, 12 is a really good supplement. More people should be on b. Twelve is great for your immune system. B, 12 is just a good all around energy supplement. It's so good that like and people that work crazy hours, video games sometimes like those guys that are forced to work like 16 hour days, like many days in a row and then trying to complete a people on sets. They give them b, 12 shots. It's like super, super common. They give you intramuscular b, 12 shots. Then wrestlers do that. A lot of wrestlers do that before they compete. They'll take like an intramuscular v12 yeah, it's so. It's that healthy for you. So it's way better than starbucks because starbucks, I mean although it is delicious and I'm drinking some right now, there's a lot of fucking caffeine in that bitch. A venti starbucks brewed coffee ready? A regular cup of coffee that you would get at a diner. The average cup of coffee and eight ounce cup of coffee has a hundred and 80 milligrams of caffeine, a venti starbucks has 415 as tested in this test. So I don't know if I'm, you know, this test, who knows? I mean, it might've been one really strong batch. I don't know how many batches they tested. I don't know if this guy just made all these numbers up and put it on his websites, which is

Speaker 2:          02:03:08       starbucks itself, a caffeine free, decaffeinated coffee that they add 12 to.

Speaker 1:          02:03:14       Well, one of the things that is good idea, but one of the things that you, uh, you got to remember if you say decaffeinated decaf coffee, has caffeine in it. Just very small amounts. No, no. It has quite a lot. In fact, some people say that there are decaf coffee. Let's, let's find out like how much it has. So we already established that a tall. Okay. Let's just a tall brewed coffee from starbucks has 260 apoe apparently as this guy saying. So let's find out how much caffeine, decaf hasn't it? Because I know there's some in there and it's not a little amount. I think it'S a lot. How much caffeine?

Speaker 6:          02:03:54       I can't spell.

Speaker 1:          02:03:56       Who told you that is what the fuck facts that come? No. Does decaf starbucks out of? No. I know. I know you can't get it all out on. It. Needs more food for the studio. I'll have some sun in. what? Do you want more of those? a buffalo things? No. Is it true? how much caffeine does decaf com compare? Contain? It must. There's no, I guarantee you there's caffeine in there.

Speaker 2:          02:04:22       So you play a lot of online pokers. debbie noticed that there's a lot of cheaters online. Is there a lot of programs? I mean, is it even fair to play online nowadays? is a really good question. Um, I'll just address that by telling you a story. When I was in, I

Speaker 8:          02:04:38       was in the library, you know how they have those cubicles with computers in them. I was walking by and I, this was just when I got into poker and I looked in one and there was a guy playing poker, so I was like, oh, knock on the door and see what's going on. Knock on the door. He opens up, he's playing on the computer that they have there. He's playing on a laptop and then another laptop. Now that wouldn't be that abnormal. However, he's playing the same six player tournament on all three. So he essentially cs six cards out of 52, which gives you a gigantic advantage. So yes, there's shooting. Absolutely. So he's playing as three different characters. He's playing us. Yes, exactly. So there's six people. It's a call to sit and go. So six people enter and then top to get paid is illegal. What are you doing? No, absolutely not. No. Wow. So yeah, it happens a lot. Caffeine,

Speaker 1:          02:05:32       um, content of decaf is a much less. It says to label it decaf, it must have at least 97 percent of the caffeine removed. So that leaves about five milligrams as compared to 100 to 150 for six ounces of brewed coffee. They're saying 150. The other one I think said a little bit more, but I think it's variable obviously. And as they're talking about six ounces. So that's um, that's five milligrams. It's not very much.

Speaker 2:          02:05:56       No, I said that. So it's definitely not going in.

Speaker 1:          02:06:00       But if you're sensitive to caffeine and you drink quite a few of those, you got to think five, 10, 15, 20, like it started. Now you're starting to get to a point where you might feel it, but as opposed to like 100 which was like a regular cup of coffee or more.

Speaker 2:          02:06:11       So to a point it is broken the online poker because you can pretty much Just gang up on people. so like a single new person sitting there, you can just pretty much play all the other characters. Fucking rolled again.

Speaker 8:          02:06:22       Yeah. so the problem is with cash games and with, with smaller tournaments, when you get bigger tournaments, I have 10,000 players in them. It's not such a big deal. But yeah, there's definitely some cheating going on and I've, you know, I've had multiple times where I'm like, there's something fishy going on here. What about bots behind an issue? Not really. They can be like low stakes, but when you get people that recognize patterns, good players that recognize patterns, they're going to know you're a button, just take advantage of it. But when you're, um, I, I heard this has been done, I don't know if it's still being done, but let's say if you would go into a room and it was like a six person table, like they're allowed to have artificial people. They're allowed to have, like, they could run a bot that's playing you.

Speaker 8:          02:07:06       I don't think, uh, it's, it's, it's allowed. No, no, I don't think it's allowed. I think um, when the sites find them, they, they shut them down. Okay. So that's, that's just misinformation. Yeah. So if someone says that they played against three bots and one other dude, it's not right? Well, they may have been but, but it's not like it's not illegal. Yeah. You're not supposed to do that. Where is it legal to gamble now? Still not legal to gamble if it's an american website, right. We're not allowed to play poker. I'm home skins consulting adults. You're not even allowed to play poker poker with money. Right? We can do that still, but only only in vegas and casinos and casinos.

Speaker 1:          02:07:40       You're at home like are you allowed to have a poker game with a bunch of your friends and you have like stacks of hundreds on the table and getting crazy and drinking.

Speaker 8:          02:07:46       Is that illegal? No. Well, yes. The way it is, like if, if the house takes a rake, it's illegal. If you're just playing with your friends and you know, it seems like five bucks. You say, hey, we'll play for five bucks and what have you played for $50,000? That's fine. I think as long as there's no rape being collected. Really? Yeah. Is that true? I don't actually, I don't know that for a fact, but I'm pretty sure that's where it is. I feel like you would have to pay taxes on that shit and then it's illegal, but still have to pay taxes. You have to, you have to claIm the claim it. Yeah. That's another reason why they made it illegal here is because the taxes were just, they were not being paid by a lot of people because it's based off shore. It was based in Ireland, uh, england and Costa Rica. What were the three big assignment?

Speaker 1:          02:08:26       Isn't that a, you know, irs problem? How could they deny the entire. I mean, it seems like as a technology issue, how could you deny an entire industry they weren't getting paid off.

Speaker 8:          02:08:36       It's about the money. They're not getting revenue because the sites are based offshore, so they're only getting revenue when people pay their taxes.

Speaker 1:          02:08:43       People that have sites on shore and then make the money from that and then say, yeah, and then say if you have an offshore when you have to pay taxes on it or we'll get you.

Speaker 8:          02:08:52       Listen, there's a lot of thIngs in this world that just don't make any sense. I could fix so much. Just simple logic, logic. Hey listen, I mean it's, it's incredibly terrible that I have to play. I mean, I like Mexico. I'm right on the beach. It's beautiful. There's a lot of dolphins swimming by, but like that where you live right now? Yeah, I'm live in Mexico. I have a house. He lives there too, right? Jc still live in Mexico city? I think so, yeah. So you live in Mexico near the beach. You don't say where because they will come get you. They'll know about. I live right on the beach. It's beautiful. I love listening to the way as I go to sleep. It's awesome. But I miss a lot of, a lot of things about the states, like the law, the law, the food was a lot of things I missed, you know.

Speaker 8:          02:09:33       Um. Have you ever seen any crazy shit living in Mexico? Have you seen some things that have made you go, oh, okay, we're not in Kansas anymore. One of the first days I was there, I went for a run on the beach and there's um, like a, a cliff and it's kind of a secluded on one end and there were two people just banging it out rigHt there hanging out sexually. Oh yeah, that's fine. That was fine. But no, as far as like weird things, I mean, did you watch, did you sit there and let them finish? I was looking right in his eyes. What I'm saying is you don't see, you don't see very many like crime situation. No, I don't put myself in positions to be in that. I basically stay in the resort the whole time. I mean I go out to go and get food.

Speaker 8:          02:10:10       So you live in a resort? Yeah, basically they have like pools and tennis courts, basketball courts and stuff like that. So you just stay in the resort base. Wow. So you're like living in an apartment? Yeah. That's surrounded by a whole nother country that you don't venture into basically. Whoa. I go in like probably I would say twice a week. That's a true. Are you a, what's called an ex pat? Are you like an official ex pat? I wouldn't consider myself an ex pat. But you live in Mexico? Well I have a house in vegas. I own a house. Oh. So I rented it out while I go to Mexico and play. Wow, that's cool. So you have to be in Mexico to do this. I can't put like if I was right here and I tried to fire it up, it wouldn't let me.

Speaker 8:          02:10:45       The ip will be blocked. Wow. Wow. And not only that, but now there's millions and millions of dollars that's doj has seized from full tilt poker. That's just sitting there. We haven't been paid that back yet. so what they basically did was they shut the site's down. It was, I think it was um, April 15th, something like that. They shut all the sites down and if you had money online deck went to the doj and now you have to sub. You have to ask them for your money back and we still can't get our money back. Oh wow. Good. Be creepy government. It is. Yep. Creepy fucking government, man. I, I, I'm just baffled that, you know, against other consenting adults. I can't play poker with them. Well, it's really gross.

Speaker 3:          02:11:29       We allow grown adults to tell us what we can and can't do when it comes to situations like this that is not in. That is not. That's not a tax issue because it should be completely unrelated. How how you pay your taxes should be your personal responsibility based on what your actually income is. Absolutely. If you want to hide your gambling income, they should be able to find out or you only make $50,000 a year. How do you have a $300,000 car? So oh, let's go online. See this motherfucker plays poker all day and he's not reporting his winnings like I'm all for that. I think everybody should have to pay their share, but you shouldn't be able to tell me what I can do.

Speaker 8:          02:12:01       That's stupid. I agree. I know. You can see. Look, you can google anyone's name and see what they've won. It's just, it's out there. It's all. It's all public because when you cash in a tournament, it shows it online.

Speaker 3:          02:12:10       Yeah. You know what about didn't know what was it filled? Full tilt poker that got busted for fraud, who got busted for fraud? Absolute poker, absolute poker. What would they do?

Speaker 8:          02:12:18       They had a guy that basically could see your whole cards, like an admin, but yeah, he liked recreated some kind of. I dunno, I'm not very computer savvy, but something that he could see every card at the table and what he was doing was he was just winning these insane amounts of money and not even trying to hide it. LIke for example, uh, when he won a tournament, he made a call at the last one, the last car. The river came out with 10 high. I don't know if you play poker, not, but basically a call that you would net that I've never met in my life. Okay. Right. Never because it's never good. and he was right because he could see the guys cards, but it's like, how are you going to be that blatant about it? If you could see that, why would you not just play cool a little bit more discreet. Exactly. Get third in the tournament once. Maybe he's in prison now or is he does the thing. Man, there's the grid, there's so much gray area with, with poker and law, so he's, he's not in jail. Well,

Speaker 3:          02:13:14       there was that guy who was trying to run an mma organization as well. That bodog guy, calvin era. Was it? YEs. Yeah, yeah. He had like this whole thing that he was doing. Well, he was having these guys like fight on the beach and you know, this beautiful resort in Costa Rica or something like that. you know, he put the fights

Speaker 7:          02:13:32       like, um, the beach. I saw his house. I was in Costa Rica. Golfing was on the golf course. He's a baller. He's a baller. He's a powerful baller, but he's forced to live in another country. He can't come to America. He comes to America. He'd be arrested. That'd be arrested. Him and dana white where they had like this big go back and forth. it was pretty hilarious. Twitter are longtime before twitter, before on websites and interviews and stuff like that. But he had like his picture, like he would have these built bull billboards with like him in a beautiful suit with girls behind him. Calvin, I or presents put dog fights like what a solid man is selling. You looking like a pimp, but unsexy. He's selling the lifestyle. That's what people are fascinated by that not just fascinated by the fights. They're fascinated by his lifestyle, but he was forced into exile because of online gambling.

Speaker 7:          02:14:17       Right. And the crazy part about it is, is a, you can still gamble on horses, but you can get them on the lottery. The lottery scratch tickets are available at every gas station and that's chance poker is skill. I've had eight years of. I've had one losing year out of eight years. Yeah. But that's, uh, yeah, that's rare. That wasn't it. Yeah. The three percent of people will make money playing poker. Three percent, three percent. That's similar to professional pool and fighting as well. Yeah. The top guys. How many comedians? Pretty much everything and pretty much everything. Yeah. Right. It makes it real. If it's real money. Yeah. Yeah. Ditch diggers often, like, I think they all get the same amount for them. Dolphin, sex doesn't even make sense, bro. Like, how many times do people hang out with dolphins and not fuck them? Probably three percent.

Speaker 7:          02:15:04       How many are successful that try to fuck them? That would be what it would be. No, because dolphins want to fuck back to shut the fuck up. Stop read it. Can't be able to talk to you. Can't believe I just engaged you back, brought you back into the full pitch. Um, yeah. Most, most poker players, what do they do to make a living? It's what I do. It's the only thing I do, but most don't. Most. Well I can't speak for everyone else. I know that there's probably maybe 50 guys I can name them. Make good money. I mean there's some guys that make stupid money and they have like they, they, they're always into crazy bets. Like they'll play golf for a million dollars or something. Yeah. Pretty normal isn't the top one percent that is so fucking crazy. It is. To play a round of golf for a million bucks.

Speaker 7:          02:15:49       But that's so normal, isn't it? Will you do those guys for them? Yeah. Yeah. I don't bet a million dollars. Have you ever had a crazy bad about something like who's going to lose the most about a way to take the longest shit or because that's the kind of things they bet on. Right? I could ship the longest complete shit ever. We bet on a lot of weird things. Like we bet one time we met a guy that he wouldn't take a shot glass full of like steak rub. Hello? Yeah, he was a lot. A little water. He did you know that that guy could die if that's all salt. I did not know that. I think if you eat like a pound of salt, you could die. I guess the shot glass is not a pound shot glass, but be submitted in that stake rep is like more granulated space in between.

Speaker 7:          02:16:29       It's not as heavY as like morton salt. Right? Like if you drank a shot glass of morton salt, that would be impressive as fuck it. Let's dig. rob's not quite heavy. Like a. That's like a. If you can stay in a pool for 24 hours, things like that. The state in a pool for 24 hours. Who did that? I don't remember his name, but he did take probably because he died in that pool. Um, what about that guy? Do you know him? The famous gambler in vegas that actually got breast implants? Do you know that story? I think I remember seeing that a while ago on tv. Um, he wore them for a whole year. That was the, that was the bet. I don't know him personally. Isn't a legendary. Isn't that guy legendary character? What's his name? We're gOing. I can tell you if he isn't telling me his name had been on the show poker after dark. Nope. Have not been on that. I was on um, one of the espn, a world series poker ones. that's cool. Yeah. Actually like watching that show, what is the, what is the, the most success you've had with poker? You mean like most one in a day or something? Or most one like, you know, ever $100,000. The guy won. He won $100,000. Looking at him there. What was his name?

Speaker 7:          02:17:36       Brian zen. I don't know. I've never cashed in on $100,000. Bet by getting breast implants for a year. Yeah. I don't know. Eight years later he still has them. Are you serious? You keep them? Yeah. See, I think I would keep them too. I think after a couple months he'd be like, dude, it's fucking high. I had really nice tits. Boobs are awesome. I don't think that's what it is. I think he probably does it because he's nuts. As far as a. I can tell you the most I've lost in the day. It was 25 k wow. That's kind. Suck it and that really sucked. But the wind was two. Oh, nine in a day. Two hundred 9,000 g's. Louisa, what did you. What's the first thing you bought? Did you buy any? I bought a lexus. Nice. Nice for cash. Nice. Yeah, it's quick. that's a good car too, because that's sounded like stepping out of line.

Speaker 7:          02:18:23       Not getting crazy. Didn't go bentley. No, no. You bought like a sense of car. That's a nice car that's out there right now. I love that car. It's really reliable. I love it. That's the thing about lexis, man. Those things are bulletproof. I had one of those big trucks as qx, whatever the fuck it was. Amazing car man there. So well designed to. Yeah, they have that new one. They have the new version of the ls there. They're big flagship sedan. It might as well be a spaceship mean it. Parks itself hit a button and it parallel parks for you. Like that has been nana's. It's crazy. The fucking thing. Actually. Parks for you. Cameras in the front, cameras in the rear, you know all this different shit that makes it run perfect. So it's amazing how like computer control and all these things. Oh my god, I can't wait until five to 10 years from now will be the google car. The car that's driving around now. That's going to suck. Dude. I'm going to lose all your fucking fun. Yeah, that's true. It's true. It should be that. You should have the option to do it that way. fuck that way. or it's just on a table. you should

Speaker 3:          02:19:28       be able to have the option to either have the google car. Not like being able to almost like ride a train. Like I just want to be fun for long trips, like a five hour drive and just sit there with your ipad or watch a movie. You wouldn't be able to avoid all the other crazy assholes. It didn't have google cars. It's true. It's true. Can switching lanes and shit and make it even hit the brakes. You'd probably be sitting there with no seatbelt to get in an accident. You're probably not. The lag is. I wonder if they ever figure out that this accidents that are caused by the google car that w or caused because the google car couldn't respond as quickly or as precisely as a person could where there was options. Google car, car trolls. The shitty option. I'm done with engines, bro.

Speaker 3:          02:20:05       I'm like living right now. I like this right now. Oh yeah. I think we get to enjoy this. Well, allegedly I took that car up to 1:40. Oh, allegedlY. That's scary. Fast. That's like, that's a wheel fall off fast feeling. No. Well it's interesting because I'm allegedly. I also took my old saab up to $100. It was shaking. Yeah. This one was clean. It's big difference, man. Those japanese engineers, they're not fucking playing games. We're not playing around. There's a. Have you ever seen that one crazy lexis that they held the ls lf lfo? Lfo. Elephants lfa and say yeah, jesus, they had one and um, when I went to vegas to get my car serviced, they have one in the showroom and I was just like a half a million dollars. Yeah, it's, yeah, I think they stopped making them though and they only had a certain amount.

Speaker 3:          02:20:49       Yeah, I think they made like $300. How much was it? 300. I think it's super duper expensive, but it was just weird that it was like performance wise, it wasn't really much better than a nissan gtr if better at all that she saw something where they raised those two, I think. And it was pretty comparable. Yeah. Gtr is a $100,000 car and it's a monster and that's another same coin. That's an insane piece of engineering and it's also something that apparently nissan doesn't really even make any money on it. They just wanted to prove a point. It's really kind of a country move. They're like put out a better car, cheaper and like deal with it. They're like, your prices are way too high. We're going to bring them down like good luck for rory. How much is that thing? $300,000 to come up with that number.

Speaker 3:          02:21:30       I want to know how they come up with that number, how much it costs. You ever seen it? Ferrari factory does. They're artisans. They're big difference between like a ferrari and a like just if you're going to buy a ferrari, you're going to buy something that's made by craftsmen like the leather stitching. The dash has done by hand. The car's engines pieced together by a bunch of specialists. TheY all do it in this gigantic, beautiful, clean warehouse where they eat espresso at lunch and take two hour naps and these are like artists and they put together these, these machines that are. They're not just beautiful and not just like perfect engineering, but it sounded. They can construct it like there's just like a feeling to them like, like if you're into watches and he pick up a rolex and feel the automatic timer and know that someone like put all that shit together, there's something to mechanical things that are created by the human hand that makes him like really special to us and you don't really get that with the gtr. You do.

Speaker 1:          02:22:25       I mean it is designed by man and put together. But what you get, it's like this feeling of this crazy technological marvel like you get in it and you feel like, you know the lights come on though. The, the, the, the, the engine revs up. You hear the turbines like whoa. Like this is a fucking spaceship. This thing is a, some, some crazy piece of the most advanced automobile technology available, but it doesn't feel like an old ferrari. Like if you started up and he had a bomb and you realize some of the italian dudes built this thing and stitch these seats together by hand. You know when you pull the seatbelt, it's all. Someone made all this shit. You know, you feel that leather steering wheel and like everything's mechanical and moving the shifter and hearing the clickety clack. There's something about like, man created things that in my opinion is like, it's like art in a physical form that's functional and that you use, you know, and there's this. Whenever someone tells me like, oh, don't even like cars. You know, cars are stupid to me. A car's just gets you where you want to go. Okay. Have you ever driven a shelby mustang? Do you even know what the fuck you're talking about? You, you don't, you don't like that feeling when you hit the gas and you hear and feel those fucking tires squeaking a little bit because they're trying to get some traction because there's so much fucking horsepower

Speaker 8:          02:23:40       then you're not alive, man. You're not alive. You really need a prius. You got to try that one. So at least it's a good feeling. It is a good feeling. Amazing. Especially when you do standard because then you really feel like you're part of the car. That I'll make that lexis so standard. Even though the wall that I can bring it in and I can actually do up and down with the shifter, but it's not the same because you know, you don't have the feet. That's like being a little kid in high school. It does not drive a stick shift and you pretending to shifting the gears and your role and exactly what it is and it won't even actually there's a, there's things put in place where you can't, it'll, it'll, it'll, um, gear up even if you don't. Because if you could take it to a certain point. So it's not really real. Yeah. Yeah. It's bullshit. It's bullshit. My m three has that. They have a doubles watch. Yeah. It's nice and it's great for traffic. Sure. You know, and it's, it, it's way more efficient

Speaker 1:          02:24:26       than you would ever be with a clutch. So clutch is kind of stupid in the long run, but this is that mechanical feeling. Again, the thing of shifting your own gears and turning on, stealing, steering wheel, there's a thrill to that that like, it feels good. It's not even about speeding, you know, like have you ever driven one of those really old porsches and I was like 19 seventies, like 69, 70, 71. It was really tiny little mechanical things. they have the engine in the back. It's all screwy. It hit too much gas. He goes side with, but they only have like 150 horsepower. They're not heavy. The reallY light, but you feel everything in that thing and you get out. Even if you're going 40 miles an hour, you get out of the car with a big smile on your face. Like that was fucking cool. There's some, we've lost something. It takes a lot more to get us to that feeling in like some crazy technological marvel like alexa.

Speaker 8:          02:25:15       Yes. Yeah. I think it's more like you're, you feel lIke you're, you're actually doing something in the cars, not just driving for you. You know what I mean? Yeah. You're, yeah, exactly.

Speaker 7:          02:25:24       Moving it along this car. I mean, I don't even know what someone's buttons do and they're just like, yeah. When you find out about traction control and stability control and like they literally, they're going around a corner. If one wheel starts spinning, they'll hit, they'll apply brakes to it and like only break one wheel and turned the car this way to try to balance it out. It'll turn you out a fishtails yeah, it's amazing. Especially that gtr gtr is incredible for that. Like all the guys who review it, they, you know, they'll joke around about taking on a race track, just trying to throw it into the corners and the car just figures out how to do it and corrects itself. Which is really smart. You don't want some asshole in some 1970 porsche. That's gonna fucking kick out sideways on him. EverY time he goes around a corner and gives it the gas. You don't want that. You want that asshole to drive the gtr. But then in order for him to get his asshole kicks, he's got to go a lot faster. You got to go a lot faster. One 40, you've got to hit that gas, feel, that fucking thing.

Speaker 7:          02:26:21       Oh, I just had my. I'm leaving my car out here because it kind of sticks out there, you know, so I drive my roommate's car and it's just such a treat to get back here and drive this thing. What kind of cars? I thought, oh my roommates or my room as his was like a corolla. I'm like a 92. I think somewhere around there. You don't want to drive his fucking car while I do out there because it's getting a push. They do that in Mexico. Mexico. Yeah. That's a good move because I don't want to attract attention to that. Yeah. Oh, I see what you're saying. I thought you meant like here and. yeah. I was like, hmm. People love my scars here. No, here is fine. Yeah, I'm in Mexico. Like if you have like a mercedes or you a target. Yeah, I think they say the guy that was helping me move in, like the landlord was like, hey, you can take your car here.

Speaker 7:          02:27:06       There's, there's mercedes. And so he's such a. I saw like one mercedes in the garage. And was he sweating? The one who's just fucking would be looking around the corner. Look, I'm looked at everyone's stairs whenever, wherever I go in Mexico. So I would just imagine how it would be if they saw a spaceship. So how often do you go out? You said you don't really leave the resort. How often do you mean grocery? Grocery shopping. Like, oh, you want to leave to go grocery shopping, but that's just highway and then grocery store and then highway back. It's not that bad to go there and there's dudes with arrows and machine guns and shit and. Oh yeah, they have w. There's guys with machine guns all over the place. The police? Yeah. Oh yeah, they just carry around machine. I was like, it's no big deal.

Speaker 7:          02:27:44       It's crazy. That is different. Would be the case? No, they clamPed down a bit. From what I understand. Um, it's more of a, it's more police now than it was a little while ago. Well, like when I first started going, the first time I went to Mexico I think was pre 2000 I think. I think I might've went. No, it was when I was on mtv, I was on this thing for fear factor and we did it, so it must have been like 2001 or 2002. It was pretty much safe. Yeah, it's pretty normal. It's pretty safe. I think a lot of the things that they show here, just like the worst of the worst and it's like you can find that anywhere. Right. You know, look, there's murders here too.

Speaker 1:          02:28:22       You know what I mean? It's just, they're not publicized as much as they are. It's hard to get the video. The video of those guys put out with their fucking crazy narco music over it. When I show people getting machine gun shit, they have that. oh, there's some videos of them chopping people up with chainsaws. yeah, they've done a really mean shit. It's really not. That's not, that's not very nice. Yeah. We got to figure out how to fix that problem. Everybody's worrIed about Iraq and Afghanistan. We live next to one of the craziest spots on earth. Look, they can't get clean water, man. It's crazy. We got to go out and refill our water. We can't use the water in the sink. Really can do the mexicans use it. Yeah, but you get sick for a long time if you do it, but eventually you get used to it, which I mean develops a good bacteria.

Speaker 1:          02:29:05       It goes back to that fecal transplants. Shit. Well you need to do is get a mexican dude shit and your butt and uh, his fecal matter will balance out your ecosystem. I'll look into that. That's a real thing, man. When we were talking about earlier, yeah, I, I actually googled it and it's called a, they call it fecal microbiota transplantation, also known as a stool transplants process of transporting fecal bacteria from a healthy individual into a recipient as a treatment for patients suffering for them from a cdi, which is a, which produces effects ranging from diarrhea to a pseudo membrane. Ious colitis. Colitis is not good. Anytime someone says he got colitis. Previous terms for the procedure include fecal bacteriotherapy, fecal transfusion. Fecal transplant, huh? Wow. They wIll involve restoration of the colonic flora by introducing healtHy bacterial flora through an infusion of stool. People just eat better.

Speaker 1:          02:30:06       Well, the fact that someone came up with this idea, yeah, who, who, someone's pretty mixed in there one day and just saying, I wonder if we can put poop in someone else's buttons, fix their. Well, they're starting to understand so much more when it comes to bacteria and healthy bacteria and they're starting to understand that it, it affects mood. It's affects behavior, it affects so much and it wards off diseases and improves your immune system and actually some bacteria aggressively fights off colds and aggressively fights off when you come into contact with a certain different, you know, nasty things that they can actually be like having troops and your body does. Don't, don't viruses just mutate and come back stronger though. Well, they couldn't. If you don't take your fucking men's do all 10 days. If you're one of those bitches like doug stanhope who openly admitted on the podcast that he contributed to the creation of a super aids by not taking his fucking full z-pak. Yeah. He's one of those dudes. I have felt better. I stopped tagging it. So, uh, so if somebody tries to tell you that, that they took that your shit is so good that you took it out and put it in someone's body and it healed them, you know, the guy might not be lying. Sounds like

Speaker 7:          02:31:20       he'd be a bullshit artist that does sound, no pun intended. So, um, how did you get involved with being a, like a sort of an expert on positive thinking or mental concentration? Or did you just get it by experimenting yourself? And tHen I met someone in a poker game a while ago in la. We were running a poker in la. Was it already should fear? No, and a guy's kind of taken me under his wing, kind of taught me the ways of life really. How much gay sex is involved in a lot. A lot. It seems. It seems like you've just given none. No. Um, you know, it's, it's been, it's just something I've always known in my life. Just there's, there's something I got to learn, you know, I got to learn about myself. I got to learn how to think, how to feel, how to, how to just be man. I mean there was a lot of time, like for example, with women, I would not talk to a woman for till I college. I was scared of rejection and one day I choose the music. Brian. Yeah.

Speaker 7:          02:32:23       We're gonna. We're gonna. Need you to repeat this story? Okay. So what you were saying basically that there was one really big breakup. Yes. It's one really big, crazy heart wrenching breakup. It wasn't really that big though. Okay. For the story. Okay. For this store. Oh, that's right. For the hulk music while I'm trying to stall while brian pulls up the hold music. the internet here sucks it. Hmm. Shocker. Anyway, go ahead and tell us your story. No, look, I wouldn't even go up to a woman because I was scared of rejection and one day I was sitting there, I was like, why am I scared of this rejection? And I thought to myself like, if I don't go up, it's a no right every time. And if you just close your eyes and jerk off in the bathroom, it's a yes every time. It's like you pretended to actually happen and then you can talk to where without needing something, without being such a needy bitch, and you probably wind up being more successful.

Speaker 7:          02:33:21       Well look, that's one of the things I've learned is like everything is created By yourself. You're as confident as you believe you can be as weak as you believe you are. I saw your twitter. It was really funny. Yeah, I do. Um, text message you the wrong person. And so he, uh, he text messaged me, hey, you got the wrong number and this is matt and hey, by the way, girls don't like it when you need it. Exactly. Well, he texted, he texted me three times within an hour and I was sitting there playing poker and I was just like, man, stop annoying me. And I was like, you know what? No, I'm just going to help this guy out. Listen, you cannot text the girl three times. She's done with you after the second text probably. Yeah. Even the second text you've given up your cards, you know, what are you doing?

Speaker 7:          02:34:02       But unless you're just having fun and not have to worry about anything, you're not actually playing a game of trying to catch the pussy. Yeah. You know, if you could be friends and you could send three text to a friend. Sure. But let's be realistic trying to get some blue cards. It's the same as poker. Right? You get crazy. You throw all your money on the table and you're fucked. Yeah. Requires discipline. Well, in the big, in the beginning I went broke three times. Broke, like sucking dicks on the street. No, well, I mean I was still living with my parents so it wasn't that bad. But you were living with your parents and he went broke. No, no, no. I mean, wait, hold on. Let me think about. It is a long time ago. If you'Re going to make up a story, have it made up.

Speaker 7:          02:34:41       Okay. I don't want to hear you crazy. Fake going broke with your parents. I went broke when I was in college in college, so like when I was in, I went to plattsburgh, upstate New York and I went broke like three times during that period I went broke with my student loan first. Oh jesus. So like, and then I, I made six grand back and I went to vegas and I made, I made some money, but I was like trying to be that cool guy going to clubs and spending all this money and I went home with like 200 bucks every time I went broke I rebounded within a week and I got back. I had a 9,000 score. Right. So you have been addicted to playing poker for a long fucking time. You're talking about like, I wouldn't say dictate the wrong terminology. You been, uh, an extreme enthusiasts of, of competitive poker.

Speaker 7:          02:35:31       Yeah. Well, the way it went was the first year I learned how to play. I was playing eight hours a day, seven days a week. You just got obsessed. That's the way I am when I do something and I really put my mind to it. I want to be the best. There's just no stopping. So, and it, with poker it's much like with a lot of other disciplines, there's so much you can learn that it becomes really exciting. Like the more you know more effort and focus, you Put on it, the more you read about it, the more you improve and you see that improvement. It's very stimulating, you know, it is. And, and the great thing about poker, the I love is it's always new, new things always. You can pick up something new every time you play. And that's why I love it because it keeps me learning new things every day and, and growing as a poker player, you know, as a personal that stuff.

Speaker 7:          02:36:16       Well it seems like it'd be a fun way to make a living too, as long as you're actually successful. But that one year you said you had like one year they did it last year. Data a soccer bag one. Yeah. Well, most of the reason was because I lost my online income because of the black friday poker being coming illegal so I couldn't play on line, so I was just spending money without making it. So. Is that why you moved to Mexico? partially, yeah. Make more money. Do you find yourself a little. Can you read it down there that knows how to speak spanish and get you out of a jam? No, no, I haven't. I don't. I can't speak spanish at all. You live in, in spanish, you can't speak spanish. Most of them are part of the problem. Most of the big restaUrants and stuFf speak english, so I never really had the better. We're right next door. We've got the Cash. Exactly. You got the guns now. They got the guns now. We sold them a lot of guns. A lot of guns. Man. That was one of the dumbest ideas in the history of the human race. Was that operation fast and furious. You know, that is when the dea decided to. We've got to find out where there's mexicans do with these guns, sell them a bunch of guns, track them.

Speaker 3:          02:37:16       So they sold them like thousands of guns. Scroll the operation fast and furious. Yeah, it's a real. And then some of those guns were actually used to kill a us border patrol agent like that is easily one of the dumbest ideas in the history of the. Or one of the most clever ruses for. Oh, I was just so stupid. I didn't even know you can't sell guns. Whips. Sorry. I won't happen again. I was actually working for the good guys. And now selling the bad guys guns. Yeah, I figured we'd Just watch who they shoot and then we have them. You get it. We have about 2000 guns over there. No worries. It's no big deal in guns are illegal over there in Mexico. All guns? No. We'll illegal to own as as a citizen. Like what about rifles? Like hunting rifles. I don't know about that.

Speaker 3:          02:38:01       I think that would be a gun, right? I mean that's stupid. How are you supposed to kill your food? You don't have to. Everybody has to rely on someone else to kill it for them. Apparently beans are already dead, bro. They're alive. You got to pick them, bitch trying to out there. MaYbe you do. But um, yeah, it's, it's, it's real interesting living out there, man. It's, it's a new world. So You moved there just to specifically to get around this law? Yeah. ARe you in trouble like saying that? Can you say. Oh no, no, no, no. It's legal to play there. Oh, it is? Yeah. It's legal. Is it legal? So you can say, like if someone says, hey, Why are you living in Mexico? You can say, look, I'm a professional poker player. That's how I make my living. You paid taxes in America on those ill gotten gains.

Speaker 3:          02:38:39       Yeah. That's illegal. And how is that not illegal? It's, I don't know. It's where the actual house that you sleep in is settled in. that's what's important. What line of the dirt isn't on? yup. if it's on here, you can go to jail. If it's on here, they'll take your tax dollars. That's how it is. You get shit for going back and forth like the border guys look at you. Funny. Not really. I mean I just say them there to surf and relaxed. Which is true. Do you sit? Does it say that you're a, that you live like on you looking at your passport, does it say you live in Mexico? No, a United States passport. Yeah. So what do you say? Just say I have a vacation home down there. I just say vacationing. Yeah. And you know, it's not really a deal, a big deal when you come into the us, but when you go into Mexico you don't want to say that.

Speaker 3:          02:39:23       What's the deal with Canada? Can you do that in Canada? You could do in Canada. Yeah. You chose Mexico or Canada? Yeah, like the beach dude. True. That's true. I guess dc. Those photos of a. Kevin perry was in cabo and then photos he sent either tweeting. It's just looks so beautiful. So gorgeous. It was fucking gorgeous. however you might get shot Canada. Canadians are way nicer. Yeah, absolutely. I thought about it, you know, but I just want to go somewhere and make a bunch of money and come back and live now. Do you, when you have a professional poker player, like what's the longterm goal? Do you like? You try to be the best, try to like stockpile enough money away so that you can get through a bad year. Yeah, yeah. Well, for example, I bought a house last year, you know, um, I just try to, I have some money with a financial advisor. I have some money in my bank, you know, I just try to diversify

Speaker 7:          02:40:14       because there are going to be rainy days where you don't make money. so, you know, I was fortunate that I was able to make enough to not have to really worry about it when black friday hit and you know, I could, I could live. it's funny that eVerybody calls it in the poker community friday, black friday, black friday. Is there, is there any work being done and try to fix that. Yeah, that's going on I would say about a year until it's legalized. But the problem lies, the problem now is that they want to do it state to state where you're not gonna be able to play with the whole world. So you're going to have. It's not going to be able to make as much money as you could, you know, just to play against californians. But that's the job bitches. That's true. That's true. On a, on sunday they have a $200 buy in, which gets about 4,000 players.

Speaker 7:          02:40:54       You can win a quarter of a million dollars. Where's this? It's online. Jesus. pokerstars. And you can't play it if you live in America. Correct. To try to go. Could you go through a proxy or as you could but then like a pierogi but not as tasty. You could. Yeah, you could. But I wouldn't say. I mean, I wouldn't suggest it, you know, because if they catch you, I don't know what they would do. So it probably arrest you. Right? I don't know. Well that's what I said. The law with poker is it's so new that they don't really have anything set in place. So they could probably take your money. Probably. Isn't that funny? They can't take it. If you do it in Mexico, even though you're paying them the taxes on that. If you do that, that's one of the worst part of it. Please is that, well finally they just remedy this, but for a bunch of years you couldn't carry over losses.

Speaker 7:          02:41:35       So let's say you made 100 k one year, but then the next year he lost 40 and they're not giving you any of the 100 back. So it's hard to survive sometimes. Will that just makes sense. I mean it's just based on a yearly thing. Yeah. Do you think that you'd be able to. Well, because like for example, if you're a doctor you're making around the same each year, but if you're a poker player you can lose some, some urine, you know, now you can carry over though. They let you now carry over. Oh, you do now you can as the last. Within the last year I believe. Oh, that's interesting. I should say I was told this by somebody, the same guy that told brian that dolphins have, but no, this was a cpa, so I'm hoping it's right or else I'm screwed. He's a producer. There are distributors of disinformation.

Speaker 7:          02:42:20       Make sure you check. Yeah, I should check the same. You never know man. You're right. It might be fucking with you. It's true. Next thing you know, you're trying to claim some shit and he's trying to get you locked up. Maybe he's deep inside. He's working from the inside like that show homeland and I'm talking about. I haven't seen it yet. I've been told to watch that though. It's good man. So, um, you said you worked with camp men and you work with commonly? Yes. You work with conference last five franklin. So. Well actually I worked with him for his last fight before that, against more extensively for the other fight. We talked once. Oh, so we didn't. It's sort of like still in its infancy stages. Are you planning on doing this as a business? I want to know what would you do? Just make different programs based on different guys and how just play it by ear and try to figure out how what we can do to fix them. Yeah, I mean, well, the thing is, like I said, it differs so much from person

Speaker 3:          02:43:11       to person so you can have kind of an idea of where you're going, but how you get there is going to be different based on everybody else and what they're. What's going on in their head. That's pretty cool, dude. You know, you're obviously a guy who's a sort of figured out in life that you can carve your own path. You know, you don't have. You're not living, you're living in fucking Mexico. First of all, that's be a big hand professional poker player and I'm just going to go mentally coach fighters. Yeah. Well, I mean that's, that's the fun way to live life I think. Oh fuck. Yeah. Without a doubt. I think it's so important for people to hear that people like you are doing that too because so many people think that life is just this sort of mundane series of events that you've been thrown into and there's no way to get out of it and you're going to be stuck doing something.

Speaker 3:          02:43:55       This, You know, along these lines for the rest of your life. Like you can do anything you want, and I know it sounds corny, but one day I literally woke up and said, you know what? I want to work with them. May flyers and I, and I Took action. You know, that's the best. The one thing I think that most people are lacking. They can think of great things they want to do, but as far as action goes, a lot of people are waiting for someone else to come along and help them. You know? That's why it's one of the most annoying things I bet you must get this, is people that have requests for you to help them start a business or requests for you to help them. Do you get that kInd of investor? You mean as an investor? I've been burned a couple of times.

Speaker 3:          02:44:31       I don't do it anymore. You can't. You've got to figure out your own pants on, you know, and coming up to someone and say, listen, if you took this and brought it to a producer, like, ah, I got my own things to worry about. You've got to find your own way. Don't, don't try to get a bunch of people to fucking make your business by donating money and stop fap. You need to set up a structure that you need to just set up a structure for how you're going to get to where you want to get, and that's the only way to do it. There's a lot of fucking people that want other people to help them. I get requests like that. Can you teach me how to play poker? That seems easy. It's like, do you realize how much time it takes to get good at poker?

Speaker 3:          02:45:05       I asked them that. I say, do you understand that you're going to have to be completely immersed in it for a year or two. Can you do that with your time? Eight hours a day? Good luck, and if you don't, you're gonna lose. Exactly. So he never be a fucking professional. God dammit. It's verY important though, do to have guys like you to have a conversation with someone who's living a life that seems like a crazy life. Like you know, like, wow, that guy figured that out. How that to do that, it's so important for normal folks too. To hear stuff like your story. Like if I was 18 and I heard your story, it would be great for me because I'd be like, oh, okay, well that's possible too. Like maybe you don't have to do this job. Like maybe I should figure out if I could be a poker player.

Speaker 3:          02:45:45       That guy seems cool. He's having a good time. Like just the idea. Just put the idea of you being able to accomplish things that are unusual. Things you don't see around you. It's not easy. It takes work and that's why most people I don't think do it because it takes a lot of work, man. It takes a lot of work to do anything to do any of you to be an mma fighter, to be a poker player and anything and everything. That's sort of the key to life. Find something that you really love to do and just go fucking crazy with it

Speaker 8:          02:46:14       and the key is to not be stopped because you're going to hit road bumps and some people will just say, okay, well I'll try something new, but you know, I hit road bumps in poker too when I'm broke, you know, you didn't. I thought about quitting every time, you know, and I just said, you know what, I'm just going to get better. And I actually with the way I did it was I messages the top 10 ranked poker players online. That's how I did it. I said, listen, I'm looking to get good. Will you take five minutes out of your day to talk to me? And three of them said, yes, those are suckers. Those guys screwed up. Sudden let this guy in nice take all your fucking money. What have you come in second place in you, you, you come in first place. And he comes in second and he's like, what the fuck? Yeah, you certainly can't do it with a large group of people, but I definitely try to take like three or four people under my wing, you know, at a time. That's cool man. I think it's important to know brian under your wing. I've been life cooked so much this week from sore. I can't even say.

Speaker 8:          02:47:06       And with that, ladies and gentlemen, thanks. Once again. Anybody

Speaker 3:          02:47:11       who bought my special, my comedy special online, if you go to joe rogan.net live from the tabernacle, I couldn't come up with another name. I was trying to figure out what another name would be, but it just never came to me and I didn't think it was important. So it's live from the tabernacle because I filmed it at the tabernacle theater in atlanta, Georgia. And uh, I think you could play this music. It distracts me and it makes me confused.

And that's what I did. I paid for the entire filming of it all. Um, hired like a real director and my friend anthony and his big company, positive image video to do a great professional job on it.

Yeah, so basically there's, the way I did it was, um, I did uh, like different facets of the game, like I'm three betting you probably won't understand the terms with three different things of poker and I did three people to do their opinion on it. So you could choose whIch one you like or incorporate whatever you like into. Mostly it's just one person writing about it, like they know it to be fact.
