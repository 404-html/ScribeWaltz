Speaker 1:          00:00          The Joe Rogan experience, either way, the, the, the, the important thing is that like seeing those, those images on those shows where they're repeating over and over and over again. They have all these graphic images of bodies and pulling things out of bodies and it's like, it's pretty intense that you're, you're taking that stuff into your psyche. You're taking that stuff into your, your bank of experiences. I don't like sexual stuff on television early. He believed that. You mean like girls making out or like let's say I'm watching Diane Sawyer and have like a condom commercial. I'll lose my mind. A condom commercial will bother you. Oh, because little kids really destroyed tampon. Commercial. I want to choke myself and my wife was in the room. Are like your rants in the room with some older woman since I was a kid. KOTEX commercial. I would sit down and look straight ahead.

Speaker 1:          00:45          I never get so embarrassed in my life. I don't want them to ask me if I know and I don't want to fucking know the blood comes out of this match what you put up there. That's got to do it. But I'm just that don't even bring it up. You know, there's some women that cute. They think it's cute. Like, hold on, I gotta go. We gotta Tampon. Listen, I don't want to know. I want to love you. Bleed. You just ruined everything for me. I guess. I don't want to know. That's not really bothers me. That bothers me. The sight of blood. No, no, no, no, no, no. Decided talking about that. You fucking pussies bleeding around me. That's what I fucking hate when even when they haven't been purse. I get sick to my stomach. I want to see a fucking tampon. I don't want to fucking see a Tampon at all.

Speaker 1:          01:28          Alright. Right. When I'm watching TV and a tampon commercial comes up. Even when I'm by myself. I feel creepy. That's so weird. Condom commercials. That new commercial with a chicken head popping out on the fucking thing with you. Put on your finger. Have you seen that fucking commercial chick with the creepy finger? You to relieve stress. You know what meant? I don't want to know about that shit. Play to walk the fuck is that Zombie? Oh my God. That is to put that away. That's broken. That one's broken. That is just. That means I didn't get that one fixed. So this day, anything back, a little sprays, anything bad and television. 10 o'clock drives me up the fucking wall.

Speaker 2:          02:12          The reason I know this and I want to do a shameless plug. My Buddy Ben Wallace has this great book, the billionaire's vinegar, and it's about the most expensive bottle of wine ever sold, but like what is good wine? Do we know good wine when we taste? It's fascinating.

Speaker 1:          02:25          Well, if you get really old shit, most likely it's not good anymore.

Speaker 2:          02:28          Well the problem is, as his book explains is the problem is no one. This is a bottle. The most expensive bottle of wine. Every soul wound up being fraudulent, but it was purported to be owned by Thomas Jefferson. Okay. So for like Steve Forbes zoned for awhile and all these different guys on this bottle line, one of the Koch brothers don't want it for a while and in the end there's no one around who can go. I've had a lot of wine from that year.

Speaker 1:          02:55          Spray down the money. Isn't crazy though that

Speaker 2:          03:00          these different rich guys had the wine and sold it to each other, like they passed it on Forbes, stored in a, put it in a in their corporate headquarters and they had an a box, like a glass lift boxes of decoration, but they hadn't standing upright with a heat lamp in there or dried that cork out and the felt in the bottle. So later when people were trying to analyze what was in it, there can never rule out the intrusion of foreign substances which will not allow them to find out what it was. The guy they eventually like is why the guy who created the hoax would take really good wine and do weird stuff to it. Like you'd put a little bit of vanilla extract in here or he'd put some dirt from his gutter in. They're just weird things he could do to kind of throw people and then guys that are like big swinging dicks about wine, we're tasting. They'd be like, Oh yeah, I got it. It's a brilliant book, man.

Speaker 1:          03:58          Okay. Here's a serious question. Is there a guy that has ever existed that has a full suit of armor in his house that isn't a douchebag?

Speaker 2:          04:07          Nope. Well, I mean, comic book collector guys aren't really Douche bags, you know, they like that shit. You know, like they have like a real suit of armor in their house. I've almost bought at an armored helmet the other day. I saw helmets. Helmets are Kinda dope. Yeah. I almost bought one of those so I could see it. I would say last case I would say, uh, the same can be said about those dime store Indians. The cigar store Indian or the black jockeys that you put on your lawn. Oh, that's rude. How about people who have like little gremlins and shit on there? The elves are those, what are they? Yeah, my step Mama House east on her front porch today. If it starts to rain, she puts her raincoat on it and then if it's like halloween she dresses up in a little costume. Was like this big ceramic geese. And then I, I was, I always make fun of it. And then somebody came, broke it recently and she was so sad about it. So now she has all these stupid geese outfits and she can't find another one of them. So are you kidding me?

Speaker 2:          05:10          Ceramic.

Speaker 1:          05:11          Geez. What happened today? It was the worst day of my life. Someone cracked my ceramic birds. I had that one that I leave. It makes me so happy. I come home, I see my ceramic duck.

Speaker 2:          05:28          I got him into Toronto World Fairy Sixty two. It's x and they don't make them that much anymore. He's beauty.

Speaker 1:          05:38          He defined my yard.

Speaker 2:          05:41          I swear you to look at me.

Speaker 1:          05:44          He was my friend. I know that sounds retarded. I don't care. He was my friend.

Speaker 2:          05:51          Ever since he left. Ever since Jimmy left, he's gone.

Speaker 1:          05:56          Ever since gone. A

Speaker 3:          05:57          house is haunted. Gone. I feel a little crazy. I can't sleep at night because I feel like I failed him and he's going to kill me in my sleep. I should've. I should've gotten them a coat of armor. It was my little chally. I had a name for room charlie the duck and now he's dead. I had illustrated books I made about him over the years. He's gonna come back and kill those punks that broke them. That's fucking Rad. Isn't a Stephen King movie about a fucking evil ceramic duck. Some kids break. It goes out and cuts their throat and their sleep. Just imagine that you're waking up in a giant ceramic Daca just trying to throw it out. Oh, I can. I'm never going to get tired of seeing the neighborhood punks get beat up for doing something wrong somehow. You love that story

Speaker 1:          07:19          recording. Oh, it is already. What the fuck son?
