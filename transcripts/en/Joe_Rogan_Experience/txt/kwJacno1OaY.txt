Speaker 1:          00:00          The joe rogan experience podcast my night day.

Speaker 2:          00:08          It's uh, it gets real tricky when someone does denies the rights of citizens than someone who's empowered. Denies the rights because w what are you then, if you're in power and you're denying the rights, as soon as you step in and deny people do processed, deny people lawyers to die people, why would you ever want to do that? It's a real question. So when things get passed, like the National Defense Authorization Act allows the government to indefinitely detained American civilians and they don't have to do anything. They're not required to notify your family. They're not required to arrest you. They're not required to. You don't, you can't, you don't have to get a lawyer. They can just lock you up when you see shit like that. Does that drive you crazy?

Speaker 3:          00:51          Oh yeah. And people always say to me, they say, well, you know, why are you defending the terrorist? And what you try to explain to people is without the due process, there's no confirmation that this is a terrorist. The only way you know it's a terrorist is when some court somewhere determines upon looking at the evidence that this person is a terrorist. Once you can kill somebody on the suspicion of being a terrorist, well, we're all under suspicion of terrorist under the certain conditions that someone wants to deem a mistaken identity situation. You know? Or I mean how many, how many guys are named Omar or Mohammad or you know what I mean?

Speaker 2:          01:24          Well, how about in this dorm or case the, the cop shot up two different cars that were the wrong cards. Perfect example. Perfect example. You the, the idea that the government should have special powers that regular human beings don't. That's crazy.

Speaker 3:          01:39          Well, they have that now. I mean, I think they already do because

Speaker 2:          01:42          sure. Take it to the next level and decide that you're going to deny the rights of people that you feel are guilty. Well, who are you and how do I know that you're infallible and how do I know that this isn't corruption? How do I know this isn't a personal grudge? It's not like you're dealing with an organization that has a spotless record over the past, you know, 200 years where they're the most ethical human beings to ever exist. And people from other countries come to them for, no, we've caught them a lie, but $1 million.

Speaker 3:          02:08          Oh, you had could. We had a committee hearings, which you cannot even imagine today, which shows you how much things have changed. In the 1970s we had the church committee hearings in the Pike Committee hearings where the government actually on television exposed everything the CIA had been doing since the end of the Second World War. The assassinations and all this kind of stuff. The crown jewels are what the CIA used to call those secrets that were exposed on television by congressional and senatorial committees. It just shows you what happens when there's no oversight and if stuff is too secret to have oversight over, you're asking for trouble. There's too many ways human beings can justify going beyond the rules, and there's always a good reason and you hear it today. I mean, the waterboarding thing. As a perfect example, we prosecuted people at Nuremberg for having an attitude that we have now, which is, hey, if they're terrorists and you can save lives by torturing people. Isn't that an ethical dilemma where it's worth torturing some guy, you know, is bad anyway in order to save lives. I mean, if you could have prevented the two towers from falling down by waterboarding, a couple of bad guys, isn't that worth it? And that those ethical dilemmas lead you off into the weeds really quickly. And history shows that over and over again.

Speaker 2:          03:18          It's, it's very doubtful that it's helping either. It's very doubtful that you're really getting that kind of key information from people by throwing water down their mouth. You know, I don't, I just, I don't, I don't know if if torturing people gets them to tell the truth,

Speaker 3:          03:32          gets him to tell you anything you want. There's an old line about, would you, and I wish I could quote it at length. It's a wonderful line going back hundreds of years where somebody says, would you abrogate the laws in order to get the devil? And the other guy says, no, I would, I would stick to the laws because if, if you abrogate the laws to get to the devil, you take away the only thing that protects yourself eventually. And that's what this is. People say, well, it's okay to go after this to get to terrorists. What makes you think one that it'll stay with terrorists and to that what a terrorist is, that definition won't change. The Bush administration was calling these people that would light, you know, car dealerships on fire in the middle of the night when there was no one there. Ecoterrorists you're going to drone those people, right?

Speaker 2:          04:12          When are you going to do exactly where does the line get drawn and who gets to the

Speaker 3:          04:15          antifungal coffee proponents that might get a little hyped up, but those motherfuckers grown those people. I mean do this whole fucking pope thing. To me it's crazy, crazy and hilarious that we even pay attention to what that clown is doing. How is that even making the news? There's some weird fucking group of people who do like the most bizarre ceremonies who I, I don't sanctioned sanctioned

Speaker 2:          04:38          governments and mass media. No one calls it a call. The guy's wearing a fucking wizard out yet with a fish head hat. It's if you tried to do that today and tried to say, I am a Dorn of God. He has brought to me this information. He tried, you set up a shop, they would think you are a fucking loon. But because of the fact that it's been around for a long time, this guy has a direct lineage. We're supposed to take it serious.

Speaker 3:          04:59          We're supposed to take it seriously and we're supposed to fucking ignore all the Shit Catholicism did. Well, how about this shit here

Speaker 2:          05:05          did he released a priest that had molested 200 deaf boys, 200 he let them go, Huh? He let them go, brought him into psychiatric instead of bringing in and getting them prosecuted. They brought him in for psychiatric treatment and this guy went on to, they went to another parish and molested more voice. I mean, it's fucking craziness. He did that time and time again. He took people away from being prosecuted and sent him to psychiatric care and and they're free. They're free to go. They're free. They're walking around the streets. Some of them are in these huge religious retreat places that they have beautiful grounds and these guys are just wandering around taking care of for the rest of their lives and the trauma.

Speaker 3:          05:44          There's a place like that up by where I live. Where? Yeah, there that. Yeah. So right. So that's happening and they don't pay taxes. They don't pay fucking taxes. That is is

Speaker 2:          05:53          fucking crazy. All that shit is crazy. The idea that they should be able to make golden buildings and not pay taxes. Bitch, are you out of your fucking mind? Can you fucking imagine that's a business. It's a business. It's a fucking business. You're not. No. You don't talk directly directly for God. It's 2013 stop. Stop your bullshit. You're not telling the truth. You don't know that much. I don't believe you. I think you are very charismatic and there's a lot of people that want to believe you and they'll go along with it. But you're talking crazy to God's not talking to you stupid. No, you're an asshole. You're an asshole and you, you'd taken their money. And we've got to make sure that this stops with our generation. We've got to make sure that future generations don't, they don't have a gigantic religious leader. Someone who tells them based on some nutty shit that was written thousands of years ago by people drew on animal skins. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          06:47          So it also, it spreads that the way that looks with Catholicism is just one version of the problem. The other problem is the guy who calls, you know, there's like an, in the way there was a pope, there's also a dude who calls himself the president, but instead of representing some phantasmo forest called God, he says, I represent the will of the people. Yet he doesn't really represent the well of the people. It doesn't seem like that when he goes to when, when, when they do the polls and that fine as it turns out, you know, and I'm not just the present, of course the government as a whole, the president doesn't have to tell Alterian power, but I don't think that the president really represents the will of the people. And I don't think Congress represents the will of the people. And I don't think Senate represents the will of the people any more than the pope represents the will of God.

Speaker 3:          07:32          And I think it's this, this imaginary thing that we're supposed to believe in because it makes us feel more comfortable as those, these people are really enacting the will of the people. I think the will of the people is a, that we want peace. We want to be able to, like we, we do want security, we want education, but we don't want fucking war with Iran. Yeah, we don't want fucking war with Iraq, Iraq, Iraq. How the fuck do you say? And I forget to say that I got, so start up, we don't want it. Nobody wants war. And if there is, it's a small faction of people, sweaty red face. Cocksuckers

Speaker 2:          08:06          did you guys, I was going to bring this up yesterday. Did you guys hear about this guy who got arrested with a hundred bags of heroin up his ass? No hundred bags. Hundred bags. It was a traffic stop. This his ass hauled him is brutal.

Speaker 3:          08:21          Ah, you have a sinkhole

Speaker 2:          08:24          sir? It's a hundred bags of heroin, man. That's the man. Oh, oh Jesus. Okay. I, I look, I look this killa season. No, no, this one. Okay. This guy just had one. Okay, let's get the other guy had it. His ass. One guy just had 200 bags. I'm like, did someone just take it to the next level? You gotta you gotta Watch Killa season. So this dude gets busted on the palisades parkway. They pull him over and his 2005 Mitsubishi Lancer and he's acting real weird. And um, so they decided to bring him in. So they bring him in and they opened up his ass. They just gave him a cavity check. I mean the guy didn't do anything wrong and they pulled him over. He just looked weird. He was tweaking out on his own. Something was going on with the man. He was pulled over.

Speaker 2:          09:14          I mean, routine traffic stop. But they, they detected the smell of marijuana and that's where they, uh, that's where they got them and they brought him in because they smelled marijuana. That's it. And he had a hundred bags of heroin up his ass. And you can't put a hundred bags of heroin up your ass while the cops are going from their car to your car. You can't do that. So he was driving around with those packed up. Is that, why would you drive around and smoke weed with a hundred packs of heroin in your ass? Well, I think he's just one of those guys. That's his move.

Speaker 4:          09:47          Maybe it's like,

Speaker 2:          09:49          like Russian chicks would put ben Wa balls and their pussy to tighten up their must. They're fuck muscle. Maybe this dude was just like exercise and his, his ass story. Starfish, starfish. Maybe he didn't trust his roommate's like, man, if I leave, this is a hundred bags of heroin.

Speaker 4:          10:03          Well these motherfuckers to get itself. He went to the gym. He's like, man, I can't fit it in my pocket. I can't leave. I can't leave it in my dash. Let's work on that star fish.

Speaker 2:          10:15          The glove box is full. Hmm.

Speaker 4:          10:19          Maybe I just stuffed this up my ass. Hmm. Can I fit a hundred bags? Well, let's see. Five, six. Wow. Am I really going to get 94?

Speaker 2:          10:31          Dr. Steven Greer, if you don't know who Dr. Greer is, there's a thing that a lot of people are aware of that came out was at 20 2011, the disclosure project, was it 2001 2011. I met one I meant right around September 11th, and that's where the 11 came from my head. Um, 2001, uh, it was a huge, uh, in the Internet, a huge point of controversy and a, a topic of conversation. It was you, uh, on stage introducing this disclosure project, explaining how much information, uh, you had, uh, access to about alien spacecrafts visiting earth and how many distinguished high ranking military people. And that was where it got shocking, uh, agreed with you. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          11:17          And, yeah, one of the interesting thing, after we put this briefing together for Clinton and, uh, you know, Laurance Rockefeller, uh, I put the concept together, the best available evidence and all these cases, and then Lawrence Rockefeller hosted a bill and Hillary Clinton at the Rockefeller ranch, and that it had me out there shortly before that. And Mr Rockefeller was the white hat in the family who wanted to end the secrecy, unlike some of his, his family. Uh, and, and he, so he said to me one night, I was at on, on his porch, on a deck in the grand tetons at the [inaudible] ranch, and, and he said, uh, we really need you to hurry up and do this. And I said, Oh, Lawrence, I'm just a doctor in North Carolina. I'm working in an er, you know, he says, no, no, you have to do it. I said, no, Lawrence, you have to get these guys to do.

Speaker 5:          12:07          He says, they will never do it. And I said, Lawrence, for God's sakes, you're old, you're rich and you're rockefeller. And he says, no. He says, the implications of this are so vast. And so profound that no aspect of life will be unchanged when it comes out. I said, yes, Lawrence, that's why it's secret. And then he said to me, well, that means those folks aren't going to do it. And then, you know, before that, as shortly after that, and I had this, um, meeting with the CIA director and, and, and one of the president's friends came to my house and this was a very disturbing story. I'm sitting at the table with my four kids, four daughters, and this man who's very close friends with the president, uh, Clinton says to me, um, well, you know, they're very supportive of what you've recommended in this white patriarch.

Speaker 5:          12:54          I said, great. And he says, but they're not going to do it. I said, why not? He says, they're convinced that if the president steps into this too hard, he'll end up like Jack Kennedy. And I started laughing, thinking, what a load of nonsense. And he stopped me. He says, no, they're serious. I said, well, don't say this in front of the kids. So we went to the library in my house, um, after dinner, and I said, what are you talking about Kevin? And he said, they really think this is too dangerous. I said, well, what am I supposed to do? What am I chop liver? And he looked at me and he says, yeah, you're expendable. So I've always viewed myself as the kind of the throwaway guy and all of this. I'm in the sense that these guys, you know, the, the folks who have enormous political power and corporate power, uh, even the ones who support this very avidly, and there's a lot of them, um, they don't want to stick their necks out, but I'm confused.

Speaker 5:          13:46          Okay. Why would they kill Bill Clinton if Bill Clinton came out and said that we may have evidence that there might be some intelligent life out there in the world or universe? She goes, you know, it's like the rem song. It's the end of the world as we know it. Because if that, if that happens when that happens, people would panic. No, no, no, no, no, no. The public isn't going to panic over this unless it's couched in a stupid way. Well, the public definitely will panic if the president comes out and says, Ufo is, and then he gets whacked. That would lead to panic. Yeah, but there's a bigger problem if the president doesn't have control access over these projects. He didn't want to talk about it because then it shows the fact that our democracy has been side lined as eisenhower warned us experience

Speaker 6:          14:32          [inaudible].
