So you get to read everything from really, you know, anytime anything happens, you know, science is really meet are really amazing. That bill burr was. I saw that like a 100 times whatever the quote was, the ridiculous close scientist science. Incredible. Something like that. I don't have his phone. I was trying, I was trying to get ahold of him because I wanted to get him and Carrie Santa Maria tonight together to do a podcast. He's around. I'll, I'll give you. I'll get you his number. Well, I'll ask him first. That's the proper thing. Do you not like it Brian County? When people give away your phone number and you get a phone call and it's like, blocked me. Pick it up at some goofball, one

Speaker 2:          00:01:10       to talk to you and you're like, Oh, when? When Jimmy Burke gave my number on your podcast, I got like 50, but it's all been really cool. I was like, look, don't you don't abuse my number? And they'd be talking like, what the fuck man? I was like, all right young guys. All right guys. I remember being used. So yeah, look, 99 point nine percent of all people are cool. I mean that sounds crazy but are out on the road when I, when I, when I want people to come some nights there, they helped me out in a car rental. I'll get my number, I'll go, just call me. I'll get to healthcare with free tickets. Not once. If I hadn't had anybody abuse it. Not, no.

Speaker 1:          00:01:45       Most people don't. Most people are cool about it, but I used to. I fucked up once and twittered my number. It's a whole difference I was trying to do. He did somebody else I forget. I was trying to send a buddy of mine my number when new number it was. I don't remember who I did is I fucked up instead of hitting the reply to a direct message, somehow know that was a tweet.

Speaker 2:          00:02:10       Yeah. I got a number from Jamaica and I was like, what is this? I got got to answer it and I swear to God I. I'm not exactly. I'm sure a lot of listeners have probably gotten this, but I probably hit. Everybody goes, yeah, yeah. Looking for a you, you've won a prize. Really terrible. I was like, I haven't because you won two point $5, million dollars. I just need some. I just need some, some tax money from you. One percent of that. Then you can have the money. Can I? Can I give you a tracking number? No. I was like, yes, and it gets me. I go and he goes, can you read it back to me? I read it back. Oh, this is exciting. I go, how much I want to get to a point. 5 million. Congratulations. How'd you feel? I feel amazing. This is incredible because all you have to do is just now we're going to have to. You have to pay the international tax, that's all it is. So just a while ago. So I only have to be one percent of two point $5. Million Dollars I think is $250,000,000.

Speaker 1:          00:03:00       Thousand Dollars. I don't know. I'm really nervous. I'm not sure, but that's all I got to do is know Justin fucked. I'm going to ask you for $25,000. How does that sound to you? I go, this is incredible. And it goes I. and then he gives me a bunch of other information and I'm like, I'm so excited. I just feel like, what did I do to get this? He goes, you ended that sweepstakes, the worst job in the world. Right? And finally I go, let me ask you a question, how long I should have it? I was, I was eating at a Pf Chang's. I was like, oh fucking dumb. Do you think he goes, Bob Claude? And he just hung up. He just swore then pot pot English. Well he's mad that he couldn't scam you, but I mean you got a little better at scamming then telling me.

Speaker 1:          00:03:42       I got a huge prize. What's incredible is that that works. I mean, it's incredible. I don't, I do not remember who was telling us, but someone had a friend that got Dan. I wish I remember who the hell it was, but anyway, he was saying that was it already? Was it already the total assist that he knew a dude that thought, I think it was already knew a dude that thought he won, you know, some crazy price like this because you got scammed by these Nigerian guys. And it started getting really cunty like, yeah, you guys wait, wait to see what I got common like. And they were like, oh my God, you were saying all this while you're getting scammed by these Nigerian Nigerians set up fake offices and a lot of them are lawyers and a lot of them are really educated and so I'll set up a fake. They weren't, they were swinging the Big Wall Street guys for a while. Oh my God, it's so crazy for cash, for cash because the Wall Street guy get greedy and say, you know, you want have to pay taxes on this, but they'd have these offices that have all set up. They have, it'd be with Nigerian oil company, a subsidiary, and there was a big article. Scotland Yard was all over these guys because. And the FBI because they wiped out. They really did a good job. They had some young guys who were traders give them $2,000,000.

Speaker 1:          00:04:55       This one guy mortgaged his house and he killed himself window that he a lot. Some people can just get. What they would do is they would give you money, they would give you. They do something like give you money and then you would give them legit money or something. Whatever it was. There were a lot of things to do and you'd get home with this money in some cases. I'm not remember the exact story, but the money was a fake die that would wear off like in the movies, you know, like it was a, some kind of a fake. I don't know. I have no idea, but it was just a. They realized that they were, they were, that, that had been scammed of a million dollars in jump out the window. Commercials are an unnecessary evil or a necessary evil. Unnecessary. You have to pay for bandwidth.

Speaker 1:          00:05:45       We're almost, we're almost at high speed bandwidth folks this week, this week, so hopefully it's all done. So I know the, uh, people complain that the Ustream version looks kind of poopy. We can't really show you high if we showed it in higher definition are shit with crash. It's whack. I'm pretty striking. And Idev is beautiful. Tight skin. This episode of the Joe Rogan experience podcast is brought to you by ting. If you've never heard of Tim before, I've never heard us talk about it. It's an excellent alternative to a lot of the, uh, what is okay? I don't see smoking some money. Get some weed, man. What the fuck is that? It's a spoon spoon. Brendan Walsh drunk. Brendan's hammered with his phone is in love with this phone. Is he selling? You know what Brendan Right now is texting a guy that pretending to be a girl that's going on right there.

Speaker 1:          00:06:40       That's why he's in love. Make it hilarious tweets right now. Tim has all the high end android phones. If you, um, you know, like we've talked about this before on the podcast a. unfortunately there's no other way to say it, but if you used to back in the day, if you had a smartphone other than an iphone, you were a fool. Like you really were a fool. Like if you had one of those blackberries storms. I had one of those pieces of shit. It was terrible. Davidoff Helena is, they call me out last year. He goes about a year, a quick, let's do this. I fonts. Fantastic. Oh, is it? Oh really? Hey, you heard this new thing called cars you fall. Are you still riding the horse for the longest time? If you had anything else? It was poop. But now not so much the, uh, the samsungs actually are for the first time ever.

Speaker 1:          00:07:27       They're out selling the iphones. These, these, the options of the larger screens, the Samsung Galaxy s three, like the differences size of the Brian screen with the cat on it mean the other cats though. The cool desk squad cat. I mean that is a goddamn enormous and they're really fast. I had an old, an old early version android phone and it was kind of clunky and Shitty, but this a samsung galaxy s three. It's amazing. And that there's an s four that's coming out now too. Um, and then they also have. What's even cooler is the note that note is amazing. What is that? Oh, it's fucking huge. Is this five inch phone you couldn't write on it really? They're like fucking computers. Their tablets and phones all in one. One of my first memories of view and we heard the, one of the first times we ever hung out as I came out to see you.

Speaker 1:          00:08:21       And I had no idea you were such a tech nerd fighter. Like know this guy I talked to and we were, we went looking for pit bulls were idiots. Right? So, but you were like so techie. I kind. I see these computers. You were on the Internet. I didn't know what the hell that was and then you go, hold on, I gotta go to this, we've got to fries or something and you get memory and you pop up on your computer and you put memory chips into your computer like you did it yourself. And I remember being like, this dude's I made that computer. I didn't even own a computer when you did that back then. That was like for awhile as I would make my own computers.

Speaker 3:          00:08:56       I was proud of that. Yeah. Yeah, he was, he was back in before anybody. He had huge computer screens, like you had a whole buy monitors and then hook them up as computer screen.

Speaker 2:          00:09:09       Do you remember the first time? I prefer it before I knew you could get shit on the Internet. He's, I hear in my head and I'm like, what are you doing? He was out down and I'm like, why is he keeping me out of his computer? And he stopped laughing what? And he goes and he come and you come running out and I go, what are you doing? He goes, okay, run in there and look now and I go running and he and I hear you're going here and as I go, I see this ass on the screen and I'm like, why is that a big ass on the screen? This is like weird and all of a sudden I see this Japanese guy with his hair pulled back like a Samurai and he's going, oh, oh, oh, underneath the ass. I go, oh, okay. I guess he's going to eat her ass sweater. Oh, guess what? Here comes some poor ladies and gentlemen, and the guy pulled out of the girl though, and Joe's going, he's laughing, but go ahead. It

Speaker 3:          00:09:57       was and he made them wait. So it would download was. Yeah, I had a t one installed in my house back then. Remember that God, it was such a retard. I had a t one line installed in my house. I used to ask you to go to pit bull websites. It's like dogs because I just had to throw away a lot of my computers and it was so sad because you would go through and look at all the video cards and look how cool they looked back then and they're just shit now. You know, your iphone is a million times faster than that video cards. So really incredible, isn't it? If you think about like back in the quake two days, like quake two, I used to have what was called a two video cards in sli formation mean they're both linked up. You have to separate video cards and they linked together through this computer cable and it doubles your, your bandwidth as far as the ability to offer that to you.

Speaker 3:          00:10:46       Dragged me. Could he get fucking candles? Are Guns for the quake thing? Like the special kind of animals? I was. No, no, no, no. You play quake with a mouse and keyboard. Yeah. There was something you were playing where I had to, we had to get. There's a while. Yeah. You know what? I had a controller called the something three deed and had a track ball and uh, a gun on it as well. It's really cool. I came with them. He's like, I gotta get this, but the track balls just not quite as accurate. There was some guys that were really good with that controller, but the thing was about that controller, it was very controversial because you didn't. If you learn how to use that control and then you wouldn't be good at the mouse. And the keyboard, which was widely accepted by almost everybody to be the most accurate way.

Speaker 3:          00:11:27       Some guys get really good at using the control, but there were still fucking themselves by not just going with a mouse and keyboard. Would you do what you do a live quake match in front of an audience? Every says Kevin prayer. Yeah, sure. Yeah, that'd be fun. And comic con 2000. Well, if I can, I mean it all depends on the phone if I can, but you don't have to train for it and know that's the problem. The problem is if I started training, I would get obsessed again. Yeah. But you. But you don't know the rush gets crazy rush of getting really

Speaker 4:          00:11:54       good at quake is it's so intense because you're playing in these three d games where you're running down hallways, you have a variety of weapons on you and you're chasing motherfuckers trying to kill them and when you kill them they splatter, you're shooting rockets at them and it's all in real time and the graphics are amazing and you're seeing it through a first person perspective. Either you're seeing a gun in front of you or seemed crosshairs in front of you, but you're manipulating the character and the better you get at your hand eye coordination and your understanding of maps, the more effectively you can just fuck people up. Like there's many, many, many, many levels and video game skills. And I never got really good. I got good for a regular person. Yeah. But I never got like really good. But I played some really good guys and just got slow

Speaker 2:          00:12:39       when I was doing my, uh, when I was doing a hang, not hang over a ride along that movie I shot in uh, in Atlanta with ice cube and Kevin Hart. I would go into Kevin Hart's a trailer all the time because it would just hang out in these hilarious and he'd be, he and his buddies would be taking that madden basketball game so far.

Speaker 4:          00:12:57       King seriously, like, stay like serious, like serious, like competition

Speaker 2:          00:13:03       games and get pissed off at each other if they lost. Like, and they're really a tight group. They love each other. It was war. That fucking game was war. I come in, Hey Kevin, we plan. I wouldn't even eat. They're addictive.

Speaker 4:          00:13:15       Yeah, it's super different. I, I don't fuck around with them anymore. I still play pool. I don't fuck around with video games anymore, but I am still addicted to technology, which is why like I said, we uh, we're, we're really into ting with tim. Tim provides a is not just the greatest android phones available, but we also, they also provide contract free cell phone service on a major network. It's on the sprint backbone, so it's not like you're not in a mom and pop network. You're on a, you know, a huge network and you can do that with no contracts and the way a sprint has it, not only other, no contracts, but they give you credit on unused service. So if you use less than you would on Tang sprint. Sprint, yeah. Well they're using sprint. Sprint doesn't have the. Yeah. Well don't go to sprint.

Speaker 4:          00:14:06       Take Jesus Christ who lets us get high and do commercials. I want to know. I don't know whose idea that was laughing because there's so many entering and so on. They're awesome. Yeah. I'm ting. Anyway, go to [inaudible] dot ting.com and you can save yourself 25 bucks off of either one of their phones or one of their or their service. And what I was saying was that 10 gives you credit on unused service. So if you use less than you thought you would, ting actually drops you down and, and credits you the difference on your next bill. I mean, that's unheard of. Companies never give you the money back. That's the ethical way to do it. And what they realized is you can still make money and provide people

Speaker 1:          00:14:52       a great service and you know, you don't have to fuck people over. You don't have to rip them off and you can do things in a generous way. And that's, that's how [inaudible] operates. And I love that. I think it's, it's a, it's a great ethic. And when you see a company that has, you know, that that's how they're operating their business, it makes you feel good about being connected to them. It makes you feel good about, about what, what message they're projecting about that, like the ethical, you know, I just got sponsored to buy ting, the Brian callen show, the bride cat got some good guests. I'm not to mention the 10 minute podcast, but um, uh, the, the Ting, I, when, when they came to me, I said to myself, you know, I knew there were a good company for you, so I was like, that's great.

Speaker 1:          00:15:33       But then I thought, you know, if you get a sponsored by, uh, you know, somebody wants to offer you a lot of money, say you're podcast becomes huge and somebody and some, sometimes companies can become so big and you're not sure where their interests are, what they're doing it, it really does kind of raise some questions. I don't want to be responsible for supporting or, or shelling a company that doesn't have ethical practices, you know, it's a hard one, but you don't have to anymore. There's, there's plenty of really good companies and I think, I think a lot of these companies also operating on the Internet. The Internet is pretty transparent. It's not, it's not difficult to compare rates and services and that with cars, man. People. No, no. You know, it's like. And they also know that it's an. He taught every company has enough to squeeze every last blood out of.

Speaker 1:          00:16:21       You know, when you have something that it's required, a service like cell phone service, it becomes that weird, creepy thing where they've got you. You fucking need them. Okay. You know you need that. It's right. You need the mic. Me. Mcdonald's says that they have. They never turned anybody but like a hamburger meaning. So you go in and say, I don't like my hamburger. That give you a free one. Why the hamburger? A lot of people say, well, you walk in and you're not a $2 hamburger. The average customer in Mcdonald's spends I think about $53,000 over a lifetime on Mcdonald's. They're loyal customers. So when you walked through that door, you're, you're worth $53,000. That's an interesting way of living. And so they treat you like a person, not a hamburger. They don't treat you do it because they want to be nice. How about that?

Speaker 1:          00:17:00       Oh, that Mcdonald's, you fucking county number count and assholes. That's ridiculous. How many you just do it because you don't treat someone like they're $50,000 that some companies like starbucks from what I understand, is very responsible socially. Like they, they're very intent on using the money to make our, to, to, you know, to it. It's a big responsibility and I think that you're right. I mean just how about doing it because it's the right thing to do. I just, I, you know, it just makes me happy to work with companies that I know are not douchey. I'm. So that's how I feel about tank. Go to [inaudible] dot [inaudible] dot com. Save yourself some money. I'm also, we're brought to you by squarespace. Squarespace is one of our newer sponsors. If you've never been a and don't know what it is. Squarespace is an all in one inclusive platform online for the average regular, everyday smell like you or me son to go and create their own website and it's pretty fucking bad ass. And uh, you know, when I first got my very first website, a dude named menthol created it for me. Menthol did most of my websites. No, I got to get in touch with him and he he got, he got super busy. You had a lot of things going on in his personal life into when he was a guy used to play quake with an extreme detriment. We had a quick glance and you can train you.

Speaker 3:          00:18:21       Her name was extreme.

Speaker 1:          00:18:23       A little bit better than me. When we played quick. He always just a little bit better than me. He was good. He played really good. We can have a comedy show podcast going around you while you're.

Speaker 3:          00:18:33       I am terrified of. It sounds so ridiculous, but I'm terrified of becoming addicted to playing video games going and you get excited about. I don't even know if you just get. I love when you get really excited one time. Remember you were like, you were like, we were like 30 and you're like, look at this t shirt. There was a ufc tee shirts, like a fight, this race car, this thing, this is a workout. It's a book and then he just. There was a pause and you go, I'm 12. So fucking great because we're all looking at you. Like I didn't work kind of idiots too, but Jesus wasn't overboard. Really excited over a designer on a tee shirt. Dude, I'd get really good

Speaker 1:          00:19:10       excited about the newest video games coming out. I've always been very child. Just replace your pool obsession with your quake, obsessing with the kids more. Don't want to do it. And they were like, no, I'm not. I don't go. I played pool maybe one night a week if that. Do you remember when we were. We were hunting and, and I remember I think you said or something. I was like, I don't need a lot of sleep out here because we, we're, we're so not like I really. The amount of stimulus we're exposed to, we're inundated. It's crazy. We're not designed for this, that's for sure. We're. We were designed for what you experienced when you go camping. That's what we're designed for. We're designed to take in nature. We're not designed for Times Square. The human body does not know what the fuck to do with Times Square.

Speaker 1:          00:19:52       The human body sees giant billboards and just goes, oh, your whole system is out of whack. You're like, Oh fuck, am I even looking at what about you? Well, what am I looking at when I'm going to the movies? What am I looking at when I'm, what am I dealing with? And I'm listening to songs that, the input that we received today, so we're not designed for any of this shit. Our bodies not caught up to what technology can do you fucks. That's why they. There's one theory about autism kids, kids who have hyperactive minds and, and um, central nervous systems that maybe we're evolving. We're literally evolving with technology because I totally believe that. I totally believe that it makes sense. I mean, I think it's terrifying for people because we love our emotions, but I think the reality is we're probably going to eventually outgrow them.

Speaker 3:          00:20:40       Oh Shit. Did I say that I was having fun alive. I've

I don't know who to give me some chimp Kettlebell. No, I'm buying them. I'm like, everybody else. I'm getting one to Donald Cowboy cerrone to. I wanted my man right there.

Speaker 3:          00:25:21       Look, it needs to be given away to some people that she was just too cool not to have. It looks like a chimp biting off your Dick. That is the chimp biting off your Dick face and do for motivation for motivation and your workouts. You know, you could hold the kettle bells like that, looking at the chimp and then drop it down to your Dick and then push away. Drop the guys your Dick and they push, motivate. It can be the new kettle bell routine like the, uh, the chimp bite your Dick kip ups or something there. I just read a book called our inner ape and he talks about how we're a bipolar, a bunny comparisons to chimps and gorillas, but one of the things that they use today at a circus of thing where they had a chimp that they muscled and they took strong men and tried to control that chimp trying to wrestle with it. None of them. None of that.

Speaker 3:          00:26:11       It's got four hands look forehands yeah, and the amount of strength five times the point. We don't even understand it. It's just we think, well, they're about our size, so you know, like, you know, you're dealing with something completely different. It's just completely different. But if you want to get chimps drawn, go get yourself some other shit that we have. We have regular kettlebell still like the God that was April fool's fucking foul and Joey Diaz fucking Kettlebell. That's so ridiculous. I love it. I want it. We have a club bells. We started selling those now and Chin up bars and all kinds of different fitness shit. And uh, of course, a lot of great fitness supplements including hemp force, the delicious and nutritious hemp protein supplement and as raw maca and raw or raw cocoa and MCA. And um, it's sweetened with Stevia. Says very little sugar.

Speaker 3:          00:27:03       There's only one gram of sugar in a full serving. It's fucking delicious. Super good for you. And we have to get it from Canada because our county twat bad government says it's illegal to grow the non psychoactive version of his marijuana. You can't grow it. So these silly bitches, so we have to buy it from Canada. But, uh, it's super good for you. It really easy to digest. I love it. In the morning, if I don't have the time to put together a Kale shake, I'm just fucking running out the door. I take one of those seats. Oil, coconut waters. I throw in some hemp force. Boom. It's not like a lot of food, but it gives, it fills me up. It's nutritious. It's easy to digest, it's super easy to digest. You getting some nutrition, like couldn't attrition in a, in a small forum. And it's great after workouts too. Anyway. [inaudible] DOT com. Oh. And, and it, um, if you use the code name Brogan, you will save 10 percent off any and all supplements. All right, we got through it. Brian. Counselor, we're going to. We're already getting busy. So it's a place that music first right now. Oh yeah.

Speaker 6:          00:28:33       My voice is. His name is breakable beats and you can find them on sound, sound speeds. And it really starts off putting because it talks about. And then it goes right into the, here's the, here's the breakdown being terrible.

Speaker 3:          00:29:31       That's hilarious. That's hilarious. That is one of the most surprising things about podcasting is the amount of cool shit that people do on their own. You know, people

Speaker 1:          00:29:42       create funny. A youtube compilations

Speaker 2:          00:29:45       did I have these guys in San Antonio and I can't remember the name there. I'm going to try to find them to give a shout out, but they tweaked them to be in San Antonio and these guys create a whole video devoted to Brian Callan and, and no console out. No consequences, no guns allowed. And I was dying. They made like a three minute, like really well done. Put together videos. So commercial for you? Yeah. They made a commercial for me and on twitter and it's trying to find them because they were so awesome. And uh, and anyway, I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll just give a shout out when we, but I mean that's what the internet does. You get a bunch of guys who are like, dude, let's make a video for them advertising. I was, I was dying. You guys are coming to my show for free by the way. Just come up to me and telling me that you did it. Not everybody will be like,

Speaker 1:          00:30:31       yeah, you got to say, are you getting any proof man? Need to do another one? Right. I know the guys, but I know what they look like. It's a great thing, man. It's great. Democratizing force and I have a beautiful voice. I didn't realize that. So I think they put some of that fucking crazy shit and electronic music thing. What's it called? Yeah, Auditorium. They all turned the fuck out of. You know, they didn't decide. I say Jay Z, who uses that auto tune shit t pain. I think I sound like Josh Groban. I don't even know what that guy sounds like. I when I read it, yes you do. I'm trying to find. I would not be able to pick it out of a lineup and you know, if you played it for me, it wasn't him. You would get me. You can sell me a fucking album with johnny to tone from down the block saying, if you could be one rock'n'roll front man of all time, what would it be? Oh Jesus. It's tough to fuck with David Lee Roth. It's tough to fuck with diamond. Dave about it, like when it comes to front man, dude, there was some years in the 19 eighties, like 84 85 through the jump era, they dominated, dominated, dominated, which was incredible. I mean, it's no wonder they broke up. They, they, they were hitting it so hard. Of course they all lost their mind. I spent time at Diamond Dave. Oh yeah. And

Speaker 2:          00:32:05       He, uh, he had some real, had real conversations like three, like two hours long. And he, because he used to rent up David Offs, the apartment above David, he had a building dove had and he used to rent from Doug Davidoff above him and he basically would practice karate. He had his helicopters license. He was an emt, a real dramatic and saved lives. He'd be, he had to pull somebody out of a car and they'd be like, you're David diddly wrong buck. And he was like, ah, but he told us these great stories and um, he, he like, he's very, very spartan, like he has a bowl and a and

Speaker 1:          00:32:40       sometimes he'd sleep on the roof outside in a tent. He's just a real like, you know, that's very unusual day. He's not in debt money or anything. It's got living in a really small apartment in Tokyo now. There it is. He came on the podcast and talk to us about. He's been living in Tokyo for 10 months. Really? Yeah. This is what a trip this guy is. He was. They were going to do some shows in Tokyo and I go, how many flight for how long? He's like, we're going to do about two weeks in Tokyo. I'm like, okay. He went for 10 months. For 10 months. He said that Eddie got sick and so when they had to postpone, it took a long time for them to be able to reschedule because it's a big tour. Sure. So when Eddie got second and they rescheduled, he said, well, Hey, I'll just go over there and see what it's like.

Speaker 1:          00:33:23       So he fucking moves to Tokyo. He used to Kayak around Manhattan. Yeah. What are you gonna do today? I'm going to Kayak around Manhattan. The crack around Manhattan, the island of Manhattan Kayak in the river. He's. He does what he wants when he's taken sword classes. Oh yeah. That's what he's doing is taking sword fighting classes and learning Japanese. So he came over here. He's speaking Japanese and telling them, telling us about his fucking sword fight. He's 58. Well he refers to karate is cut out to my favorite when I studied get out to for many years. In fact I studied so long. I feel as though I am good at. Well he has a legit martial arts background. There's no doubt about that. Like he, he definitely liked. I remember he would throw kicks, like when he would do shows, I'm like, that guy can move his fucking box.

Speaker 1:          00:34:12       Can do the splits. Yeah. He would throw these crazy high kicks in and you're like, Holy Shit. Like you can't. Like the way he was throwing kicks was like a guy who's trained martial arts and seriously, yeah. Yeah. A lot in and trained very hard in really good shape. He's in great shape, man. It's just, it's interesting to meet a guy like that. It's like this 58 year old sorta. God just still does whatever the fuck you want to go to Japan, you know, fuck it. I think. Yeah, I think what happens though, when you, when you've hit the apex of fame, like when you're a rock star on his level, you're the biggest that you don't get more famous than that. You just don't on earth on earth, on earth man. And uh, and, and just to play the stadiums and just they go crazy.

Speaker 1:          00:34:53       And I think once you do that and you're, you kind of, if you're an interested person in the world, you realize that it's like you get immune to that. You actually, I think you'd get immune to it. I think you'd get immune to that public and brace and then you've got to find some way else to keep yourself inspired and excited and interested in, you know, um, that sounds like what he, what he does, man. That's why he's got such varied interests, man. He's such a, such an interesting dude. I've got him on my phone right now. I've got their greatest hits. I was just listening to them like diver down to some of those songs running with the devil. Oh God. Damn. Those were good songs. Unbelievable. It just. But they were so big that it's no wonder that they broke up. It's like, who the fuck knows how to manage that?

Speaker 1:          00:35:41       Like I was having a conversation with someone about Justin bieber where they're like, you know, do what he did. He did this the other day and that happened the other day. I'm like, do you know how fucking crazy I would be if I was Justin Bieber? That kid's holding it together. Rum Markup Markup. They. Yeah. When I was 18 and 19 years old, if I had $100,000,000 on a fucking Ferrari, I right now, Bro, right now talking to her right now, I'd be a mess. Yeah. I mean the kid's fine. He's fine. So he spit on somebody who knows what happened, really knows when you're constantly surrounded by people. Oh, he's a nice guy. He was in the laugh factory. He was in that pain. The crowd on a Tuesday night and and Donna Eric gets onstage and Justin's up there and he goes, just, and it must have been really hard for you, but you know, before you made it, that one tough year when you were like 14.

Speaker 1:          00:36:34       Fucking great. There is also comes up with one liners like just off the top of his head. He's an animal. He's, he's so fucking legit fucking dumb. Stand up for 100 years and a high level. I always love to remind dom that I paid to see him before I ever did comedy myself. Saturday. Yeah, I remember his jokes. I did his job. Got I paid to see him in Nick's comedy. Stop. I actually went two nights in a row because he missed his flight or something like that on the first night. And so that was how I found out about Denis leary had. Dennis leary went up that night and I was like, who is this guy? Where the fuck is dominant? I painted seat down my rarer. Well, something happened. There was like a missed flight or something along those lines. So I was like, God, this guy who's this guy was like so bummed out, but he fucking destroyed.

Speaker 1:          00:37:26       He destroyed no care, care for cancer. I mean this is before I knew anything about the plagiarism or anything about the bad things you hear about leary. All I knew then I didn't even know who he was, but he went on and fucking amazing. He was like my favorite comedian for like six months. Incredible. When you see somebody who's that good at something you don't stand up for the first time and you have like maybe designs on what? Like I just did this interview just now today for the San Antonio thing and I literally said to the guy, I said, I still can't believe I can do standup. I can't believe I'm lucky enough. I truly lucky enough to go around the country and make people laugh. I can't believe I have that capacity. Like the great surprise of my life was waking up one day and realizing I think maybe I can do this if I really practice. You know what I mean? It's like, when did you, when did you come to that? I will always thought you always knew you could do. No Man. No, I was a silly goose always as you know. But um, I remember I a Patty Jenkins, my old, my old girlfriend, the director said, Brian, I got, I made a speech or something at a wedding or something and I was funny and she said, I got three words for you dude. Stand up comedy. You're not

Speaker 3:          00:38:36       going to walk into a room as this guy or that like, whoa, that guy's really unique. He's five foot 11, 165 pounds with Brown eyes and Brown hair, you know, you're, you're not going to go in there looking like you said, but you're funny. And she got me to start doing it. And I was like, I can't do this. But I went home and wrote a monologue on what it's like to be reborn. A penguin, a legless flightless bird in the middle of the South Pole. And I was like, that's kind of a funny idea. Concept. I don't know. And I wrote it and I, I came up to my friends at night and I said, hey, I heard this comic doing these jokes and I pretended it was somebody else. And they laughed. And that's slowly how I built a set. That's a good way of doing it.

Speaker 3:          00:39:13       And that's so like your personality to do that. You're not really a self congratulatory God. Terrible. That's, that's what you would do. You would, you would congratulate someone else. Make a pre pretend character. Oh, my friend is so funny. He says, that's so funny. I do have so hard. And I was like, I think I'm onto something very clever way to begin standing up, kind of like to practice on people. I would do that with some of the, this common cat guy with that. I don't know what he looks like. He had red hair and I do the joke. This was all before I met you. Yes. Yeah. When I met you, you were doing comedy a little bit. You were, but you had gotten into the door. And it's, and I don't blame anybody for this, but there's, there's a, uh, an attitude that exists or at least it used to when you got a series or got some sort of a sitcom stopped when you could stop doing your stand up.

Speaker 3:          00:40:01       You know, I actually had a good friend and a guy I respect very much said to me, you know, who's a producer? And I was like, are you talking about like, what are you, this is, I'm just doing this for money like crazy. Stand up is the greatest thing in the world for you to, you don't know because you've never done it. And you know, and even if you do it and you suck at it, if there's a possibility that you can get good enough to be good at it, stick with that shit so much fun. It's way better than the activity. Also a constant challenge. Like if you're a Rockstar, you can sing the same song for 30 years. The stones can still sing. Start me up. And everybody cheers. You fucking stand up. You've got to reinvent yourself. When they come to see you, they, they, they want to see a new bag of tricks, bro.

Speaker 3:          00:40:40       Oh yeah. They're not there to like see your do your greatest hits. Yeah. I put on my special whenever it was a couple months ago. I don't remember. I'm not doing a single bit from that. That's it. It's all done. That shit's dead and burdens what I'm. All my stuff is no fun to do though, man. Because uh, I, I, you know, I've been inspired by quite a few guys that do that on a regular basis. Bill Burr does on a regular basis. Louis CK does on a regular basis and I think he got a lot of people thinking that way. Like just throw me thinking and come up with the Nh totally right. Because what you really want to see is a lot of different material from comedians. It's also keeps you in a really active stays in line. Like I've really learned how to write anywhere no matter what. And I'm always thinking of new stuff. So we decided like how hard we can push ourselves. Like, Oh God, I knew our a year. I couldn't do it. Yeah, you probably could. You probably could just fucking go to work and then when you do do it, like when are coming up with new

Speaker 1:          00:41:34       stuff. It's so. It's so exciting. It's like the shows have a different energy to them because you're still laughing at the shit too. It's like it's still hitting you like, and I don't know how you are when you're creating material, but when I'm creating a material, I don't even know where the fuck it's coming from. I never feel like it's mine. I never do it. It's a beautiful notion that you're a channel for something that already exists, you know? Well, I think it's because the only way to truly use your creativity correctly is to take your sense of you out of the equation. So it's not really that you're tapping into a muse per se, as to take you out of the equation, allows all the creativity to sort of appear and unfold. It's you. This idea of you. Ego is such an overwhelmingly constricting mindset.

Speaker 1:          00:42:21       You know, and then let me, let me, let me piggyback on that before you go on to this. I love this. I love what you're saying. And, and, and when you say ego, a lot of that for you young people. Let me get specific and I think a lot of is we all define ourselves on very strong lines. Men especially in this society are told to define yourself along strong lines. You know, I'm, I'm a fighter, I'm a tough guy. You can't push me whatever it might be. I'm a musician that comes with a lot of baggage and I think that that one of the nice things about trying to learning how to create is to loosen those lines a little. Don't try to define yourself, don't have. You don't have to be right. Don't, don't pigeon hole yourself into a tough guy or I'm this guy, right?

Speaker 1:          00:42:59       No, not when you're creating. And it goes back to what you said, take yourself out of the equation. Well, people try to define themselves because they're insecure. You know what I mean? That's how when I was a young man and I was insecure, this one I tried to, I tried to define myself. I would try to pretend to be somebody I would try to, you know, as much as I wanted to be an individual, complete individual. I certainly wasn't good at it, but, you know, at the end it's also like I was just, I just played volleyball with Brendan Schaub, mayhem, Miller and uh, my buddy Kiran all fighters and, you know, obviously, and I'm sitting there looking at the fucking, like, just, you know, Jason's been fighting for 15 years, retired now, but he's still a fucking rough athletic, big guide. I'm looking at fucking shop.

Speaker 1:          00:43:41       Should have a statue. I should have a statue built to him that I can just, you know. And, and, um, you're looking at what the fuck are you talking? I'm gay. I'm gay. I'm straight. I just want to talk about Brendan. I get very good. No, but I'm looking at how big and strong these guys. And I thought to myself, there's always somebody stronger. There's always somebody stronger than those guys. And, and by the way, no, that's not true. There's going to be one strongest guy. It's gotta be it's gotta be this and that. It's not a, there's always gonna be someone brings me to my point, which is the idea that, you know, there, there's not a real difference in some ways between me and sharp or somebody who's really big in the sense that yes, they're stronger, but we're all compared to somebody else.

Speaker 1:          00:44:18       We're all kind of like, depending on what context you're standing in, I'm stronger than this guy over here. He's stronger than me. You really think about this shit. Yeah. Why? Well, I was just thinking about how we, we, we kind of, we, I was thinking about how we try to kind of aim for certain things, but you're 45, seven as an example. I'm just using an example of anything you do. Like if you're a musician you want to play like that guy. I'm just saying that it, the, the only thing that matters is that as a false, that is a false way of going about things. All you can do is control your own expression and who you are. That's all you can do is go. There is no the idea of a comparing to something bigger or something that is an illusion almost. It's the only thing you can do is get it.

Speaker 1:          00:45:02       Try to not dilute who you are. You want to keep it as. Because it's so hard to say. Saying that and doing that. It's like, what is he saying? So what does he mean? You know? It's just, you got to know that your ego will fuck you up your ego even though you feel like it's part of you and you feel like it's good to have it protect you, so you're bullshit yourself about things. It's super important to know when you fuck up and not be in denial because when you're in denial, it sets you back because no one's perfect. I'm not perfect. You're not perfect. There's not a single perfect human being. The idea is ridiculous because it's like you don't. You're a different person depending on when I catch you, you're a different person depending on what time of the day and you know and what, what, what happened to you recently or you know, what bad thing has gone down in your life.

Speaker 1:          00:45:50       You're a different person in every minute of every day, 300, 65 days in a way like, you know, trying to, trying to say, this is who I am. I'm a tough guy or on this. You've got to just learn from mistakes. Always of course have the ethic of, you know, just trying to be a good person who's trying to be nice. Try not to. Yeah, but. Well let me ask you this. Like you were saying, and I was thinking about this the other day, you know, nobody's perfect. You can try to strive for perfection. It's kind of a good thing. You don't ever reach it, but the idea is you can imagine what perfection isn't a way. Like you ever feel that way. You ever feel like, you know, like you're doing this thing which is stand up and you keep putting out stuff in your mind's eye.

Speaker 1:          00:46:29       You have a notion of what, what the perfect. I don't. I think that's all waste. This is what I do. What I want or what I would try to do. I just try to keep writing funny shit. Just bright it, make it funny, put it together as well as I know, you know, I explained this to Ra once, but it's applicable to me to, you know, Ari and I were talking about comedy and like what's going on now that he has like real fans and this, this, this new obligation. And I said, you know, if I go, I'm an Ra, shift your fan. I go, I think you're really hilarious. So if I was, you know, take me out of the context of being a professional stand up comedian. If I, if I was a guy just to doing something else, you're laughing and I found out about Ari, I'd be like, Oh, this guy is funny. I would want to buy his CD. I would want to buy his DVD. I would become an arch for your fan. I go, but once that happens, you're the only guy who can give me Ari. Fear you're the only guy who can produce that material, like you have this weird

Speaker 4:          00:47:30       obligation and if you do something like this, comics that were like really big at one point in time and they sort of stopped delivering comedy, they stopped making, making new specials and people sort of gave up on them because they don't really talk about them that much anymore because they're not getting material from them on a regular basis. You know? So you're the only Brian callen you're the only guy you're trying to reach Brian Cowen fans. So I just try to. I know that people think that the ridiculous shit that I do is funding and I know how to do the ridiculous should I do so just keep doing it. That's my thing. Yeah. The idea that the. I guess the idea of perfection is really a static notion and you're never static as a verb. I always, yeah, always trying to update the bits. It's a little bit different.

Speaker 4:          00:48:18       Every show there's always something new I'm adding, I'm taking away. I approaching it a different way. I'm, I'm fucking with it. I'm trying to find out how to do it the right way and I'll learn along the way through trial and error and from my own feelings of being too verbose or too clunky or whatever the fuck it is. And so in that way, and doing it like that, like you're never in the equation equation the equation. The equation is always the impact of the material, how, how, what is the best way I can do to make this funny, like, what is if I was, you know, if I'm experiencing this myself, like, what is the best way to do it? So you sort of become a passenger, you know, it's like you're the one who has to sort of orchestrate it. But, you know, the concept of the Muse, I hate when I say, you know, that many times the concept of the muse that's, that's a, uh, fakers um, you know, I really should be like, oh, I'm, I'm, I'm like, no, no, you don't know anything.

Speaker 4:          00:49:10       You didn't know what the fuck are you even talking about right now. But I, I feel like it's, um, the more you can take yourself out of it, the more you can say, I just want to be the best I can be. I want to be perfect. I want to be all that shit is like, that guy's not doing any comedy. That's that one. Who needs all that? That's an annoying, that ego thing. That's the creepy part of you that you don't want to feed. You want that to shrivel up. You want that to shrivel up like a witch's tit. Because I remember that there was a lawrence, Olivia was a famous actor and he'd done this production of, uh, you know, of Othello or something like that. And he was amazing and everybody came back and said was the most incredible performance and he wasn't really black, dark mood.

Speaker 4:          00:49:51       And I said, well, what's the matter? He goes, he said, the greatest performance we've anybody's ever seen. And he said, I know, I just have no idea how to repeat it, you know? And, and his thinking was wrong. I sense there, you know, you just got to go to. Then you got to go zen, you gotta go Zan and understand that if you can do that, that means you could do that. It doesn't mean you're going to do it every night. I mean, there's going to be nice, like there's times when I'm talking on this podcast where every third or fourth fucking word is my fat. Stupid tongue is hitting my teeth wrong. Excuse me. I mean marijuana and it's not even that. It's not. It's not that I'm London Pretty Dapper, just not. What am I trying to say is like there's. There's ebbs and flows to things.

Speaker 4:          00:50:31       There's never a perfect absolute sustainable rhythm for anything. So you, if you, if Lawrence Olivier can crush it like that, what that means is that he can crush it. Like that doesn't mean you're gonna crush it like that every night, but he crushed it like that lie and it's alive when things are live, it's a different experience. Do you remember in the book of five rings with me on the fast, she says, practice something enough so that the thing of itself reveals itself. The spirit reveals that. What do you think he meant by that? Well, because the same thing he meant that you, if you know the way broadly, you can see it in all things and that's the same thing. It's like the way is the spirit of a thing is really excellence. Whether it's bowling or golf or archery or the spirit of a thing is excellence.

Speaker 4:          00:51:20       The spirit of a thing is finding how to control the body and to get it all online or how would you run up and do that? Perfect. Three point. Oh, or three point foul shot. Did you ever see that film, that video of that autistic kid that never played basketball before and they threw him in on the last game to Brian, find this on my twitter. This is incredible shit. Matt. Incredible, incredible shit. This kid, it's kind of unrelated, but this kid has a high functioning autistic and they put him in on this a basketball game and he's like, you could tell that the kids like loved by all these teammates and when they take this kid and they finally let him play in the game. So they're one of the last games. The kid gets up, the place goes nuts. They love him, they're cheering for him. He throws his first ball and it's a Mrs. by like six feet and they're like, oh Jesus Christ. And then he can't miss. He's nailing three pointers from the outside and the crowd is going fucking crazy. This kid misses one shot and then gets in this insane groove of over and over and over again, slamming three pointers. He won like the school record. See Mrs. That's, that's not it. There's A. Yeah, that's one of them. Yeah.

Speaker 7:          00:52:45       But Jay Mac wasn't done. He kept shooting and kept hitting another person.

Speaker 4:          00:52:50       Oh, did you start this like inside of it? A little bit. Okay. Yeah. The beginning. They show the first basket with which he misses by like six feet and then they went crazy. Look at them, run on the field, grab them and picking them up and carrying them around their shoulders. Imagine how good that kid must've felt. Man. Athletic director. If I retired today, this would be the one thing that I talked about forever. Wow. Dude, are you kidding me? Going amazing. Yes. That's another word for excellence. I think as you, as you speak about it as harmony, everything moving in the way it's supposed to, that that's what it sounds like you were talking about that, that that's a form that's kind of like hard

Speaker 2:          00:53:26       harmonizing with a frequency man, like getting into something and a and a pattern and where everything is. Everything is firing the way it should.

Speaker 4:          00:53:33       Yeah, and and understanding what it, what it really is like the more like in Musashi talking about it's totally applicable to standup comedy because in talking about like the more time you practice it in, the more you observe it in, the more you understand it, the more it's what it is reveals itself to you and then you know how to operate and try to achieve excellence within it. That's ever it is. You're almost writing it. You're almost, it's, it's doing the work. Yeah. That's why I think that activities are really important for people. There's a lot of people that unfortunately don't engage in activity. They don't engage and don't have hobbies or anything like that. I learn a language or do something. Do something that's exciting art of learning.

Speaker 2:          00:54:15       You know the problem with our education system, Gore Vidal was saying this, is that what it was, that we don't have an education system that teaches you how to think. We don't play so true. And that's, that's, that's the, there is an art to learning, man. There's an art to learning. There's an art

Speaker 4:          00:54:30       art to be in a human beings, right? It really is. And no one teaches us. We don't know what the fuck we're doing. We're all idiots raising other people, bar with the same flaws that we were raised with. There's no manual for it. Exactly. And there's, when you look at what we consider our, our, our source of education as far as like what is distributed to us nightly, what's the news? Right? I mean that's really the education that people have today. Once you get out of school, unless you're reading books on your own, where are you getting your information about the world? You're getting it from the fucking news. The news doesn't really represent what's a going on in the world, and B, it doesn't say anything about how you should be dealing with this, how you should be thinking, how we, how we should resolve these issues. It's like this tattle tale that just goes running over and tells us about all the fucked up shit that's happening in the world, but they don't. It's not a dialogue with a person. It's like a source of information

Speaker 2:          00:55:24       shy. The way that that complaint goes back at least 3,500 years. Socrates, when he was in his trial said, you take a, you wouldn't take a horse to try to ride it and not train it. The same applies to a human being. You got to, you got to start with, with the notion of he was trying to teach philosophy in the sense that you better, you better know what questions to ask throughout your life. And we should start with young people, educate young people the right way with the right questions. If you don't do that, then, then you know, you've got to start with a base almost, you know. And, and, uh, we don't, we don't do that. Men were, it's almost like learning Jujitsu, just learning moves without learning the principles behind it

Speaker 4:          00:56:04       first. Yeah. Well it's also like learning Jujitsu without going over the real correct drills, learning real life applications and, and the, you know, the way school is set up, I, you know, again, you motherfucker, the way school is set up, it's, they have x amount of thousand kids and they have to get these kids through with a basic understanding of the building blocks of our world. They have to understand that they have done understanding how to structure a sentence and they understand they have to understand form paragraphs and they had got to know what happened in the past and then you're off on your own. Good luck fucker. Stopped College.

Speaker 2:          00:56:41       Yeah. You talk about taking yourself out of the equation. That's an Asian thing more than a western thing. Certainly more than American. You know, if they had Chinese people look at a fish tank and then they had Americans look at the fish tank, the Americans, uh, describe the fish. The Chinese described how the relationship between the rocks, the seaweed, the fish, the boat in there and everything they were, they were looking at the entire, the entire picture and that, that's a lot of it is. Um, but it was a paramedic in a medic, I'm sorry, in Vietnam for two terms, two tours. And one of the things he found was that the Viet Cong, when they get injured, they wouldn't go into shock. And you could, you can interrogate them. They wouldn't go into shock. The Americans get it in. A lot of times they go into shock. It's very dangerous when you go into shock, which is actually, you know what shock is

Speaker 4:          00:57:26       the lock. Yeah. But you're trying to flush

Speaker 2:          00:57:29       blood from your extremities and go right to where the wound is. Like sort of like the core area and your body can shut down. It's very dangerous. And that is from panic. That's right. That's from your, your, your heart races. And instead of slowing down. And so why? Well, one of the things was that when an American would get shot, you'd go, Holy Shit, I've been shot. And you focus on that wound. When Viet Cong would get shot, they were taught. Now the whole culture wasn't about you. You were a leaf on a very big tree. Put your attention out there. And, and that was kind of one of the things he took back from Vietnam because somebody said to him, you know, you've been teaching this acting class from seven to 12 for five years. I've never seen you yawn once, not once. And he says, I don't think about, I don't, I don't think about myself. I'm never part of this equation, man. I learned a long time ago. Even if I'm tired, it's just a form of energy. And I spent a lot of time. If I start worrying about being tired, I'll get tired. He's got he, he was 55 and he just was very good at taking themselves completely out of the.

Speaker 4:          00:58:23       Yeah. I think that the, you can definitely trip yourself up, but some bad behavior patterns as far as your, your feeling in your health and the negativity that you see in the environment all over the place. I mean, we've all been around that one person that just complains about everything. Like, oh great, look at the hotel we're staying at. Oh fuck. Look at this fucking place. Oh Jesus, great. This place hasn't been updated since the 70 [inaudible] like, will you shut the fuck up man?

Speaker 2:          00:58:48       There's a guy who, who um, I don't want to speak out of turn. I don't know if his name, but he's a writer, tried to kill himself and he was listening to birds and some girl was there and she was talking to him and she said, listen to the birds. He goes, what are you here? He said, I don't, I don't like listening to bird. She said, why? She goes, because they're so beautifully says you hear. But I hear a bunch of animals trying to fight for territory and scratch out and yelling at each other. And she went, hey dude, don't ruin birds for me man. Maybe smart as fuck you. I don't want to be. You're kind of smart, you know? And it really is a question of what you choose to look at, what you choose to hear.

Speaker 4:          00:59:20       Well, how emotionally invested

Speaker 2:          00:59:22       you choose to be in whether these birds fight to the death. I'll see your belief system, right? Yeah. You know what I mean? You, you, you can change your belief system in some ways. Choosing whether or not you're going to be affected by all this information. You know, what I was going to say is that the, when we were talking about the, uh, needing some sort of a, a lesson in how to think and how to operate the mind. If the human mind, if the human body was the just, you know, just the human experience. If that wasn't an instrument that you had to learn to use, think about navigating the human life with the human body and language and think about if you came from somewhere else and the human body wasn't in the human experience, wasn't just a person living a life but rather was a ride that you had to figure out how to, how to master, how to accomplish and that the human animal with its creative abilities with disabilities or reach out to people with its, uh, ability to build buildings and use electricity.

Speaker 2:          01:00:24       And all these different things, that's a. that's a, that's a vehicle. That's what that is. Learn it, learn how to use that vehicle. You would have intensive study for a lot of just trying to figure out how to go about the correct way of doing this. They would be like, you know, you. You'd have to figure out what is the best way to think is the best way. Well, most beneficial way to you to approach every project as a, as a person moving around in this human world with this human machine, it would be like a super complicated thing, but instead it's just two people. Fucking some guy shoots a load in the girl, she swells up blank. A person comes out, no one knows shit. Sound effects by the way. Thank you. So the three of them are standing there. No one knows what the fuck is going on.

Speaker 2:          01:01:10       And they keep doing the same thing. They keep interacting with each other. Same thing, the way the human, the way the human being and the human body interacts with the world is so bizarre and complicated and to get it right and correct. Take so much fucking thinking. It's a mandate saying Hudl. It, we just let these things just go loose out into the world, you know what I mean? Which is why people are desperate and lonely and all that. We're caught in this machine. There's a real machine going on with society today and that machine is, uh, the building of society, the increasing of bandwidth, you know, the interconnectivity that's provided by technology. It's all of that and it's all of that with this exponentially increasing momentum behind it. And we're all caught up in that and we're caught up in that and we have mortgages and we have bills and we have all these, but we're, we're, we're doing is, we're feeding this system.

Speaker 2:          01:02:12       We're feeding the system of televisions and computers and cell phones and new clothes and distracting. It's so distracting. Like you, you, you start unknowledgeable and, and the Greeks who I said you go from knowledge but you don't jump all the way to wisdom. There's an in between place, which is correct. Opinion correct. Opinion comes from when you study, as you're reaching for wisdom, you start to develop. The world crystallizes around you with the right teaching and and stuff. You start to learn what the what, what sort of the correct way to look at and reach and follow the correct opinion is, and then you finally get to a point where you understand and can explain why that is the correct opinion. That takes a long fucking time. That's life mastery in a way, but it's like what you're saying is it's, it's, it's we don't have a system and we tried it with public education, but we don't have a way or a system to really teach people how to live the art.

Speaker 4:          01:03:09       No, no one knows what the fuck they're doing and we the, the people that were raised by, they didn't know what the fuck they're doing either. I mean, my parents are very nice people. My mother is a with my step dad. They've been together forever. It's like they're very nice couple. They're very nice people, but they were raised by people, didn't know shit, and their parents were raised by people who didn't know shit and this era that we're living in right now, it's like human beings are just starting to wake up and realize that we were all living in this weird sort of momentous world. His world that moves on momentum and momentum doesn't make any sense at all and we're all just waking up realizing that it was set up by people didn't know what the fuck they were doing. I mean they knew how to build buildings and knew how to use electricity, but no one knew how to teach society how to chill the fuck out, relax and enjoy each other. Not One fucking person besides like Martin Luther King and a few people with some dreamy speeches. Not One person emphasizes that in the role of government. Not One person is pushing that like can't we figure out a way that human beings are just nicer to each other? Can't we figure out a way where there's maybe a little bit less profit, but also less pollution and less fucking with people and less light, less control over the human population?

Speaker 2:          01:04:32       I would say that you're also dealing with the residue of of a most of human history. Almost all of it has been not enough to eat. Yeah, and dying.

Speaker 4:          01:04:41       Yeah. No, it's no doubt. There's been a lot of things that led us to this point. This is also the first point. We have a responsibility as the human beings that have the first access to this sort of information to not be looked at like a bunch of silly Fox by the people of the future because that's a real problem because if I look back, I've been living this life right now. Just looking at all that silly nonsense that human beings are involved with. Like everybody. I looked on twitter and everybody has these fucking equal signs on their twitter Avatar to let every one know that they're into marriage equality, equality. It's marriage equality. You

Speaker 3:          01:05:17       should be. You should be. That's like saying you're having that on your twitter Avatar. You might as well just say water's wet is hot, hot. It's cold, cold. I didn't. Of course marriage equality makes sense. The fact that you even have to to. Who are you talking to who does this? But seriously in 2000 and fucking 13, anybody we should find out who doesn't have that on their avatar. It should be that. Let's. How about nobody use her face anymore and, and, and let's, let's find out and do the people who have a problem with it. It gives a shit whether or not a couple of lesbians want to marry each other. You're an asshole. You're an asshole. And maybe nobody tells you you're an asshole. Why do you give a fuck about them? You worrying at all about what other people are doing? Sucks.

Speaker 3:          01:06:04       It sucks for everyone around you. You fuck everything up. You care that two people love each other and they want to sign some paperwork. Why do you give a fuck? What do you give a fuck of? She signed some paperwork that the other chicks going to be your ass eating slave till the end of time and she'll have to be reincarnated in the future ass eater and upon turning 18 will resume her practice. Whereas is this going to be immortal right then on paper with what fucking difference does it make? Why do you care if you care? You're an asshole. You're just an ass or understood it. I never understood that. It's fucking dumb. The desire to control the people and when pose your mythology or your belief system on someone else, it's really uncreative fucks to are not thinking about how ridiculous you're going to look in the future when they're looking back on the past, the way they looked at those idiots that thought that leaches were the best way to cure your broken leg.

Speaker 3:          01:06:55       Those fucking people. We laugh at them today and don't tell me about scientific applications of leeches. Yeah, fucks because there's none of that is people like, you know, there are medical applications for leeches. Like people sent me that because I was making fun for gangrene. Hey, you can use it for stuff, but guess what? Medicine works better for almost every maggots. For Nuggets. Yeah. Maggots. Sorry. I think digitally just for something to like to coagulate blood or some shit with maggots will eat all the [inaudible] tissue. Right? What they, uh, they'll clean up dead and they think stop infections. It's really kind of crazy for you. The maggots eating your flesh is good. Put a cast on you. They throw a bunch of maggots down there and because they can't eat you, they can only eat the stuff that's fucked up. I mean they're not really like good eaters, so like it pays to have them all mushed up and your moons and actually apparently they're good eating if you need to either a high source of protein. That shit. What's insearch? It isn't as interesting how we have this, like really these really clear views about what is and isn't good food or something that you should eat. And crabs and crabs and spiders. Could there be an animal that's closer to looking like each other in the same family? Yeah. They're in the same family. Found out that lobsters were in the lice family. I couldn't eat lobsters anymore. I was like, what do you mean in the lice family

Speaker 4:          01:08:17       dudes in the jungle that they cook up the trenches. No, he never seen them. They look yummy. It looks like a soft shell crab. I bet. I bet. I bet. I bet they taste good. They're all in the same family, but we have this weird thing, right? Like when we're talking about maggots, like if it wasn't like, look, what is hemp force protein? It's fucking ground up plants. Mushy ground up plans. Like, okay, you eat plants. Got It. Okay. What is. What are maggots? Maggots are just these little fleshy. Okay, well what? What? What do you eat? What? Tell me what you do. What are you cool with? You? Cool with yogurt. Eat the flesh off an animal and cool with yogurt. You know what that is? You know you're eating like a fucking civilization. You know you're eating the living organism or eating acidophilus.

Speaker 4:          01:08:59       A pure living organisms. Bacteria. What are you doing? Stupid. Do you know what you're doing? But you're like, new maggots are bad. Mcateer little buddies that your little wound cleaning buddies, they're full of protein and you're saying no to them, but yet you're just chugging down that fucking corn fed beef. These fatty, diseased cows, fat, sloppy heart pounding as they pumps blood through fucking caked up arteries, slivers living in no shit. Oh my God. Just to fucking amount of fat that you get on. But that's the only way you get a delicious Ribeye. The kind that you really. Oh, you cook it over a little salt and pepper. Don't get crazy. All you need is a little salt and pepper. The, uh, grass fed beef though. Once you get used to that. It's a. to me it's, I feel so much better eating. Maybe it's psychological, the oils, the oils, first of all, the room.

Speaker 4:          01:09:53       And it's. So cows are supposed to eat grass. It would. They're definitely, you're eating a healthier and for sure it tastes more like a game. And also the, the oils in the meat are very different when they grasp the oils. The fatty acids are, are, I believe, I can't remember what the ratio is, what it is, but the fatty acids literally changed from like Omega three to Omega six or something like that. I mean, so, so when you eat at a bison or you eat grass fed beef, the oils are healthier and, and a lot of, um, heart doctors on Dr Oz are prescribing grassfed beef because it helps with inflammation. It actually brings inflammation in the body down according to a lot of research. That's really interesting because I talked to a woman who was a chiropractor. We were talking about desks, you know, because I got a disc issue on my back and she said, besides this thing called the mackenzie protocol, it's like a series of stretches that they use to elongate the spine. She said changing the Diet is very important. And uh, she recommended a bunch of different uh, anti-inflammatories and cutting out all week. Yeah. That that, that, believe it or not, like people who are eating gluten and like that, the more and more people are sort of understanding that what you're doing is just slowly poisoning yourself with that stuff, but you can

Speaker 3:          01:11:14       handle it. That's really what's going on. And when you cut it out you're like, oh whoa. Yeah. Why don't feel so good now? Like, what's going on? Like that stuff's not good for you. I stopped eating bread and also because it's got a high glycemic index, it's Kinda like spikes your insulin. So I eat brown rice and yams and I just feel better when I do that. I do that, but yet I don't. I'm not rigid. I still will go to a nice restaurant and have locked bread with olive oil and balsamic vinegar and all the way this is salience do. And they lived to 105. I wonder how much bread they they eat. Do they eat a lot of bread? You know when you go there, you see the bread they eat. It is, it is as healthy. It's a meal in itself too.

Speaker 3:          01:11:54       It's like you see the bread up in like, oh, you got to northern Italy. I went to this place. I walked into this bread place that bread is, it doesn't look like bread. Okay. It looks like God just like a block of seeds and nuts and you're like, what the fuck are you could hit somebody in the head and they die. My grandfather used to. My, my grandfather came over here during the depression on a, on a boat. They, his family hopped in a boat from Italy and came up with a fun ride by the way. And they lived in this like seriously Italian neighborhood in New Jersey. And we used to, uh, it was almost dead by the time I got older. But when I lived with them for a bit, when I first moved to New York when I was 23, I guess 23 or 24.

Speaker 3:          01:12:34       I live with my grandfather for like a year and he would still go by his bread from this place in New Jersey. And there's some people that had been there from the 19 fifties. They had been selling bread. And this one, probably even more, I think it was actually the thirties they were there. Real Shit. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. It was just old school bread place and they would go and get the bread every day. And that's how the immigrants like dropbox, by the way, everything was homemade tomato sauce. My grandmother was always like cooking things and it was always homemade. She, they grew their own tomatoes. They turned them into tomato sauce that made their own pasta. My grandmother would be like rolling Pasta and nothing came out of screaming at my grandfather.

Speaker 8:          01:13:12       Get off me, Joe, you leave me alone. I'm tired of your bullshit. I'm going to tell you right now. I'm going to move in with my sister.

Speaker 3:          01:13:19       You feel like, oh, they would go crazy. My grandparents were Sicilian and so it was the same thing. Nothing came out of a can. My grandfather's fucking. Well, they didn't have kids to know. It's like the idea of paying for something which costs more when you can grow in your backyard. Like what? Are you stupid? My grandfather would show up with the wheel of Parmesan or we'll sit. We had a food pantry and it would sit in this big closet like food pantry, like it was do you could walk into it, you know, there's a real issue with with the cheese in this country and milk in that people want everything to be pasteurized and homogenized and that raw milk when it's from an excellent source, should be available to you, just like raw eggs are available to you, just like raw meat and it should be clear and obvious as to whether or not you're eating bad food. Like when you're eating a steak. Okay? And if you buy a stake and the stake sits in the refrigerator for like five or six days, you don't

Speaker 4:          01:14:12       get to it, it starts to get a little funky. You know? You know why that's because it's a fucking thing from an animal and it's used to be alive. It's decaying and that Shit's real. And as soon as you stop that process, okay, as soon as you step in, you're monkeying around with nature. Okay? And I know, I know. It's good. I know it's helped a lot of people get through some really dark times in this world. We're milk because it was homogenized and pasteurized. They could keep it longer and it fed people sure, but at a certain point in time, we have to realize that all that homogenization and pasteurization is not the healthy way to do it. The healthy way to do it is to eat it fresh like it. They like the healthy way to do anything and then it becomes this industry with taking this milk and changing it through this process of homogenization and pasteurization.

Speaker 4:          01:14:59       Well, what happens to those people? What if you don't have to homogenize the pasteurized milk and what will be out of business? Listen, Charlie, I've been given you a lot of money all these years. I've supported you for governor and 84 I support to you again. We've got to make raw milk Hillier so they illegal firearms, safety. They arrest people for selling Rondo. You can't get raw cheese. Raw Cheese is super fucking hard to get man because they want you to use homogenized and pasteurized milk because if it's just some joe blow farmer who has no access to homogenization pasteurization, just start selling his milk and people actually like it. What the fucking world could end. That's my problem. And and that's, that's where, that's why the only thing we should all be talking about is campaign finance reform. The idea that money in politics, as long as there's money in politics, you're going to have very powerful wealthy interests controlling even what the fuck you eat.

Speaker 4:          01:15:49       Well. Yeah, and I think it's not a bad option. This is what I want to say because if you are in a low income household and you're in a situation where when you buy a gallon of milk, like that gallon of milk needs to all be used, it goes the pasteurized milk and if, if you, you know, if it lasts for a week and a half with pasteurization, but it only lasts three days and it's raw, that fucks your family. I'm sure. And I completely understand that. So what we have to look at then, if you were looking at a holistic approach, is how do we eliminate that from civilized society? How do we eliminate people that are working in such poverty that they're worried about their milk being bad? If it goes three days like milk, how much milk costs? Like what does milk, like four bucks or something like that.

Speaker 4:          01:16:35       For a lot of people that's a deal breaker. Look, they're, they're, they're, they're really trying to put it all together. That's kind of fucked up. That's kind of crazy that, you know, some guy could be working in a job all day every day and then they take taxes out of that and then when you look at it, he still doesn't have enough money to eat natural food. That's where the food stamps program comes from. That's all those things. All those answers, that's not the answer, right? The answer is sort of a restructuring of how much your time is worth. Like what is in figuring out also how to fund some way. I mean it's the,

Speaker 1:          01:17:10       the, the, the society we live in is really sort of like a really nutty game, you know, finding your spot in that game and finding had six points from that game where you just said is finding your spots because the dea, as technology grows exponentially and our economy will start to change exponentially. There isn't. You've got to figure out how to make yourself useful and traditional labor and things is not going to be worth and stand already is this case is not going to be worth what it was when a robot can do it and stuff. So then then where does, where does a human being, where are you? What is your skill set? Have to be. My guess is you're going to have to constantly be taking classes and constantly be changing and constantly be keeping up with a, with an economy that is always moving at the speed of life.

Speaker 1:          01:18:00       You know, I mean it's, it's moving very quickly. Speed of life. That's a funny thing to say, the speed of life and that's really what it is. Like this beautiful life is constantly ever changing. And to think that somehow or another you're obligated to, to have a job. I've been a cobbler. My family were cobblers. What's going on? I can't make shoes anymore. Change. I can't change what? Either that or make some shoes that are undeniably dope. Everybody wants to go to your shoe store and buy your handmade shoes because they're so fucking bad ass. But unless you attain that sort of perfection at your craft, you're not gonna attract people. You know, you, you're going to have to find something that like. Imagine if you were like really into owning a record store and you're like, man, I look. Everybody needs records. Okay, I'll tell you, man, record store is always going to be around.

Speaker 1:          01:18:42       It's a great investment. I'm going to take my money and I put it in her records because. So let's talk about this. Economists always talk about how things become obsolete and there's always got to be there. The, the economy. A capitalist economy is based on the notion that here's how they do it and I'm going to come along and do it better for a premium. I'll come up with a better way to do what you're doing and that's the idea. You know, the, you always got a better car for you, you know, your car is breaking down. I got a better car, you know, I'll fix that problem for you. Will sort of be. I mean, we are always constantly improving things and that's one of the more fascinating things about the human condition to me. You know, I loved that. I got the apple retina laptop thing.

Speaker 1:          01:19:16       Look skinny, tiny and light. I love that. I love and you don't need any more computer than that. It's not like I can, I can follow, but you're so wrong. I do. If they come up with a new one, it's saying that, you know, it's not a huge difference. I want, once you get that, it's all unique. It's very easy now to get everything you need as far as like a visual experience or you know, or just access to information I think to try to deny or slow down the idea that we're going to continue to pump out newer, greater crazier shit and that you're going to continue to want it lustfully. It's ridiculous at this point. You know, it's fucking ridiculous. It's just, it's a part of what humans are and your attraction to it is just like your attraction to tits. It doesn't make a whole lot of sense, especially if you know you're never going to be able to touch them, but a girl was great. Tits can walk into a room and you just go, oh,

Speaker 3:          01:20:08       the whole fucking good kid. He just looked at him this round or they move when she moves and every girl in the room was pissed because she's not wearing a bra. Oh, that fucking bitch. I can't believe she's not wearing a bra. What a fucking whore. All my God. I can't believe she's not wearing a bra. She shows up in life I can think, and she's not even wearing a bra, this fucking pig. She shows up her tits or Pocan. Ask Dick in the room, otherwise known as many women. I remember when I was with a bunch of girls, I was like, I don't know, long time ago, and then this girl comes in and she had eyeliner on and she had like. She'd drawn a line around her lips. She had this. She was like really kind of. She had high heels and all the girls were like, oh, look at how gross she is.

Speaker 3:          01:20:48       She's just so fucking trashy. And I was like, that's what I call 1000 percent. This guy's type. You fucking fucking boring white chicks from Connecticut with your flat shoes and your shitty genes goes, holds those hot girls. Does it ever hold the ridicule them? Do you think they're a bad part of society? When women see girls dressing slutty or flirty, they fucking hate Boston Irish checks check. Whereas nice heels, you fucking hookah. Does your mother know you're out there sucking cock for nickels? Exactly. That's attractive hunting. I think I'll pay you and not the fucking Italian princess over there. I'll hold her back. Oh God. Where they're painted toes and her that her fucking skimpy skirt. They hate hate haters. God Sad. It's just a lot of haters out there, man. That's a sad thing that women can't express themselves the way they want away though.

Speaker 3:          01:21:50       Like I, if I, if I didn't have outlets, like, like, uh, what do you mean? You know, like if you, if you're just a dude and there was some guy who shows up, like fucking shop shows up like with his shirt off and the girls are all like, I want to have sex with that guy. And even your wife is like, I love that guy. You're right about that. That's bullshit. When dudes bring, when dudes bring their wife over at me sometimes and they'll say something like, you know, you, you're the one on New York on the list. She's loaded. What are you talking about? Stupid. Like why are you in accepting that from her? You know, why? Why don't you let anybody. And these guys were like, look, shut the fuck up. If your wife says, oh, I think British chops hot, she's an asshole.

Speaker 3:          01:22:30       Right? Right. If you're married to some chicken, she does that. Just like you're a douchebag. If you make her feel like that. If you do that on purpose, that's. That's what I'm just saying. Tish beheaded. That is a guy. You have outlets. It doesn't matter. A lot of guys are better looking. I just go, yeah, I'll make you laugh. So fuck you. Have you liked me anyway because you have a reoccurring theme. You have a reoccurring theme. We're accepting. You're like, look, I'm not this. I'm not that. I'm not this. I'm not that, but under this. No. That's a reoccurring thing like it is. It is very self defining. You know? I've been been writing script about that. Yeah, but I got to speak about that shit. Go. No Way. Started Paul Riser. Yes, he is. Paul Pfizer and Paul and no disrespect to Paul Riser. I just, I loved him and aliens.

Speaker 3:          01:23:16       That was his greatest movie ever auditioned for Paul Riser once you ever see him in aliens. Wasn't a funny role at all. It was like a really creepy guy role and you fucking nailed it. Is acting was so believable, man. Fucking. He played a real creep man and he did an awesome job. That's, that's a great role. I was amazed that he never did more serious roles because he was so good in that. I mean maybe he didn't enjoy it, you know? I mean he, he was in one of the greatest horror movies of all time. I mean, why not just cut your losses, but he went and did like a lot of comedies, but he was awesome. Just made so much money on mad about you. I think you make $50, million dollars. We had some cameramen that said Helen Hunt was mean. I've heard that people get sick.

Speaker 3:          01:24:01       They get. She probably wanted to be in theater or perhaps film won an Oscar. I say. I've actually had a couple of conversations with. Very cool. Yeah. You never know. She didn't want to be on that Shitty Sitcom that I understand. It is torture. Sixth Year. Yeah. And I would. I do not. I mean, I, I am absolutely not saying, oh poor them. To you folks out there and go, hey, I'll take that fucking job at a heartbeat and I know you would, and you're right in saying that, and yes it is a good job, but there's something about doing a really bad show that his soul stealing. Weird. I've only been involved in one bad sitcom ever done some pilots that were so bad that I was hiding in my dressing room because I need good, funny people around. If I'm doing a TV show can be shitty.

Speaker 3:          01:24:47       If I liked the people around me, I'll bear with it for a long time because the acting gets in the way. I'm just fucking around all day. I take one pilots. I probably did. I did like one one big pilot. It was an interesting one for this thing called overseas. Oh yeah, I remember that. I remember you got that. Yeah. With the, the uh, well I was on news radio and he was trying to find one guy to play this piece. Core Group of Peace Corps guys. It's like something along those funny. Actually, I thought it was funny. You know, who knows why people do and don't do certain projects or some pilots go and then other shows that are just terrible. Just stay on the air for a long period of time. It doesn't make any sense, but the process is fucking hard. It's not easy to do. It's like creating a new show and figuring out the right way to do it and the right character and you know, and then how much wacky neighbor do we need and this is not.

Speaker 3:          01:25:40       That's like a super complicated thing. It's chemistry, right? It's like a. all these moving parts have to work in. You know, Alec Baldwin said one time when a movie's successful, it's a fucking accident. And, and the reason it's an accident is there are so many moving parts that any little thing can go wrong, including the weather, including some crazy shoots up a movie theater, including whatever it might be, and if not, if everything isn't working perfectly and uses the gym, the gym carry the ace Ventura thing. He was doing the getaway. It was this huge movie. Kim bessinger him. They were the remake of the Steve McQueen thing is biggest movie and along comes and they were, they were going to be number one, not all this tracking that way and along comes this little movie called Ace Ventura pet detective and fucking just steals the whole show, you know, and he was saying if a movie does really well, it's a fucking accident man.

Speaker 3:          01:26:30       Everything's got to be as terror. Pet detective probably did greg, because they love Jim Carrey. Dude, or the fuck you want because nobody saw that coming. Nobody. Nobody saw that coming. They were like, look, we've got Jim Carrey. Yeah. What are you going to do, Jim? Good character. It does this fucking wacky over the top shit. Everybody loves it. I died. Yeah. I had so many people. I saw a critically at the time they were just destroying that movie and talking about what if he says shit, it is howling, but that, that idea that everybody needs to do the same kind of comedy is so stupid. Like you can't appreciate a wacky. I know that you like Lewis Black, but can't you like a wacky guy too? Like what do you, why are you like holding them back? How many snap, man? What about, did you see burt wonderstone?

Speaker 3:          01:27:13       How did that move? You do? I don't know what that is. I heard it was awful. Oh yeah. What is it? It's a magic carrie. And then Steve Carell and all. It's a new movie, isn't he? Didn't he get in trouble because he was making fun of Charlton Heston? Yeah. Yeah, he did. I didn't see the video. Do you want to watch it? Let's pull it up. Apparently he did some controversial video where he was, uh, he was mocking Charlton Heston who's dead and you know, one of his famous keep brushing me. No, no, no, no. From you. You know, you'd taken my rifle when he prime my cold, dead cold hands. Yeah. Well, apparently a Jim Carey took that out of context. Who apparently. Michael Morris. There's no out of context. This is out of context. When you say you'll take my rifle out of my cold dead hands. It's impossible to take that out of context. You only say that when either a, you're joking around or be your fucking psycho. There's one or two things and I think that Charlton Heston was a fucking side. There's the third thing. He was just being dramatic. Yeah, he's a psycho. That guy like guns and. Yeah, you were going to have to kill them for it. Do we have the video, the funny or die video? I think it is. Yeah. Yeah. Let's see this because I. This is the first time saying that it's hall.

Speaker 9:          01:28:29       Why did the Ventriloquist quit drinking? He was I. I'd like a room.

Speaker 10:         01:28:34       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:28:38       Well, I and how to find folks and welcome back to d hall. This is a really long video, so hold on, hold on. Often

Speaker 9:          01:28:47       it's an absolute pleasure to be here in the shade of an. He would be laughing if it weren't for the Patriots who answered the call of freedom. The aliens. It would explode our every weakness and suck the brains out of every living soul. They'd be laughing but not like you and me. They'd go,

Speaker 3:          01:29:22       this is making me dumb. Or just watch a five minute video. That six minute video people really upset about this. It was on CNN.

Speaker 11:         01:29:37       Charlton Heston movies are no longer the angels

Speaker 3:          01:29:50       masturbating with a gun in his hand

Speaker 11:         01:29:52       from his goal. That takes a trigger.

Speaker 3:          01:30:05       We're watching mental illness. This is madness that anybody put that together, watched it and went. I think it's good. Let's let this out, man. Is your allergies really fucking you up right now? No. No, no. Why? Because it's like super extreme outside right now. Like for indoor allergens or dust and dander. I don't have allergies. Meaning that I'm lucky. Yeah, I'm lucky. Yeah, except a gluten intolerance. I don't think I've ever seen a thing like watched a cartoon or something like that and been offended. Like, what? What are you talking about? How can anybody be offended? I'm offended that they stole three minutes of my time watching Jim Carrey to a guy that died 80 years. My belief system isn't that shot that I'm, you know, you're going to say something that's going to throw me into a tizzy. Well, not only that, but because there's a reaction to that where you, you.

Speaker 3:          01:30:55       I mean, he's obviously knowing that. What he's doing is sort of controversial, so in, in, in, in that, in sort of accepting that what he's doing and what he's making fun of, it's so mild because it's like the fact that he's doing it at all because what's supposed to be a controversial about it, you know, he's always to mock Charlton Heston. So you've got like this artificial like energy that you think is attached to a bit, but that's something tached to a bit for me. Okay. Because it's not controversial to me. It's not at all. So I just kind of dumb like, why are you even thinking about Charlton Heston? You're talking about a dead guy that says something weird a long time ago. Like if you were really. If you really had something to say, it should be a lot funnier than that. I agree. Like that's silly.

Speaker 3:          01:31:34       It's silly, it's folly, but you always wonder, like a guy like Jim Carey who starts off as career with that sort of ace Ventura thing. We've just, or fire Marshall Bill number that completely over the top hilarious shit. No, you can't do that when you're 60. Okay. Nobody wants to see Jerry Lewis was fucking fake Japanese teeth when he's 60 now. He didn't want to see that. You know, you, you don't mind it when he's 25 or 30. It's kind of silly and Wacky, but you, there's a transitionary period for those types of comedians where it gets weird. Shit gets weird when they're hitting 40, you know, like Emo, Philips, like sort of sort of dropped that thing, you know, he will do a thing like this where he would move all around the stage and talk, trying to crazy. I can. I can never got that. It hurts my brain.

Speaker 3:          01:32:22       He doesn't do it anymore. You can't do it anymore. Now I now he does stand up. So it's like you're, you're in your, you're in a trap like the, you, you're, you're, you're, you're looking at a beautiful flower and it ain't going to last. That's right. You better learn how to reinvent yourself right quick. It's fucking hard. Well, bobcat goldthwait eventually sort of reinvented himself. I think he was held by that sort of screaming, which is hilarious. I mean, when you nail something as good as his character, it must be so hard to let go. I mean, that character, that Bobcat goldthwait character and that he did so many fucking police academy movies. He did comedy specials. You ever seen me? You're listening to meet Bob. Who's a Sunday fucking great guy. I know him. I mean, I've worked with them. I've worked with him twice and he's a great guy.

Speaker 3:          01:33:06       He's a really smart dude who's really kind of understated and quiet. Actually. Exact opposite. He had to. He had abandoned the bobcat character. You know, it makes me laugh. Do you know one of the funniest human being tough fucking planet is, um, a. Oh God. A botox. Ha. Gilbert gottfried. The. Oh, he's very funny. Oh my gosh. We're just hanging out with that guy. Oh my God. Well, he's real old school. Legit comment. You know what I mean? He's, he's, he's been around forever. Gilbert's been legit forever. And he still, he'll still tweet ridiculous shit and get fired from campaigns and shit. And it's just because that's who he is and he's awesome. You know, I celebrate that Shit. I think that the kind of guys who say like really ridiculous preposterous shit and offensive shit, like, like, uh, Gilbert godfried and do it on a regular basis, that's why is it okay for you to have a movie where you're pretending that you're a bad guy shooting cops?

Speaker 3:          01:34:01       Why is that okay? And it's not okay for Gilbert gottfried to pretend to be some crazy man who's making fun of aids. I called them up. I called him up to it and aids for children with AIDS benefit that I do every year and I couldn't, I couldn't, I couldn't even send that to the minute he goes, Bob, that kids with, hey, stop using drugs. And he just kept saying it over and over again. I'm fucking dying. I'm not doing. I like it. He just wouldn't let me get it out. And he hung up on me. I was like, all right, well he's legit. He's the real deal, you know, he's a real comic. He's so funny. Do you know that feeling like a real comic? You know, we all have that thing where there's, there's, what is it? It's being. When you say that you guys real comic, and I know exactly what you mean, not being as some phony being you're being, you know, you, you believe the person. That's who that guy is,

Speaker 1:          01:34:58       man, I'm for better or for worse, that's who he is on stage that had been run into a comic at the airport and it's like Chucky Mc fuck-all sticks and like some, some do. That's hacking it up around all over the country and you know, one of those guys, he's just like, oh Jesus, like, oh, you'll hide your head and look down, but if you see bill burr, you know you're going to go like bell. What's up? I feel good about the world. You see God don't break. Oh, that guy's legit. That's a real guy. A real human being. I can actually have a conversation with. Well not only that, I mean, it's like when you run into them, if you run into a fellow comedian, it's like it's a, it's sort of a rare fraternity. Yes. There's not a lot of us out there. No.

Speaker 1:          01:35:38       If you get lucky and run into one when you're on the road, a language, you know, there's an intimacy there that like sort of that you know, that you can't have an experience that most people haven't had, you know, that you have. You can't really share with other people as much, you know, like, just the would be like that with everything. I mean, it must be like that for brain surgeons, you know, imagine this, be like some famous neurosurgeon and all of a sudden you're on a flight with another famous neurosurgeon. Like, oh, well do you believe you've been using for techniques and finding that stumps blood clots, you know, like it's, it seems like that would be the case with everything, you know, just sort of massage she was talking about that you find, you know, whatever it is, find what it is. It's a language.

Speaker 1:          01:36:16       I mean, you know, it's a language. Every. Everything is the language. You know, you, you get more and more fluent with things. I mean, think about what Jujitsu is. Jujitsu, language, man's physical language, you know, and there are answers to what, what somebody gives to you and, and, and, and somebody doesn't speak that language is fucked. Yeah, you know, everything is that way. And by the way, it's also part of that language is rhythm. There's a rhythm, there's a, there's a speed, there's a tempo to everything that you do and it varies on what you're doing, you know, that there's a and, and, and your personality informs what that rhythm is. You know, some guys when they do get to her fucking explosive and crazy and then other guys are really passive and just lock you up when they need to. Just all depends on what your expression of the thing it is you're doing, you know, and you can always feel and you can always tell when someone is authentic, not only because they last for a long time, but I really think human beings have.

Speaker 1:          01:37:09       You're keyed in. We all have antenna for what's legit. We all have like, like sensitive antenna for what's. You can get fooled for a little while when you're young, but at the end of the day, you know, I think we all have a sort of A. I think if you're lying to yourself, you can get fooled fairly easily. That's the thing with these scams. Most people are aligned to themselves. Most people have to lie to themselves in order to keep a job or a wife, a husband or you know, there's a little bit. Yeah, it was a lot of people that have to kind of bullshit themselves, you know, and uh, it's not even that they have to bullshit themselves. It also could be that they got on a path of bullshitting themselves at one point in time to sort of access too thick and too many responsibilities without though they've moved on in their career. They're moving forward in life. Like I knew a dude who was a, he

Speaker 4:          01:37:56       had done movies, okay, but he was still full of shit. It was like a movie star. But he would lie to you. He would lie to you about like fake kickboxing matches that he had talked to you about all these different things that he was doing. He definitely wasn't doing it. He would just make shit up so he. He had still been connected to the all this whatever, whatever negative thing that he had held onto it. He's still never realized how to let it go while he was advancing and all these other areas in his life. So while he becoming a successful millionaire movie star, he was also still a liar. You see that a lot. I know. I know somebody who's got just this like on paper, their life is so fucking amazing. They're looking lots of money, crazy, nice house, healthy, great kids, successful, and they are taking lots of anti depressants just to get out of bed because there's something fucking and it's not a chemical thing so much for them.

Speaker 4:          01:38:49       It's just this malaise, dissatisfaction, anxiety. They're always suffering from. Well, I think it's also an example, an excellent example of that super complicated machine being run by an incompetent driver. If it's not an emotional or it's not a chemical problem in your brain, if it's not a disease or a disorder that's giving you the wrong amount of hormones and it's some sort of a behavioral issue that you've picked up over the years and a pattern of you keep repeating over and over again, that's a sign of someone who was given a very complicated thing, human life and didn't know how to fuck to drive it. Just slammed it into trees and fucked it up and got hooked on meth and just went crazy with it. Didn't know what it was doing right? Instead of someone who like who had never lived in a physical form, you ethereal and nature and the universe gives you an opportunity.

Speaker 4:          01:39:40       Hey, listen, we've got an opening down on earth. If you want a, we have a baby human available loving household. Everyone is dedicated to the idea of taking this baby human and developing into a full form functional human being. So you've got an excellent support system behind you, but you're going to have to start from scratch. Okay? You're gonna know no knowledge whatsoever right out of the gate you're going to have to. People will teach you at first and then you're gonna have to develop a voracious appetite for knowledge. All in all, it's going to take about shit 30 years before you even know how to fucking do anything correctly or fit in with the other people in your realm, but hey, it's better than being gas, so what do you want to do? Do you want to be a spirit of the next stage of afterlife, fucking chance and ride a human flesh machines to the brink of the end of civilization. Come on. I liked that. He said, that's a really cool theme to write a story about. You want to be gas, you want to ride this human flesh machine. It's very possible that that's what happened. I mean, this idea of like the world being a simulation. Maybe it's not a simulation in a sense that maybe a session, maybe the whole thing is fucking crazy and blips

Speaker 1:          01:40:54       in and out of realities and maybe you are some sort of gaseous sole form in another dimension and then you live this life as a person and then you pop out the other side and and or some other thing that's so crazy. You can't even imagine it right now because it's not in the realm of experiences that a human can possibly experience on this earth. So much like having a crazy six grand mushroom trip until you've done it. You don't. You can't even imagine what you're talking about here. You can't imagine it and so when you talk about it, you're just talking nonsense. You just making noises with your mouth. So when we leave this and move to the next thing, if it is, if there is such a reality and it's possible that the next thing will be so fucking strange, you can't even imagine like instead of thinking about ourselves as this disconnected a human being, driving around in cars and using the Internet, the next thing could be no physical body at all, but, but just constantly connected with a tangible feeling of contact of other entities and lifeforms and souls and pattern.

Speaker 1:          01:41:57       It's almost like being part of the Matrix as part of the Internet, right? I mean, if you think about that, that's certainly what I'm just listening. I'm listening to fucking all the socrates and they says, you know, you're, you're kind of in prison by this body, this body that kind of breaks down this body that distracts you constantly with your appetites, with food, sex, and just pain, sleep and all the things. And it distracts you from the work at hand. The real work that did this contemplation on, on, you know, the truth. Getting to the truth of the essence of things. And, and, and it's true. It's like, if you think about it, the idea is he says, he as he was dying, he goes, look, man, I spent my whole life trying to separate myself from this physical body, like I treat all my appetite's with quiet contempt.

Speaker 1:          01:42:40       And he says, finally I get to be rid of this shit and, and just be a mind. And he was like really looking forward to. It's kind of profound. That's a great statement that he treats all of his appetites with content. That's a great sense, right? And so many intellectual sort of share that they call it the hair loss, the first journey, your hunger or your sexuality or as it is a distraction. It is, it should be treated with quiet contempt as you know it should, it should be treated as the last fucking gasps of a fun life. Jesus Christ. We want to just sit around with no boners on your couch reading a dumb book. But the idea is actually getting to the essence of the truth is more fun, you know, but uh, and it's, you know, it's, it's, uh, it's getting the essence of the truth is more fun.

Speaker 1:          01:43:24       But ultimately, if you are to believe that this is a temporary existence, it's fruitless. Doesn't matter. Well, that's what she'd been enjoying this ride. That was aristotle's rebuttal to socrates. Aristotle said, yes, yes, we should try to strive to be just a mind. But by the way, watch a woman give child birth and you tell me we're not physical fucking beings. We're physical beings with appetites and you can get yourself to a point where you feel really good physically and mentally. So why not do that? You know what I always say when it comes to socrates, this is an important

Speaker 3:          01:43:52       one to repeat whenever anybody says anything about soccer too. So you should always include. Yeah. And you know, he fucked a lot of dudes. He actually didn't invent. Yes, I love all his friends. Did you fuck some boys soccer days folks? And one of the things that Credo always complained about as he tried to seduce them and citizen because he was married with two kids and he could never do it to do so. No creative, try to seduce them. Socrates, socrates, they talk about that motherfucker stand there during the war and he used to. He could nobody, nobody. They said with Dan, lack of sleep cold and lack of food better than socrates, nobody can drink more wine and stay sober. And one day he stopped and he started thinking and the soldiers, garlic shitty town of he's thinking and they all sat there and watched him think and they took bets on how long he'd stand in one place.

Speaker 3:          01:44:37       And pretty soon the stan started to come down and they pulled their fucking cops out to watch him sleep. And he stood there all fucking night figuring out this problem. The answer to an issue. To me, meanwhile, I bet that's a lie. I bet that never happened. I bet. Exaggerate the shit out of everything. Remember talking about, in fact, I didn't even know them. We did that about my talk when I'm saying we all do that, but our teacher's like, Oh yeah, your fight teacher. The greatest, you know he can jump over trains. Right? What studies this Kung Fu with allows them to kill Moose with his fucking bare hands. Yeah. Who knows my. When you get to those kind of stories, it's like, God, what really did happen? Who is who is responsible for writing down the actual events of the time and it's funny because if you just go with human nature, we would always think, yeah, what's wrong with a little elaboration?

Speaker 3:          01:45:29       I'm going to spice it up. Good for the Romans. Look, we did a great job. We brought them civilization and no, he didn't kill that many babies. They say we killed babies. Like whatever, man. There are people with insane powers of concentration that can sit and not move for 24 hours. Yeah, they're, they're, they're autistic. Yeah. Well, now that, there, there, there are people who like somerset mom wrote a book called the stone arguments man, bro, Bro, I got this one. You're actually, you're actually, if you're intense, you'll play quake for 15. That's why I won't play it. That's amazing. You've always been insanely intensive. I said I remember I said, hey, you should try golf. He, I'm not fucking playing golf. If you get into it and it'll be over. No, no, no, because you'll go crazy. Yeah. If I. If I got into golf and started taking lessons, I would play golf all day.

Speaker 3:          01:46:19       That shit takes a long time. Like if I could play pool, you know you can play pool for a half hour, right? You can go and you go, hey, I got a half hour. You wanna hit some balls around and you can enjoy yourself a half an hour office, five hours every time you do it right. You gotta walk, you gotTa follow that, take a cart. Whatever you gotta do you gotta drive. Then you got to follow. You're hitting this thing and it's fucking. Why do you tell your car? That's kind of a bitch mode because I get exhausted playing golf because some shit. Some things make me feel like I have diabetes tagged with my five year old and fucking and fucking golf. Some shit is just too. I don't know what you're talking about. Jujitsu

Speaker 4:          01:46:50       and kettle bells. I'm not one of those chimp kettlebells. Do that shit right now. Walk though and play golf to golf. I get exhausted. It's too much. I walked a mile. My legs, my legs. I can't. If I'm bored, I fucking. I fall asleep. Well, you remember the steven no hunting thing, which comes out April 28th on the sports network were Brian and I went out to say what it is a sportsman's network outdoors channeling you. I loved watching Joe and I just watched it and I was so. All these great memories were brought back, but I was really impressed. I thought it was. They did it. They did a really good job. Matt shot at well, they edited it well. It was funny. Great music. By the way. This is bullshit, man. Sportsmans channel. It is a two point one rating an imd be fucking silly.

Speaker 4:          01:47:40       Liberals are going to be famous. Here's the thing. First of all, that is so wrong because it was a great show. That is a. This is the only show. Okay. If you, if you're like me and you have any, if you eat meat, okay, and you have any desire for some sort of intellectual connection to the animal that cheat. There's not a lot of people that represent you. If you're a thinking person, it's not a lot of people that represent you. In the sportsman's world. We have this idea that sportsmen and hunters are this like these idiots, these, these fucking numb minded Republican Republican robots and they're out there just fucking shooting animals because they're evil. Watch this show because this is not that at all. This is Steve Rinella who's a good friend now to Brian and myself. He's an awesome guy and a really well read individual with a deep knowledge of especially the history of the colonization of the West and and a deep love for animals, but deep love for animals and an understanding of the whole process of acquiring your own meat and the way he does it, he does it through this idea.

Speaker 4:          01:48:53       It's called fair chase hunting where he's not like, sometimes they'll like setup and I don't have a problem with this. I'm just saying this is one of the ways that people go hunting. It makes it more effective. Like you'll set out bait and the animal will come to the food and then when it's at the food you're hiding in a blind and you shoot it. That's like super calm after that. That's Ted nugent's entire show by the way. I like Ted nugent and I liked Ted nugent show. I don't agree with them on a lot of his things that he says, especially when it comes to politics and there's a lot of nonsense and a lot of his words. But I think, uh, he's a fascinating character and he's out there shooting animals and telling everybody to go fuck themselves. He shot a coyote in the head with a, with an air rifle on the show and then was like, oh look, a great coyote threw it in the back of his Ted fucking new children.

Speaker 4:          01:49:39       One with an air rifle. Yeah. Think about this. This is not, I mean this is like he's a big rock star and at one point in time when I was a kid, Ted nugent was fucking huge. Lot of cons to this day, stranglehold is one of my all time favorite. Classic rock hits the live version. You got me in that. God Damn Amazing. He's. He's crazy though, but I like them. I know I don't like me. No, I don't like everything about them. I don't like them all across the board, but Steve Rinella represents a completely different time. He's not Ted nugent's leaving bait out and he shoot. He shot three deer with a bow and Arrow in the first 15 minutes of just show the other day. I mean, I don't even know. I mean how many they let you eat that much. He's got to give away a lot.

Speaker 4:          01:50:27       He gives away. Yeah. Yeah. Hunters for the homeless are hunters for the hungry rather. But yeah, they, they, they know. They know animal goes to waste. They mean he has a guy that butchers and shit. He's shown it on the show before. That's not mean Ted nugent not doing that. He's definitely given a lot of food way. He just likes doing it, you know, and whatever man the fuck, I mean, what, why is that bad? But the guy who runs this dairy farm or you know, a slaughter and steers to make your cheeseburger, that guy is acceptable, right? Like, that doesn't make any sense the way he's doing it. Even the way Ted nugent doing it by leaving out bait and shooting it with an Arrow when it comes to eat. So fucking what? That's still way more ethical. Way Smarter. Like, why wouldn't you do that?

Speaker 4:          01:51:06       Don't you have some extra corn? What do you want to traipse around the fucking forest looking for some animal? Just leave the corn out. Shoot it. Well, what's the goal? The goal is you have to shoot it until you've been out there at five in the morning, freezing your dick off after sleeping in a tent. You fucking use bait right quick, especially if you're a hungry man. This guy, Steve Rinella, though he doesn't do any of that. His is all fair chase hunting and he's a really bright guy and we have this really ignorant stereotype that people that grew up in sort of hunting, fishing backgrounds are dummies. You know, a lot of people do, a lot of people who don't have any experience in hunting. And I think the beautiful thing about this show is you guys are fucking great writer. I mean, he's a great writer.

Speaker 4:          01:51:47       His book, very good book. It's very, he's just descriptions or captivate you. Like he's got a really intelligent way. I learned a lot from. Yeah. So uh, my parents about the difference between hunting in a blind or, or fair chase hunting. Yeah. But I was talking about something before that. I don't, I don't remember what the hell it was that's called going on, a tangent son hit. But the people that have a problem with basically anything that people do because people that have. What about all the restaurants? Everywhere you go, they're serving me. Like why are you freaking out about certain specific situations where you find meat, you know, and why is it really meet because are, what are these animals? Can they do, if you don't eat them, are they just going to live forever or if they're not gonna live forever, they going to live a certain amount of time and then what happens to the meat? Is it okay to feed it to dogs once they die of old age? Is that. Is that allowed? You know, but what? What do we do as humans to control the population? We have spent a lot of money on sterilization programs. What if our health deteriorates because we're

Speaker 3:          01:52:46       not eating as much animal protein and other countries take over and start dominating us. Marcy ran the army. Do you now, quickly, we'd be over quickly. The Soviets would fucking take over. Think Putin would standard if one, if Maurice, he became the president of the gun. They these fucking meet headed fic tree trunk. Next Russian cosmonauts would come running over and just dominate this country. She's turned into a bunch of Vegetarians. That's. We live in a hard world, ladies and gentlemen. Okay, and you can't run it on lentils. You just can't. Paula by general hugging. You can't run it on lentils. Fox, silly fucks. That's why he hasn't won. I don't think they want a metal last Olympics. I'm like, come on guys, you got a billion people I love and not making anybody from India. I love India. I love it. But. But like you're not athletic.

Speaker 3:          01:53:37       They're not as athletic as some countries. Sweden, it's got 7 million people. They went like fucking 50 gold metals in Olympics because meals are hot. One trying really hard to get laid and the only way to do that as be awesome at a sport. That's the quickest way to be funny you, but even that's not provable enough. As a young man you can't fuck with the quarterback. Guy was a basketball star. That guy, that guy, the guy who hits the home runs. That guy wins that guy. When I was a wrestler, they didn't come out to see me in my fucking single out at 125 pounds and not give a fuck about shit about that. Yeah. They didn't give a fuck about wrestlers and they certainly weren't into fucking karate guys. No, you're a karate guy. Doing Great. What do you wear? Pajamas and fucking stick your feet and people's face and how stupid that is.

Speaker 3:          01:54:23       No, we can't have sex kit out of here, but the fucking quarterbacks, they just have to beat them off with sticks and get out of here. You fucking opportunistic hooker. I'm going to go practice my sidekick. I'll be right back. Yeah. They like, what are you doing? Why do you do that? Where do you do it? What do you do that that's you. That's all you do. Not Flashing to play another sport. Even the USC and now it's. These guys were like bad asses and a lot of girls like, no, no. Those guys hit each other and their ears are all weird. What are you talking about? Those? Those guys have to beat it off with that in their circle. They share. It's crazy what girls girl just like hate each other. That is a broken bit. Doesn't want to go on a wild ride.

Speaker 3:          01:55:06       UFC guys don't get the same kind of attention that basketball football players do. Man, are you crazy? You think you like garlic? Chuck Odell in his prime. You'd never seen anything like that in the face of the earth. You've never seen fucking that guy would show up when chuck Liddell was the fucking champion in the UFC, the UFC light heavyweight champion, and he wouldn't walk into a club. He W, w you've never seen gravity like daily. He would suck in hot titted asteroids. Boom. He was like Jupiter absorbing grit. They were just hugging him, wanting to take pictures with him and hugging him, want to take pictures with them, do it. It was a swarm. It was like, have you seen that commercial for a World War z while the Zombie swarm? That's what it was. When chocolate, Dell would show up, girls would just flock to him. He's the gladiator.

Speaker 3:          01:55:49       They couldn't help the Alpha male he wanted to meet and they wanted to talk to him and the guy like literally couldn't move through the room. I've never seen anything like it hung with Mike Tyson and they say the same thing. No idea. Especially because in Vegas a lot of those girls are drunk. When you're drunk, that's when the real thoughts come out and you're like a picture with my DNA. Your DNA takes out. Give a fuck. I'm gonna. Tell him right now, suck as God. I don't give a fuck. That's my thing. I'm going to do it. It should go. Meanwhile, no girl would support that. It's like you fucking whore. They might need them to, but I don't want you to suck his Dick First. Oh my God.

Speaker 3:          01:56:25       Oh my God. He and in his, uh, his one man show, he starts by saying, yeah, if you with those coco cafe, and it's, let me get one of those two buddy in his one man show. He basically says he puts up the number. I didn't see it basically puts up the number 400 million. And he goes, I lost all that money. Oh my gosh, Dale, I made 400 million and I lost 400 million. No Shit. You know? But that's what happens. You just buy a bunch of tigers and just like fucking everything. Well, it's also the kind of mentality that allows you to become a prize fighter, that kind of mentality that allows you to be a person who risks his health and runs at men in a, in a boxing ring and smashes that brands, you know, you're thinking about the moment, man, you're thinking about training for your next fight.

Speaker 3:          01:57:13       You thinking about months of preparation, you thinking about the fight itself. You probably also have to be a little, like you have to be pretty aggro, right? For sure. But it's also like someone telling you what you can and can't do with your money. But like bitch, I'm Hector Camacho. I'll do whatever the fuck I want. I'm going to get my trio man in diamonds. Suck my Dick. Okay. Alright. So it's going to say macho man, suck my Dick. You get whatever you want. I mean if you're a champion, it's almost like you have to have that mentality to be that Mike Tyson type of a character. You know, Bernard Hopkins, like famously frugal, you know, he uh, he's just a smart disciplined guy that's still at 48 years old world boxing champion. The craziest thing I've ever. No one's ever done that before. No one's ever done at 48 years old and look fucking good.

Speaker 3:          01:57:55       He looked great. He box the shit out of that dude. It wasn't, it wasn't a close to crazy. He's a master. He's a master. He's a master boxer, but he's like Super Frugal, you know? But his style is like super frugal. That's why at 48 years old, he's still in the mix. Whereas a guy like Mike Tyson, when she says, and he fucking, he raged for a few years and then done Mike Tyson and Bernard Hopkins, they were boxing at the same time. You know Bernard Hopkins is older. Yeah. Bernard Hopkins is the older man and they were bought in. Bernard Hopkins is still a world champion, still speaks fluent is no voice problems. So articulate so articulately, does not get hit very well. Knows how to roll with things. He's never been hurt. Never been hurt even when he's been tagged. But he's been tagged by guys in drop them, you know,

Speaker 4:          01:58:41       he just starts boxing and he's disciplined is fuck. And he sticks that fucking boxing game in your face. And slowly but surely he starts to overwhelm when he beat Kelly pavlick and he goes, he grabbed him apparently, and he said, don't let this ruin you. You know, he uh, he knew he was going to be the money walk in the ring to be that good. Kelly Pavlich was a fucking killer. That's a, that's an exceptional fight. But the defining fight was Felix Trinidad because Felix Trinidad was thought to be a destroyer. I mean, people were setting up Felix Trinidad to, to, you know, fight all these super fights. Wasn't going to fight Oscar de la Hoya, he's gonna fight like a lot of different people at Felix Trinidad was a killer. He's a serious high level dangerous threat. And Bernard Hopkins blocked his fucking face off. He just boxed his fucking ears off credible and, and just shut them down.

Speaker 4:          01:59:31       And it was amazing that people thought the Trinidad was the favorite going into that fight because Bernard Hopkins fucking dominated him. I mean, he dominated him and he stopped him and it ended Felix Trinidad feel extreme. That was never the same after that fight. That was. That was the fight where he hit the wall. They say for fighters always have one fight that like even get hit one time by one. It's one punch. Usually that changes that whole mix. Well you can say like GSP was not the same fighter. He became very conservative and careful after he got knocked out by Matt Serra, well he definitely became more conservative but controls you rather than GSP, which you've got to look out and people say, Oh, you know, this is gsp slowing down or is GSP. This was GSP that and you know, is this time over or new guy's going to beat them.

Speaker 4:          02:00:20       There's always going to be a bunch of fucking killers out there. There's always going to be a bunch of scary. Johny Hendricks, Jake ellenberger type dudes looking to smash your fucking face and when you're the champ there's no getting around that. What's most impressive is that the guy has been doing this for so fucking long and when shit starts happening, like he blew out his acl, look getting injured, that is a normal part of being an athlete. It happens. There's no getting around it. You're putting your body through incredible strains and you're especially doing an improvisational sort of a thing like wrestling or Jujitsu or kickboxing where you you don't know how he's gonna move or you're going to be expiring and Shit goes wrong and you can get hurt. There's no doubt. There's no way of avoiding that, but when shit starts breaking and you start getting injured and you start thinking about the amount of hours this guys put in the gym, the amount of hours guys put in the cage, he amount of fights, amount of wear and tear.

Speaker 4:          02:01:12       It's just a matter of how long can you consistently keep up that sort of fighting intensity and all wrestling based fighting style too, which is very taxing on your spinal cord, very taxing on your knees. You know there's a lot of power in involved in a wrestling base style. Even if you're a technical guy like a Ben Aspirin, it's like it becomes a difficult style to to incorporate what's of about him though. It's gsps his ability and also there's a lot of tape on them. You can watch a lot on him. You can like. You can try to figure him out, but he fights a different fight in some ways. Every time he fights as well. It's, it's, I think, don't get me wrong. I think like a wrestling based style is definitely the best way to approach it as far as longevity, but even that it's like how much longevity can.

Speaker 4:          02:02:01       MMA is a brutal Goddamn game. How much longevity can you get a certain point in time. Someone's going to come along and if Anderson Silva keeps fighting, someone's probably going to beat him. You know, and it might be sort of a Bernard Hopkins situation where no one ever gets. I mean, he's so clever and so technical that no one ever gets to the point where they can really humiliate them, but there'll be a guy like a chat dawson who come along and beat Bernard Hopkins because he was younger and quicker. You know, there's going to be these Andre Ward type. Gosh, it's going to be the dude that, uh, Jermaine, the guy that I'm Kelly pavlock beat. I want to say Jermaine, Andrea, but that's not his name, his name. So a lot of his fights. He was the champ and he beat 'em. I don't know if that's the right box or African. His fucking name. Shit. I hate that. I got too many fucking names. My brain. But this dude, this name Andre?

Speaker 4:          02:03:00       No, no, he's an MMA fighter. Oh, well. Oh, that's right. I remember that dude. Yeah, sorry. Sorry. Jermaine. Yeah. He's actually a very talented, a kickboxing champion. I'm Jermaine Stewart. Jimmy Taylor. Taylor Taylor. Yeah. Jermaine. Andrea says, sorry. Bad ass looking dude was crazy. I saw the one tail. It's got a shaved head and the crazy ponytail he fought in the UFC, I think. Pretty sure. Um, but uh, he beat Kelly pavlock knocked him out, but he beat Bernard Hopkins twice and he beat him with speed plead. He beat him twice. He's a, he's a bigger guy and he's but pablet. Meanwhile pavlock beat him, but he was just able to out athlete. It's so funny looking at Kylie look like he like this. If you saw him on the beach and shorts, he couldn't look more normal. There's not a lot of muscle tone. He's covered with some kind of.

Speaker 4:          02:03:55       After he had his kind of thing. He had a bit of a breakdown. Then he went and got about sat too, but a lot of alcohol. Apparently. It's before that, when he was younger, he had no tattoos, you know, very few. It was just annoying. He just retired, you know, I think, yeah, I think part of it, I mean, the alcohol thing, it's very possible that the depression, alcohol, that stuff has to do with head trauma to that. Right? Yeah. And he thinks it might be as well. And so he's retiring even though he's like, he, he won recently and he looked really good too. He was in the midst of a comeback. He's a talented fucking boxer. Yeah. Yes. But getting, getting hit in the head, walking around with headaches all day. You could have done it, man. It was done. It. Keep it.

Speaker 4:          02:04:36       It's, it's not fun. I mean, I never did it to the extent that he did it though when he, he did was incredible. And he's a world champion and the amount of, just the amount of punishment that you have to go through just in the rain dude. I mean it's his Jesus Christ. Just. I mean, my main, the training ring, you know, just everyday in the gym, these guys, you know, they, they get caught all the time warm. And the last time we fought was 2012. He Won. And apparently he was a, they were setting up a new fight for them. You can get your own fucking computer. No Way. You want to see a picture of him? Yeah. What do you want to say? The Tattoo. So I'll find them for it. Yeah. He had a bunch of crazy tattoos. Man. He, uh, he went nutty and just fucking tattoo the shit out of his chest.

Speaker 4:          02:05:18       Go off. He put like haunted houses on him and shit. Rory Macdonald. I want to pull that up. Kelly Pavlik tattoos you could see like the tattoos that he has on his mind. Sam Macdonald fight GSP, but I think their training partners, um, apparently they are preparing for that possibility and they're not training together anymore. Yeah. They, they prepare on the other opposite sides of the gym. I'm going to tell him was no fucking joke. Yeah. Kelly Patrick has like a, the colosseum on his chest. He has some nutty shit if you go to the one, um, there's other ones where, you know, a kind of a good skinny. Our image of what it is. There's another one down there. If you look at it, it's got a bit of a better image. There's a couple of them. Yeah. That one was arms are flex to kind of get to see that what it is. Yeah. It's like a Roman colosseum on the left and there's some, uh, some other shit was just get, just get real random whether tattoos. He's got an angel with a bow and Arrow is great. Look at him. He's awesome looking. Is that a fighter? A bridge? He's a fucking animal man. When he was at his best, he was a really fun guy to watch nipple locking up. I'm glad. I'm glad he's retiring before it gets ugly. Mean guide did a lot. He accomplished a lot and it gets ugly for everyone. He looks haunted a little bit. Doesn't mean it looks.

Speaker 1:          02:06:44       Guys are my brothers. A lot of guys are somebody called being an addict. Uh, uh, like you always feel like you're being chased by something you know, described that he said, you know, I always feel like I'm being chased by, by some, by a demon. It's almost catching me every time I'm always running, I'm always running. Have you heard about these, uh, district attorneys that are getting shot in Texas? Some of assassinating district call. One guy was white supremacy. He had a shootout. They killed him. That was the guy who killed the Colorado, was prison bureau chief in India. Did that, caught that gun and we got to kill them. And then the, the guy who shot the district attorney and his wife, they don't know. I guess they still don't know who did it. You know, you don't even know if it's connected, but I'm sure it is. Well, it might be just a cartel thing. You don't know man. Fucking, I don't know. Wedding since 1964,

Speaker 2:          02:07:37       I think. How many? Thirteen or 33 prosecutors have been shot.

Speaker 1:          02:07:43       Wow. There was a story that came out about a cop that may or may not have planted drugs on a, on a woman because she was claiming that a judge had moved in and our. Oh, let me pull it up on woman who complained about judges sexual solicitation. Jesus. Yeah, I would, I don't, I'm not shocked at that. I mean they found a judge who is profiting off of sending kids to juvenile homes. Really? Yeah. They found a judge that was profiting off of that. He's in jail now. It's in Pennsylvania. So she's pretty sharp. Pencil. Yeah. Sick motherfucker shit know he thought because these kids had done things in the past. Fuck it. I'll just send them down the river, you know, they need it. And he was getting kickbacks. Who's getting kickbacks that more people, he would convict ascend to these juvenile homes. Some more money. They could spend more money they can get from the government and the more profit they can make. Creepy Fox. Creepy. Yeah. This is a Murray County. I don't know where the fuck that is. Murray County sheriff's office. Where the hell's Mary? You live in a serious hillbilly place if no one's. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          02:08:59       Oh, you know what I was going to talk about my, my uh, Vincent Labarbera, the guy that I podcast right now on the Bryan County show and this guy, this guy is a, is a uh, first of all he wears a patch or was that because he went snow blind three times from climbing, like fucking huge mountains like in Africa and stuff. And, and. Yeah. And he was uh, he would, he would go and like basically go to war zones. Just see what it's like. Is it really the counties in Minnesota, by the way? I'm a whatever. This guy went snow blind. Yeah, yeah. From climbing mountains and shit. He's be able to. Daredevil, did all kinds of shit. But now he's always been a high profile, a trial lawyer for like big time drug cartels. He's a huge proponent on the podcast. Talks about why drugs should be legal and stuff too.

Speaker 2:          02:09:43       Amazing. So He's, he's tried to get the cartels out of jail. He does. He just thinks all drugs should be legal, all of them. And he does everything he can to stick to the government whenever. So he handles huge or big cases like big, big time cases. Uh, the marine in Fallujah. A lot, a lot of different people, you know. And um, he's got a really interesting take on, on, you know, justice, like the, I had this Delta Force Guy I was talking about killing an American citizen and he was kind of justifying it and vince in la by Vera got on. It was like, let me tell you something. That's the biggest bunch of, you know, he, he couldn't have been more on the other side of it, the, that the US and the national defense act and stuff. We talk a lot about. He talked, he just goes to town on the fact that that is killing our country, our due process and everything and he's very articulate about it. I'm not, it's going down the path of corruption and we all see it and because now we're all on the Internet,

Speaker 1:          02:10:34       we all get to talk about it and we get to express our concerns and get to know when the government says trust me. No, well keeps happening. That's like this new thing is this Monsanto bill that just passed silently through congress without any mainstream exposure where they're, you know, giving Monsanto a, all sorts of subsidies and all sorts of abilities to, to, uh, to hide the fact that genetically modified foods are and things that you buy. It's creepy. It's creepy because it's, it's one of those things where it's all, you would hope that they would one day be.

Speaker 12:         02:11:17       What was that

Speaker 1:          02:11:19       was the whistle to your phone, dude. Fuck, that's the gay shit. I actually kinda like changed my ringer. A couple of. What the fuck was I even talking about? We're talking about Monsanto. I would hope that things would slowly start to move into a better direction. We're going to cut back on corruption. We're gonna attack it. We're going to make for a more fair society. We're going to only involve ourselves in military campaigns that are Justin and true and we're going to try to, you know, you got to change the rest of the world to change the incentive structure if you want to do that. Of course, you know, it's just weird, man. It's, it's the biggest. The biggest danger is that when you have good people behaving corruptly, when you have a system that allows for no other way to do business, so that so that your system becomes an economy of influence, that meritocracy.

Speaker 1:          02:12:08       So who you know is really how you get business, not what you can do and that's where you, that's, that's where we're headed in some aspects and you have to be very careful of that. Yeah. At least Lawrence lessig books as that. In a republic last, what I taught, which I've talked about many times on this podcast, is that's a very important book to read and, and, and what he does, he says, look, let me show you how Washington is corrupt with a lot of good people try to do the right thing, but they can't do business without being [inaudible]. Let me, let me explain to people don't know what the fuck we're talking about what this is, because this is a pretty crazy shit. It's a genetically modified food. Uh, and the thing they're calling the Monsanto Protection Act, which was signed by President Obama. They're calling it the Monsanto Protection Act.

Speaker 1:          02:12:50       What it actually was, it's, it was added to an essential spending bill without congressional hearings. So they slept this rider and the rider strips the power from the federal courts to halt the sales and planting of genetically modified foods even if health concerns arise. Wow. Wow. This is crazy. The provision was simply an industry ploy to continue to sell genetically engineered seeds even without a court, even when a court of law has found that they were approved by the u. s d, a illegally, the petition stated it's necessary to fund an unprecedented tacked on us judicial review. Congress should not be meddling with the judicial review process based solely on the special interest. Have a handful of companies. This is from a, someone's uh, I guess it was I, I don't know who wrote that. Someone.

Speaker 1:          02:13:47       Okay. So essentially they're saying is they snuck this in and people are just finding out about it now and that happens all the time in Washington. They're trying to protect the profits of this company. That's, that's the only way. The only reason why you would hide information as you're trying to protect the product, because if the, if the genetically modified foods are safe and they're in there and we find out they're safe, then we don't have to worry. But if they might not be safe and you want to sue, if you want you, you, you're not going to know. You're not going to be able to blame it on the genetically modified foods. You're not even going to know if it's genetically modified. If you have health issues that arise because of the genetically modified foods, you won't even know the correlation. You won't know what if you.

Speaker 1:          02:14:26       You know what? If you have a known issue that's come up on amongst a small percentage of people that do respond poorly to jump genetically modified foods, well you won't even fucking know because it's not going to be in the label because some cons got paid and it's crazy because the people who are selling genetically modified foods should only want to be selling healthy genetically modified foods. It is possible that science can figure out a way to produce more food that's more nutritious. It is possible, but it's also possible that they could fuck it up and when. When this, when something like this comes along and there, this is all this is, they should call this the Monsanto Information Act because all it is is keeping information secret, keeping it from people. That's never. That's not only that, it's also keep. It's also changing information in lying about what's good for you and what's not because they're setting up corruption.

Speaker 1:          02:15:17       They're setting up. Yeah, so corruption can take place. I don't know enough about genetically modified foods, but I'll give you an example, but you don't have to. Well No, I'm saying that the, the food and nutrition board, which sets the school standard for 30 million children on what they can eat because they've been hijacked by companies like Nestle, et Cetera, or the big companies that have an interest in selling their products. Coca Cola and stuff and and they hire scientists, read, read the China study talks about this, you know, I'm paraphrasing here, but they'll, they'll hide. They'll stack the deck with scientists that they basically hard to say that 25 percent of your diet can be simple sugars, which means I can. I can have vending machines in there that sell soda and twix bars and seven. That's part of your lunch. That's where when you're ignorant and you don't know how, how the system works, how the incentive structure works, you are going to pay a price for it with your health and so are your kids. So that's why I always tell people it's you can't not be politically committed. It's not a luxury you can afford, man, because what happens is it becomes a concentration of vested interests. Look at, look at Wall Street. Yes, they compete with each other until someone comes in with legislation and they get very good at hiring lobbyists. They get very good

Speaker 4:          02:16:30       at their economy of influence and figuring out how to buy the right people to keep business as usual. That's why you have to teach kids to entering the system. Now to stop that pattern, you know, they have to figure out a way to profit overall. You know the whole thing's a problem with profit as long as it's earned honestly, and you're playing by the rules. The problem is when you have companies that stack the deck, you know of course, and so, so how does that happen? You've got to figure out how that happens and why it happened, and then that's the way you change it, to figure out first how it happens. Just so transparent when something like this Monsanto thing comes up because all they're doing is keeping information. That's all they're doing. Exactly. They should never be able to keep information because if you have a good product, like let's say you're selling oranges, when you can prove, if you look at the data that oranges are very rich in vitamin C, they have healthy fiber to them.

Speaker 4:          02:17:28       When you eat an orange with your lunch, it's probably a really healthy choice. It's good for you and we have a lot of data to back that up so all the information on oranges is readily available. You can go look it up. You know why? Because there's nothing bad. There's nothing to hide. It's a fucking orange. Okay? But when you start monkeying around with oranges and mold, this is an orange that doesn't react badly to certain pesticides and this is an orange that creates its own pesticide and kills off mosquitoes. Or this is an orange that you don't tell me. Now we got a real problem because that's not really an orange. That's an orange that you fucked with and I don't know if you really know what's going to happen with that orange. If I eat one of these a day for the next 20 years, is that going to write my asshole out?

Speaker 4:          02:18:13       You know what is, what is it? Gonna? Is it gonna? Erase my memory. At least give me the information. I want to know if he's got the gene of a jelly fish because it was so, so it doesn't freeze. I want to know that executive told me everything. Show me everything. You've got to make my own choices. You can't hide information. And the idea that they would do that with our food, which is something that's. We have a health crisis in this country for sure. Even though we have access to all of the information on the back of food, all of the nutritional information isn't readily available and almost anything that we buy in the store except for like meats and things like that. But when we do that, we still don't use it. We still use that information and so many people are eating terrible food everyday and so many people are or unhealthy and sick all the time and they're essentially poisoned themselves.

Speaker 4:          02:18:57       So that's with inflammation. That's right. That's when the fucking information with readily apparent bad things to eat and people choose them. You, you, you know, you can't stop inflammation. You can't because what you're doing is you're setting yourself up so that you can lie and protect people in power. That's the only reason you shouldn't be doing it. We already have a problem. We already have a problem with people having shitty diets. We already have a problem with this weird thing with humans were stuff that tastes amazing. It's fucking killing you. Like krispy Kreme donuts are fucking delicious, but that's a toxin. Yeah. Those are like pure sugar. You go to a lot of parts of the country. It's like you and I do travel a lot. There's not a lot of access to real good food and there's access to, to, to different restaurant chains or there's access to, you know, just a bunch of fast food and some areas we can get healthier.

Speaker 4:          02:19:51       Supermarkets. You can, you can always, but even then we'd get a tomato and it's Pale. This is white fucking tomato, like what's in that type and hitting the gas chamber. That's how. That's why not only that, the genetics of the thing have completely been altered so they can keep them on a truck for a week, you know? It's a sort of the same thing that they've done with, with raw milk and I, I know and people that are screaming at, you know what we perceived the oldies, Lloyd's and people from boom. Raw Milk. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. They're going to die anyway. Look, everyone's going to die. You're gonna die too. That's not the point. I get what you're saying. I know it logically. You're correct, ethically correct. And I understand you're talking about transparency. You're talking about, I'm talking, I'm talking not just about transparency.

Speaker 4:          02:20:30       I'm talking that I'm saying that too many people are telling too many people what is and isn't okay to do. That's a real problem. And I always say that the law, the way we should have law in this country is, could you imagine clint eastwood arresting you for it? If he had a gun and he pointed at you, could you imagine the clinics? We would arrest you for the credit clinic square prints, or you're growing hemp. If you, if you could you imagine dirty Harry, where he breaks down hemp farms. Tell and Oh, we're you going to do it? You're going to make food and clothes the fuck you are getting a squad car. If anything other than that is a bullshit law. Okay. I could imagine dirty Harry arresting these cons that are getting paid off by Monsanto. I can imagine. Dirty Harry catching some scotch drinking asshole, you know, in his Senate Room, you know, uh, beating some hooker to death and he, you know, he walks in and you fuck, I got Monsanto through and yeah, right dead man.

Speaker 4:          02:21:28       You're a bad debt. And he shoots him dead man Callahan and you're happy. You're happy that he shot the evil Monsanto guy. Yeah. That's, that seems like plenty. Should might want to step in on this one. But could you see clinics with a rescue for having a, a roach in your car? No. No, of course not. He would maybe slap you and tell you. Don't be stupid. Don't be stupid kid. Michael Pollan says you can vote three times a day by what you put on your plate. Fuck, yeah, you go. That's a good point. Well, that's why I've been telling people, you know, one day the stoners are going to unite because there's a lot of a lot of bullshit out there and you need to respect the donor dollar. I think the way of the future though is probably genetically modified foods. Ultimately. Either way the future is. I don't think we can see that many people without. Without funding, we can find people with. That's what I. I don't know if that's true. I don't believe it and I think as time goes on, the origin of those thoughts is profit. I do not believe that the origin of those thoughts is because we're really concerned with feeding people because that's not something that's not

Speaker 3:          02:22:26       something that you hear from the federal government. That's not something that was taken into considerations. When you, when you look at how much money they spend on defense contractors, fucking billions and billions of dollars on a daily basis, on a yearly basis rather, and defense contractors, how much, how much they spend feeding people. Fucking zero. Okay. If they had the same resources that they put into the military and they put that into feeding people, there would be incredibly successful in feeding people so when they come along and say, we need genetically modified foods because we need to feed people. They're not trying to feed people. They're not talking about feed people. They want profit should all food, all food has been genetically modified, all of it. Everything we do, there's a difference between selective breeding and growing and genetically modifying. They are changing things at the genetic level to give them resistance to pesticides.

Speaker 3:          02:23:15       But if you're doing a lot of shit out there like golden rice, which is very hot and fast, well there's not. It's not a yes or a no, it's not yes or no. That's what I'm saying that you're right. I think that the rise of technology, even in food is inevitable. There's a good side to it and they're. There can also be an evil side to it. And I think that, um, I think the question is transparency and knowing and seeing all the data and holding companies accountable and, and realizing that technology is not a bad thing. It is a good thing. We probably, if we have 80 million people on this planet in 50 years, we're probably going to have to resort to genetically modified foods. We already are in some parts of the world. The question becomes how do you do it responsibly and ethically, the real issue is Paul risers character from aliens is that country sneaky slimy guy who wanted to bring the alien back and use it as a biological weapon.

Speaker 3:          02:24:06       Yeah. That was what was wrong with that fucking mood. That's what you call full circle as jealous. And that's what's wrong with lobbyists. That's what's, what's wrong with influencing the congress to let something like this sneak through where franken foods can be in your, your diet and you're not even aware of it or the right. I mean, that's, that's, that's exactly right. They were and even comes, oh, you know, not what you're doing. That matters. Yeah. And even people who might say, well, you're ignorant as to the effect of genetically modified foods you're in. You are absolutely right. I have not read that much about genetically modified foods. I have read both pro and con. I have heard like Carrie Santa Maria had some very good points about genetically modified foods and you have some very good points and I've, I've, I've seen like at Penn Jillette had some very good points.

Speaker 3:          02:24:51       He and I had a discussion about genetically modified foods and I respect his opinion as well. It is not that this isn't the argument. The argument is about transparency and it's about the access to information and about. And it's about someone who is supposed to be looking out for the interests of the people, allowing people to withhold information. You should never do that. You should just never do that. You should never allow someone who's selling something to withhold some weird shit that they're doing to it that might affect your health. I want to know if I'm eating it has a jelly bean, a jellyfish, a gene in it, or it's after. I want

Speaker 4:          02:25:23       to know that. Tell me everything you know, and this is sort of semi hypocritical coming from me because I'm in the supplement company, you know what I mean? I'm involved with with a supplement company and then you take the supplements you're taking. There's also, there's, there's enough tangible data on the subject that I'm confident in the results and that I also have benefited. I know that I've benefited from taking supplements I've know that have benefited. I know that my health is pretty fucking good and I know also a lot of it has to do with diet. A lot of it has to do with exercise and a lot of it has to do with genetics, no doubt about it, but I am very confident. I've gone through periods of have even made experiments where have backed off supplements and I get blood work done on a regular basis.

Speaker 4:          02:26:03       I'm pretty aware of what the fuck's going on and when my nutrients, we're all at a very high level. I function better. I just do. I know I do. I have more energy and feel better. You know, when it's all done in conjunction, but just not enough. You know, like if you, if you look at the negative aspects of that could possibly come from supplementation. There's not really enough information about that. Like how many, how many, uh, vitamin D pills can you take before it's makes you sick. You know, how many, how many people take the wrong amount of this, how many people. It's like, it's a real trial and error thing unless you're doing blood work. So I always encourage people, if you're interested in your health, you got to know what the fuck is really going on in your same ferris has get blood work done, don't take, don't take guesses.

Speaker 4:          02:26:50       He found out he was low and I think my rick acid and that's why I take coconut oil. The only place you can find, I think it's called myrick or my silicic acid. The only place you can find it as in sperm, whale oil and coconut oil. And I started taking it. I gotta tell you man, like I take a teaspoon or a tablespoon in the morning. I do, but maybe a psychological, but I feel better. Man. I feel better when I do things like the Kale shakes I want to do, but I juice Kale when I take a, you know, coconut oil is present and I know that people are skeptical. They were like, oh, maybe people are bullshitting. Maybe this is just more in placebo effect. Maybe this is like, it makes sense. It's a drug man. Treat it like it's not just that.

Speaker 4:          02:27:26       It's also like, what exactly is your body? Okay, why does it need nutrients? What is really going on? What's this some sort of a chemical process and it just stands to reason that the more building blocks it gets for repair, for a killing, you know, taking out anti radicals, free radicals for destroying free radicals in your system for helping you strengthen your immune system. All those different things. It just only makes sense that if the machine has all it needs, it will function better. It did. Did Tim Ferriss tell you? I had him on the podcast and he said he, he did. Um, he went to the blue zone and Okinawa and see where they have the one area where they live longer than anybody else. Is it like a choral thing? Nope. He said, he said he isolated. He was interested in seeing what they don't do. One thing they don't eat rice. Um, they blue potatoes, a blue potatoes. Yes. But he also said that I tried

Speaker 1:          02:28:22       to guess what they were, but he said there are a couple of things that they have that, that very important for health one, they never retire and too strong fucking communities and, and they always eat just enough. There's a, there's a saying for it. I eat just enough. I never, I never stuff but mainly they think the two main things and Malcolm Mcdowell gladwell talks about this community is fucking important for longevity, community and never retiring. Being interested in involved in something is so important for your health and it doesn't seem, seems metaphysical. It doesn't seem physical. Like you know, you can like this, this, this town, Rosetta and heart disease in the fifties, in this country with epidemic, they'd open up soldiers who are at at 21 and a lot of their car arteries were 80 percent clog. It was epidemic. They go to this place Rosetta, which is this really tight Italian community in Pennsylvania.

Speaker 1:          02:29:12       They Lard, they were all overweight and none of them were dying of heart disease. They were all dying of old age. Why? The only thing they can isolate it was the fact that they were such a tight loving community that then maybe they come from a really strong genetic stock. They're all from the same part of Italy. They took guys from Rosetta and who went to other parts of the country. They were dying of heart disease at the same rate, but when they were in this fucking community, they had such a strong tight bond within that community and so much support. They were just happy people. They were just happy people. It totally makes sense. There's a physical aspect of human interaction that there's. There's a reaction, there's something happening and there's a need for it to the point where they punish people in prison, but taking it away from them.

Speaker 1:          02:29:50       If you don't touch a baby when they're, when they're, when they're between zero and one, they will die. It's called failure to thrive. Hospitals have to have people come by and hold the babies you cannot have. They used to have an orphanage is they put a baby and they wouldn't touch it because they didn't want to give it a disease. They did that. The baby would die. That's called failure to thrive. You don't hold the baby for a certain amount of time during the day. They will die. Completely believed. That totally makes sense that we don't want to accept it as a. it's an actual tangible, measurable sort of a feeling or a thing, but it's important. Community is important. You're not asleep. You're not an island and we need each other. I mean, when I think of all the good times, and I think about that, I was watching the hunting thing that you and I go back so far.

Speaker 1:          02:30:33       I thought you feel so lucky when you have friends that you have so many experiences with you and I know each other so fucking well, you know, so well, like all the thorns and all. It's just such a and watched. We've grown up together, you know, that kind of stuff is, is, uh, is priceless. I mean everything else known you for almost 20 years now. Twenty years. It'll be 20 years. Next year. Long ass time. He stopped to think about how much crazy shit we've seen together. Yeah. And you've saved me from making some crazy decisions to, you know, you've saved me from going insane. I mean, I remember a meeting you, it was like, oh, there's one out there I could hang with. I grew up in a bunch of different places in this country. Uh, you know, from when I was a little kid lived in San Francisco

Speaker 4:          02:31:20       and I live in Florida, but I spent, you know, all through my high school years I spent, you know, in Boston and one of the things about Boston, like I lived in a suburb, Newton is he given that a lot of real guys is a lot of guys who got up at 6:00 in the fucking morning and mowed lawns before they came to school. You know what I'm saying? I mean there was, there was, there were men's men were, there were actual men. If someone talks some shit, they wanted to go punch him in the face. It was like growing up around them, it was like there was, these are normal people that I could, if he told me a story, I knew that's what happened, or at least what he thinks it happened. But I was getting mixed signals. When I came to La.

Speaker 4:          02:31:57       I was like, oh my God, this is insane asylum. I was totally ready to go back to New York and if I didn't assign a fucking lease from my apartment, I thought my show was going to that stupid baseball show. Like I was an idiot. I was 20 whatever years old to the greatest show ever. I'm thinking getting an apartment. I can't fail. And uh, within, you know, four weeks I knew it was doomed and I'm like, fuck, I got a fucking apartment. I got an apartment for a year, I want to get out of here. I was like, this is filled with crazy people and it is by the way, but I slowly but surely accumulated a group of great friends. It took forever. It's like slowly grab guys like you, okay, come this way. And then some show ideas. Look at this guy. Oh, we gotta get him, get in there.

Speaker 2:          02:32:39       It's really true. You can I come to la, la La. It's like the, you know, the first, uh, my buddy said he was from New York and he showed up at a party and he goes to this party and there's this guy in a robe with his arm around two girls on couch and he goes like this. He goes, gentlemen, welcome to my place. Make yourselves at all. He was like, get me the fuck out of here right now. I'm going to kick you in the face and we're in a fucking robe. Shit. Hell yeah, don't. Yeah, just try that in Boston or New York. See how long you last with that shit. Like, my buddy was rock climbing. We were rock climbing. My buddies from California, he was being a smart ass with them and telling them what to do. And my buddy was a wrestle. My buddy turned him and goes, hey, you don't know you. You sure as fuck don't know me. And that's the last time I hear you telling me to do anything. And everybody got quiet. And he was like, well, what the fuck? What the fuck? The Guy fucking threatened me. I go, that's right, dude. He threatened you physically because you're being a fucking disrespectful more on their guys out there that will punch you in the fucking face if you don't know how to behave.

Speaker 4:          02:33:34       There's a giant percentage of people who grow up in this coast that they don't know how to behave. Never seen a fight. What's. Even if they have seen a fight, they'd seen a fight between someone like them and some of them.

Speaker 2:          02:33:45       I'm not talking about Mexicans either. I'm talking about white guys not talking about white guys in white guys in Hollywood. I'm not. There are some tough. There's some tough. Like I know a lot of Latino guys. Yeah,

Speaker 4:          02:33:55       out here who are tough as shit. That's a whole different culture when you're talking about is actors. Yeah. I'm talking about. You're really talking about is nothing to do with white guys, but yeah, there's some tough ass fucking regular white dudes from California. Well you're talking about is actor. That's what it is. Their loans. They're fucking Limu and when I, when I first met you, I was like, oh, this guy's doing. He's normal to or you're not normal. You're certainly not normal, but neither am I or was. I was just honest about my interests, which were because I'm a caveman. Both dudes like we could talk. We were two men. I was like, oh my God is another man. I could talk to this man. You know what's, what's going on here? I was like, I feel I'm like, what's with this fucking guy? Ya Know?

Speaker 4:          02:34:35       These fucking people that were on the set with you just said, man, tv were exhausting, exhausting, trying to be funny and clunky and talking about their career. Shut the fuck up. My God. What kind of self serving noises coming out of that stupid head of yours, like you don't even know that someone's listening to you. You can't even have a conversation. You're not even a person. You're one of those weird fucking actor automatons. I came to dinner one time and I had a hat. Turned backwards was fucking cool shit. I looked in the mirror like 50 times that day because I just had this new hat. I fucking sit down there and say, well, my father looked at me and he just goes, done. I go, I'm good. He goes, yeah, I can't do what he does. He goes, why are you wearing that hat? I'm not anymore.

Speaker 4:          02:35:28       Just the way he said it, I was like, oh, I fucking, I'm an idiot. But today if you wanted to do it, you could pull it off. Fuck. Like now you're a different man. Now you're self actualized. Self realize now you could show up with a bra on and like, father you're, you're missing a certain amount of sophistication and worldliness, torture my generation. I mean I read books and wearing a, it's like you can't fuck with us and a scarf, but you could laugh about that and it would be great. But if I was 21 and I was wearing a bra, I was serious. I was really trying to wear a bra like fucking asshole. Like what am I? One of the like, you know what I mean? Like with those green, not the what of those dudes that the, the, the Guardian angels remember that.

Speaker 4:          02:36:08       Of course, dude, I remember being in Boston and they just made it to Boston were raise, but yeah, they were in New York for awhile and they just made it to Boston and the guy was walking around who's guardian angels, a t shirt on and this bra on and he's walking and I look at him and I'm following him and I'm locking eyes. When he looked at me and goes, fuck you. He gave me the finger and I'm like, well, I didn't even say anything. I didn't even say anything. And you are a fucking guardian angel. Really? And then the guy who was the head of it, who is a, a radio dj guy now, he like faked a rape. He faked a where he helped someone and he got shot, you know? Yeah. But there was something that he faked. Hold on, I'll pull it up. I don't want to slam over young man. Curtis Silva, I think his name is. Yeah. Fake story as quick story started. The uh, yeah, I think that was horse shit. Yeah, I think, uh, I think that my courtesy was history of lies and publicity stunts part one. Ooh, that's not good year.

Speaker 4:          02:37:17       He admitted to creating and perpetuating at least six hoaxes over the years between 1979 and 1980 according to the December 14th, 1992 issue of people magazine because that's. Remember when he got in trouble and the article sibyl recounts a October 1980 publicity stunt where he claimed he was kidnapped by New York City transit police and told if the Guardian Angels Don't quit patrolling the subways, they would kill him. Everyone was against a silver plate and explained the mayor of the cops. Even the public. We just needed some good attention. Oh, he's a fucking scam. Artists, you know, if you're a scam artist once you're a scam artist forever. Fuck you. You know, this is just, this is what he's doing. I mean, I guess, can you bounce back from that? Sure.

Speaker 3:          02:37:58       I'm going to try to do that with my standup. Somehow. I'm going to be like, I got arrested for making people laugh too much. They were pulling people out on fucking out on stretchers. This guy would have to bounce back

Speaker 4:          02:38:07       long way though, man, you know, he would bounce. He'd have to bounce back a long way because this is. He's had another guy I worked with them who claimed that a fixed several incidents, including highly publicized rape of then wife Lisa Silva, Jesus, whatever it is. Yeah. He's a. any fake that too. Yeah. Wow. It's. Well, they have a cabin. They did shoot him, I think in the legs or something. Yeah. Well, whatever it is. I mean, who knows what happened. He might have paid someone to do something crazy to him. Who knows? Maybe it was just. If you're doing this many bullshit publicity stunts, you're probably a really annoying guy. Somebody will eventually actually does want to shoot you. It's really annoyed at you. Silly Bitch. But if I was wearing that Bra, yeah, yeah, smack me. Well, if I was 21 smack me. You're not allowed to wear a bra. Yeah. Even today, I can't pull off a boy. No, nobody can.

Speaker 3:          02:38:59       All right. Unless you. Randy coture, unless you're a green baret, unless you're a green beret or in the French Foreign Legion that you can wear a bra if you're in a Gi Joe to some does. He does the new Gi. Joe, does he have a brewery? I think one of the guys like Falcon or something. If they're done well, like I went to turn on teamwork around. You've got a machine gun in your French or you're in the French Foreign Legion or something. You can actually. You look pretty good. You have. It is kind of. Isn't that kind of funny that you're like, if you're a killer, you're allowed to wear a bra. Like that's when you're allowed to wear the silliest hat ever. We want you to wear the silliest had ever because you're our best killer. Like why don't give him a cat in the hat hat? Imagine that the fucking seat instead of the Green Berets and see that cat in the hat's just.

Speaker 3:          02:39:42       They're so gangster. They don't give a fuck. If you see that. Hat's the Kombucha. This is pretty funny. Here's a. here's a screenshot. Gi Joe to the characters, and then we got. Hi Guys. I'm wearing a bra here. He doesn't look back. No. The Brian keeps saying that he has gay accent. Just stopped doing that voice. That's Dennis Quaid. It's so dumb. He doesn't sound like him and you can't keep repeating it. It's not funny. It's not true. Agreed with me and nobody agreed with you owe people that agreed with you. Just wanted to talk to you. They just wanted to reach out to you on the Internet. There. Isn't that crazy test a bad dennis quaid. He's not. He doesn't. He doesn't think Dennis Quaid sounds like a a, a South Park character really? Well, what he did sound like in that movie, you're talking about that today after tomorrow was totally fake it.

Speaker 3:          02:40:27       That's absolutely true. It was like a. It was such a super fake movie. That is his acting sucked. It was. It was a terrible movie. I mean the day after tomorrow, it's. It's almost impossible to do and not be ridiculous. What have you seen that you love besides les miserables? What have you seen that I got injected, injected into my asshole with a laser beam. I didn't. I wouldn't watch on the screen. I want to experience it through my central nervous system, asshole first. And uh, I love you. I came, I came in my own mouth. It's my, my calm. I opened my mouth and it was like crescendo. The jet came out of my cock that was the exact shape of my mouth on the inside and it went in seamlessly. It was an air tight airtight seal gallon of calm, just like, like, like a wiffle ball bat suspended from the tip of my dick out in a fan shape of my mouth and went right in the hole.

Speaker 3:          02:41:27       You haven't, you have to sit through a fucking musical. One time I remember you told me what was like, he goes, it was a murderer. Attention on my murders, assault my attention span. Yeah. I had a friend that was a in a musical and we all went and we watched the first half and then I was like, what do you guys think? And they're like, well, I think she's doing a really great job, but think it was awesome. And I said, that was a fucking murderers assault on your attention span. How dare you pretend you'd like that? Nobody could possibly like that. When you're watching nonsense, you're watching songs that suck for no reason. Someone's singing songs for no reason and those songs are fucking terrible. This shit doesn't make any sense. Shut your mouth. You shut your mouth. You're not enjoying it. It'd be weird if I started singing now to tell you she's what?

Speaker 3:          02:42:11       Joe, y'all my friend that was like, they drop their jaw so I get embarrassed when I eat. When I see those things were all of a sudden the guy starts to sing. Well, what about the time that you had an acting class? Brian and international. And it was in the. Did I? Okay. Was Brian and acting class? And it was, he had a, the teacher was singing show tunes and Brian called me up and he says, you have to come to this. My teacher is going to sing, show tunes. London's it. So I, I went, I found Brian and me and him just like cuddled up like a couple of retards, like, oh my goodness, this is the most ridiculous thing I've ever seen. He was singing, he was a, you know, he was a guy, he's a great guy, but he just loved show tunes, fucking love them and, and, and very straight.

Speaker 3:          02:43:04       And uh, I was, I was so fascinated. I was like, you love musicals. He loved them. You know, I sat through a musical, a musical theater class, you know, that. Did I ever tell you that your teacher, was he? Yes. I was so obsessed with. So I was like, I gotta see who loves this stuff. I, I get obsessed with that stuff. I see in the insanity and I'll get involved in it. Man, I enjoyed it. I enjoyed it. Wrong reasons what you and I had a great fucking time then, right? It was really a good laugh. Yeah, he was great. I had the lyrics of his song stuck in my head for so many years because it was so bad. It was like show tunes though. She says, may you have a training when you are thirsty and needed really literal songs on the nose. Really bad it was, but it was like one of those where it's like, she's gone away.

Speaker 3:          02:43:51       Me, you have a Sun News Da, you have a hug when you need a hug, we should do a music. Oh No, we shouldn't ask. No hunting now. I really enjoyed the book of Mormon that was allowed. It was great. It's really good, but I liked their movies better. How about that? How about that? Even even even the best case scenario when a bunch of people are singing theater guy now south like South Park, the movie is still to this day, I think like one of the greatest comedy special or comedy movies, et Cetera. Thirty call me up that, you know, I've never seen it. I'm like, God, that's so crazy. Team America never. Oh my God, I have to write what is wrong with you? I'm going to do that. That's what I'm going to write that down. Yeah, because and it was because it was so ridiculous in team America was also a musical.

Speaker 3:          02:44:45       There was a lot of musical elements to it. It was like a, it was a little bit of music and then a lot of acting sort of like, even like the book of Mormon. Isn't that the one where Sean Penn got really mad at them for making fun of a. didn't have a lot of things that. Come on, Shaun, you got to take shawn uptight. He needs a hug. Well, it's against. He's a fucking actor. There's no getting around that man. The best actors, the most, the coolest ones to hang out with are still not nearly as interesting as your average landscaper. Right? So fact, why am I podcast? I never have actors. I always want to have like, you know, other people, like somebody who writes a book or a or a soldier. I don't know. Somebody, a lawyer, you know, it's more interesting to me.

Speaker 3:          02:45:22       Yeah, I remember I was listening to an interview and uh, I think Brad Pitt's an awesome actor, no doubt about it. But it was like I was listening, I was like on CNN and I wasn't paying attention on care and I was like, who is this idiot that Larry King's talking to Brad attack? It doesn't mean he's going to make them believe. And that's what it doesn't mean he's got charisma is great to look at. It doesn't mean I'm going to listen to his point of view on life. I, you know what also I think that the, the ability to transform yourself into another person like you know, doesn't necessarily lend itself to you being in an eloquent public speaker and representative of, of your craft. A little. Probably a Weirdos like, oh, you mean because Daniel Day Lewis lived in a log cabin with no electricity through the whole time he shot Lincoln.

Speaker 3:          02:46:07       Hey Dude still sucked. That's gotta suck when you do that, when you spend so much time. Still the fucking shit out of him with the box. We trained for three years to be a boxer. For me, I got good and I watched. I was like, well, you could've done the movie without being a boxer. Actually it wasn't. It wasn't that it wasn't like the deciding factor, but it wants to him, man, he is that guy. Christian Bale said it the best. They said, why do you lose weight or you've put yourself through all this crazy shit. He goes, you know why I do that stuff, dude. I make believe I wear makeup for a living. It doesn't make me feel like a man, so I got to make it really fucking difficult on myself. It was great answer. Do it needs a hug too. They all need hugs. Okay, mark and mark doesn't have that a to and looking at me. What you guys want? Attitude and you want to laugh. You come to San Antonio, Ella, laugh out loud. Comedy club Friday, Saturday and Sunday, lol, lol, and listen to the 10 minute podcasts and Brian Cowen show. I'm out 35 because that's a good way to end this thing. Let's fucking wrap it up. This or this. Saturday night, I'll be in Indianapolis, Indiana with young Tony Hinchcliffe. Take it. Tony out in the road break is a little comedy. Booty break is cherry and he's chairman.

Speaker 3:          02:47:20       Cliff Pricey. What is that? That's how you spell his last name. Oh, silly. Um, so that's a, that's a Saturday night. Indianapolis News, New Brunswick, New Jersey. I'm pretty sure it's sold out. And I think San Jose sold out too. So Sam, Shawn Rogan, Joe Rogan experience. That's my walking dead voice every time I see you. And then I see me. We've set something. Could've been brothers. Oh easily. Well everybody in my house by the way. My parents watched the mediator episodes they want to because they were kind of freaked out about Michela dear. A little. A little odd to see them watch those it with a hatchet, like chip open the fucking rib cases. Pretty intense stuff. But um, they were like, do you guys look like the closest two brothers you ever have? Like as you get older you really look like brothers. I kept, like I was saying, is that job or that strange?

Speaker 3:          02:48:09       I'm better looking at times a little sexier. You're a little sexier. Rogan.ting.com. Pitches go there. Save yourself $25, put it in your mouth, putting your mouth and his balls. That doesn't make any sense. I'm sorry Tim, you don't deserve that for your commercial Rogan.ting.com. Go there and save yourself to $25 off either a phone or service. An excellent company that supports the podcast so police support them. We were also brought to you by square space and uh, I think it is squarespace.com forward slash Joe. And I think, uh, I think it's the code is joe three right for now. Probably Joe Fournier. It doesn't work, dude. Joe Three. Yeah. Be Creative if it doesn't work just to figure it out. Your dirty fucks, but go to squarespace and support them. Easy, easy website setup and awesome.

Only people who listen to this episode will know about this. Register that. Hurry quickly use hover to register it. I want often butthole.com. Don't get.org because then you can't profit legally.
