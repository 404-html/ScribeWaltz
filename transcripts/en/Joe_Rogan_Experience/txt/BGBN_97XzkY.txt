Speaker 1:          00:00:02       H J o with the pants. Anjo pants hand John. Did he just make that up? I'm just waiting for the right fucking time. That's hilarious. All Right Ladies and gentlemen, this is now where it's official. Yeah, I said it sounds professional. Someone who said, I have a radio voice. Oh, Donald Cowboy was like, uh, I, you got a radio voice and that's your radio voice. Donald Cowboy Cerrone. He's a guy fights in the UFC and he was here for the podcast the other day and he sent me, accused me of having a radio voice. Now think about it. Fuck do I even delicate voice. Why is that a bad thing? That's a compliment. Well, I recognize that the instrument has a bunch of different sounds that it can make. What is, what is one of the reasons why I appreciate music? I appreciate music. I mean, I've told you the guys this before, like one of the things I love about what you guys do is I have zero talent. Like I love something that I have now. Like where I don't know anything about it. I love music. I'm a huge fan. I know nothing about it. When you guys started talking about bars and notes and I'm like Blah Blah. I have no idea where you're saying we don't either.

Speaker 2:          00:01:07       Do you, are you like, cause you use her voice a lot, you know when you're on stage and you use it in different registers and, and you, you know, you podcasts. Do you like, have you ever had problems with it? No. That's amazing. Screaming too. I know you hear a lot of Comedians,

Speaker 1:          00:01:23       I think. Well you could do it without fucking use your thing up. Well the UFC is the weirdest one. I fucking scream sometimes. I don't even know I'm doing it in Tom doing it. Like sometimes I'm standing up, I don't even know him up. Like I'm standing up, I'm doing cart. Like there was a, our Lawsky um, and um, uh, Travis Brown fight this crazy fight between these two giant guys who are painting the fuck out of each other. They kept getting dropped like over into like our Laskey dropped him, but I think three times and he kept getting up and then he dropped our Lawsky. And there are lot of came back and knocked him out and by the end of the fight I was standing up screaming and I just shut it off. I had to realize I didn't and my pants first, I didn't know I was up until I was like, well was fucking standing up. I don't even know. I've, I've only done that a couple of times, right. Just all of a sudden I'm standing. Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:02:09       The fact that you can scream and you don't lose your voice I think is remarkable because it's like, I bet back when I was bartending, I lose my voice all the time just from trying to, you know, raise your volume. And so yeah. But when I, when I quit bartending, my voice went up like an octave and I had it, but I had to go to speech therapy. So I learned all these things about like how old were you back then? Was that when you set up an octave, does them, is that like there's a, an actual nurse for singing? I wasn't like speaking in enough that

Speaker 1:          00:02:38       well those old ladies that you hear about by the old bar lady, who's that girl sue Bob from the whites of West Virginia, they Budweiser. Boy. I always been the sexy one in the family. If you've ever seen that, you haven't seen it. Oh God. Oh my God. No, you've never seen it. Never went. The wonderful whites of West Virginia got everyone talks about, oh my top two. Tell us about this mosque. Nashville.

Speaker 3:          00:03:00       Everybody required viewing. Who wants to be seen? You can't shut the fuck up about it. Yeah. Cause you're like, Yo, I think it was, wasn't Johnny Knoxville was it his amazing, amazing. It's just a really well done documentary. Not just freaky people, but it's all that bar, that bar voice. They got that bar votes. Yes.

Speaker 2:          00:03:18       Sega ranch and Jeremy and cigarettes. Booze and yelling and there's a, there's a sexiness to it though. There's like, there's definitely like a, Oh wow, that person has fun. You know, and I, I, I've definitely like I, I like having a raspy voice but also like no, that it's just damage. So I'm not super pumped about it. At the same time, really attracted to voices like that. In general though. You listen like Otis Redding. Yeah. He's got a battered fucking voice. Yeah. Janice Joplin. How about Petkoski? Okay. That was of his half of his thing. Barn and do this. Yeah. When you trust that this thing like, oh yeah, yeah, but I also think it was his like good way of thing. It's like some people have that incredible ability to like channel there person through this incredible voice like Bukovsky or something like that and like, you know, so they're easier to listen to.

Speaker 3:          00:04:07       Well, bootcamp skis, poems were always just raw and interesting, but there are nothing like when he read them, especially when you saw it, there's like for him, he's one of the rare poets that I think the visual aspect like enhances it significantly. Like, I would love one of my favorite, uh, there's a, a, a bunch of videos of him, uh, at like these readings and he would sit in front of these audiences and we drink wine and knew would get fucked up. And if people were talking, you would yell at them, I'll come over there right now and I'll beat the fucking shit out of you. And he was this old drunk man, but he was just, and he really would have Donna theaudience and fought people. And then he would read this like really intense stuff that he wrote about life and mortality and his, you know, vision of humanity. It's so hard to get people to care about poetry. So I think that's how you do it, kind of. It's Adam, you Kinda, you're taking such a crazy chance to even say you wrote a poem. They tell someone hammering home, nobody goes, yeah, the fucking awesome dude. That's, he knows most of the time when someone says, uh, I've, uh, wrote a poem, I'd like you to read it. Like, Nah.

Speaker 3:          00:05:23       Like if someone says they have a song, I'm like, oh, I love songs. Someone says, Dude, or the best joke, oh, I can't wait to hear it. I got the best poems, poems, it. Sure. Oh Man. Right. The best poet of the bore and the best poem is a chore. The best, the very best little poetry right there. Just write the small work and lay that shit on us. But when people, when there is a visual element, it's amazing. You know, Spalding gray. Yeah, yeah. That's, yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:05:59       Ooh, I don't remember. I don't know. But he did that swimming to Cambodia stuff and it's him telling these stories and it's really poetic. Um, I'm not, but it's a storytelling element. You don't all of a sudden we want to listen to, I want to listen to it. I think it's fucking, how about Eric Bogosian? I Dunno who that dude is. He, I think, um, I think, yeah, Spalding gray. I did do that. He was having some health issues and he wound up killing himself. But Eric [inaudible] goes, he was a guy who, um, actually he was doing like more like one man shows. Well that goes, you always had a bunch of movies for a while, but he, he actually did some acting too, but he did like these one man show things I want to see. He was a reading, I want to say. They were like really well done readings too that he did.

Speaker 4:          00:06:45       But Spalding gray was guy was like more known for it. Right. Cause he sat down at the table. Yeah. He had his desk and even had like a real theatrical vibe lights would be going on. Yeah. It's sad when you hear about a garlic that killed himself cause you're like fuck dude. You know all these people liked you when he died. Well he was famous enough that we're talking about yeah. And that community, I'm sure he's, he was reasonably well known for sure. And at the time he had been on TV quite a bit, which is where Ben and I probably saw him first. Right. That's why I'm on the Youtube. Um, cause he had got series, like who's the filmmaker? Um, guy did a lot of concert films and I can't remember his name right now, but in the 60s he was, he was at like a, he was taking Hendricks footage and he was taking a lot of festival footage in the 60s, which nobody was really doing at that time.

Speaker 4:          00:07:36       Or at least nowhere near the rounder stuff. Lomax Lomax. No, he was molded great. I think his heyday was like the 80s, late seventies, like swimming to Cambodia was 87 but who's the guy who did the film with Cambodia who directed it and see here, hold on cause he did this. Um, I think the Toronto Peace Festival, this fucking amazing. Jonathan Demi. Demi. Yeah. I swear you go home. You're faster than me. Bastard. I have it too. It was trying. Yeah. Um, yeah. So you, yeah, that was a, he was apparently it was about his participation in the movie, the killing fields. I didn't know that he had anything to do with that. Yeah. When all these beautiful stories, I mean it's not much about the production, it's about his experiences. He just Kinda like took shit pretty, he was an extreme or kind of like a radical liver right now and just a great storyteller, which is super rare I think. I mean it seems like mainly that rent, that's kind of the comedians realm now. Like people don't give a shit about storytellers, but people, if you're a comedian you could tell us a story. Well, I think in a way the problem is like trying to sell this just like we're talking about like selling poetry, selling a guy who's like doing a one man show or one man story. It's hard but essentially like a lot of podcasts

Speaker 1:          00:08:56       are like that. Yeah, we're stand up, stand up, stand up can be anything and a lot of ways, yeah, but the, I think the idea about standup as though you're going to try to be as self indulgent, like only you, you try to be as little self indulgence possible. I'm that's the wrong way of phrasing that does the least amount of self indulgent humanly possible and the most amount of entertainment for the people that are listening to the most amount of self deprecation, the most amount of laughs that you can get out of it. The most amount of humility and approach to the lab so you don't make people uncomfortable. Like there's all these variables in achieving the laugh and achieving the laugh is like the proof that you're on the same level and then they appreciate your sincerity and then you're, you're funny and you're hilarious. That's all working together. So it's all like this, like dance that you're doing to achieve a result, whereas you don't have to have a real result with one of these fucking things.

Speaker 4:          00:09:52       You know what I mean? Would have, you would think, but the amount that aren't like to get it to that polished diamond state requires a lot of disciplines. But how am I saying about stand up, stand up. You eat dick on stage. It just balances it out. You can't, it's just too hard. The bombing was too hard on the soul. You'll, you'll come around to writing the best shit you can. That's it. Did I really think there's a level of bravery and stand up that is not really involved in music. People just don't judge you the same way you know thing to quantify because I think there's a level of bravery and being a soldier, that's a lot tougher than the lower there, but none of those people are here deeper and deeper though. You know what I mean? There's your referral of bravery when Krogers save the earth either.

Speaker 4:          00:10:38       You're right. I mean just always going to be, everybody makes their effort in a different way, you know? Definitely the physical structure to be a soldier and the brain power, emotional power. Do you think you'd go over and kick some ass for America? I think, I think I could save myself not to Cincinnati. I'm not wearing parts of Ohio national guard. All of America since Cincinnati and Cleveland. Did they have a rivalry at all? Like if you said gas for Cleveland does people in Cincinnati or they're going to hate on you now and next time you're there, it's really Kentucky versus Bangles browns versus Steelers Brown's versus ravens. Those are the, that's the Trifecta of difficult times in, in that region of the country. But I'll be honest with you, I love playing in Pittsburgh. I love playing in Cincinnati and every time I'll have fun, harmless banter about our sports teams. We say the same about Baltimore as much as like Baltimore is a great town, but we only really went through there once and we literally stopped to eat dinner and found crack on the ground.

Speaker 3:          00:11:55       We've got to build belts. I know, but we want to come play there and get help us have to take some time. Don't be a hero. We're talking about the amount of bravery it takes to be a comedian. Pretty radically. Baltimore. I had this guy, Michael Wood, who was a cop from Baltimore, had him on the podcast. Oh Wow. He was a retired cop and a young guy too, you know, just a massive shoulder injuries. Shoulder blew apart. They put it back together and and blue a party and he had to retire, but very intelligent, articulate dude and very compassionate and outside of the police department now you know, still a young guy. What was he like 35 or something like that? Maybe younger. Did he get shot? I forget what the injury was, but he had to get shoulder reconstructive surgery and then it still, it still didn't take and it was like a shoulder's fucked.

Speaker 3:          00:12:45       Like he apparently was in a high speed chase and shoulder just blew out, was turning the steering wheel. It's pretty, it's pretty fucked up. But point is like he was talking about how crazy Baltimore has always been. If they found some directives, I guess it was from the police department from the 1970s. And he's like, me and these other cops are reading this. We're like, Jesus fucking Christ, we're running, we're chasing our tails. Like this is exactly the same places where the exact same crimes are going on. There's a specific reason for that. And that's because there was like literal like, like constitutional or like city ordinances of, of segregation and, and consolidating these neighborhoods and having them be specifically black and you couldn't buy a house in a certain neighborhood if you were black, even if you had the money, you know, it's, it's the whole, it's the whole tier is like, they were just built to fail.

Speaker 3:          00:13:36       And the reason that crime was flourishing and thriving so much is because they didn't have a fucking chance. I mean, it's like the, uh, I listened to NPR podcasts a little while ago that explained how, um, when w was it, the 60s boom is post war post World War Two, post World War II, these housing ordinances for the vets and things like that. And they're like, hey guys, welcome back. You can't live here. It's pretty brutal. It's awful. It is pretty awful. I didn't even know about that until a few years ago and it seems like, who do you remember who brought that up? Someone brought that up on the podcast and we like what we had to look into it. Do you remember who it was, Jim? No, it's the same with education too. I mean it would be like all of these, um, you know, schools that just wouldn't let intelligent African-american's in and you wouldn't get the education that you wanted or deserved or know could achieve. And it was just like, you know, you're kind of stuck in this box, which is those neighborhoods, you know, they were, they were made for that. It's total, it's so fucked up. There's so many levels to the whole thing. Like first of all, the level of overcoming slavery. Like you ever heard a white guy saying, God, it was so long ago, fucking get over it. You know the Jews, I've, I've heard white guys say that and you go, okay, it's not

Speaker 1:          00:14:52       that long. A hundred years before what she was just talking about it. Yeah. It seems like it was long. Like I have a 1965 corvette when that corvette, when it was made a hundred years before that almost exactly. Slavery was abolished. That's fucking crazy. That's insane. Yeah. That might be one of the most bizarre things. A hundred years is not my, my wife's mom died recently. She was 97 like she was a hundred years old. Wow. So from the time did she died too? Like, like realistically she could have been alive while fucking slavery is happening. Oh my God. Yeah. I mean it's real listed. Like that amount of age. You could have someone from 1965 and they, if they were that age they could remember fucking slavery. Yeah. That's terrible. Oh God. God Damn. That's like when I was born, I was born in 67 so I was born two years after that. Like that is to me when I put it in those terms, like the generational terms, it was yes.

Speaker 2:          00:15:56       Today. Yeah. People had slaves yesterday and all the, when they still do some places now. I mean this is just start kind of like this that's going on all we were just talking about nail salons, something that we found out, it's, it's really disturbing is that, um, you know, there's like a diamond dozen nail salons in New York City or places like la where it's really cheap to get your toes and your fucking years painted and it was really good. But there's, there's all, there's this like there's a, wow, you're so, um, he would go and he was put together by the way. You are missing a button and I can see your belly button. Whoa. Hey, I want to have a problem with that. And again, I don't have a problem yet. No, but they were these nail salons, they bring in men and women, um, from, you know, Thailand, Vietnam and they're like indentured servants and then make them work and they don't pay them. And they, they live in these apartments with, with like 15 people sleeping in one room and like, it's all going to Shit Misha.

Speaker 1:          00:16:53       Hmm. Yeah. How do they fix that? It's a real good question. I think in this like what you can control for sure. First is in this country, you know, I mean things like, uh, what I, we talked about before the show about my friend Justin wren and all these, a little artifacts he brought back back from the Congo like that guys like changing things in like real time. But like in this country I think there's a bunch of things that could be done that are just not done. Sure. One of the major ones is they have to treat really poor neighborhoods. Not like a static reality that had, it just is what it is, is a really poor neighborhood. They have to put it like as a problem, like a wildfire. Like here you got a wildfire, what are you going to do? You can just kind of let it burn and just get out of the way.

Speaker 1:          00:17:37       Or are you going to put it out? You get the, you have a problem, you have a let the electricity's down, you have a, you know, whatever. Oh, a watermain broke. You have a PR, there's a problem. Yeah. But those have such direct, you know, maybe that's what's so difficult about, it's like put the put water on a fire, it's going to go out. This is like God, the implications on that stuff. It's so crazy. I think they should admit first and foremost that a horrible crime has been done in places like Baltimore when they, you know what this is, Michael would describe it as institutionalized racism and we talk about the zones where people live. It's hard to argue against that. So, and then you have to feel, then you have to think about like, what is the best way to uh, help people out of this? What's the best way to engineer like a, a more crime free, safer, more educated and aware and the more, and the people have these people feel like they belong as part of the rest of the city. Yeah. To do that without its collection efforts. I mean, yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:18:35       it's, it's something like, it's really, I'm really glad we're talking about this because I think like this, this kind of thing like keeps me up at night when I think about like, like fuck, what can, what can I do? What can we do? You know, you write a poem about it. We want to hear it. Listen Motherfucker, I had a poem right now, like I'm going to start, wait, but things like Joe, like your podcast are, are Balkan. Pat, you like your fucking dog. I'm serious though. Like this, this kind of thing is part of that collective effort is as giving people that first grain of thought of like, Oh wow, I never knew that there were zoning laws in Baltimore and inner cities that made it really hard for black people to get ahead in life that they had no scholarships. You know, Pete, the changes that need to be, that need to take place.

Speaker 2:          00:19:25       Like we don't have some kind of solution, you know like this think tank. But you have this platform where you can start talking about it and, and informing people. And you know, when I, when I get really worked up and, and, and think about like, what can we do? You know, we have this band that is growing and getting attention and you know, you have these opportunities to sit here and talk to somebody like you and people are listening and you know, you hope that that starts more another train of thought that can actually make some kind of different, I don't know what it is.

Speaker 1:          00:19:58       I think people are already having these conversations. And one of the things that they love about podcasts like this is because, you know, you go, yes, other people were thinking like this too. Like people are, people are wondering, how did we get to be grown adults with this chaotic system in place that was established by people who, you know, when you go back to the origins of civilization, even just in this country, which is at like a really recent country, those people are monsters. Those people are monsters. Oh man, the fucking hammer lumbers had done. Oh my God, we're monsters. Like, and this isn't, yeah, that's fucked up. I just read this book about, um, the first, uh, like the first interactions between the West or mainly or in Europe

Speaker 5:          00:20:48       and Japan. You know, when the journeys that these people would have to go through to trade to make contact with these countries. And I mean it's the way they looked at the world then was the way we look at the universe now it's just like, I don't know what's over there. I have no idea what's going on. There's things Johnny, there's icebergs jutting out of the water and monsters that eat people like in cannibals and shit. Like that was real, you know, so it's like this super, I think climate of defensiveness that we all add just as a person, you grow up kind of trying to defend yourself against the environment, high level. And then Mac Nellie's takes off, sorry, go ahead. There's just a layer of danger that at least where we are, you know, accustomed to. So you're going around the world being like, holy fuck. Like where am I? I don't want to get killed. 50% of my man just died. You like, you know it's, I don't know. I don't know what I'm trying to say other than the context is so different. You know it's, it's

Speaker 1:          00:21:39       totally different world. That's why it's insane to live our, to have our civilization run the way it's run now just because it's been done, done this way for a hundred plus 200 plus whatever years. Like if we wanted to start out today, how many people would think would accept the electoral college? How many people would accept the idea that you actually just elect a representative and that representative can actually like he can choose to vote against the wishes of the rest of the state. Like you can, you have like a electoral college and then you have a win. Each state has a certain amount of points that go in and you watch the, when you watched a v like that, like how many votes is what and what's going on, the numbers are in and what the fuck are you talking about? And then you find out that like, especially during like the George Bush days and they were still doing it with a piece of paper with a whole, and that piece of paper

Speaker 5:          00:22:29       that was, when was in that, like the 90s when the election was recalled because it was, there was, they

Speaker 1:          00:22:37       count well to this day people still believe Al Gore won. Yeah. There's a lot of people that believe he won and that they fucked him out of Florida. And it was also like how would we did some weird shit where they like they just crossed people's names out and ban them if they thought they were black and then they would have to prove that they weren't the person that that was a off the this list of like Fallons or you know like sometimes people, Jimmy White, there's a lot of fucking Jimmy wide span. You know, if you're, if you're Jimmy White and you live in Baltimore and there's a thousand of the Jimmy Whites and 20 of them had been to jail, like good luck getting registered to vote, they're going to put you on a fucking list. And then you have to go to court to like make sure that you can vote.

Speaker 1:          00:23:20       It takes too much time. They're not going to do it. No one's going to do it. Then all of the time for that and they know that they rigged it, which is just dark. Here's the thing, it's like an American, this system is flawed. I mean there's just no fucking two ways around it. I just don't think it needs to be here anymore. I think it's like one of those things like you need to write books on paper with ink. You need a quill and you just shit a no, you don't need a sieve. I Candela. You don't need to write with a feather. You can talk and your computer will dictate it were brand new world and this world of, it's hard to get information across to the states, so you need a representative. He need, you can't eat that. You want to make sure that every area, even the high population areas, they don't dominate the rural farm lands.

Speaker 1:          00:24:08       So we need to have some sort of system where people give a fuck about Iowa. I mean, that's really what it is. But that's that. That's the only place, because it was all established when people were apes, but we were raft riding a bus with no cars. Yeah. They didn't have phones that didn't know where the fuck you went when you went out of sight. If you went into the woods, if they thought you were a dream. People didn't even know if they ever really did know. They fucking really knew for sure that you were coming back. They make a painting of you think about that. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:24:42       Thanks. That was it. I remember the guy from the writing shit that's cool. On the cave was like an eight. It was like an eight track [inaudible] we were just in old town. We were just an old town San Diego yesterday after we played. We played in San Diego yesterday afternoon. And you go, God, I love it. Sounds pretty pretty. You know, it's pretty charming. But they had like, I, you know what, I was so hungry and I was like walking by in passing, but they had like costumes, um, like San Diego, San Diego, like settlers, you know. But they like looked like pirates and they were walking in the streets and um, people were freaking out. They were like, well, maybe there was a bus. There were like two big buses of tourists. I'm going crazy. Like I was, I was like, I was like, God dammit. Everybody calmed down.

Speaker 2:          00:25:30       Jesus, it's just a guy with a Cape on fucking slow your roll. But it was, um, it was funny. Well, just kind of piggybacking and what we're talking about because I'm thoroughly obsessed with, um, like frontier shows like deadwood. Oh, and I'm watching hell on wheels right now. I just got into this show how on wheels? It's on AMC and it's, it's really, it's really well written. I'm only in like season two, so I don't know what happened after this guy's like, I don't know if this is like blow the forest statement, but it's still going. So that says something bad about, it's, it's about, um, this, this railroad that's being built. Uh, the, and like, it's, it's incredible to be privy to that that day and age where like, it's so wild. It's so lawless. Everybody is just like barely staying alive. You're like, Indians are coming in killing you and slaughtering you.

Speaker 2:          00:26:23       You know, you're like taking over their shit. And it's really, for some reason it just cuts right to my soul. Like I can't, I can't not be just totally enamored and you know, enthralled by it and it like, it's, it's interesting to think about because that also wasn't that long ago. No, the, the, the frontier days when the country focus solely on this one thing together, you know, building this country, well maybe not together because there's so many immigrants in so many people that were like isolated and, but the point is that like, it's interesting to witness everyone fighting their battle, you know? But the, there's these great parts of the show when they all have to come together for a common purpose. Like there's robbers robbing the train that gets them their pay and if they don't get their pay, they're broke. You know? So there's like this interesting camaraderie and then their enemies and then you know, and that's kind of how it is in real life, you know, which is, which is interesting to think about because we're all so different and you know when you have these efforts, and I don't want to say common enemy because that sounds really negative, but like when you're all working towards something with your differences, that's when actual progress starts being made.

Speaker 3:          00:27:33       Right. That's, that's always a good scene in the movie, right? Yeah. To get seen as she can with the neighbors to fight the monsters. Mel Gibson. Yeah. How long exactly what watching Terminator Terminator two. Isn't that really why we get so angry and offended when people whine and bitch today? Because like you're like, good fucking Lord. You live in the best time ever. Society's going to shit. No, it's good to be humble role. It's fucking falling apart. Okay. Nunez and he values anymore. No one values culture or art. Will you please stop saying that everyone then we're just dealing with overwhelming numbers of people yelling in a room. That's what it is. It's not that there's not as much or way more interesting shit in that noise. It's just there's so many fucking people communicating now. Crazy. Yeah. It's the whole rule. The, the, the, the whole game is a different thing. Everyone talks now. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:28:35       Well, you know what's, you know what's super cool is like getting people outside of their comfort zone and watching how they deal with it in like a, a way that like, so like my folks live in Ohio, pretty Republican, you know, but they're really good people on there. They're fucking hilarious. And they came out to five shows in Colorado on this last tour that we had constant. It was, oh my God, it was so Joe, it was talking so close to smoking weed. Yeah. My Dad, my dad just retired. Just, it was just like a slow, a ginger backing out was there to help. It was, so my dad, my dad's got a super thick Cleveland acts and he's like, if I'm going to, if I'm going to smoke pot with my daughter and it's legal, I'm going to do it. And it's just like, what did, I didn't do it right.

Speaker 2:          00:29:16       And I was like, well, it ain't no weed. I mean, I was like, right, you look great. You gotta take it slow now what you're getting into, but I'll make sure it got like, that doesn't drown, but I want to tell you this fucking cool thing. Which was that like, you know, I love my parents so much and they're, they're really incredible people and I've watched them grow in this way that like they're always changing. And there they, even though they have like their beliefs and my dad is, has worked his fucking ass off his life, you know, and he, he's, uh, you know, middleclass business owner just retired. So he's got this, you know, this view on life. And then we, we put them in Colorado and he, they caravan for five shows in this. We had, we had lunch with this, um, with these incredible people, this, uh, this judge, this lawyer, and he's like, you know, kind of liberal Hippie, um, you know, politicians in Colorado.

Speaker 2:          00:30:07       And we, oh, we were sitting at a table with my parents and I was just, it was so cool to watch them interact with people that they would never hang out with and, and then watch them sort of like lay back and have like, just like absorb this information that's not something that they wouldn't, they would have on a regular basis. And so they, they left. And it was, it was such an interesting, like I really felt our relationship changed a little bit after that, you know, and just watching them let lose my dad really wanted to smoke weed, but it just never worked out. He did what he had to drive and that was responsible cause he would have been fucked up. Do you think like

Speaker 1:          00:30:40       gotten more successful and as you've gotten older, your dad can look at you not just as his daughter, but also as an adult human being where he respects your opinion?

Speaker 2:          00:30:49       Oh yeah. Yeah. No, we're, we're, we're very, um, we are like, no, we have a really incredible relationship.

Speaker 6:          00:30:56       What did she say? I said so, so we're not there yet. Well, a meal ticket. No, I would love to take care of nothing wrong with that. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:31:10       Beautiful. But, but I mean, you're a woman now and you're like a professional singer of a like of the utmost respect. Lay people live. Love Your Shit. So it's like you, she, he goes to see you and he sees her. He sees his daughter on stage wailing out these songs and people going nuts. You don't think that must make him think like, Whoa, I gotta I gotta appreciate like what it took to do that. I have to appreciate what's happening here. Like this isn't just my daughter. She doesn't just have to listen to me. She's not like, I'm not right about everything. I can't be right about everything cause I can't do that.

Speaker 2:          00:31:46       No, we, he's both my mom and my dad are really, uh, they, their support like is, is beyond anything I ever could have wanted. I mean they, they, uh, I moved to New York City when I was 16 because, um, I used to be a, I was a catalog model and I was doing really well and my parents were like, I was starting my junior year of high school and they were, I was really fucking driven. Like I had no inhibitions and I was like, I want to go here and I want to go here and do you guys think I can do that? And they were like, yeah. And they, and they let me move there when I was 16. Wow. And it was fucking crazy. And it honestly was one of those, I think kind of pivotal moments where it, it was their belief in the fact that I could do what I wanted cause they, they were like, I think you have something special, you know, which is like a really incredible feeling to have.

Speaker 3:          00:32:40       And they were always behind me and like, yeah, we fight. I mean my family is really close so we fight hard. There's a lot of yelling. I grew up with a lot of yelling, but

Speaker 4:          00:32:50       I know, I know a lot of fucking memory lane. Yeah. Oh my God. This is going to happen at some point. We'll talk all about you got a baby. Fuck him. Hello baby steps. Can we find another baby steps, baby steps, another word in there. You know what I'm saying though? He across like even though it was, it sounds like an inappropriate statement, but you know what I'm saying, the innocence like see, you know these

Speaker 3:          00:33:32       ray was, had, had to think quite ludes in the 70s.

Speaker 4:          00:33:36       Well that's a problem too, right? You start thinking like, I want to be that loser again.

Speaker 3:          00:33:42       You know, down a tunnel. I'm sure you also realize, hey, this does not, this isn't go with success. This doesn't help me, uh, get my shit together and not be psychologically terrified most of the day looking around for my next fix of Qualia foods. They were human though. Like my mind's smoke weed. My Dad used to smoke weed and like, Yo, we're going to Ben, we're going to do this.

Speaker 4:          00:34:10       I think there's a bad idea or it might be amazing. I mean, my dad's 94

Speaker 3:          00:34:16       four oh nine perfect. What are you holding back cancer? What are you worried about that? Well, my 94 is convince. Convincing man, maybe you're right. 94 is the home stretch. He might freak the fuck out. No, but he might not. He might like ease slowly into the great beyond two or three year old man to go from a pot to mushrooms. They say that mushroom six is significant reliever of the stress of worrying about the expectation. I'm so glad you just said it. I've never even thought about with him, you know? But he has anxiety. He's freaked out. He's been staring at the void dude for real. He's seen his body deteriorate. All these things happening and I get the anxiety from them. It's a real issue with people, man. You know, when we were kids and we would see what we would call and quotes the angry old man, you know, fucking kids. And we always thought like, God, it's got such a downer. Everybody has them. Every neighborhood has a guide. Poisoned the cats evil motherfucker. Yeah. He put a rat poison and killed a bunch of cows. Forgot his name. He's long gone though. Of course. Of course. Yeah. Every neighborhood has like old people that are angry and one of the things that they're angry at, it's like the vitality of their vessel is eroding before their eyes and you just get caught up in this shit. And

Speaker 1:          00:35:38       that's when you meet old people that hate young people. Yeah. You know, that was Elizabeth Bathory, I think it was. Is that what her name? I don't know. One of the most evil women of all time. She was a, a, a royal all imports is in New Orleans. There was a crazy long time ago. It was, no, it was in, it was in like, I want to say Hungary is Beth. Um, but she's like one of the most famous serial killers of all time. Oh Shit. And what she started doing after she started getting older, she started killing all these young women that were in the town and she would, uh, she would like bathe and their blood and she would, she would torture them. Yeah. It was in the 1500 hundreds in Hungary. 1516 Elizabeth Bathory. Oh. And she apparently is like attractive when she was younger and then as she got older, her appearance fading beauty, snow, White, Kinda [inaudible] away.

Speaker 1:          00:36:37       I mean, it's just, it's a scary fucking story because she was a royal, she was a, a very wealthy royal person, so she never, her punishment was just stay in your castle. Yeah, she killed a lot of people. Might've been like hundreds of women or something. Oh yeah, it was hundreds and they just, they just made her stay in her castle. That was it. That was the punishment. I think the, she like a special room that she had to stay in and our castle, I mean, so hot kind of jail I guess. But I mean, she still had her money. She still had servants. That's kind of how it is now. Just in a very different way. Like people that are on top can get away with so much like this fucking heavy. Have you seen the Robert Durst stuff on Hbo? I haven't seen it, but I know about it.

Speaker 1:          00:37:23       Gotten pretty far. One would say, and now he's kind of fucked himself and it's looking like hopefully fingers crossed. Um, you know, he'll, he's going to go to jail. He's in jail. He should be dead pretty soon. So apparently I was incorrect. She, at the end of her life, they put her in solitary confinement, so she wasn't a castle, but she was placed in solitary. She kept, she was kept bricked into a set of rooms with only small slits up, left open for ventilation and the passing of foods. She remained there for four years until her death. So she was psychotic anyway. And then they trapped. She was a voter in like a black room. She was a rich monster, which she was. She was a privileged, rich monster. And at the end she was such a monster when they found what she had done, that they found the bones of these hundreds of women and they knew that she had been doing it forever. And the servants knew when she bring girls in and they would be screaming and she would cut them up in front of everybody and tie him up and, and like feel tubs with their blood and the throw their bodies aside. And she had it. She did it for a long fucking famous woman in New Orleans is a house you can go to. And she was just, you know, member.

Speaker 4:          00:38:35       There's Times in American horror story, I don't know, but it's just like a famous story you want to go either. No, I don't. Not Interested in that. It's just so scary. It's so scary where people can get to a fan of a position of ultimate [inaudible]. They have a slave, they have a, you know, if they have a royalty, like if you've seen what's going on in Los Angeles with all these guys from the Middle East that keep doing crazy things and they're, they're getting arrested and they're claiming diplomatic immunity. Like that was the weapon bringing it back to the lethal weapon. Sorry. But that was like a big part of that movie was that Diplomatic Immune African guy. Oh yeah. Yeah. That's really neat. I didn't even see say 11. It was from other movie has been a bunch of them lately. One guy was uh, the uh, the two guys fled the country because they were racing through Beverly hills.

Speaker 4:          00:39:29       Oh, I did hear when they tried to claim diplomatic immunity and they just, it's scarred up my new specs. Qatari Kikuyu, a Tiara, whatever the fuck that is one of those strange pregnant, probably not, even if they hurt, they don't even use the English language. So like their letters are different than our letters. So we write something like really awful like QT a r I or something like that. It's our fuck up. They don't even use are like, why do we make it so you know? Why does it have to be such a weird fucking civilians? We got wrong. Say it like what does it sound like? Bitch was right it, it's so hard. Tell me, tell me what it sounds like. You need some new letters? We're fine. We're just got to stop talking to people that use phlegm.

Speaker 4:          00:40:23       I don't know. He's not listening to me sort of rant. That was back when people were actually terms. A lot of things, right? They had a lot of really beautiful things with them. They ate a lot of cheese. It was a big part of the Diet. There's a lot of phlegm in the air. Back then people were Super Fleming. It goes back to what we were talking about before. Human Voice. I could do some crazy shit. You can do some crazy shit with this. Have you seen there's a video of a girl who can sing two pitches at the same time. It's fucked up. What? Yeah, and she can move them in opposite direction. She can hold one, move another one. Like she's just using her body. I'll look it up. How is she? Well Jamie will do it and pull it up. Put Your headset on. There's a word for it. He'll find it. There's Tuvan throat singing in, in Mongolia where they're activating all of these overtones. Literally singing courts like shit, none of us do like tunnels, phonic overtone singing, but more than one. I'm trying guys do my best. So do you think that this is something that she was a born with this ability or all? We can all do it. We could do

Speaker 5:          00:41:34       it. We all have the equipment. It's like perfect pitch. You know about what perfect pitches? No. So it starts with pitches, the ability to just recognize frequencies as per the musical alphabet. So if I went like this and B flat, yeah, you would know, oh that's a g because I know the sound of that frequency and we are all born with this, but for the most part it's not really useful. So we just kind of phase it out. Right. Um, but some people develop it or for some weird kind of developmental reason, they hold on to it. Um, and if you're a musician, super can be super helpful. But this chick, she's just doing what we can all do, but she's just developed it. Let's hear it.

Speaker 7:          00:42:09       Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:42:09       The lady and the cat. Yes. Just kind of a bad too.

Speaker 8:          00:42:17       Or

Speaker 9:          00:42:20       30

Speaker 8:          00:42:28       or,

Speaker 4:          00:42:30       oh,

Speaker 8:          00:42:36       [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          00:42:40       it goes on for minutes with, she'll just eat control. She has this incredible, oh my gosh. Has an English accent. She was an obituary. Not English in my mind is perfect. Oh Wow.

Speaker 7:          00:43:07       Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:43:08       So is this something that she developed? Yeah. Do you think can do it? Joe? I believe in you. Believe in me. Interesting. Isn't it? Beautiful support takes us so far. Yeah. I just, that's, that's insane. Yeah. Have you heard Tuvan throat singing? No. It's a Mongolian. Thanks. Super Traditional. Here's the thing. No, right now it's a novelty because that doesn't sound as good as someone singing. Awesome. So it was kind of silly. If I can, I can sort of agree that was more like introductory. That would be like you like being like this is how you sweep the knee. I don't really know the terminology sweeped in Asia our friendship is on a different level, but at some point I really hope you can teach me the martial arts ways. Do you teach us can actually I was sure, yeah. We'll show you guys some stuff.

Speaker 4:          00:44:04       I don't have the time to spend kind of like really train you because he like lit. No. This is why I'm gonna say this because if you really want to learn martial arts, martial arts is not something that you're ever going to get good by dabbling. Sure. You're going to have to get obsessed with it and going to do it all the time and I don't have the time to teach you all others do what I'm saying. What I would is, what I would do is I would introduce you guys to some movement and some nice, great and I would show you what your body's possible of if you understood where to put it in like simple stuff. There's like simple stuff that you can do, especially Jujitsu. Jujitsu is the like one of the easiest ones for me to explain to someone because then I can explain to you in a way that I get my kids to do it.

Speaker 4:          00:44:47       Like my kids choke me all the time trying to teach, trying to teach my kids to them, trying to teach my kids to utilize their hips properly, throw their weight and do a kick. Like there's a snap your head. Yeah. It's amazing. I really way it totally is and I had a death. I didn't. You give me the poem faith. Well that isn't a way it's is it a way in the same way that we were talking about pool is is it in a way or we'll call it when it's nice when it's nice, when it's nice to look at like when someone's dancing. It's nice to do that. When I think about guitar, that's a huge reason why I want to take martial arts is because of how it would impact playing the guitar, playing an instrument, doing anything because all of a sudden your efficiency, your movement changes and you're capable of different stuff.

Speaker 4:          00:45:34       Yeah. I think everything is like that. I think. I think if you watch like a little kid's gymnastics class, um, I take my kids to gymnastics and I watched his little kids bounce around and uh, it's very interesting watching like someone nail something, you know, like there's these girls that are older, probably like a 12 or 13 or something along those lines. And they're like, just starting to figure out how to do back flips. And they're just starting to figure out how to land gracefully. And then there's girls that are even older than that, like maybe 16 and 17 that are just wicked and you're watching them flip through the air and you're like cheesy as fuck. And there's some young boys that do like these crazy ring exercises where they can stretch, the arms are straight and they're fucking, they bring their feet up above their head and they flip over and they do a handstand.

Speaker 4:          00:46:23       I mean, it's nuts, right? There's something about watching someone nail movement, you know, it's just like, it's inspiring. It's just like guitar, what someone's shredding. It's someone doing a drum solo and it impacts everything. So I play, I loved playing jumps and I have, I've put a lot when I was a kid, less now. But I have basically a narrowed my practice down to one thing, one thing. And I feel pretty fine about it, you know? I feel like with that one kind of concept, I can get where I want to go, which is have any of my limbs do what any of my other limbs can do. You know, my left hand can do it. My right foot has to be able to do it. My left foot can do it, vice versa. You know what I'm saying? You have to be on heart. It has to not make the that you want them. Nice. And when I was doing that, I started, I would notice myself, I'll sudden I'd be eating with my left hand. You know what I mean? I wouldn't even think about it. I started shooting basketballs and my left hand, I didn't even know. But yeah, dude, I was fucking, no, I mean I've missed the shot horribly. But you know, I think of drums can be as a person who doesn't know how to play any musical instruments. I think of drums, sculpture.

Speaker 1:          00:47:30       This is what I think I sing. I think when you're, when you're drumming, like when I watch it, like a heavy duty drum solo, I think half of what this guy has to do is get away from whatever restrictions his body has on his movements. Like half of what a drummer is doing, it's so physical. There's so much speed and coordination involved that half of what you're doing is heightening your ability to move in like the exact way you want it to move to create a certain sound. And a guy like me, I can't do it. You know, if I, if I brought them, I mean I could eventually, I'm sure learn how to play drums. What I'm saying, like if I brought someone into my world and made them do something that I do physically all the time, like an odd thing, like play pool or something like that. If they didn't know how to play pool, it'll be real awkward and goofy and the body wouldn't move. Right? But if they know, they know where the fucking stick is gone, I don't know how to do it. Like I see this, it's half of what he's doing is trying to cut down on the amount of resistance in his body, listening to his mind

Speaker 4:          00:48:37       to make the sound. It's the same thing with any instruments, violin or whatever. It's just on a micro level. You know what I mean? It's just more contained. And that's why I think martial arts, dude, once we do that, we'll fucking take over the world. Can you come on the road with us and we'll give you John my hard to do, but we could do more shows like we're doing new year's eve. [inaudible] bitch, if you guys want to go to that.

Speaker 1:          00:48:58       There was not many tickets left. I'll just tell you right now. It's not even a October. What is it? September 28th or something today. What is the 28th? Um, but it's, it's a crazy show. It's a honey honey. It's, um, Joey Diaz. Duncan Trussell, Ari Shaffir and me at the Wiltern in Los Angeles. New years ago, 2016 were ready. We were here for the end of the world. That didn't happen. I think maybe because of us.

Speaker 4:          00:49:24       Whoa show. I think the show with you mean Stan hope and Diaz had been, so you said this podcast and things, the universe said, kill. Let's give these dumb monkeys a chance. Pulled together. Pretty Dope. End of the Mayan calendar show, but it was so fun and we said how, Hey, we got to do more of those. We'd fucking never dead. We'd never done it, but we didn't for three years. Three years from the last one. It's been simmering that Marriner was going to be writing. You have no wine before it's time. Remember watching wells still stills commercials. I don't remember that. Yeah. See, you have to let her remember. No women before the fight. Rocky, the legs, the legs. Oh yeah. I saw that on Youtube in a movie theater back when there was no newspapers back when people were sending messages on pigeons and shit. They had smoke signals if something was wrong.

Speaker 1:          00:50:18       That's when I saw it. That's amazing.

Speaker 4:          00:50:21       Lots of change. What were you saying that you saw on Youtube? You were talking about something that you'd seen on Youtube. We'll watch Spalding gray, Spalding gray. So yeah, I saw that guy on television, actual television and I think he like he did movies. He did some short films too and like great. Yeah, I think he did like movies of his storytelling, but that's what they released. Jonathon Dami shot this Cambodia thing was the film. That's right. So He's in the movie theaters in my mind, for whatever reason it was on HBO or something like that. I guess that's not entirely correct. I think it actually was a movie theater. I'm trying to pull the sound of the cubes, the cubes, refill guys. I don't know. I think I do a lot of time for round two. We were talking about old people earlier and it's interesting because bringing it all back, alcohol, there's so many things.

Speaker 4:          00:51:12       Oh Joe, you never have to. But as a bartender shirts your bowels. It's the glass break. She'd get new eyes, he's got a solution. But that's good. Thank you. So many lessons. There are solutions out there. I think about old people a lot. When I get like you wake up and you have a stiff neck and you're like you're miserable and you're like crotchety cause your neck hurts or your shoulder or whatever from the van or whatever we're doing on tour and then I'm like this must be what it's like to be old. No, except like a hundred a hundred times worth a hundred times worse. Like you have ailments all day. You might not have pooped for four days and you need those. My mind is the balance thing. That's what my son, my dad has neuropathy. Does that mean she's losing the feeling in his feet? Let's before we get into that, is that the drink I was going to send him? Oh No, no. He's going to be going in. Okay. Yes. I'm going to ease up on this like cocaine for Ben and cocaine is like cocaine for me.

Speaker 4:          00:52:18       Can I tell you guys something funny while Ben Pours himself a drink, you want to choose there's black and drink crushing everybody. Okay. All totally game. Peer pressured but it's working. I know you and that Gal travel together. You gotta you gotta find a comfortable, but who do you think's driving? You're not kidding. Listen, we have time please. Plenty of places to eat around here. It's great to be here. Yeah, please. So recently back to my dad's health problems. People that are about to kick off into the next dimension. Did you hear about those fucking people that they were on that ghost hunter show a murder suicide. The husband killed the wife and killed himself apparently or allegedly in real life and real life ghost hunting. One of those ghost hunting reality shows and there was like a standoff. Apparently there had been like some physical violence, domestic violence issues, mature

Speaker 3:          00:53:26       them before working partnerships. And I think the girl was trying to, the woman was trying to get away from the guy allegedly, I really shouldn't talk about this cause my, my information, amount of information I had about the actual, the actual, you know, physical case that the murder suicide, it's very small but because I think they're still investigating it. Right. You know the story really, really, really recently, a couple of days ago. Yeah. Oh my God. Yeah. Terrifying. But I mean how crazy is that these people, you think about what a ghost hunter is at the end of the day, besides a bullshit artist, it goes under the end of the day. What it goes tenor is, is a historian of tragedy. Wow. Cause all, you're always involved in some story where there was a mass murderer. I don't not believe in ghosts. I don't believe in ghosts, but I don't not believe in ghosts.

Speaker 3:          00:54:15       But what the idea would it goes to is a ghost hunter is right. If you're a person who's going to a psych ward, okay. And you're, you're waiting in the basement for ghosts, you go into a place where people have been murdered. Well yeah, yeah. But you're, you're also constantly concentrating on murder. Constantly saying like for that and the tension involved in the expectation of a TV show. Dude, if I don't, you know, if it's not entertaining, we're going to lose her job. None of them were entertaining. So that's no problem. Non Entertaining shows. Here's every ghost a hundred show that's ever been night vision in the basement. What was that sound? Did you hear that? And he didn't cut to commercial. That's ever speaks every one of them. I don't know if we were speaking about frequencies earlier, but I think we were maybe the thing you thing, but there's a theory. This dude had that low frequency sound like crazy low below 40 hertz, which is just like the military experimented with like to dog. Sounds like with this is below that. Yeah. They were saying buildings that produce this kind of a frequency and machinery that does this. There's a correlation between haunted houses and these places because this kind of frequency can induce hallucination and people can induce really erratic behavior. It's crazy.

Speaker 3:          00:55:28       There's, there's the, what frequency did Hitler had readers like the forfeiture Ontarian what is it? Vegetarian. That was what Hitler was, right? Vegetarian. Sure. He was really, Oh yeah. Oh yeah. He's also an artist. Mommy issues. Poor guy. You feel like if he got to them early in life, you can prevent it a lot. I think you met him like when you guys were both 20 bro, we would've saved the angel of death. Like, you know what I feel differently about the things I was thinking about earlier. Maybe what you're going to do now. Oh good luck for Hitler. Right? If you love that Song, love that song. Hello. I love you guys. Cool to be friends with someone that you're friends with, fans of bizarre, you know, bizarre. You know, it's just, we thought about you a lot. Mushier and Montana. We were, we were in Montana for about two

Speaker 2:          00:56:24       weeks. Well, nationally. Yeah, I know. We were, it was so beautiful. But like, you know, wilderness is everywhere and everybody's like, you know, if you go up here you got to like be careful. Like we were in Wyoming, we were in Yellowstone and you know, we, we heard so many stories, so many bear stories and things that like really freaked me out because I mean, I don't have anything to defend myself. I would like to go into nature. You've got your width girl. Yeah. Well, you're right.

Speaker 1:          00:56:53       You're cautious about nature for the most part. The reality about animals for the vast majority of instances, the animals don't want to have anything to do with people. They want to get the fuck away from you. Well, that's not true.

Speaker 2:          00:57:05       But when we were in Yellowstone, so I heard all these stories about people like, you know, people get killed by grizzlies a few times a year, and we were in Yellowstone and literally a week later there was a hiker that got nabbed by Grizzly bear. You know, it just depends on, it's like just bad timing. And I never ever want to put myself in that position of that. I got go camping here. That's fine. You know, I'll go camping in Joshua tree

Speaker 1:          00:57:28       timing in a way. But it is also a lack of an understanding of the environment for the most part, with a lot of them. Sure. But although the one of the guys that got killed recently was a very experienced hiker, so man, I might have to take that back. You could fuck up and zig when you should've zagged. And the biggest, the biggest fear is running into a mother, to a mother. Bear with her cubs.

Speaker 2:          00:57:49       Like, I can, I can appreciate nature in a way that is, I, it's so fucking beautiful. And like, yeah, we drove through the park and it was incredible and, but like I don't feel like I need to sleep there and, and, and like I can walk along the river by the car and I feel fine and I know I might sound like a total fucking charge right now, but, but I really like what you thought of being torn apart by an animal is utterly terrifying. Intelligent

Speaker 1:          00:58:15       approach. Okay. Yeah, it is a beautiful thing. I think about being, I mean, they feel better ironman and experiencing kind of caution and fear too. You're like, holy fuck, I'm a little bit more connected now because yeah, I do actually have to be wary of something threatening to me as opposed to just unload. I swear when you're there, that's not what you're thinking about because the houses are so small and the reality of the beauty of it all, which is what the vast majority of the experience is beautiful. The vast, vast, vast, vast, vast majority. The, The Times that I've encountered bears in the wild. Claire's don't want to have nothing to do with people. They want to get the groceries and stuff. No, I have not. Some grizzlies stuff I'm talking about, those are the ones who you have to worry, but you just gotta be prepared.

Speaker 1:          00:58:59       If you bring guns, you know, you'll, you'll always have to be repaired. And you, we tried to shoot a grizzly and it'll still easy, but there's also a lot of noisy with the right kind of gun. You have to have more than one person and you have to be, you have to be ready in case at Hammons. But most of the time you don't shoot them. They shoot at the ground and you scare them off and they're like, fuck this. And they just get out of there and then they go about, you can enter into the natural on in most situations and get out without having to do anything where something dies where it didn't have to die. But there are occasions where like I knew a guy who, uh, went hunting in Alaska and uh, they got charged by Grizzly bear and wound up having to kill the grizzly bear.

Speaker 1:          00:59:41       The grizzly bear tried to get it there, kill it was a, it was actually a mother and they would, you know, they just didn't want to have anything to do with her, but she just decided she was going to make a rush at them. And I've seen it, I've seen it on video too. I've seen people, yeah, you're going out to kill something in the wilderness. You got to pick where you go. Honestly, that's what I'm talking about. Super Dangerous to go where grizzlies are. That's exactly what I'm talking about. The most scary places. Sure. National Park, they used to have that show on, um, I think, I don't want to, was discovery channel, whatever it was called, called the hunt, who was the one where the guy from Metallica, James Hetfield from Metallica is apparently a big time hunter. And he hunted, uh, like he's a hundred all over the world and he's a, or at least a bunch of different species, all these photos of him.

Speaker 1:          01:00:23       And He, uh, hosted this show where they were hunting for grizzly bears. It was like a really controversial show cause you don't really eat grizzly bears. I mean you can, but they do not, they're not endangered, but they're not doing great. You know, they're not like sort of flourishing. They know how many they should kill and they know how many they can kill. They like date, they have like this estimation that wildlife biologists puppy off man, take his pants up, fried Ben, he's taking his pants off. Risley's you're still here. But for the most part, they don't fuck with people. For the most part. They don't want have anything to do with you. For the most part, they'd rather get away. They don't want to get shot. They just want to stay away from people.

Speaker 2:          01:01:03       Well, so when we were up there, you know, you were like hanging with the locals and of course, like I'm up from those areas. So I have all these questions about what's it like out there in nature. You know, you live in, in Montana and you know, we, we met this guy who was just in, maybe he was being dramatic, but he was telling me all these horrifying stories where I'm like, why would anyone want to put themselves in that position? And I think it's a matter of, like you said, being fully aware of the environment, having that, that preparation, you know,

Speaker 1:          01:01:34       stories people tell honestly, like you're in that area. And then there's like a whole culture bear fear and things like that. Um, and at least in certain areas, but it's just like, that's what we talk about. We talk about how this one guy who got killed in Yellowstone, but it's like, it's, I don't think it's the kind of threat, I don't know why I'm reacting so strongly to it right now, but I feel like it's not the kind of threat that you smoke the cocaine, not the threat right now, right here. Yeah. Know when you living in Los Angeles, the hunger is a bear is not the threat, but you're smart to be aware that it is. It's on the table if you're out. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:02:07       Well Joe, I love nature. I love to fish. Fishing is one of my greatest passions when I have the time to do it. I fucking love it. I'm learning how to fly fish. It's really fun. And I have all these goals of these places I want to go to. They're places that scare me. Like I don't, I don't want to be fishing fly fishing for salmon and there's a grizzly bear across the river. Like that kind of thing is like, and that's fine. I respect that. I will stick with the area that I feel safe and because I don't have a rifle on me, I don't have Joe Rogan with his, his, you know, acute target practice, you know what I mean? So I think about this a lot because,

Speaker 3:          01:02:40       well, you wouldn't want me, first of all, you'd want someone who would be teaching me. It'd be fun, whatever. Like some of my friends that have been lucky to be friends with the take me to the woods, like Cameron Hanes or a Steve Or, no, the guy who was that. Oh awesome. That's great. I like that. Then that's like that's the best way you want to go fishing with me and just talks about that a bunch of times like we should do shows were take people for the first time that had never been hunting because it's such a bizarre experience. Even if you don't shoot anything, just being in the woods in Montana makes you go, oh my God. Like it makes you realize like, wow, life is very, it's very different than what we've accepted. We've accepted that life is cities and life is, you know, whole foods and life is, well, here's the thing, Nate.

Speaker 2:          01:03:29       Sure. If you want to talk about it, like going out to nature and nature is everywhere. Like we live in a city, but nature is, is everywhere. It's in the fucking middle of your sidewalk. You know, there are bird, there are crows, there are hawks. I mean there's just so many. Like it's everywhere. We live in the middle of it. Coyotes, mountain lions.

Speaker 3:          01:03:46       We also, it's like we don't see nature a lot. So I think sometimes we look at nature like an old girlfriend that we haven't called it a long time. We only have this like really elevated idea of who she was and then you get back with her and you realize this pitch doesn't give a fuck about me. It's like that because when you're on the top of a mountain and there's no cell phone service and there's animals creeping around and you're like, this is a fucking dangerous place to be standing still. Yeah. It doesn't care about you. Can I give a fuck? Yeah, it's beautiful. But I think

Speaker 2:          01:04:19       that you're, that girlfriend is here though. Like I think there's a, this sad misconception with the way that people treat quote unquote nature when they drive out to a national park as opposed to when they treat their urban setting, which is there is nature here and, but people don't think about the fact that they throw their trash out the window and there's ducks in the pond right next. You know all this stuff, like you're still in nature. Even if you're in a city, you just need to treat it that way.

Speaker 3:          01:04:44       Well, the idea that, you know, look at the city is not being natural. Spectrally sitting, not being natural itself. Of course, it's all the bizarre, the throwing of litter on the ground, like when people want and really open up their window and throw their garbage out the window on the highway. You're like, what? That I just throw a bag and then whenever we see that on the road, I just want to fucking punch him square in the throat. It's so bizarre how many people do it. Well, they'll open up a window and throw a bag out. Didn't happen. And you're like, what? Yeah, you just throw our garbage. A Wendy's bag. Yeah. Yeah. Like people are stupid or just like a little piece of paper, you know, like, like some fucking top of something. You know over the gum. You spit your gum out. The window is really bad.

Speaker 3:          01:05:28       Birds eat gum, they think it's like a, a piece of food and then they die. Fuck birds. Listen John, the way out there, there's so many fucking birds and this is why it's really important. If we get to talk to me, you can't take me seriously ever. It's super important. Cats, cats and you were like, cats are awful because they have the thing in there. They have the parasite. Why didn't say it that way? And then you have the cheese cats in the world them so much. They're sweeties. That's a cute cat cat's term called making muffins. You know when they need, they're so fucking you like that too needy. Yeah, I would say it's more like pizza dough. Okay. That works. They were worried when he called pizza dough, just looking for the reaction. Joey d is how the best bit about that. About doing coke with his cat.

Speaker 3:          01:06:30       And this cat was doing that Paul thing. It's hilarious. Betty, you should do about doing coke with his cat. What? I'm looking at one window. He's looking at the other one. Oh, so freaking out a lot of the time, like I think I kind of see that and we know what they're their nature's cleanup crew man. And the only reason you're alive because you're way bigger than them. That's it. If you're smaller than a cat, it would fucking eat you. You can't have, you could have a dog and a pet durable and you could teach that dog to not fuck that durable up. You could teach that jog. Hey Dude, listen to me man. The Jermel off the menu and the dog. Got It. Got It. Don't kill the [inaudible] really badly. You know. How do you think dogs are with cats? Like if dogs grow up with cats, they're totally cool with that. If they don't grow up with cats, they're fucking dangerous as shit around the kill cats all the time. Right? So they make these pretty insane cats. Cats won't make a pet rat and the cat in the house leave. Watch what happens.

Speaker 3:          01:07:38       It's going to be like Joe and you did the test with your cats. I want to know. I've never had a pet rat. I do know that cats other than like a few breeds of what? Click Super Fluffy Persians that get to that weird non aggressive state. They're just these weird, they're just branching cuddle. Yeah, the genetic aberrations. That's her fucking predators. The predators. It's amazing. Plus then you see these videos of like huge African lions in like these reserved areas of of Africa snuggling with the guys

Speaker 4:          01:08:16       that worked there on Youtube. It can happen in the lion damn fed well and they're taken care of well and their raise, well, it's very obvious that there's some guys that know how to make a friendship with a lion. You're starting to look, but it's not that much different than the idea of a wild dog. Like there was a few instances, like I think there was one where a couple was killed in Georgia. I want to say it was like a couple of years ago by wild dogs. There's a pack of wild dogs to kill these people cause people would let their dogs loose and the dog's just never came home. Or maybe they didn't feed him or, and they became feral or they were raised outside. I read about cutting out a woman in Canada singer. Yeah. Yes. She told us about that. Joe Did. She was killed about that.

Speaker 4:          01:09:06       Joe told you, but we stayed at a winery on Saturday night, actually Joe, it was a really sweet Rogan Fan. This, this fellow that was like, you guys need a place to stay after the show. And of course we do. You know, you gotta save money. Photos of you guys in naked online now. They probably were sleeping. We have never been naked. Everyone. We're never nudes. That's never needs. If you just operate like that, I don't talk. And you never say the wrong shit. Trust me. It's the way to go play it safe guys talking, always dressed. But we were, we all slept in this fucking RV and it was awesome. But they were, they were like coyotes and it was great. It was amazing. But you can hear it. They were right outside. It was so loud and they had this incredible like, you know, it's, it's funny, but I thought, I honestly makes feel good about that story.

Speaker 4:          01:10:06       But that singer that you told us about, about the girl that was hiking, we've got to pack on the road. We've got to pack. They're not going to fuck with us. I would, I would tackle coyotes for you, Ben. You wouldn't even have, I carry a Taser on me most times you left it in the car like in a really weird exposed place that it was one time days or laying on the fucking seat. Almost zap myself. You have to turn it on properly so you're fine. Maybe you left it on. I Dunno, I didn't. You can't be alone with, yeah, that's it.

Speaker 4:          01:10:36       You can be alone on the same team, but she's talking about the Taser thing. Sorry. Yeah. If you're alone, they're going to say, okay, there's a weakness here. We can exploit it. We're going to fucking dude. And the girl apparently was really small. She was like less than a hundred pounds and they were like, we could do this. You can just fucking do it. And they did. They did killed her. We watch a lot of planet earth in the, in the car and our travels and you know, there's no, it's tough. Do you think that the way that you think about that stuff has changed that you have kids? It's like, oh fuck. It's just accelerated. But it was always there. Oh. So

Speaker 1:          01:11:14       there was always bizarre to me how dangerous

Speaker 2:          01:11:17       natural world is and how it's right now, dangerously we fuck with it. You know, like we manipulate shit. Like I said, I'm from Ohio and there was, this is fucked up. Check this shit out. Okay. And the Cleveland Metro Parks where I'm from and where I, my, my family resides, there's obviously a deer population that's out of control, like a lot of places and people get sick of hitting them with their cars. So they thought it was a good idea to bring coyotes in to deplete the deer population, which they're not native to that area. So there, there's coyotes in Ohio now, which is so fucking weird. It's not natural. And like, you know, people start losing their dog and they, they had like, they don't think about those things. And I remember hearing a story of a, of, I don't know, I couldn't tell you, but who the, um, a good family friend of ours was telling the story that, uh, her young children were playing in the backyard as they always did. And she looked outside the window and she said there are two coyotes in there treeline. She ran outside and they're like, her little kids were just playing there, but people aren't used to that. You know? It's not like you have Montana and you know that there's bears there and you know that there's wolves. It's like this new introduction of, of people manipulating with nature and it's not not cool man. Okay,

Speaker 1:          01:12:29       well there was a lot of times people are trying to right wrongs like that's what they're trying to do with the wolf population trying to right the wrongs because they did poison wolves. They used to be more wolves. I'm not exactly sure if you, if you really want to be safe and you really want to have a city and civilization, I don't think you want a large population of wolves. I think it's probably super important if you want to keep this whole people thing going on at the level of going on now where we can get new Samsung phones every six months. These fucking wolves around like this shit is the whole reason why we invented cities in the first place and the city people forgot. Did you ever see that,

Speaker 2:          01:13:13       that video about how wolves changed the Yellowstone park? The the rivers? Yeah. Like they do serve a purpose.

Speaker 1:          01:13:21       Yeah, but the purpose is an odd one. The purpose is that of a Predator, like it's like this idea that the only one, that one thermal balance but not necessarily because you don't want lions in La. Okay. You just don't, but there are but there's not ones but no, but they're, they're cougars. They're smaller. There's more scared put six but a large line, like a 600 pound line. Like what if a few of them started living in La and we're like, hey, we have to do with it man. You know what of the eat skateboarders w we would have to like accept that. That's fine. You can eat the skateboarders. They're a natural part of nature. They have to, they actually eat too. We've been fucked that we would kill those lions. Okay. We would kill them all. Weed if they, if the line eight your friend. Okay. If you came home one day, mine was eating Ben, what kind of an attitude you think you'd have towards that line? He'd be very upset with him. Can we,

Speaker 4:          01:14:12       can we get a little more detail on the scenario because, well, this is what happened, but you know, we're just a flesh wound president that decided to, the only way for us to have total compassion is to open up the borders to all plants and animals. I'm just trying to fill a barrel with a proud extreme coyotes everywhere. You look killing kids. Too many kids. Fuck it. We have to be a part of the solution. I think there's a lot in predators. Take out people up to date. Are you on Terminator? We should end this podcast right now. That would be a perfect way to end it. I'm not at all. I've missed the boat. Come on. We can fill you in on one and three if you're interested. This is a new one. Which one is the new? Is it just blue ray? I didn't want one.

Speaker 4:          01:15:01       Just came out. Sign out yet. I live in a small five of them from game of Thrones and said Khaleesi oh wow. They're really pretty girl. The mother of dragons. Wow. Powerful. I'm not, I'm not, I'm not on speaking terms with the terminator, but the problem is I could go back and watch those movies. There's a lot of movies I need to watch. But what would really bothers me about the terminator movie in particular is that we might have like real terminators talking about dude, that that's why I wanted to bring up the top 50 years might be a real problem. People are talking about it. Talking about Musk, Bill Gates, did you hear about that? Stephen Hawking, they signed this letter to be like, we cannot have AI, but it's weird because they signed this letter. We can't have autonomous, uh, weaponry. Oh Jeez. And then, uh, but they're also, at least the Elon Musk is, but a bunch of these guys are investing in Ai.

Speaker 4:          01:16:06       So it's like drawing that line because they probably want to be ahead of it. But first of all, yeah, and if you are, if you're in the tech business, hedging their bets. But if you're in the business, like if you look at, I mean I'm just assuming that if you're a tech guy, like a part of what it is is about innovation at its highest form. Like what's innovation at its highest form other than artificial intelligence. It's like the highest form of innovation. Sure. The creating of a life of some sort of sentient being out of plastic and metal, three d printing. Like what's the same discussion as the three d printing stuff with this dude, Cody Wilson came out and was like, I'm going to print guns because, because it's someone's going to, yeah. You know what I mean? And then like, so you look at it and you say, well, it's something that we can't change if it's something we can't change and what does it to put our bunker? Oh God. Anyway, were tiring. Joe Joe's tells you and just some terrified. It's scary and maybe all I was so scared.

Speaker 4:          01:17:05       No something. I'm tired of hearing about it. I said scared. No, it's good of the society. We, we hang on a string all the time and it just, we keep, keep fixing that string. We're really good at keeping the string going. Well, we assumed that the string has to stay and we know that that's not really true and that's why we love movies about where the string breaks and the Mad Max. La Shit got crazy. Where's the water park? I know there's no law. There's no role. You have to fight to the death. I mean we, it's Barstow. You know, it's the worst. If you go to Barstow right now, it's fenced in in for 10 years it would be thunder dome. Yeah. I mean there's, there's swats we can manipulate and take off, cut them off to the rest of the world and they would be like that.

Speaker 4:          01:17:53       And there's places that are like that. Now we keep saying that and like, you know, go to Africa, we've got to go to Africa. John, but you went to Africa. I go this parts of Africa that probably crazier. Exactly this, there's a great vice piece on his place in Monrovia, in Liberia where it's just like, it's a total wasteland. People are shitting in the street, the governor or at some high political official came down at shout on the beach just to be like, I'm one of the people. And you know, like this is how we're doing it. That's what he did. Yeah, it's crazy. It votes was that before Ebola broke out

Speaker 2:          01:18:22       because it was like people that that was part of the like I didn't cause the phone. Well yeah, it's, it's, it's all the unsanitary conditions and stuff. People living in filth. That's part of it. I don't know. But, but you know, can I, I really feel fucking really strongly about this. Do we to talk just don't really feel strongly about, you know, we're talking about like hanging by a string and stuff like that and you know, all God, the government sucks and all this stuff and it's all, this is true. There's, there's, you know, you could click a button and just kill a lot of people, but at the end of the day, while we're here, um, there's some really beautiful things to experience, like your shows, comedy shows, and you make people feel good. And what about, why is the beautiful, I look, I'm talking, going down the list here.

Speaker 2:          01:19:11       Let me have my moment. And you know, there's all these incredible things and you know, some something that we get to see on the road. Like we'll have like our scheduled honey honey shows where you buy your tickets and then occasionally we'll have these really cool opportunities to play like um, a concert series that like small towns will have where they're not the most, they have no idea who we are, which is awesome because we'll go, we went to this town and Dylan Colorado where literally like I would say maybe 10% of the people were there to see us, but the rest of the people were there cause they lived in the town and they wanted to have their entertainment for the night. And so there was all these different people. They were like really young families and really old people and they all brought their lawn chairs and beers and we were in this outdoor amphitheater on this lake and there's, you know, I don't know, like five or 600 people there, something like that.

Speaker 2:          01:20:05       And end it like it was such a cool experience because there was this collective experience of all these people that came together for whatever they needed at the time that wasn't like, you know, it, it wasn't about us. We were offering what we could to the situation, but at the end of the day it was really beautiful because it was all these people that were having this experience together in their own way. And it was different races, demographics and, and like it was just, we had this moment and it was, it was really cool. And I think right now when the world is in this really funny place that's really scary and we can put energy into how scary it is and all that stuff, but we can also put energy into these, um, experiences together where we're trying to figure it out, you know, and like that. I think that's really important.

Speaker 3:          01:20:57       Yeah. I think most of what people are fighting over has nothing to do with most of the people. Yeah. You know, most of the people in the world, the, the, what do we want to do? We want to just hang out with their friends, go to dinner. Yeah. We don't want to take over the oil fields. Most of the people just want to have a good time. Most of the people, there are a few people who like really want to push that whole making money envelope to the point where we want to invade countries. That's 90% of what's wrong with us is it's not most of us, most of us. And I think this is what we're able to do now that we weren't able to do before. As most of us can talk to each other, we can, you know, like you, you can get whatever you message out, whatever your messages out in a way that you've never been able to do before. So if you want to do it in a song, do you want to do it with an ebook? You can, you can get your message out in this room. Don't tell anybody. It's a tolerance, a rap song that we love you Brownie points if you're white.

Speaker 3:          01:22:04       Right. But I think, I mean this is the best time ever. Like people that's, Oh, the world is falling apart. No, I don't damn it. I think it's always been fuck because it's filled with people like the world's always been fucked and win back. Guess what? People are fucked and we're the best things on earth. Okay? Turtles, goose island with it is dark turtles. You'd want to fucking kill yourself. It's about a week. If there was a million living beings on the side, the turtles one with these beings, noon with them, please, you shoot yourself right in the day. If I gave you till two bullets, one of them was for the turtle that you were going to kill to stay alive for the first day and the second one, are you going to put right in your fucking mouth? Damn. You're like, I'm not living with turtles for the rest of my life, not doing it. How do you put the turtle too is do you have Saracha? You just boil it. Just have to bang rocks together. The light up. Dry leaves. You got to get this. You don't have to cook it just

Speaker 4:          01:23:05       to make sure you kill the parasites. It tastes terrible. Thank God. That's a pretty awesome thing. That food tastes so good. If you, you know, you're talking about the context of things, how the world's changed. She didn't taste this good. Oh it's too good. A lot of the time. Can we get art form now? There's some art forms that are probably been around for a long time with food, right? Like cause a lot of dishes, like there's some, I mean we ethnic dishes. I started to do some work with farm aid, which has been really cool and learned a lot about, you know the whole fucking structure of you know, corporate food corporate literally like all the hormonal shit and you know, you, you're fine. I mean you've got your like Moose and bear in your freezer. Like your, your meat section is covered. Thank God you guys enjoyed it.

Speaker 4:          01:23:53       It's okay. But, but you know, they're the majority of the food that people eat in, in their grocery stores. You go to Safeway or you go to fucking Piggly wiggly. That shit is toxic and shit is awful. It is God fucking awful. I don't pin it will give you cancer. I don't think it's the show, honestly. Here's the thing about me, like it's just how often do you need and water. If you ate that every day your she would be fucked up. You'd be like, why do I have acne? All of a sudden you and free down not convince. I don't know because this is the only reason why I'm saying this. What does a shitty protein? Well it's, I don't know what it is or it isn't. See, I don't understand. I see that. I just want to be honest about it. I don't know.

Speaker 4:          01:24:36       Like what you actually get off of a piece of meat. It seems to me like logically I am attracted to like a darker, richer meat cause I feel like it'd be a healthier animal more logically essentially too. There's something biologically doing like no, this is bad. But then that's why it's counterintuitive because like a lot of their like really fatty cuts of meat are the ones that people enjoy the most. You're right. That's why they liked that. Why'd you, why'd you hire say it, I don't know. Japanese version of a beef with you talking about fatty versions of meat that have been processed to be the appeal? Like why would there, I guess it was because like fats, fats have always been super important because people, well it was hard to get food and they help you digest too. They do a lot of shit, but it also like you really wanted like the attraction to things that have a lot of calories.

Speaker 4:          01:25:25       That was one of the most important things where people were starving to death all the time. I have to get that fat, like fat was important and big was like keep it because like we gotta be big, but now you know, it's just, just shows you how these things change. Now bigger is kind of fucking is over. Well, you know, it's like over consumption, but people are just so big now too. Like there was a thing on TV the other day about a kid who was in a senior in high school. He's the biggest football player ever. Whoa. And he's a senior in high school. Like he's seven feet tall, 440 pounds holy. And he's 17 years old. She's incredible. It's insane. Like what? We're going to go right to the fucking moon. We're going to scrape the

Speaker 3:          01:26:04       moon with our heads that we're going to just keep getting bigger. That's the big, that's the function. People, they're gonna gonna run out of oxygen and start dying because they're going to pass through. They're going to get to a point a thousand years from now, we're, we're thousand. We'll keep them out more about that. That kid's diet and like what kind of supplements he's taking and stuff like that. What did he eat if it was some crazy lightning strike of like natural phenomenon, that would be incredible and I'm, I'm totally open to that, but there's so many things like, you know, like with processed meats, like girls are getting their periods at 11 today though. Yeah, I mean that shit be fucking guys standing there with a clipboard. Have you started to bleed yet?

Speaker 3:          01:26:49       Keep Margaret. Who is this? God is asking these fucking period questions. Be a guy. Better be a woman. I hope you have a woman doctor that's not a fucking creek. I hope it's not. Some creepy the first time arrested today? No, he got sentenced to, this is, this is terrible story. This guy got sentenced to only one year of house arrest and he pleaded guilty to fucking eight of his patients while they were under whole man. He only got a year of house arrest. That's horrifying. People feel thought he was going to get 20 years. They tell you his name and social security. You'll Google it, find him. It's awful. Oh, oh. I was getting, it's a twisted dude. Talk about an inappropriate story, but I'm Oh too late.

Speaker 3:          01:27:40       First Time I had like a gynecology thing, hollow like I was like 18 and it was a male doctor and he was so hot that I like did not know what to do with myself. I remember being like, wow, so while it's a scene in a porn, it really was incredible. I had my pelvis zapped with an electric needle by a beautiful dermatologist. God look at it and give you the thumbs up. That's when it would have been really weird about what the guy wasn't. I can't, I wasn't there. I can't accept while you are still in the building. She's going to go to the restroom. She might not want to talk about that. Trying to get out of it. She had to hold her to the fire. That's true. It's a vagina thing. That's considered for girls talking to a story about a vagina. You have to either comes or it doesn't come. You can't like go. Come on, tell it to us and they will love that. I think she'll love it. They get mad. What happened? Come on. Well this is kind of weird though. What's up with your Dick? What's up?

Speaker 3:          01:28:51       So you were having a big problem. That's the deal. The Dick or the Dick problems at pedals game. What kind of did problem talking about here? Phelan had a bandaid on my dick. Once vaginas are infinitely more sensitive to criticism. You know like you can make a joke about a dude having a stinky Dick. But if you make a joke on stage about a woman's mallow tourist vagina, sure you will be a terrible person. Did they want to have anything to do with you? Even if you're telling a true story. If you did tell us true story about a woman stinky vagina, you would have to like really word it. Well, you feel like it's a double standard. Yes, I do, but it's got to start doing it. You got to lead the charge. This is my thing. I don't think necessarily that all double standard double standards, uh, are there because of inequality.

Speaker 3:          01:29:46       I think some double standards are there because we want to quantify things instead of just looking at them as being completely different. Sure. He tell it, dude is a cat. Dick Stinks and it goes, all right, I'll wash it. But also wildlife, it's really gotta be serious if you're up close to it and yeah, it might be stinky as fuck. It's very possible. If you don't clean your Dick, it's very possible you dick could be stinky. Sure. The differences, penises, stinky decks versus Stinky vaginas that a man saying a woman's vagina, his stinky is like a terrible thing to do. It's like it's a, there is a double standard because it is different. It's, it's, it's a more powerful statement. Yes. Because if you tell a dude that is dicks thinks, he goes, all right, I don't wash my dick. Like that's it. And you know once you wash your Dick, it's clean. It's not going to continue to, I'm doing freak out about it. They'd be like, well what do you mean what's my only, those guys are paid. Most cats are just going to watch their decade woman. You're dealing with an internal flora issue, right? That's true. That's the issue of having any sort of a yeast infection. It's actually like you, it's lifeforms living in your cooter. That's way more sense. Team size affects the smell of your ges showed in thinking about that for the last hour.

Speaker 3:          01:31:16       Well, we know it affects the smell of your pee. Right? If you eat asparagus, you can smell your asparagus while you're peeing. I got to assume that makes it into your, your calm as well. Yeah. The only makes sense. I think lighter. You brought up the gynecologists locking eyes with each other. Just we went right to the toilet. Felt that too. We want to write into the toilet and started talking about stinky dicks. Not the direction I liked for us to lead. It is what it is. It is what it is. Live with it. It's a funny thing. But do you think that that's why it's funny. It's like it's, it's Ruder for some whatever biological reason. It's a router for man to mock a woman's stinky vagina in a cruel fashion. Do you think that security, I think that's like a degrading thing that you want to like, um, just sort of a d value.

Speaker 3:          01:32:14       A woman's may be national place, very possibly, but it's also equally negative on the other side. When a woman mocks a man for having a tiny Dick, Ooh, not the size of the dots. Like I swear by that lies, but if a guy has a microchip for guys, a little tiny deck, like there's these guys that have like micro objects like that. And if it's like full on, showed a tiny one, like a little one, I'm saying like, oh terror. Terrifyingly small little there. And if someone mocks that, he's really funny. Well that'll help. But it's less offensive to make fun of a stinky pussy than it is to make fun of that because I think a stinky pussy you can clean up. That's fine. That's fine. All you need is some as a dolphin. Listen, your life girl, some wild Kimchi. Need some raw foods.

Speaker 3:          01:33:12       Take care of your flora and my mom and dad never listened to this. Molly will, they've been listening. You know what's up? These chairs are fucking dope, dude. They're not bad. They're very good. Ergo depot, shout out to Earl depot. They sent him to us. I was skeptical at first because I had one before that was like super uncomfortable. It was like one of those knee ones where you go on your knees, you know what I'm talking about. You're in your, on your buttons, some sort of a weird way and you're going to tough to get used to, but they do make you keep good posture and then I got this other one that was like a saddle within this dude from Ergo depot hollered at me all he said, those are not good for long term. It's like you're sitting at a desk for a long period of time.

Speaker 3:          01:33:53       You need something like this. And he sent it to me and I was like, but it looks like a regular chair. And then you sit in it and you go, Oh shit. It's called a cup pisco. That's what's called you sit it and you go, Oh yeah, I've perfect fucking posture. All of these studies on your posture, your posture grenades, people are watching you and listening. Um, but, but like the way your body language expresses, like there's certain chemicals don't get crazy. There were studies like this, you know, there's this like power stance that's the Dick forward showing it's called the Dick for no when guys are all, so I go, I put my feet up on the desk and I go, Dick Forward. You kind of know like guitar to sound like a mood that's like a dick. It's like a horse stance. Oh, that's, is that true?

Speaker 3:          01:34:50       Why did I not know that he's being serious? She was serious. Yeah, I'm serious. It's serious now. So Tig, dig, dig straight down the river bend. Let me have this dream. Why don't we all just fucking sit back. But if you sound like board, especially if a guy has like maybe some sort of an alligator skin cowboy boots on and he puts his feet down on the ground in some sort of an office chair, you know what I'm saying? Some sort of a risky environment. Yeah. And then, uh, puts his hands behind his head, leans back and goes, well, how much do you like this job? Not May know Tom about to go dig for, hold on Y'all goals released from that physical position. Like you're fucking like, Shit's going on for you. Like you're getting more powerful by sitting like that. Like Thor's hammer, like Thor, they say that about smiles right there.

Speaker 3:          01:35:39       Like when you smile, it actually, it actually has an effect on your brain, gives you a certain amount of happiness. Now my problem with that, I think mean it's positive. It's great. Let's not sell our souls. So short. Yeah. Fake it till you mean it. Hello? Oh Shit. That's so beautiful to sing a song we went to eat. You wouldn't beat, wasn't even that good. Other than that? No. Definitely not. People at home, we're, I need this. Your paths have no emotions. Pretend you do grow. They'll grow water. Then with the tears of others. Here's honey, honey. What? They're fucking new hair. That was delicious. Yeah. This is a slam poem. It's even worse than a regular problem. Have you ever been to say it in a voice that's not mine? Always here and always on time. Top of the mountain. Bottom of the gully.

Speaker 3:          01:36:48       I been here before. My friend Sally Jeanette didn't have to ride strong immigrant background with a very good work ethic. You got to make some shit, Ryan, if you want to call it a poem. All right. You can't just say a bunch of shit. The lightning hits the thunder. I'm on the street. Why is he doesn't love me as much as he loves his new wife. As I get in my car and I wish my tire wasn't flat, but it is deal with it. I can't tell on me. My alarm wakes up. I wish my life was that interesting. Back to the grind and then I light my cigarette and everybody just captured that. You captured it. You let your cigarette in this one single tear and everyone was like, everyone has a bone in your acting days. I cry like a bitch, man. Oh, fucking cry. People get mad at me because

Speaker 1:          01:37:56       I cried so easy. But I just get it. I don't cry for sad things. It's a weird, I'm a weird person in that way for like powerful thing. That's fucking sad things. Sad things make me really sad. But um, I mean I can absolutely cry from them, but a lot of times like involuntary tears come from a really happy things. It does is a useful, I kind of was like, uh, like I'll be talking to somebody on the POC, like Rhonda Rousey when she was in here. I love talking to her about her, her dad and her dad committed suicide man and this chick that she was fighting in her last fight. Oh, I saw it said something that she interpreted as like, she might kill herself like her father. And you know whether or not that was exactly what that girl man, it didn't matter cause that's what Ronda saw and that's what she, and then she went out there and beat the shit out that girl.

Speaker 1:          01:38:42       And I was like, no fucking crazy. But it was, it was so, uh, it was, it was, it was so crazy. It was like this weird moment in history. There was like this w like I have this feeling for a minute that I was in this place that there's going to be a come a point in time. It didn't matter if the girl wasn't the right opponent for her. Like w it didn't matter where the girl was like a in her league, what it was was what had happened in this country with his chick had come overseas, just beat the fuck out of this girl on paper view. I know it's a girl and then like, so you have this crazy sport that everybody resists. Like, oh my God, it's barbaric. It's masculinity. It's most toxic load. The biggest star is a hot chick. The base star, the biggest stars sweat this.

Speaker 1:          01:39:28       The biggest star in the craziest, most violent sport the world has ever known is a beautiful woman who's highly skilled, who is a living Charlie's angels movie who flies to other continents to beat the fuck out of it. Just exactly about a girl job. But girl, who, if she decided to starve herself, she could easily be a model. Right? She's beautiful. Instead she chooses to get an a metal tube, a flight of South America. It'd beat the fuck out of some chick on paper view. And when you're there and you watch that happen and you watched this paradigm shifting moment, like for me, I was like, Whoa, did you cry? I almost did. Then I almost did when I was interviewing her and the tier leaked out a little bit when I had her on the show and I talked about it. Yeah. But I almost cried when I was talking to Connor Mcgregor. I was talking to Connor Mcgregor after he beat Chad Mendez. When I was talking to, I was talking about Ireland, Irish people in the audience. Then in

Speaker 2:          01:40:22       in, in Vancouver. You guys were in Vancouver while was happening? Uh, he fought, the guy was from Chad Mendez from California will. Yes. We, we literally, Joe, we watched that show from a sports bar. We didn't know who was coming to our show in Vancouver. And I said to Ben, I was like, I'll bet a bunch of people from this bar are coming to our show. And it was weird because it wasn't a market that we're really, um, you know, it's prevalent in, and I'm not even joking you, like 95% of the people that were at that show were rogue

Speaker 3:          01:40:54       Rogan fans and they ha they were watching that fight. So it was weird. Like I, I, you'd be amazed at how many parallels are, we all have these prejudices against people. Like people that would be into like MMA wouldn't be in the yolk, your kind of music, but you're totally wrong. We're all totally wrong. We're all scared. We're all like, you know, we were talking about earlier about like the natural world, we're all like terrified of all the dangers of like, you know, when people didn't have the internet and they didn't know who the people were that were coming in boats, we have less and less to fear. We're more and more like each other. And were we realized that more and more on a daily basis. So like when the mergings of our sort of fans is like perfect example that like universally the people that I introduced to you, I don't want to play guys up, but universally they love you.

Speaker 3:          01:41:44       I mean, you guys are awesome. It's not like I go, hey, these guys suck. But they're cool. They're fun to hang out with. If I tell you I love them, I like, I'm telling you these guys are, there's something going on. And if you're telling people that in your community, a lot of the time they're really open people too. You know what I mean? That's well that plays a big role. I think we could be, we thought, we all thought that we had issues with each other. We were all thought like that somehow or another you couldn't be athletic and also like books. No. When you want to talk to you about those books, he couldn't be in the documentaries but also be in the martial arts. You couldn't do that. You couldn't do that because you were either like a meathead or you were a nuanced person who wasn't worried about physical activities.

Speaker 3:          01:42:25       Like you couldn't be both like peop people. It's so, I love that you just said because like I play the fucking Banjo and violin and people think we're a country band, but we fucking rock like Ben plays the electric guitar. It gets crazy and like, but then we'll be sensitive. And is it fair to say that you guys are, because you're fair to say you guys are a Donny and Marie for 2015 and Cho, she's a little bit country. She's a little bit, hold on, let me write that down. That was a good fuck. Come see you could do is forced to them. At first there were the first fucking like, they were kind of like a hybrid band. They brother and sister though. Mormon. No, God, I'm so sorry dude. From desert noises and knock or his Roman. They are on the hook. Me Jamie, pull up the, the album of the Osman brothers. Um, there was an Osman brothers album where they did where they all showed their planets that they have. Yeah, yeah, yeah. When you die, if you're a serious fucking hardcore moment Mormon, you get your own planet. Whoa. Oh, that's what's up. We doing here. Why? One of their albums is like them and it shows like Mormon mythology on the album, like planets and shit.

Speaker 3:          01:43:52       How does it go? What that Jamie, it's a, you get a planet when you die. If I'm out of line, please. I need a five. If I paraphrased pretty sure the truth is coming. Cause I remember somebody showed me to me, it showed it to me and I almost blacked out cause I always like, is this real? I'm going to say something. I'm, you know what, I'm not embarrassed about what? I don't know. I couldn't name a song. Maria. Oh, they had a lot. And um, they were, they were, they had a lot of hits. They're very nice. But like Donnie especially, it's like a really nice guy. He's very friendly. He's like a super, super like Nice, easy going God that's awesome. Like when you're around him and you know like when I was a kid I used to watch the, the Donny and Marie show on TV.

Speaker 3:          01:44:32       So I like to meet him in like real life. I was like, is this real? Like I totally didn't see a real like, I mean Donny Osmond, I'm like, what is, cannot really be Donny Osmond. There's no way. I really hope after this we can, this is a plan with Louis Marie. This is, it's called the plan apparently. Which one from Seinfeld where we, we have some sort of an issue with our, but did they have like a huge radio hit? Yeah, they had, well the Donny and Marie had a big time show. They had a big television show. So it was more about the show. It was like a one night, a week variety show. If I had to remember like correctly dig deep into my memory banks, but they would have like singers on and they would sing. She would sing. I'm a little bit contrary and he would be like, whoa, totally.

Speaker 3:          01:45:31       Yeah. Like I would have this thing. We're kind of working together. That's it, dude. I think it's the plan and this is the inside of the album that has all sorts of like going home with that hand. Oh, the hand that holds the earth. Is that what it is? Yeah, that's the inside. Yeah. Hmm. Interesting. Is that the home? But whatever it is, that Mormon thing, whatever it is, and made them, Made Donny Osmond a very nice person. Very nice. I mean that's kind of the stereotype. I don't know if it matters. Don't know if it matters. I think in the end, being, being a Nice Guy, like Donny Osmond is more important than knowing exactly how stars are made.

Speaker 3:          01:46:19       Knowing how planets are formed in real life. It doesn't really apply to the real world because it's a super slow process and if you dwell on that, you don't have any time, there's no room. You can't fit that in there. A planetary question, can I ask you? Okay, so I'm reading this book. It's talking about all this gas, all this matters. Boom, colliding together and falling into orbit of the sun and becoming this planet that we're on. Right? So why is there heat? Why is there a ball of fucking fire in the middle of it? Where did super good question from no idea. Me Neither. I think it's like a fairy dust and Leprechaun. Calm, loving fairies and leprechauns each fuck a separate tray and a calm Christ the death. I'll take center of the Earth Texans to change a light bulb because that one has to watch the latter. We don't lead light bulbs would light candles around here. Well, I have to go old school ride horses, lot light candles, burning wax. We drank whiskey and we shoot and traders the dangerous it can be really self aware worked. This might be the most fucked up we've ever been. Equally fucked us. Last time I smoked weed and I was like,

Speaker 10:         01:47:42       Ooh, you

Speaker 3:          01:47:43       just flat line for like when you smoke me weed, it makes you introspective. Um, I, it makes me, I'm an introvert, a very introverted and uh, tired. Like, I don't know. I'm not, I'm not good at it, but also I'm not, but, but it makes me sleep, which is great because I have a really hard time sleeping, so I think that's something I have them just like chemical reaction to it. I've tried dude, I fuck you guys are so good at it. You, you shine, you really shine. Totally understand where you're coming from. You know who the fuck knows what it does. I mean, I know people that can't drink coffee. Interesting. If they have a cup of coffee, they feel like they're going to have a heart attack. It just can't do it. They just, for whatever reason, coffee's really weird. Like I'll, I'll, I'll have a cup and I will just like peek and then I'll cry.

Speaker 3:          01:48:35       Like if I, if I have too much, I'll crash and they get, they get really sad. But, but, but like for like the two hours, I'm just super productive like emails and shit. Everybody does that. Are you making fun of me? No, no, no, no. If I knew how to put you in a headlock, I would, but I think that's the one that you do like a karate chop. How do you protect the nose? Put the turn your the back of the hand towards the back of the head. No, the other way. His head. You're choking. Spin your hand like a left. Pinky down. Pinky down. Keep going. Keep going. Keep going. That make like karate. Chop your hand. Make me cry. Chop thing like you would cry. Chop like straight hand right now. That's what you're sneaking behind their neck and then you squeeze down on that. That's how you do it. I can fucking do this. The hand on the back of the neck, it goes into like a karate chop position like this and what that does is gives you maximum leverage. If you do get under someone's arm, you could totally choke a guy out asleep. Hundred percent. God. There's a lot of women, like if it came to the difference between like a woman who's like a kickboxer, a defending herself. It was the same amount of experience in the gym as a woman who's a Jujitsu black belt

Speaker 1:          01:49:48       defending herself. It would be on my, um, in my opinion, I would favor the woman like her ability to dominate a much larger opponent using only Jujitsu skills over, uh, especially for women I think. I think because Jiu Jitsu is the most technical and the most a positional and leverage based of all the martial arts and it's sorta like I attributed, I um, uh, compare it to like getting in an argument with someone who doesn't know English very well. I'll give you were having an argument with someone and they were like really shitty at English and then we're just slowly, you'd be like, what the fuck are you talking about, dummy? What'd you say? Spit it out. Stupid. Like it was a mean person. You know yourself, right? Well that's the same way with Jujitsu. Like if you knew that the language of you Jitsu so well and you had some dumb dude that was trying to grab you, you'd be like, yeah, fuck you.

Speaker 3:          01:50:43       They're like, you'd be like some crazy Ninja chick on his back choking him.

Speaker 1:          01:50:48       Absolutely feasible. Whereas like with striking, the real problem with that, a lot of women phases, the actual physical size of their bones, like when you're punching her, especially like unless you, you have your hands fully wrapped up like an, you know, a good boxing wrap and then a padded leather glove on top of that. It's hard to just punch people in the face if you're well, unless you have a good sturdy jilled. We're not like in a, I'm not like in a position where I'm going to have an actual battle with someone yet you don't really know. I don't know. You're right, but, but, but at the end you want to do it for competition. You want to do it for self defense defense. I mean like I would like to see, then you can't say that because that could happen on the way to the grocery store. Oh my God. You run into some crazy messed up chicks.

Speaker 3:          01:51:34       Do you get out? Literally there's, there's something, we're like, we're doing this. I wish I had the fucking man power. Literally to like we were in Nashville like two weeks ago for Americana Fest. We were playing this festival and we were driving under this bridge and there were these two guys beating the fuck out of each other in the middle of the street. It was like a bottle over the face. This one guy was choking the other guy who tank or no, no. Hey look, terrible. It was sloppy. It was sloppy. It was sloppy. Crackhead bullshit. It's one of the main puzzles but he was, it was like, obviously we called the police but like I, I had this moment where I was like, I wanted to do something. I'm like, what the fuck can I do? And I literally don't lean out the window and I went stop at stop.

Speaker 3:          01:52:19       I didn't know what to do and I called the police. But like if I were a new job, like I would have definitely stayed in my car. Right. Hundred percent to me. Listen to me, if you fucking have your driving by two people beating the fuck out of each other, you are not there. Okay. You, you were in a car. Just because it's right in front of you. That shit could be a hundred miles in less and less. There's someone in that mixture that needs you. Like if there's someone who's small and they're getting beaten up by someone big, then everything changes. But if it's too fucking dudes you buy, they're fighting this tree. So my point is don't always stock, just kiss already. Don't always stop. Sometimes you gotta let two dudes beat each of the day. It's better for everybody. Certain people, it's fine. Just give them both rocks and push them near the edge.

Speaker 3:          01:53:20       Go let them fall. Anything I do, I'm going to stay and keep coal mining. You got to keep moving. Okay. Genes need to flourish. They need to find better streams of of diversity. I appreciate the [inaudible]. That's what I'm saying, man, don't always stop fights, but some fights you have to stop. Right? Right. The classic is a man beating a woman, man. Being a woman. There's a small battle in the front row of the honey honey show the other day in Long Beach. I don't like that. I don't like that either, but I also think it's amazing people fucking look guys, guys, come on guys hug each other this summer that we're fucking hardcore, but also we're fucking lovers and like it was like, it was amazing to have these, these dudes were fighting and he was like, fuck you mother fucker. And I was like, guys, one of you as a honey honey tee shirt.

Speaker 3:          01:54:14       I just want to be like, let's think about this for a second. Here's her. I hate that expression pro tip. Whenever someone tells you that they're hardcore, they're never harder. That's 100% and like the expression, we're hardcore, but that never comes out of the mouth. But Joe just as hardcore, no, we'll never claim hardcore. I've never claimed hardcore. I don't say it. I'm more of like a medium core. I'm balanced. I'm all about longevity, balance, constant assessment of the path and don't try to run the furthest. Try to make sure you hit the least trees. Nice. That's how I look at it. I think it's like super. It's super important to evaluate the next few steps. Well, I think there's a lot of fucking continuing the same patterns. They've got people into the positions we're in now. A lot of flailing. That's a great word too.

Speaker 3:          01:55:21       Perfect for it. It sounds like what it looks like flailing. No, it's true. Right? Flailing. It's like one of the best words ever. Descriptively. That's a good one. You fucking spastic a Taylor. Damn, you got them right within us. I take them down core, bro. You're a flailing dude. You're flailing. You just running, flailing any crumble and they're like, you're right. I know. It's definitely a word that like forces you into a bad position, you know? Sure. It's there. I think that's how you, Oh, you've got your footing. It's like you're fucking falling out of control. Let me hold you. I think conversations, conversations are in a lot, a lot of ways to like numerical exchanges. Like you know, you say something that's 30 and she goes, oh this bitch wants to get crazy. And she says something that's 37 and then you might just rash here right up to 90 what in the 42 and 1670 but if we take away the cultural context of the words, she calls me and cut, my mother told me, don't ever leave her crawl. You will fucking cunt. But girl cause you can't you stab you stab her in front of your mother. It's fucking to the death tax. Conchas a big word but, but what are those things? What are those moments? Well those really take away the cultural contexts. There's a numerical value to, to the expression like the girl hit you with a 90 bomb.

Speaker 3:          01:56:54       Oh No, that bitch tried to cut to the bone. She tries to go through your own emotions to get into your fucking nervous system and start chiseling in their fucking the PD that they occasionally, but I think it's, that's what it is. If you look at it and not in terms of like a conversation between two people that are being mean to each other, like w w throw all that stuff away throughout all the, the, the, the cultural framework that we have. What are you watching? A number exchange. You're watching people play in a sound exchange to, you know, to keep, I keep trying to fucking get it to sound. It's a competition. It's a competition. There's that, there's a social competition involved and people being mean to each other. Oh, I really think that's what a lot when when people's like, you know, someone hits you with a 32 and you hit him with a fucking 40 you know, like Whoa, I walked away on a 40 you know, and I was going to fucking keep going.

Speaker 3:          01:57:50       But so a nice clean kill, there's a competition. You'll go back to the water cooler. You talk about it. This fucking guy comes up to me and he says, well one day maybe you'll be a manager to my pitch. You don't think I know your fucking dad owns the company or are you out of your mind? If you want to live in Milan, what are you talking about? That he'll shut the door, the lock, the fucking lunch room and they'll have these deep conversations. I told this mother Fucker, if your dad didn't on this company, you'd be buried under my house.

Speaker 3:          01:58:21       People do. So they go through them. But what are they doing? Their number exchanging. That's what they're doing. They're to just try to win some stupid social dominance. But then we, we're okay with it's all dynamic. Real what you, where we had a big fight like last week, took a long walk down, thought I was going to take the train to the next city and need me to travel with it. You know, do it. We'll go to Africa. Can I be honest with you about something? Um, this is fucking you guys following me around because I hate, you know, but it's, it's true. You know, it's something, the numbers game, I have a temper for sure. You know, and um, some triggers as to you, you know, but we all have tempers. It just takes different things. The main maintenance of this band that we're in requires a certain frequency.

Speaker 3:          01:59:24       You're fucking favorite word today. Um, that if we don't, if we don't, if we don't exist in that, there can be an imbalance and then it can build into this fight and then we'll fucking fight. Cause we're in a fucking band. But, but like, cause we were two people that spent so much time together and go through all these incredible experiences, but there's a certain finish each other's sandwiches. There's the stress that comes along with it. You know what I mean? Dude, you're traveling, you're doing shows or just live in whatever. But my relationship with the comedians that I work with is less intimate because we don't share us. We very, very, very, very rarely share a stage at the same time. And we don't have to practice together. And we, you know, it's, it's a totally different experience I think cause it's a, it's an, it's like you guys, if you have a bunch of friends that you consistently tour with, you know, that were nodding your band. Like it's very talk about numbers. I'm having the right combination of people in cause we're in a, we're in a a used Cadillac Escalade 2007 this is all good romance novels and there's room for about four people save for a girlfriend. Every once in a while our drummers girlfriend comes out or possibly are. I know she's great. She's very sweet. Joe. Joe, don't do that.

Speaker 3:          02:00:45       I'm sure you're a wonderful person. If you're listening, not talking about, oh, I couldn't possibly be talking about you. I don't know you. And they haven't said nothing wrong. Covered. You have this like combination of personal space and then she's trying to read my text. This is my side of the bus. You wouldn't even be here if you want honey, honey. She jokes. I'm just joking. No, but it's funny because like we fucking, we will fight and then we'll have these great experiences. Like where were you? Just you, you have to like work your, it's like we're all married. Everyone in the band. You know, it's like you spent so much time together to this point where like I know by the way that Ben Breathe

Speaker 1:          02:01:40       sometimes that like, oh he's, he's really fucking mad, or he needs a sandwich. Or like creating drama with your fake psychic

Speaker 6:          02:01:50       powers of psyche, psyche, please, please, please listen, please. You guys need more people to bounce off of. You need to get annoyed at me every now and then. Tell

Speaker 1:          02:02:06       him that fucking guy to just turn it off. Turn it off. No more jokes, no more fun. We have good dosing. You know what I mean? We see each other every couple of months. I honestly think it's lucky meatloaf every day when you're with the same person every day, like you want to meet new people and do, but you guys are achieving something that you couldn't achieve if you just in this like crazy life where you went one way and you do. You guys got this weird thing going on because you have this weird, you have this, you have this artistic synergy. I would say in that like you're both very different, but you, you were also very, you're, you're very cool to each other. Like as much as you guys get in fights, like when you guys are nice to each other, like I can see like when you guys interact that you're, you genuinely love each other and you genuinely friends.

Speaker 1:          02:02:51       And if you do say something a little mean every, occasionally you're genuinely sorry and you genuinely care and love about it. You love each other. So when you guys do, it comes out that comes out in your music. You guys aren't you, you're not day players on a fucking sitcoms pretended to be in love with each other. You know what I'm saying? I mean, you guys aren't like a fucking guys that studio musicians, they brought it, never met each other and they're going to lay down a track. Now you guys have been doing this and you have like this, this thing you're doing together. You know, this, this, this. You're all, you have to deal with the fact that you're so intimate with each other like you, you, you're going to annoy the fuck out of each other. You are each other. I mean you guys are fucked up.

Speaker 1:          02:03:33       You can totally numb with your lives. If it gets too crazy, you totally could, but right now you can't cause right now you're like almost one person. You guys are almost like one like really well spread out person. You just saved me so much money in therapy. I can't even tell you. I'm glad because I can't afford it. It's too good. It's still good together because you're too good together. It wouldn't work like that with other people. It's, it would be different. It would probably be equally awesome for both of you, but don't let it happen because what you guys have right now, you've hit this, whatever this thing is, you've got this ball of focus and experience and musical knowledge and love and it's all coming together with your own specific creativity and you guys are just in, you're putting out these songs that are like, Whoa, like they're not there. They keep getting better, like your, your shit keeps getting better. Like you have your old stuff was awesome and then you new stuff like grows and some of you putting layers on these things. So look, you got to be friends, do ecstasy every few months past the move and every like eight or nine months, just set a weekend aside where no one is going to touch their cell phone. Just do a little Molly. It sounds like you're joking, but honestly,

Speaker 2:          02:04:55       really beautiful things and, and it's, it's something that, uh, is nice to hear. Thank you for saying that. You know, it's a weird life. We live in jazz. It's fuck is a lot of instability and you know, but like we, it's funny like when we fight, when we go to our separate corners and if it lasts a while, like it's weird, there's like a real darkness, but it's weird. But it's also part of our dynamic, you know? And it's, I think that's part of all what you're saying. You know, you can't exclude certain parts of it. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:05:24       And if you guys had some sort of a specific relationship, like if you are brother and sister or be so many houses, same parents, those parents fostered and they created us and now we were children. And this is this our, this is my cousin, this is my cousin Ben. Yeah, here's a mom who's my brother, sister. And that's why we're friends, you know? But when your family with someone who you're not really family with, like I'm family with a lot of people and not all of them are related to me. I'm family with a giant group of people. You guys are clearly family. You guys are family. So whatever happens, like you have to, you have to hear, you're always going to have to deal with that. It's just not, it's not find, you know what I'm saying? Yeah. P. Dot. Husband and wife, you're not mother and son.

Speaker 1:          02:06:11       You know, it's, it's weird. You're not father and daughter. You're not brothers. What's the noise I need to make with my face? That means you got, and if you don't have that noise, oh, you guys aren't married. Well, how do you think he's ever going to come in? You know like those fucking, the people go through that kind of shit and relationships with like just what, what noise do I have to make the changes? Your perception of what this is cause what we have to, it has to be defined and then what the fuck? What's the definition of a band of really, really close friends? They make awesome music together. What does that, what does that, what does that do you guys to wizards? Wizards. Plague it. What the fuck are you, you travel all across the country together. Okay. What do I call you when I call you guys or you guys?

Speaker 1:          02:06:54       Accountants. Gandalf gains. Are you married? Is it a mister and missus? No. Is it a non gender specific designation of some sort of Congrat contractual agreement? Like what is it? What is it? Oh, we're just in the van together. We love each other. What the fuck is this like angel, man that came into our lives or something. I don't fucking know. And you guys to me, I remember when the first time I watched your video when you guys did that angel of Death Acoustic version on the roof. I was like Whoa. A while ago. We wouldn't know each other a long time. Now who's the dude's name? It was a crazy name that told me about it on the Internet. Balls of steel still. We don't know who that is. He knows superhero who has this knowledge. He's definitely love. I've had a few people, you know, it's one of the cooler things about being connected to people on social media.

Speaker 1:          02:07:46       They'll, they'll connect you with something that you probably never would have heard of before. It's amazing. And then just for you guys, we became friends, you know, in a strange way. So that's it. Yeah, it's been amazing, man. We are headed, coldly changed. Um, our band honestly, like it changed us from being a, we can throw the country now honestly, and it's, this has been a huge part of it. Huge. Wow. This is the way I look at like all podcasts. Honestly. It's like the idea of taking credit for the ocean when you accidentally stumbled upon an opening that turned something into a river. Like that's what, that's what I get. All everything that everybody extracts out of what they find on the Internet is essentially like you found a path, he hit a button, you pull the lever and a river open. You know, there's a ribbon, a river of honey honey songs or Sturgill Simpson or, or Tom Segora or Joey Diaz.

Speaker 1:          02:08:41       You're like some guys trying to take credit for the ocean because you figured out this, if you hit this switch, it opens it in the river, just runs into the villages and then everybody finds out about Duncan Trussell keep hitting these switches and like, so I can't take any credit for it. Oh, all I did was stumble upon some, some switching station for all these uh, like super talented people. Yeah. That's how I look at it. Yeah. But it's a cool thing that you're looking for switching stations. Not even though I think it's what's fucked up movie. Yes and no. You totally are

Speaker 2:          02:09:14       pretty pertinent purpose for where we're at right now. It's pretty cool and it's really great to witness the effort, the effects of what you do and at the switching station when we're out on the road and all these incredible, incredible fucking people that come out that like just love you and and really learn from the things that you say. You know

Speaker 1:          02:09:36       they love you guys too. So many had the flower honey honey shirt at one of my shows you the night the grandma flower. I have that tattooed. It's a duo. Shazamm you want me to dues? We're going to freeze frame that and jerk off. That's fucked. No time. Let's just move on how it works. No worries. You feel funny but kind of in a good way. No, I haven't decided to make a good connection with the nice people online. It's like one of the most promising like hints at what's possible for the future. Like there's this idea that because online is anonymous and anonymous means you're always going to be mean. That's not the case. Like you're always going to get a certain amount of people that are shitheads. But those people, quite honestly, almost all of them, they're damaged and hurt people who got fucked over in life and then they try to take out all that on all these other people.

Speaker 1:          02:10:28       I mean that's the vast majority of what's going on. But the amount of noise per capita is so high amongst cunts. It's hot so hard. Cause most people don't post anything. Most people would think you guys are awesome. We've listened to his podcast who've listened to your song. If they don't say a word about it, they don't tweet about it. They don't. They'll, they'll come up to me at shows and I'll just tell me, oh my God, thank you guys for introducing me to honey, honey. Oh, all the time. All the time. All the time. Awesome. They don't say, they don't ever say, you know, I tweet about them all the time. No, the people that are too sweet, they'll say like mean shit.

Speaker 2:          02:11:05       Well, you know, it's a free, it's funny when you talk about like damaged people and stuff like we, we have a song called bad people that like of that song. Thanks man. But you know, it, it, it came from this fascination with like, why are people so mean? Why are people doing shitty things? Like why do you bust a car window and steal somebody's shit? Why do you, why you should, why do you all that? That's one one way. But like, why, why you sinister? Why are you, where are you, you know, poisoning the cats in my neighborhood. Like there's this, this fascination with where that fucking comes from. Right. And we wrote that song and like, it, it was, it, it was just kinda hanging out for a while. It was really like thinking about it for a long time, you know, just, just why, how, when do you turn or you born that way? Did you, were you born into it like, because bad people come from Nice families all the time and, and incredible people come from fucking shit holes. You know, they crawl out of a hole, but I don't know if there's any one answer to it, but I, I, I just, all I can say is that there's a fascination with where it comes from. I don't know.

Speaker 1:          02:12:09       What do you think is more, more common? Do you think it's more common for really nice people to come out of total shit hole environments or for really nice families to have an asshole for a kid? I think that, yeah,

Speaker 2:          02:12:23       inspiration can hit someone at edit an incredible, um, like phenomenal rate when you just don't even expect it. I think, um, you can have information just like slammed upside your head in like an instant and it could be the littlest thing. And I don't know. I know that I'm privileged families there have, um, they, they have a, a comfort that, that unprivileged families don't have. Right. You know, and there's a, there's just a completely different perspective on need and hunger and emotional hunger. You could be emotionally starved in any scenario. You could be, you know what I mean?

Speaker 5:          02:13:06       Shape so much of who we are. You know, and you, you can have a bad experience in any context. It doesn't matter if you, um, you know, what's your, I don't know, your social statuses. You can solve a bad experience, you know, and it can still shape you and sure. What do we value? You know, we, I think in general we have pot, good values, things to be excited about. We value kindness and generosity and things like, so it's rare

Speaker 4:          02:13:33       to see someone, I don't know if I necessarily believe it that someone who comes out of a series of good experiences just boom, we'll do things unless there's serious psychological malfunctioning. It's like you're going to treat people as a reflection of your environment for sure. What I think, I think we also have this need to say it's this or it's that, you know, it's, it's a disease or it's a, it's its DNA or it's,

Speaker 2:          02:13:59       it's never that clear cut and dry. I think there could be a lot of factors and I think a lot of factors in your environment and especially your experience, they can kind of push your genes, they can push the chair person of getting genetically whatever it was. Those two things that weren't even taught to you. Like, you know, like your anger or your addiction or whatever. And you know, I think at the end of the day, like everybody's got their suitcase and we need to respect everybody suitcase because like, what might be a shitty day for me, it could be like the worst day for somebody or, or vice versa. You know, you never know what someone's volume level of their, their, you know, capacity for stuff isn't. And you've got to respect that, you know, like I'm like, Oh man, um, I, I don't want to get, but like I had a bad day with blah, blah, blah, and like, someone's like, Oh yeah, my father killed my sister, you know, like, you don't know. And that could be their first day. And I'm like, Oh man, I thought my day was bad. But at the end of the day, like everyone has a different volume of what they're capable of experiencing and if you're not capable of experiencing it, you'll die. You know? Like you're just like, you have as much as you can take and then if you can't take it, you're like, that's, that's what your tie, it's like,

Speaker 4:          02:15:12       what are you, you know, what are you, if you're not experiencing anything and if you're not dead, we just alone silent in a room. You'd like that lady that kill halls people. Then the left or on the castle, that was her suitcase. That was the suitcase she had to carry. Yeah. If you're not experiencing anything, you're barely alive though. That's one of the tricks of being a person. If you're not experiencing things, if you, if you're not having ups and downs, that's what you've got to go outside your comfort zone. Get Weird. You don't want to Austin, don't do that. Don't buy one of those shirts.

Speaker 4:          02:15:47       Keep Austin weird. Keep Portland Weird. Don't do it. I know, and it's not your fault. If you were about to buy it, go on this fucking shirt. Rule. I was going to buy. Yeah. If you've never seen it before and if you're really young and you have a head injury was just kidding about the head injury. These are chokes. If you're, if you're a young person, you don't know how ridiculous it is to have a shirt on. It says keep Austin Weird. Yeah, it's the same font and every shirt and it pretends it's hand written eight involved in a bad way. At one point it meant something really important. Not really because the people that were crying about Portland weird

Speaker 3:          02:16:30       were fake weird. All of them. Every one of them. They're all twats. The real weird people, they shut the fuck up and stay weird. They stay weird, you know, fucking protests. They don't want to get together and make a Facebook page. Keep Austin weird sign up here. If you agree, thumbs up or thumbs down. What's Joe? It's not. It's not. They're only here because of sister markets. See The hipster trap, there would be no hipsters if they had a forge for their own foods. None. Supermarkets. You think the hipster trap is a bear trap and in the middle in the middle is like a six pack of PBR. A pack of American Spirit Lights in like ray bans. Okay. They should do the same thing, but with Kale and alkalized water veganic make sure it speak on it and the goodwill cowboy. I love all those things.

Speaker 3:          02:17:20       Ps love me a good. I like thrift store cowboys, snap button shirt. Well I think the, the, the inclination behind being and hipsters good. It's like they want to be, they want to be above the stupid shit they see every day. That's moron. It can pedantic, is that the word? No. If you want to get down to brass tacks, I sure did. You know, I'm really trying to embrace my Midwestern roots and just fucking go with it. You know? It's just no my wrath tech I'm talking about, but you're totally, you're already covered it make me want to get Fargo on Netflix, first of all. I'm not that far west. It's more like, oh my God, go rounds. You know? It's just like, it's not as like don't share. No, it's not like more eastern. It's more of an eastern, more Rochester, a little less disgusting. A little more books. It's still that sexy. Let's call a spade a spade here, and if you can get them out of there, it become sexy. It's the willing to take a chance. Joe, you're so happy to teaching ballet. I got to get out of this fucking town. Actually. She's on the rock and roll tour bus. Ooh. Hanging out with the first black guy.

Speaker 3:          02:18:32       No, no. I brought, I brought us to sit down. I was like, wait, I'm lost. Listen, we just did three fucking hours of a single song and that's, that's not going to happen to you though. So what we're going to do, since you guys are, look, I know how you think. This is what we're going to do. This is no time for trials. We don't have to saying we could just talk me to do it. We're gonna. We're take a bathroom break. Exactly. See, and then we'll come back and we'll do a second podcast where we talk way less shit did we do okay? Awesome. We made a bunch of quarter to seven though, right? Yeah, we got about 20 minutes. We've got 20 minutes, but I think it'd be better if we did two different podcasts. I think it's cool.

Speaker 3:          02:19:19       We should definitely do that in both podcasts, especially the ones, but they get to see how good you guys are now. And the new video, let me keep talking about on the treadmill right now. You fuck. I've been running for two hours and 20 man, I don't to use talk. Oh, Joe Rogan make them saying shit. Okay, bad about this. This is all super positive. That's good. So we'll take a little pee break for a second. You were going to take a pee break and we're going to come back and we got to come back with a completely different podcasts in a totally mellow vibe. We're going to do is we're going to do what Americans in 2015 called hug it out. Ooh. Hugs. We total. And we're going to prepare for the next hour, the next hour.
