Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Doo doo, Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo, bom, Bom, Bom, Bom, Bom, Bom, Bom, Bom, Bom Bom. We're going to have are going to get back to that. Ladies. Gentlemen, the Joe Rogan experience podcast is brought to you by the fleshlight. If you go to Joe Rogan.net and click on the link for the flashlight and enter in the code name Rogan, you will get 15 percent off the number one sex toy for men with that sad college boy John Heffrons in the motherfucking house. Joe Diaz on the way. We're rolling. Hey everybody. What the fuck? What's going on? My Pal, my neighbor winner of last comic standing. The Great John Hef. Ron is in the house. UHM, if you don't know, has his own podcast now with another hilarious guy, John Reape, who also is a winner of last comic standing. So to last comic standing champions together on one podcast. What do you guys call it?

Speaker 2:          00:01:12       Oh, we're calling it the last podcasting, the last podcast on. Yeah, we configure it. The name like I, I didn't want to kind of have like a silly name.

Speaker 1:          00:01:19       Kevin Smith took the rubber off your, your stuff it back on. Yeah, he's real particular. It was really. I mean I think these things are good. The spit yields, you know, people like that pop and shit in their ear. But uh, Kevin Smith likes to hear it raw because, you know, Joe, so I'm sorry. So what do you call it? The end. What's the podcast? Last podcast? The last podcasting, the last one. Are you claiming this is it? No one asked.

Speaker 2:          00:01:41       That'd be good just because it's obviously playing on last comic standing. We didn't know if you want to call it where you get a clown horn behind it.

Speaker 1:          00:01:48       Is the last comic standing like such a big thing in your life that you would do that? It mean, is it like, is that like when you look back at your accomplishments as a comic, is that like the number one thing?

Speaker 2:          00:01:58       I don't think she'll personally, but yeah, it's one of those things you don't know where your path would have went. You like you. So if I didn't do the show, what I would just be just that headliner who makes nothing just with a couple of special things.

Speaker 1:          00:02:10       Kind of different than doing standup, isn't it? Because you're doing stand up and these little short bursts for an audience and you like trying to get them to vote for you. Did you find yourself like altering your material?

Speaker 2:          00:02:22       What? Because I'm long, not long winded, but my, my jokes are are long so I'll stick with the same subject. Didn't have jokes every couple of seconds. Right. So to do a four and a half, five minute set is really hard for me. Yeah. And I did on my feet and I did 12, five minute TV sets, not repeating stuff. So my brain doesn't click together. Small sets like that. So that was you that that must've been a difficult counts. Twelve I did five minute sets and other other sees a whole hour of almost. Yeah, cause every material I got challenged almost every episode. So you perform then the next show and for that don't understand why

Speaker 1:          00:03:00       that would be a big deal. Here's why it would be a big deal for a guy like John or a guy like me. We have similar writing style so that we we go into a bit and that bit will will squeeze every thought out of that bit and use it to transition to another bit and those segways are kind of difficult to do, but it's very important to make sure that the material flow seamlessly together. If there's a hiccup in the subjects, then the audience can pick up on it and it doesn't click with their brain as much, so it's really hard to do these little five minute sets and break them up because oftentimes one bit will lead into another bit and one bid by itself may only be like two minutes, but it causes a 10 minute bit because it's the catalyst for all this other stuff that comes after it, which you really just can't get away with in a five minute set

Speaker 2:          00:03:46       like that. It's real. And then if you're used to not memorize them but telling stories that way to go. So what's with Mcdonald's? I was in a car recently. I hate flood and do that. Your brain doesn't usually, it's harder for me to say no or, or remember perfectly a four and a half minutes at then. It would be for an hour and a half. So do you think like as it's so disjointed for me.

Speaker 1:          00:04:07       So do you think that that must have helped you to, as a comic? Just the challenge of doing that.

Speaker 2:          00:04:12       Why did I. So yeah. So it was all those sets and then the very literally the next day when I, when I was performing when you a bunch of theaters, I felt the need to write a new hour as fast as possible because people wouldn't want to hear what they just heard for nine weeks of Network television of course. So, but so out of the 15 years leading up to last comic, I wrote what I think was a funnier our. And I've gotten more out of that hour as far as development deals and pitching stuff to networks, uh, in probably two or three months just out of sheer fear of I need to come up with new material to survive or this is going to stop.

Speaker 1:          00:04:48       Louis ck just had a video that I found on the Internet. Somebody posted on the message board where he's talking about George Carlin and how George Carlin inspired him that after like 15 years he was doing the same act leg literally for 15 years. And then he was listening to Carla and talk about how he does comedy, how he does it, and he throws the whole hour away every year and starts with a new one. And you know, in the Louis thought it was so crazy. He was like crying in the car while it was listening to this because he was like, is it a moment where it's like, I fucking hate what I'm doing. I stand up. I said that, that challenge. Look how good he is now.

Speaker 2:          00:05:22       And it's funny. I think habits are definitely contagious. You hang out with certain people that do certain things, you'll do that. I just saw a Louis in San Francisco at a show and then I went to his midnight show and watched him and I left in the week after. I just saw, there's a couple of weeks ago onstage, I think I did 15 minutes of new stuff just because the ceiling was raised. You like you can go. I do really well. I crush it and then you see somebody who is working on a new hour and for my hair from the club. He went there Wednesday, figured out some stuff from my Sunday. They go in those days, his stuff became so tight because he can go home and he'd. Right. So it inspired me to go, right. I'm going to do that. I'm going to. I'm going to do the same thing and in some restructuring everything for that reason where you just get

Speaker 1:          00:06:08       board onstage. Yeah. Getting inspired by the comics is the greatest fucking thing ever. It's a humbling thing. You know, you see someone who's really killing it and it's like just how like a regular person watches stand up and they can't really quite believe that someone can do that. There's a lot of people that watch stand up and they can imagine themselves doing it well. That same feeling, you get kind of get that same feeling when you watch someone who's really great at it. When you want someone who's really great at you, like, oh, this mother fucker just hitting heights. Like you don't even want to know if you can do that. You know what I'm saying? Like you don't even. You don't even want to think about it. All you want to do is just get to work.

Speaker 2:          00:06:40       Yeah. It's Kinda like the one that guy ran the first four minute mile. Yeah. And then everybody else started falling. They're like, oh, there's a whole nother level.

Speaker 1:          00:06:48       Yeah, except you can't. You can think about running fast. You can't think about getting funnier. You know what I'm saying? You just have to work. You just have to work at it. But when you. When I say you can't think about getting funnier when you can, that's, that's wrong. I mean you can be unhappy and decide to improve, but that you can't be thinking about it while you're up there. I have to be funnier. I have to be funny. Or You just have to be in that fucking groove. You know what I mean? You can't be thinking like that's a thing that people don't understand. Like you can't think I'm going to try to be funny. You can't. Yeah, no, you're right here. Right.

Speaker 2:          00:07:21       And I always tell younger comics, the, the guys who hang out with like open mic, her's with notebooks at get at coffee houses. He kinda learned to write that way and they kind of stay at that weight. I tell young guys got an advice. Yeah. Every Friday night come here and watch somebody who's been doing it for 20 years and see what you don't like. See what you do like it. Start figuring out that way. You know what I mean? You know? Yeah. It's a, it's a tricky game, the standup comedy, but it, it, it for me in this last week, this happened after 23 years and how do I write a solid Louis got motivated in a sense of, okay, I'm going to start challenging myself there. Um, and then I decided to rework the entire act, like in this crazy. No one will know the system that I have, but yet it got me really, really excited.

Speaker 2:          00:08:12       You stand up. So this whole week when I was in Tampa, no one will know the system that you have. What do you mean? I won? I did know. It sounds like if you were watching, you would never know that this went down, but I want to construct my whole act as the hero's journey. Like in every movie you see about 10 minutes into the movie, something crazy happens to the character that spins them off in the movie while I'm trying to put my whole act together. We're at 10 minutes in I, I tell you I don't, I don't know if I got to make a decision, I might want to get divorced. And then suddenly the crowds like what? And then it's my journey and then the thing I got this huge master plan, it's how I've always done my act, but I'm really going to try to hit beats where suddenly you're going to have a romantic part in the middle of it to take no, but listening, you're just going to laugh. Can a romantic.

Speaker 1:          00:08:56       What is this Jim Carrey movie?

Speaker 3:          00:08:58       It's something called like Philip Morris. I Love Philip Morris and it was a Netflix film. I was like, wow. I like Jim Carrey and it here in Mcgregor. And then I'm like laying in bed last night after watching red state. And I watched it and I was like disgusted. There was parts where Jim Carrey was fucking guys from behind very violently and you, he has a shirt off, he's got to come in me. And I'm like, what? This is not a crushed ice. Ventura is now a fucking whatever. And so then it. Then there's a part where it Ian Mcgregor and he's got this horrible bleached hair and half of it's spent in jail where like there's just a bunch of gay sex going on in jail and then make it at the beginning of the movie they say it's like this all happened like this is a real story or something like that and it is the most craziness.

Speaker 3:          00:09:49       Craziness. Moving. Try to censor myself. It's the gay ass movie I've ever seen because I don't want to hurt his gay, but he's feelings. I don't want hurt. Retards feel you're not having sex with each other. It's pretty good. That was a joke. I'm just kidding. No, but it was best to be on a shirt. It was really. It was the weirdest thing. Seeing two guys just making out that you're like, like with like bag for comedy on mouth. Mouth to mouth. Like you're making out with the jet. I what the fuck are you doing greg? It was just making out with dudes. Yes. Tongue. Jim Carrey was just fucking stupid.

Speaker 1:          00:10:25       Were Gay and it was neat to see that as often. You know how like when most rated r movies, you never like see a girl's pussy, like they never left over and show you their pussy, but yet you'll see them naked. It's like, it's okay. I understand. I understand that this is going on. If there's a guy kissing another guy, I feel like you don't have to show me their tongue touching. I believe you. That's when you reach. You're going to the refrigerator to get some Bagel bites. Start Microwave and those look down for it. Yeah. Yeah. You want to freak me out, get good touch and tongues that I know our street. That's why it's so hard when you got a straight actor and another straight actor and you're making them make out. What kind of game is this?

Speaker 3:          00:11:07       The whole movie is based on dirty, Raunchy, gay sex, brokeback mountain. They were like, dude, we're going to go times to now we're just going to have Jim Carrey and a fucking jet. I just fucking everywhere. But Sex and sex. Was it a comedy or is it a like? Absolutely not funny. The whole time I was sitting in there, I'm asleep so my girlfriend wouldn't think I was gay watching this movie. Was it like, what? Is it supposed to be a funny huh? Is it supposed to be a comedy? Like tomatoes gave it a 71 percent. That's pretty God damn strong. They're all cock suckers. That rotten tomatoes. Damn. I need to see this. Actually, we don't know everybody. We know Roger Ebert loves man in a woman's sex. I need to see this

Speaker 1:          00:11:53       officer turned. Con Man who made the leap to white collar criminal after being sent to prison.

Speaker 3:          00:11:59       Don't need to see it, man. The whole movie. Jim doesn't say anything about crazy buttocks in here. The whole movie. Jim Carey's a looked so weird. I couldn't tell if he was wearing a wig or if he just had the creepiest hair ever. Like if he was in character like because it was kind of like forrest gump for gay people or something like that. Like he's like, I've been to prison. Decided to suck that guys Derek, you know, like he had like a. It was from Texas that it took place in Texas and it was like they all had that little time bubble shrimp, you know, but it, it, I don't remember what I was talking about tech. You were talking about bud sites and Jim Carrey and. But Jim Carrey looked really crazy like, like he had like this weird for La, like headline. I can't tell if it's really his hair's receding or he had like a weird dumb and dumber kind of haircut and it was creepy on top of already a creepy movie carries a good actor.

Speaker 1:          00:12:53       Yeah. It's a lot of people that don't give that guy credit. He can fucking freak you out. That, that cable guy thing. Remember when we played the cable guy? That was a weird role, man. He, he played that good. He can do some shit, man. I'm a big Jim Carey Fan. I know a lot of people. You know, there's something that people think about him being like real big and silly like ace Ventura, that somehow no, there's something wrong with that. Like it's pandering or it's low brow or whatever. I just think he's funny. I don't need to be intellectualized with my funding.

Speaker 3:          00:13:23       Imagine in sucking a dick. Watch this movie. Even has that hair to where it was down. Like kind of like reversing the dude. He was sucking Dick fucking guys in assets. He was like, not showing it obviously, but it was very good that did show him kissing. Oh, they shut them. Making up tons of respite sling between the guys levels.

Speaker 1:          00:13:41       I'd rather see a dude fucking the guy in the ass and kissing, kissing, kissing is disgusting regardless. Well, I know a dude with a heart on it was very confused as it is. You know, dealing with a heart on is basically just a sperm machine. You're just managing this fucking unstoppable sperm machine that's on autopilot. That's what a dude with a heart on this. So if you just woke up and you find your deck and a guy's ass like God dammit, now what to do. There's a big difference by kissing. That's like a thing. Do I go in first? So I kept my head. You're really thinking about guys, fuck guys in prison, but total kiss too much. You know, probably not.

Speaker 3:          00:14:22       They made it sound like they made it sound like the whole thing with the prison system was like, you could either get, you know, soap or you can get a sand to clean yourself and that shower, you get soap if you suck my Dick, you know, things like that. Like they made it seem like the prison system was all completely about sucking Dick. Like if you want your mail, you have to suck my dick and I, I just, I want to know if this is one a true story. I don't think it is or not, but, but to the guy, if I, I want to know

Speaker 1:          00:14:52       what the Jews movies I wouldn't to. I was too tired, was like 6:00 AM. I was too tired to like Google the guy's real name to see if it was a real story or not. I bet it is. I get the fuck happened at the Abbey and just look it up. Look it up. See if it's a real story. That's what I want to know. What the real story of just a guy hooking up with a real guy about scam artists that just love to suck. Dick screenwriters, Glen Feet, cholera and John. Sorry guys, if I said your name wrong, Benson, well these guys are. PSYCHOS was bad. Guy Goes, oh, I need to see this man. Hey, they're probably just sitting around like, let's see. Jim Carrey sucks Dick. Dude, I need to see this. I did not know that this was such a fabulous movie. Never.

Speaker 1:          00:15:37       Yeah. Would you imagine you're sitting going, oh, I'm going to write a script. You know what? Let's sit down and your first thought is Guy Sucking Dick. Oh, it was. It was be like, how could I do an action movie where guys, why not? Dude, listen, if you only make a really good movie about Guy Sucking Dick, good for you, man. Maybe this movie, this is Brian disagrees on a lot of movies. Maybe this is an amazing human because look is 71 percent on rotten tomatoes and tomato 71. I think the biggest thing was saying good, Jim Carrey doing mcgregor tears like big. Here's the big tests. Ready, here's the big tests. Okay. I say I trust rotten tomatoes. I say rotten tomatoes generally represents how I feel about movies. Pretty accurate. So let's type in boondock saints and this will discuss this. This will be it for me. Type type in red state. Oh, I wrote boondock saints.

Speaker 1:          00:16:39       John, have you seen this Jim Carrey movie? No, I have not. Will you watch it? Not, not after that. I just know I'd rather see a 17 percent. Okay. Yeah. Look rotten tomatoes is on point. Rotten tomatoes is on point. All right. Type in [inaudible] 71 then that moves in red states. Don't do it yet, but you'd love to read it. And that was like the best movie ever. I haven't seen. I don't know what it is. Forty percent. That's. No, I really liked that movie. I thought it was way better than that, but I've talked to people in line. I didn't like it, man. Rotten tomatoes is not accurate. One hundred percent. I think it is and I think Phillip Morris might be the best but fucking movie in the history of the movies. I think I got to go with that. I wish rotten tomatoes was just tuned into what you like, you know, you could say, what's giving your favorite movies?

Speaker 1:          00:17:28       Maybe there's a program like that you can say, give me your favorite movies. What? What music do you listen to? You married, single, divorced. How old you are you healthy? Do you exercise? Throw that shown that you're sleepy every time you want to watch a movie, tell me what's good out there, man. Do you go to cheesecake before the movie and get the full? Do you do that problem is that you'll never expand. You'll never become someone other than who you are. They'll just keep giving you the same influences. Their genius. They kind of do that with music. They don't dope and a lot of times it's pretty. You Go, yeah, I would have put together this playlist. I just got appletv Oh yeah, I've had it. I've had it for years. Fucking awesome. Beautiful. No. Have you done that

Speaker 3:          00:18:10       thing where you've, uh, you've filmed video with your phone and then just push a button and it

Speaker 1:          00:18:15       click it. Yeah. That's incredible. That's incredible. That the, uh, the, the ability to play songs from your phone, one of you guys podcast on [inaudible], there's a podcast thing popped up and just hit play. The most amazing thing is I went to documentaries just so I'm thinking, you know what, what do they got? They got fucking page after page after page of all the best document to watch. I got red state, I rendered red state. Do they have everything? The corporation they have like pretty much every documentary of mainstream documentary I've ever seen is on this apple thing. I watched the man on the night and dungeons and dragons. I mean there's a lot of your, there's a lot of obscure documentaries that don't make it to there I'm sure, but they had driven the Jens pulver documentary, which is pretty obscure even in the world of mixed martial arts. I don't know a lot of people who know about it, you know.

Speaker 3:          00:19:08       No. You have your vimeo channel on there now. I just sit there and watch all the fucking podcast that we do at death squad from on my apple TV. That's the whole thing on there. And, and the, the only thing I liked about Roku that was better, which was the exact, it's the exact same thing. Pretty much ones. Apple.

Speaker 1:          00:19:24       When did you say you have the, your death squad podcasts on Vimeo. How do you have

Speaker 3:          00:19:29       just upload them onto a vimeo? Every time we do one,

Speaker 1:          00:19:33       we should do that with them. This to. Yeah. Why don't we do that with us? I don't know. Okay. Let's do that with this mother fucker. But you had more of a statement than a hey, what do you think we should? Yeah, why wouldn't you do that with this side?

Speaker 3:          00:19:48       Uh, well the business stuff or I'll tell you later. Oh, business stuff. Uh, okay. If you want to talk about it on air weekend, it might be, it might be tricky. Uh, yeah. So anyways, um, but you know, episodes on your, you can watch the death squad and listen to it. I'm just watching the VIMEO channel. You watch it and listen to it. It's, you know, you're just laying in bed. And so you're filming your stuff on Vimeo as well as putting it on ustream? No, I'm just taking my seat. What happens is you use stirring for me, uh, crashes all the time because I have ads and commercials where you got privileged to get all that taken away. Uh, for my watchers, they hate using this service, which is understandable. It's some of them,

Speaker 1:          00:20:31       some of this stuff. A lot of people complain about those ads, so I stopped the whole screen. You miss a chunk of the podcast,

Speaker 3:          00:20:37       right? So I took all my stuff after it's broadcast live, I take it off your stream and put it on Vimeo just because I have a pro account. I never used vimeo and now that apple TV started vimeo on the apple tv, I was like, you know what, I'm moving everything to vimeo now because Vimeo, my youtube accounts always get canceled. They always get busted. Like I had a director account, which I don't know you when you first signed up for Youtube back in the day view made longer videos that were like over 10 minutes, which is what the limit was at that time. You could apply for a thing called a director account, which gave you access to put movies on there, like Youtube was trying to reach out to small independent directors. I got that account. They stopped that a year later and now the only. You have like 15 minute limits on youtube. Nobody has any longer and Listeria company. How come I see that though sometimes because all the director accounts got grandfathered.

Speaker 1:          00:21:30       Oh Wow. So Youtube recently took my director account away so I can't do that on youtube anymore. Yeah. We used to be able to upload longer shit and I remember I tried to upload one of the podcasts video blogs that we do on Vimeo. We have 10 of them up there and what we do is after we have an interview, we sit down and we videotape like, oh that was fun. We'd shoot the shit for a little bit and get to just whatever. It's just something else to do. Just fine, you know. So we started putting those up on Vimeo, but they're like way better quality than Youtube and they let you put like 15, 20 minutes. I don't give a fuck, you know, like do it as long as you want. Youtube is like smaller and shittier quality. I guess some. Some of the youtubes or a nice hd now too. Right, right, right. Yeah, but that's why I use vimeo just looks better, doesn't it?

Speaker 3:          00:22:22       Well, vimeo actually from testing used to be eight. Youtube does a great job, but their hd stuff, if you do it right and you follow the right code x, they're perfect and they're in more devices. Smartphones, they actually have it down. Pat. Vimeo is kind of cool. It's a smaller company. I wouldn't say. I think they're up to par now that, but for awhile I thought Youtube hd was actually a lot better,

Speaker 1:          00:22:42       but our shit looks better on Vimeo than it looks on Youtube.

Speaker 3:          00:22:47       Well, you might see the. One of the things that youtube is, when you're watching a video on youtube, it always defaults to like a lot of times it defaults to the lowest resolution and so if the research, like vimeo always put you in hd when you're on their page, so a lot of times that's what it is. It's just a simple thing like that,

Speaker 1:          00:23:03       oh fuck you. Youtube. Well, youtube has a lot more users. They're definitely trying to save bandwidth settings. There is settings in your youtube account that makes it so it's always playing hd and always the best, but it's not defaulted to that. Speaking of Youtube, did you see that video that they just put out of the chimps that were locked up? They never saw sunlight for 30 years. They want to believe they were stolen from their mothers at birth and taken to Austria and they were used, uh, in the labs where they were shot up with hepatitis and HIV and then they released them from this. And then the, uh, the, they let these chimps outside for like the first time ever. It was crazy to see. And if you see that, you still think people should be experimented on champs. You're a sick fuck. Those fucking things.

Speaker 1:          00:23:50       Getting think man. Those things can think and they feel and they have emotions. They're smart. And when they got outside and they started seeing the sun, they started jumping up and hugging each other, making each other and looking out and trying to figure out how to. How to walk on the grass and touching things and hugging each other and laughing. That is. That is the craziest thing that we justify is taking intelligent animals and holding them captive. Whether it's dolphins or chimps. That is a fucking weird thing, man. I mean that is like slavery. It might as well be slavery. If you know how smart champions locking them up like that, you, you might. It might as well be slavery. Imprisoning them, stealing them from their mothers. Like, whoa man, that's, that's pretty fucking rough. You're causing some serious pain. So real emotional pain. And these poor animals.

Speaker 1:          00:24:42       Smart fucking animals too. Because it's a weird video, man. It's really creepy. It makes you feel bad to be a person. It makes you feel bad at someone's doing stuff like that. You know? I know there's a lot of people out there. Fuck you, man. If it wasn't for those really, are you sure? Yeah. Vaccines are awesome. Don't get me wrong, it is awesome that they figured out a way to cure a lot of diseases. You're absolutely right, but at what cost that cost? Is that the only way to do it? I'm down with you doing shit to a rabbit. You want to fuck with a rabbit. It doesn't really bother me, but when they can think, when they're smart. I know rabbits get scared. It sucks to be them, but they're fucking rabbits. All right. The new people don't want to hierarch animals, but there's a reason why some animals just sit around and eat and shit and that's it, and then there's other ones that are way stronger than eat those motherfuckers.

Speaker 1:          00:25:32       That's why those motherfuckers are there. Their food, they might not know it. You know? They think they're just grass eaters. They all serve a little piece, a little piece in the pie, but chimps, chimps are so close to us to lock them up like that and see them come out of this thing. It was really heartbreaking. It was really confusing. You know? It's like, wow, this. This doesn't seem to be something that we should be doing in 2011. It doesn't seem like we should be doing any studies on chimps at this stage. It's like we know enough about human beings. We know enough about feelings and emotions. We know enough about how close they are to us and yet we're still willing to do this. That's fucked up. I'd be better. I'd be happier if they were doing it to murderers happier if they were doing the shitheads rapists.

Speaker 1:          00:26:14       You know what I'm saying? There's a lot of confirmed out there. Some confirmed jailed up cons. Have you learned through experiments for real? Why don't we do it on them? I mean, people go, you can't do them to voluntary. I know, but you know what? So is rape and murder. If someone's acutely, if someone is guilty of rape and murder, then the question is how do you know for sure that they're guilty? They didn't just get fucked by the system because they have no money and they couldn't afford a good lawyer, but that are that go. No, I. I killed all 12 of them. They were sleeping in their beds. Yeah. Came through the window and I killed them off the articles. Yeah. Yeah. Fucking experiment on them. Leave those chimps. Chimps never did shit to nobody. You don't have to steal them from their mother's little baby champs and final white discount on them and ship.

Speaker 1:          00:26:57       But why don't we? Why? Why can we? Because people are pussies. That's why we're going to kill them. You should like that week ahead of time, she'd be all exterior Jason Bourne and look how that worked out. Well, I was a member of the Ted nugent message board. I tell you that. What the fuck the problem is the God damn liberals, but they're right. I mean there's the liberals is the idea of constant compassion and the need to to treat all human beings is absolutely equal despite their past and what they've done. Listen man, if you're some fucking religious person who's completely recanted from your horrible life and it seems that you've done, you know, like as much as possible to, to make up for your shitty actions in the past, there's people that have made mistakes and they've turned their life around. I completely, totally believe that.

Speaker 1:          00:27:42       But then there's also cons. Yeah. You know, it's, it's up to us to figure out who they are and just experiment on them. Man. You're on your fourth trip to Aruba. Coming back by yourself even though you and your girlfriend went, yeah, you should get hooked up to your net. Why does it always happen in a room? But I know. I know. What is it? Is it people saying no? Is it girls turning guys down and the guys being mad? Is it someone getting jealous? Is it just cycled? Last one was a guy who met a girl online fluor to. They're on vacation. His girlfriend. His most recent missing. Yeah. Yeah. That I, I think he might've said that she's probably dead now for that guy. He said she's dead. Yeah, I think, but I would just any girl listening, if anyone says we should go on our senior trip or maybe go to Aruba, uh, there's other areas you could go.

Speaker 1:          00:28:29       So weird man, but that is something that girls have to really worry about. They have to worry about being killed by a guy like that's a, that's a, that's a possibility. It's a rare possibility. But out of the 300 million people in this country, that's a big number. Every now and then one or two is going to pop up and God damn is it heartbreaking. Some fucking person who's attracted to the opposite sex but doesn't get what he wants so often and it's so psychopathic that he becomes angry at women and wants to kill them and they're out there. They're out there. Can you shed any city you go to like Vegas or Cam? Girls let their guard down and I'll see maybe because I'm older now and just about all of them could maybe be a dawn. Not, not really, but you look and you see them, they're drunk and they're.

Speaker 1:          00:29:14       And they think that bitchy voice that they have is going to be the protection. You know what I mean? Did that kind of. I'm that drunk chick kind of noise will examine their boss, I don't know where you are. And they're like in an alley in the middle of Tampa. You're like, what do you do it? Especially if they're like little children too. It's like, you know, you see some girls that are drunk and Vegas and be like 20 years old and hammered and you're like, wow, that's like a little child. She's just out there catching deck. I know I was in a,

Speaker 2:          00:29:42       you know, you don't think of them as little children when you're 20, when you're $20 checks now you see them. But when you're 40 and you look at 20 year olds, you go, wow, this is like the like childlike, you know, some of those poor girls, man, that Shit's going to program their life. Bad experiences when you're hammered at 20 around animals, that's a program your light. And it changed the way you behave or wherever. You know, just a few shitty decisions around the wrong people in the wrong crowd and just changes your opinion. I saw I've, wherever I was performing two weeks ago, the bouncer guys driving back to the hotel, there's a big huge dude which some really drunk like woman. I bet you she was 55 but kind of still sketched out and she was with another woman and the woman looked at the big guy and says, I don't know her.

Speaker 2:          00:30:31       I have her cell phone. I'm going to call her first thing in the morning to this big huge guy. And the guy didn't look at this. Other woman goes, come on, I'm not going to rape or whatever. He just looked at or whatever like that. And then this juncture chick got into the car and then they drove off and then that woman got got into the car. Wow. You're like, dude, what do you do? I mean, I think it was a guy picking up a drunk girl, but it was Kinda one of those. I had a moment where I could have stolen somebody's girlfriend recently if I was that type of guy. Stoller. Well it was, it would've been a cool movie thing. There's this girl at the gas station and she's got a tub of aloe about this big and Vera. Yeah, Kinda big thing of ice and she's icing.

Speaker 2:          00:31:13       The guy has one of those krautrock at motorcycles and it was about 110 outside and she obviously Burton her leg on the exhaust, so now they're, I think, you know, sitting by the gas pumps, the guys putting all this stuff on all this aloe. He's got his leather jacket, motorcycle. She looks so pissed like. But we've all seen pissed off girls before. But the look of just any come out even came out with one of those roses. Huh? And she got it and just set it down. Like if I was like one of those Douche bag you guys, all they would have had to done is this stick out my hand. Like every moving go take my hand and put her in my jeep and drove away. That guy would have been left right there. That's ridiculous that you would think that.

Speaker 4:          00:31:53       Yeah. Right. What do you think you are overconfident? You friendly? You know, you're like one of those guys like watch. She's going to turn around and look at me. No, no. The deal is I had a car though. She doesn't have. Didn't have to get back on that moment. Probably when the girl is putting aloe and ice on the inside of her leg. Yes. That's what I mean. I could have sold a right then you're delusional. My hand could have been a very good relationship and a guy just got a motorcycle. Motorcycles. They had a great time riding together and unfortunately she burned her leg, but she loves him and she loves being with the look on her. Just come along and like my hand. I would have said it way better words to, okay, Lin is not enough movies. I could trust me and if you want to live I could have said no, you need something better than that.

Speaker 4:          00:32:49       But that would have been the time we have four wheels. No, because look, he just made a mistake and the guy came back. He was being nice. He brought a rose. It's a nice gesture is obviously a nice person. He feels bad about it, of relieved that mistake and you come along and just try to steal your ridiculous. It's never gonna. Relive that mistake. You might have an Faq of cocaine and $100. That would have worked more than than that shit. That doesn't work. It just got off a motorcycle and cocaine in $100. She's like, I have a burn on my leg. I don't want any cocaine. She wants air conditioning and didn't you know, pants and not have to ride outside.

Speaker 3:          00:33:21       Hey, I got a cartoon to start watching. If you want to show you a little kids like a cartoon that they can fall in love with, but it will be awesome for you. That fit while being stoned. It's the best for the double. A level double level cartoon. It's called adventure time and it's just ventured time. Yeah, it is the most ridiculous fucking cartoon I've ever seen in my life and I'm so addicted to it and it's great for kids. Kids will just fucking sit there and love it today because it's all about princesses and princes and adventures with dragons and horses. But it is trippy as, what is it on a, it's on cartoon network. It's on all the time. Like I, I just dvr it like a schedule it and I think I got seven yesterday. So is it an animation one or.

Speaker 3:          00:34:07       Yeah, it's animation. It's kind of put to the same animation styles that game called Catamari, but it's very simple but very trippy, like a lot of dragons and swords. And when you say that it works on both levels of the, like peewee's playhouse kind of, but not the new peewee's playhouse? Yeah, they have to have it on showtime and that he, what he did is he did like a live thing throughout, you know, like Los Angeles for a while and then he took it on the road. I think he went to New York and he had like a live show of the playhouse and they filmed it for I think showtime or Hbo. But I try watching it and it's like completely a weird. Now, is it weird because you know he was beating off in a movie theater watching? No, it's weird because it's like, it's like he still looks pretty good, like he still looks pretty much like peewee, but it's just off a teeny bit where you're like, wait, he has a double Chin now. That's so, uh. Oh yeah. Right. He's got this sloppiness to them. They just kind of. I don't know. It's kind of weird.

Speaker 4:          00:35:04       I would like to see go see kits though. And it's Kinda the same. Yeah. I would like to see the video of peewee herman getting busted beating off. Do you know how awesome that would be? To have the video of him on his tongue out slow motion. I'm over and tell him to put his fucking Dick away and get up. Why would you? You would have been even bigger than he was proud of him. I know, right? Well that's the funny thing about that. A lot of times when things like that happen, there's a backlash, but it was sort of like an anti backlash with peewee Herman. They like liked him more, you know, now he

Speaker 1:          00:35:38       would have made more money if you go in route and you know why they liked him more because he's gay. He's a gay guy that got caught jerking off in public. This is my theory and he was he a straight guy that got caught jerking off in public. It might be a little more creepy because it's a gay guy, like poor little fella got nowhere to beat off. It can't be open about it and he's got to go watch string people. Fuck and concentrate on the Dicks, you know, can't even go to a gay place because he's famous.

Speaker 2:          00:36:06       Well, when that happened though, didn't he lose his show and actually knocked him, you know, he was really popular. That happened and then people took, took them off to shell lake. So we kind of lost it. I might not know what the fuck I'm talking about. I'm talking about what happened in the court of public opinion

Speaker 1:          00:36:20       maybe in the financial world that devastated him. I don't know what the court of public opinion. I felt like he did better. I don't know what other shows. Did he have a show still? Because it was not that. It was a long ass time ago that when was the last movie? House was on. He had the two movies that came after that. Oh, this was probably in the late eighties where he got arrested. No, but like we're at its height of popularity and pee wee's big adventure. So Papa got rested in the early nineties. I remember I went to see peewee's playhouse with my then girlfriend at the time who was also very silly. She was a silly girl. She was a good person. Go see movies with and we were fucking car riding, laughing. I thought it was the funniest thing I'd ever seen. I was like, I was a huge peewee Herman Fan, you know? It was just so ridiculous.

Speaker 2:          00:37:10       Large Marge Center. We do that all the time. Yeah. You just have all these random away. He would like be in love with the girl and bring her flowers and stuff. It was so bizarre. It's like, God, what a fun. Like a fun, silly.

Speaker 3:          00:37:29       Do you know? Do you know our friend Jeff Scott is the number one peewee Herman and personally I used to remember watching pm magazine, which was a show and I think the Midwest, I don't even think I would imagine. And I had it in Detroit. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. And they interviewed him. I remember watching that episode and then written. Now we'll just find out.

Speaker 2:          00:37:45       That was back when, uh, uh, there was a show called. Kids are people too. That's incredible. That's incredible. You remember? That's incredible. What was the other ones came on right before the right. I was always a real no real people. That was the original youtube. It was really incredible. Was the original Youtube think?

Speaker 3:          00:38:02       I love that. Remember the old Ed Mcmahon, a peep practical joke show that used to be really big. Oh yeah. It was a TV bloopers and practical jokes and had the cartoons from the game show with the whammies. Yeah. What's that called? No, whammies. No whammies. Stop. Press your luck. They used to have those whammies. Yeah. And that. And for some reason those whammies were so popular that when that game show was canceled, they were like, we're going to use the whammies on this show now. It was just like, was just like, wow, you're just using cartoons from a different games. Just continued the family tradition. Yeah, it was. I looked at my

Speaker 1:          00:38:35       watch real people episode on Youtube recently and it was all just, it was all just crazy. And then we're going to go to Wisconsin when this guy may can jump 5,000 feet into cheese. It was like all just random random stuff. And if you look at it like it's this person has every coke can ever make the all would have their own shows. Now if you look how crazy these people and every one of them would have a show on discovery or an a and e, there'd be a reality show about every story with the people that Byron Allen was like, what the fuck is with these pawn shops? They're all. It hit the bottom when they were following guys who are driving on slippery roads. Yeah. Ice Road truckers. Road is slippery. You did a truck seven years. Nobody's falling in the same fucking show every week.

Speaker 1:          00:39:23       The guys on the ice road. Oh, was getting slippery. Yeah, I mean I thought that was dumb until I watched one of these auction shows the other day. No pawn shop. So rather where the dude wasn't even a pawn shop. So it was like a bargain sort of a show. He shows up, a guy's got a sign. He goes, how much you want for this sign? Oh, I'm not looking to sell it. What if I give you 500 bucks? No, no, I don't think that'd be enough. What if I gave you a thousand bucks? Well, now you're making me think. I'm like, what the fuck? Really? This is the show with the two brothers and one guy. One guy buys it. I didn't get that far. I didn't get that far. They were just trying to buy a coca cola sign from some dudes. I wanted to punch the screen, but it's 100 times better than that show on true TV.

Speaker 1:          00:40:02       The pawn shop show that's completely fake, but yet everyone was like, the only thing in it for the person watching was you want to find out how it ended. How did it get resolved? It's like this, but it's like the lowest level entertainment ever. It's guy give you 100 bucks. No bugs. No, no. I'll give you 500 bucks. Well, no, you're making me think like you're sitting there with your mouth open, waiting to see things. Doing boom days. When the pond pawn shop owners had a amp and that was all the went down through. All creeps right in. They all have an expert. They're like, well, luckily I called the expert of 18, 22 bullets. No, you don't punch punc guys don't have a team of experts. Most pawn shop guys are kind of creepy, right?

Speaker 1:          00:40:53       But I've known about pawn shops is pool hall dudes who always would sell stolen shit. The pawn shops. Yeah. They don't have a guy going in there showing you trying to sell pool cues to buy crack and I know I do do it. A housekeeper and they caught the housekeeper selling shit. The pawn shops, they found a shit at trace some of them. One of their things and turned out it was sold at a certain punch up there fucking housekeeper. We're stealing their shit and bringing it to pawnshops. Oh Shit Dude. Can you imagine having a pawn shot that was also a check cashing place and how much that would be. It'd be robbed and. Well they give you a cashier so it's technically actually it'd be the wrong thing. You will want to check crush in place there now, but it's like

Speaker 3:          00:41:34       it doesn't make sense. It's just a all for one and I don't have any money. Look, my, my dad does not go to cash checking places or pawn shops. So it seems like the people, the clientele, those two places seem like they would enjoy a place that they can go to do both if they have to. I guess that makes sense, but it doesn't make sense because it's two totally different things. Like you're totally broke. You have no money coming in. So you sell a stolen TV. Right? To cash. Because my time is spent, I'll give everything in a bar on one. Didn't you say you got your dad? Hi once talking about that? No, I didn't get them high. I just saw it was when I had a thing of weed soda and it tastes like Cola and he was like, you're already taking a drink.

Speaker 3:          00:42:23       And I gave him some weed. Soda. Do you ever know what happened? He was having a great time laughing and telling funny stories and giggling. It was, it was awesome. Did you tell him you tell him that you could have a day like this everyday now because we were drinking wine also. So I, uh, I think he just probably thought that. Wow, that was something good wine. Why don't you just tell him that gave him some weed. Soda will come on man. That's great. Now why do you think that generation? Why don't you tell him? Huh? Why don't you tell Him Dad? He had a great time because you were, you drinking weed soda? Because he has a job and if they knew the contest you are. Everyone lives in California. We'll do a lot of places. Don't pee test their employees. I don't think. I don't think it's a majority to fucking pee.

Speaker 3:          00:43:10       Test that work at gateway. Definitely test to work at starbucks. Not Any starbucks people. They can't smoke week because I get tested. Hold on a second. Stop it. Yes. You're talking about burrows. Most. Most major jobs. You have to pee tests and I do not think you're right. I do not think you have to pee. Test. Hold on. Just make that up. I had to pee. Test twice the work at gateway. Did you say that about starbucks? No. Google it. We have google right here. Starbucks employees. That's incredible. If it's true, what if it's true? I'm going to start going to coffee bean. Any major company has to do it for insurance reasons though. Not really. Yeah, it's, it's, it's, it's a, it's like a rule, you know, for, uh, for most big companies that their insurances are so high that they have to do shit like that.

Speaker 1:          00:43:59       At the starbucks where I worked as a Barista, there was no drug testing. No drug testing was ever performed. Thing is working at it, it certainly did not do random drug testing either as far as drug testing. If you get injured while working. I do not know what the policy is, but starbucks is not really a laid back place to work.

Speaker 5:          00:44:18       Um,

Speaker 3:          00:44:20       okay. Well starbucks doesn't. But what the fuck kind of places do though? When I, when I worked for Brian saying that starbucks does to work as a fucking Burrito

Speaker 3:          00:44:32       is a ridiculous thing and you like you don't say stipe miocic invoke with starbucks. What I was talking about is most companies nowadays do require drug testings. I worked, I worked at a lot of places. Joe Not long ago, seven years ago I was waiting tables. I worked at a lot of companies that drug tested. I had to do it all the time and they got some terrible news today, by the way, fashion Irma's. What percentage do you think what percentage of companies drug tests they're out of like the last five real jobs I had, I probably got drug tested at three of those five jobs and these are defined divine search search by going what? Fortune 500 because they would have the money to do it. That's not. No, it's pretty normal for companies that drug test outside of California. It. That's all I'm saying is that I wasn't saying starbucks as starbucks. I'm saying companies like starbucks and things like that. Main major companies. I would.

Speaker 1:          00:45:27       Are you ready for reality? Okay. Here it is. Major Laboratory testing company offered the cheery news recently that the percentage of American workers who tested positive for illegal drugs last year was the lowest ever. So people are testing. The cheery news is that

Speaker 3:          00:45:43       people aren't used to be drug as much because they're buying shit at waterbed stores like myself called waterbeds and company and it was a $20 talking about drugs. $40 investment and people aren't watching it. That quote saying that is that he, that he's as good news that people aren't testing positive for drugs. What are you talking about? Waterbeds? Uh, they sell at head shops in Ohio and in the midwest they don't have head shops like marijuana store. So they sell, like they have companies like waterbed stores that sell head stuff, supplies in it. There's a place called water beds and stuff in Ohio. Didn't expect anyone else to know. I was explaining it. Then you stopped when you were. I was, I was just getting to this point anyway. And they sell for $40. He so feisty. Today is your fucking sativa six. I got a no, you need to learn how to handle it. But, but, but uh, they sell this shit that you drink, that you drink right before you take a drug test. And so what you're pretty much doing is you're pissing out this shit that's kind of like they just did a big thing in.

Speaker 1:          00:46:42       Can't answer this question. I'm answering this question. What percentage of companies drug test their employees. I pumped this into Google. Give me an answer,

Speaker 3:          00:46:49       bitch. It's funny how long Google questions. How now when you first came out, you pick up two words like drug testing. Go, screw it. I'm just going to write an entire paragraph from see what happened. But in Florida they had, um, the, they tested everybody on welfare and uh, you know, like that's a big thing is you have to get tested drug tested before you get the welfare check. Ninety eight percent passed.

Speaker 1:          00:47:09       Whoa. Hold on a second. Listen to this shit. And six survey by the Society for human resource management found that 84 percent of employers required new hires to hirees to pass drug screenings.

Speaker 3:          00:47:27       Sad. He's been in California long, just 39 percent random

Speaker 1:          00:47:31       early testing employees after they were hired. Holy Shit. In addition, 73 percent tested workers when drug use was suspected and 58 percent required testing after accidents on the job. Whoa. What the fuck, man,

Speaker 4:          00:47:49       that's a lot of new hires that you do trouble. That is a horrible thing, man.

Speaker 1:          00:47:55       Eighty four percent of employers were crying. We're crying paper to take drug tests. Wow, that's incredible. That's so discriminatory. You know, especially for things that stay in your system but aren't as damaging. Like we'd. Whereas cocaine is out of your system. You take it on a Friday, you'll, you'll pass a drug test on a Monday. It's a quick thing, it gets out of your system quick unless I think they test your hair. I think if they test your hair, they can find it a little longer

Speaker 3:          00:48:22       and at the waterbed store they have a shampoo that you put on their hair if they do test your hair and that's really. It's crazy that this water pet store in Columbus, Ohio, still in business and waterbed,

Speaker 4:          00:48:33       not waterbed and stuff. I love that store. I love water beds and stuff. You got to go do it. Next time you're in Ohio, I don't think I do pass on that stupid fucking store. They have shipper. Every drug test. Your waterbed would actually smelled like bong water and be kind of crappy to sleep or the water. The worst thing ever is you have a waterbed and the power goes out and then waterbeds not hot anymore and it fucking polls heat off your body like you don't realize. It's actually kind of dangerous man. Like you don't want to have a black and white, furry a bedspread. Think everybody who I've ever met that had a lot of my probably done at one point in time. It was a good waterbed though, but they suck for fucking.

Speaker 3:          00:49:09       My cat popped mine while we were fucking and fucking look at book, but what happened is we both woke up at the same time,

Speaker 4:          00:49:23       but you said we're not. Me and my cat were fucking.

Speaker 3:          00:49:26       No, I wasn't finding the cat, but the cat popped it while I was fucking a girl. It was like something like tweet. There was so I didn't know it was the second I'm is trying to bring you back to reality wasn't the waterbed. Ips was just pushing all the pis out.

Speaker 4:          00:49:46       Brian, you need to go to adult. Brian.

Speaker 3:          00:49:48       That's what you're telling you. Put it off forever. I rewatched the last Joey Diaz podcast last night and that's the funny thing because when Joey Diaz is going crazy, you kept on going, you need to go to a doctor, you need to go to a doctor

Speaker 4:          00:50:06       like a yelling Dr. crazy doctor need to talk to somebody.

More content from Joey. Anything. Anything he does is awesome. You know, he's such an enigma, such an unusual person. I've never met anybody that I'll let you yell at me like Joey, but he's like, it's all. You just weather the storm. It's like, you know, it's not even, it's almost like, not even real.

Speaker 1:          00:51:11       Like, all right joey, you still mad at me. You done. You done. Tell him when he died. I watched that video. You posted that video. Posted what you were doing. What?

Was that the guy that you didn't, was it a radio show you did? Were you invited him in? I saw that color. The Alex Jones show. Yeah. What happened after that? But like after that, when you said the dude was baffled. Oh, stones sat there in a pile of rubble until what the fuck happened to his show? I mean, could you imagine man, if you've got to doom or gloom doom and gloom show and those of you who haven't seen it, just google did some dude.

Speaker 1:          00:51:59       Dude did a good fellows version of it, which is fucking hilarious. I wish I knew the, the, the um, the, the youtube and look up goodfellas. Joe Diaz. Alex Jones. I don't know, you could find it in any way. The um, the, what was hilarious about it is houses too, so serious. It's all doom and gloom and the government and the CIA has been spotted in Nicaragua with tons of cocaine and he just like fuck. And to have a guy like joey come in and just wreck shop, just completely ridiculous and going for the laugh, you know, I thought I had Karen. My left balls bigger than I write. I thought I had cancer and to do it in just this guy's got his fucking empire of doom and gloom. He's got this empire of the fucking end of the world is here and this is what he's selling.

Speaker 1:          00:52:51       This is entertainment. And he's my friend and we just walked in and just gave him silly is this is, this is, here's some ridiculous motherfucker. Here's a human cartoon. We're both high as Brian is. So Hi, Brian is sitting there with little esther. They're sitting on the floor watching at the, on the bottom. I'm like under the desk, like we'll just sit here and watch it. They wanted to be inside watching. And Brian's filming it and him and little esther, a giggling dude. That was one of the greatest moments of my life. That was one of the funniest things I've ever seen. He was alive at the time. He was doing that? Yeah. Oh, so we're on the Internet. That's how all these videos are over. And he said there's a dump on. I know when I did radio dump or. Oh No. So he doesn't have anything dumping when he's online.

Speaker 1:          00:53:35       When he's online. The online version is uncensored, wasn't he? Wasn't he broadcasting? No, live to like tons of radio. That's why I told them where he was, why I was on the first 45 minutes while I was on. It was just me and him. And then we will. Okay. We're going to do this next one. We're going to live on the internet, but don't swear if you do, it's okay. But that's what he said. Say that I hope he's okay. By the way, if you've been watching the news about Austin and all the fires is bad. Oh, it's super bad. Like tons of how I saw Dale Dudley posted something on twitter about it, that it took them like two and a half hours to get home and it's scary. I get a lot of people are losing their houses in Austin, right to wildfires are fucking nuts. I've been in a few of them now.

Speaker 1:          00:54:16       I've been evacuated from my house on three separate occasions, twice in this house, twice in my other house. It's fucking scary as shit. How do you decide? Because I just had a conversation with my wife because we have no exit plan for zombies. Earthquake, fire, nothing. We have nothing. Now. How do you know what to grab? That's the one thing that you need to grab anything, man. Grab your fucking kids and then forward and don't stop thinking about your shit because it's over man. You could reaccumulated shit. You know you need to get the fuck out. When you. When you get to a situation like that, you know what you need. You need your credit cards. You need your fucking a laptop. If you can get it and some clothes for a few days, just fucking run because they swarm on you so fast. This is how fast those fucking fires are.

Speaker 1:          00:54:56       Man. We were in lake t han, which is like over an hour north and you have to take the five past Santa Clarita, so I'm on the five up near Santa Clarita and the fire is right there. It's like Razah. I'm driving to work. It's like 10:00 in the morning as I'm going to work. It's like right down. I'm like, Whoa, fuck. Like this. It looks bad. It looks bad. I mean it was a big fire. So I'm at work. We're filming fear factor. We filmed for about three or four hours. We get done with the stunt and we see smoke coming over the mountain. Now this is over an hour and a half of driving 70 miles an hour. The fire got to where I was and just a few hours, so I leave. I get on the fucking highway and the entire way home, the whole right side of the highway is ablaze like a horror movie because it's nighttime and it looks like a scene from the Hobbit, like I'm waiting for demons to come riding black horses with fiery eyes.

Speaker 1:          00:55:54       I mean it's fucking terrifying man. And I tried to take some photos. I saw we also saw a dead guy there too. I think it talked about that. So I got to get hit by a car. Mac units actually saw one of the producers of fear factor. He saw the guy's body. He didn't. I don't think he actually saw the impact. I think he just saw it right after it happened. I thought I felt somebody you hit one. I still had that vision in my head. You can't try to want to cross the highway, man. People can't stop that fast. You gotta be able to gauge how fast a person can stop. You know, like a race car can stop 96 feet from like 100 miles an hour. You know, that's a race car. That's a lot of fucking a distance man. Ninety six feet screeching coming towards you, a giant hunk of metal.

Speaker 1:          00:56:36       That's if two people are actually paying attention. Texting or something like. Yeah, no shit. You gotta be careful. There's people who do tax on the highway, which is amazing that I see it a lot now you see I'm just looking down and just Kinda motherfuckers motherfuckers, you know, someone that Jon Anik from a at espns mma live, you know that show the van. Okay. Yeah. He always says don't text and drive. It says at the end of every show. It's such a good thing to do. Just put it in people's heads. Don't do it like Bob Barker. I think texts and drives better. Depends what a fuck. But that's an unfortunate. But Hey, Bob Barker is a good guy. Just trying to make sure there's not any unwanted puppies. Trisha little messages. Little little. Uh, yeah. You just gotTa people have little tags. Goldie has one. When I work with my Goldberg, when it fights over, it's always over. Yes,

Speaker 3:          00:57:29       sure. Do you know who tyler the Creator is who? Tyler. The Creator is your wrapper? Yes. He's really young. He's like 20 years old and uh, I've been falling as twitter for a bit now, but I guess he just wants something at the video movie awards is. Twitter is pretty funny. Side Fuck Tyler on twitter. But uh, he, he's just this little young kid, but he has those rafts. Twitter is called Fuck Tyler. Yeah. And he has this type that right. You're really weird. Like it's going to pop up. I, I just, I'm a big fan. I think you might like, um, check out his raps. He w what's really cool is he's not one of those guys that come and he's got 545,000 followers. He's fucking brilliant. Really. I love the students. I love this guy. Damn. How do I not know about this guy?

Speaker 3:          00:58:10       He's like, what he's called like horror rap is what he gets tagged as with horror. Horror. Horror monsters are heart. Yeah. One note kind of like, I guess scary rap. Like I saw one of his videos were like, everyone's has guns in her hands and stuff. Kind of like maybe like, like a new version of Nwa, you know, kind of like a scarface. Remember when scarface and Geto boys were, they were considered horror. Kind of like, I've never heard the tester wrap, I guess horror, horror. Romp. Yeah. Remember the Geto boys was out there kind of like, you kind of believed that they were like a gang almost, you know, and every fucking bullets in their eyes coming out of sockets and tried to kill himself, didn't he? I don't remember. I thought he got shot in the eye or something. I don't know. I think he didn't. He what happened? I don't know what happened to that guy. I'm going to. I'm just sort of trying to think of the horror rap, but there's a, there's a sweet 16

Speaker 1:          00:58:57       killed them. Tried to kill himself. I think he was high on everclear and Cho shot himself in the face.

Speaker 3:          00:59:01       There's a really cool video that, that you need to see if tyler, the creator, it's called Yonkers,

Speaker 1:          00:59:06       need to know the answer to that Bushwick bill shot himself, but you got yonkers Joe. See that guy. That is not going to be saying that because I'm a. I'm a fan.

Speaker 3:          00:59:19       You know what sucks about liking people like tyler, the creator though is like they have a live show in la, but I'd be too scared to go there. I got. I got beat up by all of you guys because I feel like a hanging around with black eyes. Well I can't. I believe that the, probably the majority of the people that like them are probably like, you know, like a little bit rougher than me. They, they would see me and tried to rape me or something. I was at Curtis blow new edition wizards everywhere. Utfo concert in Detroit to when I was 16 and we got beat up really?

Speaker 1:          00:59:53       Okay in 1991 in Bushwick. Bill, either in a suicidal funk or a drunken rage or as a scheme to have his mother collect on his insurance policy. Uh, he began goating is 17 year old girlfriend and shooting him. Wow. Reports say he had threatened to harm the child they had together if she refused to go through with the deed would actually transpired. Has never been divulged by either party involved, but either his or her hand by either his or her hand build. Caught a slug in his right eye. Whoa, shoot me. We're going to make some money. And insurance policy. Holy Shit to a sex tape was before that. Wow. But he had already had like a bunch of. Didn't they have like hit songs already? Who could he not do shows or something like where's this money going? I needed money that badly. You it to get shot for insurance money. I mean they were famous. I didn't really think. Yeah, you really didn't think that through. And by the way, I don't think, uh, the, the first sex tape I think was that dude from Hogan's heroes do it. I'll always be a Bushwick bill fan from that song. Fuck a war. You know that song? The only play that on the podcast once. Yeah. It's a great fucking jam. Bushwick bills. Fuck a war is just, just for that alone. The dude gets my respect forever. He can go shoot himself. Go ahead.

Speaker 3:          01:01:16       So did you ever one of those Coca Cola that were popular, that Jersey Jersey cocacola shirts that were really popular? I don't know what you're talking about. Do you notice your. I don't. Jersey. Did they sell it at chess king? No. No. Maybe that was wholly country. They used to have these jerseys that just had like the stripe across it. They said Coca Cola and it was a stripe on the arms and the striking. I don't know what you're talking about. Like hockey, Jersey or basketball? No, Not Jersey. Like Sports Jersey. Like polo shirts kind of remembered. That was a phase where people wore a lot of. Yeah, like Coca Cola just started making clothes. How you would actually let become popular.

Speaker 1:          01:01:50       I think there's someone knocking on the door. Was that someone not going to donate? What do you. What Patrick? Is that Joey know that you heard that right? Yeah. Maybe he's knocking on the front girl from door knocking up a girl and just ask if someone's talking in the front door. Joey Diaz is on his way over here. Ladies and gentlemen. Is it? Oh, is that. That window is outside the door. Hold on folks. Oh, Jesus Christ.

Speaker 3:          01:02:16       Did you know they're making a sequel to knocked up? Hey John,

Speaker 4:          01:02:20       did you know that they're making a secret that knocked up? No, I didn't. Sorry about that guys. We were trying to figure out where you are now. A burglar how to jump the fence. Joey Diaz. This now just walked into the building. We're high as fuck and fucking headphones on. We had no idea where that noise was coming from. You. We're not going to do what we were looking. I don't want to call. It was a waste of time. What's happening? Hey, hold on. So just to cover what we're talking about, Brian was hypnotizing us with some story about jerseys were you wore Coca Cola Jersey Hook a cooler shirts in the eighties that were really popular. That was like kind of like a polo shirt. A red shirt. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I remember the red shirt. Yeah. You guys remember? We have no idea. They have no idea what I don't know about the hypnotize.

Speaker 4:          01:03:02       I was never hypnotized by it. Now I know the show you're talking about the Rick Coca Cola hypnotized by his story because it was so ridiculous. I was like, no, it's crazy. I walked in. I'm glad you're here to defend him. Otherwise, really good attack. We were just mounting up or attack right now. Motherfucker. What's Joe Diaz in the fucking house pitches Malibu and got hit in the fucking leg. This rock, those eight foot waves. Oh, bring them in fucking rocks though. Yeah, that thing knocked me over. I mean it was. I was. My foot was on the Rock and a rock squished my flux and fung Geico.

Speaker 1:          01:03:38       My uncle lives on the Jersey shore and um, he got a. He made a video of waves fucking up the Jersey shore. Like how bad a irene crushed everything. Holy Fuck. It's nuts. It's Newark is really bad. Middle New Jersey is fucking bad, man. It's crazy. Vermont got fucked up. Vermont. You know what the really crazy thing was looking at the satellite image of how big the hurricane was when they talked about it was going to take two days to reach Vermont from Florida and North Carolina. I remember looking at the picture, I'm like, that is that what the. The scale tree, that's a country of a storm flying overhead. It looked like bigger than most European kind. Like bigger than Germany or something like that. You know, like what's a small European country? It was way bigger than that. It was huge. Some of those countries in, in, in, in, in Europe, very small and very close to each other.

Speaker 1:          01:04:32       You know, these fucking, this, this, this hurricane was bigger than a couple of countries. It's fucking nuts, man. It ain't no, but I think we'll get one this year. That'll damage at least one. Is that the biggest one of all time now on that side of the country, what's the biggest one of all times, Gloria, because I remember when I was a kid, Hurricane Gloria hit. I don't remember. Katrina wouldn't be the. The biggest one was the one of the most devastating, but that was also because we're it hit it hit New Orleans, which is really crazy that no, no big ones ever hit New Orleans before and it's running a fucking. You just got lucky. It's like you talk about like living anywhere tornadoes hit. It's just like totally like playing craps. One day this guy becomes an angry monster and destroy an town.

Speaker 6:          01:05:18       You see those pictures they had in Tuscaloosa, Alabama on fucking believe in Joplin. The whole place is gone. God Don, that's Joplin, Missouri. Yeah. They always get fucking whack, bro. They get whacked, hard, crazy, crazy man that people choose to stay in places like that where they can economically. Yeah, I mean there's no quick in the east coast, not. We're not safe anywhere where you are in tornado alley, earthquake or hurricane alley. That's true. That's true. You know, I was, I was at Malibu area that I'm looking at these waves and I'm looking at the intensity and for one second I thought about what if there is a fucking tsunami and malleable. What if I was sitting there going, what if a little fucking earthquake. That's a wild ocean out there and the ocean is just wild. It's, it's the blood of the earth, you know, it's 60 percent or whatever. The fucking coverage is more than 70. Baffles the fuck out of me since I was a kid, so I don't fuck with it.

Speaker 6:          01:06:11       Almost drying in coney island and almost drowned as a kid in coney island and I was out there, you know, up to your waist, playing with a ball and all of a sudden you know, something just sucks you in, you don't know what. And next thing you know, you're in a fucking toe and you know what man or what do they call him? Mr. But yeah, undertow or riptide? No. Undertaking a rip tide or under both of them. The same. I don't mind pools and shit. I know people pissing them and shit, but the folk that oceans are different items, you know, I didn't even know. Look, I got clocked by a rock. That's a creepy feeling too. When you feel the undertow or the riptide, whatever the fuck it is. Pulling you back. Yeah. We used to go to the ocean trying to pull you into it.

Speaker 6:          01:06:48       Remember you look back and see your mom finally, like, get the fuck in and you're like my wife and it's sucking you in and I'll send you. Just go from five feet to 15 feet and now you're caught in that fucking a. it's a very, uh, scary actually when you're being pulled, swim, don't fight it, you know, grateful and save somebody. Some girl, he was on vacation and Greg Fitzsimmons is not like the most fit guy. He's a small dude. And he said some girl got pulled away by the, by the, the time. And she started screaming and he realized she couldn't swim very well and he went, oh fuck. And he had a moment to decide what to do. And he jumped in. Oh, she didn't. When he was there with his family. You got to be careful about that man, because you know what happens.

Speaker 6:          01:07:29       People drown you if you don't really know how to rescue someone, grab a hold of them. They panic and they drag you under. That's fucking dangerous shit, man. Rescuing someone. It's very hard to do. You gotta really know what the fuck you're doing. That's about the ocean. The first time I moved to California, I went wake boarding. We went out in the thing and a huge way, but I missed it. I didn't know to go under, I didn't know that shit. The board under in pop up, so I rode so it took me nine feet in the air and threw me backwards and then pin me and ever since then I haven't done it again. We are too afraid to like, cause I just got my ass kicked so bad that one particular time. I'm like, man, I'm gonna hear from the land. The rivers up there fucking mosquitoes. It's the worst thing you run into. Got a pontoon boat. Somebody that's a different fucking he mosquitoes

Speaker 7:          01:08:16       on the leg. They're pretty bad. They, they'll pick you the fuck up man. Pick you to fuck up and put you somewhere else. They got those blanket. Just Rub Bacon. Milk

Speaker 1:          01:08:26       water on the east coast. I used to, there was A. Charles River was near my house in the east coast and I went into the bushes one time with this chick and we're fucking around and we had her pants down. We had to stop because we're getting bits so bad. It's like our legs were just covered with welts. The mosquitoes just swarmed on you. They smell all that pink, 17 year old flesh. I just dove on us. It started fucking. I was like, it was brutal. I remember the next day all my legs covered in little tiny scabs. He just got attacked by a swarm. I still remember some of the worst nights when that one mosquito would get into your bedroom and your dad didn't put on the air, so it was probably your sleeping and 85 year old weather and you just hear the one fucking step one and you can Rudel I rented a house once and nobody had lived in the house for a couple of years and uh, they had left all the water in the pool.

Speaker 1:          01:09:18       So I got there and the pool was fucking green man. I mean green like pea soup. And I looked in it and I see like these schools and I go, what the fuck is that? Schools have these little tiny bugs swimming. I'm talking hundreds of thousands, hundreds of thousands, 20. When the guy goes, oh shit, I go, why? He goes, those are mosquito larva are going to look what? What? We had a problem. I go with you, so when is this going to hatch? It goes, this could hatch any day. Now I'm like, Holy Shit. So this has just been providing mosquitoes to the entire community for years. This big pool of mosquitoes, man. So this guy had a pump gallons and gallons and gallons of poisoning. It took like two weeks to clean that fucking thing out. He had to pump the filter and pump all the chlorine and gallons and gallons of Korean. Then drain all the water out because it was too poisonous and put new water in it it because you couldn't just drain it and you have all these fucking bugs floating around in the water. I'm talking literally hundreds of pounds of mosquitoes. It was crazy.

Speaker 7:          01:10:27       No, it's crazy. We're not all fucking as old as I am, but what about having to off that shit? Don't work no more. Somebody told me about six years ago I went somewhere and they don't work no more brothers and for eighties mosquitoes, David Galligan the back routes. Now they don't even push you off. All fucking come. Remember when we were kids, you could like the thing, you don't like the thing and then you can hang out and I miss citronella candle. No, the one made by all off was a wave. It was a circle, so when it burned at the end, you knew you had to go in. That's when you got to go in. Now those mosquitoes, that's like nothing. They're like fucking off. You're going to put off on you. They don't even advertise it no more. I think about it. What happened off dot these mosquitoes. Those don't even respect off no more. It's like off. That's old bitch.

Speaker 1:          01:11:16       Don't go out until you got you got it. Smells like nobody uses off no more. It's still there because I checked it. Just people know that shit. Don't worry. That'll even if it doesn't work, it's probably poisonous. You pour in your pouring something on your body that makes you unattractive. We use the spray. Probably not good for you to fucking little skin is the biggest organ in your body when you're spraying stuff. Says the man with tattoos all over his fucking talking about. I got increments. Kin, but spraying anything on your skin like Alexi, even sunscreen is going to be absorbed. Those chemicals are going to be absorbed. It's used to run behind the. There used to be a truck that is a little bit older. Me, the truck would drive down the street with just poison. Shoot it into there to kill all. Oh yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:12:00       I guess like maybe our grandparents, but the kids used to follow it like an ice cream truck and just run down the street behind the smoke. That's what I do. There's some guys in my neighborhood, I don't know what the deal is, what they're killing, but they were walking around the other day with fucking masks on their face with these white suits on and they had these little plastic spray jugs and they're spraying this shit on the side of the road. I'm like, what the fuck could you be spraying in the road that I want you to spray on the road while you're wearing a gas mask? You know, do you have just an excess amount of this shit need to kill weeds? Was somebody getting hayfever? You know, come on man. I mean, you want to hire somebody to cut it down, then you're making new jobs, but spraying poison on the side of the road.

Speaker 1:          01:12:41       Is that really necessarily with who the fuck says okay to that? Isn't there laws against that shit? What are they doing? You couldn't be bugs much and if they have to still do it, they must do. Well, I saw them do it, but what we mean, what are they doing? What are they spraying and spraying for weeds? I think it's mosquitoes scheme side of the road and read about you. You right on the side of the road. I think that in the middle of the night it used to just a thing. Right? I don't know. I'd say weeds over bugs. Weeds. I don't think it's bugs. Yeah. There's no way. Don't have it or they don't really kill that many bugs because the problem with killing bugs, it's some crazy ecosystem out there, man. There's a whole sort of a cycle too. And if you squash one thing like mosquitoes or bugs did, you might fuck up some other part of the ecosystem along with it.

Speaker 1:          01:13:29       And my kill birds, you see the guy, there's a guy who made an entire ecosystem in his house and that's how he keeps spiders and flies away from, I don't know the exact number. He has hundreds of different bugs species that eat each other and he has perimeters in his house. It's an entire. So he leaves a flies but then the spiders come and make the thing. But then despite. Or is it, I saw it. I think he has an entire. That's his bug system and they don't. And he has perimeter set up and they don't leave the perimeter. So by the time you were in his house, nothing will look man, if you look at the animals that eat other animals, the thing, but he's got it all figured out. It sounded supposed to be set up. So there's a, there's a, I guess if you paid attention to it and you find out what the prey and what things eat

Speaker 6:          01:14:12       and what they get from everything. He knows the whole system. That's fascinating man. I want to. How much effort he has to put into. It was crazy. It was like a whole, like something you'd see at a zoo, like that's his life's work. It's like a hip bone connected to the joint bone. It's like there's something always fucking doing, you know, somebodies always eating somebody. Yeah. That's why I don't have hormones anymore. I had the personas are a pain in the ass man. First of all, you have to clean that tank like every couple of days because they, they eat massey. It's exciting when they eat the messy, but they're only exciting when they're eating, when they're eating. It's crazy to watch them and I would feed them goldfish and they would go on a rampage. It was incredible. It was a goldfish. You think you're going to some little kid who's got an idea and you're going to fly around the.

Speaker 6:          01:14:53       You know what? I would them. It traumatized me as a kid. I used to fish for goldfish. The goldfish in the New York. The weirdest thing because you get to my luggage and river, which is murky. You put them into clean water and they died. What the fuck? You been living in that shit? Water for 10 years. I bring you home, I'll give you a love of Goldfish in the central park. When I was a kid in central park bench, I'm just a little fucking thing or that. Oh, there were probably part. Yeah. You probably like the little paddle boats and central park and you probably know those are other goldfish. Goldfish, goldfish and go, you don't want to catch nothing. None of that fucking Hudson. I seen a friend of mine either

Speaker 7:          01:15:32       eels heart one time on the Hudson. I bet that motherfucker glowed in the dark when I was a kid when I was a kid. It was funny because Puerto Rican lived in the bronx and Brooklyn. It's so weird how the the nationality thing goes, but Puerto Rican big weekend out in the old days was to go to Jersey. If you watch cop land, you catch the black people under the bridge of salons, given them a ticket and they're like, that's the last time we'll come over to Jersey because that was a big thing. As bad as people put Jersey, it's got a little couple of sightseeing things, especially like some people rent the car to go to Jersey on the weekends. How fucking crazy is that? Puerto Ricans would drive over the bridge, got under the Hudson in that disgusting murky water. They will dig up a fucking barbecue pit that had been there since 1920 and it was business as usual.

Speaker 7:          01:16:21       You know, they pull up with a car and Puerto Rican is a famous, you know, I come out of the car, tend to a car. That's no the thing, it's the shit that was in the car. The grill, the couch, the 12 piece and Mumbo fucking band. I mean, they're amazing. And you go under the Hudson Bridge and here these people on this disgusting water is life is. They're just making the best of what they had. They came from the fucking bronx in the seventies, which had nothing. You know, they just dug the Bronx river out. Did you read what they found in? No buildings. Why? Like people were throwing buildings and cars and they're like, that Nino, the Hudson, the, the, all that shit is. So they have destroyed that. The pollution levels. I watched the show, the idea by plastic. I did not know.

Speaker 6:          01:17:03       Do you think it's inevitable that if you get 7 million people living on an island like Manhattan, that you have to just put it to do when you just look at any random stall at a public restroom that's only 10 people going in and not giving a shit, you know, it's like your animals. Like, like no one knows what. I think guys just getting like a pop song. Go. I'm just going to piss all over the place. What the fuck is wrong with people people's last week. And Anthony Bourdain? Yes. Beautiful City. How about the garbage? Yeah. How about the garbage? They don't pick up garbage can imagine living your life with garbage out. You know what that smells like after a week or week, this fucking weather Japan to Harlem to play one pocket. My uh, my friend Johnny B and Mount Vernon and Tommy and this dude won. We all went to Harlem to play, uh, some pimps, pimps would be gambling, playing pool and so they would spend a lot of money.

Speaker 6:          01:17:51       So the word got out, it was like 125th street in Harlem, maybe even higher than that. We got there and there are apparently some garbage strike and the garbage was seven feet to eight feet high for a whole block. I mean a whole block dude. It was nuts. People would just step outside and throw the garbage on a pile and there was a rat everywhere. Every rentable, because there's bags of food, there's bags of things that rats can eat. I'm talking literally a block of eight foot high piles of garbage. It was horrifying, man. My friends worked for hunt chemical and it went to India. They all got transferred to India and in the early nineties they came back and they were telling me stories about how they don't kill rats there. You pull up at night with your car, you know how you see a raccoon or a fucking cat.

Speaker 6:          01:18:37       It just be wrapped and your garbage. You have to sit there for 10 minutes and let them run out of the fucking garbage before you get out of the car. I can't deal with that guy. He's just going to rap. They found the bronx. I know you've seen that. I saw that fork now and how big the fucking rat work. How many were. They were a mess. They said there's a lot of them. The guy looked at me and goes, he thought it was kids in there. He thought it was like kids. They will fuck. He pulled them out. They were like a cat. The back legs. Cat picks his legs up. He had it like three feet. What was the biggest rat I've ever seen in my life? It was fucking enormous. It's body looked like it was almost two feet long. His body, his body was clearly more than a foot long.

Speaker 6:          01:19:15       His body easily could have been a foot and a half, maybe even two feet long. It was a big rat and this guy said there's a lot of them there. You said there was a lot of them. That whole. You know, it's so weird. Like I, I grew up on Adhd for awhile when I came from Cuba and we would kill rats. You know, you chase her. I hit him with a stick. Light them on fire, throw rocks at you, make sure that motherfucker's dead. Then I used to spend my summers on 140th street. My godmother had three buildings so I could walk underneath. I seen a rat under that one time that his eyes was so fucking big. His eyes are so fucking big that I was like, no, you know where I've seen a big rap too at the La Jolla comedy store. Fucking condo. I've seen a rat in that motherfucker.

Speaker 6:          01:19:54       I packed my bags and got back on that five. Oh yeah, I see the big wrap there. I think they're living in the ocean. God Damn it. I can't deal with that. So fucking durable. They can compress their body and get to really small holes to like a big rat can smush his body and get through a fairly small fucking hall. It's really kind of crazy to watch. That's a fuck is you think guys back in the day, like 400, 500 years ago were afraid of rats or adidas looked at us food like we're lucky that we don't have to deal with the rats, but it just mentally like it. They're afraid and if you go back like neanderthal days they were. They didn't give a fuck about a rat. Anything small digression. I live up in the hills too and I have a privacy fence and you'll see them just running.

Speaker 6:          01:20:36       My dogs would try to it and then I'll jump every time I see one and I'm like, when you get over that dude, I used to have them in my. I had to bring in exterminators. I used to have them by Anik. You would hear them. It was like, like literally like two dogs fighting up there. I would hear like they would screech and squawk at each other sometimes because they would be mating. So I'd hear. I would hear a scream, fuck yeah, in my house. I hear it in my attic. It had hire a guy to come in and kill them all. How? It was nuts, but they weren't that big. They were regular size, but you know they're. They're fucking right. Wanting in your ceiling, running a slamming things and fighting over pussy. They're screaming and fighting over posing. Isn't that weird? I don't know if you were there, how they. A friend of mine called me once, how they would do arson in the old days that we get a cage and put myself and pour gasoline on the mice and the mice on fire and pulled the thing and the mice run into the walls and big. That's the way the your house on fire to do that. Fucking insurance scam and new Rach would go into the walls and burn the wool. That's the way that you do old adage. Brilliant. That's how you do it.

Speaker 6:          01:21:47       As long as he had enough rats right now, fucking places going down because while they're searing, they're still going in your walls dying. So that's starting more fucking things in your walls. I mean, what gasoline be enough? It has a really dip 'em in there and you have to dip them in the old days when everybody was in on it. The fuck. Look at Bushwick. Bill got shot in the fucking head. Did he? You didn't hear about this earlier. Bushwick bill. We were reading a story. It's an old story happened in 99. He told his girlfriend is shoot him in the head because he wanted to get the insurance money and they don't know who did it, whether he shot himself in the head or she shot him in the head, but he got shot in the eye, so as he alive, he's alive because somebody send them in Houston musical.

Speaker 6:          01:22:29       John Westlink Bush would have been a long time. Okay. Oh, it's. I think he's on the cover of one of his fucking. We can't be stopped. I think the Geto boys with the patch over his eye. Where it shows. Is Iowa all fucked up where he shot himself? Yeah, isn't it? Yeah. It's on Wendy albums where he's coming out. Would that be to shoot you? So when you were high on everclear? Apparently everclear is like some super powerful alcohol. First Time I got pulled over, I was on seven shots of everclear and a copy of his 16. Oh Man. I used to hang out. I used to work at this movie theater with all these guys that

Speaker 3:          01:23:06       were like 18 or 19 and know would go to this military base and by everclear. And so, uh, they thought it was cool because they were the ones who first introduced me to weed and everything. I have no military, no, no. These guys that hang out with these older guys and so, uh, I would, they thought it would be funny to like get me fucked up on it by like a Gimme shots and I wanted to act like, oh yeah, I'm cool. I can do shots of this. Not knowing what ever clear was, I just heard it was like a strong alcohol. What is the percentage of alcohol and everclear? I wanted to say it was 127 of them proof. And then they let you drive? Well, no, they, they, uh, thought I was crashing there, but I, I lied to him. It's like he got the fucking car bitch, motherfucker with you when he's dressed us all alleged by the end.

Speaker 3:          01:23:55       The coolest thing was though, is that I got pulled over right down the street, like literally like two blocks. I got pulled over and the cop goes, dude, you're wasted. All right. Here's the deal. See this Udl, which is a like a gas station. He's like, you park your car in there, you sit there. He's like, I want you to go inside by a cup of coffee. I'm coming back and four hours if you're not here, I'm giving you a fucking Dui. I'm going, I know where you are. And everything like that would have been sort of. And really you shouldn't go to jail. He even gets better. He even gets better as I was like, he's like, go in there and get a coffee. And I'm like, actually I have no money. And he goes, he goes and he gave me money to buy a cup of coffee. And then, uh, so I sat down

Speaker 7:          01:24:33       commerce. There's good cops out there, man advaclear in Boulder, Colorado. There's a Mexican restaurant. I don't know if it's still there. It's pupusas. Yo, it's on melrose, melrose, on the whatever. The main pro. You're in boulder. Go to pupusas. Fucking tremendous. But the secret of this place was that Margarita is, were made whatever. Clear. Quantro wow. So you were only allowed and then they asked you to fucking leave and go, fuck that. I ain't Queloz three of those and you just be like this bro.

Speaker 3:          01:25:02       I think El Coyote, they allowed to do that. And last name,

Speaker 7:          01:25:06       green limit three Margarita limit bitch at for lunch. They had a one margarita limits. You could have two little ones. They had little much for a little champagne wedding things he does that.

Speaker 3:          01:25:17       They don't tell you what's in it like that. They win all the Margarita contest, you know that like almost every year and they won't tell you what the secret ingredient is, but every time I go there, if you just get the one on the rocks, I'll get to and I feel like I just fucking did. Ecstasy something.

Speaker 7:          01:25:30       Yeah. We need to film this. We need to film us going to El Coyote and having some. Marguerite is, let's do that. Boys don't drive. You don't want the craziest thing. We're going to hire someone to drive. We'll get a little caught. One of the craziest things I've Tequila. Just kidding. It depends what mood you're in. If you drink enough tequila, bro, it becomes something different. Yes. It becomes a different animal than vodka or Tequila is a kind of tricky mother. I don't know if you motherfuckers ever rate the warm. I made a mistake one second, but swapped and ate a warm Tequila. Makes me, uh, I think, yeah,

Speaker 4:          01:26:04       there's a difference between Tequila draw. It sounds ridiculous. It does, but it's true. And Sheila Drunk whiskey drunk. Whiskey drunk is more like fucking aggressive Tequila. Tequila drunk is more like we've got to find the vampires. Oh, I'm angry. I'm angry on Tequila man. But to Jack Daniels is questionable choice. I mean, you never seen it. Never been. You never seen me angry as a drug dealers. I think a lot of it that you go into. So if you think I'm an angry drunk and it was dangerous and you start drinking because you're weird reaction. I'm not an angry drunk though. I don't believe in that shit entirely. I feel like if you're an angry person and you get drunk, then you become an angry drunk. If you have some fucking resolved issues, then it become an angry drunk because most of the people are not even ready.

Speaker 4:          01:26:52       Sing, angry. I guess. It's just crazy. Like Tequila makes you a fucking like Robin. You're a silly drunk. You become silly when you're drunk because you're a silly person and it's for you. It's you just. Your inhibitions loosen up and you become more like. Like that podcast that we did with burn. You were fucking hammered and you were really funny and one of the reasons why you really funny because you were. You were giggling and silly because you went into lose your inhibitions mode right now. That was Tequila would have had sex with Bert was crazy. Like, well, let's say I drank a beer. I've did blow. I will go home and just want to fuck. But when you do Tequila, do blow, you get old, creepy, really like to put a cape on and you start looking at a chick thinking about maybe she could do a somersault and land on my face.

Speaker 4:          01:27:37       You know, like you just got spirits in it to kill this spirit. Something I get fucking creepy on Tequila. Willing be. Well, it's made out of a plant. You know, there's something in your toes. Really. Yeah. Get it would blow you. Blow the thing. Tequila gets. It becomes a difference. It's such a fine dance though, of having too much Tequila where your Dick don't work. It's like, this is fucking. You got to get just enough so that you're crazy, but you have enough food in you and you've taken your vitamins so you'd. Dick still works because if you're like unhealthy and you get drug off Tequila, good luck with your Dick. Good luck. You just, you just put yourself in a great position. You got your ready for wild, crazy times. Everyone's game. Oh, we'll look at your deck. Also. Sad. Have you ever had from booze guy from booth Redman, from Bulls you've had?

Speaker 4:          01:28:25       You haven't, no, no, but you throw that in the powder. In the old days you dead, it shrinks into the nut sack. That is amazing when you want to fuck. But there ain't nothing there. Nothing there. It's deep, deep, deep in the nut sack and they got to keep sucking and they got a nice Dick. But like they, it starts off like this, like they got hold it fucking bottom of it and then it gets bigger and bigger and then you think about doing a line. It goes back in the cocoon with a fucking nightmare doing that shit. You want to eat that? But then you're like, okay, I'll just eat your pussy like you just fucking all the I had in my mind.

Speaker 1:          01:29:02       Fuck it. I'll just eat your fucking. The most embarrassing ones that I've ever had was when I was drunk and I started the fuck and then as I was fucking, the alcohol really kicked in and then I completely lost my boner so it lost it while I was already having sex. So it's like for the girl, it's like a terrible feeling. I just puked once dude. To have been, have a hard Dick, put it inside you and then in life you don't even keep them interested enough to keep the hard on like, and then it was just pathetic. I just felt like I was trying not to act like you were and then you reach down buyer to almost like a whisper and I turned my head and threw up and tried to like do it like a barf bag where I kinda kept that contained in my back. And then she was like, did you just throw up my computer? Yeah, you tried?

Speaker 7:          01:29:49       Yeah. You ever throw up and you don't give a fuck. You fuck that. Look the other way. I'm still going to give you a stabbing. She don't give a fuck. And that smell is. And you're like, Oh, is that hillary? And they say to me, kiss me. I'll kiss you full shoot this fucking loaded that dead snatch and alcoholic as Audi. Dirty fuck. Because once Johann Johann de, that's what happens is a fucking date written on dumping them. This bitch literally go down. You know we don't condone it, but that's what happens that date. You just got to catch yourself with. The worst is when some chick pukes in your car like language Speaker Grill, and you want to beat the fuck. Fuck. That's the worse. Your car smells like Puke. For 11 months. I was in my car with a toothpick. Picking out each little hole in my speaker grill. Just pulling out red bull.

Speaker 1:          01:30:42       Yeah. Well listen man, I had a girl puke in my car back in the fucking eighties and they didn't have good cleaner.

Speaker 7:          01:30:48       You couldn't clean the car out. They didn't have all that good

Speaker 1:          01:30:50       stuff back then. You basically went and used that shitty ass vacuum would always catch on the carbon go. Remember it would catch on the carpet and you cannot fucking Donald. I go to the carwash. You tried to do the entire car with twenty five cents. It was like the fastest I've ever moved to my town. You would have to go to one of those full service car washes and get done the shampoo your shit, but you don't want to do that because those monkeys, whether shampoo and your shit, they get fucking suds in your wiring and then your fucking car shorts out. You know, I didn't want to do that. I knew those dudes. I worked at a car wash. So when I thought about getting my car washed, I'm like, I'm not going to bring it to these fucking guys. These guy's gonna. They let me drive a porsche.

Speaker 1:          01:31:27       Okay. I didn't even know how to drive a stick. I hadn't zero stick knowledge and I got into fucking Porsche. That's how the first car I ever drove stick was a porsche at a fucking, at a car wash. I don't even know what I was doing when he told me I go, how do I drive it? He goes, just push the clutch in, put, put it in gear and then slowly let your foot off the gas. So I come out of this car washes, 16 year old faced kid driving a porsche, you know? And the guy said, why did you drive it if you didn't know how to do it? I'm like, why? They let me drive it. I didn't have anything to say to him. I'm just

Speaker 8:          01:32:00       like, I'm sorry. They told me to drive it. The Guy told me I would know how to drive stick, stick the thing in gear and it'd be no problem. They didn't give a fuck.

Speaker 7:          01:32:07       I got busted last week washing my car and coin Burbank Boulevard. Brian. There's a little car wash. Then I usually go in there and just hit it. But I had to fucking pee dog. I just had a piece while I was washing the car. Nobody was watching you know me bro. Out per a phone booth. I got a really A. I'll pull over and make believe. Now nobody has phone booths no more. But in the old days I make believe I'm on the phone. Take my pick up. Even as traffic is driving by it, they don't think you're pissing. I'm pissing on the fucking thing. You just can't do it in the window. Can steam comes out there, bust you in the fucking winter? So Damn, washing my car, it's 9:15 in the morning, I gotTa pee bad and I said, fuck, I'm going to take my dick out ready? And I took my dick out. I'm old and I'm watching the car and I just went into this fucking thought and next thing you know, I look over and the owner, the thing was right there. He was like, are you fucking serious? Like a dog? I had to fucking pee and it's going into a total. He was doing me a favor, put the hose down and get the fuck outta here. He drew me the fuck out. He goes, I'll call the fucking police.

Speaker 8:          01:33:04       I watched a guy, I didn't say anything. He told the guy who comes to my house and uh, it's actually what it's called, the poop Butler because I travel it, but he picks up poop basically from your dog for, for my two dogs. And I didn't clarify that. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I know I had, I paid a service. Are you serious? Yeah, it's a service. It's the best thing that I could ever do because. Or I'd have five days of shit to pick up. So my, so he was peeing like a big gold thing and I'm like, is that guy peeing? And he's a little creepy because they think he's always steering into try to see my wife, like walk around or something, who wouldn't? But I look and I see him with now he's got a big gold thing that he just pissed in front of my house.

Speaker 8:          01:33:41       So I'm watching him because he doesn't want to move so I can pull in. I'm like, where's it gonna throw that. If he throws that into my bushes, I'm going to be pissed. Watch to my neighbors and just acts like he's, you know, takes the big gulp, throws his piss onto my neighbor's yard and then leave. That just happened. I. So now I'm like, well, it's such a good service and there's no other competition. So if I, if I call and say, hey, tell them not to throw piss on my neighbor's yard, that then what happens? And I got to pick up poop. So it was a weird sacrifice. I'm well, is this a company where the guy that owns the company or is this an employee? Hold on, hold on. The p thing is just one thing. This looking at your wife, you just glossed over.

Speaker 8:          01:34:21       Why don't you tell us a little bit more? What is. What is the reason for that? Well, we don't. Well, because if you stare at and he comes early in the morning, you can get a glimpse at 9:00 AM of maybe her popping up. Like why? Why are you saying that? Did he do that? We, she gets that feeling that he is, but we've never actually caught. She's like, I think he stares. I think he, you know, my wife doesn't sound like that once she. Why does she think stairs? No evidence. Just a guess. Just thinking in that you'll see him walk by. So she's like, was he just stay? You don't, we don't know. We should maybe just videotape it. Wants to set up a camera and see if he hangs out or if he pisses in my backyard yard. My whole house has cameras. I

Speaker 1:          01:34:58       am alerted whenever somebody enters each one of my rooms on my iphone, somebody crazy bitches, bro. You to keep your shit locked out and black wizards attack me. Be careful. Black was it the guy robbed him, put a fake ones, fake beard on like a wizard and he had a hood on. It was like a black wizard say did he fucking made magic and made your money disappeared of my flat flashback when I'm at JC penny's and I see a black Santa Claus at the mall or something.

I mean I've seen one on TV. Oh No. I've seen in real life there was black Santa clauses. There was William Northland Mall where, which mostly blacks. I think that's why that has kind of suck for being a black kid.

Speaker 1:          01:35:43       I told you that when went to to a planet of the apes in an all black movie theater in Philly that I really started thinking about what it must be like to have every fucking movie that they were preview was all these white people, white people, white people, white people, White. Everything is white problem, white movie, White Silliness, and I'm like, wow, let's say you gotta be fucking weird as Shit, man. The only superhero he got was blade fucker for a couple of years. It really was that movies back to the boat. First will be is there's a lot of black comics who dress up like chicks. Like that's the one part. Like why that so, so funny. Yeah. You know Chappelle talk about that. Yeah. Dave Chappelle had like a. He was on like one of those shows like inside the actor's studio, we just like what?

Speaker 1:          01:36:28       What is it that when a black man becomes really famous, they want to make them dress as a woman and they showed. They showed all these pictures of Richard Pryor doing it and all these different comics doing it all throughout history. Martin Lawrence doing it, Jamie Foxx doing it and like, wow. Yeah, that is weird. Why do all these prayer is what? What is that? Why? Why is it like. Was it flip Wilson the first flip bullshit. Fuck. Is that about. What does that. That funny though. I know it's, to me it's got to be like the ultimate, like a black man trying to be as like an aggressive towards women as possible. What's the most, the most unimpressive thing you can be is be a woman. Dress up like a woman. Oh God. What you talking about? Like that's not a guy trying to get some pussy.

Speaker 1:          01:37:16       It's like the complete polar opposite of what white people are afraid of in a black guy. Well, white people are afraid of in a black guy is a fucking big muscular black man with a giant Black Dick. Some big football player, Nfl Stud athlete that wants to fuck your woman. So what is the polar opposite of that? What's a black man being all silly and address dressing like a woman? Well, he's not even trying to get some, get any pussy. Look at him because he had lipstick on and makeup and shit. He makes me relax, you know? He's like, well, what'd you say? That's not a black eye trying to get laid at all. I think that's what it is. I think that's what it is. I'm going to check. It's white. People are of black dicks

Speaker 6:          01:37:56       so forces these black people to try it. A little bit of a black planet bitches. That's right. I get one point. If it's a black dude, I just can't. What's wrong with you? Because he doesn't have a black dick and somebody can get into the fantasy. It's nothing about me being raised. This is. I think it's gay. If you watch a black guy fucking a white chick if you're a white guy because. Because now you can't even pretend that to you. See, if you're a white guy, you can pretend that your desk, you could beat off and watch a girl give head and pretend that she's given you 10 shit. Man, I can't. I'm not. I know I'm looking at a laptop. What I like to see though is like a fucking black check. Like really a black chick or black dude really pounding a little white chick.

Speaker 6:          01:38:35       I think that's because you know it's not fake. That's what you want. No, no. Because you know deep. You want that power. You know what that dominant do you want him to see a real fucking hard fucking. You don't want to see if making love. Okay, burn. I love listening. I was just trying to make a joke. Dude. I don't really believe that there's something gay about watching black dicks. I was trying to go in a little comedy rap videos. So if you want to go on with your little freak shit and talking about like watching a girl get fucked in a way that you're not capable of and that's what really turns you on. Or you go for it buddy. You're like legit trying to take. I do like bulge of. What the fuck is that about? Getting head pretend to get my dick sucked.

Speaker 6:          01:39:09       You can print. You liked the whole thing of look, I listened. Some girls are good at sucking Nixon. It's awesome. I like to see a woman snack for a little while, but I really liked the art of seeing the chick suck a dick. I'm going to be honest. Why do. Why is it shocking? Let me explain something to you. Ah, yeah. You print a tenants your Dick. That's why you don't want to watch black ones. I was in county jail and I've never looked at a black cock. No. Do I want to see one? When I popped on that Kim Kardashian and tape and I seem a little odd. Jay's fucking Dick. Stop. I turned that mother fuck off. Understand me and I remember telling my buddy, I'm not fucking. He was like, you're prejudice, prejudice a black Dick. I'm just prejudice a dick. That black one was like fucking jaws.

Speaker 6:          01:39:48       It didn't stop fucking stop, but even had the jaws music. I thought that that was the worst thing I ever seen him. Like I looked at that tape to see how hot she was and I hit it off from the fear like I had flunked. It was his dick harass her. Awesome. She got fucked. She got. I only watched it, but what she goes, I want to come again as you sweat and I'm like, this is a fucking pig. This chick is a fucking amazing how far she's come with that and we don't give a fuck. I shit got fucked really hard. People loved it. You got it. It will. It has to be accidental. You can't put it out yourself. You can't make a video and go hears me fucking because no porn star is ever reached the status of Kim Kardashian. She's done is accidentally have it and put it out and that's why she's about to start making God. But that's, that's how she got 50 million already. She got, she got into a back door. She did something amazing guys, but she did something amazing. Can we pay for porn? We paid the see a black guy fucking a white chick chick, black guy.

Speaker 7:          01:40:54       She fucked that mother fucker out of clear love or whatever the fuck it was. Oh, she fucked his brains out. It wasn't like pulling. That's why it shocked [inaudible] right? Boys and girls, it was like, you know when you do pull, you show up at one. This gave us something different and dog, whatever the gave gave us. I told Joe, you know, we wake up in the morning where like, where are we doing a set plan that bitch wakes up and says, how am I gonna? How am I going to be the number one trending topic on yahoo and Google and if you look at Google and Yahoo, she's number one three days a fucking week. I don't know what the fuck she does, but she's a genius. Whatever she did because she can't. She's a genius. Attention whore. Yeah. She. What she is is the Michael Jordan of attention horse

Speaker 3:          01:41:40       and now she's dating a super tall guy with probably the biggest dick.

Speaker 7:          01:41:44       Oh. And he's worthless. That sees that fucking monster alive. Then they just told her the other day that she was married before he. He's like, really? Shoot that fucking Momma thinks he's the first one that fucked up. You don't know that she's been swallowing pickup and fucking calabasas. She was 15. Well, he's probably just excited to be with someone famous public guy. What does he do? He plays basketball.

Speaker 3:          01:42:06       He looks like he plays basketball so you play huge and like his dick was just like curl up in her. But like a snail or something,

Speaker 6:          01:42:13       movies focused on, you know, they let that a max hardcore guy out of jail. Speaking of like levels of shit if you don't know who he is. He's a guy who got arrested in Florida because Florida has some crazy laws were like if you ship things to their car, they have like very strict ideas of what's offensive and what is uh, what's the, what's the word? Obscenity, you know. And this is what the guy was arrested for because the porn was obscene. He's got some hardcore shit where he pisses and girl's ass holes, holes their asshole open sticks a straw in it and makes them drink the piss out of their asshole. Yeah, I mean he goes deep for that fucking giving me me want to Luci who? What's that crazy guy that my buddy sent me a link and that like I thought it was okay.

Speaker 7:          01:42:59       Joe, who's the Italian guy to fuck bitches. That's my. Goes about Kupong. Fuck that shit. You let her keep her ass. He fucking fuck him. And he asked to make some fucking suck his dick while they're eating a slice of pizza. That's gangster right there. He's one of the first to fucking life from the seventies. He's been. He's got sideburns and one video I seen that says drop it out. That said something

Speaker 6:          01:43:28       gay about being into a male porn star. Like what do you got? What's the recent Rocco? So Freddy elected with that guy fucks something. Something. There's something real weird about like being a fan of an actual break. I've depor and trying to deepen my life a little bit. Really keep trying to cut it back. Only because it just you as a comic, you go back and you watch it. My brain now I watched 30 and then that damn

Speaker 7:          01:43:52       search. I'll go wonder if there's Asian girls with black socks who work at starbucks. Click, click, Bam. Oh look at that. Oh, I wonder if they. And then you just find yourself. How many did I watch? I watch at maybe 10, 15 second increments and the my brain moves onto the next thing, some done a porn add. I'm done for a little bit, for a little bit and people write comments about porn and then in urban environments I've ever been spanked or any requirements about porn when he's talking about on the process and it'll have comments about the porn and I just get pissed at the people going, oh, I would, I would fuck away better than this guy. Her face is a bit. Just be happier watching porn. Like people are so desensitized now. Upset. Yeah. Yeah. I get mad at the kids are born at all.

Speaker 7:          01:44:37       You only saw that I've been on is the one my buddy linked me to for the Kim Kardashian because I looked on my own and couldn't find that on my credit card. And I would tell Brian and Brian's like, I got freedom. I don't know about the computer. And I'd been on Youporn youporn. You know, I've told it a thousand times the chicks of filthy, but you know, they, they, they have dirty feet and they suck Dick and all that dumb shit. But tell you what, the fucking pisses me off by you for that. They live. You don't like hot Asian chicken. It's a fucking Mexicans don't get your nationality straight. That fucking pisses fuck around with you. I'm in the mood to see a nice little Chinky will show that little fucking hairy monkey. And they show a Mexican from fucking no central. Sure. It's a Mexican bitch.

Speaker 7:          01:45:14       Nah, the Thai ones are Brown. I got those brown little men, maybe Indian, Asian and he's a fucking real dark. Like those Asian media, right? They have like the edge of roast beef, like it's really dark and it could be yellow, like the skin is like a beige, but they're fucking noodles. Nipples. That doesn't bother you. A dark doesn't bother you, does it? No, I like that. You scratch got the little light soy sauce that comes to the green container. Not The red one. Less sodium. You know what I'm saying? I like a chick at either thing I did a couple of weeks ago. Shoot guys, this Asian was so fucking hot, but she had that soy sauce thing going that she was real Chinese from San Francisco. His speech was bad and I could tell she was a dirty freak. I just couldn't tell. I could just smell it. Look at her. I could tell. Yeah, you could just tell she was flirty. You could just tell. She sat one time and I could see her phone. Once I see that done, that's it. I can tell they're filthy animals. That's just a. You could close them, but I ain't got nothing to offer. I got nothing. She's 22. Am I going to give her drama? I can't deal with that shit. You need big victim shit. Shit. Take my hand. And Mr.

Speaker 7:          01:46:24       John heffrons stealing bitches out there out in the wild. So to hear about the UFC. They just made Alistair overeem versus Brock Lesnar December 30th at the mgm in Vegas at a five round fight. He's not going to show up when you talk crazy. You're not be Talkin Shit. Why are they showing up? Why do you say he's not showing that? The berkey locis is making a comeback. If diverticulitis, he had surgery. Apparently they think that sees cured one percent. They

Speaker 6:          01:46:50       fixed it because the the area that he kept having a reoccurring diverticulitis area, they just cut that area out and you know, they think he's 100 percent, but they left the central nervous system and it's still fucking reflecting. The shots came, gave him fill the fucking head. It's still spreads those testicles out of body and that gives them the diverticulitis all over again. Diverticulitis, whatever the fuck it is, it doesn't matter. We'll make some guys got balls if he. He just, he think about what he's done just to go from pro wrestling with no striking experience whatsoever. Enter into mixed martial arts right into the thick and the game. First fucking fight in the UFC. Takes on Frank Mir who a former UFC heavyweight champion gets knee barred. You know, second fight I believe you took on Randy Coture, right? Who is it? No, Keith haring that he took on Randy coture.

Speaker 6:          01:47:36       I mean, dude, but brock Lesnar is a bad mother fucker can help. We might not be able to beat Cain Velasquez, but brock Lesnar is a bad motherfucker. Beat heath heights, whatever his name is. He's herring out of the business. Well, that's not necessarily what he's hearing. He had a lot of fights, man. Yeah, but you had a lot of. Yeah, but he was at a crossroads in his own life. Nothing bad. I'm just saying we went to that fight. You're right there. When he punched him, he did the fucking somersault. Yeah. I just think it's a little disrespectful. People say that before that retired heath herring routine. He's hiring retired three retired. He was. I talked to heath herring recently. He's in fine shape. I saw him in Vegas. He's not. There's nothing wrong with him. Like you look in his eyes. He's 100 percent there.

Speaker 6:          01:48:15       He looks good. He looks healthy. You know he's had some tough fights and they fought cro. Cop and he fought fade or any fun Noguera he did. He did. He fight fader. Can I just make that up and I believe he fought fader. I may look it up, I don't know, I forget he just never fought a guy, but I think he started doing a bunch of other stuff. It's hard, man. Those for, for guys who aren't a name, it's fucking hard, you know, it's hard to make real money, you know, because you got to be putting asses in the seats so it's, you know, you got to beat someone big and when it came to beating the big guys, he came real close with Nogueira and his UFC fight. He fucking head kicked him and dropped him. No girl look done and he turned, didn't finish him off.

Speaker 6:          01:48:55       He had a chance, but he didn't finish them on as a reason for that dope. No Garrett's toughest fucked. But he was hurt. Keith haring a left. Oh, was he the first fight in the UFC was going Jayco Brian? Yes. When he was hurt, he had a depot Garrett. Right. He knocked him down and he didn't know Jacob. Brian out wrestled them and he just had a really fucked up knee and he came up to me and talk to me about it afterwards because he was like, you know, hey, listen to commentary. You always very supportive, but what the fuck? I was like, dude, you got to watch the fight. I mean you just took you down at will and it's like my knee was torn. I had to take the fight and he just decided to just fucking be a tough guy and fight anyway and he thought he could win. He's like, I can catch this guy, and he just couldn't. Couldn't get it going man. Having a knee tear and then trying to fight a guy like Jacob Brian, a fucking professional mixed martial arts fighter in the UFC. She has Jacob. Brian, I'll buy a man. A boy, a boy. A Matt Hughes Against Josh Koscheck. Is it signed?

Speaker 1:          01:49:49       It's signed. It's on wikipedia was. Well, I know that. I'll find out for cute look we're telling him, but I think I saw linkedin said they're waiting. They're waiting to go. It was just cool with everybody. Fucking creepy fight for, for use because it's a totally different kind of trained for Diego. Sanchez is not nearly as dangerous on the feet as cost check is at least theoretically because Diego Sanchez will swore on motherfucker. He can be very dangerous on his feet, but the idea was that diego would not be able to out wrestle. Matt. Matt's a big welterweight dig. It was a fairly small welterweight and also encaustic steps in who's a really fucking good wrestler and is a big welterweight and has been thinking about fighting at one 85 and was actually campaigning to try to fight in the San Jose UFC in November. So here you got a guy who's a, a guy who can fight it, one 85.

Speaker 1:          01:50:34       He's big. You know Diego can't fight it. One 85. I mean he did. He did on the ultimate fighter, but I mean competitively in the UFC he's this physical frame in my opinion is too small. He could do it and you can beat a lot of guys just by hustling them and outworking him, but his best way is probably like one slash 65. But Josh Koscheck and carry one 85. He's a strong character. He's got, you know, he's got a good frame. He's a tough dude. He's a serious fucking wrestler and you know, and he's dangerous on his feet. Man, he's got big power in that right hand. So it's a totally different fight for Matt Hughes with three weeks notice. What do you think the shelf life, a shelf life is getting smaller, smaller from a fighter, like where you have five, let's say from the time you start sprinting, I, you get a big fight and then why you're taking him a lot.

Speaker 1:          01:51:20       He's getting smaller or will eventually be lasts longer. What are you talking about? The shelf life of? Do you mean how many fights you can have? Yeah, before you start to deteriorate. Yeah. Yeah. It depends on your style. You know, some guy, the other guys go with that really good. Three year run and then physically something has gotten like machita. Here's a perfect example. Garlic machida takes very little damage. So garlic machita, he'll run for longer than a garlic vander. And who's got this wild attacking style? You know, and it's maybe not vandalize a bad motherfucker, you know what I mean? Vandelay has been stopped a few times now, but it's because of annually style randomly played it safe. You know, you saw like in the Michael bisping fight, he's still there. You know what I mean? Maybe his chin isn't as good as it was back in the day, but the truth is that back in the day he got dropped a bunch of times too.

Speaker 1:          01:52:06       He would come and wild and reckless. Dan Henderson dropped them. A lot of people dropped him before Dan Henderson knocked him out and their second fight, Dan Henderson dropped him and had him fucked up in their first fight. He closed his eye. His eye was like one big giant fucking baboons. Vagina. It was, it was bad man. So vandelay has always been in there with guys that uh, you know, that have put them in danger, uh, dropped him or heard him. Mark Hunt dropped him. But when he got in there against real good strikers, that's when he had real problems. That's why cro cop fucked him up. If you go back to watch that fight in pride, man, he, he beat cro cop in their first fight, or maybe it was a draw I think because they had weird rules like if you only go to the ground for like 30, but

Speaker 6:          01:52:46       vandelay took a lot of hard fucking kicks to the body. That was when cro cop was in his prime cro. Cop didn't have a, a sprawl yet though he wasn't confident enough with his take down defense to have a full mma fight, but by the time they fought, the second time man that was cro cop in his prime, that was the heavyweight Grand Prix and he fucking head kicked vandelay into another universe. Man. That was when cro cop was the best. So vandelay without wild styles always had a problem with guys like that. You know, bro, I mean, but he's awesome though. Talking about fighters here, you're as much of a fan of his. Even more than I am. Vandelay fighting carried. Yeah. Find my huge vandelay fan. Longevity now is what you make. Look at the guidance. Joe Rogan turned me onto that. I met, I had the honor of meeting and talking to him and he just fought a fight. Bernard Hopkins fought the fight of his fucking life and he fought it and it was customed to him. I'm 46, Bro.

Speaker 1:          01:53:42       I'm not going to get into a band with no body, but I'm going to throw punches, get the fuck out of there. I'm like, well, actually, this, this fight was very different than the first fight. This fight. He actually got in and mixed it up with this guy and he took it out of his game.

Speaker 6:          01:53:55       You know, whatever they do, it's what they take care of, how smart they are. GSP is fucking genius. He takes care of himself at all.

Speaker 1:          01:54:02       Well, you know what he is, he's honest, he's honest, he's honest about what's at risk. There's a lot of guys who aren't honest about what's at risk, you know, and that's one of the things why he says he won't fight a friend. You know, he talked about it, that I could do this if on top of them and I see an elbow again, I deliver it and give cerebral damage. You know he's, but he's right. He feels he knows what the fuck he's doing because he's had it done to him. Man. When Matt Serra mounted him and was dropping bombs on them and Matt, Sarah can fucking punch. Let me tell you something. That little guineas got bricks in it. He's got bricks in his gloves. I never seen anybody that Matt Serra didn't. He punched clean that didn't get put on Queer Street. He hit fucking hard, you know.

Speaker 1:          01:54:39       So when he clipped George in that fight, you could tell George was like, oh shit. Like he, he can tell his functioning, drop, like he knows what it's like to get really clipped and you know, he doesn't want that to happen. And he's a very fucking smart dude. He's completely honest and aware about the entire game. That's one of the reasons why he's so good. He'll tell you exactly how he feels. I am nervous. This is a very important fight for me. This a fucking champ, one of the best pound for pound fighters in the world and he's nervous and he's talking about being nervous. Then he gets in there and just fucking shines, gets in there and just

Speaker 6:          01:55:13       lights. You both know and you and you. The day you stop getting nervous before you go on stage is the day you just go home.

Speaker 1:          01:55:22       No. The worst thing you do with George St Pierre Man is talk some shit to Bj Penn when Bj was talking about that shit man. You could see the determination grow and George's eyes and George is a disciplined motherfucker and one of the things about guys that are truly, truly disciplined and really in amazing condition like, like Nick Diaz as well, is that these guys know that they can push a pace that most people will drown under so they'll fucking force it because they know you might be talented, you might be talented, but maybe you didn't get up early enough. Maybe you didn't sleep enough. Maybe you didn't eat the right foods. Maybe you didn't take the right vitamins. Maybe you didn't fucking put in 100 percent and stack your training correctly and have a professional, a physical trainer working with you, monitoring your heartbeat will. George does or he knows he can run you out into the middle of the fucking ocean bitch, and that's what he did with Bj man.

Speaker 1:          01:56:12       He just put him in, put him in a position where he forced them to work real hard from the beginning, tired his muscles out and started taking him down and beating the fuck out of them and the way he did it was genius man, and the way he did it was fueled by that determination that was brought on by that shit talking. I thought he'd did it. The fucking Katya. Katya kind of wore a monocle for a fucking year and he might don't walk in that room with a fucking Monaco. He check out of that with the Jack the fuck. Not Ten Times 30 times. If I fucked it up, I'm going to keep punching because I'm going to fuck it up again. Every time you look in the mirror and blink motherfucking comes under GSP, a simple. I went to this thing the more to professional Moitai league MLP or MPL and it was in Long Beach last weekend and I got to see really high level kickboxing like live in person as a fucking rare man.

Speaker 1:          01:57:02       It's rare that you get a card like this bull, a cow bull count, a tie guy with a 198 victories. He's not even 3,198 victories find every other week. Oh, he's in Thailand, man. They fight them young. They fight them when they're little teenagers. 13 and 14, 15 sec documents. The only guy, I think he's a less than 20 losses and 198 fucking victories and he let this dude up. Apparently this dude was from Canada I believe, and he was talking all kinds of shit and pushed them at the weigh ins and the ties are very respectful, like they don't do that kind of shit. They they like, they have this dance. They do rather why crew in the middle of the ring before and they did all this too. They played the music and these guys did their dance and they went through their thing, but when, when fucking, when Booyah cow did it, he was doing his dance to the guy like got like right in the guy's face.

Speaker 1:          01:57:51       Does that pushed him at the weigh ins? It was bad ass man. He was like a, it was like a movie fight. Like he got in the guy's face and was doing like pooling arrows and stomping on the ground and doing his little dance and the dude didn't know whether he should give grounds. And the dude was like backed up in the corner while blue car was standing in front of him doing this little dance and then the fight started and dude came out strong. He came out trying to blast but bookout 198 fights. He's so calm and I need you start chopping with those kicks and you feel the fucking leg kick over. And we were in the front row and you could just feel that. Think of that fucking shit. Oh, and you could slowly see his legs starting to give out. And then he was going high with them and just beating his ass, flying Needham Front kicked him, finally front kicked him and knocked him down and the referee said, that's enough. That's enough. The referees saved them because let me tell you something, they hit boycott

Speaker 6:          01:58:42       was just starting to break the guy down. They were in the fourth round and the guy was just starting to stumble and fall apart. And he kept hitting those fucking lazy, whack, whack, whack, whack. It was crazy to watch live, man. It's awesome. And you see that level of stand up and it's like the difference between cost check and George St Pierre in that fight. Cash check is a very. He's a very good athlete. He's got power and his punches, if he hits you, you're really fucked. But in, at least in competition, he has never shown to be a really technical striker. You know, he's been caught by Paulo, Tiago. He's a very tough guy, but you know, don't get me wrong, but he's not like a guy like blue cow. You know, there's a certain level of striking where a guy gets to where they're like always safe and they're just lighten you up.

Speaker 6:          01:59:27       They find your timing. It's like when Anderson did the Chanel Okami, he finds your timing and then he safe man, you're in a fistfight and he's not. How about that? How about you're just a fucking target and he's standing right in front of you and bang, Bang, just firing off on, you know, and when you see that happen man, and you see a guy figured out another guy's timing like that, man, that's, that's a, that's a wild shit to see. And there's guys that can do that to George. There's guys the strikers that could do that to George and a straight kickboxing match, but just can only do it when they find out that takedown. No, they can't. They get scared of that takedown and then they can't pull the trigger. And that's what happens because George hits you with that power double that comes straight from fucking Mars.

Speaker 6:          02:00:07       He pushes off that ground and covers distance in a way. You can't believe this guy can move that fast. For a white dude. How is this dude moving? So fucking fast. Fucking girl. Have a baby. Just let them move back just a little more. Just Bro. Just stay back there dude. Do your little gymnastics in your mind. So is that boy gets released. I want your rather tackle that we'd take down. Oh Guy like GSP. You could probably do that. And back then. Coverage. No coverage. Just leave them for now. For today. We're going to next year and watch what he fucking does. Then full. You ever see him jump those hurdles, but I was watching them on Google this morning doing gymnastics. I'm tempted to go a look place on Vermont. Enjoy it for the month and walk on my hands like a mobile. That's how good that gymnastics shit is for you.

Speaker 6:          02:00:56       And he's taking it. He's so smart. Dude. Georgia. So openminded you know he's so he'll, he'll, he'll try ballet. If someone tells them valley and make them a better. I am to do ballet. Fucking step in there. The rest with your belay. It doesn't give a fuck. He will fucking do it, man. He, he's, he's got an open mind. Me, he actually asked me to teach them some shit, you know, to go to the commentator of the UFC and so you know, this, show me how to do it. That's the most people would just go, what the fuck? You're the talker guy. You do the talking now. But Doug did when I taught him how to throw the spinning back kick correctly when we're training, so it's completely openminded has no ego. It just wants to learn. Just on our level. When you talk to other comics and you always have like a new guy go, do you have any advice and you to tell them, you go,

Speaker 1:          02:01:40       oh yeah, no, no, I don't do that. I don't know what's your. And and you go, really? Really? Yeah. Yeah. Got it off. I'll listen to anybody. Man. Louis C, k came up to me once after one of my sons and gave me all these notes that he wrote down while I was on set. I'm like, this is the fucking coolest thing ever. I had a King Kong bed. He was like, what of King Kong on a wife, a wife, and he's given me ideas. I was just thinking this while you're up there like, fuck yeah man, give me advice. We you, you accept tags. I've seen you. We like all the time. All the time people come up to you and say, Hey John, I love that bit. Have you ever thought about this? And you're like, oh yeah. It's funny how many guys don't do.

Speaker 1:          02:02:11       I mean, I'll even take. I had some guy wants him to go. You talk too fast during this particular thing, just slow down and people. And then the very next show, slow down, got laughs. You're like, oh shit. I didn't even see it from that point of view. Dude. Taglines are a gift. You know, when a friend gives you a tagline, like, like, here's the tagline that Kevin James wrote for me when, uh, you know why I was doing that? Anna Nicole Smith bit where like, it's time Kevin James wrote for Rim job. Kevin James wrote that because I was already like, looked at ask. You don't get that. Oh, he's had this bit about him dying, you know, about Anna Nicole Smith's husband forced her and Kevin and I were just riffing on it and Kevin came up with it's time for a real job and I became like one of the big punchlines in there and I would say it and it was cool because I would say it on stage.

Speaker 1:          02:02:56       I would think of him like, oh my friend hooked me up with a good solid laughing here because a lot of times you do this not to the same bit, but you're just so close to it that you don't see it from that little bit of an angular. So you're, you're taking. It's right there. If we're both going to write a joke about anything, whether we were both going to write a joke about coffee, you would come from one place and I would come from another. Even though we're both comics and we both would see like some obvious points, you know, like, like there was a joke that I did that I found out that Ellen Degeneres had done a joke just like it years before. And I had never seen Elon do it, but the premise is really obvious. And the premise was about penguins being monogamous and the premises, while they both look the same, they all look the same.

Speaker 1:          02:03:35       Like what's the, what's the big deal about them being monogamous? But that's something that anybody would see if you're looking for the point, you know, you're looking for like comedy in, in, in like a, an obvious sort of a situation like penguins been monogamous, you know, you were probably come up with the exact same thing. If I said write a bit about penguins being monogamous, you would probably be like, well what's the big deal? They look exactly the same. You instantly go to it. Ninety percent of comedians would instantly go to that, you know, but it's like your take from there on, once you get that, then it's going to be like, some people go, like Duncan would get real weird with it. He would find some fucking weird spiritual angle. And will they say in the Bhagavad Gita? And he would be like coming out and you would have a different. And it's funny, I have a different angle. When somebody gives you a tag it, it feels like somebody sometimes just give you a $500 bill, like sometimes you have the same, like that's the date you, if you couldn't have wrapped gift or bought something on Amazon that would do the same feeling. I had a friend, Brian Frazier, who, uh, at the time was a, he needed some money and I was making a lot of money and he had

Speaker 6:          02:04:38       a heckler line and I like, dude, this is the greatest fucking Heco line. Every goes, oh, Salazia. So he sold it to me for 500 bucks. This is the, this is the heckler line, because I never used it. But because it felt weird, but this is that he said, because this is what happened when God made you. Oh, and just a dash of content.

Speaker 8:          02:04:53       Oh No. The cop pull off the top, fell off too much, gets great line. I just had this past week, it was just, I was trying to think of situations back in the day when guys were preparing for battle, but their wives were still in their brain because I was trying to go ladies, every once a while your guy gets a look on his face, just leave him alone. He's trying to and I act like I was a guy sharpening my sword and did the hand thing. Like the wife was right in there. A kamiko you should have her bitch about. Really you can leave a shield right on the table like Paul. That's all for today and then the very next show did it, but it adds a whole different spin to your act when you get that little fun. Thanks for the layup though. Yes. Yeah, yeah. Thanks for the insight. Sometimes that turns it into a bigger bit that turns it into something you weren't even thinking.

Speaker 6:          02:05:39       What's really funny how some comics will take attack, like I'll take the tag from somebody. I definitely trust it. Somebody gave me a tag once and it was fucking stolen. Adab spinning the guy's fucking face. Fucking careful. What time I like when a comic comes up and sees me, it gives me a different angle and and years ago I remember watching Chris rock the one special and it was pretty funny and then he had the second one that I remember seeing him at the store on a Monday and he had jenny and the Apollo with them. I didn't know what the fuck they were doing. They were just talking and then the next night it was at the Improv and then he is Louis, cK, and Apollo. And what he was doing was he would get this advanced or major beyond. Give everybody a taste and go during the week.

Speaker 6:          02:06:22       I Want Jenny to Paolo and you, you guys each come up with 15. I'll do 15. We got a party. You know what? I'm getting 200 grand. I give everybody 50. I keep 50 for an events. I got to fucking pilot. I get the best of what they had and gather perspectives on styles of doing the punch and you could see the difference in the specials. You could see the difference in the specials as early specials in the ones. Later on, you could see the Paolo, you could see the precision of Richard. Jenny. You could see the wackiness of Louis C, k. let me tell you something. Not a lot of fucking comics could do that because of their ego. Couldn't do that. A lot of comments. Well, there's also comics that want their standup though to be from their own. Like Louis, c, k. no, no, I, uh, I could see doing that way, man. Look, if you have to do an hour, there's nothing wrong with hiring a bunch of people for writers and coming up with some good material and there's nothing wrong with that. As long as it fits your sense of like minded. Yeah, it doesn't. I never like. Let's think about like Chris Rock, Chris Rock's not really that good because he had guys writing for him, which is ridiculous because he's one of the greatest of all time. Unquestionably. Unquestionably one of the greatest of all time.

Speaker 8:          02:07:25       And the stronger voice you have, the more you can have other people are. I mean, looking at any of the, the uh, blue collar guys, but it's funny how teams of guys that kind of fill those, those models, you can

Speaker 6:          02:07:36       take credit. My point is you can take credit for your own work, but to think that somehow or another your work is better because you come up with a completely on your own as opposed to someone who hired a bunch of writers is kind of silly, right? I mean he's just trying to get a different point of view and perspective, but ultimately it's coming out of his mouth. It's going to be his voice and he, he assigned those writers to help him with this. You know, it's just different. Especially if you have, if you're the type of actor who's gotTa create a crank out a just a. You don't have to, you can't do an 80 percent fun job. It has to be out of the park every time. And if you do that once a year, here's where it would suck though. Where it would suck is if everybody got an equal say in what you said on stage.

Speaker 6:          02:08:13       See if you were a team, say if you were a band and it was the three of us and we had to construct a set and then maybe Joe Diaz wants to put some shit in the beginning. Oh No, no, no, don't do that. You got to the end that we're going to put my shit here, and then you're like, why would I put it? Look Bro, I don't have confidence in that. What the fuck? And then you would argue over how the material gets delivered as long as Joe Diaz was in charge of you went out and hired a bunch of stuff, they brought you things and you're like, okay, this is good. That's good. I feel comfortable. This is. I would say this and I'll put my own flavor into this, my own spin on that. As long as you. It comes from a singular voice.

Speaker 6:          02:08:45       Sure, sure, sure. Absolutely. Yeah. You guys are just enlightened me. I built around you for 10 years. You might. You know what I'm saying? Your best friends that you get open mic with. Some of them are writers now, some of them, but Chris Mcguire, some of them fucking came up to you a couple of times and said something. You're like, this motherfucker militiaman yeah, yeah. Sometimes it's better just to settle down and take and you might not use it, but he might open up a door for you where your voice fits. Yeah, and that's what I'm saying. Sometimes you have to learn how to, you know, collaboration is a very important thing. It's a very interesting thing, but no, I mean that's. These podcasts are essentially 100 percent collaboration. The little rants sweet. Go on little rants things come out of them and stuff like that.

Speaker 6:          02:09:26       That wasn't normal. Exactly. When you're talking about nervous, I do. You get randomly, I get nervous in the craziest things. What you'll be doing a television shows zero nerve and then it's second show Saturday. For some reason my heart, I feel like it's pounding out of the chest really. And then a Friday first show, no nerves. I do a little bit of rituals, estate, state kind of focus to get me in like a really good mood. So when I get on stage, I'm not phoning it in, but as far as physical like I need to wear one of those, a body bugs, I would like to split those up to get those things. Now you can do your heart rate, calories and stuff and you hook it up to your computer real. You wear it for like all week and it gives you. Is it. Does it work while you're exercising?

Speaker 6:          02:10:05       Because one, I was stupid. It goes around your waist in snow. They have new ones that go on your bio that are supposed to be really good and you could fully exercise. Like I got punched the bag and shit with that. Yeah, it's, it's like A. Yeah. Yeah. I like to wear one just to see what my heart rate does before shows and see what kind of calories you burn. Do you ever look at it while you're looking at pictures that no, I want to do it. That was a goddamn good line. Joey talked right over on the stock. I liked it, but it wasn't. What was it said? Do you ever look at that while you're looking at pictures of caulk and see what your heart rate does? It's all right man. Don't worry about USB on a horse

Speaker 8:          02:10:37       I guess. Yeah, I guess you can use it. Seeing it with you're watching porn. Just gymnastics. Horse is not even a real horse behind me.

Speaker 6:          02:10:49       I look at things and look at when there was a time when the store became second nature to me. Joe would call me and go, you go on up before me and there was like a fucking store and I would go down there and I wouldn't feel anything. I would go up on stage and literally fucking bomb bomb bomb and getting my car didn't give a fuck. And then it's times when the audience I feed off the energy. It's like one them to the ocean near that you're sitting in, these waves are hitting you but there's some shit coming at you and sometimes you get to a show and I got to see the audience, like seeing the audience and let me know these motherfuckers paid. They get in and gets me fucking on fire and just get. I see people on the plane sometimes I'll psych myself up.

Speaker 6:          02:11:30       Now I'm throwing different point. Like now I want to go out there and die on stage. We were in Milwaukee. Let me just tell you ever had a heart attack on stage. I'm ready. But if I do it, I'm doing it because I like what's going on right now with comedy and my wife and with us when we go out and if I'm not nervous bro, it ain't going to be real. I don't want it to fuck around no more. I want to be nervous to the point where my palm sweat a little bit. I get that way and then the second year and I check about leaving the door like where's that door? Maybe I don't want to do this. We were in Milwaukee. The place is packed where this fucking awesome theater and joey is in the bag and Joe, he looks out and he sees all the people in the audience. You got this like fucking murderers look in your eye at all. These mother fuckers, Joe Rogan. He goes to, these motherfuckers are going crazy, and then he goes, we're taking this to the next level with taking this to the next level. Joe Rogan, and he'd just had his murderers look in his eyes and went out and just smashed it, but it's like the excitement of the crowd all come in there

Speaker 8:          02:12:25       Somac battery than you see the guys that get on stage. You have their notebook. They're like, oh, hey, what's up? I'm tired page. Oh, alternative comedy. This guy, stupid page paid where I literally my new little move before each show. If no one does well I'll even do it for crowds looking. There's a scene from one of the star wars were [inaudible] about to fight the system and there's a force field in front of him and he's. And he's rocking like just get the. I do that to myself now before. Well I was just crazy pump up like I was going to ask you this because you do that neuro linguistic programming, right? Yeah, and you, you have like a certain thing you do right before you go onstage. That puts you in a, like a perfect state of mind was at work always. Yeah. What I do, it's, it's um, yes, and then I was doing it wrong.

Speaker 8:          02:13:09       We're a buddy actually say you shouldn't make it rich. Which realistic, whatever that word is I was talking to you shouldn't do it or now you're developing. And so what I do is I imagined the greatest show ever, just literally because your brain doesn't know, uh, uh, uh, something that didn't happen to you. If I was asked you tell me about lunch you had with your family yesterday and you told me you couldn't really tell me the way the launch actually went down. You've deleted distorted and generalized every situation in your life to what's important to you. Right. Where I could ask, let's say your wife tell me about lunch and she would almost give me, it'd be similar, but maybe she was paying attention to the TV that was on above you and in your store. You didn't tell me about the TV. It's kind of what people are, what you're looking out for because you have a.

Speaker 8:          02:13:56       This is wrong numbers, but like $70, billion bits of information your body's trying to figure out. Right. And you narrow that down to seven plus or minus two pieces of info at any given moment. Okay. Like if I was asking you what's the temperature like in here? How's the temperature? Unless you are focused on it, unless you were sweaty, the temperature might not even been in the equation. Why we're having this conversation. So with that, I imagined the greatest show ever, like my greatest show ever. And I kind of remind some last comment because there was that feeling of big light shit falling from the thing when I really felt eh and right when I get to that state, I squeeze my thumb. I put my thumb in between my fist like spiderman and squeeze it yet. Or you're shooting on a web? Yes, exactly.

Speaker 8:          02:14:39       That's exactly. You put it there. How did he do it? Now? You did it like two fingers like this, right? Yeah. Yeah. Well My. Because you don't let them enter the. Yeah. Yeah. He went like this. Or if I had the things as a kid who needs prayer, but I put it here and then I imagine that you get that feeling because now your brain imagines that awesome thing and I lock it in like a speed dot. Then what happened? Just covering your thumb because you want it, like fighters use it. Sometimes fighters have a thing. You do it in a. In a movement that you don't replicate on a normal basis. We don't do it. I it. So I squeeze my thumb and then sometimes when I'm in an awesome mood or even if I come home and my dogs, they're, they're tag, their tails are wagon and I'm like, oh this is great.

Speaker 8:          02:15:17       I'll squeeze my thumb and when I'm on stage, if I get a big laugh and get an a or say something that was really funny, I'll squeeze my thumb. So it's like a bank account. You put happy feelings or good feelings into that thumb. So then the for the days when you don't feel like going on stage or you got into an argument right before you went on stage, like self up gnosis is squeeze that thumb and it puts you right back to that place. Just like a song. It's called anchoring. Just like if you hear a song from back in the day, you can remember a girlfriend or. Yeah. So what you're doing is you're adding your sp dial to tyricine. Whether here's the deal, if, if you, if you think it works, then it completely works, which means you just have to convince yourself that it works.

Speaker 3:          02:15:55       I see you're not wearing your balance bracelets. And when I was at the mall the other day, some guy was trying to sell me on it and I asked if you've got a balance bracelet on both hands if it's better. And he said yes,

Speaker 4:          02:16:09       well this is recorded, but there's people that actually believe in that shit. Shane Carwyn believed in that shit. But here's the crazy part about it. One of the things that are ropes of Judaism from the forum, you know, filled the English dude. He posted on the forum an interesting observation that this guy had where people have done studies and showed that they actually did help athletic performance and the reason

Speaker 1:          02:16:30       is because people thought they helped and that is somehow enough even ready for this. Even if you know it's bullshit. Even people that knew it was bullshit and knew there was no physical way that this bracelet could give you better balance and make you athletic. Athletical athletically performed better. They would give it to people and they would still find significant benefit in it like somehow or another. Just opening the door to something making you better can make you better. Or what happens is a lot of times when you start talking, let's talk about nerves or shitty. If we keep it the show, you're starting, oh, the show sucks. Oh, but that person's probably going to heckle. And what happens is as you talked yourself into a really shitty show, like do that. You talk yourself into people that are going no, but I will play scenario scenarios out in my head. You you play like,

Speaker 4:          02:17:15       like heckles fas having, but I'm not saying just for a second because Brian, you're, you're really new to the game or you've only been doing comedy like a little bit now. I mean really over the last couple of years. Over this nine years off that you had, do you ever before you go on stage, you should be nervous as fuck. Do you ever go on stage and said nervous? Nervous anymore? You're fine. You just go out there and do it when they're nervous to tell you so much. Brian did. I mean people will say that Brian had like a shortcut and Brian, you know, all he had to do

Speaker 1:          02:17:48       was just start doing open mics and we had them in front of packed houses. Brian went up in Austin, fucking Texas after Joey Dad

Speaker 4:          02:17:57       was a steel. You have to have a fucking complain. I've never looked at me and I'll tell him to his face. Never gave me a look of go after joey crush rushed and he would tell me to crush if crush, crushing, like get out there and I can work tonight. Fuck what I'm saying. One time we were in, we were in, we were in Austin one night and he came up to me afterwards like I and he's like, that joke didn't work and I'm fucking Howard because that's fun and I didn't give a fuck. It's true. That joke didn't work, but it's. Brian has balls of steel now. Lane never complained to me. Never ever.

Speaker 1:          02:18:33       He had been off for nine years. He had an any six years, six years, no standup at all. He got up at a midnight show in Atlanta, Georgia at a UFC punchline in Atlanta. That's a fucking. First of all, that's a bad ass old school club. To have that club, to go up for your first time and on a sold out show on a fucking Friday night, a late night show, midnight show. Fucking goes onstage and kills. Not only did he kill, he pulled himself out of a downward spiral like you did. Really good in the beginning and then he started bombing and he figured out a way to pull himself out of the bombing. You know why? Because he doesn't have a lot of ego. When you have a lot of ego, that's when you can never pull out of a bombing person who like takes themselves super seriously and then it gets devastated onstage by, by a joke, joking those. The people that can't pull out a bombing. Come to a point in my life when I got another fucking email about standup one another twit and you put me off

Speaker 7:          02:19:28       or people come up to you and talk to you and put you off. I'm at the point. Stand up. I want to just say get the fuck away from me. So whenever I see somebody like Brian do the standup Brown and gold bottom ball lists, you know, because it's completely out of Brian where he just goes up. I love him. I love him. Just for that. I give them that respect because I know how hard it is and I know how many exclusives we've all heard and we don't give a fuck. All I want you to do is be happy. If you come up to me and say you want to get on stage, I'll give you all the love I can to get you up to that stage, but don't let me see your three months later and you still bullshitting me because I did that too. It took me six months, took me six months of canceling at the comedy works and then show it up and finally doing it. Then you get hope, but I do give you a lot of love for that brand. Probably one of the reasons why he talked to this, because you don't give a fuck when it comes to stand up and as soon as he gets to a stage your walk at them and say, where's the drink ticket? Bitch?

Speaker 1:          02:20:20       As a kid I used to do open mic nights with back in Boston. Route was kind of half ass in it. In the beginning I was into it, but it wasn't into it because I was still fighting at the time and I was still working full time, so still fighting kickboxing tournament and shit, so I was training I pretty much every night and then trying to go do standup afterwards so I was fucking tired all the time. I was burning the fuse at both ends and some fucking kid that I did open mic nights with goes, you're pretty funny when you first started out man, but you seem to have kind of fizzled and he's being honest with me and I stopped and I thought about it. I was like, Shit, you know, he's just like saying it like you're, you're really funny. In the beginning he kind of fizzled and I didn't argue with them back, which is what I normally would have done, but I'm like, fuck you.

Speaker 1:          02:20:57       And I thought about. I'm like, God damn. He's probably right. What the fuck am I doing? I didn't. I had a guy say, he came and saw me in Austin, a friend of mine, and he did show it and I thought it was a good show and he goes, I've seen you like a bunch of times. He goes, you've done comedy for 23 years, you need to rip it every time, and then I immediate, you need to rip it every time to rip it, like, just crush. He goes, you know why? He was probably saying that his girlfriend wanted to fuck you or motivated me because then I started going know that crowd just kind of then. And then I'm making all the excuses. You know, I, I, I, I, there was a point where I switched off, maybe start phoning it in and then. And then that's when I choose my thumb, but some shows, I mean, when you do 500 of them, you're going to have to suck your thumb. Do I suck my. I never did. No,

Speaker 7:          02:21:41       you suck it up. Don't. I was a kid. I was when I was a kid, when I was a fucking kid, I was hooked on pacifiers do. I was like six years old dog, big time. I used to hide them from my mom and hide them all over the house and I used to play ball in the house. My mom would see you gonna fucking break something of mine. One guy. So she had these Japanese girls with different fucking ways. They're like 10. Jesus had broken. My Mom's like, you're done now. You gotta pay me all the money you owe me. You got to get a day job. I was like, fine. I'm like, she's like, I need like 30 fucking, Geez, you know you can make $50 a week or you can start sucking. Those pacifies dog stops are going to stop sucking them. And I'm like, because I would suck. I'm like the way people smoke cigarettes, I get into a fistfight and run home and syringes to hide them outside in the car and you just see you in the corner. Just I want to talk about that thing that we talked

Speaker 6:          02:22:26       about before the show, but I don't. I do, but I don't. Yeah, right, right. Should we. We should. The electronic thing folks, you want to know what level they're kicking it here in California. Do you want to know? Do you want to really know they have electronic cigarettes? Look what Brian's holding up that are all weed there too. How many hits $200? 200. 200 hits in those. Do you know how ridiculous that is? That one thing you could carry that around for you for days for you. You could carry that shit around for days and just get bullied. So you put the weed in there.

Speaker 8:          02:23:00       No preloaded, preloaded, and it's like a poll. That shit for preload and it has all to about $200. When you draw it for two to three seconds, two weeks, you got to charge it and it's. This is amazing. This is. You don't need a lie. That is a super blue dream. Where do you get this from? The shop? The only two or three seconds. It's called an m, e, d. A stick as tea is amazing. It doesn't smell at all except for when you you you have it. The problem is you can never smell weed when you're smoking weed. You don't smell it plain. I don't think you could do it on a plane because something's coming out and that's something we'll probably set up the alarm. So what I did here, it's water vapor, water vapor, back. Why do we need to do the water? Vapor is for the cigarette. They do it so people get the whole thing. You see the fake read, you go in and then you see the fake reds. Hilarious. Yeah. You see the and then you blow it out. So people who want to not smoke, they that you've gone through the whole motion, you see that, you light it and stuff like

Speaker 6:          02:24:02       fucking bat flew into Burbank. I had a talk with a competent Joe Rogan Joe Rogan. It's over Lucille. You. Why are you so greedy, man? Joe For starbucks. Have random drug testing. Joe Rogan. I talked to a cop, Burbank, uh, bob hope the motherfucker said. He goes, look, I don't care where we don't care where the fuck you flying no more. Please check your wheat. He goes, we get people checking. Weeding now for three ounces on the conveyor belt for security purposes. We don't give a fuck no more. Really. That's how bad it's getting lax to. They don't give a fuck. Used to be there. Didn't give a fuck if you're going to somewhere in California now they just said, just check it. You're on. Really? So you can bring weed through the. The, the fucking PSA. Don't hold that. Brian, what are you going to have all the information?

Speaker 6:          02:24:58       Make them get on a trip. Put It, put it on the sick. You got to put your weed on the belt and let it go through. Fucking the thing. Real. So you tell them this is weed. Yeah. They know. They know they keep that thing going and taking his ball and gone home. So listen, this was near the end of the podcast so I gotta get the fuck out of here because I'm going to the premiere of warrior tonight. Brian counts me. I'm going to go see that. That's going to be interesting. Or you don't even fucking permit them all. Bucky loss and bullet points. Darn Lucky Larson going to be a porn star. What's that movie? Yeah. Yeah. Me and what's the play? What's the part yet? The porn producer, they try to show me because it's like a big dirty bitch. It's Watson and a bunch of meetings.

Yeah, we were at the party. What sort of fucking body together? All of a sudden you forgot. Then I take it. No, you invited to the party. Stephen Dorff came with Gina Richie and Ben Owen. Owen Benjamin came at the end. I left you at the party with the drunk chick from fucking playboy. You forget now, Brian, I need to take you to a doc. That's it. Body weight the week to meet with the stakes on Donald Wooster. You need to run to my wife. Went to the wrap or at least a quick little brain cat scans pussies turning your brain to mush in goodfellas. Cocksucker. I saw him at the grocery store yesterday and tried to get a picture of how bad does he left? He was in one of those little carts that isn't even the fucking mob. Whoa. This shit smells like weed. I know exactly what it looks, but he was at the grocery store and that little part that they'll go, yeah, this smells exactly need. I was trying want to get a picture with. I told my wife, I go, just take a picture. I'm going to sandbag. Don't you should have gotten up to them. Told them you will hold it. Missing something here from. Because it smells like weed. Smell that.

Speaker 9:          02:26:51       Can you.

Speaker 6:          02:26:59       Is there something missing off the front or is it supposed to be like that? I think that's right. Smell though. Shit. You can smell the weed right through that. That thing stinks. Like wait, I can't take that nowhere. No, no. That's the same thing. You're trying to get me arrested, Bro. This thing stinks like crazy. Let me show you what some lights on it. Just know that shit. Joe. Brian, because Brian's doesn't switch. You smell the mouth part. Now I want to just did the smells like cheese and bread and everything that goes in my mouth. You know what I'm saying? Relax. So I went to on the constant over here. Hey, to get done. So this is the question that I had. I'm thinking about. I'm thinking about opening a comedy club and been thinking about that for the last couple of weeks. I've been telling you that for years.

Speaker 6:          02:27:41       You're right. You have been. You've been telling me about. We talked about buying the ice house at one point in time when they were trying to sell the ice house and like maybe what, what would it be like to buy a comedy club? What city would you do it? I don't know man. I would have to have somebody fucking run it though. Somebody that I trust to run it. That's the real problem because I ain't got the time to really blessed to have a club where we all had a vested interest in and we all worked out there all the time and we set it up the right way. I mean essentially like the comedy store was one of the greatest creative moments for you and I and a lot of other comedians, but why was it? Well, it's because there was a lot of great comics hanging out there and basically running the show.

Speaker 6:          02:28:15       I mean, that's what it was. It was a fun little club where we all got in and fucked around and people knew that they go there pretty much any weekend and see some fun shit. We need to recreate that. We can recreate that somewhere. It wouldn't be that hard as long as we'd all like small, like $200 to $15 even. That's too much. We don't want to compete with nobody, by the way. What's going on? Mad Dog. We have lots to talk about. What we love to talk. I want them to the Improv last Tuesday. That shit is fucked up. What are you talking to? Mom went to the Improv last week and Judy Brown was. There was the last time you went to the Improv on Tuesday. So I'm walking around shaking people's hands and all of a sudden as I'm walking out the door, get a tap on the shoulder.

Speaker 6:          02:28:56       I got a newspaper article drawn on me. Have you seen the news print button, front page of the business section in the La Times that caught our boy with our hand in the motherfucking cookie jar talking Robin Hartman sued by Bud Freeman, stealing like a motherfucker double dip and 15 percent. And owning the club. It's in there. You know why you ready for this one? What? The Guy told the story. They told us that they're going to open up three new clubs called levity. Yeah, but said enough is enough. Enough of you motherfuckers robbing me. The reason why they call them level. These don't have to pay the fucking franchise tax. And they've been doing it now for a long time. Stand up, live there, having a good time with the funny bones, but came out of that coma already. Cut like eight Jews together and he goes, we're going to get honest.

Speaker 6:          02:29:39       They've been out. Mark Lynas has been down there. It's over. The cat's out of the bag. Are you sure about all this? Look on that fucking newspaper and see what it says right there and I don't want to read it. Pay Out while you're getting worked up. I'm bosses the Impreza and been good to me no matter what I'm saying that every fucking dog has his day. They accusing you. You know where there's smoke. There's fire, but what I'm saying it's a small place. I'm not saying anything even close to as big as the employee. The club that I started off in Ann Arbor. That basement. What is that 150 people? You can have that place at 200 in the room or even like Wendy's clubbing in death, but that's, that's like 300 for sale. I don't know if it's still

Speaker 3:          02:30:27       that new side room where we did that. We did the death squad comedy show last week. That side room is fucking bad ass people. New sound system. New seats. You have to have a show there. Friday. My one man show that also my most likely yes, I'll

Speaker 6:          02:30:40       be there at all. Depends on where we're shooting for your factor that day. Most likely stage I need to get on stage because a lot of dates coming up. Ladies and gentlemen tomorrow. Um, the, uh, the tickets go on sale for our show at the verizon theater. October seventh, Joe Diaz and Wa and we're gonna. Um, we're gonna fuck that place on the case in Texas. We haven't been in Houston, Texas in a long time. Five years. We're going to. God Damn. Yeah.

Really those, the place where I first started selling out, I never sold on anywhere in the country. Houston, Houston

When my cd got released, we did a fucking free show there and advertise it on the radio and it was one of the most fun nights I've ever had in my life. And the Columbus like, oh, we gotta charge. Remember Mark Babbitt was like, we've got to charge. We got to charge. And you were you, you said it best. It's not in the spirit of the thing. It's not in the spirit. We were high as fuck.

Fucking show up that in the spirit of the thing. Do you have enough money?

Maybe this one because it's at the verizon wireless theater and they're charging me. And that's October seventh and Houston, Texas tickets go on sale tomorrow.
