Experience, gentlemen from the dark north of Canada, the white north enjoying the fabulous sun here. Well, it's sunny where you are too now, right? That's all right. Staggeringly beautiful, beautiful in the summertime is fantastic. She is a seductive bitch into summer Canada. She really is. She's like, hey come. No problem. Yeah, come on. Set up a house, built some stuff, couple of bugs, no biggie. And then Bam, ice vista snow around your hot for all the tenants. Yeah. I have friends that live several hours north of Edmonton. Oh yeah. Oh. And uh, I visited them in the spring and it's fantastic. It's just called. Okay. I just green and the walleyes fishing is absolutely how, how do you end up living a few hours? Like did they disturb them?

Speaker 2:          00:04:03       I mean to me that they get cursed in some horrifying way. But what happened? That's a good question there from there. Oh, they streck dodging villagers. They're really nice folks. Wow. Um, and uh, they're, they're from there. My friend Johnny Rivet and Janny Rivet and uh, they actually run a hunting camp up there. So they do a lot of their business up in the, in the bush, as they say, Canadian Bush, but it's so beautiful up there in the spring and summer. Oh yeah, it's fantastic. And for, you know, for a little bit in the winter, you know, pretty sparkly and then after awhile it just becomes this ice dungeon and you're like, chew your way out like a Ferritin, an upturned aquarium. Yeah. That's how you really would not good for your health, like your mental health at least to be trapped in those environments. But what, you know, so after, uh, after high school I wanted to, college had broke and I got a job as a gold pan or a prospect or I spent about 18 months, like fly in camps, uh, looking for debt, getting soil samples, looking for gold and stuff like that.

Speaker 2:          00:05:04       And Yeah, you're in a tent for, you know, four or five months with the same people. And I, they were smokers too, so I basically, it was like this little co, you know, I'm up north, it's so clear. It's so pristine. I was a little tent sale, tent sites, cube of smoke for six months. I think it's going to have permanent health effects even now. Yeah. That is one of the weird things about smokers is that they're more than willing to impose that on other people. That's a strange thing that they don't find. Like it would bother me if I was a smoker and I was sitting in a box with somebody and just subjecting them to my toxin. I know it's minus 40 but c'mon step outside. I mean how often do you go to a pool party and say, you know, I don't feel like going inside to pee so I'm just going to let it go. You know what I mean? There's no non piece side to that pool and there's no nonsmoking side to a restaurant anyway. Yeah. Smoking. And the other thing about smokers is there's a lot of them that don't have any problem with littering and I think it has something to do with the fact that they're their

Speaker 1:          00:05:58       fucking, their body up. So this is like cognitive dissonance of like there's something involved in, like you have to have a separation of clarity. If you're willing to, you, it's your will. You're lighting the cigarette, you're putting it up to your lips, you're sucking in poison. And they, so many of them throw their cigarettes on the ground. So many of them, and I really think there's a connection because it's very rare that you see someone drink a soda and then throw the cat on the ground. But I in front of people, you'll see someone take a cigarette, throw the ground, step on it, and just walk away. Like as if it's out of sight, out of mind. I think it has a direct connection to this, this connection.

Speaker 3:          00:06:35       You could test that, you know, you, you could go to like the healthiest food store, like up the street, there's this, a Vegan, uh, sit down food store, whatever. You get a cafe, Vegan cafe. It'd be interesting to see if people come out of that with the Care Kale shakes and just throw crap on the ground. I bet you that almost nobody would. But you know you're hanging outside some, you know skeevy pool hall with a bunch of smokers and it's all that her out front. Yeah. Your body is the world is all that kind of stuff. I think.

Speaker 1:          00:07:01       Yeah. It's like the one thing where like it's really common to litter with like that's the like if you like if you have like survey says if you were on family feud, most common thing to litter, I'm on doing the old dude who's dead. Meanwhile it's been like five guys. Richard Dawson, Dawson Hogan's heroes, remember? Yeah. But now it's Steve Harvey. Yeah. It's not the same. But yeah, I would think that that would be like the number one thing. It's like cigarettes. So you were stuck in this tent with these dudes and they didn't have any problem smoking in front of you in a tent

Speaker 3:          00:07:32       just nonstop. And they were like, they weren't even like, like they would like light cigarettes off the previous cigarette. Like I think they, the kind of smokers who other than sleeping had not had a breath of fresh air in about 10 years. Like they hadn't had anything coming into their lungs that wasn't tar based. And I said, I know one of them's dead now and uh, I'm not sure where the other one is, but uh,

Speaker 1:          00:07:52       yeah, that's, if you were an alien and you were studying human behavior, cigarettes would be one of the weirdest ones. One of the weirdest things you'd have to pay attention to. Like how the fuck did that take root on so many people?

Speaker 3:          00:08:04       Oh, it's a, it's a, it's a legitimate payback for the like smallpox laced blankets that the early settlers gave the Indian. It's like, okay, fine. Yt you can give us a TB lice blankets here, smoke this. And like, Ooh, that's good. Well let's get a wipe out more of us than a view. But it'll take time and it'll go with a smile on her face.

Speaker 1:          00:08:19       Well, I'm wondering, I don't think they use tobacco in the same way. I think most native tribes that use tobacco, they use it like a cigar or like a pipe or they're not inhaling it. They just get it into their mouth. And when you get into your mouth, it gets into your bloodstream, you get the nicotine. Okay. That's why you can get cancer from cigars when it's more rare. Even people that are like really branding

Speaker 3:          00:08:43       Freud in cancer cause he like, he had like 20 cigars a day and he got, I think half is cheeky in a way with cancer and stuff like

Speaker 1:          00:08:49       to what's going on in his life. Yeah. A lot of the chewers get that to those people that keep that stuff like in between their lip

Speaker 2:          00:08:56       and gum. Weird evidence. Yeah. But, uh, it's, it's not that common with pipe smokers, pipe smokers. That's the original way to do it. You just sort of take in the nicotine. In fact, nicotine is like a part of a, a lot of psychedelic rituals in the Amazon. They below nicotine smoke that blowed tobacco smoke on the people that are going through these psychedelic rituals. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know. For whatever reason, I don't know how the fuck we got on this stuff, but, so, uh, I was on, uh, Ana Kasparian show your, you're good buddy. You're good friends. Yesterday. And we had, we had some interesting conversations and part of it was about you and um, and I appreciate that. I know you were talking just before the show. I don't care what you say about me. Just make sure you spell my name right. Well that's what I was telling her in a way.

Speaker 2:          00:09:40       I was saying, you know, she was getting upset, you know, the things that you had said about what she had said and I said, well you got to lick. This is a weird thing that goes on where people make these sort of call out videos. You know, everybody likes to do a call out video but nobody likes to call out video turned on them. And what Anna did is essentially she listened to Adam Carolla's rant about conservatism and she made a rant about that and then you made a rant about her rant and then she's pissed a, your rant about her rant about Adam's rant. And I'm like, first of all, this is like incredibly ineffective way to communicate. You know, when people like I, I, it's one of the things that I don't like about blogs. I think blog entries are great in some ways, uh, because I think it gives someone to, uh, an opportunity to really expand on their thoughts.

Speaker 2:          00:10:28       And you can put a lot of energy and effort into writing something down. Whereas I think you might be able to get into deeper detail than you would in a conversation where you perhaps searching for words or trying to clarify the position. A lot of things you need to look up and you can't do that and necessarily in a debate. So it's nice having a back and forth debt when it's database, sorry, go ahead. But it's a massive amount of time involved and it's, it's, it doesn't give the other person the opportunity to respond. And when you, you do it, like one person goes on this long rant describing you in very disparaging terms and you know, minimize is you, and then, you know, you have to respond to that and then you go that it's way better to just sit down and talk through ideas.

Speaker 2:          00:11:09       So there's a lot of these ideas that, um, you have said that are very controversial that we're going to give you opportunities. He's no way. I know, it's crazy. And to be fair, I mean, um, I was working on the flight down, I was working on a response. I was hoping to go in and talk to them. We, we knew we needed them and emailed them and said maybe we could go and have a debate. I think that would be interesting and fun and useful, very important issues that are being talked about. But, um, we didn't hit a bank, so, yeah. Well, you probably pissed her off, you know, that's what, that's what I mean, if you're not annoyed, it's not a good debate. That means it's not that important. Right. I guess. Yeah. I guess, um, the, the, the, the core of the conversation was Adam's position on being a conservative and how the term has become

Speaker 1:          00:11:54       a pejorative and then the term conservative is become a negative way of describing a person's behavior and a person's thoughts. It's more like, it seems that it's become, um, uh, maybe like a badge of callousness or a descriptive term of someone who's insensitive or who does not care about the underclass. It does not care about poverty, does not care about poor people. And you know, she had this take on it and then you had to take on her take on it. Um, uh, you, can you consider yourself conservative? You consider yourself a libertarian, right? I'm an anarchist. An anarchist. And what is that exactly,

Speaker 3:          00:12:34       exactly. Well, I mean, so, and I was resistant anarchist. Like for me, I was 20 years, what's called like a mineral cast. It came sort of out of the objectivist iron ran school, uh, where your government is basically law and national defense. Maybe a court system, maybe that's sort of tiny, tiny government. It's called the night watchman state, which is, you know, keep, keep other people's Mitsoff my staff and keep their shifts out of my kidney kind of thing. That's, that's the basic function of government. And I was like, ah, but it always bothered me because that's, that would still have to be funded through taxation, right? Taxation philosophically, morally is the initiation of force, right? I mean it's like I have a good idea. You have to pay for it and if you don't pay for it, you are going to get some letters.

Speaker 3:          00:13:16       And if you don't pay for it still we're going to send some people over to your house and blue costumes. And if you don't pay for, it's still, they're going to take you off to jail. And so it is the initiation of force. And that always bothered me. And uh, I guess it was about a 2006, uh, I just, um, I just gave up the ghost as far as that goes. If you like, nobody wants to go with these particular directions. It's just principles, right? You have to sort of hang on your principles no matter what, right? So if you're into the non initiation of force, right? That, that self defense, perfectly moral, legitimate, but you can't go around pop and people in the head without provocation, you can't go around stealing people's stuff. So the non initiation of force and if you accept that as a principal and if you try to get philosophy as close to like the physical sciences, physical sciences, they don't have exceptions, you know, they say, well, this Rockwell, but we'll, we'll fall this fast in, in know Kazakhstan and this fast in Philadelphia, I mean this universal, right?

Speaker 3:          00:14:07       So if you're going to go with the nonaggression principle, then the concept of government, it's um, morally illegitimate because the government is that group of people in a geographical area that initiate the use of force against others. And some, some people agree with it and some people don't, but those who don't, uh, do end up being on the receiving end to force that they don't agree with it.

Speaker 1:          00:14:28       So in an anarchist state, the, the idea would be that there would be no taxes. So how would people fund roads? Would they voluntarily donate? How would they fund education? How would, how would things get done?

Speaker 3:          00:14:43       Well. Um, the first answer is I have no idea if I, because I mean, if you could design a future, then everyone should put me in charge of everything and right. That wouldn't make any sense. People build roads, government don't build roads. Right? And, and it's not, there's no entity called government. It's like this big a morphous flag that goes around and lays the tarmac. It's just people who receive money. So I mean, if you're going to build a bunch of houses, you have to build a road there. I mean, I mean, malls build parking lots, a air, air, airport spray, build roads. It's not government, it's all private. And you know, I in a gps you could charge people, you know, there's a private highway up in Canada way, you know, they take a photo of your license plate or if you have a transponder, it's even cheaper. And they just judge you when you go on. And however, you know, when you go off, then they charge you for that. So isn't that taxing you? Well, no, because that's volunteering

Speaker 1:          00:15:30       for use. Well, it's volunteering. You can use it, but if you have to get over there, is there other options without paying? Sure. Those are these other roads that mean because that will be competition, right? I mean hopefully, well not to the point of wasteful duplication because that would not be very efficient economically. And if there's a hundred rows going to the exact same direction, I'll say my side one costs a dollar a lot competition. I haven't seen a tree in four days or I'd be like, you know the movie Brazil where they have those billboards maybe on either side. So I think you pretty open in the idea that you don't have a solution, but what you're doing is saying that the current problem is unacceptable. Is that a fair way of assessing your, your take on current? Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:16:09       I mean technically it's not good philosophy to have a universal caught the nonaggression principle. But you and I and this fine fellow here in the listeners, we all accept, right? We all here voluntarily. You don't force anyone to come to your shows. I didn't force anyone to listen to what I do. So we all accept that at a personal level. And that's what we teach our kids, right? Yeah. Don't hit, don't take other people's stuff. Don't push. Do you know that kind of stuff. And so if we're going to have these rules, you know, much like science, like how far can we push these rules? Now I think that it's kind of wrong to say, well, we have these rules, but right up to here will completely abandon them and go to the opposite. Um, or at least we need to acknowledge that it's what's going on in society.

Speaker 3:          00:16:48       So if we say that the nonaggression principle is the way that we should live, well the government is just people. How do they get this? Get Out of jail free card where they can do stuff that is specifically illegal for the private citizens, like print money, like take out debts on behalf of other people and you and I can't do that. I can't go buy a car and send you the bill. And they can invade countries. They can force people to pay for things so they can incarcerate huge numbers of people. Largely on a whim. They can tell people who are doing things like drugs, which is a purely voluntary form of enjoyment and stuff. Medication, they can throw them in jail. I can't do that. You can't do that. If I'm on a pay for my kids' education, I don't get to walk up and down the street with a machete saying pay or die. I mean, but this is the way that we've set up or the wave. You've inherited society. Sorry, I don't want to go on to big Aranda. No,

Speaker 1:          00:17:31       but it's a good rent. It's a good point as well. The idea that it's society has been sort of inherited, you know, that we have sort of been born into this system that is really not that well engineered and has massive flaws in it. And uh, it's a very good point. When you talk about the reinforce the um, uh, the, the taxes, like enforcing tax laws that you can lock people in jail for owing money. It's one of the only times where someone gets locked in a cage because they owe money even if you choose to pay that money. Yeah. Wesley snipes is a perfect example. The actor chose to not pay his taxes based on an erroneous belief. He had this belief that the constitution does not, does not force you to pay taxes and that it's a misunderstanding that if you fight it in court, you would, when he had these terrible advisors.

Speaker 1:          00:18:22       So he decided to not pay taxes for a long time and he made a really large sum of money. And that is when they go after you, when you're one of those people that is already the privileged few, making an exorbitant amount of money and then you step up and say you don't have to pay taxes and you do it blatantly didn't even matter if he tried to pay the money back, they were going to lock him in jail no matter what it felt like this is, it's not, it's a crime and it's the only time it's a crime to owe money. You know, every other time it's like we have a debt and you know what, you have to pay that debt off. Like, say, if I loaned you 100 bucks and we went to court and the court found out that you didn't pay me that a hundred bucks, you don't go to jail, you just have to pay me 100 bucks.

Speaker 1:          00:19:01       But if you're the government 100 bucks, they have the option to lock you in a cage. And that to me is sort of akin to shitty parenting. You know, like you're, you're a, a strong believer in, uh, not hitting kids and not screaming at them. And if you're tired and you're dumb and your kid doesn't want to listen, one of the best ways to get them to listen to you is violent force or fear. Those are the best ways. And it's, uh, it's been a huge problem throughout. You know, it's, it's, as far as recorded history, I mean, people have been beating their kids. People have been yelling at their kids, people who've actually even defended it. You know? And I think that this lazy use of force is very similar to what the government does. It's almost like they feel like their hands are tied. There's 350 million people they have to get money from. What's the best way to do it? Scare the fuck out of him. The block, that actor in jail, that Wesley Snipes, he put him in a cage. Make an example out of him and anybody else that steps out of line, lock them in cage too.

Speaker 3:          00:19:57       Lauren Hill to Lauren Hill, the food just solo artist. Fantastic singer and yeah, she's serenading like James Brown and the in the, and the echoing holes of the incarceration station

Speaker 1:          00:20:08       talks about that either she didn't never heard anybody, she didn't do anything. She's got some wacky ideas I've ever heard that broad talk.

Speaker 3:          00:20:14       Ooh, well if you're pretty and talented, sometimes people don't step up to say. But the other thing too is that there are things that I find extremely morally objectionable, like, like at a skin crawling, visceral base of the spine, the electrification kind of feeling like, I hate the imperialism of a lot of the western countries, particularly in America right there, the invasions of Iraq and, and all that. I just, I find that stuff unbelievably reprehensible. And as you can see, the entire society has disintegrated. Now. I hate the war on drugs. I really, I mean at a very fundamental level, I think, um, it is absolutely abhorrent and destructive. You know, we saw some of the, I think the shake out of that and Ferguson, Missouri recently, which I think a war on drugs had a lot to do with that stuff. And the fact that I'm forced to, to fund this, it goes violently against my conscience and I feel very helpless to, um, to, to not support the things that I find incredibly objectionable and incredibly destructive, uh, to, uh, to particularly minorities is unbelievably horrendous. And I'd like to have the right to say no, I really would like to have the right to say no to that kind of stuff. There's lots, I mean, I do charitable work and I give away my shows for free and I'm very happy to share whatever goodies I've accumulated in life with people who are less fortunate or needy. But there's so much that goes on in the world that governments do that I find just so horrendous. And I would really like none of the above as one of the options.

Speaker 1:          00:21:41       Yeah. None of the above. But how do these things get funded then? How would they fund war? How would they fund, you know, that would be very tricky. They would have to get creative. Yeah. I was listening to hardcore history. You ever listen to hardcore history, Dan Collins? Yeah. Oh yeah, yeah. We've done some shows together. Yeah, he's fantastic show. I really love it. And he's got a new episode and it's about World War One and it goes into great detail about the massive losses that were just, just racking the French forces and the the German artillery and all this shit that was going on and how it was becoming increasingly difficult to get people to sign up for the war, especially with English. The English folks trying to get them to sign up, like had gotten to the point where he had lost 500,000 people, 500,000 casualties in a short period of time.

Speaker 1:          00:22:31       And you know it, it gets to that point where people aren't buying it anymore. Like in the beginning it was easy to sort of coerce people into doing it by, he was actually going into depth about people with shame. People like women, like pretty white feathers. Yeah, yeah. They would put a white feather on you if you weren't in uniform. If you weren't a military person, you weren't, you were a coward and you were considered to be a coward. And it was so much so that they had to kind of figure out a way not to, because there were many people that are involved in the war effort that weren't soldiers, that people that were building munitions and people that were making guns and people that were involved in all sorts of different levels of government that weren't cowards in their eyes. But you know, they were getting attack the same way everybody else was. It was sort of like a feeding frenzy and it's, it's, it's interesting to see, uh, especially when you're talking about the early 19 hundreds of the essentially a hundred years ago, the talking about this, the use of manipulation of trying to get people to go along with war, especially back then when there was so much less information available to the average person, whereas today, trying to get someone to go along with wars far more difficult, far more problematic.

Speaker 3:          00:23:41       Well, and this is terrible, um, power that the government has to money at will, which

Speaker 2:          00:23:46       the first World War Lashley and gendered in the first World War could not have been fought on the gold reserves that the country has had at the time. It would have been over in six to 12 months. And so right now they can just create this money out of thin air. Right. So I mean the, the war in Iraq did not come with equivalent. The war on terror did not come with equivalent massive tax increases to pay for it cause they just printed all this money and this messed up the economy. It was inefficient contribution to the housing crash and all of the mass that's gone ever since then. And so for me, it's like, well, wouldn't this weight make war more difficult if you had sort of privatized a defense systems? It's like, yes, yes, yes. That's what we want. Let's make more, more difficult to, to embark on and pursue and make sure that it's defensive.

Speaker 2:          00:24:26       Aggressive was a very expensive defensive wards are relatively cheap. I mean, look at what defeated in a sense, the American military in Iraq, I mean, what was the cost? How much did America spend versus how much did the people defending themselves spent a look at, uh, a Vietnam, what people were defending themselves and around the inceptions essentially as a blood bath though, but, and just, I'm terms of dollar cost, right? So you can bring down a $20 million plane, but the $20,000 Stinger missile attacking is very expensive. Defending is very cheap. But look at how poor a job they did a defending, I mean, a million civilians were wiped out. Their entire country was essentially taken over. The only reason why they don't the United States is now full power of Iraq is because that was never the objective in the first place. And because we abandoned it and pulled out, right, I mean their defense of the military, the United States military was woefully ineffective.

Speaker 2:          00:25:17       So like saying that it's inexpensive, it's kind of silly. I don't know. I just want to 10 credibly in effective. Well, but the goal again is a stated goal of the leaders of al Qaeda was to provoke America into the same kind of war that Russia got into in Afghanistan that broke the Russian economy and collapsed their empire. It was to get America to start waging war in a way that was much more costly to the Americans. I mean, human side, I agree with you. I mean a rack is just a complete mess and, and not just physical, but genetic damage from all of these depleted uranium shells. They've wiped out the genetics of an entire population. Uh, birth, birth defects and leukemia. And I mean, it's unbel. It's literally like hell since Desert Storm since the first year, since the first one. But even more so I think in the second, but from a pure dollars and cents standpoint, their goal was get America into these unwinnable wars against these insurgents because I mean this is what the CIA taught to be enlightened in the 80s with the Mujahideen was gold, gold.

Speaker 2:          00:26:14       Get the Russians to come in and then just keep pinging them off and picking them off and picking them off until they go broke. What we're talking about two completely different locations now we're talking about Iraq and Afghanistan, two completely different environments and Afghanistan. One of the reasons why it's almost an entirely unwinnable war is because of the terrain. I mean, Afghanistan is like trying to fight a battle in the rocky mountains. It's insane. Yeah. I mean if you look at the terrain that these people were involved with it, it's just crazy. It's mountains and there's no cities. You have war lords that our own, you know, these particular parcels of land and it's, it's a crazy, crazy place. The idea of taking over Afghanistan. I mean, you would literally have to comb the mountain side and pull everybody out and, and camp them or something.

Speaker 2:          00:26:59       I mean, there's no way you can't, there's no, there's no cities to take over. You know, it's a completely unwinnable geographic situation. But Iraq, totally different story. I mean, Iraq to death, it was cities. Yeah, for the most part. Right. So you've got a lot of places you can take over, but, but we, if we were invaded like that in this anarchist version of society, what would you do? I mean, you, you obviously could enforce your version of society on other people if you have dictatorships, like say North Korea or something along those lines that has a strong military power and decided to invade. What are you doing? An anarchist society? I mean, that's, you know, let's say you have, you have a, an advocate society and next all you have some status society. Right? Okay. I mean, there's a couple of answers, which you know, who knows, right?

Speaker 2:          00:27:48       But one of the answers is that invading an anarchist country is pretty tough because what are you going to take over? So if you look at countries that invade other countries, they they take over the tax system. Natural Resources. Well, to some degree, one of the main reasons why we in vain countries, it's like if the hugest reason, well I'm not sure if, I mean that doesn't really explain much about Afghanistan, although there are some arguments that massive amounts of minerals, trillions of dollars in minerals, but you can get that trade, right? I mean, you don't have to go and invade and why would you do that when you can just take it? If you have no cities, you have cobble and then you have like a bunch of dudes with goats and you go, yeah, I think we're going to just go over there and take your shit.

Speaker 2:          00:28:27       Right. Why would you do that when you're this giant military force and you also make money in invading, right? Because the people that are contractors that get government funds to go over there and spend money on tanks and planes and it's a huge business. The business of the military industrial complex cannot be denied. But he was a mass made money because I know that there's the theory have. So who's, who's made money from the invasion of Afghanistan? Of all Halliburton, Halliburton, no, no, that's mass amounts of money. But in terms of the minerals, like in terms of getting the minerals, because I know that they're for sure, yes, but who's actually making money from it? Well, they haven't yet because they have to figure out a way to extract them. Lithium, there's a lot of minerals that we need for Tesla cars and cell phones and all the battery operated things that we use.

Speaker 2:          00:29:11       For the most part, we use lithium ion. That's the current technology and the trillions of dollars worth of that stuff in Afghanistan when the biggest supplies of it in the world. Right. So. Okay, so they located it and it's like even if it hasn't been extracted, it's like we're not going to let anybody else go over and control that area because you're talking about massive, massive amounts of money and resources. Well, it sort of remains to be seen because if the argument is why they wouldn't have had the resources, they've been in there for what, 12 years now, and if they still haven't extracted the resources, that argument,

Speaker 3:          00:29:42       I think it's much more around Halliburton and the military industrial complex, making a huge amount of money by basically picking the pockets of the unborn for inflation and debt. So I think that's much more immediate. I think that's like a 12 or 15 year plan to get the resources. I think that's maybe something that's in the back pocket, but I think they really make money off the Fed. That's Fed Brinton, right?

Speaker 1:          00:29:59       Yeah. That's certainly the current way that they're making money, but it's, I don't think it's an either or. I think without a doubt there's, there's plans on trying to figure out how to get those resources. But I think that's the main reason why people invade countries. It's natural resources. They don't invade because they want to control the population for no reason and turn them into slaves. They invade because they need something that the other people have.

Speaker 3:          00:30:24       Okay. So, I mean it Germany, but generally invade countries that when they invaded Czechoslovakia and Austria and France and so on, they invaded and took over the tax base so that they got all the tax money and they've got the gold and all that. So if there's no tax structure, then it's less profitable to invade and take over a country. That's not a final argument. That's sort of one, one thing. It's sort of like if you've got two areas, uh, that you're thinking of taking over one of them as a farm and the other one is just a forest with nothing there you'd want to take over the farm because everyone's already domesticated and there's already a system of production so that like the farm is like the government system where the, the human livestock, the tax lifestyle already domesticated, the whole system of payment is all set up and so on.

Speaker 3:          00:31:03       So it's more profitable. Usually if you want to just get money and resources to go and into an existing country with the state to go into a country without a state, it's, it's tough. You can still do it, but you don't have that farm domestication production system all set up for you to take over. The second thing is that new nuclear weapons generally mean you don't get invaded, right? I mean this, why did Europe suddenly find Kumbaya? You know, let's hold hands and be peaceful after Ken billion years of warfare because they got nuclear weapons and the Post Second World War period, and with nuclear weapons, suddenly it's like blessed are the Peacemakers. So most, you know, if you get a couple of nukes, uh, then you're most likely not going to be in the how those new skid fund they get funded by still will pay taxes.

Speaker 3:          00:31:47       I know, isn't it? But this is the thing, right? I mean, because, and this is what I was making the beef fat with Anna as well. This is something needs to be done going to say, therefore we need a coercive redistributionist. Yx State is, to me, sort of similar to saying, well, where do we come from? What God made us? It's not really much of an answer, right? So, yes, you'll need nukes now running a nuke for a population of any kind of size, having a couple of nukes will cost you like five bucks a year, 10 bucks a year for everyone to chip in. People will generally do that. People tip waiters, right? I mean, you've worked in nightclubs. The waiters. Dot. Starving and Mac ate it. Right. So people will generally pay for things that can be shown, have a value to them.

Speaker 1:          00:32:25       But aren't you? I mean the nonviolent principal, aren't you the person that doesn't advocate violence doesn't want war

Speaker 3:          00:32:32       on initiation? Self defense is different.

Speaker 1:          00:32:35       Okay, so you were in favor of using nuclear weapons for self defense.

Speaker 2:          00:32:38       I think it's one possibility. It's one possibility. Execution of nuclear weapons. I would absolutely view that as a last resort for sure. Because of course there's so many innocence who get caught up in that. Let me give you another couple of possibilities. There are weapons you can create that are targeted to people specific DNA. In other words, you can release an illness that only will kill somebody specific DNA. Oh, that sounds like a fucking dream. That doesn't seem like it would be possible. I'm telling you, I'm telling you I've been done. Is that a proof of concept? Does that, I'm not sure if it's been done, but there's some are certainly ways of targeting from the start of a movie where shit gets terribly out of control and then it's mad max well, but whether or not right when you have a bunch of people who all have governments invading each other, there's kind of an unwritten rule which says don't tag it, the leaders because they don't want that to happen.

Speaker 2:          00:33:24       On the other hand, uh, an anarchic societies, perfectly comfortable targeting leaders, which would really be the best thing to do. I would much rather target a leader and disabled that person or even kill them if that leader was initiating a aggression against a free society. Uh, that to me would be the way to go and that would be a significant disincentive. That seems like, that sounds like a beautiful idea, but that seems cool daily. I mean, past the first hurdle. Yeah. But doesn't that seem highly unlikely that anybody would be able to engineer genetic disease that's going to cause piece that seems like, I mean, if that's the way to go about doing this, I mean is that the only way if you can target the leaders of people who are going to invade you, that just seems to me like the best sense, right?

Speaker 2:          00:34:07       I mean why, why, why all the while all the surfs killing each other in France in the first world war. It's the leaders who started at all whom, you know, that old pink Floyd sign, you know, a general sat by the lines on the map move from side to side. I mean it's the general suicide in the war. Well, it's a different time. You know that back then it's completely different because the only way you were getting information was through newspapers and we weren't able to have independent journalists giving you the full facts of the situation. Like we're able to today. But if you did do that, you create a power vacuum. One of the things that people don't understand about what's going on in Chicago. Everyone's like, why is there so much violence in Chicago? I talked to a cop when I was in Chicago and he gave me a unique point of view and what he said was, what happened is they arrested some of the big Dame drug dealers.

Speaker 2:          00:34:53       They arrested some of the top dogs. When they arrested these guys, they created a power vacuum and boom. That's what's going on. That's also what we see going on in the Middle East with Isis. Yeah. With that is is we see a power vacuum. The United States is pulling out of Iraq and then we're being forced to go back in there now and try to deal with this. That was that journalist that was just beheaded. Fucking crazy shit going on. These guys, the isis videos that they're putting out on youtube, it's like they're taking extremism to a completely new level. They're taking violence and they're taking the shockingness of it. All the, the, the, the fear tactics. They're taking it to a whole new level, putting these execution videos on youtube. Brutal, brutal videos. I don't know how they're on youtube got taken down right away. But they weren't

Speaker 1:          00:35:38       though. There was over a hundred thousand views in a bit up for a couple of months. It's one that I watched. Yeah, it had been up for at least 30 days. I know that for a fact. And it was over a hundred thousand views and it was brutal. Was Execution Style. There was shooting these guys that were on the ground and they cut this guy's head off while he was alive. That's a power vacuum. I mean that's, that's the result of a power vacuum from the United States pulling out. I don't know. I mean, I think this, this idea of this anarchistic society is interesting. It's an interesting alternative. It's certainly, look, the society that we have right now is massive flaws. It's certainly open for improvement, but I dunno. Uhm, I dunno how you fight off bad guys, you know, I just don't know.

Speaker 3:          00:36:19       Well, but we had a state, but, but that is, is, um, to not view set and aspects of the state as the bad guys. Right. So, uh, to me, I think there's better ways to protect my property than giving people the right to take half of it away at gunpoint. You know, that three with you seem sort of logical. I'm, and I don't know how it's going to go, but let me give you an analogy and I've used this before and I'll, I'll keep it brief, but we've learned how to do without evil and problematic institutions before. I mean the institution of slavery obviously was, was central throughout human history all throughout the world, uh, for all of human history that has ever been known or recorded. So like 100,000 years, basically people had slaves and then there was a crazy bunch of people who came along and said this stuff is wrong and bad and so on.

Speaker 3:          00:37:04       And people spent a lot of time and energy and money to end slavery. And now we have, I think, some fantastic benefits from that. You know, we have, um, I mean obviously a more moral society, we have a better economic efficiency and all that kind of slaves was very inefficient. So we do end to subjugation of women. And things like that. Like there's things where we've said, or serfdom or or, or bondage share for, um, for debt. There's things that we've done away with that haven't created necessarily the same kind of power vacuum. Like when we get away with things from a moral standpoint, they usually isn't a power vacuum. If there's some decapitation of power without principles behind it, then people ration to to fix it. But I think we're not done yet as a species. I think we have more to go. And I think the question of the state is one that we really need to examine.

Speaker 3:          00:37:49       So if you were to say to somebody and like the 17th century, you say, okay, wait a second. Almost like basically all agricultural productivity is down by slaves. So if you get rid of slaves, what's going to happen? Right. And if I were to say to you, Oh man, I got a great idea, here's how it's going to work. We're going to have these giant robots that goes sweeping through the fields, which have the energy of a thousand horses and they rush, they run on the crushed tree juice from the dinosaur era and you'd say, what the hell are you talking about? That's impossible. It makes no sense. It could never happen, but that is what happened. We got these giant combine, half assist that run on gasoline and oil that comes out of crushed trees from hundreds of millions of years ago. So what happens when you get rid of an immoral institution is ungraspable.

Speaker 3:          00:38:37       And we don't know you used to be because you'd say what? Look 80% of people that are involved in farming. So if you're going to get rid of slaves, first of all, nobody's going to pick the crops because it's unpleasant work or whatever. And 80% of people will, you know, 40% of them will be out of a job. But now like 2% of people that are involved in farming because we got rid of slavery and it became much more efficient to invest in machinery rather than maintain the value of slaves by relying on manual labor. So what I'm saying is we focus on the principles. The non initiation of force is, I think a universal principle. What happens on the other side of that is absolutely and guessable it's like saying what a phone is going to be like in 200 years. Like nobody knows.

Speaker 1:          00:39:12       Right. So you're saying that the most important things to get rid of what is essentially a corrupt and evil institution. Get rid of that and then figure it out.

Speaker 3:          00:39:23       I mean, did you didn't? No, you didn't. And nobody ended slavery because things would be better afterwards. We ended slavery because it was an Mrl institution. Right. And the state, which relies on the initiation of force is fundamentally Mr.

Speaker 1:          00:39:35       But isn't there a difference between ending slavery, which is essentially a crime against humanity and ending government because government is essentially how we keep order and is in our countries. They really, as far as like you're bathing in an excess of order these days, I don't feel like it's perfect, but it's more order than chaos. So I don't think that it's ideal. No, absolutely not. But is it some form of an order? Clearly it's flawed. Clearly I don't like the tax scenario. I mean the tax situation is, is grotesque. I mean the idea of being forced to pay money for crimes against humanity in other countries, which is essentially what, when you see thousands of people that are innocent, that got killed by drones, a million innocence killed in Iraq, if that's not a crime against humanity, what is a crime against humanity? If millions of people dying isn't a crime against humanity? What's a crime against humanity? I don't, well, clearly slavery was a co a crime against humanity, taking people, locking them up, making them work against their will, selling them as objects, as property abolishing that is not the same as abolishing any form of government.

Speaker 3:          00:40:54       It was a foundation for all of human society, all the way throughout history, and it was central. It was central to how the economy worked. Like why was that no industrial revolution and the ancient Greek and Roman civilizations, they'd even discovered the steam engine. They knew all about this stuff. Why? Why was there no industrial revolution? Which was really the basis of all the wealth we have now because they had slaves. And so when you buy a bunch of slaves, you don't want to invest in labor saving machinery. You have to get rid of slavery in order for machinery to do the work of slaves or of of human beings, because then it becomes cost efficient and cost effective. So it's central to how society's south organized. Slavery was a central, I would argue to historical as government is. It's how everything was done. You know, that's an old story about, about Rome where one guy, one, one, Patricia was saying, I don't know, I can do some bizarre upper class Roman accent.

Speaker 3:          00:41:44       I don't know much, but that would be like, I don't even know what the shot, it's always English. Just pretend some British guy. I was like, oh my God. I was walking down the street and I said hello to a slave. I don't even know which one's a slaves and which ones aren't slaves. We should make them all way yellow tags on their shoulders. So none of us ended up talking to slaves and the other guy said, are you crazy? We can't put yellow tags on the slaves. Otherwise they'll see how many there are and how few we are. Right? So like 70 80% of the population in some cultures were slaves. And so it was as central to the ancient world and to a lot of the modern societies up until sort of the 17th 18th century as government is to now. And it says incomprehensible for them to think post slavery as it is for us to think post state. But the moral principles I think have to win out rather than consequentialism. Like because we can't possibly guess what will happen in terms of spontaneous self organization when you get rid of the coercion of the state.

Speaker 1:          00:42:38       The problem with your analogy though is that during the same time that the south had slavery, the North had abolished slavery. So then in the north was prospering. So they were Cohen coexisting. So there was not, not only was there a clear example of a profitable forward moving society without slavery, it was connected on the same continental mass. I mean, it was, it was a part of North America. It was the country. It was even a part of the actual union. It was, they were trying to succeed, but they had, I mean the, the North had no slavery and they had excellent cities and they had buildings and they were building ships and it was all done through paid labor, whereas at the same time, the south had slavery. I've, I saw something that I thought was really fascinating that you argued and you argued that the south should have been allowed to succeed. And then if the north wanted the slaves to be free, they should have purchased them from the south.

Speaker 3:          00:43:39       Oh, that's how slavery ended up or where else? I mean, the British government and the British taxpayers paid for a lot of the slaves that's record or some British, um, priest. A bishop, I think was paid like 12,000 pounds for his slaves. Basically, the way that slavery ended throughout most of the rest of the world was the government stopped catching slaves. And when the government stops catching slaves, they just, it has to be socialized. You can't go around chasing slaves who are running all over the place. It doesn't work anymore. The government and slaves that are escaping. Yeah. Yeah. So if, if the government stops catching the slaves, then it's not cost efficient to keep them. You have to socialize that cost and the cost. The government at the end of south, uh, the government forced, uh, white people to go on slave patrols all the time. Oh, they'd throw them in jail. Right. So looking for slim. Yeah. Looking for slaves. They hated that. Uh, so did it take 600,000 people dying to end slavery? Well, only in America

Speaker 2:          00:44:32       did that. Was that a requirement? Everywhere else it was, it was money, uh, and um, uh, moral brow beating and all that kind of stuff and legislation. It was the only in America. Was that a required? Isn't that, wouldn't it be required that they would agree to that though? I mean, what if they didn't want to give up their free labor? I mean the whole idea was you're saying that the reason why certain societies did not advance past a certain position was because they relied on slavery. And if you come along and you say, hey, we're going to buy all the slaves from the south, what if they say, no, we want to keep our free labor. It's more profitable for us to keep these slaves and make them work. But You keep bidding up until it's more profitable to sell them. Well, how do they, where's the United States get all this money?

Speaker 2:          00:45:17       Them might not have the north get the money to buy all those slaves. Where does that money come from? It comes from not having 600,000 people dead. Right. And when does it come from taxes? Before the people are dead? There's no debt of death. No, but what I mean, I said, yeah, it was hugely expensive, right? I'm just saying from a cost standpoint, it would have been much less expensive to buy the slaves then it would be who would have been to a wage that entire war. That's a hindsight is 2020 argument though, isn't it? Because no one knew how many people were going to die in the war and no one knew how expensive it was going to be. They just decided that they were going to go to war and they were going to win. Right. And that's how a lot of wars are fought.

Speaker 2:          00:45:50       That's how we got an Iraq and that's how a million people are dead and countless amounts of money have been spent. I mean we, who fucking knows how much money was spent and our rabidly since 2001 I think that if it didn't, they just fly over like giant crates, full of hundred dollar bills and basically just throw them into the wind. I mean, there's just huge amounts of of cash itself just went there. But that's the big lesson of history is that once you let slip the dogs of war, you don't know who they're going to take down. You don't know how long it's gonna last. You don't know what the blow back is going to be. That's one of the big lessons is that there's very few examples of contained wars in very few examples of wars that match the expectations that people going in.

Speaker 2:          00:46:26       So with hindsight being 20, 20, and 600,000 people dying. And what were the actual numbers of slaves that were eventually freed? Do we know how many, I've done a whole video on the history of slavery. Yeah. I can't remember honestly. Then I feel sometimes like a, a pipe with through which knowledge, pastas leaving no residue like to do these presentations. You know what I mean? You've had, you know, hundreds and hundreds of great conversation, but somebody said, oh, what did the podcast one thing to do. Yeah. My memory sucks. I mean, it's pretty good, but it sucks compared to what I would like it to be. Oh, I'd love to be this giant, you know, Museum of everything that happened. But, uh, uh, so documents I think a pretty strong that it would have been much cheaper, uh, to, to simply by the method. The other option of course is that you let them succeed and you let them have their slaves.

Speaker 2:          00:47:13       Uh, and then the north gets more and more prosperous and the south generally stays or it becomes less and less prosperous relative to handle. Allow that on your watch. How can you allow people to be enslaved? I mean, if, if there's anything that you as a person with morals and ethics, a person that wants the, the human race to advance and evolve, there's anything that you would want to stop. It would be slavery. That's one of the first things. First, you know, uh, abusive children, child slavery. I mean, in that order it's slavery. It's like number one, it'd be one of the murder and slavery would be like right next to each other. Those are the things you would want to stop, but you can't, you can't fight slavery with conscription. Conscription meaning what? Meaning that you are forcing people to come and fight your war because that's even worse than slavery.

Speaker 2:          00:48:02       Okay. So did there's a six and a half to be pulled up during the civil war? Is that a draft situation? So they force people to fight against the south? Look, it wasn't a good plan. It didn't work out well. The only good part of it was that the slaves were freed and slavery's illegal. Yeah. And I mean I would lie. I think that's a way, like I never advocate violence with regards to the state. It's something we outgrow. Its something we reasoned about. It's something we discussed. It's something we look for alternatives for. And you can see a lot of these things showing up. Even in Detroit there's a private to police forces now cause the police that basically said, you know, if you call and you get an answering machine, you're lucky. Right? I mean the police had basically abandoned sections of Detroit that are wild dogs going through there that people have set up their own bus systems where you can have a beer and there's Wifi on them.

Speaker 2:          00:48:47       I mean there's lots of things that rush into to take the place of a decaying or diminishing state systems. And I, it's just something we act, grow over time through a compensation and it is a multigenerational change. It's not going to happen anytime soon. But I do think that we are still a long way from don as far as a really great society goes and um, I look at the biggest institutions around and I, I think that everything is open to question. I think you do as well, but I just, I can't sort of say, well what's on the other side of a truly free society where people are not subject to the initiation of force known as the state? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know either. And I like having these conversations with you. I like having these conversations in this sort of a diff, a form.

Speaker 2:          00:49:31       We're bouncing, bouncing these ideas back and forth and we admit we don't know. And there are possibilities when you do your videos, whoever you're, you're doing these essentially these hour long pieces and you're very eloquent. You are very good speaker and it's, it's very unusual how eloquent you are because you, you don't use ums or Uhs, you don't stammer a lot and no jump cuts. Right. It's not like I had to be in the cuts. You're obviously very impressed with yourself doing that. I'm just mentioning. I am happy with it. They're good. You're great. I haven't looked at it for awhile so, but in that aren't a lot of these ideas. They're not, it's, it's not, these aren't essentially black and white issues. And when you state them as if they are black and white issues, that's what opens up all these portals of debate and dissent. And there's just quite a few places online where people were upset at you and quite a few things that you've said in these hour long, eloquent pieces that people are vehemently opposed.

Speaker 3:          00:50:28       Yeah. And I'm annoyed that it's not more like really, I'm really, I want Eh, people don't you try to stop them, stop them. Don't you pull videos down, don't you like whole videos for copyright infringement and tell people to not make video? Oh No, no, no, no. Oh, this, sorry. This just recently happened. So yeah, this is a guy who worked at FDR. Um, there was a trial out there who IDR free domain. Main radio. Yeah. So there was a, I'm a guy, I'm going to say trawl is going to poison the well, right. There was a fellow out there I think in the man, a gentleman, oh, have a trolley persuasion. Um, and he, I do these colon chose when people call and we talk about sort of philosophy and ideas and whatever else. And he had gotten some of those calls and it through means I don't pretend to understand.

Speaker 3:          00:51:15       He had, you know, doxing where you, you start revealing people's personal information. He'd got pictures of their kids. He'd found out where they lived. He had just done stuff where he was, um, someone just called in and he got pictures of their kids. What can I tell you what I mean? I do, I do. I can, can I pretend to know why people do this now when this person called in, but I want to elaborate or sorry to interrupt, but with these people being threatening with a, criticizing you and some sort of an, oh, I know, I, I think we were just having a conversation about something, trying to get this information about their families. Well, so, so I, let's say I call someone named Barb called in. Okay. And then, um, someone took that slice of our conversation and work like crazy to try and find everything out about Bob and then publish videos with pictures of Barb and pretty personal.

Speaker 3:          00:52:04       So everybody uses my staff and I don't care about it. And you're going to do a search on youtube for my staff and everybody and everybody who said, I'd really like to reuse your stuff. I'm like, Hey, go for it. Right. But we had a number of listeners who called in and said, listen, this guy's doing some pretty creepy stuff with my personal info here. It, I'm not comfortable with it. So we use that mechanism to take that down. It's got nothing to do with copyright or anything like that. I just felt that listeners were being acted against in a negative way, significantly negative ways. So that's what we did. But it's nothing to do with copyright or anything like that and people, people use my stuff all the time. That's incredibly bizarre. So this was, was this a scare tactic to threaten people that were criticizing you was no, no, it, it's, it's a scare tactic to try and get people to not call into my shell.

Speaker 3:          00:52:46       Like, so we'll target people who tried to call into your show and then we will start trying to find out personal information about them and so on. And it's only one or two people and it's only happened once, but that's why we did that. Uh, that's why, uh, Mike decided to do that thing on youtube, which I fully agree with. I think it's a terrible use of uh, uh, of time and it's a negative thing to do and someone else but people, I mean if I was, if I was interested in, in, in taking down people's who use my stuff, then why on earth would there be so many of my videos re posted all over youtube. Do you think that maybe part of the problem with your perception, your Po, the public perception of you is that you don't engage in these kinds of conversations where you're allowed to elaborate on your question on things and

Speaker 2:          00:53:26       people get to see a more nuanced perspective on what do you mean big instead of this like hour long echo chamber where you do these videos, he just, it's your thoughts. Bang, Bang, Bang, Bang, Bang. Thank you. Good night. W you know, it's like, uh, there's a, there's a bit that I've done about on stage where like it's, it's amazing that you can get someone to sit down and listen to you talk for an hour because most of the times when people are talking it's, they're having a conversation. It's a very unnatural form to have like, uh, uh, like a long rant or a lecture. It's a fairly recent thing in human history, right? And that most of the times when people are talking for an hour, you're like far, I got some shit to say to. And that's isn't that what's kind of going on with a lot of the criticism against you?

Speaker 2:          00:54:12       I do six to seven hours of colon shows a week. Right? So I am not like a, it's not like a one way street in what it is that I do. Right. And we've had a standing policy for I think three years that if you have a criticism of me, you go to the front of the line. I mean, we were booking people into the winter now who want to talk on this show on unfree to main radio. Uh, people are booked up until November, but if you have a criticism of me, you get to the front, you bump everyone, you get to the front of the line. So as far as people who have issues with me or disagree with things that I say, you'll have better reason than evidence. Fantastic. I mean, I've done entire shows, what I've read out, somebody's criticisms of media and things that I got wrong and all that.

Speaker 2:          00:54:54       I am very open to correction. Lord knows, I mean I'm at one human being with some researchers and all that, so yeah, make mistakes are made and I've admitted to mistakes that I've made in researching and so on, but if people want to tell me that I'm doing something wrong or want to debate with me, they get to the very front of the line every time. But they just never really show up. But it's not necessarily things that you're getting wrong. It's people disagreeing with positions that you have that it's, you can't say it's right or wrong, but these are very strong positions that you have. For one. There's a video of, you were talking about being an, you consider yourself an an arco capitalist that the best way to describe it, and you were telling people that if they weren't, if their friends were not also a narco capitalists, they should abandon those friends.

Speaker 2:          00:55:43       They should cut those friends out of their lives. I don't think I've ever said there's one time in sort of an eight year show history where I said to someone, I think you need to not have these people in your life. And that's because he was suicidal. But there is a principle that is I think really important, right? And it is part of a long term conversation that you have with people. So let's say that, uh, I like to smoke marijuana. Let's just go out on a limb here and say, I like to smoke marijuana. Now, people who support the war on drugs literally do support me being thrown in jail for the peaceful activity of smoking marijuana. Now that's a very real thing. People who

Speaker 3:          00:56:24       support the war on drugs to support me being thrown in jail. And that is a pretty aggressive thing to have around you. Now, this doesn't mean, oh, you disagree with me, I'm never going to talk to you again. I talk all the time to people who disagree with me, but I will say that in my very personal relationships, in sort of my close friends and family and so on, I really can't it myself. I can't get past this idea that I have. If I have people in my life who say, staff, if you disagree with me about the welfare state, I think the welfare state is a complete disaster and incredibly destructive to the poor. Then you must pay the taxes for the welfare state. Or I support you being thrown in jail. Or if people are pro the war in Iraq, I would say, I mean I'm Canadian, but let's say I was in America.

Speaker 3:          00:57:06       And if people say to me, Steph, I think you should be thrown in jail for not supporting the war in Iraq. Well that would be a pretty aggressive action for somebody to sort of eyeball you and say, yes, people should come and throw you in jail. Were God awful things are going to happen to you. That to me is a very aggressive and very real thing that happens. And if you are committed to a belief system, then in the long run, again, this is not a short term scenario, and I've done speeches, full speeches, there's one in Liberty Apia 2010 where I've sort of go into this in more detail, but if you are committed to something, like let's say you're against racism, which is of course a wonderful thing to be against at some point, if you got friends in the KKK, you gotta make a choice.

Speaker 3:          00:57:44       You have to make a choice. If you say, well, I really want the friends in the KKK, then fine, then you're just not that much of an antiracist, right? I get it. Right? But if you say, well, I want to be a committed antiracist and I want to maintain my friendships in the KKK, this kind of a problem, right? So it's, and, and so I say, look, if you want to hang around with a bunch of people who want you thrown in jail for following your conscience, do it. That's completely fine, but don't say that you're committed to the belief system then. Right? If you are committed to the belief system, this is going to be a collision at some point. I mean, I don't, that's not something I'm making up. That seems to me to be pretty true, but that's sort of where people get upset.

Speaker 1:          00:58:18       I don't think that's very controversial. I think what you're saying is very reasonable. It makes a lot of sense. But the video that I saw was you talking about people that support the state saying that if you support the state, you support people that want you dead. These are exactly what laws the state wants you dead. That's what laws are though. If you disobey laws and you resist police officer, but wow, sword it from you. Which laws are you talking about? I mean this state encompasses a broad range of laws that range from traffic lights too. You know what I mean? There's a lot going on there. Supporting the state mean if you're not in a narco capitalist, you support the state and you were saying that you should cut those people out of your life. Anyone who supports the state, I mean that is a incredibly generalized position,

Speaker 3:          00:59:05       but you're boiling down like a, I gave you a sort of very compressed

Speaker 1:          00:59:08       did there right now, but in the video that I watched, it's you, you're, you were going on and on about cutting people out of your life that support the state and essentially this idea of

Speaker 2:          00:59:22       this philosophy that you have about how to live life being the one that these people should have spouse and everything else is dangerous and you should cut these people out of your life. Well, was that at the end of me making the argument? I mean, if that's sort of, if, if somebody just takes out of the tail end, right? So I sort of gave you the argument here that if you're an antiracist at some point you got to stop hanging with the KKK people or give up on your anti racism. I mean that's so, uh, it calling it the state is such a, it's such a crazy term. It's such a broad term saying that anyone who supports the state, you need to cut out of your life. What does, there's no, you're not, you don't feel that way. So should I play the video so you can listen to what it is that you said would be? Probably because I'm sort of trying to tie him up to 3000 records or whatever, but yeah, that's here. Okay. Let's see. Can you a I s I emailed it to you, right Jamie, let's, uh, cause uh, it's a fascinating clip and I think you elaborating on it and enlightened or illuminates rather, your positions are these things and it's hot. It's easy to like say something in a rant and then have people go and all sorts of different directions with it. So it's, uh, let's listen to what it says

Speaker 4:          01:00:38       by this time tomorrow, you call up the people, you know, when you say, I've got a question to ask you, I know it's going to be uncomfortable, then you know something about my beliefs. And I don't mean to put you in the, uh, put you on the spot, but you kind of got a gun against my temple. So I just want to talk about that. I know we've talked a lot about all the abstract things in the universe, but I want to ask you a question directly and it's better to talk to people face to face. It's harder to point a gun at somebody face to face even.

Speaker 5:          01:01:05       Yeah,

Speaker 4:          01:01:05       in an abstract manner. I talked to them face to face, go sit down with them at a coffee shop and say, so I just want to understand the basis of our relationship. So you claim to have some affection from me, some love for me, some respect from me or whatever. And you assume that something positive for the relationship and you say to them, sitting across from them, you say, excuse me. You say, do you support the use of violence against me?

Speaker 5:          01:01:31       Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:01:32       And they all of course. No, of course not. It's like, oh, okay. So then we're on the same ground. So you don't support the use of violence just against me or do you support the use of violence against everyone except me. I was like, no, I don't support the use of violence against anyone. It's like, well then you must be an anarchist or at an ACO capitalist or voluntary as to whatever the hell you must be. A philosopher gonna speak basically decent and they say, well, no, I don't want to. I still believe in the state. I still believe in taxation. I still believe in government. I still believe in front Paul. Okay, well then you do support the use of violence against me. They will do whatever they can to disconnect these two things, theory and practice so they can get all the emotional comforts of conformity with the theory. None of the emotional discomforts of actually advocating somebody getting shot, which people that others are totally uncomfortable with, but don't let them have their cake and eat it too. It's not because you're mean. That's just reality. If you support me getting shot, at least have the courage, the balls to look me in the eye and say, staff, I support you. Getting shot and then I can get you the fuck out of my life.

Speaker 4:          01:02:43       Cause how can I have even a shred of self esteem, a shred of pride in my own existence if I'm willing to hang out with people who want the shot that's sick. That is how the basement self grovelling self denigration of the most revolting. Well I know that you want to be shocked but uh hey can I maybe get a little more meatloaf?

Speaker 4:          01:03:24       And if we're not willing to do that, like if we're not willing to put our personal relationships to the test, if we're not willing to do that, if we're not willing to do that, that's fine. Nobody has to do anything. But don't imagine you have anything to do with libertarianism. And I'm don't imagine that you have anything to do with third that you are using these ideas to play as a clever card to play the cool car, to play the alternative card to play the I am smarter and know more than you and I'm out of the Matrix and you're in the Matrix and we play all this nonsense. Don't try and use philosophy. Don't try and use philosophy. Don't try and use ethics for your own personal comfort and to feel superior and avoid the anxiety of asking people that basic central question, which you yourself bring up, you yourself bring this question up that our taxation of violence as the initiation of use of what you bring it up. Other people don't bring this to the conversation you bring into the conversation. So do it. Bring it to the conversation.

Speaker 5:          01:04:20       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:04:21       Okay. I think we got the gist of it there. Yeah. I didn't tell anyone to leave anyone. I said if you are committed to the nonaggression principle then, and I said at the beginning, I said, we've talked about these things many times before, so this isn't sort of like the first time you sit down and chat with someone when it takes a long time to have these conversations. It took me years to get anywhere useful in philosophy. So yeah, I mean I, I'm always sort of curious about, you know, people say, oh this is terrible stuff that you said, not that you were saying that, oh this is really controversial stuff that you said. And then they play it and we're like, did I say something really crazy? And then I watch it? I'm like, yeah, like I still believe even more of that now than I did. This is probably back in 2008 because I want you dead. This is my problem with it. The state doesn't want you dead. The state wants order over 350 million people. They want to figure out how to keep schools in

Speaker 1:          01:05:17       roads, in order law enforcement in order. That's, that's what they're trying to do. They might be doing a really shitty job of it, but the idea that they want you dead, it's, they don't want their population dead. If everyone was dead, there'd be no money. There'd be no live to be no civilization. It's not. It's, it's, in my opinion, that's not an effective way to phrase that and it's leading misleading, in fact, because it's not, the goal of the state is to kill you. You keep saying the state wants you dead. That's an unfair way of describing their position. No, no.

Speaker 3:          01:05:52       Wasn't describing that. The state wants you dead in that clip. Okay. What I was describing was, um, so again, if I like marijuana and you think I should be thrown in jail for marijuana, then I must comply with the laws that you support or I will get shot. I mean at the base of every law is a gun. I mean that's, that's what the state is. That's how it's different from a restaurant or a the boy scouts or I mean at the bottom of what the state does is again, that it's the initiation of force that is the, the, the upside down pyramid. That restaurant is a bullet. And so when people say, I want the government to do this or the government should do that, what they're saying is that violence, the initiation of violence is how we're going to solve this problem. And that initiation of violence goes against specific individuals.

Speaker 3:          01:06:43       And so if, if you're for the war on drugs and I enjoy using drugs, then you want forced to be used against me. You want people to come and use force against me to prevent me doing my peaceful activity. And that is, I mean stripped of all the rhetoric. And all of the flag waving and all of the Matrix. He stuff that goes on there that were raised with law is an opinion with a gun. That's what government law fundamentally is. And to resist the state is to risk death. I mean we've seen this over and over again.

Speaker 1:          01:07:18       Do you, do you regret saying it the way you said it? Do you think that it could be perhaps said in a, in a way that more illuminates that position rather than this continuing use of this phrase. They want you dead, they want you dead and then you separate from the people that support people that want you dead. Cause that's one of the things that people were worried about with you is that they think that you're, you have this main principle that you bring up about cutting people out of your life, cutting family members out of your life, cutting people out of your life that disagree with your views on the state, cutting people out of your life and disagree. And by doing that you're separating these folks from their friends and that that is the foundation of cults. That that is a big part of cults is that cults separate you from your, your friends that might disagree with the cult, separate you from your loved ones, separate you, your family that may have some sort of a control and bond over you so that the con, the cult can have more control over you.

Speaker 1:          01:08:21       Like this is the, so are you saying I'm running a Celt, is that men on me saying that that is the argument. If I thought you were running a cult, I wouldn't be having a conversation with you. But people, that is a main principle of cults that they separate you from all the descent from their ideas, the, the, anybody that would disagree. Anybody that would be no fear what their control anybody with. So when you're saying things like, like what, why would you say to someone like anybody who agrees with the state cut them out of your life? Like what, what would be the goal of that? Just to try to enhance that person's life to try to say like, look, my advice to you,

Speaker 3:          01:09:00       because Joe, it's a true statement. It's not, it has no sort of effect or intent in that particular thing. It is a true statement. If people are concerned about being separated from families, they should be a hell of a lot more concerned about the war on drugs than anything. Some Internet podcasts is saying, you know as well as I do, how many families are smashed up by the war on drugs, right? So if somebody is for the war on drugs than they are for people getting ripped out of their homes, separated from their children, thrown in prison, that smashes up families. If people are for family cohesion, which you know, I'm married, I have a child and love it. If there for family cohesion, they should be against the military industrial complex, which separates people from their families, sends them overseas, guests them traumatized, has them come back, dumps them back in with very little support into society as a whole.

Speaker 3:          01:09:56       If people are very much into family cohesion, then forcing parents to pay for government schools where parents and children are separated from each other for seven or eight hours a day, that is a significant issue. So I'm sort of a little baffled sometimes when people say, when I, when I say, look, if you're going to take a committed stand on a moral issue, at some point your personal relationships are going to have to become part of that equation. If you now, if you don't want to take a committed stand on a moral issue, that's perfectly fine and I said that right there in the video, you know if then den and give up this philosophy, if if you want to keep your relationships that's perfectly fine, but if you do want to take a moral stand on an issue, then at some point your personal relationships are going to be part of the equation. Otherwise you're kind of a hypocrite, right? You're saying, well this is non aggression principle is really important to me, but all the people who want me thrown in jail for following my conscience, well that's okay,

Speaker 1:          01:10:51       but do they want you thrown in jail just by simply saying that they re they support quote unquote the state? Is that what they're saying? Or they're saying that they want you in jail. They don't want you breaking laws. But did they want you in jail? I mean, are they saying they really want you dead or are they saying that they, they don't think that it's the worst situation ever to have a government?

Speaker 3:          01:11:10       Well, no, but you see again in this, the clip that you, I said, I've talked to [inaudible]. I said, when you sit down with that person, you say, I've talked about this for years, right? Right. So at some point people do have to get down to the essence of what's being talked about when we talk about the state and what is being talked about fundamentally in essence is the initiation of force. It is the only agency in society that is able to initiate the use of force and do that, which is illegal for private citizens to do. And that is a great and deep and I argue terrible power in the world. It gets like,

Speaker 5:          01:11:47       yeah,

Speaker 3:          01:11:47       if I was erm, I don't mean to push and pull the j Chi, but let's just say the j card, the Jewish. Right. So, but let's say that, um, uh, I don't think anybody's ever said that somebody was a, somebody was talking about I'm a Holocaust is not a big deal or who cares. Right. And I this is an extreme example and it's, I mean obviously it's, it's um, contentious. But

Speaker 5:          01:12:17       yeah,

Speaker 3:          01:12:17       at some point if somebody was a holocaust denier and, uh, uh, I would at some point have to say, look, I mean this is really not acceptable. I mean we can't write or I can say, well, I'm not, you know, for reality, your true for Judaism or anything like that anymore. That is the reality of having a committed moral principle. If, if you are in the 18th century and you are for the end of slavery and everyone around you is like, I think slavery is unnecessary and moral institution and you had years of conversation with them about the moral reality and you've shown them the pictures. In the 20th century alone, Joe governments murdered a quarter of a billion human beings, not including war, a quarter of a billion human beings. 250 million human beings were murdered by governments. In the 20th century. That is some serious shit that goes down that is like, I don't even know how many Holocaust.

Speaker 3:          01:13:08       Right? And so people who support the state, and I'm talking about after years of conversation, right? Because it takes a long time to change these paradigms, but at some point if you are committed to a moral goal, then people who are happy or comfortable or positive or pro the initiation of force against you in pursuit of that moral goal. I think that I cannot have people in my life who are going to, after I have explained it and after they have agreed with the general principles, as I said in the, uh, the clip that you just played, I can't have those people in my life. I can't have people in my life who at want me thrown in jail for following my conscience.

Speaker 1:          01:13:49       When you say support the state, you don't want people in your life to support the site. To what end do they dissent? I mean saying you don't agree with war is fairly commonplace yet there's war everywhere saying you don't agree with taxes. Pretty much. Most Americans don't agree with the current tax structure, but what are the options? I mean by saying you don't agree with them, that's all you require or do you require

Speaker 2:          01:14:12       action like by saying you don't support the state, nothing gets done. There's nothing different. If you don't pay your taxes, you will get thrown in jail. You will get in trouble. And what happens if you resist? You get thrown in jail. What happens if you resist the people who come to throw you in jail probably shoot you. That's what I'm talking about. No ones. Even if you don't support that, like what do you do? What do the doing pot well that's doing everything because otherwise you're just saying you don't support it but you are supporting it. Right. You know by saying do you support the state? If you send in your tax dollars, you support the state. If you follow the laws, you do support the state. I mean you are essentially, yeah. No, I mean they're bidding but that's the, I think that's using the, you know, if, if a slave doesn't run away, he doesn't support slavery.

Speaker 2:          01:14:59       Reminisce recognizes who has the whip. But if you're saying that you're going to cut people out of your life that support the state, to what extent do you have to not support the state? I mean, what if you're paying taxes, you're supporting the state. If you're following the laws, you're essentially supporting the state. You're falling laws that you don't agree with, right? Like when someone says, I don't support the state, what the fuck does that even mean? I mean, come on Joe. I mean someone who's in a concentration camp is not supporting the regime even if they're not fighting it. So are we all in a concentration camp just paying the tax? I'm analogizing that obedience to force is not supported. I understand that of force, right? I pay my taxes, I obey all the law. Right? But then the descent of though that obedience, the disallowing of the state or the disapproving rather of the state.

Speaker 2:          01:15:44       Like what? To what extent do you require to maintain a friendship? All I all I require for friendships with me. All they require is for somebody to say, I do not support the use of force against you for a piece of, of activities. That's all I require. They don't have to do anything. They don't have to join a march. They don't have to chain themselves to an IRS officer, haven't anything like that. All I require is for people to say, I do not want you shot for following your conscience. I reject the use of force against you for peaceful activities. That's it. That's the magic key to the Kingdom of me. Well, that, that's all very, very reasonable. And in saying that, but also saying that you, you also are following the laws, you're still sort of supporting the state, aren't you? Yeah. Again, we're back to this question of support.

Speaker 2:          01:16:30       I don't think that enforced compliance could be considered since support. Otherwise, you know? Right. There's no such thing as rape because if the woman's not fighting back, right. Obviously it's, you know, a terrible situation. So now I just, all I requires for people to say it is coercion and I, I think it's wrong that that's all. I mean nobody has to do anything. Uh, because I think that once everybody gets that, then evil is a very tough thing to fight because most people like once, once someone identify something as evil, it's usually done. Like what? Once immorality is clear to people, it's usually over and done with. Like that's why nobody says let's

Speaker 3:          01:17:10       get bring back slavery because everybody recognizes what a social immorality it is. So it has no power, which had huge power throughout most of history. Slavery now has no power all let's say, let's take away the rights of women. Now nobody suggests that cause it would be wrong, but it was format a lot of history. That was how a lot of societies function. So once people see immorality for what it is, it loses all of its power and society fundamentally changes. That's why all I want is for people to see what I call the gun in the room. That when people are talking about the state, they are at the bottom talking about the use of violence in the initiation of violence. When people, if people see that, then that is, I think that and peaceful parenting is the very best way to bring about a peaceful change. Revolution suck. I mean, I think maybe three times in human history they ended up with something better and most times it's just terrible. And, um, and of course most people who do follow the state follow the state just as I did and, and prove approve of and appraisal state because that's how they're raised. And that's, you know, so it takes years of conversations to change people's minds. But at some point, you know, again, committed to all people have to say is they reject the use of force against me. And um, that's great. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:18:22       I think that the issue that people have with it is this is the stern stance of cutting folks out of your life. I mean that seems to come up over and over again in the criticisms of you is this idea of cutting family members out of your life, cutting your parents out of your life. And that, you know, even people that have thought that they had happy relationships with their family, you don't believe they're happy relationships and you don't believe that these, these people, you, you essentially have talked about childhood in a lot of folks as being like a prison.

Speaker 3:          01:18:54       Well, I mean technically it kind of here's my daughter can't, can't go anywhere. It's not wrong. It's just that, you know, she's completely dependent on me and she has no rights. She has no economic independence and someone, so that's more a biological description of dependence rather than, it's terrible like a government prison.

Speaker 1:          01:19:10       Hmm. Yeah. I don't think I would ever describe it as a prison. I think I would more describe it as someone developing and more of like, you know, a scenario where you're mentoring and raising them and protecting them and then slowly nurturing them to the point with her

Speaker 3:          01:19:27       pendant. Yeah. I mean, I considered that prison. No. And I can't remember if and where and when I've said anything like that. But I mean I obviously I'm a parent and, and I'd been a stay at home parent for five and a half years now. And you've caught

Speaker 1:          01:19:40       parents out, your wife has cut her parents out and you've, you've recommended this to many other folks.

Speaker 3:          01:19:46       No, no, no, no, no, no. I haven't. No, I didn't recommend it in that. I say there are consequences to holding certain beliefs. Right? And if you want to keep people in your life who had destructive towards you, that's absolutely your choice. But then don't say you're against destruction. That's all. If you want to keep, and this is, um, the consequences of beliefs. I've really, really want people to take philosophy seriously. Don't want it to be like a dilettante's science. I don't want it to be a a or habit. I mean, when you hold moral beliefs, they have very serious, very, very important. And that's how things change in the world is people who take their moral beliefs incredibly seriously and are willing to go to the wall for them. Yeah. Right? And so if you hold moral beliefs, then, um, they have to inform your relationships. Otherwise, it's pretty hypocritical. Now, if you want to hang onto your relationships, as I've said millions of times before, fantastic, then recognize that you don't really hold those beliefs. That's fine. No one can tell anyone what to do in that regard. But if you hold the beliefs, they have consequences in your life. Otherwise they're just noise. They're just talk.

Speaker 1:          01:20:48       So essentially what you're saying is that your idealistic view, your Utopian view must be in somehow acted upon. And that if you have this idea of what is correct, what is morally correct, what is ethically correct, what is the, the best way to live your life? If there are any impediments to that, that you're enforcing or even nurturing, you need to remove them from your life? The impediments to progress. I think there's, there's, there's, there's a certain amount of real, there's a certain amount of momentum that we were raised with. Um, I think many of us, I mean, I can give you my own personal example. We were raised by people who were raised by people who really didn't know much. And a lot of how we developed and a lot of how we were, we're taught around the home was by people that really didn't, they weren't aware of the consequences of their actions.

Speaker 1:          01:21:43       They're essentially acting in the momentum of how they were raised and, and also what is convenient. They're working all day, they're tired. They want you to shut the fuck up. And so they yell at you to shut the fuck up. And is it that they're evil or is it that they didn't really know what the fuck they were doing? You know? And I think that taking a stand to do things differently is incredibly important. And if you have grandparents or parents or whatever that are destructive to the, to your children, or they give your children, put bad thoughts in their heads or teach them that what you're saying is incorrect and that this, these ethics and morals that you're teaching them that you feel so strongly about or in fact against the Bible, or I could see cutting those types of folks out of your life.

Speaker 1:          01:22:27       I honestly can see that, but I think people have a problem with you saying it because you're so charismatic because you're so eloquent. Because when I hear someone talk that talks better than me, I assume that person's smarter than me. I want to listen to that person more than one to listen to my own mind because most people's minds are filled with doubt and insecurity, and it's one of the reasons why colt cults get formed in the first place. If someone can talk clearly and confidently, and I say this with all knowledge that I've been accused of fucking starting my own cult, all right, I'm not, I'm not any sort of a leader whatsoever. What I am is entirely

Speaker 3:          01:23:06       a person who is curious and who asks questions. And I give advice based on what I've learned about myself. And I tried to be as open and honest about all my flaws and all the mistakes that I've made totally in the, in the interest of disclosure so that other people can learn from the mistakes that I've made without having to make them yourself. But I think that when people hear that this idea of cutting people off, d fooling as you call it, cutting people off, it makes them nervous. Why? Because that's why the polls, it's principal directive about cults. It's not, it's not, that's the why of your life. No, no, isn't it though? Listen, isn't the thing, let me ask you this, Joe, do you think that a woman who's being abused by her husband should stay or leave? No. Stay. She should stay?

Speaker 3:          01:23:52       No, of course. No. She said leave. Yes, of course. Yes. So, um, why is it any different between adult children and their parents? No, you're right. You know, if your parents abuse you, I absolutely 100% whole heartedly agree. If you had an abusive asshole parents, you should cut them off. And furthermore, I strongly suggest, and I've been to therapy myself and I think it's a wonderful discipline. Uh, if you get a great therapist, I have consistently said, if you have problems with your parents, sit down with them and talk about them. Screw the philosophy, screw this. You know, all this other stuff we've been talking about the state and so on, right? If you have issues with your parents, like if they beat you up or if they never paid any attention to you, sit down and talk with them and air your grievances because you have to be honest in relationships.

Speaker 3:          01:24:37       If you're going to have a relationship, I agree and have conversations with them and talk with them. If the abuse escalates, if it gets worse, try and continue to have the conversation until you just can't take it anymore. If you're considering family separation, talk to a therapist. It's, and don't do it without a therapist has been my consistent mantra for eight years. Go Talk to a therapist, uh, and, and make sure a therapist reviews the whole situation with you, goes with you through the whole process. Now that's a heck of a lot more than women who are being abused by their husbands usually get in terms of advice, right? But, um, as far as I know, it, uh, the people who have left their families have done so under the care of a therapist, which I think is really essential and important because it is a challenging thing to do.

Speaker 3:          01:25:18       And Fss said at the beginning of the show, I mean, it's all about principles. It's all about the extension of principles. Women who were abused by their husbands chose those relationships for bad reasons, obviously, and probably for own personal histories of abuse as children and so on. Women who chose their husbands are in those relationships voluntarily and can leave at any time and have massive support systems around in the world to leave. Now when you're a child, you really can't leave your parents, right? I mean, that's why I was, I think half jokingly referred to it as like a prison because you can't leave. You can't get out. Now, if you were abused by your parents when you're a child, you couldn't leave. You couldn't get out. I mean, where are you going to go? And so then you become an adult and the behavior has not reformed and the parents are still negative or difficult or abusive. Absolutely. Sit down and air your grievances with them. If they continue to be abusive, you don't have to stay.

Speaker 1:          01:26:12       Well, how do you define abuse of though what? What is abusive? I mean, there's a broad range of many would consider abusive.

Speaker 3:          01:26:19       There are, um, so, uh, minor little pitch here. Um, the FDR [inaudible] dot com slash bib is my presentation on the bomb in the brain where I go through what's called the adverse childhood experiences, which is a test developed by Dr. Vincent Felitti, who's also been on my show. And I think it's a nine or 11 part questionnaire about things that you experienced as a child that are considered to be a abusive, uh, so being beaten, uh, not receiving proper medical care or food or shelter, um, and living with a family member who was incarcerated or mentally ill or addicted to various substances and so on. So, um, there is a pretty objective questions out there. You know, how comprehensive I didn't develop them. I haven't, obviously you vetted them compared to what I don't do. Excuse me. I don't know. But there are sort of standards out there by which people can sort of find out to some degree whether or not they have, uh, uh, experienced abuse as a child.

Speaker 1:          01:27:16       This, but this practice of [inaudible], um, this is, I mean, it's pretty widely criticized, right? I mean, your wife got in trouble for this, for advocating this on your, on your show, right? No, she didn't. No, didn't, she gets suspended and she'd have no, none of that is true. So that's just lies she online.

Speaker 3:          01:27:35       Yeah. None of it. That is true. She was never suspended, have practice continued. They had some questions about the podcast and in the end of it they said, listen, we thought that maybe you had been given advice without giving a full, um, uh, psychological question or workup.

Speaker 1:          01:27:50       The quote that I had wrote and written down was that she had been told her statements are in, uh, in support of deferring or not supported by current professional now or consistent with a,

Speaker 3:          01:28:03       that was in the complaints. The final result was that a defunding is perfectly consistent with best psychological practices.

Speaker 1:          01:28:11       So this was just in the complaint. So people are taking this out of context. Can you believe it? Something that it's being taken well, that's very illuminating, then that makes people feel a lot better. Um, because that, that, that mean that is the one thing that people consistently have issue with a lot of the teachings of you and your,

Speaker 3:          01:28:33       well, let's, let's look at it this way. Right? So in, in the 60s, I'm sorry to drop it. In the 60s, there was, I mean, it's great. I'm really, I appreciate you bringing all this stuff up. I mean, because it's interesting stuff. So, um, in the 1960s, uh, feminists and I think really great feminists came along and said to women, don't put up with abuse. Right? I had this, a woman on my show, she's a, uh, Aaron [inaudible] or she, she created the a woman's shelter, uh, in, in England and women would come beaten up and broken down to her shelter. And everybody was appalled. Absolutely appalled until death do us part was the mantra, right? Uh, that you can't leave your husband no matter how abusive, no matter how terrible, no matter how drunk and no matter how, what effort. Right.

Speaker 5:          01:29:26       Okay.

Speaker 3:          01:29:26       And she basically said, well, I don't think that's right. I think that you should not stay in abusive relationships. Now, if the only people you ever talked to with the husbands, the abusive husbands that these women had left, what would they say about this woman? Yeah, no, I see your point. It's not the children, it's not the adult children who are complaining about this. It's the parents. Well, my mom, what you, I mean, what would you expect?

Speaker 3:          01:29:52       I mean if you promote volunteerism in relationships and then people go to a therapist and um, you know, like I was a, I think I kind of hope 2000 and whatever it was years and years ago, there was some write up in the newspapers, a about some guy who left his family. He was a therapist, was helping him through the whole process and the therapist was recommending it and the therapist was the one who was helping him through the process. But somehow it's the podcast in Canada that is the sole cause of all this stuff.

Speaker 1:          01:30:22       Well, I certainly think there's arguments for cutting people out of your life, whether it's a fee, a sister or a brother or a mother or father, they are abusive people that you are unfortunately just given a relationship with. You don't choose them. They are just a part of your life. And I think it certainly can be argued that an engineered life where you choose the people in your life, when you choose the positive influences that you have can be more rewarding, more satisfying, more beneficial than being committed to this blood is thicker than water bullshit where you have a bunch of people in your life that are fucking assholes. Um, I think that

Speaker 1:          01:30:59       in illuminating it like this and speaking about it in this sort of a form where you get a chance to go back and forth with someone, people will get a better idea of your point of view and your perspective on it. And it's really easy to look at what you've said and say, oh, this guy's fucking starting a call. This guy's telling people, cut everybody out. If you don't, if you support the state, cut them out of your life. Cut everybody out. If, uh, if you, if your mom, you know, yelled at you to do your homework and called you a loser, cut her out of your life. Everybody cut out. Come to me, send me your money. Get in my inner circle. I need about 50 bucks a month come to come to my house. We're going to have POW wows when I sit around the campfire and I'll wax eloquently while you all stare and

Speaker 3:          01:31:42       I, uh, I will give you access to the basement of fertile women and then everything will be set there in the basement. Yeah. No, I mean, look, it's a podcast. I'm making arguments, right? Every philosopher throughout history, and I'm not trying to put myself in such illustrious company, but every philosopher throughout history has accused of corrupting the young, right? I mean, that's, if you're not accused of that, you're just not even in the remotely. Right. You're not trying hard enough. Yeah. You're just not, not doing hard labor.

Speaker 1:          01:32:08       Zero lazy philosopher and, um, well, it's, sorry, go ahead. No, I'm sorry. It was just, there is, without a doubt, there's problems with the society at large and many of the problems are because it has not been engineered in a, a very ethical or moral way. It's been engineered out of convenience and it's been engineered out of momentum. It's been engineered by the ignorance of the past. That's it.

Speaker 3:          01:32:34       It's just history. It's industry, right? It's just what we've inherited. [inaudible] we've got this brain that's like, you know, it's like the lizard bit and then there's like a bit above the list or if that's an amphibian and then we've got this monkey and now we're trying to operate on this like post monkey Beta expansion pack of the frontal Cortex, which is all layered on crap and it's, you know, it's kind of unwieldy. We, you know, we evolved from some pretty primitive lifeforms and it's not like that stuff's all vanished, which is actually quite a good thing then.

Speaker 1:          01:32:59       Well all these discussions and these conversations in these heated debates, what they essentially do is they bring up very important points and they allow people to give opinions and bounce ideas back and forth. And that's very important. And that's one of the major things that society benefits from when it comes to philosophy.

Speaker 3:          01:33:22       Well, I certainly hope that is the case and I'm very much into a consistency and I was raised that if you're in abusive relationships, you should leave them. That's how I was raised. I mean because I saw that all the time. You know the movie of the week, the woman in peril, the husband is a creep and and she just gets out.

Speaker 1:          01:33:38       Why do you think there's been this blow back against you then? Why do you think people take these clips out of context? Put them up and make it look like? Like I've always talked about like I guess jokes are very different because it should be inherently known that when someone's joking that most likely they aren't serious, but people love to take someones jokes, take the words in quotes on and put them down in text form completely out of context. And some of the things that people say look absolutely horrible because of that and that that's not exactly what they're doing with you, but they're doing their, they're trying to label you in a certain way and trying to label you as a destructive influence. Why do you think that is? Well, I think I am at destructive implements to them, to their interests, but is it the interest of who is the interest of the state interest of the family?

Speaker 1:          01:34:28       A lot of these folks are not, they don't care about me. You don't know what I'm saying? A lot of these folks, they might, if you keep getting bigger, see, we'll see. It'll be happy. One day of the state cares about you. You've made it. Oh yeah, that's right. Hey look, Lazarus. Yay. I the ride. I've arrived, I'm sweating. Um, but what, why do you think that these folks who've left and start these blogs against you and all this nonsense? Like what or where she didn't say nonsense, all this criticism. What do you think that's about?

Speaker 3:          01:34:55       Well, I think that, um, the of volunteerism in any relationship harms the interest of those who are relying on things other than volunteerism. God, that's a bad way of putting it. Does that even make any sense? A little bit? Okay. So let's say that, um, I don't know. Let's say that the UFC has issues in New York with a union. You probably never heard of anything like this, but let's say, let's say that the UFC has a, has problems with a union, right? I mean, don't you have to go to New Jersey to see a UFC? Like you can't go to New York and, and, and why? So why, why is this union now so negative towards the UFC?

Speaker 1:          01:35:35       Well, I'll give you the full details. It's the culinary union. The reason why the culinary union is against the UFC and the UFC is owned by [inaudible] Zoo for the parent company of the UFC, also own station casino station casinos. There's 20 plus station casinos and they are non union. So the Culinary Union does not control them. They don't reap benefits and rewards and money from them. It would be worth upwards of, according to many sources, more than $15 million a year. So they spend an exorbitant amount, exorbitant amounts of money to make the UFC look terrible, to highlight anything that any fighter says that's politically incorrect and harp on it and pay off politicians to keep it out in New York state. That's the last place where it's illegal. But it's also just New York is a deeply rooted, corrupt institution. I mean it's, it's showing it, I mean, some of the people that have commented on the UFC, they have done so with complete disregard to the truth, to the facts of the competition itself, to the, the, the laws and the regulations and the safety record of the UFC. I mean, they're distorted perceptions are distorted depictions rather of the mixed martial arts. I've been just grossly inaccurate and willfully and they've done so because they were being paid to do that.

Speaker 3:          01:36:54       Right? Yeah. So something that UFC is doing is to their perception negative to their interests and therefore they become very hostile towards the, uh, the UFC. Now this doesn't mean that everyone who's upset with me is in this category. I'm sure there's many legitimate reasons to, to have a negative opinion of me. But, uh, I think that the people who are the most upset of the people who, um, their, their adult children listened to my show. And I said, I'm just, as everyone has been telling women for 50 years, I said, you don't have to put up with abuse, but you should sit down, talk with your parents, and you should get a therapist if you're going to think about separating.

Speaker 1:          01:37:29       So you think it's just people that are like the parents of these people that are separating, that are pissed off at you because you're challenging the rule that they have over their children.

Speaker 3:          01:37:37       I know a lot of the people, uh, who, uh, have, uh, um, who have a websites. In fact, one of them was even on my show and I'm, so, it's not a huge mystery to me as to what their identity is. Now, the other thing to remember is that I don't have a lot of shows about this. I've done 3000 shows of which three or four have been me talking about this topic, right? So this is not any kind of central focus of what it is. It's just if people ask me where the principles apply, I have to say where I think the principles apply and I have to provide my arguments. So I does not a big topic for me. I understand. Of course it's a big topic for other people and so if you have, um, if you are a parent and your child has had significant issues with you, that child has grown up, that child has listened to me and they have sat down. Like if I have any influence over someone, then what they should do that say is do what I say, which is sit down, talk with your parents, try and work things out. Remember that adult relationships are voluntary and engage with the therapist. If you're thinking of separating, like if people listen, if people listen to me then that's what they'll do.

Speaker 3:          01:38:43       But if people aren't listening to me, then don't claim I have any influence. Like if somebody just says, well I listened to three podcasts and I walked right out of my family, then that's not me. And because they're not doing what I recommend then. Right. So if I have influence by definition, then the onus shifts to the parents and the therapist. Right. Because that's what I'm saying. Go talk to your parents and engage with the therapist. If you're thinking of family separation, it's what I did. And so if I have influence, then it shifts to the parents because people are quote to doing what I tell them to do and go on to talk to their parents. And then the owners shifts to the therapist because I say go and don't do this. Don't even think of doing any of this without a therapist. I'd recommend that in divorce and stuff like that too. I think it's beneficial in those situations. So the people who have hate ons, well I mean they, if

Speaker 1:          01:39:27       there's not like a hard on with hey is it's your own term, they giant foreskin of horror. But say your own term. Hate on hate on, I guess so. Yeah. I don't know Jamie. All right. If you've got a raging hate on wow, how does one rage with the heat on?

Speaker 3:          01:39:43       So I dunno, but I assume it involves thigh high leather boots and acts on the nipples and stuff like that. But, um, yeah, so if, if your kids came to you when they were adults and they say, listen, I had all these problems and you didn't listen and you got angry and you escalate and they went to a therapist and the therapist said, wow, this is a really toxic relationship. You should try and get out. Well, is it easier? They can't even find the therapist? Probably Ryan, who's the easiest person to target and by definition, if they're just pouring hate and vitriol on me, is it really that surprising as to why their kids might not want to be in their lives? Like if this is what they do in response to a challenge, it's they just create hate sites and pour all this venom and scour around and manipulate and cut things out of context and like then maybe this is something to do

Speaker 1:          01:40:28       do with why their kid signed in their lives. I think as this thing went down with Adam Carolla and then Adam was criticized by Anna and Anna was criticized by you. I think part of the issue is when people communicate in essentially an echo chamber, there's one person talking for long periods of time and you could take any one of those chunks and decide this is something you want to highlight and out of the context of the entire, you might be able to manipulate it and make it look in a way that it's entirely negative. Your position. However, what you're saying now on this podcast, obviously I haven't listened to all your shows. I've seen many of your things online, but I haven't listened to. I quite honestly, I don't think I've ever listened to any of your positions on d fooling with your family. I think

Speaker 2:          01:41:14       anything I was talking about it that much. Everything I've gotten from is just communicating with you and then reading the criticisms of it. But your position on this podcast, I think it's very difficult to argue. I think it's very reasonable. It's very, and if I've done wrong, if people can tell me, but then the problem is it has to go to everyone. Then I just, I can't slice and dice ethics. I'm so sorry Jeff. I was just, uh, I, I've never really had a chance to talk about this kind of stuff and I don't really address it, but I'm excited to be able to, I'm glad we're talking about it because I think it's important sometimes to give people an opportunity. Like I've had people email me, like, why are you friends with Stefan Molyneux? That guy's a dick. And I'm like, like Peter Joseph fucking very upset at you. Peter Joseph the PJ. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:41:56       I liked that guy. I think he's got some great ideas, but he was very upset with you as well. Um, but whatever, that's not important. Um, I think that it's important to have these kinds of conversations. I think I need to have them too, with people to where I go over my own ideas. You know, when you have someone disagree with you, when you get a chance to look at your position from a different angle as well, and look at the perceptions of your positions, you know, one of your positions to get criticized, or one of the other things that gets tossed at you as the term misogynist. And I'm sure that's, uh, that's upsetting to you as well, right? You're not a massage done. Sorry.

Speaker 2:          01:42:31       I don't even like if people could define to me what that, if it means general hatred of all women, that I made a really bad choice of who to get married too. Isn't it

Speaker 1:          01:42:39       though? That's what it besides just means. It's like if, if you criticize anyone who's gay, you're a homophobe. If you have issue with someone who's black who does something stupid like Al Sharpton, you're a racist, you know, it's, it's a cute way of dismembering your argument or dismembering your position right away. But you said some stuff about women that I have even disagreed with and one of them, you did this thing recently. We were talking about how the way to get assholes out of society, it's women's responsibility cause women are breeding with these assholes and they're making,

Speaker 2:          01:43:16       it's the only women's responsibility, right? It's a key part of the equation that I think is not discussed enough, which is the sexual choices of women.

Speaker 1:          01:43:23       That expression or that, that, that sentence is really critical. It's not only women's responsibility, but in what I saw, the thing that you went off on, you were talking, I think it was the Elliot Rogers thing, is that what it was? We were talking about that fucking crazy kid up in Santa Barbara that killed everybody by the way. He killed more men than he did women. It's one of the things that I found fascinating that that soul, yes. All Women Hashtag yes, all women thing came out after four men were murdered in and two women and that guy was a piece of, regardless of gender and gender had very little to do. He was mad at the men that women found attractive. This is not a, it's not an even game, this life, you know, there's people that were born and they look like Beyonce and then there's people that are born that looked like Bridget, the midget and you know, I didn't even know who that is.

Speaker 1:          01:44:09       Is the onsite or bridge of the images. The second one, I dare you pretend you don't know who that is. She's a porn star. Oh yeah. She's a small person. Porn Star. All right, my, but point being, you know, it's, we didn't, it's not like you've earned being beyond size looks, you know, no one earned that. No one worked really hard. She might've worked really hard to get that body, but she's a beautiful person. She was born extremely physically attractive. And if you're voice yes, I mean, you know, good practice forever. Onca sounded like that in this Elliot Rodger Guy was, uh, you know, he was socially awkward and probably mentally there was something wrong with them. Asberger's whatever the fuck it was. I don't know what was wrong with them, but if you watch his videos where he's talking, there's clearly some sort of a weird social disconnect.

Speaker 1:          01:44:54       He had a really hard time connecting with people and, and couldn't, couldn't get a woman to like him for various reasons, blamed them for his hate and is feeling. That's when people see, when they look around, they see all these people that are attractive. They see all these people that are, that are attracted to each other and then they're left out of that. They are frustrated, they're angry. It drives him fucking crazy. And I think that's where this Elliot Rogers guy fit in. And when this, yes, all women thing came about on one hand, I agree with it. I, it's got to be way more difficult to be a woman. Way more difficult to constantly worry about your own physical safety, worry about men wanting to sexually assault you, which is very rare for a man to fear. I mean, maybe in prison, yeah. But in real life it's very rare for men to worry about other men physically, sexually abusing them or wanting to get them somewhere, roofie them up and sexually abused them.

Speaker 1:          01:45:52       But for women, it's a super common occurrence. It's a, women in bars are always worried about covering their drink. I've talked to, it leaves five women over the course of my life that believe or ward definitely roof feed or we're definitely drugged by someone with unknown drug. They woke up in someone's hotel room. It's disgusting and evil and creepy and it's something that men don't have to worry about, but women do. Um, but when a guy like that comes along, I think the, it's not a matter of, it's not a matter of, it's a matter of a mental illness is what it is. I mean that guy, it was a mentally ill person. I don't know what causes a person like that to be mentally ill. But I don't think that women can prevent that by not breeding. I don't think that women can prevent a guy like that from being born.

Speaker 1:          01:46:44       I mean, I don't think his parents were abusive. I've never read anything that said that his parents anything evil to him. So how does an evil guy like that come about is mentally, he's mentally ill. Something happened during his childhood and I don't think anybody could have prevented that by being a woman, not allowing him to have sex with them or whatever. You know, what you were talking about. I think especially in this particular example, that guy was sick. There's something wrong with him. There's sick people all the time. You can go down the street and there's a guy who pushes his car to car talks to himself. And I don't think it's, cause no one fucked him. I think that guy's got something wrong. There's an issue there. And I think that was what this Elliot Rodger Guy, there's an issue with him. That guy was a monster. That guy was an asshole and it's no woman's fault.

Speaker 3:          01:47:27       Well, okay. So let's pull back from Elliot Rodger because we don't know much about his childhood. We know that he had some complaints about the way his step mom treated him. But I went over that in the video. So, so a study came out recently and again, I had the guy on my show to talk about it and what he did was he went to a solid middle class neighborhood and went to a daycare and he said to the women listening, I really want to study aggression, yelling, whatever in families, I need you to wear this recorder before, I don't know, a week or 10 days or whatever it was. And, uh, so he had the women wear this recorder and then he got the footage back or the audio back and he found that the women were hitting the children a lot. A lot like 936 times a year. An average of three times a day from 16 months to four years of age where it was this study. Where is it taking place? Some, I can't remember where, but it was sitting. Yeah. I'll give you the link for, maybe Micah can dig it up. I'll give you the link for the show. 936

Speaker 1:          01:48:36       how many people were involved in the study? I think 40 or so. So it's not comprehensive, but this is a middle class neighborhood conferences and even poor, right. 40 is a pretty good number. And out of those 40 people, what percentage of them were hitting their kids?

Speaker 3:          01:48:48       I think all but two and the other two were verbally aggressive. Whoa. So the idea that women are not part of the cycle of violence to me seems a, and again, this doesn't explain Elliot Rodger of competent, you know, but, but, but the reality is that uh, women and men to like, again, not all women, right? My wife has an incredible mom. Uh, but um, there is a lot of aggression coming from women to towards children. Now it's funny because when people talk about, when I talk about this kind of stuff, people will say, well, what about men? It's like, but we know about men. We need to look at the stuff that's not seen. Right. Because right now it's like, you know, like it's just man at ist and men need to change. Yes, men need to change. Absolutely. Of course men need to change, but saying that women are not part of the cycle of violence is not correct with the data.

Speaker 3:          01:49:39       And I am committed against all calumny, against all insults, against all hates and trolls. I am to doing everything I can to maximize peace in the world. I know that sounds like crappy and diluted and all that, but that is my commitment, you know, in life. And if we can get women to stop hitting children, the world will become a much more peaceful place if we can get men to stop hitting children. Absolutely. But we, the male aggression has already been focused on so much that there is this blind spot, which is the degree to which women use aggression in the raising of children. 80% of British mothers spank their child before the child is one year old. Wow. I mean it's, it's mad centers and those of us who have great wives and peaceful girlfriends and all that, there is a whole world out there of people who, and men and women. But again, we've talked about the mental, I'd focus on the women.

Speaker 1:          01:50:36       Damn it. Well that just dad is very different than what we're talking about. You know, we're talking about is a, is horrific. You know, we're talking about is just, that's any, anytime you're getting a fucking baby that's sick. And the fact that so many people do it is really hard to believe. I don't have any access to any statistics and I believe you. I'm not, I'm not,

Speaker 3:          01:50:59       well again, people can look, I had the, I grilled the guy on my show and a so people can can listen to it. Um, but uh, Mike is going to put it out on Twitter. My Twitter handle this, Stefan Molyneux. Uh, but um, yeah, people can, can look at the study and this is all lots of studies around this study.

Speaker 1:          01:51:14       I'll retweet that study cause that's, that's incredibly disturbing. And when kids, the issue of course is that when kids are hit by their loved ones, they are way more likely to hit their loved ones. They're wearing my Leica, you accept violence. Some of the scariest kids are ever, or kids that were abused at home. And I remember growing up with this kid that was a abused at home and he was so quick to violence and it's, it's super cool. We find it in the UFC as well. Some of the best fighters were bullied when they were younger. They were beaten up by their brothers. Some of the scariest guys or guys who had older brothers used to kick their asses because they get used to having that from their family and their loved ones. And they have a certain tolerance to violence and a certain tolerance to aggression that other folks don't have.

Speaker 1:          01:51:58       They have a peace with it, you know, so they're not as afraid of fighting. They're not as afraid of competition as the other folks are. And um, yeah, that's a, that's a terrible cycle to be a part of. And those numbers are absolutely incredibly disturbing. But that's not exactly what I had read what I had read where you were, you were essentially talking about women's attraction to assholes and that this was the cause of their being more assholes. And if women just stood up and said, they're not going to be with assholes anymore, we wouldn't have any assholes in the world. And I just,

Speaker 3:          01:52:29       well, look, I mean, when, when, when it stated as a completing an isolated absolute, I get that. It sounds do. Right, right, right. And I, you know, I certainly held men's feet to the fire as far as aggression and violence goes as well. And I've talked to dads not to hit their kids and all that. I'm not saying, well, no, I don't need to talk to you. You're the dead. Let me talk to the only person who was ever aggressive to children, which must be the woman. But the reality is, I think, and I think this is somewhat debatable, I think it's fairly well established that in general men ask women out and women say yes or no. That's generally how it works. And there are exceptions and all that, right? But in studies, I've read about 90% of dates or initiated by men. And so women are doing the choosing.

Speaker 3:          01:53:12       And I'm saying to women, one of the ways that women can incredibly contribute to reducing the cycle of violence is to choose better man. Because there's a part of women, and again, this is fairly well established as least as well as these things can be established. There's a part of women that likes the Alpha Guy, right? That the, the guy who's kind of cold and, and efficient and I mean I'm plowing my way through 50 shades of grey. God helped me how to you if you know it, I'm telling you. Oh, you, oh, I'm sorry he's not a midget porn star, but yes, this is all I got. Right? But, um, and I get that, I mean men are attracted to particular physical things which indicate fertility and women are attracted to particular male traits that indicate good provider. And again, there's nothing wrong with any of that.

Speaker 3:          01:53:57       That's perfectly natural. But the reality is that we do need to be wise in who we choose to raise our kids with and who we choose to have kids with. And I berate men all the time for choosing looks over virtue. I mean, on my show, I'm horrendous on men for choosing looks over virtue and we've all been there, we've all done it. And we all know what a mistake then is, right? What is it that someone says, I don't care how good looking she is. There's some guy out there who's tired of screwing her. Right? And so I talked to Matt about don't just go for virtue. You know, virtue is the big tits of philosophy, right? I mean that's what you want to to go for when you're going to get married. And for women, I say the same thing, go for virtue, but I think men's tendency to choose on shallow standards is fairly well known.

Speaker 3:          01:54:42       And again, I'm just trying to sort of shine the light on that other side and say, look, if like you need to sort of cross your legs and grit your teeth and say he may be sexy but he's not a good guy, I'm not going to have kids with him. And I think that will help a lot. I mean, I want to empower women to be like, not to be victims alone, right? I mean I'm trying to empower, once you give people, like if you say, look, women are part of the cycle of violence than women aren't helpless and just need to sit on their knees and beg men not to be violent. Women can actually talk amongst themselves and be empowered to do things, to help reduce the prevalence of violence in society. Choose better men. Don't punish your kids, don't yell at them, don't hit it them reasoned with them. That gives women something to do rather than cross their fingers and hope that men get better.

Speaker 1:          01:55:22       You. Um, you also did this thing on Robin Williams and you do a lot of these, the truth about people and you do these a one hour long pieces where you stare at the camera and explain and I don't even various, yeah,

Speaker 3:          01:55:37       don't even blink. My eyes are so dry. It you, uh, just before, I'm so sorry to interrupt. Um, uh, and we'll get right back to the, go ahead to Robin, but a, so this is from the doctor Phil website. I had this bookmarked and that up. Dr Phil. No, but look, Dr Phil has on his advisory board, all of the top stars, Dr. Phillips in the Bardo who was past head of the APA and all that. So he's got the top guys. And this is what he says. If you were abused, right. And I'll just read the last bit, right. And we can tweet this as well. Um, do what is best for you. Consider the possibility that it may not be healthy to have any sort of relationship with your parents. It's a difficult pill to swallow and it should be used as the last option. However, it may be the option that helps you. The most.

Speaker 1:          01:56:21       Doctor Phil also said that if a man is masturbating to a video, that's just as much of a betrayal as if he had another woman in that room.

Speaker 3:          01:56:30       Actually that's Jesus. Uh, channel and talk to Phyllis. No, but I mean, so that's not his psychological science. Right. But I just know about videos, um, so ahead of his time anyway, so I just wanted this, this question is sort of voluntary family stuff. Uh, you know, people can get mad at Dr Fail, but I'm basically just echoing what I'm, what

Speaker 1:          01:56:48       I think people should get married. A Doctor Phil just for his fucking mustache. How about that? All right. Sorry. Back to, no worries. Um, yeah. About back to Robin Williams. E what are these videos that you do? I think they're very interesting. But to do a biography on someone requires an extensive amount of preparation and massive amounts of research. So when you do the truth and the word the truth is a very tricky thing because there's many truths as many versions. Like I've had conversations with people, they'll say, oh, you know, I heard that this person met this person and that person was an asshole. And I'm like, well, actually I was there and that's not what happened at all. That person was annoying as fuck and the other person was trying to get away from them. And that's why, you know, they looked like an asshole.

Speaker 1:          01:57:34       Um, you did this, the true thing about Robin Williams and your conclusion was that Robin Williams died because of women's addiction to free stuff and that he, he essentially killed himself because of the fact that he owed money because the fact that he spent a lot of money in his, a alimony. Um, I think that's a, I think that's an irresponsible statement because, uh, I think first of all, it may have been a factor. It's certainly was a factor in his unhappiness, but we're not even aware of what kind of behavior he had in those relationships. It was probably also a factor in the breakup of the relationship. Also a factor in the antagonism that he shared with his ex wives if and when, whether or not that did take place, but also his alcoholism, his drug dependency has medical state, the state of the, just the, the natural body and brain chemistry after years and years of abusing drugs and then going back into it and then depression itself. Then on top of that Parkinson's disease. Then on top of that, whatever medication, then he was taken for Parkinson's disease disease, which many have been proven to cause depression in people. So to boil it all down to Robin Williams died because of women's addiction to free stuff. I think that's irresponsible.

Speaker 3:          01:58:58       Well, I'm in and again, I said at the beginning of the video that this is not all set in stone. It's just my, my thoughts, but I think that's a good case to be made. I really do. I mean, because the timing to me is like right after his show was canceled and he's paying $600,000 a year to his first wife from the 80s. I mean that, that's what the settler, he hadn't, he had a prenup with her, but it got thrown out. Right. And um, has prenup get thrown out? How's that work out if the judge thinks it's not reasonable? I mean people sort of, cause people post it back to me and said, well, you should've gotten a prenup. Prenup is not bullet proof. I mean, how many things happened that on Congress is supposed to declare war? How many was this Congress to care like three out of the hundred wars that America has been involved with. It's just part of the law. So a prenup. Um, um, Steven Spielberg's wife, I think Amy Irving, they've been married for four years. They had a prenup and uh, she ended up taking 100 million from him. Yeah. A cell prenup is not a reasonable, yeah. A prenup is not a, it's not a magic. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:59:57       Bullet. Weird. She hasn't worked since one of why lost all over ambition. Denny's probably isn't hiring. So you know, how dare you, she was an accomplished actress, right?

Speaker 3:          02:00:08       And he's a lucky guy. Shelter 20 to 30 million bucks in alimony,

Speaker 1:          02:00:13       so made 200 and something million over the course of his career. He made an insane amount of money, the to the, the fact that he's broke. Um, even if he did have to pay out $30 million, it can't be totally attributed to the fact that his ex wives took an incredible amount of money. It has to be attributed also to poor management of his finances. It has to be attributed to just the overall recklessness that he exhibited in his life. He was a very impulsive guy. As many great comics are, it's a, it's an attribute that many great comics share is this wild, impulsive behavior. I've struggled with it myself. Most of my friends have struggled with it or aren't struggling. They're just fucking embrace it. Um, it's a part of what makes someone a comic in the first place, and that is as much of Robin's problem, his poor financial management.

Speaker 1:          02:01:00       Um, as the divorce settlements, cause if he had just, if he had been prudent with his finances and had been, um, like really good at managing his career, he would still have a shit fuck ton of money even after giving away 30 million bucks. But the 30 million bucks don't mean something that sucks. Sucks. Sucks. Sucks. Now, because that was 60 years old. You think that's just, I don't know what just is, I don't know if it's just that someone makes $300 million by making people laugh. I mean, I think if you looked at, in terms of commerce, it clearly is because people paid to see his movies. He was a draw. Everybody wanted to go see Robin Williams. He's a hilarious guy. He's a lovable personality. I think the real tragedy is not as much that he had to pay so much money. It's that here's a guy who the world loved who died alone, hanging himself.

Speaker 1:          02:01:52       Cause he was sad. I mean that's the real tragedy and the factors that led to him taking his own life by cutting his wrists and hanging himself. I mean, that's a fucking guy. Wanted to be dead. Those there's, there's many, many, many, many, many, many factors in that poor choices, a life of regret. Uh, accusations of plagiarism that haunted his professional standup comedy career. All the various things that were wrong in the life of Robin Williams, that the alcoholism, the cocaine abuse, and then of course, is health failing. There's so many different things that were wrong there. The $30 million certainly hurt, but Robin Williams made an ungodly sum of money throughout his career. He was a huge fucking star. He was making shitloads of money. He could have been fine if he had managed his, his, his resources better. I don't think you can say that the $30 million that he gave his wives was the problem.

Speaker 1:          02:02:52       Well, it was a problem for sure, and probably wasn't other than the real estate, right. I mean, he had, I think a $30 million ranch that he was trying to offload, but he was trying to get rid of it, but he could have just for, he could have let them foreclose on that, you know? I mean, he just didn't want, he didn't want the shame of losing the home. And by the way, he still had money. He wasn't destitute. It was not like we're talking about Robin Williams is living in some fucking no, no. He's bag motel somewhere. Set himself. He took the TV Gig for the money short did. Yeah. Because he wanted to keep his lifestyle the way it was. And look, it's still fucking TV gig. It's not like someone told him to work in a coal mine. No, no, no. I'm not CBS.

Speaker 1:          02:03:32       I get that. Yeah, no, I can. I mean, it's a great job and it failed. And one of the reasons why it failed had nothing to do with his ex wife and nothing people said that he looked like he was sad. Like people watch the sitcoms said that he looked tired, he looked sad. He didn't have the energetic persona that everyone who he was, except he, it was a downsizing to him. And it was a downsizing professionally in a way that's embarrassing to many film actors when film actors go from film to television, it's a loss. And it's so hilarious, like it's like my God, you're on fucking television show. But the hierarchy of of stars is no. If Jack Nicholson all sudden started doing a sitcom, everybody be like, oh, check. But if I come down right, but if I did a sitcom, everybody be like, Hey, congratulations on your comp. You know what I mean? It's not a consolation prize for you, but it would be d level celebrity. So if I did a sitcom, it would be, you know, it'd be a bump up I B a c, you know, you know what I'm saying? But with an Aa guy, like Robin Williams does a Sitcom, all of a sudden he's a B or whatever. Right? Now let's just start hierarchy

Speaker 3:          02:04:38       of things. To be fair, I also talked a lot about the stuff that happened in his childhood that he himself had talked about that uh, he felt that he had to be, what I call it, the me plus, you know, like in order to get people's attention, in order to get their positive response, I can't just be me. I have to be me with a show. I have to be me with money. I have to be me with good looks. I have whatever it's going to be. Right. And I think that stuff comes out of, uh, I think that stuff came out of his childhood. Now that you can't be definitive about that stuff. I would love to have chatted with him, but sadly that never will happen. But, um, I think that stuff came out of a lot of his, uh, his childhood issues.

Speaker 3:          02:05:13       And I think that's really tragic. And I really wanted to, you know, there is no external solution to the problem of insecurity to the problems of feeling unlovable to the problems of feeling not enough people will try, I think until the end of time. It seems like people would try to stop the holes in their heart with whatever they can grab from talent or money your looks or fame or whatever it is. But it really, you know, I've really tried to urge people, you have to look inside and deal with that stuff in a very proactive way, uh, because the idea that you can just basically glue eyeballs of attention to yourself and become whole I think is a very dangerous myth on there.

Speaker 1:          02:05:47       It is a very dangerous math, but it's also what propels great comics to become great. And that's where it's ironic that a guy like Robin Williams, his horrific childhood, it wasn't horrific. It just wasn't good. But that childhood, I mean, he was wealthy. He is, it was just ignored. But that, that the lack that he had in his childhood was what led him to be this magnanimous, just energetic, explosive. Like, look at me, look at me. And he was just look at me guy, because no one was looking at him. You know, I know this from my own personal experience of becoming a standup comedian. My parents were, they broke up when I was five years old and my father was very physically abusive, violent, very terrifying. And then, you know, my stepfather was very young when my parents got together. And there's like, I was ignored a lot, you know, and that's what led me to become a fighter.

Speaker 1:          02:06:37       It a part of is being bullied. I was small. And the other part was what led me to become a comic was this lack of attention. And I figured out a way to, to manage it and I figured out a way with, you know, constant objective analysis of myself constantly pushing myself towards new goals, constant research. It's in, in terms of like psychology, in terms of philosophy, in terms of meditation, in terms of psychedelic experiences and all sorts of different things that I've done to try to manage my own particular insanity. But my particular insanity was more manageable than someone who's a drug addict. The people that are drug addicts with that particular insanity. The real problem is you're also creating this massive chemical imbalance in your main, and I could be argued that I've been drug addicts, some people set up my drug addict because I liked pot.

Speaker 1:          02:07:34       But I disagree because I don't smoke it every day. And I have quit for weeks on end and it doesn't bother me. I like pot. I think it's like saying I'm a coffee addict or I'm an I'm a dick in the coffee again. Nope, you can take my coffee. I'm not addicted to stake, but I love it. You know, I love weed too. I think it's a beautiful calming, insightful, introspective drug. I think it makes food taste better. I think it's, there's a lot of benefits to it as far as the way you deal with people. It makes you more compassionate and I believe it makes you more creative. I think it's a tool that mother nature has given human beings, but it's not a physically addictive in, in terms of the, what it does to your neurochemistry and what it dumps it does to, your body's like actual need for it, where you have to go in a fucking rehab.

Speaker 1:          02:08:23       If you go into Rehab for weed, you're either some sort of a weird case, like one of those people that's a allergic to sweat or something like that. Or you know, there are people that are allergic to their wives, the wives who are allergic to their husband's sperm. I've heard of this. That's not just a line. Yeah, that's, that's what I would say. I would say it's a time, but no, it is true. Are there, there's medical proof that some women are actually allergic to their husband's sperm, allegedly. What am I a doctor? Medical proof. But my point is Robin had a physical addiction to chemicals without a doubt. And one of the big ones was cocaine. He did a fuck load of cocaine. And I personally have had, um, several friends that have had real problems with cocaine and it is a Goddamn rollercoaster ride.

Speaker 1:          02:09:10       And the downs are awful. And when they go up, you know, they're, they're riding this manic wave and when they crashed, they are fucking day are just miserable. It's horrible to watch. The best way to keep people from doing coke is to put them around someone who's done coke because it is just seeing how fucked up they are when they're high and seeing how low they are when they're low. And you know, that that was without a doubt, a problem with Robin. He filled up his whole, not just with the tension, but he did it with hardcore damaging drugs.

Speaker 3:          02:09:44       And there's, uh, there's this Vancouver physician, um, I can recommend your listeners to check out his book. His name is [inaudible], m, a, t, e, and he's written a book called in the realm of hungry ghosts. And, uh, he's, uh, specializes in treating people with significant drug addictions. He's a doctor in Vancouver's drug area, drug district and so on. And, uh, he sort of noticed this pattern that the, particularly the women who were heroin addicts had all been sexually abused as children. And you noticed this relationship between childhood trauma and Adult Addiction. And this book, uh, I won't obviously do any kind of justice summarizing it here, but it goes into, and I've had him on the show too, but it goes into a significant amount of detail about the biochemistry of addiction that generally, if people have gone through these very hard childhoods and neglect is underrated as far as how harmful it can be for, for someone, uh, which is why children act out in order to get hit.

Speaker 3:          02:10:40       They'd rather get hit than being neglected, uh, for, for, for in many ways. And his basic idea is that when you have a, a neglected or abused childhood, the, your brain is missing particular receptors for certain chemicals. And then when you take drugs, you begin normal. You feel normal because you, you finally feel what it's like what everyone else feels who didn't have those kinds of childhoods. And that's why the addiction is so strongly their, you know, personal, regular happiness. Like just make up a number of happen as hundred. They'd take coke, they go to one 50, they go back down to 95 and then they settle around that. But somebody has got to happen as of 30. They go to one 10. They feel like normal happiness and what everyone else feels for the first time. And then when they crash back down their life, which formerly was just normal now feels unbearable. And that's one of the reasons why there's this drive for addiction. Uh, and, uh, I did a whole speech of this sorta college in Canada recently, so I won't go into the details, but I think there is a lot of ways in which you can see really difficult childhoods producing a brains that are very susceptible to getting the REApps from external substances that should be naturally occurring but didn't develop as a result of childhood trauma.

Speaker 1:          02:11:48       No question whatsoever. And we're learning more [inaudible] we, they are learning the people that study that are learning more about that every day and it's a fairly new science over the last, you know, x amount of decades they've just started sorta delve into these responses and then understanding genes and understanding how you could actually pass on depression and pass on these tours, sorts of behavior patterns to your children. And a guy like Robin Williams clearly had demons and I, there was, there was many, many, many, many issues. The divorce part was something, it was definitely something, but you know, it bothered me listening to you talk about that because I've had friends that were depressed. I know that, you know, it's going very clearly against the current of modern medical thinking in which recognizes depression as a disease to say that this guy was killed because of divorce. You know, when he died, he still had millions of dollars. It wasn't, yeah.

Speaker 3:          02:12:48       Well, you know, and I think in listening to you talk, I think I will retract what I said. I think I went too far in saying that that was, if I said that that was the sole course, that's, that's wrong. Yeah. I, I can't definitively say of course, that that was the sole cause. So for those, uh, foot hope for saying, if I said that, I'm sure I did. You've listened to it more recently than I have then. Yeah, I would track that. That's going too far.

Speaker 1:          02:13:07       You think you just got worked up over this idea of a alimony, this, this idea, which I agree with you that it's, it's a very strange thing. And the way you put it I think was a good way that you said that if people get fired from a job, you know, you don't get fired and say, well, I still want money. I want you to continue to pay me even though I've been fired. But if someone is married, um, I have friend who was married and I talked about this yesterday, but I'll briefly, he, uh, his wife, not only did she divorce him, but she planned it out for several months and went to all the best divorce attorneys and consulted with them so that he couldn't consult with them because it would be a conflict of interest. And she, uh, they don't have any children, but they were married for a while and, uh, she will never get married again because she did, she wouldn't receive these payments.

Speaker 1:          02:13:58       So she has her boyfriend living in his old house and when they send inspectors over there, the guy moves out. He gets a shit out, like weights around the corner with a u haul. She calls them, the inspectors gone. He turns around and you know, my friend knows about it. He, and it drives me fucking crazy because he worked 12 hours a day while she was at home doing Jack Shit. She never had a kid, had a little dog, you know, the whole deal, you know, got her nails done every day and he's just a fucking workaholic maniac. And she benefited from it greatly. And to this day, his lifestyle is impaired because he has to send her money and he's not Robin Williams, he's not making that kind of money. He, he did very well for himself, but the guy earned every fucking penny with labor. I mean, he's a hard worker and he's got this fucking ex wife that's an anchor tied to his neck and uh, he can't get free of it no matter what he does.

Speaker 3:          02:14:48       It's something Norman Mailer you American writer, he said, uh, he said, you never know your wife till you meet her in court. And I think, you know, I think that's pretty cynical for all wives, but uh, I think he's the guy who stabbed his wife and he said, as long as you're still using a knife, there's still some love there. It's only a knife. But no, I think that the alimony thing, it's funny because it actually is pretty not that common throughout history. It really came out of the Catholic Church until death do us part. You can't, right. The reason that the alimony thing basically got its root in western common law was because the Catholic Church didn't allow divorce and so people would just kind of separate the way it used to work. As you take a dowery for marrying a woman, if you're devoted, you had to give the dowery back.

Speaker 3:          02:15:27       But that was about it. But then this idea of until death do us part kind of came out of the Catholic Church and that's sort of where it came from. And uh, it is brutal and he has some people got upset and say, well are you saying that being a wife was only a job? Well, kind of. And being a husband is kind of a job too, right? I mean there is a financial aspect to marriage that, you know, it's foolish to ignore and um, I think it is a, I think it is pretty terrible. I think that's also something that breaks up a lot of families too because um, uh, more than half of people who are considering divorce, if they stick it out five years later, they say, I'm really glad I did. You know, there's a lot of um, uh, people who go through challenges, rough spots, tough spots, transitions. You never know you get sick or, or you know, you lose some money or you lose your job. But I mean, things can happen that are really tough. People have affairs and, but the majority of people who stick out their marriages, and again, it's not like 99%, but certainly more than 50 majority people who stick out there and he would just yell or we're very happy that they did. I hate using those terms. It's

Speaker 1:          02:16:22       terms, I hate saying the majority of when you're dealing with individual relationships, because they vary so widely that I don't think that you can really narrow them down to statistics. I think every individual interaction between two unique people is unique in and of itself. And that person, I'm different with my wife than I've been with anybody I've ever dated. And I think that that's how it is with most people. Sometimes you find someone who's compatible and it works great for you, but there's other times where you're thinking about getting away from them where that's probably the best fucking decision you could ever make. And I know people that say, why does divorce cost so much? Cause it's fucking worth it. You know? There's a lot of people think that too. Yeah. I agree with you though, that there are some ridiculous alimony settlements that are just unreasonable and don't make any fucking sense why as well.

Speaker 1:          02:17:09       And Europe, I mean really no such thing. Yeah. Like, and people can check out the movie divorce Corp, I felt like I'm having to wait. I don't get any money from this stuff, but I think it's a good movie and they sort of compare what goes on in Europe. So in Europe, the worst that can happen is you have to pay alimony during the period that the divorce is going through it. But once it's done, it's done. Now they can't be child support and so on. But it's not much. It's a weird thing, this idea that once a woman has separated from her husband that she's no longer able to live her life as an independent. That's so strange. I don't understand how that ever came to be and this idea that you have to keep her in the same fashion and style and the style in which she has become a cast.

Speaker 1:          02:17:48       That's so crazy. Like, if you, if you're a woman and you are used to being a waitress and you're used to living in an apartment and there's nothing wrong with that. And then all of a sudden you meet some guy who's some real estate mogul who's worth $1 billion and he puts you up in his Beverly hills mansion and you live with them for a year and you get married. Uh, should you discount the 30 years of your life that you lived as a waitress or should there be an average, you know, like one of the things that we talked about, um, the last time we were here was, um, we were, we were talking about poverty and we're talking about people in poverty work shockingly small amount. And you were saying that people that built live below the poverty line work an average of 16 hours a week.

Speaker 1:          02:18:29       And my argument to two people, two people, people in my argument with that is also of course that you're dealing with people that mostly are unemployed. So if you have one person works 80 hours a week, one person works zero, you meet those two in the middle and the, you find out what the averages. So it's not like most people would just saying, oh, I want to work one day a week. Most of them were unemployed. And when you're dealing with something, when it comes to like alimony, when you, you want it, someone in the style of had been accustomed to, you should take into account their whole fucking life. You know, you shouldn't take into account the style they've been accustomed to over the last 12 months living with this crazy rich guy, right? Like that's preposterous. The idea that somehow or another, this man that you married who's worth $1 billion that you helped earn him, you know, half of what he made during the year that you were together. Where's the evidence that you've ever been successful at making that kind of money in the past? Why should you be entitled to that kind of money? And I think the same is true with men. When Kevin Federline was married to Britney spears, that mother fucker never made a nickel. Okay. And I've seen him drive a Ferrari and that fat bitch

Speaker 3:          02:19:36       didn't earn that Ferrari on his own. He ended off the bat getting his rap career. I think at least for you, I'd like to, unfortunately, it's burned into my brain. It's the whitest thing I've ever seen. There's two cases, Kevin Federline and Tom Arnold, we won on both of those cases. Those cases are all men. But remember, it's only 3% of alimony payments are men to women. Sorry, women. Women to men. Yeah. And, and it $10 billion a year. It's a $10 billion and billion a year in money transfer thing. It's pretty brutal. I think it's brutal on man. And I think it's brutal on women. I mean, free stuff is, it's bad for the brain unless you were like, it's fabulous soul for the soul, you know, free stuff a again, hey, you know, I mean you, you're injured, you know, absolutely charity and all that. But the focus on free stuff, I think a personality is like a muscle.

Speaker 3:          02:20:22       It needs resistance. You know, you need to have challenges in life actually wanted if you have another topic. No, no, no. We can go on. So one of the questions I get quite a lot and in my colon shows is people who say, I lack motivation. I like, you know, I don't know what I don't want to do with my life and I want you to get your thoughts because you seem to be a guy who's almost vibrating with work and projects and you know, like you're like this tuning fork that never stops. What do you think is it that really gets your juices going and gets you committed and focused on achieving the things that you achieve? Well, I don't think

Speaker 1:          02:20:56       in terms of achievement, I think of it in terms of interests. What things fascinate me. You know, I'm fascinated by martial arts. I'm fascinated by comedy. I'm fascinated by many, many different things. I don't understand when people say they're bored because if I had the time to live a hundred lives, I'd be speaking different languages. I'd be living in different countries. I would, I would try a number of different careers because I think there's a lot of unbelievably fascinating, puzzling, complex things that you could study in this world. That's just me and my personality, but that's a personality also that have cultivated over years. What do you like that as a kid too? While I was involved in martial arts very early, and I think that is one of the things that motivated me to explore difficult tasks because through difficult tasks, you learn an incredible amount about yourself and you through through the fire of competition, you get to understand, you get to understand motivation.

Speaker 1:          02:21:52       You get to understand the resistance that you have inside your mind to doing hard work. You get to understand the rewards of discipline. Like you don't truly appreciate relaxation unless you've worked hard. And that is the Yin and the Yang of life. And I've said this to, to the point of people getting sick of it, but one of the worst decisions a man can make, I can only speak for men obviously, um, is to be comfortable. I don't think you should try to be comfortable. I think what you should try to do is try to earn comfort and if you, if you get a day off where you you, you've worked hard and you've accomplished goals that day off, we'll be so sweet. When I work hard and I sit in front of the TV, I enjoy the shit out of it. I put my feet up, I have a nice drink, you know, I enjoy my free time.

Speaker 1:          02:22:39       It's your back or something like that. One of those. Those are great. All right. Right now I don't use it that much though. Honestly I'm more of a workaholic than I should be probably if, if the, the balance was I probably should relax more than I do, but I never feel like I earned it, but that's part of the reason why when I do feel like I earned it, I can enjoy it. It's because I am more connected to the idea that I need to, to accomplish things and to, and it's not like for anybody else has benefit other than my own or anybody else's approval other than my own. I just, when I have a task, whether it's a I, today I'm going to write a thousand words, you know, or 2000 or whatever the number is. If I don't do that, I don't, I'm not, I write things down, like I'll write down the list of things that get accomplished that day.

Speaker 1:          02:23:23       And if I don't accomplish that, I'll get sick. Like I'll, it'll drive me fucking crazy if I can't fill out that list that drives me nuts, you know? But that's what led me to be a championship level martial artists. That's what led me to achieve the, it's like that. It's the reinforcement of those goals, like understanding that you can achieve those goals, it's going to be difficult. You're going to push through the difficulty and then you've got to understand what difficulty truly is and how much of it is just mental. How much of it is just in your mind, this adversity to, to a difficult task or to struggle. You know? And a lot of people have that, they're scared, they're scared of, of complications. They're scared of failure. Failure is a big one that people are afraid of. But failure is one of the most important things you could ever have as far as like the motivation to do things differently.

Speaker 1:          02:24:12       One of the reasons why I think that I'm good at friendships and relationships is because I failed at them in the past. One of the things that I'm good at comedies because I bombed on stage. One of the reasons why I'm good at work is because I've been a shitty worker in the past and I know the feeling of failure, the feeling of, uh, of shame of being like a week non-motivated lazy person. It's a weak feeling. It's an you don't respect yourself. You know, and I have this phrase that I use all the time to people to try to motivate people. I say that, be the hero in your own movie. Pretend that if your life was a movie and your life started now, what would the hero do? What would the person that you respect, what would the person that you admire, person that inspires you?

Speaker 1:          02:24:55       What would they do? We'll do that shit. And if you do that, you slowly build momentum. You like today I did what I wanted to do today. I started a class in Yoga, I did this, I did all these things that I was saying I wasn't going to do and now I feel momentum and momentum is a very important point in people's lives. That's why some folks don't like to take days off because they feel like they're losing momentum and they sort of have to restart the wheel up again after a vacation. It's like what they say, if you want something done, give it to the busy guy. Yeah,

Speaker 3:          02:25:24       it's true because he's in motion. He'll get some things done.

Speaker 1:          02:25:26       That's true. There's certain people that I know that just are lazy as fuck and they can never get anything done. You're like, did you do that thing? Nah, it was just getting, didn't get to it. Like what are you talking about? You didn't get to it. What did you do? You wear out instagraming pictures of you at a strip club two days ago, right? Like how the fuck did you not get that done? Right? Like you had all the time to do all these other things, but you don't have the time to do the thing that's going to enhance your life. It's going to benefit you, that's going to move forward, your career, your life, your prospects, your art, whatever it is you're working on. You know? And I think that it's, it's hard for people because we operate on the momentum of the past. And a lot of times our past has been to just fucking, just a graveyard, uh, uh, just, uh, a wreck of disasters one after the other. And you look at that and you go, well, that's who I am. I'm a failure. I drank too much. I fall asleep at work, I do this, I do that.

Speaker 3:          02:26:14       And we put kids in these schools where they just sit there passively receiving stuff rather than actively doing stuff. And then we wonder why they may, some of them lack motivation when they get older.

Speaker 1:          02:26:22       And I think there's a big problem in the fact that the, the job of being a teacher should be a revered position that's incredibly difficult to earn. I think it should be just like you know, being someone who is in charge. I mean being someone who is in charge of the development of the mind of your child is such an incredible position and an incredible, the just the, the amount of responsibility involved in influencing a young developing mind can't be under overestimated.

Speaker 3:          02:26:59       Do you have teachers that you remember when you were a kid? Yeah, I do like good stand out like yeah, like, like, like the sun in the sky. You can't see any kind see any star. I can't see the other teachers in my head for the few good ones that I had. What an incredible, if they could all be like, and obviously it'd be great but I mean teach us. Yeah. Awesome responsibility.

Speaker 1:          02:27:15       Yeah. I had some great ones. I had a few great ones that were just really good people that were smart and kind and they, they, they profoundly, I had a science teacher in seventh grade that I had a discussion with him, just me and him one day and I never forgot it. We were talking about space and he was a really interesting guy. You know, it was a bad neighborhood. We lived in, I lived in Jamaica plain, which was like this, um, neighborhood in Boston, just outside of, um, uh, Boston. It's just a really shit neighborhood at the time. It's become a little bit gentrified now, but back then it was just really sketchy, very poor kids. And there was a kid that was in my class, I can't. So seventh grade eight went, ninth is a high school is eighth grade because it was right before high school.

Speaker 1:          02:27:55       And this kid was 17 years old in the fucking eighth grade. I mean it was crazy cause they were just, they would be there for the beginning of the year and then they would drop out. And uh, the science teacher was, you know, in this shit school system, but he was just genuinely kind, curious patient man. And he talked to me about space and, and I'd never considered the idea that space is never ending. And he was explaining the concept of infinity to me and that there truly is no boundary. And if you really, I remember he said, you ever really want to make your head hurt? Just stare at the sky and try to wrap your head around the idea that it never ends. And we had this long conversation about it and they inbetween classes one day, not even a long, you know, 10 minutes maybe, but enough that I thought about that for years to this day. I remember that guy

Speaker 3:          02:28:44       that's a great to Richard Fiman was this a physicist, a fantastic guy. And uh, he said, told about his father that his, you know, he was pulling some wagon and they hit balls in the wagon. He said, you know, it's when you pull the wagon, the bowl stay for a bit, and then they bump up and then you stop the wagon. They keep going. So he was talking about momentum and physics and all that. And so like all kids, he said, well, why, why, why? And then he got to a point with his father where he said, well, why? And his father said that nobody knows. Like, why is that gravity? I mean that nobody knows. And, uh, I think those kinds of questions where you really stimulate your mind I think is a great idea. I was telling my daughter a couple of I made made two months ago about a, there's an old Spanish proverb that says, Whoa, um, habits begin as cobwebs and end up has chains way easier to break in the beginning than later off.

Speaker 3:          02:29:33       Right. Way To put it. It's a great way to put it. Wow. And uh, anyway, she just, she just brought this up, uh, you know, um, we were talking about someone she knew and, and to something that she didn't like that they did and she said, yeah, but they're still pretty much in the cob web phase so they can probably still change it at him. She was like, well, I even, I didn't remember it. She was like, Oh yeah, the cob webs and change things. Like she really, that sunk in her and she's like five. And she can remember those things that can really take you through life and give you real clarity. I think that stuff is great. And I remember those people who gave me those important lessons as, as a kid.

Speaker 1:          02:30:05       Yeah, that's a great statement. That's a big one man. Cause that is so true. If you can break them in the beginning they say that if you do something for 90 days it, it can become a habit. It becomes an ingrained, negative, positive or negative as why I've run into people that all of a sudden they just, you look at them, they look great. I've lost all this weight. Like what'd you do? I just started every day doing this. I started walking, I started eating, you know, healthy vegetables and all this different shit. And now look at me. 90 days later I'm all healthy. You know, you can't, it can be done. It's just very difficult. And it sort of flies in the face of a lot of people like to harp on free will and determinism and there is no freewill and these sort of, you know, I think those can be fascinating philosophical debates. But I think as far as like your own life, it could be a massive distraction. This idea, this concept that there is no free will. Yeah, throw that shit out the window and just fucking get off your lazy ass and get shit done. Cause this cause that's like this pontificating of whether or not freewill is a real thing. It's not going to fucking help you. Well and for me,

Speaker 3:          02:31:11       I mean I act as if I have free will because I know it's going to get me a better life and if I don't have freewill it was pretty determined that I'm going to act as if I have free will. So I don't lose anything that way either way. So I mean I'm just going to pretend like I have free will maximize it as much as I can. And if it turns out I don't, then I was pretty determined to believe that anyway.

Speaker 1:          02:31:28       I said, yeah, I don't understand it. I mean the argument one way or the other that can be proven and in each, well Sam Harris will be on soon. I'll have a conversation with him about it because he, he can go into it from a neuroscientific standpoint because apparently they can determine that. You make decisions before you make decisions

Speaker 3:          02:31:48       down in the Amygdala, like the base and the brain, top of the spine. That impulse is there. And then people make the decision and they experienced a decision up here. But the decision is happening down here. I don't think that means that's inevitable for everyone. That's part of self knowledge is learning what your emotional triggers are so that you can make decisions right now you're not just ex post facto rationalizing stuff that you want to do anyway. You learn about yourself. And I think that you can expand free well by through self knowledge. It's what Socrates said at the very beginning of philosophy. Uh, the first commandment is know thyself and that way you can figure out your own cognitive biases and you can figure out what blocks you and what, what your um, prejudices are. And then I think you get choices. But I don't think you get choices just for having a brain. You really have to explore it. Like you don't know a country just by falling into it. You out of a plane land somewhere, you have to explore it. You have to map it, you have to know the terrain and then you're competent at the country. And I think that freewill is, is pursued through south knowledge and that gives you the choice. Um, but so yeah, if you think you can, you think you can't, you're right. I mean, if you think you have free will or you think you can't, you can't have, right.

Speaker 1:          02:32:51       Yeah. And did that impulse, I would love to know if there's been any studies done on whether or not people ignore that impulse because there's a lot of impulses that you have that you never act on. Right.

Speaker 3:          02:32:59       Do you have a quarter second sign? Typically you have a quarter second to the, around to interrupt an impulse.

Speaker 1:          02:33:06       How much research has been done on that? Like how many people were observed and how through uh, how, uh, how many different complicated periods of their life where they've been forced to have weird situation. How many people wanted to strangle somebody and didn't, you know, I mean, how many times now? I think most people given how few strangulations there aren't worth, I think most people manage to, you know, slapped down the strangle hands, you know, and it's really important. Wouldn't that be like the number one argument against free will is how few people get strangled. We've all been there, we've all been there.

Speaker 3:          02:33:34       Now what about, but what about the days when do you have two days where you're just like, the elephant of inertia sits on your chest and just fucks up your nose and you just don't want to get anything done? I mean, how'd he, how'd he do deal with those? I mean, you just let them ride. I mean, how do you,

Speaker 1:          02:33:46       I don't have those days that much. No, no. I don't know if they do, I'm usually sick. Okay. It's usually like a health thing. And if I'm sick, I'm pretty good. I'm, I've gotten really good at not doing shit when I'm sick, but just drinking liquids and eating healthy foods and relaxing and I'll go in the isolation tank and meditate and I don't, I'm a, I'm not a big, I think if there's something wrong, like I'm like, Ooh, I usually don't do anything. I just usually let everything recover.

Speaker 3:          02:34:15       Your listen to your body, but it's basically a saying, we need some downtime, we need some recharge.

Speaker 1:          02:34:19       Well, that's where my energy comes from because my mind is usually pretty damn energetic. My mind is always filled with a bunch of different things I don't try to accomplish and different things that I'm interested in pursuing. But My, if I'm down, usually it's my body. Right? You know, maybe I get that. Sometimes I've worked out too hard. If I'm overtrained I get exhausted, but it just, I just recover, you know? But I don't discount peoples, the mental blockades and the different issues that some folks do have with motivation and with, uh, with depression and a that, whether that depression comes from chemical abuse, abusing substances, or whether it comes from a biological perspective. Kara Santa Maria and will be on next week on the first and uh, uh, no, I mean, uh, soon. Next week. Yeah, next Monday I think. Um, and she's a neuroscientist as well and she's had issues the 25th, that's when she's coming on and she's had issues herself with depression and she's pretty open about it and she, she understands, understands it much more from a chemical standpoint, from what's going on inside the mind. And there's a, there's a lot going on there that keeps people on that fucking couch. And, uh, it's, what's interesting is it doesn't exist in all cultures and that it may be also the society that we live in, that this is a very unnatural way to live your life and that the, the human body's not essentially, essentially not designed for sitting in cubicles, sitting in cars, no motion. And they've also shown that exercise has been as effective at mitigating depression, has have antidepressants as an Ssri, which I think,

Speaker 3:          02:35:57       I think the physical exercise plus therapy is, you know, your best times for longterm recovery from the data that I've read with regards to depression.

Speaker 1:          02:36:05       Yeah. I think people need to get their juices flowing. I think it's, it's so, it's so underrated and um, it's associated with vanity. It's associated with all sorts of insecurities about, you know, your body that you're trying to pump yourself up and your ego, but put all that out of the window. I mean, God damn, I put a fucking a bubble outfit over your head so you don't have to look at your body if you're really tweaking on that. It's not about that. It's about movement. It's about getting all your endorphins flowing. It's about getting your body into a natural state because the body's natural state is in motion. We're not supposed to be sitting around doing nothing all day. We're supposed to be hunting and gathering. And that's how our body was designed.

Speaker 3:          02:36:42       And do you know, I mean, we're not the strongest species and we don't have the biggest teeth. But you know, one thing that human beings have is like ridiculous physical endurance. Like what I've read is that the ancient hunters, do you know how they used to get their assistance hunting? Yeah. You just, you, you, you chase that animal until it's hard, just fucking explodes in its chest. And then you're like, I win. And any drag it back to camp, like, like 20 miles of running and then the zebras hot just dies and you get him.

Speaker 1:          02:37:07       We're also in Africa because it's extremely hot and they don't sweat animals sweat from their tongue. That's why a has his tongue hanging

Speaker 2:          02:37:16       out when it's hot, their body doesn't sweat water, right? So they overheat very quickly. Right? So they're good for sprints, but they're not good for long term long endurance runs. And that's what being bipeds right. I mean, um, I think I read somewhere that one of the ways that we were able to get, I'm most expensive organ is the brain. Right? But one of the reasons we're able to have the brain is because when we were on all fours, more of our back was exposed to sunlight. And so we had to spend more of the water and energy cooling ourselves off. Once we went by Piddle, much less sun is hitting the body so you have more water available to grow the brain. Because the brain requires a lot of energy and water and just really cool things. I love that biological development stuff I think is really, really fascinating.

Speaker 2:          02:37:56       Unbelievably fascinating. The development of the human brain as opposed to the brains of lower hominids is one of the biggest mysteries in all science. There's so many different things have been attributed to what caused the human brain to grow double in brain size over a period of 2 million years is pretty fascinating. But thank God it happened I guess. But this conversation probably be a lot less entertaining if a grunting and pounding our head forehead into the microphone. And not only that, if, if it was the same conversation, who the fuck would listen drew that they wouldn't be able to understand? Yeah, I think, I think that's a huge amount of human potential that's locked up in people's insecurities and inertia. And uh, I, I really, um, uh, I really would love to find a way and you know, to just get, get people to understand how much fun being in motion is and how much fun exploring and challenging yourself and challenging the world.

Speaker 2:          02:38:45       How much fun it is, but I think that there's just a lot of, I dunno, negativity, hostility of course on the Internet as we were talking about earlier, it's kind of not all over the place, but it's definitely there and I just wish people could understand that there is very little to be afraid of in life. I mean other than death, which is going to happen whether you're busy or not. What's interesting, we're were talking about essentially like if we could talk to Robin Williams, if we could pull Robin Williams aside before he committed suicide and have these conversations with them. If you look at that guy, he is in a way, a great example of someone who

Speaker 1:          02:39:20       paper should be unbelievably happy. He's been insanely successful. He is loved by millions and yet still not happy. And one of the reasons is you look at his life and it's this series of things that went wrong, series of coke binges and alcoholism and breakups of the marriage and regret for the way he was raised by his parents and all these different things that you carry around with you like weight. And it's very difficult to shed that weight. I don't know what he did besides counseling. I Dunno if he was an exercise guy or if he did yoga or what his diet was like. But there's a lot of people out there that are dragged down by their past that right now their heart's beating, their breathing out of their mouth, their fucking brain is functioning, but they're just burdened. They're burdened by their past. And it's a huge issue with folks like getting a fresh start, like getting a reset, getting this, you know, this, this escaping all the bullshit of their past. It's very, very hard for folks to do.

Speaker 3:          02:40:29       When I was a twine to yeah, to went back 20, uh, I was at the national theater school studying acting and playwriting, and I was in a play King Lear and we had this delightfully insane director, uh, who was, and, and that, so something bad happen on stage in the play. And, uh, we were all method actress, you know, I grew up on Brando and stuff like that. So it was all internal and we were just, uh, and so he said basically he stopped the rehearsal when this thing happened in the play and he said, why isn't anyone reacting? And we said, we all said Paul, but I felt it inside. And he's like, this is theater, right? Nobody has a window into your head. You've got to do something. And he got himself when he actually ended up throwing chairs, he's like, just do something to anything.

Speaker 3:          02:41:19       I don't care. Do a somersault. Produce a dove from inside your cloak. I bet do something. So the audience knows that something is happening. Don't just stand there and expect them to be mind readers. And I think that that had a big impact on me just in terms of life as a whole. You have to be out there doing stuff. I mean, the what goes on in our heads is great, but if it's not out there in the world, we'll take it with us when we die and nobody will ever know anything about it. And a, I just never really wanted to have a life where I could sort of go through life and into death like a spear into a still like, you know, barely leaving a ripple. Uh, and I think that um, the challenges of an active and challenging life where you're, you know, messing with society's perceptions and trying to advance the moral course that you are passionate about is so worth it.

Speaker 3:          02:42:06       I wish people could just live one day on the other side of that fear. I wish that people could live one day in motion and then they would never be satisfied with the inertia of their lives. But until you get there, I think it's really half the really tough for people to, to picture what it's like. I mean, you know, we were talking before the show. I mean you've, you've got a special coming up. I mean you're doing this, you, I mean you, you, your ferociously busy. And I think if people who are in Nerc could live a day in your shoes and recognize just how much fun it is and what a great challenge it is and how wonderful it is to be testing yourself on the edges of your capacities. A, a suit for significant periods of time. I think that they would go back and say, oh, can't do this anymore. But I think until you've experienced it, that's the tough thing until you've experienced it. I think the inertia feels safer and better, if that makes any sense.

Speaker 1:          02:42:54       Also important to surround yourself with other people that are also trying to accomplish things. When you surround yourself with lazy people, it's it, it's very taxing. And you surround yourself that self sabotaging people. They kind of cocked buck your ambitions a little bit too, right? Cause they're like, oh, I don't know if that'll be a good idea. I don't know if that'll work. I don't know. Yeah, well

Speaker 3:          02:43:12       I lost my spinal fluid. I can't feel my legs this. So there's a

Speaker 1:          02:43:15       negative aspect of them being around, but there's certainly not the positive aspect of being around ambitious people. If you're around happy, fun people that are full of energy, you feel happy and fun and you're full of energy as well. With standup Comedians as a really important factor. Like we, we, we grow the best, we grow the most when we're around others like us, like the best comedy communities. It's not one comic that stands out, you know, there's not, like I started out in Boston and there was like 10 12 great comics where I was and one of the things about that place as you would see all these great comics and they went inspire you and there's other towns where there are no great comics and there's no great comics coming up and you'll see like the local guys and their dog shit, their acts are terrible and the reason why is they have no one to emulate.

Speaker 1:          02:44:06       There's no one around to build them up. There's no community and standup comedy. It's very important to have a community. I did all my growing as a comic in the communities of Boston than New York and then La, the two to three rather strongest communities in the country. Boston not so much anymore, but at the time huge. And now New York is still just as giant and La is giant and those being in those clubs and being around those guys and seeing those, those other people that are out there writing new jokes and, and constantly expanding and creating and growing and getting better at the art form inspires people and that's um, that cannot be underestimated. Surround yourself with positive people and you will be positive. Surround yourself with shit heads and you'll be a shithead or at least you'll be fighting against being a shithead.

Speaker 3:          02:44:56       Yeah. I mean nobody expects to become a great tennis player if they pay light people who can't play. Yeah, I mean you, you have to match yourself against the best. And this is another thing, last random promise of the day, but the people who have low expectations and low ambitions, I also find a little frustrating at times. I mean, I think aim, aim your sights as high as humanly possible. I mean there's, there's no Schwartz and egger films unless that crazy bastard from Austria comes and says, I didn't barely speak the language, but I'm going to go marry a Kennedy, Ran California and make some great movies. We don't forget it. Fuck my main, well, there's that aspect to have that aspect. It, that's the problem with hyper ambition. It manifests itself and sometimes an unfortunate and uncomfortable to literally check the Alpha. But, um, uh, but the people who, I mean, again, I sort of feel like, um, you know, I was sick last year and confronting mortality and all that and it's sort of how I've lived as a whole is whether you're great or not, whether your ambitions are high or low, death's going to take you either way.

Speaker 3:          02:45:55       And, uh, I think that it adds to the human capital of the world to strive to communicate, passion, power, magic, creativity, virtue, whatever it is that you're good at, it adds to the human capital of the world. We all inherit this stuff that comes rolling down the mountain of history from all the great people who've come before us add a little bit. Anything that you can do that human momentum of, of energy and positivity. I think that's so important. And the people who want to do a little or get by. I just wish I, it's the biggest regret that people have when their oldest that they played at small and they didn't take the risks that they wanted to because there's this disaster on the other side of risk that never seems to materialize. And um, really it's like you're in some fight to the battle with your own hand puppets, you know, a fight to the death with your own hand puppets.

Speaker 3:          02:46:42       I think that people just take those gloves off and go and take life and, and have high ambitions and forget everybody who ridicules you for high ambitions and great things. Uh, they don't matter. And that's a great speech that Robin Williams has. I forget them. Forget them. He says to the man who's talking about the sweaty tooth madmen, the boy who's got the poetic imagination, he said, forget them. Forget them. Focus on, on your creativity and what is making you great. And I would really, I think the human potential is the great untapped resource of the planet. And uh, I wish that there was ways to communicate. I tried to do this of course as best I can, but ways to communicate to people just how amazing a life can be, which is a, an active, enthusiastic, passionate and challenging. And, um, we get this incredibly brief opportunity.

Speaker 3:          02:47:27       And I said recently in a podcast, uh, the universe has repulsively fucked itself senseless to give you life. I mean, in order for us to be here, like one single celled organisms had to meet with each other. I mean, that's gross. I don't even know where they put white, but it's really disgusting stuff that goes on in a magnifying glass that's like the worst porn ever. But we're all here because of this incredible striving for billions of years of this life and to not embrace that gift of existence. In this brief time that we have. It just seems to me such a waste and such a disrespect to the incredible odds of us actually being here and being in this relatively free country and being in this incredible time of communication, technology and human opportunity. I really want people to try and grab that as much as possible. Uh, you do not save up points that you get to redeem after your dad spend everything, leave nothing on the table. And that's what I hope people can find a way to do. But I think by living your life, I liked

Speaker 1:          02:48:21       that you set an example that people can be inspired by. And I think that having these conversations and and having something that someone can listen to when they, they, they hear this and they go, you know what? I'm going to go fucking run up a hill. I'm going to go do something. And people do do that. I get messages from people that do hear these conversations at an, it enhances their life. And I've had so many people come up to me after the show and say that the podcast changed their life because they become motivated because they never had anybody around them that was inspiring in any way. And then all of a sudden they get to hear conversations with inspirational people and they take these conversations and it fuels them it. And we need that. You know, if you can't have that community in your neighborhood, you can, you can have that community online now. You can have that community by having access to these kinds of conversations, by listening to songs that fire you up by a book that gets you going by hearing a conversation by there's, there's many, many, many methods and it's all about just having the access to these influences by having the access to these positive things. And you can enhance your life.

Speaker 3:          02:49:20       What one man can do and what one woman can do another man and woman can do. And yeah, nobody needs to be denied a great life, but you will not come to you. You have to at least go and meet it halfway. And I hope that people, I know that your show gets a lot of people roused and gets a lot of people energetic. And that I hugely applaud you for, I think it's a, it's a fantastic contribution to the world to be able to inspire people certainly in your comedy. I mean, which is fantastic. I mean, by the way, if you haven't seen Joe, go see Joe. But, uh, I think that that energy is incredibly positive and uh, I think people who grew up around negative people are neutral people. They don't even know what it's like to have any kind of incandescence around them.

Speaker 3:          02:49:57       And if they see that, then it awakens in them a possibility that probably was not possible even within their own imaginations before. And I think that social media and the Internet and Youtube, it's giving people access to conversations that they probably have been sealed off from a it for who knows how many generations in sectors of society have not had access to enthusiasm, positivity, competence, efficiency, energy. And now there's this amazing cross pollination of an energetic, enthusiastic people. We can pollinate people who otherwise would never have had access to it. I think what an amazing opportunity that is for a, for a to unleash more human potential.

Speaker 1:          02:50:36       Yeah. We live in awesome times. And, uh, I want to thank you for addressing all the criticisms and all the different things that I, I've been fielding and I think we really illuminated a lot of these. Uh, I appreciate the opportunities and, uh, if someone wants to follow you, it's Stefan Molyneux on Twitter. Can you spell that out for folks?

Speaker 3:          02:50:56       Uh, can I give the secret handshake cling on to enter the Celt compound? That's most important to me. So they can go to free domain radio. They can youtube.com/free domain radio. Um, Twitter is stiff and a free domain radio and um, yeah,

Speaker 1:          02:51:10       and Stefan Molyneux, the spelling is, it's an f s t e f a n m o l y n. E. U. X. Amen to that. You, that's right. That's it. All right, well thank you very much man. That was a lot of fun. I enjoyed it. And, uh, thanks to our sponsor. Thank you to legal zoom.com. Go to legal zoom.com and use the code word Rogan at the referral box at checkout to save yourself some cash. Uh, we will be back next week. As I said, Monday, Kara Santa Maria, Tuesday, Steve Rinella returns. And we got some other podcasts for later in the week as well. Denver, see you guys soon. I'm coming this weekend. Recording my comedy central special Saturday night comedy works in Denver downtown. Wow. Big Kiss. See Ya.

Speaker 5:          02:52:08       Okay.
