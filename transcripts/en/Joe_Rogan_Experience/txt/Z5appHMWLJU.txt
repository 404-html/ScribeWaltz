Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Hello Ladies and gentlemen, we're here with Lisa [inaudible] and Joe Diaz. My name's Joe Rogan and I host a podcast called the experience. Dude. Uh, this poster you just brought me in, Joey Diaz was just brought me in one of the dopest fucking things I've ever seen in my life. It is a, a poster with Leonard scattered and the rolling stones. And we were talking about this on the way in here. Knebworth festival from 1976 America's confederate rockers, Leonard Skinner. And then underneath it it says along with the best rock and roll band in the world, Britain zone, rolling stones. Who is kind of weird cause you've got one band that's the headliner there, the biggest picture. And then it says the other bands, the best band in the world. No.

Speaker 2:          00:00:44       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:00:45       Oh, hi. Oh wait, no, no, no. They had no fucking idea this but power that these guys were bringing over that bill on the road, opening up the ted. Ted was a powerhouse and 76 Ted nugent's. Oh, cat scratch fever, you know, freefall. Yeah, cat scratch fever and then the live out can go home. Stranglehold. Nobody was messing with. Dave was hunting. He was eating what he haunted. Nobody in heard these things. He was hunting with some shitty ass equipment too. They had like old school archery bows back then like recurves and like real shitty compound bows. Did he have like the whole compound then with like the animals and like the family has had property in Michigan for, he's got a couple of places. He's got one place in Florida and he's got one place in Michigan and they're both like these gigantic private hunting grounds.

Speaker 1:          00:01:39       He just took, he didn't do any coke. He just took all his money and he bought a, you know, just a giant chunk of land and then he's got one in Texas now. No booze, no cigarettes, no nothing. You could do any of that. He doesn't have no worry at all. No, no, no. I think he drinks a little one. He's fucking crazy. But it's like when those guys tried to debate him, like do you ever see a ted nugent versus a Pierce Morgan? No. On gun control? No. He led them up like a Christmas tree because Pierce Morgan didn't have all piers Morgan is like, you know, he, he's a proper sounding British guy. But like when it gets to the fucking red line, when it gets the red line of arguments, he falls apart. Like Ben Shapiro ate him up and Ted nugent ate him up.

Speaker 1:          00:02:22       A lot of the conservative guys that are like really slick, smooth talkers, they can eat them up when they get into the really like the high revs of the conversation because he didn't understand that a lot of the gun deaths is also bad guys that are shot by guns. Like people that are shot by cops. Like all that stuff is sort of calculated it in like he didn't understand, he didn't have all those facts in order. So you, if you're arguing with a guy like Nugen who does these kind of arguments with people like gun control arguments, he's got like his words down to a tee. He's done a couple of these. Did one of them in a gun store? They were in a gun store. Yeah, sure. Go ahead please on it. It's hilarious.

Speaker 3:          00:03:00       I'm not rock and roll stage. I just saw sang a song about waist deep. I mean, you gotta be kidding me on a rocky. Do you ever see Richard Pryor life? I want Sam kinison. How about Lenny Bruce? I one of them. Get over it. That's some funny for a man who is a, who is a patriot, who purports to love his country. That was quite shocking. Disrespecting me. Put it in a official CNN. Piers Morgan. Yes. Yes. Anybody that wants to disarm me can drop dead. Anybody that wants to make the unarmed and helpless people that want to literally create the proven places were more innocence or killed called gun free zones. We're going to beat you there. No vote you out of office or suck on my machine is, but you can take it, whichever is, I'd love to suck on your machine gun. The whole point, the whole point of your defense is that a lot of people do drop dead precisely because you are armed to the teeth.

Speaker 3:          00:03:56       You like everybody else to be not true. Write this down. See your soul. You write this stuff. 80 people a day die in America from gun shows, 75 of them to 78 of them statistics by the uniform crime report by the FBI and the UN and the UN study on violent crime. 78 of those 80 are let out of their cages by corrupt judges and prosecutors who know the recidivism, exotic control, no that the commit the crimes again and they let them walk through plea bargaining, early release and program. They still just my ass. Where you have the most firearms citizens in America, you have and lowest violent crime rate where you have the hi the worst gun control. You had the highest crime rate peers choose one. Do you want a lot of crime? We have it. Gun Free Zones. You want less crime?

Speaker 3:          00:04:44       We have that more people with concealed weapons permit. Why do you guys resists that? Statistic is a you guys, you guys are nuts. You're playing the devil's advocate and I can play any advocate. I like my side job, right? You're playing the idiots advocates. More guns equals less crime. You'll area let me, unless I'm wrong and not doing well, the couch, be sure to let you know acid at this point if you don't mind. Um, and there's something wrong with your argument, but you'll basically saying that 90% of the gun crime comes from people let other 96%. Right, but they still have to get access to firearms. If you had your way, they would be 10 times as many firearms, right? Not True. Or you want everyone in America to want to go? Not at all. I've never said, I got to tell you what is your position and I hope you don't edit this out. Whenever I've done interviews with guys that are inclined to be anti gun, they always go, well, I knew you wants everybody to have a machine gun nugent. Watch all the dear dad, what does Nugeo not even close. You want, what I want is the second amendment. We the people free individuals to have the right to keep and bear arms for self defense. Find Fault with that. Some down. It's too good at that shit.

Speaker 4:          00:05:58       Did the, the argument is just too weird. It's just a weird argument. I see both sides of it. If nobody had guns, if there's no guns, nobody getting shot. But I think people would be like my shitty and people more and shit. They do something, they do something. So they're your, they're saying 75 out of 80 gun deaths or criminals and bad people. I don't know what the real numbers are, you know, but that's what he was saying in that argument. He was saying something along those lines. Yeah. The people that guide, when we talk about people that dine gun deaths, a lot of the people that die in gun deaths are cons. Ex Cons. People out of jail, people have already committed violent crimes in her life, which makes sense. Most of the violence shit's going to be happening by people with a history of violence.

Speaker 4:          00:06:36       Well, it's crazy. The penalty you get for like, uh, uh, ex felon with a gun, like Gucci Mane just get out after two years is I like, I had been in print, like you can go to prison for like seven years. Like there's a guy who said he's Prince, his son, he's in prison for seven years and he had, it was a felon in possession of a handgun. Let me ask you this, when it's a guy like Gucci Mane, who's a big time public character, right? He's a famous guy, right? Cause ice cream tattooed on his face. He's fucking crazy. Right? When a guy like Gucci gets caught for something like that, do you think they make an example out of him? They do you think that they take that guy?

Speaker 5:          00:07:09       Yeah. You already have that law to whatever law that if you get caught with a firearm, you do two years just period period. I don't know exactly what the parameters of the law, the Brady law as something you do two years, you don't even go to court. It's two years automatically if you get caught with a gun without a permit. I don't know exactly the parameters. Uh, you know, does that keep people from doing crimes? What's that? That two years that carrying a gun for two years in New York? Yes and no. Yes and no. Right? Yes and no. Some people carry a gun and all of a sudden they go, you know what? I'm not going to say what I do for a living, whatever. I don't know. I, you know, it's like a, you're saying Gucci Man Right now. He's a high profile guy. You know, you're out at night.

Speaker 5:          00:07:54       You see some crazy shit at night. There's times I'm driving after one. I'm like, I should've carried a fucking gun tonight. You know, just in case. Just in case you never know. I don't know if, look, we were just talking about when you came in about Denver and taxes, like the make my day law. I know people have moved to Colorado for that law. You know what that Youtube, did you ever see, you ever see the video of Sonny Liston pulling a gun? Ever seen that before? Never before. No. No. What? I mean, 40 only told me about it. Yeah. Hinchcliffe told me. Yeah,

Speaker 4:          00:08:27       we were at the ice house and I was like, you gotta be kidding me. There's a video of this play that play both of them. Not one that maybe we can just place. I want to hear the redneck. He was apparently like screaming shit at Ali everywhere he went and Sonny Liston was just tired of this bullshit.

Speaker 6:          00:08:53       The whole situation finally came a head and clay approach listing at the desert in Las Vegas where the champ was shooting craps and lanes and he got up with Liston was in no mood to be harangued by the mouth from the south drawing the gun. Sunny fires frightened who's young tormentor into a hasty retreat.

Speaker 5:          00:09:11       The gun was filled with blanks. Holy. Come on son. That is one of the craziest things ever going to see in your life. Who pulled a gun out on Ali in the middle of the casino, shot at in the air and then said, look, it's just blanks. No big deal. Wanting to go back to his crap game like, dude, what kind of environment that that dude grow up in? I used to know a lot of people never carry fucking startup pissed has his shit and the 70s just to get the father would carry those type of pistols cause you never know. But what happens if the other guy has a real one venue, then you're fucked. You're fucked, then you're fucked. But that sonny liston thing was so crazy, first of all, how casually he did that. He did so casually, and then how he shot his jacket to let everybody knows just blanks. Like, come on, relax. Like no big deal. Let's just go back to the game. Right? Like he just went back to the game. He didn't go. I gotta get the Fuck Outta here right now for TMZ shows up dog. And let me say something. They'll be runs quicker when they hear gunshots to black people, they fucking, they react, they react. Exactly. Know what time it is and they have fucking that shit look on. He just shoots it in the end. They all run out. It just shows you like, I'll leave. It's so crazy.

Speaker 5:          00:10:34       But then Denali should have gone at frazier in Africa, titty, somebody shot somebody in Africa, not shot, but pulled up to the hotel with have got an Africa. Whether it was a foreman or Frasier, somebody. When holly was in his hotel room, they went over. It was frazier. What is that phrase? You went over there with a gun and pointed it up at the building and shit. Either or or something crazy like, God, these are just pulling guns on each other back. People aren't ready for Ali in the 60s when he's not playing with you have like that. They just weren't ready for him. He would just look at him. He's still tormenting him. A casino. Super metal number. The casino megaphone out of the bus window. Yeah, exactly. And that was in front of his house. You pulled up on his lawn? Yeah, he told him, man, that's what he was doing. The bus. They'd like champ that bad in the world or something crazy. I know. Like I'm telling you, man. I think Mcgregor takes it to a very high level, but you got to go back and look at the old Ali stuff. Maybe sometimes I forgot how good it was because nobody had been like that before him. He showed up at the gorilla face. Joe Frazier, what does it say? The most colorful fighter? World's most colorful. Cassius clay. The world's most colorful, and this was back

Speaker 4:          00:11:54       before he'd even change his name, Cassius clay. Wow. It's crazy, man. It's crazy that that was in our parent's lifetime and it seems like a different world when your parents left them. I'm an old man though, before Asia. I do remember being a little kid going home to living in New York City. What year was that? What year was I'm Sonny Liston. I want to say that was when I was a baby. Like I was 67 like it's 1967 or something. I don't know. When did you win the title? What year was it when he beats all he listing? Yeah, I'll slightly, it was fucking crazy. They didn't even know how old he really was. No, no one knew how fucking 90 30. It's like a Cuban dude. Their first fight was in 64 seconds. 65 64. So I wasn't even born yet. So it was three years before I was born.

Speaker 4:          00:12:49       And um, that was a different world, man. It's a different world. You watching that video, you're like, wow. Like America was just a different place. So when Cassius clay was fighting, all of the country would just stop. Like everyone went in everywhere would just watch the fight. Well, I remember when I was a kid, I was um, living in San Francisco and my parents went, we went way out of our way to make sure that we watch tv because Sonny Liston and Muhammad Ali, and not sounding less than I'm Leon spinks in Muhammad Ali were having the rematch and the rematch was a big thing to everybody because Muhammad Ali was such a hero. He was so much more than just a fighter. Especially then because he had gone over the three years, have not fought because he didn't want to go to Vietnam. What year was that, Leon to and Mama Alley is in the early seventies, I want to say.

Speaker 4:          00:13:40       Um, well, you got to have no teeth. Yeah. Leon had no team. Michael was the one that fought Tyson. Tyson knocked on Atlantic city. Yes. Right. Yes. That's Mike Spence. Michael spinks was the, the genx. He was the former light heavyweight champion. He was a light heavyweight champ for many years. He's a really good light, heavy weight, really good boxer, very smart and beat Larry Holmes for the heavyweight title. But it really wasn't a heavyweight. You know, he'd be Larry Holmes. Larry Holmes couldn't pull the trigger anymore. And you know, Michael just was real slick, real smart. It wasn't dangerous enough to like threaten homes, like to try to knock them out. But Larry just didn't have it in the tank like he did later in life. It was a controversial decision anyway. But anyway, beat Larry. And so he became the champ. I guess it was like Ibf champ or something like that.

Speaker 4:          00:14:27       I don't even remember. And then Tyson just marked them, merck them. Oh, it was awful. That's the difference between a real heavyweight and a light heavyweight. Like there's just a difference in frame. Like nobody had ever done that to Michael spinks. Michael spinks was so good. He had a nasty right hand dude. He was fucking dudes up at light heavyweight, but he was also had, had a long career, fought a lot of really tough guys and then, you know, gets uh, gets the money fight the night that he, that Tyson knock the mountain record time. Yeah. I was never so pissed off. My wife is robbing a drug dealer and he will left the house to go to watch the fight at somebodies house. So here I am, case in the fucking joint. He leaves 10 minutes before the fight, I'm still crawling through a window, fight in the dog off and all of a sudden I hear cars, I get in my fucking car, I got the coke. Well, often I see him coming back and he calls me like, and that way if somebody robbed my house, but he talking about Nah, I went, I came back early because he knocked them on 13 seconds, 15 seconds. What the fuck? I'm never in Boulder, Colorado on Macarthur Lane. I was casing the motherfuck out.

Speaker 4:          00:15:35       Those are the days where, do you remember the p? The closed circuit days? Yeah. We used to watch fights at movie theaters. Really? Yeah, it was a big thing. Yeah. You get, your friends would get together and we would go, we'd all go to a movie theater and we'd watch a fight on like closed circuit or they even have it at the Boston Garden. I used to go to the track. Oh yeah. In the metal lands and that's why I saw you, boy, the Detroit hip man, Tommy hearns fight some, but like a great fight. Like, I don't know if it was Duran or Leonard Duran, he murked around, but he fought somebody and we watched it on a track on a Monday night. Do you ever see that knock out that hearns have you seen it reasonably and pull that up? Tommy hearns man was such a freak of nature because he was so tall and long man. And he had muscle, like it wasn't just tall and long. He was tall and long. Buddy was fucking strong and if he caught you at the end of that right hand, I mean it was one of the most devastating punches and all boxing, which is why it was so crazy that hacker was able to just walk right through them. Haggler just walked right through him, man.

Speaker 2:          00:16:41       Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:16:41       Hagler you could just take it like nobody else. I mean haggler had to like nasty power, but one of the things that was most impressive about Hagler was you could just hit him with anything. They never seem to be here. Oh yeah. Ryan had a great fight. Maybe four. That was a great, great, great fucking fight. Haggler really respected Duran in that fight and really didn't take it to him. He knew how dangerous Duran was. Duran was a still a real sneaky boxers this after you'd beaten Davey Moore, but see her and just had this distance man, and he could fuck Duran up at distance. He would just like come in with that whip of a punch cod. Damn Dude. They don't even look like then the same way. Cool. Ooh, there's a right hand that drop some, Oh shit. They really weren't. Duran started off his career as a 135 pounder, then moved up to one 47 and I don't know what the fight this fight was probably one 54 if I had to guess. [inaudible] would, uh, this fight was at what? Weight class? Because he fought as high as middleweight. We fought Hagler who was at middleweight? He was fighting guys at some pretty heavy weights. One 54 yeah. So that's light, light metal

Speaker 4:          00:18:00       or super welterweight depending on what organization calls it. But yeah, there Duran was like 20 pounds over. His ideal fighting weight is ideal. Fighting way. It was lightweight. It wasn't a big framed guy like these guys, but he still was skillful enough to hang in with them for the most part. But hearns Merck.

Speaker 7:          00:18:23       Yeah,

Speaker 4:          00:18:24       it is right there as the MERC shot.

Speaker 7:          00:18:28       Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:18:29       That's one they don't even count for. When you get hit like that, they don't even bother counting. Let me ask you something. How do you feel about guns right now? This

Speaker 1:          00:18:37       point in your life with a family and what's going on in your mind? How do you feel about guns? This is the real problem with guns. The same problem with everything else. People are fucking stupid. They're a bunch of people that are fucking stupid. Now, if you had to ask me, do I think that everybody in this room, do I think that they are responsible enough to handle a firearm and own a firearm? Yes, absolutely. Everybody in this room is, I believe so, but is it everybody in the world? Fuck no, but it cou can decide. Well, that's the part in the whole law. The whole point of the law is you can't let some Thai ironical dictator decide who can and can't be armed. Because at the end of the day, what we really have to worry about as much as crime. So you have to worry about the government turning into crime because the governments of, of nations all over the world have fucked the people over and done shit that people don't want, imprisoned them, enslaved them.

Speaker 1:          00:19:29       And, but when we supposed to ignore that and we supposed to pretend we're passed that we're passed that completely, people never be like that again. An armed militia is be in the possibility that it all goes wrong. That's what it's for. It's not, it's not for when everything's going right. It's for when it all goes wrong. To deny the possibility that it could all go wrong to me. You're lying. You're lying. You're pretending we're better than we are because you look all over the world. There's war everywhere. There's war everywhere in the world. There's murder everywhere in the world is robbery and thievery. Everywhere in the world. There's not equal. It's not equal with, as the amount of chances people have is not equal. The amount of, uh, the time you do in jail if you get caught for things, there's all sorts of inequalities and all sorts of real fucking problems in the world.

Speaker 1:          00:20:15       And to deny, to say that we've reached some utopian place, we don't have to worry about the government turning into a tyranny bullshit. No, I don't think it's, I don't think the government right now is a tyranny. I don't think they're controlling you. That's, I don't think they're doing anything unbelievably oppressive. I think they respond to it in a certain extent to the amount of pressure that people put on them. And when people say things like that, we don't want to go into Syria. Remember that Syria thing or Obama was on TV. We were like, fuck this. No one wants to go to Syria. They like, what did the dit, dit, dit, dit, dit, dit, dit to ease back on the Syria. He's back on Syria. At

Speaker 5:          00:20:48       the end of the day, people that are used to going to war, liked to go to war. They make a lot of fucking money doing it. And you have to be aware of that kind of shit. You gotta be aware of people trying to force you into things. The other thing about Kent State, man, that was in our lifetime, you know the, during the Vietnam War, they fucking shot kids that were protesting the shot him on the college campus for doing nothing but protesting. That wasn't that long ago, man. It's not that long ago. I'm not advocating. That should be some fucking uprising and people should pull guns. But I'm, I am saying you can't just have one group of people running other groups of people with no recourse with, with no you, you, the, the, the, the, the people don't have any ability to stop them.

Speaker 5:          00:21:36       So the people in power, we just have to trust that they're going to be good. That's crazy. Why would you do that? They're just people and people. If you give them too much power, they almost always fuck it. The almost always abused the shit out of it. It's very rare that someone gets in a position of power and all of a sudden does wonderful selfless things for the world. Bullshit. They do weird things. They have weird fucking people that get paid off of subsidies for like oil and corn and greasy dealings with private prisons. Like there's a lot of fucking weird shit going on and power. So to say that we're just, oh, everything's gonna be fine. We don't need guns in him. In England we didn't have guns and we find you still a queen. You still in some weird fucking quasi imperial state.

Speaker 5:          00:22:26       The scariest thing though is like if you go on facebook and you scroll through this video after video of people fight, like that's the biggest thing that was worldstar orange people fighting. Well that's only hears me for all these people to have guns like it. That's true too. But to be honest, like with all the road rage happening, like that guy a few months ago, it got pulled out of his car. I'm like Hollywood boulevard. Some fucking gun took up to be on the offensive. I don't want a gun to be on the offensive. Right. I want a gun and case. Last night him and I were talking shit to pull 30th bet on my side street. Three cops with three, uh, a guy kept circling God, you know, after half hour cop came by because somebody actually called the problem with competencies is two guys standing out there. Ah, bullshit.

Speaker 5:          00:23:08       Look at you and criminal looking motherfucker. We were out there just telling stories that till the commies. Yeah, I know for a minute. Then when that white car came around the second time, I thought I needed a gun. I don't know what people are thinking. No, you don't know what people are thinking. You could zig when you could have zagged and you could run into someone who's out of their fucking monitor and fucking once and you never know. I mean, I'm not an advocate of being armed all the time. That's not what I'm saying. What I'm saying is you can't let the government tell you whether or not you can have a weapon. It's just not. It doesn't make sense. For years, I had the felony. I still have the felonies and the government tells me I can't have a pistol. Now. Mike crime was with a pistol.

Speaker 5:          00:23:55       All right. They go off. No, but there was a potential for violence. There's always a, always a potential for violence in my heart and in my mind. I did a probationary period already. That was a 19 987 I did a probationary period. Again, more in the probationary period. I feel in my heart right now, I'm capable of carrying a gun. As much as I hate it, I fucking hate those things because I know what they bring. You know what I'm saying? I know what they bring to some people and I got to bring it to me cause I'm not young and stupid anymore. Do you understand me? I really wanted to protect my daughter. I really wanted to. There's weird people doing every time you watched the news, every time I watch the news and I see something stupid. What happened in Houston yesterday? You see that?

Speaker 5:          00:24:36       Yes. No. So what happens? Soldiers snapped. No four fucking tours in Afghanistan and he got some fucking machine gun. He shot somebody at a gas station. There was so many fucking bullets that the gas station blow up in a suburban install. The cops were in this, you got to see the cop cars. It was like heat. Remember those cars with the windshields and shit. So do not get in a road rage with somebody. No, no, no, no. He just wanted to go guest as you shot a customer and from there the party started, walked down the street shooting a one dead six engine, you know, shot up 30 fucking cause in the middle of the street. I'm walking into a movie with my daughter. I'm minding my business instead of fucking driving. Let's walk through the Taco place today. That could happen. That could happen.

Speaker 5:          00:25:20       I know this going in when I leave my house every morning, I know this is possible and that's the messed up part because he has a gun, he has the right to have a gun. But if someone else in Houston, they come up, shot dead, six injured randomly. Just that whoever you need that in your life. Now I'm not a sharp shooter. Black could shoot him in the fucking leg. I believe in shooting them in the leg. If I have a great cover, I'm not looking to shoot the fucking guy like the cops are gonna. I mean you should have heard the tapes. It's crazy. Mass Texas to where everybody's armed. But you know, many people are not trained. That's also big part of a brother. Let me tell you something. You have no idea what happens to your body when you hear a gunshot 10 feet from me.

Speaker 5:          00:26:03       Oh yeah, you have no idea. I don't know. I don't give a fuck what they won't want to try for chocolate though. And I know, I know he knocked the fuck out of you, but you've never heard a gunshot go off. You got to see people's faces to see people's faces and you hear that clip for real. They ain't a movie. The Saint, no dogs no longer in movie or what's the other guy that played the mechanic? Ain't one of these movies. This is [inaudible] stadium. You know, just shoot you. It just kills you. That's why people freeze. Freeze. You're going to shock people that are not used to that. They play Bingo and they take their family for ice cream. They don't need that shit. Yeah, I, I'm petrified. I live in theories of

Speaker 1:          00:26:44       this. It always listen to this Ted podcast. It was really interesting man. And they were talking about a comradery and they were talking about the people that go to war together. And one of the things that they all say is that, uh, their comradery and their love for each other is unlike any love or friendship that anybody else could ever possibly experience because it's so intense because it's like life or death every single day in that when the wars are over and they're back home, they're happy, they're safe and they're with their family and everything, but they, they look back and they go, the best time of my life was being at war. Like tat. That's crazy. What does that say about people about, and I'm not, this is not a judgment, I'm not like not a moral judgment. What does that say about people? What I'm saying is what does that say about the way the brain works?

Speaker 1:          00:27:32       Like how strange is it that people can get so excited about being in danger and the comradery that comes from being in danger? It like reawakens us almost puts us in this like primal state that we use to exist in. And now instead of that worst case scenario, some guy fucking snaps and he's on the high, he starts shooting at people. That's the, that's kind of like worst case scenario that we all worry about. But most people fucking keep it together, which is one of the most amazing things about being a person. But the experience is flat, does not enough excitement. There's not enough happening. There's not enough stimulation is not enough creativity. So you live a different life, you live a different life. You guys are podcasts and then doing standup shows. So there's all this, how this outpouring of creativity. You have all this, uh, room for expression. Some people that just feel like compressed, they feel like they've just, they've got a board tied to their chest, into their back, and every day someone pulls the fucking strap on that board and that's every day. And it's just boring as fuck. And when they deploy and they're over there and you know, yeah, they're gonna miss their family. Yeah. They're going to be risking their lives. Yeah. All the, all those things are 100% true, but for them, that experience was the best time of their life. That's amazing. We're strange. No,

Speaker 8:          00:28:53       no, no. Because you and I work in an office together. You'll meet Jamie and lead work in an office together. We go on every Monday we talked about the UFC and then, and I will lay this back, the fucking stocks and bonds or whatever the fuck we're doing, and then we call away on Friday and that's it. The same works for the people I did crimes with early on. I still talk to those people because I went through a weird experience with that. Something that you don't do it. Most people something that, and they accepted me, who I'm in front go on before and I, I talked to this kid timmy, I will every fucking day at five in the morning we'd talk. He was the getaway driver. When I robbed the jewelry stuff, I have a loyalty to him, but we were at a light and the cops came by and the trunk opened up with a gold chains. We both shut up pants.

Speaker 5:          00:29:42       It's, you know, it's something about that. I always had the respect for the camaraderie. What gets you through those first six years of comedy when your life is shit. What the fuck gets you through it? We'll get you through. We were just talking about it right when I call you. When I go with driving to quincy tonight motherfucker. That way you just is dead always. Shit. How much older than I got like 11 bucks Joey. I know like fucking nine dog. We got a steak. We'll buy a bag of weed. How much fun you don't want to like that's the best part of comedy. It's hard to believe, right? That's the batch part account. I don't give a fuck what anybody tells you. Standing ovations. Selling tickets. Look. Part of comedy you're going to remember is when you were brody Stevens in the car with Josh Wolfe and I got brody in the back, tied up in the fucking back in the Volvo and I'm doing a hundred with his car and he's yelling, stop it.

Speaker 5:          00:30:33       Normal people do not live like this. Every time I see droughty I give him a hug because it's when I'm in that fucking box on my mission to wherever the fuck Buddha land. That's what I'm going to be thinking about. How good of a time that I have when I had $3 in my, you ever read the brother Sam book, brother Sam, you know about Sam and Sam Kinison, his brother Bill, part of that fucking story. The best part of that whole story that every time I see call I give them a hug because I can relate. It's when they talked about how broke they were and they would walk to the comedy store, they eat the fruit from the bar. The bartender would chop up. Wow. Who admits that? Who had mixed that? But you and I know that secret. And it's the same thing, man.

Speaker 5:          00:31:19       Well, this is a thing that this happened to when you're going on those gigs where you don't know if this is gonna be, it's going to be successful, not just the Gig, but this has a career like you. You're not like, I'm a comic fucking, I'm a comic. They like, am I pulling this off? Like, is this, I got a Gig now and I'm trying, I'm, I'm out here. You know, it's like me and fitzsimmons would do these gigs and we would both be like barely should be talking to people on stage. Barely. I mean, we were rookies, man, we were fucking rookies. And in Boston, if you could string together 20 minutes, they had so many rooms. Everybody was working. It was crazy. What are you able to have fun during that time? Or was a yes. Fucking great. Unbelievable. So fun. But I was like terrified.

Speaker 5:          00:32:04       It wasn't going to work out. Terrified that I was wasting my time. I mean, cause it was a big chance. I quit everything. I knew I'd been papers or something like that. I kept delivering papers, but I quit teaching at Boston University and I quit teaching classes. I said, I don't want to do it. I said I don't want to half asset and I'm not thinking about it the way I used to think about it when I was teaching before it was like it was a, it was life. I was teaching life and I was teaching, well you know people kicking and punching. It was like as important as life. It was everything. I was thinking constantly about techniques and movements and strategies and constantly and so when I was teaching people I wanted people to be as into it as I was and if they weren't I really wasn't into it that they were, I I like, I had a bunch of students that I took up to like you know, pretty good level, like a, you know, below black belt but pretty good level where they're getting really good and starting to win tournaments.

Speaker 5:          00:33:00       It was really exciting. I was doing all this, like from the time I was like 19 to 21 and I'm so teaching and competing at the same time. And when I first started doing comedy, I was really, I realized right away I was like, I got to quit. I coulda quit everything. I just got to do this. So it was like, it was such a fucking leap man. Every Gig, I was terrified. I was like, is this stupid thing I'm doing? Look, what am I retarded? Why the fuck I think I'm funny? One thing I can get people to pay me to talk and I'd see the guys that were doing and in town, the guys that were making it, and it was just like they feel, they felt just out of reach, just just out of reach. So you never know, you know? And then you'd go and you'd do some Gig in Maine and get heckled and eat dick.

Speaker 5:          00:33:43       He's fucking Obama stage. And they'd go, oh my God, what else could I do if this doesn't work out? What else could I do? Because there was nothing else you wanted to do. No, I would go home at night after a bombing and just cry and I'd circle. They used to have just for the labs and newspaper. Yeah, I remember that section. It had all the clubs state by state, Alabama, and I would circle the clubs. That's, I'm going to show them some day show that Birmingham, but I'm going to go to see, I love the ground and, and one day event. And you're like, wow. But it's so weird that there's so many things I'm alive. You could pay for. You can't pay for love and you can't pay for Camaraderie. Man. There's something about a camaraderie, a real camaraderie. He didn't like. Sometimes when you go to Jujitsu, when this guy fucking design, yet he taps you at the end.

Speaker 5:          00:34:34       You get up and you hug them. You go, man, that was great. You sweat my face. Jesus Christ. I could smell the cheeseburger from last night. And that's come out of it. You can't pay for that. But it's weird that, listen, if you're running with people everyday and they got your back, I can't imagine that camaraderie. That's real. Yeah. So what about, what were the comradery that we're talking about that this makes you understand like what the story about these guys that want to go back? You know like the movie hurt locker, you know, but that's what's different because that guy was kind of addicted to Dis disarming bombs, right? The dude, the other one, the Clint Eastwood one American sniper. Oh right. Goes back and she couldn't figure it out. Why do you keep going? What the fuck did you won't shut the fuck off because you won't shut the fuck up. And this kid, I don't know what's going on. Let me go over that. At least kill people. Because then you feel, can you imagine Joe Rogan? Like all your life you got thrown out of school. You know you're fucking your mechanic, you'll laws, but all of a sudden you realize you're going take alive.

Speaker 8:          00:35:39       You have to think of that. You would put yourself in that position when you're 18 years old, 19 years old, you're in Vietnam and you realize that you're taking your first tour back to the United States. Now you finished your year, but you survive the 11 that went over this, six of them laugh. Then you survive and then reality in God's eyes you got 18 kills. Nobody knows that as like a 19 year old. Now you go back to civilization and you've got to get paid 10 bucks an hour to change tires. Why do you think for years I kept selling coke because nothing really can compare to that excitement, excitement, excitement of doing something and I'm supposed to do, I'm going to, I'm going to go sit with my wife and drink mint juleps with her fucking family. I could be killing motherfuckers right now. You know?

Speaker 8:          00:36:30       You know, you know you get that rally that you get a lot of love for doing that. It's like you get love and respect from the people that you work with for doing your job correctly. But then for manning up but then not dead when you're stabbing them motherfucking tickets got dog and how strong your heart heart's. And then our dad, brother one, it's like a shock when they get that taste of blood, those 18 the way that they should be over there when the ways that they want you when you were 18 but when you're 31 and tried to go in, you already got beliefs and shit. That's why I think your central nervous system has already been set. They can't get you to kill and forget, but an 18 year old who rob, she had blood free. What's that marine say? Semper fi. Mighten Cuba's yet, but their fleet.

Speaker 8:          00:37:16       I thought about that. Can you imagine coming back here at 25 and now you've got to work at a bakery? Couldn't imagine good luck. 1250 an hour and you get two weeks a year of me and my all you're dreaming about his fucking putting makeup on and I treat with ropes with a machine gun and a gun and knives a whole, how much work do you think they'd put into Red Justin guys, those first reacclimating them back into society after. You don't want me to tell you the problems we have. We don't, we can't do it effectively. It's like a guy getting out of prison after 20 years. We haven't figured out a way to do it effectively yet that there's no mishaps. There's always gonna be a small percentage for this guy in Houston. Yesterday did four tours. How old was he, Jamie for tours?

Speaker 8:          00:38:06       What the fuck are you going to do in this? The United States, it's going to give you that unless you go on stage. Even that, even that, it's nothing in comparison. You said earlier, like how crazy our brains are. It's crazy how different. Like when I was 18 it was 2007 I got just graduating high school, so like Iraq and Afghanistan were blown away. It was right at that time and I had friends who went over but might like what you are saying is exciting. What I would want to wait from that. There's no part of one five

Speaker 1:          00:38:36       years old for toys. Oh my God. Yeah. Well you're a smart guy, Lee. No, but they're smart people there. There's like, oh it's just people that are willing to do the stuff that's more dangerous because it feels better because it feels like even though there's risk involved, at least you feel charged up and alive. There's a life of excitement versus a life of, you know, why do you think people climb rocks? They'd climb Brock's cause it's actually enjoyable climbing a rock. No, they climb a rock cause it's fucking scary and you don't know if you can make it. You pretty sure you're to make it. But there's a real risk that you get a fucking hand spasm and you use this fall for a long time until you splatter on the bottom. When you watch someone crazy like Alex honnold, right? The guy with no ropes, it does it with no ropes.

Speaker 1:          00:39:28       We had them in the podcast is super nice guy. Real, real interesting guy. Lives out of a van, just travels around in climbs rocks. He's an adrenaline junkie kid. The climbing of the Rock, it's like, I mean I guess it's Kinda cool to be up high and it's sort of like a version of hiking for him cause he can kind of make it. But what's really going on is you, you recognize that you are on the edge always. And so even if you're not like your adrenaline's not flying, you're not freaking out, you're heart's not pounding your heightened focus. Incense is keenly aware that you're holding back a waterfall of adrenaline. You're keeping it together. And so you're, a lot of times guys that are doing like crazy shit, like tight rope walking and stuff like that. They're, they're sort of addicted to trying to control what is this guy doing jamie? Oh is this part core or something? Just something really scary here in about two seconds. Go hand in a handstand. No, it's not.

Speaker 1:          00:40:29       Uh Huh. Oh my God. Oh my God, this guy did. He jumped and then did a hand. He's still doing it on the edge. Oh. Oh my. Have you seen the videos? I like the people on the hover boards. Hover boarding on like the tops of buildings. Don might have freaked me out more than the hoverboard cause it guy was upside down and I watched my daughter do those things. They don't know what he's land. Perfect. Fuck man. Jesus Christ. What the fuck is going on in Russia? What are they feeding these people then? Radioactive pigs from Chernobyl goes. Ain't Russians? Russia. Russia. You heard Russian? I heard Russian. Didn't you hear Russian sound? Sounded the Russian sounds. My hands are sweaty. I'm assuming it was Russian and my being racist. It's not a race though. Rush the owner's room reason rob Washington isn't a racist because they look like us. Right? I mean they're totally not regular white people. No. No. What does it say? Does it say it's Russian? Yeah, it is Russia.

Speaker 5:          00:41:34       See Jesus Christ just assumed. I pretty sure I heard some Russian sounds though. Yeah, we're, we're crazy people crazy with the need. The juiced up need for those things. It's like, how do you feel? Don't you don't even like feel sad when someone's a comic and then they quit and then you see him kind of hanging around in a comedy club and they come back and hang around and I haven't done standup at 10 years. You believe that? Yeah. How to deal with the bullshit no more. My family's getting raised correctly. Okay, that's fucking great. I just listen man. You're going to do things in life that you don't like and you, and you recognize it. You move on in La. How many people have we met? How many people that'd be starved? So how many people went to Montreal and I had said a lot and all of a sudden you don't see him no more.

Speaker 5:          00:42:29       You just what I'm saying? And then one day you go to a town and you got to facebook, hey I had to come back cause my uncle died and I'm doing the podcast and kind of do a guest spot. You're like, nope, nope. I don't know who you are. I mean I just don't know what's going on in anymore. The whole guest spot things are weird thing, you know? It's weird. It's weird to ask people to come on a professional show if you're not a professional. Like I get it. Like that's how people get better. They do guest spots, but that should be something that somebody asks you for. It's you know like would you like to do a guest spot like that? You know like check you out on stage in front of 3000 people but to like ask to do that. Like cause we all know like some comics that are weird, they'll like show up at your shows and asked to do guest spot.

Speaker 5:          00:43:15       I'm like God I didn't know you were here tonight. Yeah, I'm just driving your backspace fucking Ontario often young and you didn't know I was here tonight. You don't see my name out there. I made a rule about two years ago. I love comedians. I know what it is to be a comic. So I'll tell you what I do. I know what it was like for me to feature until he that $400 for rent and want to say that you get a call the week before it. The headline is bringing a feature I get, so I made a deal. I won't bring a lot of features, but I'm not doing guest spots and the word gets out. It's so crazy. The word really gets out when you don't do guest spots, people don't show up to your shows no more. That's interesting. I don't want them. Whereas before they were showing up and you they want to hang out in the green room and here's my philosophy on it. If you're so funny, you wouldn't be here. Get, go get onstage.

Speaker 5:          00:44:08       And you know people come to the green rooms and they want to hang out and that's great. I love seeing my old friends and stuff, but I'm working right now and you're not working well, not only that, you don't have to be on that show. Here's the thing, like I, when I was a kid and that was a starting out, I love going to shows. I still love going to shows. I don't have to be on stage to enjoy a show. So if I go to show, then I'm like trying to get a guest spot on. Someone's showing don't even know that person or barely know that person. That's fucking weird. I never did that. I don't know anybody who did that. None of us did that. You either got asked or you just kept working. He kept doing shows that were at your level until you got better.

Speaker 5:          00:44:48       That's just what everybody does. Like this guest Bot thing, like that is not how it works. You can't just show up and get on in front of a couple thousand people. I didn't have two gigs the night I lied to you because I knew you were going to ask me to come over to the ice house, but I know you're working. Yeah, but I don't care what else. I don't want them disrupting. Oh that's very kind of you. But I sometimes I go to the ice house and there's 18 guys up before you and I go, this isn't right. This pool guy did a all with justice and now motherfuckers are doing 20 in front of me, you know, and I go up there and the weight he gets mad at me because I noticed like the feel when I get to the fucking club. But I'm ready to go steams coming out of my nose.

Speaker 5:          00:45:30       I got to eat two stars to calm me down. I already ate, I worked out, I'm fired up. I gotta wait two or three fucking comics now the last 15 minutes I'm pacing back there like a fucking animal, you know, I just want to get up there and do my fucking thing and now I got to wait. And it's not that, it's just that some comedians come into a room to ruin the show, blow this fucking place up and they really blow away. When I get down Thursday you work with the other two guys, you get the niche, you see who you're already working with. And then some guy wants to come in Saturday like, oh my God, I didn't know you went down because I do it guest, it's not going to happen. Especially Saturday cause he got to show you, I've got two shows especially fucking Friday.

Speaker 5:          00:46:10       And it's like my heart goes out to you as a comic. I know what it is to be a struggling comic, but there's nothing going on here. But who does let guys to guest sets? Who does what? What does a lot of Comedians, national headlines or just let the local guys do guests sets. I Dunno and don't you have to worry about like putting on a good show? Like if you put it on a guy who was terrible and they would just ruin the show. These people paid a lot of money first. So I will let someone have a guest spot once. And, um, this was, uh, on a, a show with like in one of those ice house type shows, like 10 people on and he bombed so bad that it tanked the rest of the night because the people had to sit through 10 minutes of like really clumsy, shitty jokes like from someone who like barely does comedy, you know, I had find out later and then afterwards, like the audience had a lowered expectation whereas before it'd be like Ian Edwards, Tony Hinchcliffe, Tom Segura, smash, smash, smash.

Speaker 5:          00:47:06       And everybody would be experiencing that all night. Well there's this 10 minute gap where it was just sludge, just like really shitty ideas and just not done well and the audience went whoa. Like you could see them get super bummed out. Yeah. Especially when you're on a good show like that. I've been lucky enough to go the past few weeks to the store. But Joey, when it's really good shows it's fun. But when there's like, I went to a show once and there was a magician on this on stage and it just, I just, I think of him because I know he hates it, but it's so weird how important it is to build a good show and to build, it shows the comics who global altogether it's, you can't just have, you can't just throw a comedian's up there and have a good show. The problem is like people are friends with people that you know, and then you know, they, you know, you know them and they know you and the, hey man, can I do one of those ice house shows?

Speaker 5:          00:47:55       Yeah, sure. Come on down. Doucet I'll say, and then you just go, oh no, what has happened here? Jesus fucking Christ. And if you do that like this, this guy, like it's written jokes that day and was doing them that night. He had never done them before. Like, can I try to do like a Ho? So it's a long ass story. But when that does happen, the p the audience feels like you fucked him. You know, like people always say like, why would I take the bass comedians on the road with me? Like, dude, wouldn't you want to like stand out front of the other comedians? Oh, the audience feels like you fucked him. Then like you've made up for the fact that you fucked him by being really funny for the last hour and 10 minutes. But you know you fucked them for the first 20 minutes. If you fill in the blank with the name of the Comedians, there's a bunch of crazy fucking comedians that will open for other like national acts and they don't work anywhere else.

Speaker 5:          00:48:47       They just, the work is like opening acts for big time national acts who don't want to be like showing up on stage. They don't want someone going on before I'm being really funny. But isn't that the point of the opener to warm them up? Like that's why they have a studio warm up people for TV shows because they want them to have good energy and I want you to warm him up to a degree that you really have to hold back a little bit because they're the star of the show. This whole stupid. I rather we come from the school of thought. We want everybody to be fucking great because of the guy in front of me is fucking great while I'm back there taking them, watching this, I'm going to come out throwing 92 miles an hour if the guy's in front of me is lack of days.

Speaker 5:          00:49:34       I, it happened to me one time where you on the road? We left the gift set up. The guy's energy was low. I W he sucked me in when I went up there and bomb because of him because I didn't want to make him. It was so bad. I said, I'm not going to do material now I just go up to him and talk because it's a bad thing that does happen when you watch really bad comedy, like someone who's like really amateur level comedy. It's something weird happens where you get confused as to what's funny, what's not funny. It's like it's almost like a smokescreen, like one of the ink things at a squid shoots and like, yeah, like you see someone on stage that's really new and really bad and just you got to get out of the room. It's like why? Like you can, your mind can get locked into their way of thinking because that's what I think is happening anyway on stage. I think the reason why comedy is so funny, it's because you're thinking like that guy, the guys

Speaker 1:          00:50:28       taking you for a ride and when you let a bad comedian take you for a ride, like you get stuck in like what they're doing on stage. Say if they're doing like real obvious hack material, cop donut jokes, you know, Tampon Chubb price check, you know that kind of stuff and the audience is really laughing. You'll, you'll get confused and your whole set you like you have to shut him out and like, wow, la La, you've got to listen to some music. You got to go onstage fresh. Like they didn't exist. You're better off not seeing them. I don't want to see him no more. I come out like gladiator. Yeah, you have to come out of that case like Gladia. I don't want to get caught up like Friday or Saturday early show on what's the other acts and I started getting into it, but until then I want to come out of the box like a fucking savage.

Speaker 1:          00:51:14       Right. But if you're working with people that you love, like if you were doing a show with Dunkin and Ari, you'd probably watch a lot of their set. I would, yeah. That's the cool thing about when we do the road together, we watch each other. Shit's fun. It's like I get to see a show and do a show, you know? It's fun. I love going to the stores and the back and laughing me to one of my all time. Favorite things to get done a little early, like your spots at 10 45 you get none. They were 10 and you watch a few guys and it really gets you in the, in the swing of things. I was like, yeah, it really does get you going. You know? But I don't want to sit there all night either. Well that's a cool thing about the store, Zoe.

Speaker 1:          00:51:55       Some chose going on, someone's three rooms can move around, watch a bunch of different shit. I think that's a not to be taken lightly. I think with anything. I think if you were, um, you know, if you are a knife maker, if you are really into making custom knives, you'd want to be around other dudes and make those things. That's why they have those expos where people get together and they, it's what he'd been up to, man. What's going on here? I mean, there's no nine man. It's doing a stainless steel. Look at that. There's a dude who, Anthony Bordain did this thing when he's done these videos about people making shit. This guy makes knives with metal from meteors. Where does he get the meteors? Meteors like the fucking land on earth. It can pick it up. Yeah, you can buy them. And they're super expensive.

Speaker 1:          00:52:40       So He's, he's getting his iron from space. Look at this guy. Whoa. Look at that fucking knife. Come on dude to Kramer knife. This guy makes these things by hand who can pull it's receiving and find the video cause it's fucking crazy. He's got like this herth I guess that's what you call it, right? What do you call it when you some sort of an oven where he's baking these knives but with Bordain bordain is like a, he's a real lover of craftsmanship. So this is making these things sort of in a similar way to the way Samurais made them. Well you have big plates of metal and um, you, you compress them and heat them up and smash them and get all the layers into one layer. But it's all done with iron

Speaker 4:          00:53:26       that he's getting from fucking media right now. What's the difference between the IMF and the media rights? Just, it's cool. You could say it's from space. It makes you, so it's not a strong iron or nothing like that. It doesn't last. I think I would, as far as I know, I mean there's ways to harden iron and steel. What survives coming. He'll actually, you, we're talking about steel, they're making steel, but I'm using the iron from space. Uh, I don't think there's any benefit. I think it's probably just really cool looking and awesome to say. It's just fucking steal. I mean, it is what it is, you know? Right. Isn't that correct, Jamie? Yeah, that makes sense. Uh, Captain America's shield that they got from the right. Exactly. So this dude, I think his name is Steve Kramer. Bob Kramer, excuse me, Bob Kramer and Bob Kramer throws 'em this giant chunk of metal and it's unbelievably hot oven.

Speaker 4:          00:54:21       And then he pulls it out and then he puts it in this machine and hammers it and he's just talking about all the different methods of hardening steel and adding carbon and all the things that they add during the process. But it's crazy wild shit, man. Leave that. So he pulls out this orange and white glowing thing and they, it pounds it down, so he takes it and all those layers get smashed down into a thinner and thinner layer and it just keeps doing it over and over again until it becomes like a blade. It's wild shit man. So when it's down to being a blade, that fucking thing is so compressed and smashed down. Just really interesting shit. So what is the name of the video? People want to watch it raw craft with Anthony Bordain. He's got a bunch of these. He's done. I don't know how the fuck that guy has so much time.

Speaker 4:          00:55:22       Just so much shit. There's like a few of those guys where I feel lazy dude does personal speaking gigs when eating out with their joint is pray, leaves, pumpkin shoots a little bit of nature bugs. Joe Dan was nature bucks, never killed nobody. This guy's making fucking swords. I mean that those guys want to be around each other. You know like if you're making knives like that, you're going to want to be around other people to make knives as well. It's like we're the, one of the things about places like the store is a, we can all meet each other and hang out like the other night in the bar, like Stan Hope Ron White, me bunch of us just hanging and I'm like, well where's their place like this? Where we can meet like a s fucking saloon where a fellow fellow travelers can meet. I got to tell you something. Run. Why this really taken to the store? He has, he's really taken to the store. Like he's one of the guys and he gives you a big hug. He's got a drink in his hand. He's happy as fuck up there. He goes up there. He the fucking room

Speaker 8:          00:56:24       in a slow, methodical way. But at first he would just stay back there and go, what the fuck is this shit? This ain't right. And yeah, and I watched them. I've been watching him just become a guy at the store. Yeah. He's always in the back bar is always hanging out with were bro. He's always at a bar. If there's a bar open, he's close by the way. Walking fucking with distance. Okay. That guy's the real fucking deal. Yeah, no, he shows up with his own bottle and ice cubes. We has his own brand. Right. Tequila. What is it called again? Get Fuck Gut something. That's what it's something won. Something won. Fuck's it called number one. Number one. Yeah, that's it. Number one. How racist number one. Tequila Papa Ham. It's good shit. It is really good shit. He had it at the meeting. As far as that stuff goes, it all tastes like shit really.

Speaker 8:          00:57:21       You know what I mean? Let's be real. Even the best tasting Tequila tastes like shit. The best tasting, all that alcohol. I never get the people. I sit wine, I started don't like wine. I can drink a glass of wine. You know it's, it's still alcohol. I still like Jack Daniels shot. It tastes off as the shit out of me. It tastes like shit and I love it. You know what you're talking about that that I still remember I was a little boy in New York City with my mom and I let leap for Joe Frazier. Like I lived on 88th street. Like I still remember how big that event was. Like if you asked me about events in New York City, one is Muhammad Ali, Joe Frazier to and the early seventies and Elton John came to New York City. He fucked that city up. The captain, fantastic and goodbye yellow brick road. When I was a kid, he fucked up traffic.

Speaker 8:          00:58:09       Michael Jackson, fuck up traffic of 84 you know, he a couple of nights at the garden then, but Mohammed Ali, Joe Frazier, when I was a kid was fucking huge. It was huge. I remember crying. I wanted to watch it. I tried to get a blow job from my babies, so that was a kid. She was a Puerto Rican chick named D. Dot. And I kept asking about blowjobs. She goes, I'll give you a blow job. So I gave her a bag filled with quarters that I had and she came into the room and I took a shower. I comb my hair, I put Cologne on, and she came into the room and blue on my stomach and said, that's a blow job. And took my $20, killed the dog. I cried myself to sleep that morning. My mom, I woke her up like, I got to talk with you. My mom was like, what is in broken English on my teeth and stole my $20 and she said she was in a suck my dick and she did.

Speaker 8:          00:59:03       And my mom's like, what are you talking about? What the fuck are you talking about? You know, like six or seven. What are you talking about man? I said I wanted a blow job. I gave her $20 and then she took my 20 hours. I'm gonna fucking kill him mom. And my mom's like, are you fucking crazy? Why would she suck? Get deck with $20 you can get other box. Why would she suck you a little helmet vic for $20 and shit you were, how old is it? Six seven. How old was she dairy too? When did Muhammad Ali fight Joe Frazier? The first time? 71 maybe [inaudible] 71 I was probably eight I was a little kid, man. Your money. Oh my mom had to give me back the 20 I made my mom get back to me. If mom gave it to you and my mom says, what would it take to make this problem disappear?

Speaker 8:          00:59:50       So she gave you 20 just to shut you up? Yeah, cause she knew I would help her teeth and asleep. I would kill it. And the sleep, she was sleeping on the couch, the babysitter fell asleep on the couch. This God, you give me the $20 I'm going fucking killer right there. Asleep. I was like are you fucking crazy? I'll give you the 20 just leave Quito alone. I didn't talk to Peter for a year. Doug, she never talked to her again. When was it? Yeah, one I was eight and she's ripping off little kids. She was great though. Data that group. Great. Babysit this girl now. I didn't like my mom going out at night. My mom had the bar so I would spend the whole day with my mom and then at night you'd have to go to the fucking bar and it would drive me crazy.

Speaker 8:          01:00:28       Joe, I want to go to the bar. Right. You can't go to the bar. You go to school. I don't give a fuck. Let me come protected size or weird. I would fucking wait for it to get the Jersey and I cause a war and the house and she'd have to get back in the car and come over the 88th street. Fuck me up, put me to sleep, getting in bed with me and laid down. And then she would go back to the bar and fucking close it. Hell man. Hell. And then when we moved in Jersey, I would call her up. I was scared at night cause I thought the house was haunted. So I would call her up and then you're going to get down there. I'd be crying and shit. Violence. You could just take a capital, your friend's house asleep over there. There was a year I didn't sleep at my house. You know, really like a year when I was in the seventh grade, I didn't sleep in my house. Never. I would go there after school, get clothes. I didn't go to my friends house and sleep there and lived there. I was scared of fucking ghosts and shit.

Speaker 4:          01:01:23       My grandparents insisted their house was haunted data guy. Uh, during the 50s, who rented a room upstairs. So local guy was a bachelor and he just rented a room because um, you know, people did that back then they were poor and uh, that guy died. I think he died while he's at the house. I don't remember. But they insisted that the fucking guy was still like walking around. They'd hear him walk around. I lived there for months when I first moved up to number and shit. Then I realized, you know what a lot of that is people just get bored. They want there to be a ghost. They want something crazy to be going on their board. They don't have any excitement. And so the only excitement is like being in that room in the dark and having feelings about something. It's not even real.

Speaker 8:          01:02:11       Oh, I feel something. I feel presence. I feel a presence. Something that's wrong, that's wrong. We can get the fuck out of this room. Oh, well, nothing happened. It's just you're in the dark. You're in the dark in an old house, but your board is, fuck. That's what it is. I don't know Joe. I don't know dog. I lived in, I want the fucking house. My mother bought this house in North Bergen, New Jersey. I'm given that terrorists, given that terrorist was originally to give it to that which one kids die. Wouldn't parents die and kids go, it was an orphanage to orphanage set fire in the forties so they took Charles Court and given that terrorist and build it over this orphanage. There was an article about it on facebook about six months ago, but the whole given that terrorist fucking spooky shit. Yeah. So in that house, my mother bought him.

Speaker 8:          01:03:04       The reason why my mom, my mom got in that with the alias was because who came in with a heavy cash and the guy killed himself in the garage. All right. The, I hung himself in the fucking 60 so skids was selling the fucking house. Well we didn't know about this. I never knew about this til years later. Once we moved in Lima. In the beginning I was going to Catholic school, so I only slept her on the weekends. Once I moved in full time. Like in the sixth and seventh grade was when I would hear that goes to at night and went Jan, I would hit them coming up the fucking status and shit and I would cry and yell. Right. So they sent me to the Santa Maria Lady's House and she told me to put a glass of water under my bed with a red towel on the top and I would sleep better, but I would still do your fucking noises at night.

Speaker 8:          01:03:47       I was fucking then, that's all. That's spooky shit. Now do you remember when we did Tom [inaudible] years ago and my friend called girl with y'all. We and I want to get coca. Okay. Her brother died on that block when he was 1615 he died on that block. This is silly ones. And if you think Cuban people are creepy with this Santa Rita and shit, nobody's creepier than old school Sicilians. I mean she broke it down. She kept telling me, I told him, my husband, Sicilians don't live on dead end streets because they're bad luck. Like they broke. Like when I see them now, they still fly out here, especially house and coming on. The streets are bad luck. Oh yeah. The Sicilians, I mean she's an old school Sicilian that she took the fish, the eyes from fishers to help people see better help people.

Speaker 8:          01:04:36       You ever see the movie sleepers? You ever see the movie sleepers? Which movies are sleepers heads explode? No. No. Let's scanners. The fucking heads explode. This is about 24 kids who rob up, hot dog man. And my mistake, a guy dies and they send them to a jail who was in, uh, look all star cast. Brad Pitt was the priest. I do go book is a lot better. The movies suck because they put too many stars in the movie. Too many. But that's about store fucking kids that gets sent to an orphanage and they get beat up or whatever the fuck it is. But before that they go to work for my boss. If you've ever watched any of mafia movie every month and blows the characters.

Speaker 5:          01:05:18       The only mobster that was ever any good in any Italian movie beside Marlon Brando was the guy that played the mobster and this movie put, see if he could fly asleep as King Benny King Manny was a bad motherfucker. He wasn't Italian Act that they recruited to come all week. I didn't even speak that good English. Wait till you see the king batty boy king baddies explained to him that he takes the eyeballs to this lady for headaches. When I was a kid looking at King Betty King Benny is a bad mobile fuck. Both a King Benny has to go deal with fucking brother's in Harlem and the guy says to a man, but you said this movie sucks dot movies or five but him, as you know, it was in this movie. You're Chubby Buddy, the guy you did softball with that Mike Star? No, the Spanish kid that you did that series with, he was a Spanish kid. Lombardi Puerto Rico or Puerto Rican get, Oh, I know who you're talking about. He played that well, he was last seen from that. See if he was in last. No, no, no. The kid, the Spanish gay plays fat. Moncho.

Speaker 5:          01:06:28       Hmm. So you have to have the scene from sleep. Is it the black guy when the black guy says to him, see if they have a scene from a movie that sucks. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. He says to them, God, look at you. You bring style to the game. The Italian guy goes, I can not help. You. Might Tailor is dead. I mean, this guy has got lines and this fucking movie and they never talk. He died years later, like they were saying, who the fuck is this guy? The guy is just a monster. Just my point is not about fucking sleepers or the fucking guy. What's the point? I have no idea. I'm seeing going. I'm like, I wonder how he's going to be talking about what we're talking about. We're talking about for kids and shit. Like, Whoa, oh, this is silly.

Speaker 5:          01:07:12       Are we talking about bad luck blogs? They just have a spooky beliefs. So they came to me years later and was telling me all about this block. How, how many people had, I had had bad luck on that block after that. Like the, the maloneys died from cancer. The both of them, you know the parents, the old rocks died from cancer. The girl across the street died in a car accident. Raul, I just robbed him. Raul and his family. I just took a stereo and they wouldn't let him in my fucking bedroom for years. How do you rob some of these houses? And I hung out with the kid cause he is later we became friends while they were moving in. I robbed Raul and his family and I took the stereo. Some kid took the fucking desk. It was amazing. And that would be talked to him anymore. Rau, old learner all ended up fucking moving to the bronx in the eighth grade. Over night they left. They owed money on the rent. So, but he would come through my house and go, can't we go to your room and listened to this time. It a good idea.

Speaker 5:          01:08:09       Hilarious.

Speaker 2:          01:08:12       Yeah.

Speaker 5:          01:08:12       Terrible. Do you ever look back on your past? Go, how the fuck did I become like an upstanding citizen? How did I become a regular person last night I was telling him these stories, so that was shaking. Well, I remember when I first met you, you were always a great guy, but you will, you are way more dangerous like you were. You're a dangerous person. You could do, you could do some ridiculous shit. You A, you were very volatile. There's a part of me that's a very, very nice law abiding person that really is as a part of me, that's always one of the try to be a nice person, but there's a part of me that does not comprehend a part of human behavior because it would not be alive. I was raised by no means at all. What do you mean? It's just stupid human behavior that I see everyday now I wouldn't know.

Speaker 5:          01:08:59       I say acceptable and how I was raised or how the people like rub her work. So when I look at that on behavior, my head explodes. I really can't handle it and I didn't. I got a beaten when I was 19. That was such a great beaten. It was worse than the one that been on Hopkins put on Felix Tryna dread. And that's the day I made my decision, my hand to hand combat days room like, God, I don't need this shit in my world. If you come into my world and get disrespectful, I'm going to hit you with a weapon. I'm gonna hit you with a chair or a bottle. I threw a lot of bottles in the store, a couple of glasses. He definitely throw some shit at the store. I don't fuck around with people because I don't like people fucking with me.

Speaker 5:          01:09:38       I'm really sensitive. I don't know how to handle it. But see, I think it's, it's one of the things we're talking about when we were talking about um, um, p people who go to war and how they get addicted to that feeling and then it's almost like, um, like that becomes their world. Right. Well, I almost feel like with, with some people they become, they become like real addicted to like bad situations. I was get addicted to drama is drama. Like you don't know how to handle life if there's no drama in your life. There was times I would rob Joe Rogan knowing that Joe Rogan knew I was on the rob and my state of mind was not what, not what not what you'd cause and they just, I didn't know how to live without the swirl of danger, you know, and let's be honest, the last 10 years I did blow and not because of an addiction.

Speaker 5:          01:10:36       The last 10 years I did blow up because I was addicted to that state of mind were always, you were always in need of something. The thrill was going to get the coat and driving them with the coke in the car. Yeah. That's something that you, when you told me that it was the first time anybody's ever articulated it that way, like what you are addicted to was not even necessarily the drug. It's the whole thing. The driving and little danger of danger. Police going to the guy's place to buy it, the cop, everything. I would look at myself after snoring at two three in the morning and see this person I didn't even recognize in the mirror. I wouldn't even want to look

Speaker 8:          01:11:14       at them cause I was so ashamed that I let that position take over my mind. It wasn't the fact of the call or the whatever. Are they getting my dick sucked or they're doing dirty things. It was the fact that drive and fronting it and all the scamming that went what? And somebody told me when I got locked up, they said, you think of all the time you put into scams thinking that you put that time into doing something on a positive level it, there's no surprise that my life has changed as much as I did without the drugs because 60% of your mental state was always in those drugs. Don't matter. For the other 40 was in comedy. The other 37 wasn't comedy and the other three was in God knows what the fuck it was. But 60% of your day is dominated by that addiction or whatever drives you and was some people, they've described it as like the addiction and having that addiction was like almost like a built in excuse to not live up to their full potential in anything to try and do.

Speaker 8:          01:12:13       Absolutely. You. Oh well for starters it's not, it's, it's the personal blame. You want that just in case if you fail, you always have a fucking excuse. Well, what'd you expect? I was having those problems those years. You didn't have any problem having a problem is when, uh, you know, you get fucking shingled floor or your family member has cancer. That's a problem that happens in life. The coke and all that shit is your own men. Men made dilemma. Are you with me? Like these are the things you create, all these things you create. You know, I think about that last year I did blow, I was ready to call 60 minutes. Like I think of this state of mind right now. Like I had already a pitch for 60 minutes to explain to them that I had found the cure for cocaine. That if you do heroin on Mondays just a little bit, you will not snort the rest of the week. Like I was really going to put 60 minutes. I was going to get an agent and go to CBS and go, listen, I got a groundbreaking idea. There's no reason for rehabs. We'll get that white powder. You motherfuckers are going to war for it

Speaker 8:          01:13:19       and we'll get that little white poppy seed. We'll make it into some pill and we'll get people high on Monday cause the rest of the week. I didn't want to get high. How crazy that I was doing heroin on a Monday and it wouldn't let me do coke the rest of the week. I look forward to Mondays. Fuck CSI Miami. Why only Monday? I Dunno. I Dunno. I have no fucking idea. That was just the guy that was just a snorting it. Yeah, snoring at two little lines of heroin just to get me out. And what does it do? Like what's the feeling? Hit? Tell me what it feels like when it hits you. Well, it takes a couple of minutes to hit you and you feel this weird thing and then you feel like your blood pressure going up and you feel like this euphoric warmth. You feel like this fucking warmth. I felt like my body. Do you ever take a wet shit? It's warm and you could see if you shit outside steams gonna come out of it. That's what your body feels like that warm. And then I would get an urge to puke

Speaker 8:          01:14:18       for a couple of minutes. I would gag and Puke a little bit would come out of yellow and then after I puked a little bit, I would just go into this state of fucking Mona's for four hours. It was like smoking in because all day and like just sitting there smoking cigarettes, looking at a window and I'd make believe I was writing John Lennon type lyrics to jokes until I looked at them the next day. This brilliance about a refrigerator. Like I remember writing a bit about a refrigerator once and looking at it the next day and say thank God, thank God I never tried it. You know what I'm saying? Like little things like just, well that was hedbergs drug of choice and his jokes,

Speaker 7:          01:14:59       man. I mean

Speaker 1:          01:15:01       it's, I think he's probably the best nonsequitor joke I ever because all his jokes are unrelated. It's like, here's a non sequitur. Here's some other things I was thinking about. Here's something I thought, here's how I saw. And it was like I was listening to it the other day. He was like, half of his jokes were only funny because he was saying them, you know? But they were hilarious like he had, he had a way of doing it that was kind of like heroin comedy, you know,

Speaker 8:          01:15:32       you be messed up during the week or no. Ooh. Ah. It takes me a day to recover. On Tuesdays I'd be out, I didn't say nothing to nobody. I was doing the heroin and I wasn't doing coke. It was really fun. So you would be like sober Thursday, Friday, Saturday. And then he'd look forward to the big bump on Monday. Yeah. That kid, he used to send it to me. He used to send me $7 bags. What kid? His name was a bonehead. He died from an old date. How weird. Yeah, figure that was going to live forever. I knew own head. I knew bonehead from Ohio. My rest and peace loss bone had broken the taste. Some of my bone had boneheaded was like your boy. He was. I could go into a room with 90 motherfuckers and bone that little like a date. That bonus was a bad motherfucker dog.

Speaker 8:          01:16:21       I love bump bonding. Her three brothers, I love Dalton, but bone. That was two of the brothers were very successful. I believe in not bonehead was successful as a plumber. He has his own company. He only went to crazy at night bone. That bone it when I was 17 would take me to mcsorley's hell house in New York City. Don't want Id. He called the bartender. I'm going to give them three mugs of beer and give him three mugs or be and give them a bowl of Chili mug. Ed would take 10 bucks for the both of us and he'd go to Washington Square Park and he'd come back and he'd give me a balance and by the meantime he would go by his heroin and they buy these mixture of pills and even melt them to the black and whites. They take us to a strip club in New Jersey or something and they'd take us home and the next day, seven in the morning, they'd strip this.

Speaker 8:          01:17:09       There's bone head in the fucking in the fucking a plumbing van up. And Dan that he was a functioning addict. He wasn't like your regular, there's a lot of those guys out there. And he had a chick that was a 13 bailey, she was half Asian, half Irish. Good. They used to do heroin together and they'd pass out in the living room. Wait, fuck. And they both go to sleep and then I'd be in the bedroom cause I just moved that were bonus family. Okay. They were Italian Bro. They were real fucking Italians and I, the mother used to, the mother was the first person who ever made me an that grant. She was a little Irish chicken. She said that she used to say the word Earl, she couldn't say oil and she was the bookkeeper for union 52 whatever the teamsters, the Labor is unit.

Speaker 8:          01:18:00       You know, I was over there one day when I was 16 she goes, you got a book, not walk me to work tomorrow. Get your book. You could stop fucking being a hottie. So I, you know like a hod carrier, like hod carrier for brick masons. And she goes, I can get you with the Italians over by the brick mason cause she was from hoboken. So she got me a book. I financed that. She got a loan shark to finance it. I loved these people. This is, if I'm thinking of Mike, I don't like doing documentaries, but I needed to do a documentary about this family because it's the rise and fall of it in American families. I saw before my eyes as a child, I went over there and ate with them. You know, I hung out with all three brothers by the way.

Speaker 8:          01:18:41       Like I wasn't just friends or bone had I not with Chrissy fish. And I hung out with the little, whatever his name was, but bonehead was my nighttime guy. Bonehead used to take me into the murky waters of the underworld. He could get me guns are shooting of the medium. Brother was a drug dealer in the 80s and he drunk. He sold big times coke and he used to buy jewelry. He used to put them in the tackle box. So one night me and the younger brother in the bed, sleep and bone had comes in to borrow money from us because he was going to this. They get heroin and he goes and I go bone it. I got to go to the back of the time, the money on me. He went into his brother's room and instead of his brother was sleeping, the drug dealer, instead of just opening up the tackle box and taking $40 down, he took the whole tackle box and it has 40,000 in cash and the other 30 and jewelry, he went to the Bronx.

Speaker 8:          01:19:31       These are the best times of my life. Once you go by comrade, this is the best time, like your war stories, and he thought the house was haunted. This was not a haunted house at all. These people were decent Italian people. Dad was a longshoreman and the mom was in charge of the teamsters union and they hung out with westies. They hung out with the fucking, the mother was friends with this dude that was a a whatever for the West East and he used to get me jobs. He would get me jobs. Casing joints. You know when you have a summer job? Nah. He would tell me, come in, I want you to go in that warehouse. I'm going to give you 200 and they're going to give you one 80 I want you to go in that warehouse and write down all the alarms and Tommy where the safe is, who walks around the safe and he would pay me money.

Speaker 8:          01:20:12       This is a great house, old school, Italian house, but back the bone, that bone, it has the fishing tackle box. He's about to go upstairs to buy heroin and shoot it. He puts the tackle box and the garbage can in front of the building and puts a lid on it. When he's upstairs shooting heroin, the garbage bin come and they'd take the 40 large with the 30,000 and fucking jewelry to understand me. I mean, this was nonstop. Another night, boneheaded came home high on heroin. He decided to make French fries. So he put the pot out better than they remember in the 80s they had those pots. You could bring it home with the hot oil and they would boil and you can throw French fries. America went crazy over him. I forgot what they were. Praised everybody, French fry machines. Everybody was making an onion rings and shit.

Speaker 8:          01:20:58       Well, he did the heroin and not up and it at the thing went on fire. We're of course, we're all on the fucking house. Oh, Jesus. All right. I went to boil. I wake up to buy boom and alarms and awesome. Kurt's waking me up and we'd go out of the house and the father's outside and the grandmother and the fire department crawls on top of the roof. Joe when they hit the fucking roof to let the smoke out and fire trucks are coming from the side lane ward and they got the sirens in the middle of all this, the tate in the morning and we all look around and go, oh my God, Emile still in the house. Bonehead was still in the house on fire, Bro. They turn the fire off, they go in and he's still with his feet up.

Speaker 5:          01:21:37       When his hands draw just heroin. Dad of his mind, he slept through the fire. Oh my God. Everything. When they woke up, he goes on my fries. This is how crazy this family was. We have to fucking battalions out there. We got half of nine 11 out. You still fucking sleeping. Oh my God. It burned the house down. Burn the fucking kitchen down and have the bedroom. They had to move to a hotel for six months and they had [inaudible] the grandmother

Speaker 8:          01:22:12       downstairs, it was old school Italian, but she couldn't smell. So we Kinda, we smoked pot. We'd just go down there and blow smoke in her face and grandma would pass out in the wheelchair and that was the end that, I mean it didn't stop. It didn't stop genes. So this is why you get mad at people for binge watching stuff on Netflix and this is what you were talking about. I get mad at everything. What are you going to bother me for? I get mad when people like he used to hide the coke. The medium brother used to hide the coke under his car and I'd be walking down the hill and I can see a little container and that he didn't even have a Maserati. What's the other Italian call? This is how much of a guineas these motherfuckers were. What's the other Italian car like you said? The avanti Avanti. Oh, okay. I remember those. Remember that piece of shit that was a piece of shows up pieces of shit. And you show me a piece of carbon trust to anything Italian. Oh my God. That was the, he tried to sell it to me once. It like 20

Speaker 5:          01:23:06       I give it to you for two grants. Yeah. I drive it down. The corner blows up. Like I feel like if you buy a Ferrari, I feel like if you drive that thing, it's going to fall apart. I'm black. I like, I trust German cars, you know, I don't trust people like me making cars. What's the other one? The other one that Lamborghini is that tally those things fall apart? Do they really guarantee you just look at them. There's no way that starts the ugliest fucking call. And it was actually Lamborghini's don't wound by Audi, so who knows? They might be like much better engineered now I'm talking shit obviously.

Speaker 7:          01:23:42       Okay.

Speaker 5:          01:23:42       I don't know that much about things other than uh, I know a lot about porsches, but there's a lot of cars I don't understand about, but God, those things are disgusting. The avanti, when a piece of shit disgusting sought us out to me for two grand 30 look at that thing. It's crazy. Lamborghinis or like the biggest like here's my Dick Carr. You can get right. That's the closet. I, they had the doors open up sideways. You walk out of that naked. Like, if I had that car, just walk on with my dick out. Like what bitches put up $20 bills as you go. I can get a mic jock strap. Oh, your boys sent this.to Syrah. Sent this fanny packs. Oh really? I got my fanny pack to the Brim with Reed. He's got giant fanny pack. Those are great for anybody and they fit me the way really good for the travel on the road.

Speaker 5:          01:24:31       You can get a lot of stuff and um, yeah, no, no, that's true. You glasses your license and your passport. Oh yeah. Well you don't have my plane tickets. Canadians. They have to come down to America to see you and they have a great time. Don't get me wrong. It's a road trip. That's what I do in Buffalo. Buffalo, Toledo. I tried to really give me money for Seattle, Detroit, Detroit. I do grand harbor, grand rapids, grand rapids. I'm trying to get the handle on it, but next year. And I remember we did that once. Did I do that? I did that once with, uh, I think Ari, I ain't no harbor back in the day. That's a college town, right? The comedy club down there yet. You did it with something. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, I did it with the girl. You came back and told me to call you like gold called them. Yeah. Fun People. Fun. Fucking club fun. Yeah. There's some good spots where people can come down. The Canadians can come down like, well, he can't do Seattle either.

Speaker 5:          01:25:30       Ugh. I can't do, I know who he is. The word fucking tear Seattle apart. So sad he can't get into Washington state. There's still breaking my balls too. Can you work that out? I thought you already had that almost two years ago. You don't want men, they want a bunch of cash and they still want me to go up there and surrender myself, so fuck all that. I'm not surrendering myself. I ain't fucking surrendering yourself. What does that even mean? Come on in and turn yourself in and we'll put you through the process. 12 hours in the holding thing and I shit, that ain't going

Speaker 8:          01:26:04       to King County fucking jail for that shit. 12 hours in a holding tank. It's not like you're some threat to society. Why do they have to put you in a holding tank? What kind of weird formality is that? Like sorry, we have to cuff you. Well wait a minute. You know I'm not and I have no failure to appears like I've, I've always gone to court. I never, I don't have a failure. I even went to court with an alias. Like I used an alias one time when I got arrested, that's the class I got. I covered the spread. When they arrested me, I gave him like Joe Rogan's name and not so you wouldn't get a warrant. I went down and did the 16 hours community service in the age of unit painting for the age people. So next time you look at me and tell him he ain't got no fucking character, think of that.

Speaker 8:          01:26:45       And 10 years later I go to eat dinner with that guy and he's like, can I have a Tan? I got pulled over and I had a warrant in Colorado. I got, we got the rest of them Colorado for shoplifting. No Way. I just kept eating my fucking meal but at least he didn't get arrested cause it's fucking time proof. I did my fucking thing. That is so ridiculous. You imagine getting arrested in boulder. I think about the words you told me about boulder once you go. I was driving into boulder and my wife and I kept thinking this must've been a candy store for Joey did.

Speaker 9:          01:27:15       Yeah.

Speaker 8:          01:27:15       How do you get arrested? They let you out without a life. They're all like barefoot. Yoga people listened to me. I was in jail for three weeks as Jose Diaz waiting bail for kidnap me. I sat in there from December, from November 18th to December like ninth to 10th I had the jail. Why'd you do know that? You do know that I could just go up to the gardens I need to make along with business call and he let me out. Everybody else had a sign the list. You do know that when I was smoking weed and then I had all access to cool lake, cause I don't like, I hate fucking milk. I like Mo shakes. Not Know I had all access. Do you know I got arrested three months? Not even Joe Rogan. I got the rest of the month after I made bail and they put me back in that jail and I went back as Jimmy and everybody was calling me Jimmy. No, no, no, no. My name, I'm the fingerprint was the alias and their fingerprint and me calling me Joey doing joey. How's it been lately? I see you're back in here. Meanwhile, on that card it blatantly says Jimmy. So they didn't read the card? No, they just assumed it was you. But you went in with someone else's. Yeah. And then what happened? And then I called the girl, they said, we can't let you out without a license. So your driver's license, yet I didn't even have the license for that name.

Speaker 8:          01:28:38       In those days, there was no paperwork on me at all. If you, if you arrested me, guess

Speaker 9:          01:28:44       always like jeopardy. Right. And here's your chance to beat jeopardy. You get no prices.

Speaker 8:          01:28:49       I never carry the license on me in those days till till this day. I hate that bulge in my pocket. I fucking hate it. So what you do? So I wouldn't bring an idea with me so I can be anybody. When you were arrested, how could it be a fucking penguins? Well you fucking so you just had nothing on nothing. So they made me call. So I called my girlfriend at the time and I go, hey, how you doing? This is James. She was like, Ooh, I go, this is James. I took you out to dinner a couple of weeks ago. I lost my license. She's like, what the fuck are you talking about? I'm just a cops right there. I'm like, I lost my fucking license and these cops won't let me out one unless somebody comes down here and lets me, I'm not, she knew the kid, I was talking about you following me.

Speaker 8:          01:29:30       She always heard me talking about him. I said, James, James, James, James, James. And she goes, Okay James, this last name. And I go, yeah. And she went down there and they brought her in. They said, what's his name, James, where does he live? She told them and they go, okay, we'll let you out. That was it. They gave me paperwork and four days later I turned myself in. I went, I stood in court, I got charged. I pled guilty because I didn't want to fuck with it. I didn't want to take a chop with things. Think the trial they had me and I fucking did the uh, community service at the age unit under this guy's name, under this guy's name, that 16 hours of the fucking, the community corrections. But I met a cop that was there. So see everything works itself out and throw the other, because when I was there, there was a cop that would do a detail that in those days, the police age, that AIDS unit was getting death threats from like militant people in Boulder.

Speaker 8:          01:30:27       The people up in the hill and they had a cop there and I would talk to the cop every day, talk to the cop a little bit, hey, how you doing officer? And we'd talk about this or that, and one day I got into a beef, I had two felonies and my ex fucking boyfriend thought he was tough for me and I said, you know what? I got to smack this guy, but if I could get them, I got to get them good. And I went to meet him and I fucking smack them. I guess it was the first cop on the job, the dude from the AIDS unit. This guy's holding onto his face. He came, he asked me, Charlie, what happened? I told him the truth. They gave me a ticket. So life is his circle of my foot kind of ticket. They get for slapping someone.

Speaker 8:          01:31:06       He got a ticket to, he got a ticket, I got a misdemeanor assault and he got using a racial slur outside the city limits of boulder. Oh, is that really the case? That's a really cool is always been like that. Yeah, because the football players and 85 those football players that were really powerful that that those teams that won the national championship, there was always beef with them in boulder. The cops always had beef with them. So there was one, there was a couple of incidents. It was Kuneva Magee. He just smacked them motherfuckers. I ball out of his head. I told those, you think I'm kidding, I'm not cracking jokes. He broke his eye socket six foot five to 45 well that smack with a smack Jesus. Oh Stockton slap I ball went out of his fucking head weight made money, had a ring on. And then another lady called Jj Flanigan a nigger and he punched her in the face. So they dropped the, because she

Speaker 5:          01:32:00       said a racial slur. That's hilarious. So when a woman can call a guy in and just get punched in the face, oh he slapped the, so they call it the Jj Flannigan rule. So like God is so crazy. When I got arrested for that racial thing, I told him, he called me a Spec what she did in front of my daughter.

Speaker 5:          01:32:18       So I smacked him. So wait a minute. Did the football player smacker or puncher thank you smack that Jj Flanagan. That's a street corner in the bolt and Pearl Street mall is something that's how strong that word is just smack. And Zoe is the only word that it has a letter. Like you could kind of say the f word, but most people say fuck. But he was still, this is still 88 this is 88 this is named d. These are the times when they would come down and see you football, you know? But they had a lot of shit going on. Like there's a document, there's a 30 for 30 Oh really? Okay, great. Let me ask you this, why do you think boulder has always been so liberal?

Speaker 5:          01:32:54       Because they want to be, they had that right to be, these are people that want to live, you know the boulder now I'm others will go set him. So Santa Monica, it's the same fucking people. What do you mean it's the same people? That was not the bold and when I got there in 1980 not even close. What's the difference? I don't know. What the gentiles, you know, starbucks, that's not what blogging was. Stalls to be. Boulder was totally brought up to be anti very much establishment. Very uh, you know, people who have soap companies, right? People who have shirts with designs of the grateful dead. But that's what it is. Right? If that's what it is, let that be that. Well there's a bunch of people in Boulder, it'll just go democrat no matter what, which means they just vote Democrat. Oh No, they don't vote Republican ever.

Speaker 5:          01:33:46       So like when I was there, it was, it was during the Obama election after he got elected for the first term is when I was there. And uh, I was like this, it's so weird that there's so many different people that have the same thing on their front lawn. It's Obama, Obama, Obama like everywhere you look, he didn't see any Republican candidates on anybody's launch. So you just didn't see that. What is the rest of Colorado like? Way Republican, way more republican rest of Colorado is like cowboys and shit. Denver's kind of a mixture. DENVER, you get a little bit of everything cause it's sort of like Austin, Texas, like that sort of like no, no, no because Austin is more like cowboy funky. Austin's different. Austin is like a lot of bad ass music comes from Austin fucking Gary Clark Jr comes from Austin. But the state of mine of Wash of Boulder and Austin were pretty much similar representing that the states. But you can't compare them because most there's only a hundred thousand people. It's tiny ass place. Austin's a million. What's the population of of bold? 100,000 still. It's tiny bates camp build. They don't let you build. They got that place locked down. Well that's what I'm saying. They always buy up open space. Boulder always

Speaker 1:          01:34:58       wanted to be different than everybody else. Yeah. When I first went to boulder, I first peaked at Boulder July of 83 and I was like, I'll never come to this fucking place too boring. But I was from New York City Guy Get us the population Jagan find it was an all of a sudden I'm dealing with pizzas and slept on a mattress about 300,000 but it's 100,000 the Metros 300,000 Oh, okay. So it's about you hundred thousand weight [inaudible] we doing stepping back to chew. You were in the middle of the store. Yeah. Boston's a totally different animal. Austin as much more like a, I just meant in the way like Texas is right repo. Yeah, yeah, yeah, for sure. But there's a lot of Republicans in Austin. Austin's not entirely liberal. Austin's a mixture. It's a weird mixture. Boulder's not much of a mixture. Bolger like Greg for Tim and said it best.

Speaker 1:          01:35:51       He's like, it's just too one note. He liked a denver because uh, we were talking about like how amazing Colorado is and he did a weekend at the comedy works. He's like, you know what, I could fucking live here. He goes, I don't really say that about many places, but I could live there. And we were talking about bolder and he's like, I think bold is just a little too one note. They're a little too college influenced, Super Liberal, social justice, Warrior type, Vegan, barefoot, handcrafted, all that nonsense. You know, there's like a lot on the People's Republic of Boulder. That's what they call it. Leap is Republic of Boulder Place. Yeah. Oh, it's listening to me. He's folding the traction. They're very nice people at that time in my life. Bold or just meant something to me. It meant peace of mind. I Dunno. I don't know what the place itself is so fucking beautiful.

Speaker 1:          01:36:42       I mean, you're there in the foothills of the rocky mountains and you just sit sometimes he just like, you'd go to boulder, he just, what's that street? That Mall Street Pearl. Pearl Street. Pearl Street Mall. And when you just look up and you see and you're looking at fucking, he leave the street and you look up, you're looking at like mountains. So rocky mountains right there. Like you're in this beautiful, amazing spot and the people, it's not that many people. I think that's a big thing. I think when you get too many people in a, in a place that gets annoying that you fucking don't appreciate each other as much. Just too many fucking people. There's 3 million people has grown a lot since I left Hawaii, Florida. It has butters, can't grow much more than it's already grown. What they've done is amazing. His bio up so much open space and make it super difficult to put up apartment buildings and people like that's bullshit.

Speaker 1:          01:37:30       We need affordable housing. Drive to boulder, stupid fuck drive there just fucking be part of the Denver Metro areas included in that 300,000 that's okay. Arvada and places like that. Well it's like, uh, it's awesome. Longmont, Longmont, Lafayette, you know what's the hidden gem? Evergreen Evergreen's this is the shit. God Damn, they have some views. Evergreen has some ridiculous views or you just tucked in with like this giant elk herd that walks down through the middle of town, got a giant elk herd walking through the middle of the street and a buddy of mine moved there and he was living in Vegas before and he, and you know, he was asking him about Colorado. I said, you've got to check out evergreen. And he, he went there once, bought a house, immediately moved. And uh, he texted me that these elk, they get in the middle of the street and someone who was from out of town apparently was like beep in and trying to get the elk out of the road and like revving his engine and cause he was in a rush and some old cowboy got out of his truck, walked up to dude's car window, punched him through the car window and then got back in his truck, get sick because the guy was harassing the helicopter.

Speaker 1:          01:38:46       Yeah, that's no joke, dude. That's really what happens in evergreen. This is a herd of elk walking down the middle of the street and you can't do a God damn thing about it. And because the people in the town itself, I mean they don't really hunt them when they do that. So the, the, the elk feel super calm about walking on the highway in front of everybody because if they were in the woods with you like that, they would fucking bolt of, they saw a person, they smelled you, they would bolt. But meanwhile these things have chosen to go like by the road. It's interesting too because they, they don't recognize people as predators in those situations. It's like people around urban areas aren't predators, but people in the mountains are predators. It's real weird. So for generations that like [inaudible] group of Alex has just been walking down the street.

Speaker 1:          01:39:32       Yeah. Unbelievable. It's crazy. Not only that, um, I mean that's the case everywhere. Like in yellowstone, there was a, a video that someone sent me today. I didn't, I don't think I retweeted it. Um, someone send me, I didn't watch him, I wasn't getting self service, but there's a video that someone sent me today about some woman and got too close to an elk in yellowstone. I guess it was real recently, but mo for the most part, they don't worry about people they're wearing about wolves and grizzly bears and shit. So they see a person they go, cause no one's hunted in yellowstone for over a hundred years. So elk see people there and they were like, what's up dude? How you doing? Man? Got some carrots for me. Is this it? Yeah. Yellowstone elk decides a woman's too close for comfort. Yeah, go, go, go.

Speaker 6:          01:40:11       Oh, oh, oh no. Oh No. Oh yes. Did you get that on video? Oh. Oh,

Speaker 1:          01:40:16       she just got launched

Speaker 6:          01:40:23       ma'am. Could you please? Oh yeah. Oh yes.

Speaker 1:          01:40:27       Video. I didn't get it. Look, she, she went salen

Speaker 6:          01:40:30       the video. Whoa, you're too close to got out. And that's why 25 yards, ma'am.

Speaker 1:          01:40:47       Thank you sir. That's the, I just got humbled, sir. That's a certain kind of, sir. Have you seen the video of the hunter getting beaten by a whore? A deer? Yeah. Saying this, there's a bunch of hits in the face. A Dell, they'll fuck you up. Especially in the Rut. They're horny and they think you cock blocking them. They get mad. Jack, you are you sure? Oh yeah. Did people died from deer? A lot of people had died because they get gored like the, you know, they're hot. They're either hunting homer there, hiking him or what for whatever reason they may be like that lady, they get stupid. Like she was lucky that that was either a cow elk or that was an elk that didn't have antlers yet cause they shed their antlers and then the grown back. Um, so she got lucky cause if that was a big bull elk, there's one, this one, this is the one I saw.

Speaker 1:          01:41:31       He just kicked him. That guy has dog shit Jujitsu. First of all should be spinning for one of those rear legs. You try to get them in a heel hook on that real. I, I, uh, comorbid a deer's lag and snapped it in half after it was already dead. I was trying to, I was like, I wonder if this would work. A deer snapped its leg when Callan and I and went hunting in Montana. So I feel real confident that I could heal. Hook a deer. Fuck it up. Have you lost your fucking deal? I take us back. Take us back. Take that fucking, then you're in the hospital with a ball.

Speaker 1:          01:42:09       By the way. My fault. Probably just recovering right now. Yeah. He's in the hall in the hospital today and he got his, his discs replaced. How long does that take now? Um, I don't think the operation is, uh, just a few hours and I'm, the recovery time is a ridiculously low. I think a, in six weeks he's allowed to start lifting weights. So six weeks, his body has to heal up. So I'm talking out of school cause I don't know the exact procedure, but I know this is what he told me is that they're replacing a disk with a titanium disk. They have some sort of a new technology in disc replacement where they used to take the disc out and then they would fuse it together. Right now instead they'll put an artificial disc and it's supposed to be just as good as um, uh, a real desk.

Speaker 1:          01:42:58       And the difference being that like when they would fuse those discs, it would limit your mobility pretty drastically because you don't have any articulation in between the two joints a now that they have this artificial disk that aren't dead, artificial disc actually moves around and it allows your spine to be flexible. So I'm one of the guys from school, Victor got it done and apparently he's never been better and it feels great. No pain at all. And it was bothering him for a long time and Eddie's been bothering his for almost as long as I've known him cause he does so much stuff from his back. You know, it's all guard work and it's getting stacked all the time and compressed all the time and not, you know, not the most diligent about stretching the back out early in his career. You know, just he take your stretching before and after you who you definitely should warm up before.

Speaker 1:          01:43:46       Um, but the big thing is mobility, mobility, training meaning, um, doing things like bending down, grabbing the back of your heel with your four fingers on both sides and trying to put your pinkies together and then extending your legs and you're popping your back and stretching your back. For me, that's big. Hanging by your ankles as big and he sort of decompression anything that alleviates pressure. I have one that I put on my neck and it's like I'm hanging myself and go click, click, click, click, click, click, click. And I'm like literally hanging a good, good percentage of my weight from my neck. Then I have a bunch of them in the back. I have different, uh, decompression devices in the back. I've got the reverse hyper, which strengthens your back. And also it's like an active, moot moving decompression of the bag that's created by that.

Speaker 1:          01:44:33       Uh, Louie Simmons guy that from a west side, barbell, just genius guy. He had a back injury too and you needed to get it fixed and they were going to, they wanted to cut him and he was like, ah, I think I can figure this out. I think there's gotta be an exercise. It strengthens this instead of surgery. And so that's what he came up with. But see in Eddie's position, don't even know if that would have helped because Eddie's was so far gone. He didn't have any disc left. There was like, there's nothing there. You know what? I'll burrow those. They do look 12 o'clock class then at one 15 it's a mobility class for half hour. And I said that Kettle Jitsu guy. No, but isn't there a guide? Yes. Now, but he's got tip, tick, fit, tick, fit. He's got tick fit. What does that mean?

Speaker 1:          01:45:11       Tick fit? Is that new training with the bats? How'd he say tick? How do you spell it? T I see fit I think. Huh? Take fit. And it's the stuff with the bat. Okay. Like Eskrima like that kind of stuff. No one is police baton. What do they have happen on it now? What do they do for, oh, oh, you mean macy's? Like Steel Mace or on a club? They have the club. Phillip were playing charades. The club. The club on the metal club. Yeah, it was great. It was something with a club and they have a class at nine. Oh, okay. And then they have a class at one and they have a class at six 30 what he's been doing lately, he's like, you know what man? My one's been like, why did I come out here and do mobility with you guys from one 15 to one 45 I feel like class warmed up and ready after Jujitsu and he just does, you know, a squat.

Speaker 1:          01:46:01       Touch the ground, lift your foot down and go up and switch legs. You know, just stuff like that. Six exercises, three minutes with a, with a thing and you're out of that. You're stretching your rob, then it's no, no big deal. I mean, you break a sweat on some of them, you know, downward dog to something else into it and do push up. We know it's problem with Jujitsu is that it's fun. And when it's fun, you're going in there and getting smashed all the time and the overall look, you don't give yourself a lot of time to recover from those rolling sessions and there's a lot of little micro injuries and those rolling sessions and some of those micro injuries become chronic. After awhile. Like Eddie's back or like for me it was my neck just like over and over again. You're doing the same thing over and over again. You're out sore the next day. Just keep training, you keep crying. He'd developed scar tissue. Your disks get compressed and then you start weird shit like

Speaker 5:          01:46:49       numbness like some guys get like numb feet like a cade. My friend. Kay. Does lower leg is still numb. Still Numb. Yeah. My hands, I was getting numb hands, bas rutten's got it. Like a whole, his whole like neck area is fucked. He's had several surgeries in his neck and his, he's get at least two disks, maybe three discs frozen and, and, and, and fucking like the, the disks are removed and the, the bones are fused in his neck. I tried to take a day in between except with days that I have to go on the road. The weeks I'd have to go on the road, I want to get three. And so I just do it Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and got on a plane Thursday. But the weeks I'm in town all week I'll do Monday, Wednesday and Friday. And then sometimes like this week I did Sunday and I went Monday. But Sunday is very light.

Speaker 5:          01:47:38       It's just a three minute roles and guard pass past stuff. He's a great guy. He doesn't really hate Mondays. Wednesdays and Fridays are hard. Wednesdays, Sundays I go cause the guy is just so great. Technically I always learn one little stupid thing, you know, just one little stupid thing. Your role like two or three times in your out of that. Right. So I always tried to take, he was, if I want to go that day, even if I feel okay and I'm not sore, I'll take the day off because I don't want to go every day. I don't want to do that. You know, I'll do a light kettlebell workout or something. But then there's other people that think you just keep doing it and eventually body hardens up. Yeah. I don't know. It's uh, it's, it's, it depends. I guess it depends on how you approach it.

Speaker 5:          01:48:21       I know bordain does it every day. The trains every day sometimes does twice a day until it, he'll take a private and then I'll take a group class. Well, it's an, it's an age thing. It's to time barrier and it's also, um, like for me, it's the weight. You know, when you judo throw me, it's 300 pounds. It's driving the five. You do that 10 times. The next day something's going to be rattled in my fucking head. Right. Okay. Last week we had a guy, Rick Gay Machado. He's Jack or race coach and the Amazon. You got to take Wayne, uh, boke and a fucking bicycle. You know what I'm like, I'm not, I'm not trying to be cute. It's true. We had our burden on him. I'm about, Britta was saying that the one place in Brazil that you got to train 10 hours, then you've got to walk a mile.

Speaker 5:          01:49:09       Then you've got to go across and one of these things, there's some days somebody would steal the paddle. Can you imagine Jesus? 10 hours a fucking fucking around our mile walk and now some of these steals the fucking battle. I can't even battled through my fucking house and there was shit in the water and there was shit. No water cause that the house, the sewage would go into the water. Oh Jesus. No, no, no, no, no. And then you wonder why they got Zika and everybody's head's getting big in Brazil and shit. It was small. That's what I'm now how's, uh, I think that's what they gave Jose Aldo is to fight against mcgregor, the Zika virus. They're all fucked up. They had them crying after the show that had a camera in the room.

Speaker 4:          01:49:48       I'm telling you, Dana, find a way to give them the Zika virus is shit. Imagine how bad the population would be if there was no viruses. If there was no diseases, diseases didn't kill anybody. I mean, how many people are killed? Let's just take a guess. How many people are killed every year by disease?

Speaker 4:          01:50:05       Let's guess 2 million, 3 million. How many people you think probably around there, but it's not in America. I think it's in like, right. Did she get that picture? By the way of that, that a ladder and China, China kids were climbing at places like that. Like it's like a 2000 foot bamboo ladder that like six year olds are climbing up. Why are they doing that? It's the only way to get to their town. So I think that, yeah. Have you seen that Jamie? Jesus Christ. A 2000 foot ladders. It might not be feed. It might be. Look at this. Oh my God. Children in China would climb 2,500 foot cliff to get to school, maybe given stairs. Oh, pussies. They're six years old. So it's pulling like this. Look at this dude. They're climbing with their backpacks on you. Imagine sending your little baby and your baby has to climb 2,500 feet on this Janky ass wooden ladder that looks like it was made when Columbus was sailing. Cut. Fucking wanky. That ladder looks, that's insane. See if there's any other pictures that is fucking bananas. Oh well was poor kids. They got a hard look in their face, man.

Speaker 4:          01:51:19       Jesus, that's so crazy. I wonder, do you know there's one fucking weak ass bitch kid that starts crying. They meg and then he falls. I was everyone down. Not In China, not in China. They don't make it. They don't make it. Those kids don't make it. That has been Nana's. So yeah, I think it's places like this where people are dying of viruses cause you don't, you never really hear about it in America that often. Well people definitely die of the flu here in America. That's still happening. I bet thousands of people die every year from the flu. But as far as how many people die from diseases worldwide? I'm going to say every year. I want to say 20 million. How many? How many people? It depends on like what kind of disease cause there's lots of disease. Cardiovascular disease. Oh yeah. It was different. But that's like, that's just like poor health.

Speaker 4:          01:52:08       It says 2012 an estimated 56 million people died. Just died in America. The whole world? No, no. 56 million. 1 million in the hole. It was America. That'd be like in one year. That'd be a sixth of the country. That wouldn't happen just America but in the whole world only 56 million people at a 7 billion. And the either estimation I didn't, they can't count on it. Would you have guessed that that would be what it was? Uh, I don't know. I would have thought I'd been way higher. What would you think? Like pre or like how many people die in the year? Actually I think 56 million is a pretty big number. If you really stop, think about it. And they're not counting anybody in Africa. No good luck. Certainly people in Canada that's twice that at least twice I guess. That makes sense.

Speaker 5:          01:52:54       When you say disease, this is HIV, syphilis and Medina crabs, flu, Zika, Zika. I don't think Zeke is really killing many people just fucks up. Kids just really fucks women up when they, when they get apparently you can get and not even know you have it. Get pregnant at fucks your kid up.

Speaker 4:          01:53:16       Non Communicable disease is responsible for 38 million of those. Okay, so that's like heart disease and cardiovascular. 11.6 million. But I want, I want, what I'm interested in is like malaria and shit like that. HIV, uh, decreased slightly from 1.7 deaths and 2 million to 1.5 million sold in 2000 or 200,000 less. 1.5 million people die every year from HIV. Diarrhea is no longer among the top five leading causes of death. Diarrhea and aid.

Speaker 5:          01:53:50       Neck and neck people die from diarrhea. Chorus. Yeah, they get dehydrated. But how bizarre is it that that aids kills that many people? HIV deaths decreased 1.7 million to 1.5 million in 2012. That's still crazy. Like when was the last time you heard about someone in America dying from HIV?

Speaker 5:          01:54:15       You don't hear about it very often. They say complications and they usually just something later. It gets a deficiency is something that, yeah, that definitely can be it. You don't, my uncle got whatever we cancer four years ago. Dot. Whatever with cancer. He got diagnosed with cancer. Okay. Crazy one on west. Really? When I pulled the gun on, you know he's still alive. That happens. No Chemo. What does he do? Change his whole diet. No sugar. Everything is organic. Really. Everything is organic. Everything was Vegan and what happened? He's still alive. He still works the door on his bar. He just bitch slap somebody. About three months ago, he still walks five miles a day. Griffith Park and he still gets the bag for now. What's his cancer like to get it checked out or it's just this fuck. This is from testosterone. Cancers from testosterone with testosterone.

Speaker 5:          01:55:05       Since he was 35 he had three households going. It's got three households going. What do you mean? He had the wife and the kid, oh this year told me that he cheated on her. He had the hook her for 30 years who we still has a relationship with and then he fucked her cousin. She had a kid that lives in the backyard. Boris. I got him in the back. Oh my God. We household through not just what they all know about each other. At least everybody, buddy. No, that's good. Everybody is, otherwise it'd be too much pressure. The fucking, the wife just brought

Speaker 8:          01:55:43       the kid home after he fucked the cousin because it's like, all right. He was fucking the straight when they fucked her cousin once she had the kid and she goes, you went back with my cousin. She just walked the kid to his house one day. She goes, I don't want this fucking kid. This is your problem. And she's never seen the kid say, oh my God, my uncle's got them in the back like Boris. Oh my God, I'm whipping him. His shit he's got cover was that, it's so crazy. It's fucking career. Three households. I have a hard time with my daughter and my wife. Never mind three fucking households. Do you see a guy like that? Does that just cause to for a distraction or is he just retarded? He's retarded.

Speaker 8:          01:56:26       He's retired now. He's banging a new one that's like funny. And how old is he? 78 he's got a 40 year old, a 40 year old man. He hooks up, went on Thursdays, and it takes it to the fish market. You go to Orlando, real weird place. Tell your girl, well, he takes it down. There's a fish market. So you saw the natural fish and shit. Right? And he fucks the shit out of and he brings home, it gives us some lung cancer. It gets a little heavy duty, cancer day. Any rocks her world would. So the whole family's concerned because they know and he punches the ticket. He's going to leave all his money to her. Ah. So everybody's pissed. Don't make with like, we don't know what goes on Thursdays. I do, but get your clock swigs isn't that funny that people worry about that? They're worried he'd like something more than them when it comes to the money. Where's the money coming? You know, man, it's one of the ugliest, I just got a call from a school teacher and he goes, I'm sorry I haven't gotten back to you. He goes, I've just had the hardest to once in my fucking life. My mom died. What a fucking nightmare. What a fucking nightmare death is. And then there were big because nobody gives a fuck. And also it's like prince. Prince dies. No will. $2 billion. Six motherfucking savages.

Speaker 4:          01:57:42       He had $2 billion. What? He had 250 million. Fuck. He really had no, well I've heard that a lot of things. Talking about how, how an investor involved in copyright. He was with his own music, which is especially why I changed his name and to think he would not think to have a will. It seems really strange. Some people who think it's bad luck. Yeah. Prince was crazy. Just crazy. Like you think that that would be odd for him to not have a will? I don't know. I don't, I don't think it would be that odd. He was so odd anyway, being that invested in your money cause that's what he was worried about with knowing all this thing. That's the last, I don't know. Maybe it doesn't care valuable. Maybe didn't want to be valuable when he was dead to family members and shit. Maybe he did want to like have that. He's like, who cares what happens to my money when I'm dead? The problem is the government gets a big chunk of it. If you don't have it written off, if you don't have a given off to, uh, various family members, I, the government gets up fat piece, but don't they still get a piece? They definitely get a piece. They get a piece. Not only do they get a piece, they get a piece from money that you've already been taxed on. Like say

Speaker 1:          01:58:42       of Joe, he makes $1 million, right? And Joey is $1 million in the bank and he leaves it all to you. Joey didn't make $1 million to get $1 million. He had to make way more than a million dollars. So he probably had to make closer to two because when you get over $250,000, tax percentage is like 40 something percent. And then sales tax and all the other taxes that you have to take, any consideration, state tax, all this different stuff, right? Property tax, I think about all the taxes you pay to save up a million bucks get, it's a lot of money. So if he leaves out of that million bucks to you, you don't get the million dollars, you have to be tax on that million dollars. So you have to be taxed on money. He's already been taxed on. It's not like he's, unless he gives you a gold coins. But even if he gives you gold coins, you Oh, the value of those gold coins in tax, you owe a percentage in tax.

Speaker 1:          01:59:30       So let's say if I to sit rows, I have a safe and every day I put a gold coin in there. I put money in the bank. You got a half a mil in the bank or they with thousands thousand savings. But I probably got like 2 million back thing coins and nobody knows what I leaving cause Joe Rogan to pay taxes on that. Yes, I would legit even if nobody would. Well, if otherwise it would, it wouldn't be mine unless you'd written it off to me. Right. So once you write it off to me, then it becomes mine. So if it becomes mine, that's some money that someone just gave me. I got to pay tax on it. Uncle Sam is just a robber just to like, oh, what'd you get a gift, Joey? You get a gift from me. That's nice. That's nice. How come I didn't get a gift? Where's my fucking gift? But what if I want my fuck? What the fuck?

Speaker 1:          02:00:17       What have Uncle Sam don't know about that 2 million? Would you rat? Well, you have to. You have to figure out a way that you have that 2 million. See if someone gives it to you. What does this gift tax. Okay. How's that work? The following gifts are considered to be taxable gifts when they exceed an annual gift exclusion amount of $14,000 taxable gifts count as part five point $3 million in 2014 you're allowed to give away during your lifetime before you must pay the gift tax. Why hold the fuck on gifts subjects to the d? So if I give you something and it is expensive, you have to pay a gift tax. It's over a certain amount of money. That's disgusting. Thousand Dollars. That's disgusting. It really is. It's really sad. That's just sad. It's sad that we live in this fucking country that thinks it's okay to steal money like that from people.

Speaker 1:          02:01:14       Like say if you don't have anything and you know you don't make a lot of money and a guy gives you $20,000 you have to give the government a piece of that $20,000 fuck them. Fuck them. I mean fuck that. That's bullshit. What about when you like when I first moved here, it was my first like real adult job and I figured out I was working in 30% of the time for the government. They take 30% yeah, directly out of and it just, it blew my mind. And then, and then like I don't know what's going on with trump, but like in the last election, I think Mitt Romney finally came out until he paid like something like 17% which is not like they, it's an, it's, it's so sad. It's, it frustrates people when like the rich people can have all those deductions and pay 17% oh yeah, we're paying 30 well there's tax shelters and then there's also storing money overseas.

Speaker 1:          02:02:03       That's where thing gets things gear real weird. Cause there's a lot of super fucking uber rich people that have a fuck load of money stored overseas. And by doing that and by these oh, these overseas tax shelters, they can fucking hide a lot of money. You know who's got that going on? I remember that dude who had those late night commercials, the weight loss secrets. They don't want you to know about Kevin Trudeau. Remember that Kevin Trudeau guy? Yeah. That guy made a fucking grip of money ripping people off and vanished and uh, he went to jail, he went to jail. But the money vanished. Like he just like, there's a lot like he's claiming he doesn't know where any of it is. And so then they'll lock them up. They're going to lock them up for like 10 years. But then once he gets out, that guy's going to get in the fucking raft.

Speaker 1:          02:02:47       It's going to peddle out to the middle of the ocean to get picked up by a yacht and swept off to Costa Rica or wherever the fuck he's got that money hidden like these, a lot of these reg really rich dudes, they figure out a way to preserve as much of that money as possible. That's why they kind of like Bernie Sanders comes along and they fucking freak out. He was shot him up, shut him up the fuck is he saying he wants more people to pay how much and then there's like there's rates while he was in favor of like say if you make a certain amount of year, like if you make more than $15 million a year, let's just make up a number then every dollar over that they could tax you buy like some stupid amount wasn't only 90% percent. Yeah. Yeah. And he said he didn't think that was too much.

Speaker 1:          02:03:34       The idea is like you shouldn't be winning the game that that much like if the game is about money and the idea is like well we should probably be control how much money people make. Cause it shouldn't be just about money, should be about productivity, how much you contribute. It shouldn't be that you figure out how to move numbers around and some accounts. And because of that you've made $3 billion. Like what have you done? What have you actually contributed to society? You figured out some weird little loopholes and little sneaky ways you can move ones and Zeros around on servers. And because of that you've made $1 billion. Like so his idea is that that shouldn't be possible. And that after, you know, it's not like you can't be rich, but everything after like $15 million a year, you got to fucking just give it all back.

Speaker 1:          02:04:19       But that people are not going to work that hard. They're going to get to that $15 million a year mark and they got a slow it down, a backing off, just go on vacation. Yeah. And they're every, well it slows productivity cause those crazy fucks is dark as it is. Like they have to be washed. She's just gotta be some regulation because greedy fucking people get greedy. But if you don't have their, their ability to push it to the limit, if they don't have that ability, we'll have a lot less things that are new, a lot less innovation does be a lot less. Um, the companies like huge companies like apple and companies where you buy like awesome shit, it's going to be a lot less of them. They just, people are not going to push that hard cause they did not going to get the benefits that you like.

Speaker 1:          02:05:01       You get crazy benefits when you're some Elon musk character. You know when you've got billions and billions of dollars. He's a crazy benefit to that. Not just a benefit in terms of like being a guy who's like an innovator and someone who makes cool shit. But there's also benefits financially. Like the guy lives in a castle, right? He can do whatever the fuck he wants. He flies around in private jets. If you're limiting people and living in there, the amount of money they can make that drastically, you're going to lose a lot of those people. It's not a good argument for a

Speaker 8:          02:05:34       going against

Speaker 1:          02:05:36       sort of organizing wealth to the point where wealth distribution, but it's a, it's the reality of human nature.

Speaker 8:          02:05:43       You know, people, people aren't gonna work that hard if they can't make a grip of money they want to make. But again, I put a box of $2 million and I leave with you. I think at the fucking wake. My wife cause you to my and then I have to pay. Would you have to, why? Because you go to jail. How would you, how would they find that? They're going to find out because I have $2 million all of a sudden. No they're not. What do I do with the money? Just keep it in a bag. No, but you know, you, you money has like,

Speaker 1:          02:06:16       like they could find out, but if they see is, here's the thing, if you, if they found out you're going to jail, you'd have to trust the person. If you have $2 million, listen, if you have $2 million and you go to jail, you would give that $2 million back to get out of jail.

Speaker 8:          02:06:31       You wouldn't know somebody who died and left a million cash. It was illegal type shady character in their hands. The money went to three different places and now the sisters got it and she never paid taxes. She just came from Cuba. She is spending a little bit here and there. If I gave you $2 million, the first thing you'd do is go to the Lee. Lee's got a restaurant on Ventura Boulevard. Angelina's I don't know what he grosses out of that. When you go to the lead and you go, I'm going to give you a hundred grand a year, you're going to pay me 60 I'm not going to show up to work. You're going to pay me 60 grand a year and get my money back and I'll pay taxes on that stupid amount. I didn't give him nobody a half a million dollars that you left me. That's an interesting way to do it. To have like a no workshop you to pay somebody. You keep 40 why can't do it? It's illegal. 40 grand. Shut your fucking mouth til the day I die. So the day I died, you got an extra 40 off me just for doing the paperwork this month. Well that would work if you could do it this way to do it. Somebody leaves me 2 million fucking dollars. That's not in the television industry. This guy sold coke or whatever. Here's the problem. You're saying

Speaker 5:          02:07:35       Dick, that person I saying Dick Dog, that person has to figure out a way to justify getting that money like that. Where do you get that hundred thousand dollars where'd that go? Nobody knows. Now listen, there's tons of people that have done shit. You just said it you so listen. You work hard for your money. You're going to send money to some fucking Bahamian. Back with two fucking guys were weapon is holding your money. Good fucking luck. Nobody sends over 50 mil unless they got 50 mil hidden over here. I wouldn't, I wouldn't. You see what happened to Johnny Depp in that movie there with the coke? When he went back down in the Panamanian government took his fucking money. It took $250 million from a little more blow. That happens all the time. That happens all the fucking time. They'll switch back accounts. You trust somebody with your fucking $10 million over that. Really for me to put $10 million, 12 hours from me, I can have 10 million. That was close by too. That's gotta be so I know. Thousand you know if, if when they watched narcos, those fucking Panamanians whenever they were, they making so much money. They were burying that Colombians burying it looked like it was seeds. Yeah, just plant the money tree. They had to figure out where to put it. What are they saying? He spent 2,500 a month on rubber bands. Four or something crazy. You know how many millions of dollars? 20 how much money? 500 is what I saw on rubber bands at one time. He broke $1 million just to stay warm.

Speaker 5:          02:09:04       Jesus cried. It was cold at night. He just put money on the thing limit just to stay warm. I wonder what keeps a guy like that? Here's a perfect example. I mean not it's obviously drug dealing and not capitalism, but what keeps a guy pushing when he's making that much money? What keeps the guy from Virgin American look, keeps an American, will keeps trump building and making millions of things. What is it? Power, right? It's gotta be three of the seven. Yeah. You were speaking about addiction to drama earlier. It seems like. What would be the same thing? Get Your Dick sucked by that. Listen, that rats ate $1 billion of Pablo Escobar's profits each year.

Speaker 5:          02:09:46       He was earning so much a year. We would write off 10% of the money because rats would eat it in storage or be damaged by water or lost. Holy Shit. Cartel spent 25 yeah, and rubber bands to hold the money together. Oh my God. This is a crazy stats, but the thing about Escobar's, he made more money than you could ever possibly spend and yet he kept working. He kept wanting that money to come in. He kept working and from the little I've seen people loved him there. Yeah. Cause he would build soccer stadiums and do all of them. I think that's part of the reason why people get annoyed with trump or whoever you want to say here because it doesn't seem like they're doing anything. Well it's also that thing when you're selling drugs you get locked up in a business like Escobar was we had so much power and so much drugs he was selling. You don't want to give that power to somebody else. So once you've got that whole thing down and you're making all that

Speaker 1:          02:10:33       money like do you, you must be incredibly reluctant to give that up. I mean think about how long it took him to to put together the network to make the kind of money that he was making towards the end. Very reluctant to just hand that over to somebody else because the business is always going to be there that the demand is always going to be there, the supplies it was going to be there, like who's making these transactions? You just have to give it to somebody else. And then plus you'd open yourself up to all these other fucking drug dealers becoming just as crazy as you were when you're coked up and nuts. He, I read it.

Speaker 8:          02:11:06       One of his books, I read one of the books by a Colombian journalists, like I just don't read any off of. This guy was referred to me like this guy really worked in the transit. He was an amazing eye. He couldn't read any CEO fucking 500 company and how it's them with a third grade education. What did he have? He knew he knew what he had. He knew the price. He knew how to buy people off and he knew how to speak like he was a fucking Yanno like have you looked at them in the street? And I go, that guy makes 6 million and out where you'd go, Joey. Look, it was a belt buckle was belt buckle was got. I got a belt buckle is big, but the guy made so much money. I knew a guy that was making 6 million every six weeks, 6 million every six weeks because I know him personally.

Speaker 8:          02:11:54       No, but I knew him on site. I knew what he did. Was He doing? He was, what do you think he was doing? He wasn't even looking at the code. You understand me? I wasn't even looking at, it was coming from Columbia with Landon, Denver and from then he would ship it to no walkie Hawaii and all the states around it. Cause that what? He shipped that drought, white people with a family put in the trunk of a car and we're going scan me and why? Why are you going skiing? And you got 25 fucking pounds. My the back of your truck. You don't even see it.

Speaker 1:          02:12:29       You can just say you go somewhere, you meet somebody handed off.

Speaker 8:          02:12:32       You don't even have him go home. Just give him the car like a movie. It's like a giant time. I'll just give him the car.

Speaker 1:          02:12:40       You see all this giant dip shit that's going on in the news. Johnny Depp is girl. Doug Stan Hope wrote an article. It's scary. Yeah. Well it's one of two things. Either giant deb really beat up his girlfriend or his girlfriend is lying and saying that giant depth beat him up and Stan hope and his girlfriend saw it the whole time. That Stan hopes version of it. I trust Dan up. I trust him very well. I trust Dan hope, but as much as anybody I know. So if he says that, that she was manipulating him and that she was going to, she had said and he had was worried that she was going to do this. Yeah. Johnny Depp was being blackmailed by amber heard. Here's how I know guest column, Doug's Dan hope the rap bunch of people got upset at me for tweeting that it's cause it's, you're not supposed to take a side. Uh, and if you do take aside, do you have to take the side because a woman's

Speaker 5:          02:13:32       should could potentially be actually getting abused. Did he get arrested? I don't think so. The cops came and I think they found no evidence of what happens when the cops come and there's an argument now. Yeah, they take you away. It's not good. Yeah. They take the man away. No. I'm also wasn't there. He split the scene. Did he? Yeah, he fled the scene. But if there was a problem they'll come and got it. So with the pictures, if there was pictures and shit's broken now because of old Jay, you have to, especially in La. Yeah, it's specially in la, but it's weird how many people like automatically assumed that he was beating her up. It's um, why is it that someone wants to pick a side? Is it like to show that you're a good person and you side with the woman always. Is that what it is?

Speaker 5:          02:14:22       Like what's going on? Like why, why do people pretend that some people aren't manipulative at some? Some people are manipulative and we know that, right? We know some people are going to be live. We know some people lie and we know some people set people up. We know some people, black male, we know that's real, but why? How come when it's a girl we all of a sudden go away. I can't think that way, man. I can't believe you're supporting a wife beater. Like, what do you, she knew that she had a scar. She had a scar over her eyes. She got a restraining order. I just can't figure out why they didn't arrest him. Yeah, maybe he's got recordings or something, maybe know something, but he definitely has a bunch of witnesses saying that. Uh, Johnny Depp was worried about it before it ever happened.

Speaker 5:          02:15:02       First of all, Joe Rogan, they live in a creepy, creepy. How so? They don't live in a real life. Joe Rogan, I love Johnny Depp. He's done some great movies, but any of those actors at that level, you just had a, you just said, uh, you were talking about, I just saw clip. Well, you told me personally about you went to Naomi Campbell was party. How is that different from your fucking birthday body weight? First of all, I know you're 20 years. I don't have birthday parties. Birthday parties. Okay. That's number one. Gives you the right, you're looking at inviting like Thursday night at seven cafe landwatch right. You know, bring a gift. We're going to have dinner. Listen, I wouldn't go to your fucking birthday party if you're born with fire crackers out of your ass. Cause that's not me. That's not the world I'm from. Once you 15 and you get roller skates, birthdays are over, you get a kiss and a blow job from your wife.

Speaker 5:          02:15:54       I don't even give a fuck about a cake anymore. I do on the show. Went to a birthday party. Okay. When you live in that realm, we started him thinking, what the fuck and Jayda Pinkett and that black dude, what's his name, will smith if they lived in Philadelphia with that son of this, pick that motherfucker. You've ever seen the pilot of empire? No. You didn't. No. Pilot of empire. It has something very interesting that nobody caught in this country. Nobody said done the pilot of empire, the Black Dude, uh, uh, turnstiles lonely with a pimp, whatever. This is seen in that with a young kid that's gay. Comes out with lady

Speaker 8:          02:16:29       shoes. Huh? And he's writing a lyric to a rap song like, yeah, the, he sees the kid, he picks him up and he puts them in that garbage can.

Speaker 8:          02:16:41       Did you know that? No, I didn't know that. He runs in and they're like, what'd you do when he goes, fuck that motherfucker. I ain't gonna have no faggots labored in my fucking house and all this shit. When I came from Cuba, the first family I haven't counted before the deal, Lorenzo's was a black family. They didn't say the word nigger in the house. This is the 70s and you couldn't even talk about a gay relative. That's why I always knew that gay guys in the NFL and the NBA, that shit ain't gonna work though. That's just never going to work. It's like a hidden thing. But remember when they first introduced the gay basketball player in the NBA, people were jumping up for joy and not those brothers. Those brothers were on the phone with the general manager going to listen. This shit's deep rooted.

Speaker 8:          02:17:22       I don't want no game. I was looking at my thing. I don't care if he's black or not. A lot of people can't say that in public. They would be, people can't talk. When we really liked anymore, people just say shit just to fucking sad. We don't come from that fake worlds, man. We haven't been sucked into that Hollywood world. We won't allow it. We won't allow it. We just were having a Hollywood party. What happened? I don't leave to go to premieres. I don't know. I see people kissing cheeks twice cause I need to be there. So they come from a different world. Joe Rogan, what they see as reality and fucking what's going on. It's not really going on because they've sucked up. How many times you've been on the set and what you're looking at is dog shit and they laughing and giggling.

Speaker 8:          02:18:12       Laughing, fake laughing. That's not the world I came from. The producer. Fake laugh is that's a real thing. We tell the, I heard that they have to keep you up. Build you up. It's on the 30th take. That was hilarious. No ones. I know what? How about I come to your house and tell you the same jokes? Same joke word for word. You're going to be giggling. Nugget know don't, don't do this to me. Something that's too much. So you got to assume these people are living in this fucking world. That God, she was on the phone, a friend and she calls her friends at dot nine one one and all this shit. You know who the fuck knows joe? We right there. We don't know. He don't have a prenup. 60% he's going to lose. Why do you get yourself in these predicaments? You fucking asshole picks up stabbing a bitch and dropping off in the one seven Johnny Depp have a prenup. I supposedly doesn't. California is a 60% state. I don't, wait a minute, please tell me giant deb has a prenup. Then you know he's on drugs. If he didn't, didn't have. We'll find out here. If he didn't have a Prenup, he was on drugs. Has there been anything before like I've never heard of Johnny Depp headed girl or no, no. His ex wife said it's preposterous. It's not an Om. Doug Stanhope so it's not, I'm Doug Stan.

Speaker 4:          02:19:28       It was actually good friends with them. He says the guys are like, the last thing we would do is hit. Somebody just doesn't have it in them. It's not that guy. It's not like an aggressive guy. Well, at the other hand, something else happened. His mother died a week before. Now let's talk about a death. A death takes a while to sink in, but the first 25 days, my friend, you'll know. Well, Stan hope talked about it in the actual interview. Oh my God. Pair did not have 15 months. So heard benefits in California law, which guarantees her a minimum of one half of however much they're combined worth increased during their 15 months together. Huh? Forbes listed death as a 12th richest act or 2015 and net worth of $400 million. We'll see pirates of the Caribbean, six seven eight nine oh my God. During his badge to her.

Speaker 4:          02:20:23       Oh God. Go back to her during, he's managed to her depth. God, an estimated 61 million to appear in the $170 million. Alice through the looking glass and 40 million to star and black mass where he won raves playing Boston gangster, Whitey Bolger. Holy fucking shit. Oh my God. You dumb motherfucker. What are you do when you walk to the bank with a $40 million check? They don't even put you in the regular wine with Stan hope so you don't go to a bank. It's all done wireless. But when Stan hope was talking to him, he was saying that his mother, like obviously it troubled him badly when he died, but that this was as bad as that. This was like looming over him. He knew that he was going to get blackmailed. He knew that, uh, she was going after him. She had some demands and then hit unless he met him.

Speaker 4:          02:21:11       She said she was going to go to the, the press. He look man, he's an older dude. He's like 52. She's young and hot and obviously if it's, if doug and Johnny Depp or telling the truth, she's been at plf live and some people are really good actress, man. They're really good at pretending they love you. And when you're a guy who's like a celebrity, to the extent of Johnny Depp, he hasn't been not famous for more than 30 years. So through all that time he's had like weird interactions with people where he's not exactly sure where they're coming from. It's never balanced, you know, it's always, he's Johnny Depp at the end of the day, he's johnny deaf. I'm saying it's a different head pro, but the fact that he was willing to marry her and not sign a prenup is hilarious. That's hilarious. Called ether the ether Posey. No little living in the ether. The ether gel pussy like that non song. Can you imagine if I came to you every day and told you really? In fact there's that and then there's a pussy. You're that Leora hace shifts. You've seen how hot she, oh, she's beautiful. She's stunning. That's the ether. That's the really thorough, it's ethan, both of them. It's ether. It's the whole borough. You live in this fucking bubble. You

Speaker 1:          02:22:26       know. Everybody wants to come to la. That that to be a star. There's so much that comes with that bubble. She should have just taken a divorce. Why should have to slap around to San, I want to do this anymore. That's all she says. And she's making millions right. Was only 15 months like so do you think there's like a lot of hot girls, especially in this town who their entire plan is just to land a rich guy, marry him for a year and then just leave him? No, but let me tell you something. If that girl was smart and she looked at her attractiveness as a like a career and marrying rich dudes. Yeah, there's like a lot of value and it being broken up with Johnny Depp. Like if she breaks up with him and she makes like fucking look if he's worth that much money, she's getting 10 million, right?

Speaker 1:          02:23:11       She's getting 10 million at least, right? Yeah. Right. Okay. So she gets a 10 million, she relaxes and other rich dudes come in and try to scoop her up. Cause it's Johnny Depp's, former ex wife or current ex wife. You have to have a lot of those. Like they, they go from celebrity, the celebrity, if she wanted me to play and Kevin, he went through a nasty bags. If you want to get dark, you just go to the next is to go to the next Mick Jagger's wife. Just married fucking somebody who's got tons of cash and I said, what's his name? I don't know who did, who did Jerry Hall just married like she's 61 or something or 57 she's a Rupert Murdoch. Wait a minute. Jerry Hall reggae. Rupert. I thought I'm Rupert Murdoch. Kinda hot little Chinese boy last week when you would hold on a second. Scroll up and it's 59 beautiful family.

Speaker 1:          02:24:03       Jerry Hall, 59 posts photo with her and a new husband Rupert Murdoch. 85 surrounded by the children on their wedding day. Please expand that picture. Much larger. What kind of dark prostitution are we looking at here? This is dark. This is like sorcery. This is so strange when she can't even possibly pretend that he's attractive. That's like our dad man. She was married to Mick Jagger and he told her the wedding was Nolan boy cause they got married on an island. Shock. Johnny Louie C for a guy like Rupert Murdoch. That's a prize. He look, he's got a bunch of Chinese kids. Kids are like half Chinese. That's the ex wife. That's the last one he jettisoned. She talked too much. He didn't bow hard enough. I still see your face when you bow. No one. Let's find out what happened. Why am I tmz and uh, Rupert Murdoch. But he said he had some hot wife before that Jerry Hall.

Speaker 1:          02:25:01       Good luck. But my point was that I really think that this lady, if she just divorced him, but I guess she wanted a lot of money. She might've been greedy. She might've been angry at him. You know, who knows? I think it'd be more than 10 because it was half of what they made in that year. And they said he got paid 40 and 60 so that's near 50 no, it's half of what he is his money increased by. Okay, so let's pull that up again so we get a look at it. I'm pretty sure that's what it says. I think it said half of what it like, say if he made $20 million one year and then $30 million with her, half of that 10 yeah. You don't get a half of the fourth amendment guarantees her a minimum of one half of however much they're combined.

Speaker 1:          02:25:43       Worth increased during their 15 months together. So she made $10 more that year and Johnny made 50 million more. Yeah, it's madness, man. I mean, she, uh, she got him. There's a lot I've met girls like that man there. Coyotes, they're strange. They, they stand outside your fence and they howl and they're, they're vicious man. And there's this girl's like that and there's guys like that, right? There's guys that are roofie a girl's drink and raper. There's guys that'll a rip a girl's bank account off. There's guys that are creepy fucks, right? Well, there's girls that are creepy fucks to does human beings. It's suck. And we have to be aware on both sides. There's human beings that do devious shit. And uh, just because a, it's a girl, it doesn't mean she's not going to do stuff like that. Believe me, my friend was killed by a girl.

Speaker 1:          02:26:29       It's Phil Hartman was shot and it's sleep by a woman. They, people are, people are dark. They do dark shit. Men and women. And the idea that you're going to go on one side or another, I retweet, tweeted that article. Not because I believe 100% that that's what happened. But because Doug's Tan helps my brother. So if Doug Stan hope put something like that out there, I help him promote that. I help other people read his work does, it's not an endorsement, but it's 100%. Um, I'm, I will trust doug stand hopes, opinion on things before I will take some actress ladies word on what happened. I would to trust at least Doug's opinion that Johnny was at least saying that he was going to get black male. But who knows. He might admit smacking her yesterday. Didn't want anybody to know. I was like, hm,

Speaker 8:          02:27:19       business. I ain't bothering nobody. I'm watching the baby. It's four 30 that day. About this week. No, I heard a knock on the door. I'd never opened my door knocking on my door. You want, if you don't call me, I don't know when the door, I just sit there once. I'm one of those motherfuckers, unless you call me coming over, I don't open the door for anybody. You can. And that's, I've been doing that for 30 years. Nothing but the baby. It was like daddy something. It's just a dorm like God dammit.

Speaker 2:          02:27:46       Okay.

Speaker 8:          02:27:47       I opened the door, three women at my door, two of them a cockeyed. I swear to God, I'm not even trying to be funny. Then from the Cert Church of Latter Day saints. Huh? Okay. How are you doing? I go, listen, I'm not into this stuff, but my wife is my wife, isn't it? The more minutes I just said that so I could get off the hook. I'm feeling the baby. If you want to come back in 30 minutes ago was I'm really thirsty. Can I get a glass of water or a water bottle? Yeah, man. That's how they get you in. That's a tactic. I close the fucking door. You know me? I don't give a fuck. Hold on one second. I close the door. My wife was

Speaker 5:          02:28:22       from Tennessee. She saves those fucking bottles and fills them up with water and takes him to yoga. I throw them away. What are we white trash? I throw these things away. What's that done? That done. My wife saves him and puts them in the freezer for headaches and shit. So I went to get one of those and there was no bottles, so I give her a glass of water. She takes off. Now I'm running against the clock. These three little more than bitches are going to come back. My wife walks in, I go, let me let me go outside and get it. You know they stole my pipe. When they asked me to get the water, they stole my pot pipe from the balcony. Nobody else was on that balcony, but water got comes on that balcony and he sees the pipe. I don't leave weed up there.

Speaker 5:          02:28:56       I'm not that stupid. I just leave the pipe with the cleaner, the pipe, the fucking, my wife was there and warner came. The lady who takes care of mercy, they didn't steal the fucking, the Mormon stole my pipe. Let me tell you something. I got in that car and a hundred those few little cockeyed bitches down all over. I couldn't find them. They never came back. They stole my pot pipe. Do you think they stole it because they were just stealing things or do you think they stole it because they didn't want you to be engaging in such horrible behavior? Smoking marijuana while you're taking care of your child? I wasn't smoking when I was taking care of the child. I just always leave it out there. It's always out. That's how I mean. I mean like you have one, you have a child but he's still smoking marijuana and like how dare you?

Speaker 5:          02:29:35       What are you doing with a pot pipe that we need to take this from him? Maybe they took it but they smoked half ain't cockeyed know that two bitches ain't cockeyed though. Much shit that holes in her feet and the shoes on. What religion? Since people knocking on doors, I'm Memorial Day. That's a guaranteed slam through the door to the face. Then you have another one that you kept like he kept coming back. I had a job with witness. I was stringing him along. I wanted to talk to you. Caught me at a bad time to come back in an hour and see him lurking in front of my house. I'd be dry, could even go home. I couldn't even go home. I had to, him was strung out for like four months though. Every time he'd come over, you know what I really want to talk to you?

Speaker 5:          02:30:15       Give me those pamphlets. I ball in number. So some people must be happy that they come, right? They must get, some people are like, oh, well I've been really curious about this. Please come on. Any revenue, invite anybody in, you know, in the hallways. One time a girl was selling cookies. It was pretty hot. [inaudible] I invited around. What happened? Nothing close the deal. Back then I was like 21 did you buy the cookies? I thanks. So thinking about cookies, I don't remember. I just remember her being hot. It's fucking ass. But y'all didn't smells a lot of cookies knocking on people's doors. Speaking about taxing or what about those religions that make you give like 10% church tithing on top of taxes? Tithing. Oh, thank God. We had a guy in fear factor, they want 1 million bucks. You don't really win 1 million bucks because the government takes a big chunk and most people they take the one time payment instead of like the 50 grand a year for the rest of your life, that kind of thing. Um, but this guy before he did the stunt, started talking in tongues. He's like standing on us like cliff side. It's like Sha la La la La La [inaudible].

Speaker 5:          02:31:21       They like, they talk in a made up nonsense language, so like repeats the same sounds over and over and over again. But this talking in tongues, he really believed it was like a religious experience and that God helped him win 1 million bucks. I was going through a box of vhs was about a month ago and I put one in and I caught the beginning of the fear factor, like one of the second season. And I watched like 15 minutes of it. And looking at it now and knowing you, I don't know how the fuck you did that. The show should have been, how long does it take to Joe Rogan? Fucks you up? Like how long? Remember when Tony Soprano, I used to beat people up like there's somebody would say something and he just draw bottle and go over and start kicking it. Right. He'd beat up Georgie like four times.

Speaker 5:          02:32:06       Hilarious. He knocked the xy out. That's what the episode should have been like half the time. Like in the mid sentence, you just started punching somebody, kicking them when they're on the phone. What do you mean you don't want to eat the fucking eggs? That's the next level of fear factor. Like go on there like with Chris liebing as the host and every time he like act up, they just beat the fuck out of here. Like America's ready for seat. Fear factor was I had everything else in it. 90% of the people were cool. I think 90% of the time. Yeah. Yeah, 90% it was some goof. He can tell you probably, and I know you would look at him and go, oh, the cameras on as a grown man, it's the closest I've ever been to a street fight or that one that that one guy in that persona.

Speaker 5:          02:32:49       And if that wasn't, if that wasn't there, if that was somewhere else, instead of like in front of cameras, I definitely want to strangle them 100% like it just the whole thing. It was like there was eight cameras around all these people around and I was like, I don't want to commit to hurting this guy, but he's a dangerous fuck. I'm like, that guy could totally sucker punch me. He just, he was so amped up and kept coming into my face, kept running towards me. I pushed him away, ran towards me again. I pushed him away and I was like, okay, this is on. I'm like, I'm not gonna. I'm not going to pete pushing this guy way. I'm not going to take a chance. It didn't doing something. It's like clamped onto them. I was thinking of key attended them or needing them in the face trying to, I was trying to think like, I was like legally the good team would be as much smarter move because I have his head.

Speaker 5:          02:33:35       I'm definitely sure I get snap them down. I know he's got no defense and if I hit him in the face it's probably going to be ugly. You know, need someone in the face. It's fucking devastating. It's terrible. It's terrible to do someone's face. I got kneed in the face. Ones broke my nose, my eyes got black and blue. I had a headache for three fucking days after one knee, one fucking knees straight on the nose, just right on the nose. That amped up that they want to fucking physically fight you. Like people show amped up. They want to actually throw their fucking limbs at you. Boy, everything's gotten so out the window and when you're that close screaming at each other, like in each of the guys getting

Speaker 8:          02:34:18       in your face, it's so close to like a catastrophic injury. Like anybody that's that nuts that's screaming at you inches from your face. Like all bets are off. Like we're on a, we're on safari rules here. Like this is a, we're in jungled territory. This is a very dangerous time. If it wasn't for a lot of people being around particularly like if that happens and you're alone manage, if you're alone in the woods with a guy who's screaming at you and getting in your face like that, like people die like that all the time. People have a knife there in that sort of a situation. People stab people out of fear. Just trying to be the one who doesn't get stabbed, you know, you think it's gonna it's eventually going to get ugly. Oof. I had a situation with Joe Rogan, I was so scared, but it made sense what people say that when sometimes it takes to get hit and the fee it goes away.

Speaker 8:          02:35:09       Like my ex wife got some guy with my ex with her boyfriend to jump me one time and they hit the dog with a two by four and I think, oh wow, that, that they hit a, his name was Hercules'. They hit him with a, with a two by four and when I ran downstairs, the guy hit me with a two by four but he didn't really break my ribs. I just felt something and I could still swinging and stuff and I was really scared and my heart was pumping. But after I got my hands on him and the pain went away, like I was a different fucking person. Like his buddy hit me from behind and he tripped and he started running once I took the first guy down and I was scared shitless and the one guy was way bigger than me, but I got so pissed off.

Speaker 8:          02:35:49       Which one ran the guy with the stick? The bigger guy or the littler? The little guy, he hit me with the stick and I don't know what I did. I didn't know about singles and doubles. I don't, nothing about that. I'm not going to want to know about it. I was just so hot that I tackled him and I kept punching and punching him, punching a bunch of, and then I got away and I started kicking him and I just started stepping on him. I started stepping on them dog. I didn't know what to do. He was making weird noises and I went inside the house and I called the bolder copper was off duty. Who was a cool guy and I was prepared to go to jail like I had no. I knew I had Nigga. I was still outside on the ground. Guy was on the ground.

Speaker 8:          02:36:28       I fucked him up. I stepped on his ankle. I fucked up his foot, you know all that dirty shit. I kicked him before I went to call. I kicked him like three times in the balls just to really keep him down. Like I fucking kicked him with everything I had because listen, you want to hit me? That's one thing. They hit the fucking dog. You ain't going to hit a dog in front of me. Not In your fucking worst situate, especially in my dog. You're not going to have my dog two by four. And the other guy took off, and I know, I forget the guy's name was durfee and he came and he was 400 pounds durfee big, those big fat cops or boulder cop never got out of his car. And I said, durfee, you don't call the cops. You know, I protected myself. I maybe went a little bit overboard, you know, and turfy goes, call the cops. This is beautiful. Let's just wrap them up and dropping the front of the hospital. And I was always a pussy. I was never scared that night. Like at all. I think once that, that fucking two by four hit me, whatever the fuck hit me in the side.

Speaker 1:          02:37:33       Well there's, the anticipation of violence is almost sometimes worse than the violence itself because the anticipation that fight is what everybody's terrified of. It's like what could happen? The unknown. But once it's happening, it's not the unknown anymore and it's the bright. What's, what's going on, what's going on right now? Like in, um, competing. Once a fight starts, you don't feel the same fear. Like the real fear is the way in [inaudible] before the fight, like the announcements, walking to the, to the ring, waiting in the locker room, all that. That's the real fear. When you're there and you're actually fighting, it's not a fear thing. It's just a, you're so zoned into the moment. You're so reactive. It's, I would imagine that's probably the same thing, but that it's just like the fear of a guy coming over and kicking your ass is way worse than actually being in the fight with the guys. Especially if you know how to handle yourself. It's like now it's, I actually control something. Something's going on here. I can react. I can move around with something that's actually going down. Guys get addicted to that too. Boy,

Speaker 8:          02:38:34       I'm very surprised. I'm not really, really violent. Like I'm really surprised. No, no, no, because they always blame shit on your childhood. They always attach things to your childhood and I grew up around one of the most violent people I haven't met in my life. That's why I know fear like I know what fear is to be scared of somebody really fucking great. There's a difference between getting smacked his Stepdad and his friends. The people we hung out with and I'm surprised I'm not more violent like I don't, I don't shoot animals.

Speaker 1:          02:39:07       Well, you're smart guy. You were well, you would never do that. You've always been an animal lover man,

Speaker 8:          02:39:12       but it's just weird that I didn't come out with that. Like I don't believe in a stop though. When did your violence stop because you were still smacking people? I don't know when, Nah, my violence stopped when I got beat up. That's when that violin mentality, when I realized that there's always somebody out that's going to fuck you up and now it's not like your mom. It's not a controlled beating. It's real. Somebody could, you don't know what makes somebody punched you three times in the head and stop.

Speaker 1:          02:39:41       Isn't that interesting how that is like the answer that everybody always has to how many pussies they're out there that talk so much shit. Like there's a lot of people running around the really need to get a fucking punch in the face and people go, that is a terrible way to think about that is awful way. But no, there's a humbling too that just like that lady who was like, thank you sir. When she got fucked up by that elk, you need to get, thank you sir. You, you really need that in your life. Like people need to get their fucking ass kicked man. They don't. So they just run around thinking there's no consequences to their actions. The living in his nerfed

Speaker 5:          02:40:14       environment, the guy like you, you see some dark shit going on and you know, you know there's consequences. You grew up with consequences, heavy, heavy going to the hospital believes that's a consequence. Unless you're always around drugs and drug dealers and drug people and people that are involved in illegal activity where they have to protect their freedom like drug dealers and being around drug dealers like they're always one step closer to violence than anybody else around them. They're always cause they are living a dirty life. They're living a life of complication and and worry. You always get to worry about someone turning you in. He always got to worry about someone getting arrested. Where'd you get these drugs from? Oh where does he live? And then boom, you got to worry about people showing up at your house. You got a stash stuff in weird spots.

Speaker 5:          02:40:59       You got to always be on edge. And once you add that drug to the mix, like once you're dealing coke. Okay. Like okay, take for example Pablo, Pablo, then snort cold. He didn't do drugs but I find the movie swung on a lot of weed. Right. Did you do any coke? No show. No. No. That's all. I think you're right. Once you, once you do coke as a dealer or heroin or prescription pills, that puts your judgment somewhere else. When you do coke and you'd do coke for three hours, the high become something else that you for. It becomes paranoid, right, and the more you do it, the paranoia, it's shuts the window. That euphoric state goes from three hours to two hours to one hour to two bumps, like towards the FMA. Two bumps. I was done. Paranoid was high on the way home.

Speaker 5:          02:41:48       If I was driving and I saw a cop car over there just watching speeders that cop cars stayed in my mind and grew like a weed. Why was he there? Why that makes your trigger finger a lot quicker? That makes so many things a lot quicker. Yeah. I used to call the cops on myself. That's not a junk, that's not a fucking joke. That's a joke on stage. Where I originated from was in 1986 I spent the weekend doing the best coconut world and I kept calling the cops, called the cops and they kept coming and going, what? There's a paragraph in the other room and the time they go, can we talk to you and said, listen, how many lines have you done? And I haven't stopped him. Like we suggest you put away the bag. Oh, that's so fun. The next Monday I had a walkthrough the police station, like when I have to a good 12 hours sleep.

Speaker 5:          02:42:37       And explained to them I wasn't doing blow was just the reaction to the orange juice. And they're like, listen, you gotta stop. You gotta stop doing powder. You would call him the cops on yourself. That God, this happens all the time or period asked me. So David tape when I was a volunteer fireman and aspirin? No, you didn't know about that? No. Okay. Your uncle joy. Okay. And, and snowmass village to be, you could go to a shitty gym or you go to the snow mass club where they have shaving cream and cute tips kitchen. So you know, Joe Angel in the snowmass club, but it was three bills a month in 1982 I couldn't afford Danny hundred a month. Oh my God. The snowmass club. Oh, the snowmass could even do what I spend in those days. The Aspen Club was what gray boy got blown up. That drug deals making 6 million every six weeks.

Speaker 5:          02:43:26       They blew them up at the Aspen Club. Jack, right by, uh, blew him up, boom up with a pipe bomb and then you know who his wife May die. Oh fuck. You know, he held down for six or seven hours. He bled out of his ass that year was the jeep that they put an extra plate under the jeep. He would always give somebody a 20 to start his car. This one night, he didn't get my money. He was 20 days from going on trial. They found inside of this house in garbage cans. Well, he would just go into a restaurant and say, hey joe, how are you? Joe? Do me a favor. He's on a thousand Tommy when it's over, wait a second. Wait on trades. $18. So he would just give them money and that way he would never pay when he would go there and just had a running account.

Speaker 5:          02:44:08       Just had so much cash coming in. That's actually pretty smart fabrics where he would do so when he got blown up, you know who married his wife? Who? James Caan, James Caan, Mary Gray, Bud's wife. All those single why he was that get money. When they get blown up, they fucking all getting remarried. You're right. That's why I'm thinking if she just kept her mouth shut and it took some cash, he'd probably give her many millions. Right? You would think so. But how many more millions do you think she'll get for lists and she'd have to imagine some Iranian dude. So person guy with the fucking Gold Bentley was still dog. They told me, listen, you don't want to pay the 300 you could be on a volunteer fireman. And I go, fuck the 300 I'm a fireman. So for six weeks they put me through a training program where you just like put out dumpsters and give them out of their mouth and CPR and you gotta run with a little bags.

Speaker 5:          02:44:58       I'm doing all this shit. Coked up to the gills. I'm selling coke. I'm going back every week and getting a pound of coke is selling it and to give me my hobby. I'm a volunteer fireman, but have you ever been in Aspen snowmass? Yes. I've been asked the only fucking fire, so the one's white people don't know how to do a fire in the fireplace. Debit, fire. They scoop it and they put in the garbage. Then there's a fire blow, so I would get coked up at night and they'd be outside of my house beeping behind pine with the bell. It's like, come on out, there's a fire. Come down. Fuck you. I wouldn't come out of the house. I get so paranoid and then asked me the next day. What happened to you last night, Dawg? I took a sleeping pill. I couldn't get up. This must have happened because every time I did show up it was always a dumpster.

Speaker 5:          02:45:39       Right there was on fire. What am I going to leave the house and fight for fucking dumpster. Eight white people with sticks and the helmets were radios over the fucking got a six third street. They get in the mouth, the mouth of the parrot, the shit, the fucking dumpster. Did he do any fires and you're like three fires, but they would just dumpster fires. So after a while I said, well, there's 80 years idiots with things, you know, make them believe that busy, forget to leave me at home. Call me for the big ones. That's so fine. There was never a big one, so they fucking fine with me. That's when they realized I was only in it for the membership pass. They said, well that spends a weird place because obviously there's a lot of router really wealthy people and they've called it home for a long time.

Speaker 5:          02:46:28       But then there was a lot of hippies and moved there in the 70s because they just wanted to get out of society and they somehow or another gravitated towards aspen. Like I don't understand how that happened. Well, what it was about Aspen, Colorado jails and number one and two in the country as far as capacity in the old days, 10 to 20 years ago, Boulder County jail was number two county jail in the country. They fed you that gave you clothes. That's why they vote democratic. They trim your toenails, they give you rolling paper. You know, in boulder you could still smoke it. Years ago they gave you rolling papers and sick tobacco. Real. No other prison did that. Everywhere else you got to pay for cigarettes and Bogan and Aspen. They don't even have a kitchen. Paula France used to cater. That's why fucking Bundy escape. Paula French used to cater and ask him if you're going to jail, you get catered dentists.

Speaker 5:          02:47:20       They don't have a jail. They have a county. They killer Ted Bundy. Escape from the aspirin jail. Yeah. Well you opened up a window and jumped down. Whoa. And he killed the girl in snowmass village. Man, that guy's scary. He is a scary motherfucker. He just escaped from the fucking ass in jail. Jumped out of a window. Wow. Well you got to drive. Then you get to drive for a little bit and we're in prison. Like you went to Wiki spaces and I would drive, you know, because I was the only one who went to driver's license. So they would let me drive to the places where people usually go on the road and see inmates picking up trash. Yeah, I would bring them lunch, but at the same time, those people, they know where they're going the next day. So he called Joe Rogan and go, Joe, what are you doing tomorrow?

Speaker 5:          02:48:02       Nothing. I'm going to be between a Laurel Canyon and Compton. Uh, cold water. Do me a favor by that sign that says save the apples, dumped the weed that and so that's what you do. So the invictus come pick it up and things and they give me the bag and I would drive with them. The weed would be in the trunk and the garbage. So I believe the garbage on the trucks. Then the Ebix come back. I would mark the bag that they throw the weeding and they would kick the weed out or heroin or the fucking speed and give me a cut while it's fucking amazing. That's how they bring jail. And he never got caught. You know what's crazy thinking about it now the gods are part of the action. They don't want to get caught. Yeah. They'd rather not deal with the stuff. They were extra income guy. They'd rather just relax. I get nervous bringing in an edible onto a plane. Shit edible on the planet. My middle fucking damn doctor. She joint disease and scared of the edibles. I'm playing the shit. What's up baby? That's it. Three hours. That's it. We did it all. What do we got? We got a July 8th you and me are

Speaker 4:          02:49:08       the car theater. The MGM. I was going to be fun. UFC 200 yeah. Yeah, UFC 200 that's going to be chaos. I think I'm going to go on Thursday for the fucking thing. I'm walking around. Yeah, for the expo. Yeah. Good idea at the nice people, but you should probably get a set, see if you can get a set at a the at mgm club at Brad Gareth's club Thursday night. Yeah, but you could do a show that there's an iphone to fucking set. You don't give a fuck. Oh, hang on. All right. That'd be through a seminar or some learning seminar. Yeah, probably put some salmon has got some great seminar. I think that's part of a package. Well, this is a giant, it's a giant week, you know of the UFC experience down there for UFC 200 so it's great. I went about five, four years ago.

Speaker 4:          02:49:48       The first year they did it, you took me and I walked around. It was pretty interesting. Great stuff. They usually have gotten grappling tournaments. I don't know if they haven't then this time I'm sure they are. They have a lot of Gnocchi, grappling tournaments to seminars, all kinds of shit. Joe [inaudible] for me is to countdown for UFC one 99 and you can watch the church of what's happening now on youtube and Vimeo and Vimeo and a, you can get it on itunes. It's a fucking hilarious.

Speaker 6:          02:50:56       Okay. Okay.
