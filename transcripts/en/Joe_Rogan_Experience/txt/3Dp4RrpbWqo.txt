Speaker 1:          00:00:02       Boom and live cheeto. Santina of gentlemen come u with the hot ones. Hello Sir. How are you going? I'm big daddy. Good brother. Just played a little bit of pool and lost a game and lost. Lost One. Ill illegitimately you one, one illegitimate. You mean lost? You lost one illegitimately yeah. Yeah. Scratching is not a good way to win or we are scratching the eight ball. These gentlemen. It is. It is the way to, when it happens, even to the baskets. It's a real way to win. I'm good you. While you can't, you must control the cue ball. I have no, I have no balance over any of that stuff whatsoever. I know there's a little red dots on there. Yeah. It means nothing to me. Those little red dots are the, they call that the measles cue ball in that cue ball they've developed for television so that you could wash the ball spin so you know what kind of English the guy puts on the ball has nothing to do with the person that shooting whatsoever.

Speaker 1:          00:00:52       It does. Yeah. It's the person that like for the, for the most, it's a very controversial ball. You really want to get into it. I do because it has a different reaction than a red circle cue ball or a red dot Q ball. Those are the preferred cue balls have a lot of players. Right, but the measles cue balls, it's just maybe the tiniest bit heavier or the surface is different or something. But it's still legal. People use it in tournaments. Yeah. Okay. But players got, some players got angry when they came up with it. They didn't like it. They like the old cue ball. That's how precise the reactions are. When we get to the very top level of pool players, let's kind of like golf balls, but people think almost don't mean anything to golfers. They do. I'm sure the field is so there's a lot of soft, softer golf balls.

Speaker 1:          00:01:37       Like a lot of people like Titlest makes predicting a provi once or probably one access harder, softer. He average Joe who's full of Shit, who's like, I like Pro v one it doesn't mean anything to him. Some guy that's like a 15 or 20 handicap. It means nothing. A guy that's like a scratch golfer. Like a like a pro pool player. It makes all the difference. Yeah. How it comes off the face, how it spins. There's a thing called a mud ball. If it's buried in mud it, it, it reacts differently the moment it comes off the face mud on it, it's even a little bit right? Yeah. That mean the tiniest bit that, wait, can you hear pros? Impressive bulk offers to as they played with a bunch of different weights of clubs. Yeah. It's like a pool player basically uses one cue and maybe one cue to break with and some players even break with their playing cue.

Speaker 1:          00:02:20       But you, you don't have like a bunch of different cues for a bunch of different shots usually. Well this cause the distances but you just get used to the feel of one cue. So when a player changes cues, like say if you go from a 18 ounce Q two at 21 ounce Q, there's a big difference in the way it hits the ball, drives through the ball different. You have to make the Q do more of the work. Right. Heavy with a heavy Q. Do you think it mentally changes the way you strike it? Totally, yeah. That's the Fox and people's heads. That's what's so impressive about golfers. They got all these different weights. Everything's different shape. It's different. There's a guy, I think his name is Bryce. Cindy Shambo, I think that's the golfer he used. All his clubs are cut to the same length, which is really rare. Nobody does that. Like almost every club set

Speaker 2:          00:03:00       you get is all different lengths clubs and he is this, people did it years and years ago, but he's like one of the only guys on tour that now cuts his clubs to the same length cause he mentally wants to have the same exact stance over the ball no matter the shot. It's pretty smart. It's, I mean it's a, it's a cool, interesting concept. A lot of golfers don't know how to adjust that much. I don't know Jack Shit about golf, but there's guys with weird strokes and pool. There's guys with weird technique in boxing and it still works. Yeah. There's people that do shit different. There's no way that, I don't think there's any right way in sports. Some of the ugliest shots in basketball tend to be some of the most fun to watch. And sometimes they're really good. Like sometimes like the classic Ray Allen basketball stroke is probably the most beautiful jumpshot, you know, compared to him and Jordan.

Speaker 2:          00:03:46       But there are guys that have terrible looking shots, but they're fucking phenomenal. It's just, it's just consistency and their inner balance over, you know, the, the timing that they have in the release that they have. That's to say that's gotta be the same thing in every sport pool for same shit for sure. In boxing too. Yeah. You know, in boxing it used to be thought that you pretty much, you know, if you went to a good trainer, they would teach you to keep your hands up. Those always the way to box. But then you get to a level of like a Tommy Hearns. You remember the way Tommy Hearns used to fight? He used to keep his left hand low. Really low. Yeah. Down to the side. And he would snap that left hand at you like a fucking let Colebra man is cracked motor city Cobra.

Speaker 2:          00:04:29       He would just pop that fucker right in your face. That's why they used to call them that because it was coming out of fucking nowhere. Hitman, Tommy Hearns. He was a bad motherfucker dude. And then he would hit you with that right hand and he had so much torque cause he was really wide. He was really long and wide for a welterweight man. You'd look at him in 147 pounds. I think he was probably like six two and just shred hatch act and just Korean 47 at six two is lightweight champ. You're see what he looked like when he fought sugar ray Leonard. Uh Huh. Oh my God. Yeah. And then he went up to one 60 fought Hagler and got k owed by Hagler and a crazy slug fest. You never saw that. Fine. Pull up Marvin Hagler versus Thomas Hearns. This might've been the great, I think it went two rounds, but it might've been the greatest two rounds in the history of the middle weight division because these two guys were super skilled.

Speaker 2:          00:05:16       I mean, Marvin Hagler was a brilliant technical boxer, can switch from south pod orthodox like fluidly like you, you didn't even notice a difference. He fought just as good from both sides and he knocked everybody out and had an iron chin and Tommy Hearns was mark and motherfuckers. He mark, Roberto Duran with one punch. It's blank face planted on fucking one punch, man. He's titty. Stung with one shot and let me let them see that first. Here's the buildup. The buildup is Tommy Hearns, [inaudible], Roberto Duran. Let's watch that first and then we're going to go back to Marvin Hagler versus Tommy Hearns. So you get a feel for what it was like to be able to switch up. Your stances is so crazy to me to be able to do that so fluidly that well, that's one of the brilliant things about Hagler. I mean he was just so good at that and he get in.

Speaker 2:          00:06:03       It's weird for a guy when you're used to, I remember the first time I fought a guy who was left handed. It was super confusing. Everything's coming from the wrong place. Everything was like reversed. You gotta get used to it, right? You don't see it as often, right? So if you don't see it as often, sometimes it's more effective. But some guys are really good. Again, southpaw, some guys have like a lightning right hand. And that was one of the speculations about Hagler and Hearns cause Hearns had this lightning right hand and Hagler oftentimes fought south pot. And that's the counter for south hall is a, is a straight right. Now, watch this though. This is just goes to show you how God look, how big he is.

Speaker 2:          00:06:41       Rude. She's look at this. Ooh, come on man. When Tommy Hearns Merck people, he's marked people and you've got to understand, man, he did this to Roberto Duran. That's fast in slow motion, dude, he was so fast, fast, even in fucking slow motion. He was so fast and he hits so hard, but now you've got to watch this and this is Hagler in his prime. He was 30 years old who was the undisputed mother fucking middleweight champion of the world and most people thought he's the best pound for pound fighter on earth and Tommy Hearns of course you just saw what he did to Roberto Duran and it was a lot of speculation, a lot of speculation coming into this fight and they just went at it from the beginning of the round. There was very little feeling. It was just constant pressure by Hagler right hooks, boom, boom, we this bro, they, they're going to war.

Speaker 2:          00:07:31       These are two of the best fucking middleweights ever and they're standing in front of each other, go wing to war and it doesn't feel like anybody's faced. It feels like there's, it feels like they're at the exact same energy level too. Oh Dude. Both of them are. They have the same output look fucking crazy fight Matt. And they were throwing full power shots from the moment the fight started and they right in front of each other. Man, if for Hearns this, this negates is gigantic reach advantage over almost everybody. Yeah. So Hearns decided to fight this way. He decided to stand right and look at him. The referee could barely separate herds, decided to stand right in front of Hagler and haggard decides to have right in front of her aunts and they just now Hearns is moving. See now this is what Hearns could have done from the beginning and made it interesting.

Speaker 2:          00:08:16       Sticking and moving. But by the time he decided to do that, he was already touched up and Marvin starts moving in for the kill that left hand to the body. Hagler was relentless in his cardio was fucking supreme. It was supreme. He always put pressure on people and you couldn't have hurt him. He only had one bullshit knocked down. His entire crew is a bullshit knocked down. He fly. I think it was one role, Dan and won role. Dan kind of like, it was more like a shove and maybe maybe they tripped or something like that. And the referee called it a knockdown. But I remember thinking God, cause Hagler had a weird thing that he was either born with or developed. He had giant muscles on the side of his head. Like he was temple worn with head gear. I'm not bullshitting. They had him and this was like a big thing in the world of sports back in the day like that.

Speaker 2:          00:09:08       He was literally almost born for this. That's how good Hagler was. Yeah. These motherfuckers are really, I mean it's relentless do their, they're towed up every time it's up there. Barely look looking for any distance between each other. And you got to realize, man, this is not how people usually fight. They don't throw full power shots and every shot, I mean they'd be tired within 15 seconds. These guys are just going at it. So I think this was like almost like a game of chicken. Like both of them knew there were never going to reach the 12th round. Right. So they said fuck it, let's just do this. And haggard just stood right in front of them, constantly blasted them. And you see at the end of the first round, Hearns is wilting. He just does not have the power or the speed or the movement.

Speaker 2:          00:09:45       See, he's all goofy. Yeah, he's sloppy. He's just exhausted. He is exhausted. But still the warrior in him is making him throw these fucking bombs, man. You got to realize like at the time, no one really knew what the fuck was going to happen in this fight. And then Hagler heard them. Yeah. There's a little stumble in one of one of hagglers incredible attributes. Besides his skill was his determination to win. Man, he was just Keizer for Roche's competitor, man. Just ferocious. And so if someone was willing to engage him in this kind of crazy fight, we're going to stand toe to toe and see who's the bigger man. Oh my God. Everyone's going to die.

Speaker 2:          00:10:24       That is going to take you to the end of the earth man to the end of the earth. I mean, haggler just looked like he just had, it's still so much left in the tank. Even at the end of the first round, like if he's not doing this for years, he's never had a shape. He never partied. He never did anything stupid. What did he didn't want any short? No, never got fat. No drugs, no alcohol, no nothing. No. And how about this? Retired after the sugar ray Leonard fight lost a controversial decisions. Sugary Lennar to, to this day, I think you won. And then, but it was a close fight, but and then just retired and became a fucking movie star in Italy. That's fucking wild. Love that guy. Yeah, but that's the way to do it. I'll kind of go out of the good prime and then just say good night.

Speaker 2:          00:11:02       Nobody else did it like him, man. Nobody else did it. Like, Ooh, that's where you heard him. Yup. Now he's just moving in for the kill. Move in for the kill. Now he's taking his time. See now it's just nice and relaxed. This is inevitable. Now Marvin is just moving in and decide and when he's going to uncork, when he's going to uncork moving in, blocking these shots, he knows it. Hearns is hurt and he starts teeing him up. Shanahan and Hearns is trying to move down. See now that's how I thought Hearns was going to fight. And Mo, most people thought Hearns is going to fight from the beginning. Like that just keep me down. Got moved from the outside, from the outside like that. I mean that's, that's classic Thomas Hearns but the warrior and him wanting to find out, you know, and want to find out who's the baddest motherfucker in town. Who is it? You know, you could fit you and you can feel him backing up. Kinda he, he knows what's kind of, it's like he knows what's coming.

Speaker 1:          00:11:54       He, he's getting in some good shots. Even then he's creating distance, but even still, it just doesn't feel like he's balanced. See that right there. Oh, he's hurt. Haggar standing right in front of him. He is touching him, but he's, he just doesn't have the pop anymore. You know what it's like when you're working out and at the end of the workout you're fucking exhausted and you could barely do one rep. That's what happens with your arms when you're fighting. It just, there's nothing left. There's nothing left. It's not like, you know, he's doing this on purpose. Right. He's, he doesn't have it. There's no gas in his arms, like his arms are completely flooded right now. Like all the blood in them and every, it's just they're not recovering. It's a horrible feeling to, he's swinging though. Look, he's swinging, but it's way slower than it was the first round.

Speaker 1:          00:12:37       Right. His snap was, snap was so much quicker in the first round and now he's, now he's not following through a little bit. Exactly. He's trying to conserve energy. He realizes he can't do this forever. He's exhausted God there, but they both look like they're fucking at that one. That little breaking point where it's about to be either. I'm telling you it Hagler even though he might, it might look like that because it is a fast pace. He could do this for years. He says they can do this. He just didn't get tired, man, and you couldn't hurt him. He was crazy. He fought a dude named John the beast. Mugabi and John the piece when Gabby was fucking terrifying people, man, he starts Terry Norris. He starts to bunch of dudes. He was a heavy puncher, heavy puncher and Hagler stood right in front of them and he got caught with one big upper cut and it didn't even budge.

Speaker 1:          00:13:23       Upper cuts that were like Merck and people didn't even, he didn't even flinch. So what round was it? Was it the third round of the third year? The third round? Here's the third round right here. It shows you how fucking tough Tommy Hearns was. I mean, those two rounds were just fucking knockout. Drag out. Relent. Yeah, just nonstop. But towards the end, you clearly see hagglers coming on. I mean, he looks good, he looks good and he's pacing himself. Now he's just, just moving forward, throwing shots. But yeah. Hearns is exhausted, man. It's fucking raw. Rough man. There it is. Boom, boom, boom. Or just trying to keep it and I was trying to keep him right. He's having a hard time breathing though, man. I mean, he's exhausted. See that big deep breath. What are you take that Big Sigh? It's almost like not, uh, somebody lost a mouthpiece, I think.

Speaker 1:          00:14:12       Is that what it was? He called his time. Yeah. I think that's what happened. I Dunno man. It's hard to tell. It's really blurry for this. Just going to say Amanda to two 40 p was weird back then. Hod look normal to us back then. Your eyes knew how to handle it, right? Well, you were just excited that you could see the fight. Right. You know, but this was, it was, I wonder if this, would it look like when it's on HBO had to vent a little bit on those TV. Do you know Hbo just canceled boxing? They don't have boxing anymore at all. At all. Just paper view. Now they don't even do pay per view. They're out of the boxing business. What? Yeah, and that crazy. So they'll never end and he's moving boom, right hand. Oh, it's does it. He knew it.

Speaker 3:          00:14:52       Damn. Dance it. Third round gone. I always miss this. I always think it's just hanging around for some reason. I think we've actually gone over this before, but third round. Yeah man. But I don't have boxing anymore. HBL got out of the boxing business. What do you think that's because of it's not earned enough money anymore. I don't know. It makes me sad though. They had some of the greatest boxing telecast of all time. I mean that was what you would do. You'd go if a big fight was on Bernard Hopkins was on, a lot of the times it was on HBO and it was on paper view. Then you knew it was going to be on HBO the following week. Right. So even if you couldn't afford the pay view, you could see the hang in there a week later. You knew who won, but you could watch the fight on HBO.

Speaker 3:          00:15:31       I remember going to watch, I remember watching fights in Hpo. I just remembered that let let HBO boxing being such like a emblematic thing for, you know what I mean? It's so recognizable. So like pay view on Hbo so them get out of the game is so strange. It's kind of like the revolution that's happening now. The last fight I went to with you at UFC, now their ESPN, what does it plus? ESPN plus. That's what it is. Private paid service. It's a subscription service, like a Netflix for sports, but it's, it's not just UFC fights. It's, it's a bunch of other stuff. Wow. All kinds of shit and stuff. They just won't show on ESPN at Aldo? No, they sometimes show you mean it's ESPN content? I guess so you could watch some fights that were on ESPN plus later they'll probably show him on ESPN.

Speaker 3:          00:16:19       Sort of like the same thing with Hbo pay per view, you know, but um, I think what HBO did with Paper View, it was brilliant where you would have the paper view, but then let people watch it for free. A week later you're just going to make more fans. Yeah. It's like you're not going to lose money on the paper view. I'm just going to make more fans. Well that's the whole idea of like a, that's why this, this, this is funny. I was going to talk to you about this anyway. I just moved and I cancel my directv. I'm done. I canceled them. I cut the wire and I'm just doing like a Hulu live TV, Internet shit. All the years of hearing people being like cutting the cord, cutting the cord. I'm like, I dunno man. I like it now. Fuck it. I love, I love what I'm doing now.

Speaker 3:          00:16:54       And I gotta Tell Ya, I can get all the shit that I want for cheaper than I had it before. And it's just way more convenient now. I used to be so tethered to being like, I'll never give up cable now. I'm like, fuck it. I don't want it anymore. I don't, I don't want it. This has been the best version. I'll always have a blockbuster card. Oh yeah. It'll never go away. It'll never Hollywood video, dude, I want to rent, man. If you put all your money in that he like, I'm telling you in 20 years this is going to amount to $15 million fucking Klan. Do you think people invested in Netflix when it was the DVD subscription service and that, you know what I mean, like early on and now they're still getting the, the revenue dividends of what Netflix is now. I wonder about that. Oh yeah. I'm sure you do. Like, that's gotta be the best money cause it was worth nothing back then. It was just another subscription video service and they had, there was a ton of them. I mean Red Fox. I did my first Netflix special in 2005. Oh my God, there's one left. Oh, I think I've

Speaker 1:          00:17:49       seen this. Oregon. Here you go. Yes. An Oregon, Oregon Bend, Oregon. That's so weird to last. Blockbuster. They went from 4,855 stores in 2008 to one store. 2018. That is the craziest demolition of a business I've ever heard. I wouldn't never heard of what other business in our lifetimes vanish like that. Like, uh, like I've come or like a storefront. I can't think of something that went away that quick little industry gone. It was John. It was a part of our weekend. Yeah. You go to plop buster. Huge. What do they got right? Ah, you hear anything about this? He'd look at the cover. I don't know that I never even heard of this one. Maybe it's good watching like obscure Dolph Lundgren movies that were made in Italy. Yeah. You would, you'd get to pick out shit that you're like, ah, this looks kind of dope.

Speaker 1:          00:18:40       We'll see. Back then. Gamble was fun. The name meant a lot like it was like this guy from dances with wolves. Oh, okay. Remember that guy? I can. Cool. You'll take a chance. Yeah, you will. You will. But I think that's happening again now with Netflix. I'll take a chance with shit now that I've, Shit I've never heard of because Netflix, you pop up all these different titles and you'll go, hmm, I'll try this fucking shit. I just started a new show I just tried to show and it's called dead to me with Christina Applegate. Christina Applegate. Yeah. It's okay. But like I try, I'll try it. I would have never think to, to, to, to watch this new show about these, you know, this, have you gone through all the staples at Netflix? Said, did you watch Ozarks yet? Done? Watched both seasons. Phenomenon. One of the best shows I've ever seen.

Speaker 1:          00:19:24       Did you watch unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt? Now I've seen a few episodes of it, but I fucking hilarious. She gets f people like it. But I love that show. It's so silly at the same kind of tone as 30 rock. Right. Does it say it's Tina again? Tina Fey's in it too. Oh she is. Sometimes she plays this wacky psychologist. It's out of her fucking mind. Likes to party. Yeah, she craves David. She has some of the best character development man. That's why 30 rock was so good. That show is funny, man. Kimmy Schmidt is funny. All right, I'll, I'll watch it. I'll try it. It just didn't seem like my show. It's absurd. You gotta give it a chance, right? It becomes really, it's really good. That's why it was like a some dull moments and one of those series, but they tightened it up quick. They, whatever problem they have with the writing, they've fixed it real quick.

Speaker 1:          00:20:08       Right. Well, I mean, first seasons are always hard, man. Well, I mean just writing is hard. Yeah. Writing for a Sitcom so hard. They hit ruts sometimes, you know? Yeah. Like sometimes I'll watch old Seinfeld when they pop on and some of the episodes are just fucking flawless there. Bangers like everything to be stories. Just as funny as a story and it's, sometimes you watch a few and you're like, Huh, yeah. They were like, they had a tough week tunic. You could tell they had a tough go. I remember that feeling with the news radio. I remember like episodes where just like, Ooh, well we did our best and that's all there was this one. Yeah, let me see what happens. They just don't, and then you'll have the next one. That's just insane. And a lot of times it's, it's like stand up in that

Speaker 2:          00:20:48       sense that a lot of times it's just like the subjects, like what are the subjects? Like what, what juicy topic do you have? Right. You know, what, uh, what, what is happening? And you just, yeah. You have to have something that engages people and sometimes it's sitcoms. Like fuck, you have to put out 20 something episodes a year, 2123 right. 23 short stories in a year.

Speaker 3:          00:21:14       I make them all tie in and have a nice little kind of a perfect through lifelong season. I know what nowadays a lot of people relying on on politics, which I think is, you know, it's becoming the new norm. Every time I see a billboard now it's a new political show. It's like a why it's seen act just got one. Jordan Klepper who was a daily show correspondent. He just got another one. Hassan Manoj as his, I mean there's like so many political shows now. They, they should all be writing letters thanking Trump. It's like Trump is really fueling all these new shows. If it weren't for him, it was like this new wave of political satire. I don't think I've had, I've seen this in comedy in my career. I've never seen this many shows about politics. Samantha Bee, I mean I just named five in a row. John Oliver show is right that last week tonight or whatever. That's essentially a political base show.

Speaker 2:          00:22:02       It's, it's slightly political, but it's very social too. Yeah, it is. It's, it's fucked up right in the week.

Speaker 3:          00:22:08       He's, I mean, listen, he's brilliant and some of these shows are probably great. I just think there's so much political comedy right now. It's just, it's not my shit.

Speaker 2:          00:22:14       No. Oliver's excellent. Yeah. He's a genius. The whole thing is what's, what's uncomfortable is that it's very, they're very little conversations taking place and a lot of people that are like really angry. Yeah. You know? Yeah. I was watching this guy, some, some representative, I don't even know his name, but he was a offering a hundred dollars to name the these girls that were in front of a, um, planned parenthood and um, he's like a grown man that these, they're girls, they're young Christian girl.

Speaker 3:          00:22:47       What do you mean name them as in like call them out games

Speaker 2:          00:22:50       so he could shame them publicly. Cool. Very smart. This guy's named name and, but he's an offering on this video. $100 like, but this is where people have gotten to where they think that that's okay. Yeah. Like these people you have like, do, I know you're there to support a woman's right to choose, but you have to understand that these people think that this is a place where they kill babies. Yeah. Right. This is what they think. Whether regardless of what you think, right. This is why they're there. They're not there because they're evil. Right. And I know that this would put unwanted pressure on a girls going there for an abortion. I get it. I get the whole thing. I get it from your side and I see where they're coming from too. And although I fully support a woman's right to choose you, you can't want to dox people that think they're saving babies or talking someone into having a child and that they think we'll

Speaker 1:          00:23:46       become the kind of relationship with that child and that mother become like their mother and them or like the ideal version of that. Sure. I mean that's what they're, they're not doing it because they're bad people. Right? Like there's some groups that do it just because they're pieces of shit like the Westboro Baptist church. Like they do things because they're bad people. Like all they want to do is go protest a soldier's funeral. I didn't want to cause a stir Megan Phelps who left them, right, that got out. Yes. Yeah. And now, dude, she met a guy on Twitter. It's a great store, right? It's an amazing human. Again. Well, she started talking to people and then investigating and real and dude, wow, I'm telling you, when you talked to her, she's like the nicest, most reasonable person. Right? To think that just 15 years ago, whatever it was, 10 years ago, she was a full on zealot.

Speaker 1:          00:24:32       It's weird. And her dad or uncle, grandfather, brother can't even get it right? Her grandfather is the Fred Phelps. He started the whole thing. He's the old dude, that old mean guy. But do you think it's fact you bill, you completely do you completely buy into the fact that she's a hundred years of it? So none of that's underneath while she's so honest and open about what she felt and why she felt it and why she was conflicted and why it didn't jive with what she was reading in the Bible. It didn't make sense to her. Right. And, and the way he was doing it, which she was realizing was not how Christians did it all over the world. Right. And that this, this, you know, this desire to constantly get attention in the news. Even at soldier's funerals, they would go to soldier's funerals and say that these soldiers are dying because gay people are getting married.

Speaker 1:          00:25:18       Like what they were saying, they deserve to die. They deserve to be dead. I mean that kind of, you know, but I'm telling you from that she's like the nicest person you'd ever want to meet. So she up in and regulation in her world, she realizes it was bullshit. She was tricked and you know, she's done a great job to free herself. But when you indoctrinate someone heavily into anything, and this is whether it's being a religious zealot or being a political salad, you indoctrinate someone when they're early in their, their, their youth, a formidable years. Very difficult for them to get out of it. It takes real work. But that's what I mean. I that's right. I guess I'm saying it sticks with you, right? Like my whole thing is there's things instilled in me from my youth, from where I grew up culturally and how I grew up that even though I'm more learned now, I still do understand those ways of thinking.

Speaker 1:          00:26:07       Right? So it is hard to break away from those things. Even though like when you just said the whole like w a woman's right to choose, right? Like I grew up in the Midwest, I grew up Catholic. This is how I am most of my family is for so in so many words against abortion, uh, but I don't think these things are mutually exclusive that you can be against abortion and against women's rights to choose. You can say that you don't like abortion, but also say I'm not going to control what you do with your body. It's kind of how I feel. I don't love the idea of abortion. I'm being honest. I just, I just don't love it. But I do think I'm not going to stand here and tell people what to do, but I should be able to still say

Speaker 3:          00:26:44       I don't like it. I don't think it's, I don't think it's a healthy thing to do. I don't really enjoy, I don't enjoy like the spreading of it being kind of this not a big deal thing. But I do think people can do whatever they fucking want to do. But I'm also allowed to go. Uh, I don't, I don't, I don't love the idea. Like I don't like it. Uh, just as an option. I just don't love it. I don't love it. Birth control is obviously the best method. Yeah, of course. And I think women should be more aware, but women, when they take birth control, man, they have to, I'm not not advocating for abortion as a method of birth control, but what I'm saying is when women take birth control pills, that shit fucks with them. The fuck's with their horse, not a good thing.

Speaker 3:          00:27:24       It's not good. And that, I know. And, and when they do it in, they also smoke. They can cause like real complications. It can, it's a lot. I mean there's a lot of women have really bad reactions to the pill changes your behavior, suicidal tendencies. I, I've heard a lot of like really bad stories. Now I'm also saying if we want to look at it from a different perspective, men should also take way more fucking responsibility then like, this is the other side is this, this argument tends to land on women a lot where it's like you don't tell me how to fucking, you don't tell a woman what to do with the body is like, okay, that's fine. I'm just saying how I don't like it. Also, I don't like guys nutting in women and fucking ghosting and not wanting to raise a child.

Speaker 3:          00:28:01       Right? So I think the other side of it is two parties here should be responsible. Men should take some fucking responsibility over, stop common inside of these fucking people. If you're not ready to have kids, I'm just being real. It's like either wear a condom or stop, stop, stop doing the thing that you know, makes children. So, you know, but again, this is this weird balance of, like I say, I come from this and I am not conservative, but like this real Catholic upbringing in the Midwest, you know, a good old Irish Catholic boy and the ideas that you hear as a kid all the time, you then grow and I now go, I think people should be able to do whatever they want to do. I'm not going to fucking control somebody. Mm. But I still have those little moments of, yeah. I just don't love it though, because it was something that was instilled in me as a youth, you know?

Speaker 3:          00:28:46       I mean, it's the same way for years. I felt guilty smoking pot because that was like, I've been smoking pot for 20 years, but I felt guilty for a long time cause my pa because drugs were so bad. Yeah. It was just like this over. And even today, sometimes I get high and I go, should I be getting high today? Do I have shit to do? Do I, am I, am I doing something wrong? No, no. I'm a grownup. I have all my shit together. I sure I'm allowed to get high. You're one of the few comedian friends that I know that has their shit together. You're grown up trying to just stay, stay having my shit together. You can just tear your shit. It's a hard task though, right? It's not easy. Especially for immature dip shits like us. Yeah, it's, we're not suppose this isn't supposed to have.

Speaker 3:          00:29:27       Nikki Glaser had a funny, she was on stage two and a bit and she just had said this phrase and I kept talking to her about it afterwards. She was like, we don't deserve this money. And I was like, what do you mean we don't fucking, and we just, and she's like, we just don't deserve this much money for being so immature. I was like, I guess that's Kinda true. Like we get to be clowny kids and still make a good living. Meanwhile, the guy, there's a guy who's an electrician at my house the other day, the shit he was telling me I couldn't fucking keep, I mean he sounded, he was speaking fucking another language and I had no, I was, he's like, all you have to have another ground. Cause the neutrals are different. How this is a two wire system back in 1946, you got to have three weeks. It's going on and on and on and on. I was like, you deserve more money. Like you're worth more money. I don't know why I have more money than you do. You do much more important shit.

Speaker 2:          00:30:13       It's all about with our guest with money, right? It's all about reach. You know what we were talking about earlier today about how much money Facebook and Google and all these people make from ads and how weird it is that like you look for something, then instantly those ads start popping up constantly. I am referencing Sam Harris's podcast again. I don't remember which one it was. It was fairly recently. He had a guest on and they talked about the, uh, the, the commodity of your data, right? The commodity of your searches and who's selling that and how they're, how they're profiting off of that and that this was like this commodity that nobody thought they were giving up. Then nobody thought there was anything to it. Right? Then these companies have found this loophole and have made billions of dollars through it by giving you free email, by giving you a free web browser, right? By giving you free searches, basically providing you with all the information in the world, right? What they want from you is want to know what you're interested in. That's all there'll be.

Speaker 3:          00:31:13       It's kind of like the real world example would be, uh, those trash companies that are like, you have a garage full of shit will come pick it up for free. Right? You don't know what's in that fucking garage. Some people are so old, they just throw shit out and they go, ah, I just get rid of it. Fuck it. You know, you know those storage wars shows, I guess they fake. Yeah, they do. They set them up. They load up the, the storage. We believe we found a world war two helmet. It's Elvis. His underwear was unbelievable. Yeah, they used to be real. Actually a few of them were very real and then they are very, then they got caught online. A bunch of people online, we're calling them out being like, this is bullshit. This is fake. I saw them setting it up like they got, they got caught.

Speaker 3:          00:31:51       But that's, they're going to do that. They should find magic in there and say this is fine. Should definitely shit storage wars where they go in there and they find a Leprechaun. The gap around makes you disappear. Yeah. One person disappears and they have a genie in a lamp and that's gotta be worth treating me like I'm really stupid. Have you ever watched the show ghost hunters? Do you know who it goes to? The ventures. Do you know this Guy Zach bag? Zak bagans. Do you know this guy? I do not know him personally. Oh Man. He makes me laugh so fucking hard because they've done like nine seasons now. I don't even know how many they found any ghosts come out, man. They have all this great technology now that you think that he believes in ghosts. Here's the best part. Okay. He is all in, right? I love anybody that's all in whatever they're doing to have to be. The host is all his adventure, but also now he's super self aware of their popularity and of his character caricature of himself. So he does it now on purpose. He took off his shirt when episode and he goes, you want to fucking fight me ghost? Let's fucking go to tow up. Throw a fucking punch. You're like, he's aware of his character that is this broey ghost fist fighter. This dude is Brennan shop and shop. That was on episode. Look at him.

Speaker 3:          00:33:11       He looks like he just got along from Shane Carwood sparring sessions. Yeah, he's still in the fight. He's still out of it. And so this is Zach is what? The beard? No, Zack is that dude right there, right? So Zack, where's Ed hardy type of shirts, right? He wears these loud, ridiculous, he patterned shirts, but he's, you got to see it do with more newer episode produce, do something from like 2009 to 18. You'll see what he looks like now. He's gotten way more fucking jacked. His hair, his hair is all flaked up. You know, he's gotten like more tan around and shit.

Speaker 3:          00:33:43       He's become, do you think this becomes super self aware that he believes in ghosts? No, I think he's just self aware of the product he's created really, that he understands now that's a challenge. I see the next whiskey ginger podcast, me and Zack, Zack, Zack, that's him right there, right? Like now he's like, Holly, what? He looks like a Hollywood guy. He's got these big black frame glass. Funny. Like you can't, he can't look any better. You know, you're not allowing him to have better style like that when Hollywood, you're so Chicago, it's fucking good as fucking Hollywood flog this spiky hair. He went Hollywood the fall. I'll tell you. That's the one thing I know I won't do is uh, like I'll never, I'll never get to a place when I'll be wearing clothes where I used to make fun of them like that.

Speaker 3:          00:34:24       Like I remember going, sky's wearing a fucking $900 tee shirt. I know now I can't do that. Like I can't, I can't get, I can't do that now cause I used to shit on it so much. Yeah. You have to mind by the rules of your own mall. If I, if I pushed it out there for so long, let's say he's got a nice hats him. Yeah, it looks good. I has had Jamie that your buddy and say the breath recent photo I could find. Jamie, do I zoom in real quick? I thought you were trying to say something. Is he handsome fellow? Cute Guy. Jamie, I want you to grow your facial hair just like that. You really think, do you really think he doesn't believe in ghosts? I think he does not believe in ghosts. I think he, I think he loves the paranormal, right?

Speaker 3:          00:35:02       He loves the idea of the paranormal. I think he loves the idea of forces that nature happening. Molecules, energies around us, all influencing the way we act. Sure. I don't think he believes in actual apparitions or what do they do? They call him s uh, uh, spirits on his EVP. We felt the spirit, they'll do this thing where they'll see a little orb or a light. This happens all the time with cameras when you switch to night vision and not these little deaf flecks of dusk kind of reflect light off the lenses. And he'll go, what's an orb? And they'll watch it float through the Lens. And he's a, he is obsessed about these orbs. They enter the orb

Speaker 1:          00:35:38       and he does this voiceover shit. He got lots of fucking jail. I get hired, I watch it. It's maybe one of my favorite things. What's the, Jamie, you're a photographer. What's the, um, scientific explanation for those little balls that show up in photographs? What is it?

Speaker 3:          00:35:51       Um, I don't have the knowledge for that, but it can be explained in lots of different ways. It's mostly, it probably like a light flare of some kind just because there's

Speaker 1:          00:36:01       just like in this dose you stammered through that. So bad, terrible fucking joke. Tography science. But like in this lens here, there's like five different pieces of glass. So there's just at whatever angle you're holding it, depending on where the light source is coming from, right. It might create an artifact, which would be a little circle if you're dealing with a really nice camera like that one. But what about like with one of them bullshit zipping and shoot ones, then they're using that

Speaker 3:          00:36:34       less, uh, just why there would be some on that. It's probably because it's less, it's less good. It's, it's has less, not the right word, but a less technology in there. I don't know. I don't, I can't explain it honestly.

Speaker 1:          00:36:46       Well, wines, we should Google it because, or Glover's right now are freaking out. Oh my God, they are angels there in front of you. Anytime in or passes near a human, he'll go watch chose reaction as the orb goes behind his hand. Yeah. And you change your eyes or your thighs will change. It was amazing. You don't believe in fucking ghost. I believe in every, you don't believe in guns all in with everything locked that foot back scattered. Here you go back scatter, back scatter. The artifact can result from the backscatter or retro reflection of light from airborne solid particles such as dust or part, but I sell it. Or liquid droplets, especially rain or mist can also be caused by foreign material within the camera's Lens. So these dots are blurred images of dust particles. M night Shambhala, Ding Dong should make a movie in that movie and it should be called backscatter.

Speaker 1:          00:37:41       Call him that anymore. That's really rude. Is it though? It's kind of funny. It's Sean Milan. That's his fucking [inaudible]. I'm [inaudible]. You turn on the day you started it. You fucking put it on me. What are you racist? What's wrong with you man? He makes them good God damn movies, the guy, he takes some crazy risks. But uh, I love the sixth sense. That was a great fuck. Come on. Every, I love the village. People didn't like that and see, I thought the bill was the end of it. I was like, where, what about planes? They, they, they don't, they don't show any planes going over. It would have to be to avoid all the planes. Well they have to be in a shepherd plain to places where no planes flying remote cause they made it out so the road and then instantly the guy to the road and people are like, Hey, I like what they're like Saint Louis. It's like right there. You know what I liked though? His ghost. No Devil. The one was in the elevator. That was a good one. Yeah, it was good. That was good. That's good. Well he takes chances.

Speaker 2:          00:38:36       He takes a shower like, hey wait, that's this. This reminds me of you tell when you talk about that island, that private island, do you know, sent in a lot, sent, sent or sensible or central island planes still fly over that or no. Are they not allowed to sign it as a restricted airspace? I don't think it's restricted. No, but you can't land there and you can't circle. Right. You can't visit India owns it, right? Doesn't the co it doesn't India control of leaves and it's like 10 mile radius. I saw a thing online that said a boat crash there and you could still see on Google images the remnants of the boat. Yeah. They came for the people in the boat too. And the helicopters got them off the boat. Right as the people were like pulling up and I'll say they live and shit.

Speaker 2:          00:39:14       Yeah. Fuck yeah, they, they live. But those, the villages were common for them. Oh yeah. Can you imagine stepping across a village they've been fucked with sometime in the past? You know that a commander Maurice Avi, Dow Portman. Yeah. Guy. Yeah. Shout out to a respectable law on, uh, Twitter. He has a, a, a giant thread about it. It may be pinned on the top of his Twitter page, but explaining, uh, like one of the reasons why those people are so hostile. Right. And it has to do with this British explorer who was really kinky and, uh, you went there to fuck. Who knows, we want to fuck island. He was what he did. But people got sick because you know this, I had this Guy Graham Hancock on yeah. And he was talking to me about, um, uh, all the different shit that they're finding in the Amazon and in South America and that they used to be 20 million people that live in the Amazon and they died off because of sickness.

Speaker 2:          00:40:11       They were visited mostly, apparently Europeans when they came in like the 15 hundreds, they would tell these incredible stories about these huge civilizations in the Amazon. But then when explorers came back 200 years later, there was nothing there. And they were like, this is crazy. They, they lied. They must allied. But it turns out they didn't lie. What happened was smallpox ran through the fucking jungle and white people, everybody, we did it. And then these, the jungle just overtook the cities and now they're finding these cities with something called Lidar. They use these planes and they circle over this area or helicopters or whatever the fuck they do. And they shoot this shit down this lidar. It's like laser radar and it gives you a detailed image of what's below the surface and what's their shit. And it shows them all these crazy structures, all these like, uh, like roadways and irrigation systems and circles inside of a square.

Speaker 2:          00:41:04       Like it was villages and cities and the millions of people probably live there. Look at it. That's all the stuff they're finding that, yeah. And all of it was swallowed up by the jungle. They think within like a hundred years just vanished in the jungle. Oh, because it's so, so lush and tropical down there. Dude, it was one of the most amazing podcast I've ever done to listening to that guy. Tell this story right after this one though. Now you are the best. You're the best. This is kind of, well, this is like a, this is like the findings

Speaker 3:          00:41:34       of Atlantis, right? Like when they started finding, you started finding more and more land under Christine, this, they found traces of five drugs including dimethyltryptamine on a thousand year old South American ritual, key empty baby. That's like proof positive, um, evidence that it at least 1000 years ago they were using Iowasca. Wow. This was the drug pouch that was made from Fox snouts. That's so crazy. It literally, when you see it, it looks like they used everything and the first crazy, it looks really nice and knows. I wonder why they do that with a Fox. It's probably like some cleverness something though that that's what a showman, that's like literally what a shaman is supposed to. That's what the definition is supposed to be in certain cultures, certain cultures. It's a clever fellow. That's who the sh the shaman is. Okay. I kind of make sense. They are just clever fellows, but I mean imagine that like he takes a Fox, that clever little fucker.

Speaker 3:          00:42:31       I'm going to take his face. I want wanted fucking drugs in his face. Only a person would think to do something. So great trucks and this chipmunk cheeks. Yeah, right. That would be the good little, yeah. The little pouch sugar pouches that hangs for your belt. It's just chip Monck sheets with all your coins in it. The dump. What about the dumbest animal? You could have stuff ed. What would be the worst animal to put stuff in it? Gunks skunks. Raccoons or raccoons are actually kind of smart, you know? Do you know skunks are predators? This little creeps? They are, yeah. Yeah, Bro. They were coming from a chicken's, Oh yeah. They try to eat your chickens. You want to kill your chickens? They skunk up the for this spray him and shit. No, they're just there to kill the [inaudible] only spray things when things come near them.

Speaker 3:          00:43:12       When they're or when they're about to die. Right. That's like the, when they think they're going to die, they just admit that. Yeah. That's like so many animals are able to do that. We're like one of the only species that doesn't know how to fake death to have to avoid actually dying. Right. A lot of species we'll hide or change colors or shapes and we're a mid something to give the other species, the, the, the, the thought that they are dead or deceased or that they've, you know, they're gone. We don't do, we don't, we are the only ones. Don't know if you're running away from a fight, you can't just pretend to be dead and then they'll stop fucking, you still gonna fuck you up. Well, human beings, well I think humans and chimps to, they want retribution. He want revenge. We love vengeance, man.

Speaker 3:          00:43:49       That's like our favorite thing in the world. A guy almost fucking hit me four times today. I wish I got his license plate. I called them out on here and he was cutting me off and he kept trying to hit like hit my car after he cut me off in a big like f three 50 truck and then I gave him one of these fucking Hawk like, dude, I mean just miss my car, you know? Then I move on. Well he pulls over next to me, gives me the finger and then tries to like pulling my fucking lane like he's, he, if he's going to hit my car out of his, I was like, it's okay. He just knows. He just knows his car hits my car. His car has barely any damage on it. He knows a big f three 50 trucks. His tires the size of my fucking car.

Speaker 3:          00:44:25       He was a dick, but he wanted shit. So it's like now vindictively I hope I see him again. Like now, just want to fucking see him again somewhere in the city. Just started. Just this guy. I want to have that moment with them again. See Him outside of his fucking big truck. That's funny. Yeah, we love, we like I, I don't hold grudges. Like Bobby Lee and I were talking about a, Bobby holds the biggest grudges on earth. He some of the worst. I mean he has like 20 year grudges. Really? Oh my God. Bobby Lee ask him about it. He genuinely, when someone does the wrong thing to him, like I'm not talking like makes a bad mistake. When someone does something where you're like, that's fucked up, that can fuck up a friendship. He will hold that against you for the rest of time. That's it. That's it. Where some people would go, whatever, man, I forgive you. Shit happens. Nah, he's, he holds a fucking grudge, dude. Bad. That little tiny ball. Rice ball has a lot of fucking vengeance inside of him. He's my little dump. How dare you? I'm allowed to say that, man. I'm allowed to say that because I uh, because I used to own Bobbie. I used to buy, bought him for a month.

Speaker 2:          00:45:29       How much did it cost? 65 grand. That's a lot. Did you anything, any, did you have to feed him? He doesn't really require that much food. Now when does he get to own you? That's part of the deal, right? He owns you for a month. 10 years later. 10 years later. He owns you for a whole model with me for a month. Yeah. Then he's going to be stewing on it for 10 years. People really did do that. If they just decide, okay, you can own me for one month. Yeah, and I'll do whatever the fuck you want, but then I own you for one month. 10 years from now. That's a great movie. By the way. This is a crazy deal. It's [inaudible] alive. Meanwhile, like nine years later, that dude's just drank in and chain smoke and try to kill him to kill us because it was a flood of figures slave for a month.

Speaker 2:          00:46:10       That'd be like indentured servitude, right. Mostly was people that were too poor to make journeys are too poor to do something. So they would give up a certain amount of like they would make a contract, like they would work for someone for a certain amount of time. Right. That's essentially how we set up. Yeah. I mean that's basically what it is basically saying like, but it's, yeah. Is, it's like a slut. I mean, I guess the condition is probably varied. You know, one of the grossest ones I ever saw was, um, uh, vice did a piece about Dubai, I believe it was, and about, um, some people who are unscrupulous, uh, construction people would take these folks in from Third World countries and promised them all this money to work there. And then they'd take their passports away from them and then pay them a fraction of what they're supposed to pay for them so that they're trap and they were living in squalor, trapped. They don't have their passport anymore.

Speaker 3:          00:47:05       Human trafficking is what it is. I mean, that's the same as when they do to these young girls. They had these girls come over to the United States, you know, uh, I think it was a documentary on Netflix about these, like young Russian models, right? And they give these goals modeling contracts. They live in, uh, you know, like a four bedroom apartment, two girls to a room, right. And they essentially, you know, fuck them around for a little while with small little weird, maybe random gigs. And they're like, hey, if you want to make more money, you could always sell your body or sell pictures of you. Nude makes way more money and they think it's kind of part of this modeling thing, and this is like a content. I think it was a d, I think it was on Netflix, but it was all about these girls getting trapped and they can't go back. They don't have enough money. And this, this modeling agencies, modeling agencies, these are these manager, manager agencies there. Well we have to keep your money and we'll give you like a a salary so to speak. We pay your rent, we'll give you food. It's horrible. But

Speaker 1:          00:47:58       if it was dudes, I wouldn't care at all. Yeah, of course. Of course. It was true. It was these five handsome guys came over from Russia looking to get some pussy and drive Ferrari's, but it wasn't really working out for them. But like get a job, get a job. It's switching gears. Where the fuck did you think was going to happen? You're just going to get pussy and Ferrari. Get outta here bro. I'm good looking. I thought this would make me make me say I'm sorry I can't get you any modeling gigs, but if you want to make some money, fuck this old lady. Sup. How much for two grand for me to fuck that old lady. Okay, so all you gotta do. Do I have to come or just hang with her for awhile? She has to. She asked. I have to work with Hotel Chicago. Yeah. So you got to work with her. Okay. You got to be a good act. No eating pussy. I can't do that. Oh, you have to do to proceed. I have two, three grand. They don't even shave old ladies. They gave up. Okay, so eat Harry Bush for two grand. I'll do three grand. Three grand. [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          00:48:55       right. How much sympathy would you have for their watch to show Gigolos on showtime? I didn't, but I know shop watched it. I know Tom and Christina loved it. They talked about it a lot. Why is it that shop right there on the right, so they stick it ran its course. It was on for like seven. No, it was not up for 60 g's. Interviewed one of the guys that belief, by the way,

Speaker 3:          00:49:16       every TV show I've done is only gone for like two years, but Gigolos gets six. That's the state of television. Jesus Christ. That is crazy. That's a very, that's a very good tell by the way. There's like not a lot of these, these uh, this whole like the culture of male Gigolos I think they said percentage wise it's like unbelievably smaller. These guys that get into the Gigolo world and stay, they all get, they get in, they get out. Most women that get into sex work, La last significantly longer than these dudes way, way long for very varied reasons. But I think the Gigolo thing is kind of like a moment in a man's life where he's like, I want to fucking try it some young like fun, loving free for all. It's like open mind. I'll just give it a world and he gets right out. I don't think that happens for girls at all. I think women stay in second.

Speaker 1:          00:50:01       Would you feel bad for some dude who was working as a Gigolo in his pimp was shook night and it's pimp was making them go out there, eat that pussy now to make that money. It's the website for it. I just know on a website for it. Yeah. That's actually writes really good poets or this guy. What's going on within Vin Armani? What's going on when he works at the coffee shop around the corner from my house. Why is he wearing in Charlotte? Thought that's just how it says. Look Dude,

Speaker 2:          00:50:28       Bradley, Lawrence, Nicole. Hey man, I ain't hating. If you could sling Dick and get paid, good luck to you. Look, some people do it. Some people out there working as a misuse that do not like touching people. Okay. Tell me how much that is. That's a bummer though. How much different is that then? Being able to be a guy on wear. Nice shirts like that and occasionally got a bank broad. You don't want to wear nice shirts, so horrible. Look, you get some nice now. Fuck. The world could be worse. Do you remember Richard Gere? Wasn't he a Gigolo in one of his movies? Who is, he didn't have a movie called Gigolo. We'd like bang old ladies. I don't know if it's called Gigolo, but yeah, he think it was called Gigolo Gigolo. That's right. Boy, you must have loved this shit. Yeah. You know, she gives up their bag and ladies, here's what they don't tell you.

Speaker 2:          00:51:13       Most of that money and that Gigolo world is sucking Dick. Okay. If you want to go out there and suck that Dick, you can make that money. But if you just want to bang old ladies, ah, Whoa, look at the difference. That's when he was young. That's when he was how old you gotta be like 22, 23. Um, he was pretty young and handsome and then father Tom done fucking Molly wop him all the time. Got Him. Marvin Hagler on Thomas Hearns third round. I remember when he went on stage in New York after nine 11. Who did Richard Gere did and, uh, was trying to tell the audience that they should choose love and that, wait, we're not state state where on stage she, he was on stage at some sort of a benefit. Oh, right. After nine 11. It was right after nine 11. And he was saying essentially that, you know, great message.

Speaker 2:          00:52:03       She was, at the time people were just blood thirsty and they booed him. They're like, fuck you. What are you saying? Fuck you. He's basically saying let's not have military action. More people shouldn't die because of some things that these people did to us. He's saying try to figure out a different way to do this. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, he's, he's, he's a Buddhist I believe. I mean, he's really like, he's really close pals with the Dalai Lama. Yeah. But, but, but in the interest of talking about what we're talking about, revenge means a lot. It's Kinda hard to tell America to not get revenge on somebody. Right. We love revenge. Well, yeah. Well, we love getting back people that have tried to fuck with us. Even if we go, even if we go way deeper than they did were warlike monkeys. Yeah, we love it.

Speaker 2:          00:52:42       We we, we when, when we think we're being attacked like retribution and revenge is, well we're just talking about earlier about like chimps. Chimps do that too. Natural, it's nature, nature, nature. You want to get revenge. Motherfuckers like we were talking about that guy and got ripped apart by the chimp rent to bring a birthday cake. Dude. See other chimps that did it because they were jealous. They were angry that that jealous of getting this compassion. You didn't get shit and someone fucked up and left the gate open and they came out. Fuck that dude up. He ripped his limbs off toward his face part just because he wouldn't give them, didn't bring cake for them where they female chimps now there a man, where's my cake losing it? Cake must be so must've been good ass fucking cake to a chimp that doesn't understand what cake is like.

Speaker 2:          00:53:29       Hold the fuck dude, you do this. But they do understand what cake is. Wherever they understand it. Once you get it to them, the gem. Yeah. It's something, it's, it's, that's like a powerful or be brought. That's how you want more in Costa Rica. And uh, there's, there's monkeys everywhere. That's crazy. Cool. Cool. Last monkeys, but there are a little sketchy. I know. I got married down there and oh, he did. And Costa Rica. Yeah. Yeah. They're out. They're out of their fucking mind. We were hanging out with them and uh, there's a thing called a [inaudible] Monday. You know what that is? No, they look like a, like a raccoon monkey thing to weird creature, a rocky. And uh, they would come up, we were staying at this resort and they would just come right down the pathway to where your, uh, your door to your room was and they'd just hang out with you.

Speaker 2:          00:54:11       Like these Quad Mondays just hang out and you could feed them grapes and shed. They would take them right out of your hands, but it like no danger at all. They were like super chill and friendly. So we gave this quantum Monday some grapes, and then he laid down and took a nap under my chair. I just took a fucking nap, like a dog was a dog and like the most chill dog of all time. I'm like, God damn, these things are cool. Like we were just sitting there. It just check, oh, go ahead buddy. Tickets, take a nap. You're safe here again. Some grapes and shit. People want it. Want chimps at their house. People love the idea of, of having them. So the monkeys came over and we only had a, that's what a quad, a Monday. It looks like, dude, they're the shit.

Speaker 2:          00:54:47       There's, there's such cool little animals. It does kind of look raccoon ish. My daughters gave him a fake name, like a, they were calling him a Kinkajou. They just decided to call it a Kinkajou. What's more fun? Yeah, they could choose made their own word up, I think. I don't think that's a real word. Kalata Monday, but that little that'll guy was so cool. So she's an interesting little fella when you just would gently take grapes right out of your hand gently, right the most chill dog of all time. So anyway, we were out of grapes and these a monkey showed up and they're, they're like hanging out, like looking like, what do you got for us? These guys are hungry. No real monkey that's on a monkey. I don't know what that is. I don't know what a cold water Monday is. What family is, what is that?

Speaker 2:          00:55:28       Anyway, we gave these, uh, my killer, like I don't know if we should give these monkeys, these Oreos. It's Kinda fucked up. Like it's not good for them. I'm going to look at, one of them only had one hand. I'm like, well that's not good for him either. The fucking handbid off. So I gave him, gave him that, he snatched it from me and he opened it up and then started chewing the white stuff like the cream. He's one of us, but he already knew about it, knew to like, he's probably getting Oreos for his whole life time from people that stay at the resort. He knows the trek. Did he? I mean he knew what the fuck to do. I'll do it. Well they make you at this, you know, they're all open air houses. You rent on the beach, you know that everything's pretty open except for the bedroom is the only thing that's closed off. And they had latched locks, padlocks on the refrigerator. And I was like, what are you guys lock that up? And they're like, the monkeys know how to get into all that shit. They know how to open the door and they know how to get into drawers. He's like, dude, they knew how to, they know how to open up egg cartons.

Speaker 3:          00:56:24       They know how to open the lid and take eggs and close the lid. I'm not kidding. He's like, they're that smart. So in the middle of the night, the first night that we were there, I hear the gate kind of rustling and then I hear movement and I'm like, someone's in the fucking house cause it's on the beach. It's wide open. So of course I like grabbed something is the biggest thing I could find. Nice man. I'm out there. I'm like, Hey, hey, you know, like a nut bag and my fucking arm, um, yelling. Of course I look it, they're just monkeys. Chillen trying to like get shit in the house. They're trying to find shit laying around food, drinks, whatever it was. And of course I go back to bed and every night I would hear them come and go, but you'd hear them try the refrigerator. They would hear him pulling on it to see if the latch was like, if we left it unlocked.

Speaker 3:          00:57:04       They're smart, they learn, they learn, they learn all the little tricks of where you put stuff. Cabinets. I could hear a cabinet is opening and closing. Yeah, they were smart man. That's so weird. It's like a little person. It is a little sneaky, but yet it was a little person. He fuck use it. And they, and they put purposely up in this place that I was at, um, they'd purposely string wire from house to house to house. So the monkeys kind of had freedom to go up above because if they would go down by the road, it would cause more traffic and disturbances and all that stuff. So they keep them up in the canopy. They put rope purposely house to house and tree to tree that humans put up. So they have easier pathways to get down to the water because they say when they're down on the ground, it's more distracting.

Speaker 3:          00:57:43       There's, you know, it's a lot harder to drive. They, they create little messes down below. So if they keep them up high, it's better for them. It was crazy man. What a wild little creature that can swing from tree to tree and they fly up and down the tree tops like that. There is a guy from shit, just one most like people sometimes I'd see one just hanging. It'd be staring right at you, but they're almost like people. They're so, they're the right fucking there. Well the weird, the weirdest thing is that if, if evolution is happening all the time, looking at this little monkey junk, is this in breaking into a house? Yeah. Watch, watch this. Watch how smart. Look, he'll give me those chips. I love these fucking chips. I love that. It looks like he's looking right at the person too. Yeah, he is.

Speaker 3:          00:58:23       Oh Wow. And he just takes off with the chips. Do they know which ones they eat them? They know which ones they like. Just be nice to them. What happens if you feed them? You can't know. They tell you not to feed them because well then they know to keep coming back and where they can get food for like monkeys now they say at the end of you and they say, if you don't, if you swing, you stop feeding them. After you fed them enough, then they start to get aggressive. So then you shoot one and he said, tell him, send a message. Right? And then they all come back and kill you out of fucking 12 gauge and you blow the little face off one of those clients and you make your drug and you go, hey, you guys want free food. You'll get it. But you get it on my terms. Mcgee, go back inside. You just described a plot for a planet of the apes. It's literally like the plot for planning. You get them hooked. Yeah. You Bait that I'm hooked on food. Yeah. You Bait them. There's a lot of places like that. Um, we're, we're, animals are dependent on people. They were dependent on people to feed them and it's a, it's a little squirrely. Like whoa. There's a place in, I think it's Jamaica where people swim with wild pigs. No, Wild

Speaker 1:          00:59:22       Bahamas, Bahamas. Now wild pigs generally avoid people they don't want to have anything to do with you and they're dangerous. Sketchy. Yeah. Wild boars are nuts. Yeah. But in this place, people have been feeding these things for so long. They have trips like tourist trips where people fly in, feed these pigs and swim around with them. Pig Island, they got wild pigs that are constantly being fed by people. But a friend of a friend went there and someone they were with got bit. Oh yeah, I've heard they put them in the ass a bit. One of the, one of the pigs bit them in the ass. And it was because they didn't have any food or something like that. They didn't offer him anything. He have to keep feeding them throughout the whole thing. It tells you all about it that they, that they get really ornery and they get really annoyed.

Speaker 1:          01:00:03       Fuck you. Fuck you. Fuck you just drown it. Just put it right under non bro. Those they're strong now. They are. You can't fuck with those sentences. The animal, because they're beautiful and they're sweet and the like pigs are there are weird one and it was there. Look as cool. Look, I'm a dog lover. I love dogs. Pigs are almost like a dog and maybe smarter close their Pr. The probably definitely smarter, but they liked the way that we react to people and it, look, if you feed them and you're their friend, you become their buddy, but are you against eating them? No, but also looks I've killed them. I know that kills wild ones, but wild ones are different men because they're out there hustling. Okay. They don't, they're not in this fucking pen getting slop all day trying to fatten them up. Right. It's hard to get fat out there.

Speaker 1:          01:00:48       They're out there. How much more lean meat out there. They're much leaner, but they're also vicious man. They're v the getting rid to grow these giant tusks, they have these big fucking fangs. And the crazy thing is there's the same species as a domestic pig, right? It's the same animal. Just once one's one's pampered and one's not exactly bring up. Have you ever seen Havoline Aleena's do you know what [inaudible] are in Arizona? Peccary well, when I saw that it looks just like a pig. Yeah, that was when I first, when I first moved to Arizona, I saw one and I was like, oh, what the fuck is that thing? And my buddy was like, no, no, no, don't cut it. They, they'll come right at yet. They will fucking go for your legs bad because they're real low to the ground. But he's like, they'll start spearing you and they'll come at your legs.

Speaker 1:          01:01:25       And one time I was valeting in college and when I was up way in the up in the mountain and it's some dudes, you know, some private, huge private residence. And there with packs, I mean packs of them and I could hear them rustling around and they were like positioning themselves because I was, we were parking cars where they were living and I was like, we can't park cars up there. You can tell they started to get aggressive in jumping and diving at the cars. Yeah, they were getting fucking annoyed, man. They didn't. I was like, we can't go back up there. We're going to get fucked up by these little bullshit pigs. You don't, we're Stan hope lives out in Bisbee, which is real close to the border. They have them all over the place. Yeah, they're everywhere. They killed one of his friend's dog.

Speaker 1:          01:01:56       They do kill dog. They, well they, they're known to kill cats more, but yeah, they do kill dogs because dogs are about, depending on the size of your dog, there's some of those, some dogs could fuck those things up because they're not that big, but they, they're known as murder cats. It was a small dog, I think. And I think they flanked it and it just came at it from the sides of the part, the real part of dog. What do you do when someone, something like that kills your dog? Are you out with a shotgun? Trying to find the rest of them did. I was trying to kill coyotes after the eight my chickens and I don't give,

Speaker 2:          01:02:20       I mean, I love chickens. Like they're cute. They're my friends. But when they died, a couple of them died of natural causes. Yeah. I'd be like, Aww, poor little guy. But if my dog died, it'd be really sad. You know what I mean? It's a different relationship. Different. So when these coyotes killed my chickens, I sat out there on the porch with a bow and a range finder waiting to fuck them up for days. I even tied one of the dead chickens that they killed to a pot, like a, you know, that you would plant in. What are you doing, Jamie? Um, the Po that you plant things in. And I sat it in the middle of the yard as bait. Right. And I sat up there waiting. David, one of them came and my daughter screamed out a coyote and I'm like, God damn, I got to teach her how to hunt.

Speaker 2:          01:03:03       Like I had that motherfucker that's, it was inside of these inside of 40 yards and he was creeping in. I was like, aw. I had to do is get to my spot and I would have probably got a shot. Yeah. How 40 yards. That's a far away [inaudible] he was at 40 yards when my daughter scream. Oh Shit. Well then, then he's like, fuck this. I stayed up there for a few hours longer. What's the, what's the furthest that you can feel comfortable hitting a target for where the little target, you know, there's a difference between something that's the size of a coyote. Coyote is only like, they're not paying, their body might be like a foot, a foot and a half. They're not big at all. Yeah. They're tiny from top to bottom. So what we're trying to, if you're trying to hit them in the vitals, you don't have a lot to aim at.

Speaker 2:          01:03:47       It's a very small bag. Dot. Yeah. Yeah. Want to be, you'd want to be fairly close. I think about that all the time. They'll go with a rifle, you could shoot them. That's not something totally different. I tried to kill him. I only grew up shooting rifles. I never shot a gun until I was in my twenties but rifles, I was so used to shooting. I got so accustomed to shooting it and then I tried to boat once and that was unbelievably fucking hard. You should learn. It'd be fun for it. You can always come here and practice. I'll come next time. John Dudley comes into town, I'll have him a hook you up and they'd love it, man. Not even like to go hunting but just to shoot targets. It's really fun. And that like guns though. That game out there. I do too. Yeah. That game out there that I have that uh, techno hunt gay dude.

Speaker 2:          01:04:31       Once you get into that and start playing that once your [inaudible] at a screen, you're fucking good at it. Oh, fun. I had Corey Anderson, UFC light heavyweight. He's a bow hunter. I had him here the other day and he was playing it cause he good. He's really good. But you could tell like writing me, he practiced. He so fucking elite athlete of course he's going to be good at, but one thing. Yeah, that's true. What do they not, so he's got this discipline mindset and you know, it's just on the ball. But um, you could say right away when you planned, it was like, oh my God, this is so addictive. I'm like, this is the most addictive game of all time. Once you started, it's hard to get let it go. If you're an actual bow hunter, you, you only get to shoot a thing like a couple of times a year.

Speaker 2:          01:05:11       Yeah. You know, if you're going a lot, if you're going a lot like the idea that you're going to shoot a lot of like tea, if you're some Ramey warrant type character or Cameron Hanes, yeah. You'll shoot a bunch of deer a year and you live off those. Yeah. But if you're a regular person, like you think how many deer you think you're going to find, how many deer you think you gonna sneak up on if you're lucky, one or two a year. So like the moment when it happens, it's such a big moment. You're like, fuck, here it is. Here it is. We're trying to stay calm and stay calm. But with that thing you're shooting at them all the time. Just fun. So it's in your head. So like what I'm seeing is this animal moves and moves into the pocket, boom, the release pop and it hits it perfect and you see it over and over and over and over and over again.

Speaker 2:          01:05:53       So what you learned from martial arts and what you learned from standup, it's the same thing that applies to bow hunt. It's about repetition. The more you can do it and the more you see it over and over and over again, the more that pattern becomes your mind. So that gate for it, for a guy like Cory or someone like me, you bow hunts that games like, Holy Shit, this is what I've been looking for. See a real animal walk into range that would, cause you always want to be ethical, right? You want to be able to shoot the right animal. Like you want to be able to hit it exactly where you want, where it expires very quickly. The best way to do that as well as some difference. So this game is just super addictive. What's it called? What's the game called? It's called Techno Hunt Techno.

Speaker 2:          01:06:31       Ah, can you, your score against each other. So if you and I were playing it like you give 10 points for a Bullseye, eight points for the vitals, you get like five points for headshots. Where's the shot? No, no. It would have to be a very small subset about headshots learning, like playing gun games, first person shooter games. Over the years, headshots are always the most rewarding thing. Like, oh, add shot. But you don't want to do that with an animal. Do you do if you have a rifle and you want it to die instantaneous. And it is a, the way they do it that some hunters that are chefs do it when they like hunters who are chefs. Um, there's, there's two different kinds of hunters, right? There's a hunter's that eat the meat and they, but they want, they want to shoot a mature animal because that's what everybody strives for.

Speaker 2:          01:07:17       It like if you're a skilled hunter, like of your, a Steven Rinella or someone like that, what you're trying to get is, uh, an old wise animal. It's already spread its DNA and it's mature and it's probably the end of its breeding cycle. That's what a guy like that wants. What he's, he's like the ultimate hunter, right? What he wants is the most fair chase. He's never hunts in high fence operations, the most fair chase, the wildest animal, and he wants to get the oldest maturest one. But then there's chefs and chefs believe some of them do. It's very debatable that the younger animals tastes better than the older animals. So they're not trying to get an old mature animal. They're trying to get a, a young, um, a tender animal that isn't like fully muscled, ripe, worn out with a, you want some, you want some stills tenderness to it, some softness to the muscle. But then there's people like Hank Shaw who's a, also a world famous chef

Speaker 3:          01:08:16       who's also a hunter who prefers older animals cause he thinks there's like there's flavor to them and there's life to them like that they're, they're aging and they'll all their life experience, it comes out if you cook them correctly, it just requires a different sort of preparation. Right. It's Kinda like, it's Kinda like a young women versus older women. Like young women have a lot of positives about them, but older women have just as many positives about them. Older women that flavor. That's what you want, right? You want to check who's like, yeah, who didn't give a six plus who hits the gym every day. I know. Trust me, I know. I, I've had this conversation about the whole night because when, if we stop working out, it's over. I said, if we stop working for like we, if we stop exercising and carrying water health, it's all there.

Speaker 3:          01:09:00       It's over fact. No, I mean like I wanted a sign I wanted my, uh, and one of my lawyer has a joke to sign document that says if we, if we get fat, it's like a free and clear gone. But I mean it, if she gets fat out, if I get fat, she should be out. If either of us break this thing that we're doing together, what if it brings you closer that we get, she gets fed to worry about body image anymore. Fuck you just let yourself go. Fuck that. Come on. Fuck that shit. Hey, hey, hey shaming right now. We can realize it or not. Hey, I know you don't want sham show you fat. Fuck, I can't believe you. I just think, I think we've made a bond together. We made a pact where we're like, we both want to stay relatively healthy and take care of ourselves.

Speaker 3:          01:09:41       So in our older years, like my parents are both in, in really great shape because they've cared their whole lives. Not to a point of like, you know, not having fun, they still have a great fucking time, but just they just stayed consistent with a caring about what you put in your body and the way you work as simple shit. So yeah, if she gets fat by, if I get that she's by two, if I get fucking fat, she's gone. She even said it. She was like, I'll leave your fat ass being fat. It's such a weird one that people call people fat who aren't fat. Right? I mean it might be, but I'm just saying like as an insult. It's such a weird one. It is because like girls will call girls fat. Like that fat bitch look at our is not fat. No. What he's saying, it's just that, let's just say it's a dig.

Speaker 3:          01:10:22       It's another gift for you. You Fat. Fuck the guys who say that. The guys that like barely have any fat on bed. Fuck, we need to know the cheeseburger. Jamie. You Fat. Fuck. Fuck that it, it's an easy day. It's an easy insult to, to how to grow. Call me fat at the con. There's a video of it online. Who girl calling me fat at the comedy store and a pull up my sheet, my six pack. No, like long time now. Crazy. But it was like, why am I am I'm fat? Like what? Where are you coming up with that you're affecting you're fat. I bet you it's a weird thing. The the, the fact that the body can carry excess tissue. It's a mistake. Like I get it. It's a good way to store fuel. And when it gets to a point like why are you still hungry? What kind of shitty system do we have that you're this big and you're still hungry? Didn't attempt to break and say, hey bro, bro, bro, Bro, stop.

Speaker 2:          01:11:14       We got the fuel. But it does not put to your bodies and working off carbohydrates. That's a problem. Right? And it's not burning fat. That's why that whole ketogenic diet works as much as people don't like to think that it does. There's so much controversy about that, like from nonscientists, which is hilarious. Have you talked to actual scientists like Dom D'agostino who talked to you about the peer reviewed research? That's been done on ketogenic states and all the different benefits and what you know and how it could be healthy and how he does it and Ketone esters and all these different factors you have to take into consideration and they'd ketone testing and blood testing it. There's all these knuckleheads saying it's bad for you. It's not a good idea. Like Julian Micheal. It's like it's not a good idea. It's not good. You finished up, they say that as a benefit.

Speaker 2:          01:11:55       Sam Pounds, right. It's a normal state. It's a normal state for your body to burn fat and you have more clarity and you'll also, you're not as hungry. You're not as hungry during the day. My team, my problem with it is I don't think it's the best thing for performance. I think like you have a little bit more energy if he, you burn glucose too cause even like the top, ah, there's a Zack bitter. He wouldn't even when the American, he ran 20 he ran a hundred miles in like 11 hours around a track. These guys that could do this shit. It was some crazy record. Two miles and I need to chill for a minute. Some crazy, some crazy record for a hundred mile record. He broke 11 hours, 40 minutes second. That's insane. That a minute mile, seven minute miles or a hundred fucking miles. Now he is on primarily a carnivore diet. All meat, all meat, rib eyes, and barely eat barely any meat and fat.

Speaker 2:          01:12:57       Barely any greens. Right? Barely in Greens. But then when he competes, he takes a lot of uh, glucose. Like he'll take like glucose gel, like those gels. Gel packets. Yes. And those runners use, yeah, he, he pounds in that shit. Pounds in the carbs. So he could burn that off too. Right. You know, cause he's living off for like fat and protein. But when he competes, he doesn't do that. And the thing, I think that's the key. You're saying when he competes, he does use the glucose, but when he's done competing he does. He goes back to putting his body in a fat, a fat burning state. It's a pure carnivore. Our diets are kind of crazy as I don't like pure, just, just meat and nothing else. And saw the eight man. I know you, Jordan Peterson has done it now for over a year and he released his blood work or the results of his blood work. At least everything's in range. Everything's healthy. Supplemental vitamins, nothing. No, he doesn't do anything. He eats steak with salt on it and he drinks water. And I'm telling you, listen to me, man. If he gets a Perrier with lime in it, he'll spit it out. He doesn't want the lime in a fucking Perry and that it's yes. Crazy. That's too much. I lost 50 pounds, 50 pounds, 80 pounds,

Speaker 1:          01:14:12       lost 50 pounds. He had some serious immunological, uh, issues. Um, immunological that'll word and know. Yeah, it sounds made up. Yeah. I Dunno. He had serious immune deficiency. He had immunity, immune deficiency. Immunological Bob. But doesn't it sound, it sounds phony. Yeah. It sounds fake. Immunology and immunology, you know, but immunological sounds blood bullshit. It sounds like you took two words and put them together. Where fake sophistication, sophistication, he'd some serious issues, um, as helped. Yeah, dude also suffered from depression. All that stuff. Look, a lot of what they think that a lot of the issues that people suffer from, they suffer because of inflammation. And when scientists are studying things at the carnivore diet, what would, what's striking to them almost more than the fact that you're just eating meat is that you're not eating all these other things. And so that in giving your body only one food source to deal with, sometimes your body can eliminate a lot of the issues that it has.

Speaker 1:          01:15:13       And it also mimics like some of the benefits of fasting. It's, I'm too stupid to be really judging this. I don't know. I'm listening to all that. I know that I'm fucking dumped too. He had like receding gums, he had some serious gum issues that all went away. All these things went away when he was on that carnivore diet for you. Okay. I don't eat like that. I'm not saying eat like I don't eat like that. I think it's gotta be a balance, I think. I think some people may may work with that, right? But they'll also tell you there's so many diets that people do that their blood doesn't line up with that diet. It's not good for them. Right. Some people that just works with, right. Some people, some people can have higher intakes of red meat and other people, it's really, really bad for their system just because of the way were blood is, well some people are literally allergic to it.

Speaker 1:          01:15:51       Right. But like uh, like my wife needs way more iron, like needs like has to happen. So whether it's supplemented by pills or by higher incidence of meets with higher iron in it comes a lot of vitamins in it and some iron. I'm Natalie, I can't produce any more man. None. They cut off my balls. Doo, Doo Doo. I turned him in. Yeah. What did it, what caused you to turn them in? What was the final straw? Was this movement downtown La Barista at your own gender? Yeah. I went to the me too thing and I cut off my balls and I left him there. So I just, I donated them if you like, if people started calling for that. If girls are calling for that, guys would do it. Remove your nuts. There's guys out there that would, there is a certain kind of guy that would, there's so many people there.

Speaker 1:          01:16:31       If you called for guys to step out into the middle of the town square and cut their own balls off, at least a couple of guys would show up. I can name two to send us. We live in, there's a couple of dudes I know that would fuck up that exactly. Just for like Twitter credit. Yeah, just for some street. I just, I just rather read tweets. Love from is how you are an ally. Boys learn like my fed. Like we were favorite. Like your favorite shirts. Yeah. Females kick ass or what is it? Oh women kick ass or whatever else. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That'll hold the idea of like a of a, of virtue signaling overt, overt support for

Speaker 3:          01:17:10       something. It's so seethrough when you're like, I'm here for you girls. It's so seethrough. God, it's such a crock of shit, but the, they can feel that way without yelling at all the time we pull. You also like broadcasting like that. Like what? What are you doing? Yeah. What are you doing? What's the purpose? Yeah, that's what I like. Why? Why are you reaching out? You're supporting, what do you supporting? What is happening here? It's another instance of the echo chamber doing the whole supporting the thing that I don't think people are really, I talk about it on stage about the Trent Trent, the word transphobic over like I understand the meaning, but I also think it's hyperbolized and in essence of like there are these large groups of people that are against trans people. I don't believe that whatsoever, but there were definitely are.

Speaker 3:          01:17:54       I think there's small groups of people that get a lot of attention. I don't think there's massive look. The KKK is significantly larger of a group. Then whatever group you want to formulate of a transfer of trans phobic nature. I know a lot of people don't even know what that is. Right? I haven't done any statistical research. Look how many KKK members are in the United States? There are tens of thousands. Okay. How many people? What do people do? I think a trans people religious that, that don't believe in trans people or they don't think that they should be able to call themselves a woman. I think Ma, I think most of those people don't care enough to call themselves part of that category. They just disagree with they go, I don't really like it. I don't get it. I think, I think there's more of those than there are people that are like adamantly against trans rights.

Speaker 3:          01:18:37       I think we have to take into consideration what we already said about God's willing to cut their balls off that there are guys like that or sure. There are some, there are so many people in this country. I guarantee you there's a lot of trans phobic people a lot. Cause listen man, if you read the comments and I don't, and I didn't, but someone told me that the comments and the Eddie Izzard uh, Instagram posts that are made were horrific. But don't you think that is an internet fodder? See that's my thing is I think people like to say shit on the Internet, even if they don't believe it, because they know that gets attention. If they go, fuck this fucking dude looks like a chick that I don't know what they said. Maybe they were just making fun of the way he looks. So you can, you can assume what fucking people right on the Internet about that, that issue.

Speaker 3:          01:19:16       They would just go, what's up with this? Fuck. Oh, here. I'll give you an example. I tweeted the other day about the met gala Harry styles. Uh, I tweeted a, uh, he was wearing like a lot of men were wearing like dresses at the met gala. This was a whole thing. And I tweeted, Tilda Swinton looked fire at the met gala because he looked like Tilda Swinton not cause I'm saying like, who's till the swim? She's a fucking actress who has short hair, right. So right. That was him. And I said, Tilda Swinton looked fire at the met gala. Who is this gentleman? He's a, he's a pop star. He's like part of, what's it called? One direction. He's part of one direction. What? What is happening with that shirt? That's what he wore to the met. Callous. What'd you say Jamie? It's a blouse. Blouse. Shirts versus blouses. Okay. Here's the thing. If you're going to one of those things and you're going to stand in front of all these jackasses with cameras taking pictures of why not wear a fucking blouse? That's what, that's what, but I said till

Speaker 1:          01:20:07       the sweat and looked fire because when I saw the first image, his face kind of looked like Tilda Swinton. Okay. Of course I'm making the joke about a joke. You're a comedian. Well, dude, everyone was like very funny last night. Thank you. Thank you. Everyone went after me. Everyone was like, oh, of course you fucking, I mean Habsi are you a Nazi? The, here's my problem. They go, um, he, I think he's gay, right? Is He, is he gay? Jamie? No, I think somebody told me they were like alone. They were like your, your, your menu. I was like, Whoa, I can't make fun of people anymore for people. I said he looked like till the fucking Swinton. Why are you reading comments? Because I'm not as famous as you stop and think about the amount of people that have had their balls. I know that would just walk into that town square and cut their balls off.

Speaker 1:          01:20:49       Now stop and think about those people commenting. Yeah, I know. And you're reading it and allowing it to fuck with your head. Sometimes I feed into it. A lot of times I don't. When do you not? When I'm confident in whatever I posted. That's interesting. Right? We're not like that joke. I knew it was going to be misinterpreted. Like I knew when I wrote that I go, some of them misinterpret this. Who Care? That's why I still posted it, but, but I read some shit sometimes if I go, I wonder if that was dumb or if that was cool. Wouldn't it be fun if you could be half drunk all the time and never suffered any physical consequences? Me, you know, I'd love that. Nothing would make me more happy. Love drinking, but with a half a buzz on, you know that feeling when you got to half of on it?

Speaker 1:          01:21:29       Like my favorite thing in the world because no one could touch me. Just feel good. You know how I know that feeling, hanging out with your friends, having a buzz and not worried about it. That's how alcoholism starts. I think that was a lot of members of my family had half a buzz all the time, but well, half a buzz all the time would be a, it's like a, that'd be a good place to be. Maybe. How many [inaudible] how many chats are good? Half of the bad half. You came a little little like that feeling you get after that first glass of wine when you're like, ah, why do you think people have wine at lunch? A lot of people show up work. I sushi had someone was drinking a bottle of wine by herself yesterday. Is that league, like if you work in an office and you have a glass, did they let you have a cocktail at lunch?

Speaker 1:          01:22:11       Totally. It depends on who you are, where you work. If you listened in our industry, entertainment street, there's no fucking rules. Well, obviously, but I'm saying like a regular, but do you remember the dude who used to run the Tempe Improv didn't want you doing shots before you go onto the note, no drinks before you pop a conversation with me about it. He's like, do you really need that? And I was like, Hey, hey, listen to me. Look at me. I'm a professional, right? I'm also an athlete or I work out a lot. I'll be fine. I'll be, I'm going to do this or I'm going to go to the gym. You want to work out with me? Yeah, we'll shut the fuck up, man. Come on. Just on the club, dude. I'm not, I'm not going to get so drunk or can't talk. I'm having a shot. Yeah. Four I perform. If you became one of those guys, yeah, you would know. Everybody knows. It's like I know what I'm doing and even if I have too many, if I have four or five instead of two, I'm going to be okay. Like I'm growing up. I'm still figuring it out. Driving anywhere, drug. I'm not doing anything stupid

Speaker 3:          01:23:06       working tonight. In fact, there's nights where I've had a few, cause I've been sad about where I am, like I'm at a club that I don't want to be at or something and I'll have a few too many, but I'll get on stage and the first thing I think is I still got to put on a show. I still got to work hard, but I'm a little, little drunk, but autopilot kicks in a little bit sometimes. Like back in the day, if I was sad about the small shitty room, it would just kick into the jokes I already knew were going to work and I was kinda going through the motions. I was still delivering, but it was sad because you're like, I'm not, I don't know if I'm enjoying this or I'm going through the motions if I'm just kind of like, Hey, this is the joke.

Speaker 3:          01:23:38       That's the joke in my mind is just on a Rolodex of like this joke, spend that joke where now I'm just had a happier place in my career that now if I do, if I did get a little too drunk for, I want to stage, I'd be genuinely nervous. I'd be nervous about my performance level. It's like fuck him. Are they going to hear me slip up a little bit? Am I going to cause I'll feel it because with, with great, with great power comes great responsibility rate. The greater the rooms, the group, the bigger the rooms, the more power, not me but with, but the bigger the rooms get, the more I feel more. I feel more responsible to do even better than I have been doing.

Speaker 1:          01:24:15       Do you walked out on stage in San Diego in front of 13 13,000 people and own that motherfucker is fucking wild. It was wild. It felt, you know what it was doing in the round.

Speaker 3:          01:24:25       It was weird to do the round. I, I don't know if I love it. I don't know if I loved it or hated it, but it was this feeling of such uniqueness that I couldn't judge it in the moment like it was too. It was happening so fast.

Speaker 1:          01:24:36       There was no, there's no sitting on the stool and there's 13,000 people. There's no stagnancy. You have to keep moving. You're moving around the whole title. Yeah. I liked it. It's interesting. It was wild because the screens are so big and everybody could always see your face no matter where. Yeah, it was. It was good. I loved it. 13,000 human beings. It's a lot of fucking people, son, who's very weird by the way. I'm going to Denver. When is that? What does it know? Jamie's gimme give wrong information? Jamie. Jamie just blurts things out. Just takes chances. 24th of September, he's been slipping a little bit. Have you noticed Sanchez draw? What's been going on? Jamie? Half Trump all the time. You have bust. It's August. August what? 23 and 24 hours. 23rd I'm at the Belko theater. How did you not know that? Jamie and I just belted that out.

Speaker 1:          01:25:20       And then you have the fucking computer. August 9th I'm in Portland and August 10th I'm in the bay area at the shoreline. Amphitheatre yeah. Oh Shit. Oh Shit. Oh Shit. Oh Shit. And have some fun dude. Fucking, hey, we go to Chicago. I'm going to go with you to Chicago. Austin. Austin was a good guy. Incredible. Incredible. It's so good. Yeah, it's great. Cap City, you know, one of the best clubs in the country. That's like it. I think doing those clubs, like doing weekends at clubs is real valuable. That's, I got to, I'm going to book more of those, you know, it gets great always to be working at the store and it's great when we're doing these big places in the road, but those clubs, there's something about like if you've done xannies in Nashville, never done Sandy's Nashville, let's do it. Zany Chicago. I've got never Nashville. Let's do it. Okay,

Speaker 3:          01:26:04       let's do it. Let's got that pleases Shit. You see that the punchline in San Francisco follows and so the parlor live, the part of their lives going down to the punchline is closing forever. They might move it. No, no, no. Here's what's happening. This is the real report. I read it. I read a, an article again this morning because last night Ali Wong told me, and um, I read the article that was posted this morning and it basically said they lost their lease. They couldn't renew it because it's got, that building's getting bought out basically. So they are working diligently now to try to relocate the club. So we just need to find a new look. Yeah. But it, but, but for the time being, it's going to be gone. You know what I worry about? I'm worried they're going to go big like did with cops, right? Like I used to do cobb's um, when it was not, I don't think it was 150 seats.

Speaker 3:          01:26:48       It was tiny. Right now it's like four 50. [inaudible] it became, it became the opposite of what you used to be. Right. It used to be a place that you would go, you'd make less money but you'd have more fun cause it was like real tight. Everybody was like smashed into this place and it was a legendary place. That's, that's, that's easily one of the best and I want it to go back, which kind of sucks that it's going to be gone now. The reason I love this club so much, so what you see is the stage and tables and behind us, which you can't see as the bars in the back of the room, which is one of my favorite elements of a cool club. You don't need to worry about people getting a drink to the side or the left behind. You can't hear an ice machine, but it's in the very back of the room and they do such a good job of hiding their noise and they're distractions.

Speaker 3:          01:27:28       So it's all about the show. They were fucking so good at it, man. They're really good. I hope they keep it intimate venue or really do. Yeah, I love that room. Needs an intimate venue. Does San Francisco have a good comedy scene these days? I hear, I hear a variant of stories. I think a lot of people would say that was better back back, you know, a couple decades ago. But I do think that when I go up there, when I had been up there, there's a lot of young people that are really good that are coming still out in northern California, but I mean cobs and there used to be, um, what is it? Green onion? No, the purple onion. Yeah. That used to be there. There was no, there was one more. Is that what it's called? Why does it sound wrong? I don't know cause I'm saying it sounds wrong.

Speaker 3:          01:28:05       No, is it the purple onion look up. The purple line is like, I think you're right. But it sounds, it's one of those things, yeah. Where you're like, the other thing, we talked about it again, that sounds wrong. You're like, you made that a logical immunological. I'm, we're gonna open up a club called immunological purple onion. But I, I, I don't know shit about the fucking San Francisco scene anymore because the only clubs that I've done are, the only things I've done are punchline and I did cops I think Zach Galifianakis special at live of the purple line? Yes. That's right. A small price to per blended. Yeah. It was tiny, tiny sat gone. That plays, I think that's not there anymore. So the like for like real intimate spots on the road, like you still have Atlanta. Atlanta has got one of the best places. That's that's that's gone.

Speaker 3:          01:28:45       Gone Fuck 2012 yeah, it was called to close in 2012 God, look how intimate it is. Small. It is the only other venue that's like that that's small like that still is like you're talking about laughing skull is still small. That's still tiny. Tiny. What does that seat like? 90 I think they said 90 yeah, a hundred a therapist, a packed out stuff and I'm in there. I went, I was in town doing something. I went over there to watch garland to watch Jeff to Jeff's thing. And how was it? It's just Jeff, Jeff, Jeff. Jeff is so unabashedly clear that he's just fucking around like he was. So obviously like I'm going to fucking do this whole set about one guy and he picked like picked the guy in the audience and he the entire set about the guy and it was just like, I'm just fucking around.

Speaker 3:          01:29:31       He was having some, he was having tons of fun. He's a sweet guy. He's hilarious man. He's here, he moves. He is, his brain moves, uh, very fast in a way that I wouldn't anticipate. Right. For some reason you think I, you're like this is he quick is that he's very quick. He's a fucking, he's a very cool, funny dude I like to do, but yeah, I haven't, uh, I don't know. I'm starting to do a few new clubs now and in the size, the sizing is different and I just, I like to be able to do bigger places, but I love intimate venues, man. A tiny, there's no way to get, there's no way to get that feeling of how when you're there all, it's all different, man. There's no way to get that feeling of 13,000 people either except for fucking that a fucking arena.

Speaker 3:          01:30:16       Different feel. It's all different, man. It's all different. It does. It's all worth it. Yeah. I think you gotta be on a steady diet of everything. Yeah. It's like you don't want to be just a carnivore and only do 13,000 seat arenas. You don't want to be just, who is it? Who's your carnivore? Who is at Jordan Peterson? Is that how of this? Yeah, he's the only one of them that I know. I know several people that are on the cardboard diet. I can't, I can't get innocent because I still like bullshit. I'm not going to not have ice cream once in a while. I'm not going to not have a fucking couple of French when I'm that guy. I'm going to work out, but I'm also going to have and do what the fuck I want. I just, I can't get on that train. I suffered for a while doing a crazy diet.

Speaker 3:          01:30:53       Would you do, I did. I did. I did this. Um, it's almost like a circuit likes how circuit workout is. It's like circuit dieting where it's like one week without, do you know what that is? No. Yeah, you did. You, you, you get rid of an element that's kind of a vice, right. Whether it's like a, and if it's a, it's gotta be a heavy vice, right? Like it's like I've high amounts of sugar in my diet, so it's like I do a week completely without sugar and then I do a week without meeting. Then I did a week without you, I don't know, fish or whatever. I kept changing what it was to find how my body reacted to it and I fucking hated it. The fucking hated it. I was like, I'm a much more balanced person up here in my work and my writing in my exercise and my sleep and my fuck life when I just get to eat what I want. Regimented Lee, that's a fake word. Fuck. Life. Regimented life. It's a better question. Fuck lights the name of my new album. That's a good law. Now she get that tattooed across his fuck life. I'm much better. Why do you say fuck life? No, no, no, no, no, no, no. The fuck, fuck, life. The fuck life. You know, I'm into my fucking on the pump. Got Bug life

Speaker 1:          01:32:00       regimen regimen. Mentally, mentally. Regimentally see that sounds fucking wrong. Regimental lead like I'm better off when I just, when I do, when I just balanced, when I go, I don't need that shit. I should need that bullshit. And I poke in and out things once in a while. It's, that's just, I don't know man. I think that's almost like, that's the only way to live for me to wait for it to work. I've tried shit. I can't do it. Yeah. I think people like going on diets cause it gives them something to concentrate too. That's what I'm saying. I have shit going on. I can't worry overtly all day long about like, is this meal going to, is like, how am I going to get fucked that shit. But that's one of the things that people like about it. Like, okay, I'm on this diet now I gotta concentrate this.

Speaker 1:          01:32:40       Is it like meal prep? Really? Um, yeah. Or meal prepping. And Sunday prepping all up inside of me where I look at my shows in Melbourne for trader, no prep. I am in control of my world, asteroid hurdling towards us. I'm a complete control of him in control, getting rocket space. I have a finite lifespan. I have to constantly eat and shit, but everything's fine. Everything else is okay. Everything's fine. My buddy texted me today by the way, I was, he goes, uh, he had a concern I talked about on another podcast about how he couldn't, he didn't shit for like five days. Oh. I have a buddy who went through that and he went to the doctor and he has this thing and he had to get help for, he texted me, he goes, I just want to let you know I'm back from vacation.

Speaker 1:          01:33:19       I feel really good. Also, I'm shitting like normal again. And I was like, I feel like a like a really proud friend. Like he, he was really struggling. He was nervous about it. He was like, dude, I haven't shit in like four days. I was like four fucking days. Who was the guy that had worked with on fear factor. I don't want to shame them so I won't say his name and he wants it out there. Great Guy. Um, he had a real problem, a real problem. It was packed in there for days and days. It wasn't coming out and he could feel it like you could touch his bottle and feel it inside. It was hard. It's hard grows. So fiber dog had to go to a doctor and they literally had to chip it out of his asshole, shut the fuck allocated, impacted it chisel in his blood hole.

Speaker 1:          01:33:57       They had to get in there and break it up and then they had to make him take this like really intense laxative. So it takes this really intense laxative, like like weapons grade laxative and they're in, they're chipping away at the stone wall, which is essentially just like a dam to keep all this shit juice. It's piling up. Dammed it because he's got the impacted dried out shit that should have been out of his body days ago. And then he's got the fresh shit on top of that. At the top of that, he's got this camera goal laxative that's just sending off explosion the side of the dock. It was a fucking hammer hammer and a screwdriver just whacking at the ship rock that's at the bottom of his asshole and then it breaks loose and just explodes everywhere. Fuck. Like he gave birth to a dead seal. Just fly it out of the capsule bag. All right, we got it. We got it. How much did you, how much weight did you lose? I don't know. But he said it was awful.

Speaker 3:          01:34:58       It was awful. Like they had to pry the shit out of his ass and break it up. It kind of paints pains. Those downstairs to payments. I can't imagine from, you're not shitting. Yes, it's it. What's it called? A, um, you give yourself, um, imagine that. What's it called? Come on. Look it up. You know what I'm talking about?

Yes. Why? Because she didn't want, she couldn't move to shit. She was so fucking big, she couldn't move to shit. So the shit packed up and they were like, you're gonna fucking die. It's going to get in your bloods. It's going to get in your, uh, your other organs in your bloodstream and kill you. It like, doesn't that freak you out when you watch a show like that where someone's like, like, uh,

Speaker 2:          01:35:59       uh, what are those called? Hoarders, like a hoarder or someone who's gaining a ton of weight or something to get there, but you know, that you could get there. You know, you couldn't get there. But you know that a person could get there. Yeah, right. You right. You now Andrew Santino May, 2019 you're, I are going to get there. No, probably not. You're fine. But some people how bad road and they can't turn around. They're stuck. Yeah. And h but they compile it. Right? Cause that cause the depression feeds the hunger feeds the depression. Yeah.

Now we feel bad. Jamie. Thanks. Jamie. Fox baiting us with some shit. Still look at that guy and almost died from constipation. So it's a few people. Every year they had to surgically remove two liters of poop up coca cola bottle filled with poop to leaders to lead it. Think of a liter bottle of coke and picking two of those fill with sand and stuffed up your ass shit and your ankle is sand leading to a lack of blood flow to the leg and was pressing on his artery, bro. Oh my God. It was, his shit was choking his leg out. That's what was happening. Shit was just Chinwag Army Shit Hospital for 23 days and took 13 days for you could walk again. I'm like, boy, no explanation has been found yet as to explain his significant faecal loading, uh, loading constipation, looking the spell, fecal

Speaker 1:          01:37:56       f, a. E, c a.L is that because they're in Australia? Fucking those idiots. The guy was probably bang kangaroos or something and he caught some disease. Those people, no time to pope. I'm faecal loading bang and Kangaroos. Have you heard of that? Um, coupled that they ate a raw rat heart from Mongolia and they got the black plague. What? Yeah, they died, exists the black plague from fucking fucking crazy people. Liver. That's what it was. A liver. They ate a raw rat liver and they died of the bubonic plague. Why did they eat it? Take or bubonic plague? I think it'd be Bonac play black sounds like it. Yeah. It's gotta be bond. They have a bionic play. What's the difference? Cause Obama plague was a bacteria, right? Well what's the black plague? That was a virus, right? Wasn't that a virus? What do you at Doctor?

Speaker 1:          01:38:49       Not, not anymore. I got disbarred. Apparently you're not going to like keep them. You can't keep the faecal loading. So you were in college. What did you think you were going to be comedian. Really? Yeah, like this is a waste of time. It's just funny because I had my, my modeling throwing shown Andrew Santino no case on his phone. Yeah. Fuck that shit. One of those gangs, the black plague was a, an event during a time period and the 13 hundreds and the bubonic plague is a thing you can get right. But the black plague the plague was what? A viral disease that was killing people. Right? So it's the bubonic plague that these folks got and they got it from eating a raw rats, heart or liver. Think it's liver can look at us. What does this, kidney, Kidney, oh, that's in high school. Why would they kidneys? Is it something that you wrote? Yeah, that's in high school. Oh my God. That you wanted to be a comedian and says, I wanted to be, I want to be a queen. I want to stand up comic and to work with comedy on television.

Speaker 1:          01:39:51       Yeah. I'm willing to do whatever it takes. Make It. Yeah. So it says I want to do anything. I like what I'm hearing. Whatever it takes, whatever it takes. Look at, I wrote below, I want you to wear a track suit with no underwear and meet me at the doc. Got It. We're going to get on my yacht. You got good time. Let's go. And I got a part for you to read my script. Oh, imagine some guy takes you out on his, on his yacht. You're like, wow. So you really think my tape was good. Ah, yeah, you tape tapers. Amazing. We're going to show you that are listening. And he, he brings you this script and it tells you what's required of you. And then you're out there in the middle of the water bobbing around staring at this guy and he got a couple of glasses of wine.

Speaker 1:          01:40:36       He was like, I'm gonna make you a star. I need to get my dick sucked. Okay. I gotta get that Shit. I get it. I did write in high school anything it takes. Now imagine being a woman and you're in that situation. You think you're gonna be able to sweet. Talk to that guy. Right? That's why you were flirting with them and that's why he got close to him. He's, you're going to get a part you to play him. You got to get apart. Next thing you know, you're on that ocean. Well that feels creepy. That feels rapey and is rapey right? When you're a dude, you'd be like, fuck that guy fucked up. Just sacrifice man. For the role that I'm saying. It's a different feeling. Totally, but still dangerous because if the guy finds out that you're not willing and then you might be hostile and then he might be hostile back like your two dudes.

Speaker 1:          01:41:18       One Dude want to get his dick sucked by a dude, but you're both two dudes and it's a real hair raising situation for both of you. What are your healing for him? It's hair raising, right? You tried to get this guy to suck your Dick and the guy said, I'll fucking kill you. And you're like, Jesus. Now I gotta drive this guy back in my boat. It just me and him, a guy who said he would kill me, a 20 foot long little boat. Yeah. You got to sit while you got to make him sit up by the bow and you'd just drive quietly. Do you do jump in and log? That's where people kill people. Like you know he's going to tell people. Yeah, totally. That's how he gets good. That's why that's where that kid from Iowa goes missing. Went to Hollywood for big dreams, never came back, is out on the water.

Speaker 1:          01:41:55       Cement shoes my friend put on the shoes. Yeah, I guarantee that's happened. But I guarantee you the guys tried to get a guy to suck his dick and the guy tried to fight them and they fought to the death academy. I'm sure it's happening now. There's got to be right as we're speaking, there's gotta be listening to this murder. Gay Guy is choking them to death. Doesn't want anyone to know. Don't go on the boat unless you really know the guy. That's my, that's my message. How well do you know the guy, man or women, if the guys a producer and he takes you on the boat, don't go on the boat. I feel like that about it. How well do you know the guy with the boat? Not that, well, I'm not going on the guy's fucking vote. I was on a show once and there was a guy who was kind of a, he was a, I don't want to be mean, but he was sleazy.

Speaker 1:          01:42:41       You're just a Hollywood. How's that mean? Calling out someone for being fucking sleazy. Sleazebag but it's the most stereotypical version of, ah, and uh, there was a Gao who's also working on the television shown, choose young and flirtatious and next thing you know, they were on his boat for the weekend working on the script and they came back. We were like, it's like you really just said that. Yeah, we are, we're guys creatively, oh gosh. Working creatively, just out in the middle of the water the water gives me, and being at Unis, the water makes me feel a type of way, but it's like normal stuff. Like that's what people did for this business. Yeah, he used to be. But Jamie, you wanted to bring this up because you can sort of talking about that and we never, oh, well this was a different subject, but I'll save it.

Speaker 1:          01:43:26       This is a Ed buck. Do you know who that guy is? Like, no, he's like this democratic, uh, he's a a donor. Oh, right. You and I talked about were 10 to two dudes had been found dead there, um, from drug overdoses. So they'd come over and one guy said that, what did he say? That. I don't know what they've said, but like I think with him makes him do drugs or he or he's taking them in while they're already super high and he's helping them out or something. They die and they ended up dying water. They're claiming that he's helping two people that I think that's what it is. Coincidence is maybe he's telling the truth. Maybe like, yeah, he goes out there and finds really high people keep trying to save people in the middle of the night. What do you cynical bro? Yeah, Dude. What do you think is happening?

Speaker 1:          01:44:12       You want me to take a wild guess? Yeah, I bet. He goes out looking for people that are real fucked up to get back to his apartment to get some fucking Dick. What? No Way. And then that side that's, and then they say, do you have any more drugs? And he goes, you bet I got more fucking drugs. They do more drugs together and they die and he dies and he stays alive. Whoa. You sure? Case closed, your honor. Are you oh directed. I rest my second gentleman. Mr. Buck. Okay. Well it looks like a fine man. It looks like he doesn't do anything like he's got a nice gold tooth shining in the back of his mouth. Like a, what's his name? The wet bandits from home alone, investigators found multiple sex toys, multiple syringes and clear plastic bags with suspects. Suspected methamphetamine in a toolbox roll cabinet in the living room.

Speaker 1:          01:45:01       He's got a tool box filled with syringes and sex toys. Let's go to work. Clear plastic bags with meth. More has been homeless and how it worked. How it says Ma bags. Clear plastic bags like more than many. He's got bags of speed. He had been homeless and it worked as an escort. Yeah, that's, he was on that Gigolo show. Season Four. He was one of the main guy. He's the guy. I become addicted to. Drugs in the Bush is the one to thank you. Gave me my first injection of crystal meth. I become addicted to drugs and the worst one at that. Well, I don't know if that's true, but it's crazy story that the, what we do know is true is two people died over there. Yeah. That's fucking insane. He's all, oh, hey man, it's just g is there, there's different standards, right?

Speaker 1:          01:45:52       Like here's, here's the thing, like if that guy, if he was a heterosexual guy and two women had died at his house, prison for life, what are the odds that they wouldn't arrest him? Zero. Zero, zero. Zero. If one woman is found dead in your fucking apartment, yeah, if you could, we're going to go to Chris hookers and shoot them up with meth. Yeah, you go to jail, go to prison. But if you pick up mail, look, it's like what we were talking about earlier. If it's a guy like, ah, you're a Russian model. You came over here to that work, Bro. Fuck the old ladies come on. Like, that's true. But these guys, two guys are dead and everybody's like, Hey, you know, that's the fucking game they're playing. They Odi playing that shoot the math game. Once you shoot Sean, you, he's the only killed two guys. What the fuck? That's kind of like the, the, what is it? The, uh, the, the staircase. You know that documentary where like two of his wives died falling downstairs. Oh yeah. That's, people are like, what? You still fucking know.

Speaker 3:          01:46:50       You think two women coincidentally magic they did. They're your favorite people ever and they just kept falling and pop it literally impossible. What if you're a rock climber there? It was in his kitchen. Is it is fucking kitchen. Did he throw second? Al Did it. What's this crazy dude? He has such a fluid. He said a bird flew in and scared her and flew out of the home because there wasn't no fucking bird by the way. But he said a bird flu and scared her and she fell down the stairs backwards. By the way, you know how hard it is to fall back down the stairs backwards when you, when you're already at the top of a stair, nobody falls backwards when they're walking upstairs. Kicked Sparta, someone has to hit you down the that's exactly the, the lawyer was like, somebody pushed you down the stairs. That's the only way that happens. Sparta. Sparta, fuck you. If they did an autopsy and they see the footprint right in the middle of her chest. Well they said the blood splatter was like so obviously consistent with someone that was like thrown downstairs. Well the how will god her Bro and these hours are doing that. That is a thing that happens off fly into your home. They fucked shit up. They're not good guests. They're not nice people. Assholes. Yeah. They really are truly not nice.

Speaker 2:          01:48:03       There's such a cool animal. Yeah, they are. They're a weird animal that we like. Think of them as these wise old creatures. Like we, we, we have like an anthropomorphic version of an owl. Yeah. That's really smart. Like an owl is like, well yeah, like read off the, uh, find out what's going on. The tootsie pop owl. How many licks does it take? That was like he wore glasses. Yeah. Well that must be what it did. But the wise old owl is like an adage, right? Yeah. Why is it though? I Dunno man. Because they're fucking ruthless. What they are is just cunts that's swooped down and kill rabbits. Rabbits up, man. They're wingspans are fucking incredible. When you see them take off, take flight and it comes snag something. It's, it's wild to safe driving home once and one was flying over my head and I guess it didn't like how low it was as to where my car was on the road.

Speaker 2:          01:48:53       Like hit had picked a path probably not in its head. Understanding the cars go down this road. Right. It was flying. Right, right. And the car was just too close. Who just dropped the rabbit and went to get it later. I pulled over cause I'm like, what the fuck was that? Because it was big. Like whatever it dropped was a fairly large creature and a, I went over in this rabbit that was just gutted because the first thing they eat is the guts. Right. So to just torn the guts out of this rabbit, they pick it apart and then they take the rest home with them. They swooped down. Have you ever seen a, an OWL's clause? Yeah, they're fucking nasty. Either. Huge giant ass clause that the coolest video. Look at that thing. Look at the closet that they're bad ass. Dude, I mean, God, it's an amazing one. Predator. The first picture, it looks like him saying don't take a picture. And in the second one he's like, why did you take the fucking, I told you not to make a pitch cause it's like mad at you and she's picking it up. Look at the eyes

Speaker 1:          01:49:48       in that thing, man. I mean, it has a demonic face that's like beautiful Predator man. It's an incredible animal. Um, but look at that one. There's an amazing video online of one killing hawk. It kills a hawk in its, in its nest. It swoops down in the night. They got a trail camera, Frodo. They had these, this, these hawks that were in this nest and these a wildlife biologist. We're filming it and this, this ego, this uh, owl comes in and watch this and just snatches the Hawk right from the nest. Watch this. Here comes in the distance. You'll see it's a little eyes any second now it's crazy shit to watch the little baby Haka. Yeah, yeah, yeah. A little baby. Look at that. Watch this motherfucker come in and look at this like, Oh shit bitch, whoa, fuck, that's a wrap. Son snatched it.

Speaker 1:          01:50:40       I'll get the mom is like, what happened? What happened? I don't even know what. That's a mom. That might also be another baby. It's pretty big though. Yeah. It's hard to tell. It's hard to tell because we don't have a perspective. But look at this. Look how it snatches it. Bang. Just to hand look all the feathers of fly off. Two hands grabbing a hold. I don't know why that freaks me out so much now. That freaks me the fuck out. Bird on bird. Violences weird, crazy dude. It is bird lives matter man. But it's bird on bird violence is strange cause it's almost like a cannibalism. It's, it happens so often. Yeah. Is Jack Birds because they don't give a fuck. It doesn't matter. They don't give a fuck. But do you think that's a last resort? Kind of. They don't really want to eat other birds, right, bro?

Speaker 1:          01:51:20       Everybody eats birds or the next picture. Even birds. It's a bird swallowing chick. Yeah, look at it. Look at it bucking and it's his throat. Fuck what a Twat. Fuck. That's a fucking whole duck. That's huge. Yeah. Yeah. Look at that thing. That is huge. Well it's a check. It's not a fully grown duck but, but it's big. It's big enough that it's crazy that that thinks swallows it. You know the one of the really fucked up ones and I saw a recently, I saw a toad eat a rat or a mouse. I totally want to see that. Your mouse? Yeah. He's either frog or a toad. I don't know what it was. But a big ass green frog looking type creature swallowed a mouse hole. Watch this. This is it. Yeah. This is crazy dude. Oh this is not, it does not it because this one is hidden.

Speaker 1:          01:52:09       There's one that's not hidden. There's one where you could see it like in like a little glass container. Damn. I wish I could find it. Um, cause it's a really good one. It's from like a top down view. That's pretty good. Watch this. I didn't think that frogs ate mice, man. I used to think the frogs are like, oh, you know, they just get bugs, bugs out of the air watch. He's just waiting. Not yet. Not yet. I want to make sure I get them. Making sure. Yeah. I'm sniff around. Oh, you're close to maybe move a little baby move. I'm on you. And as soon as I decide you're lined up, fuck you. Look at that head first. Just lead it, stuffing it in there with his greedy little fingers.

Speaker 1:          01:52:57       I mean think about what a pro, get them a house trying to get out. The mouse is trying to get out because they don't have teeth. Right? So they just got to swallow that. Get Out. Its head is out, man. Look, it's eating ass asshole first. Jesus Christ. The mouse is like, let me just let me, I'm just curious me. But I guess eat the butthole first cause that's the worst taste. So it gets a bad taste out of how they're thinking. That's just where it was. I think it would have eaten it head first too. But look at it. It's just blinking slowly swallowing the mouse. Imagine you being able to eat a dog. That's what that's like the size difference. That's like you eating a German shepherd, German shepherd and just stuffing anymore face. Dislocating my jaw putting it in. How big is a frog's mouth?

Speaker 1:          01:53:36       That's crazy, but that's I guess when you see those things I can dislocate their jaws. I think that's incredible. Animals that can fucking unhinged their job. Snakes and snakes, that shit. These are fasting charts. Found them in California again off the class after. They haven't been here for 30 years and they just weren't showing up again off San Francisco Center or whatever. What the fuck they they swim through like little schools of fish and they just swallow. I've seen that. It's a basking shark. Giant mouth. Yeah. Wild looking thing. Just like a funnel for the ocean. How many bottle caps are those things? Swallow? Yeah. He was like, what you want to talk about? Plastic straws, 30 feet long. Imagine what kind of shit impacted like six pack tops are assholes. So many old cans of Colin Miller lite blood streaming out of their asshole in this shit.

Speaker 1:          01:54:23       Those things. Got It. They'll say, you've got to be able to handle anything after all these years. They've swallowed so much bullshit. Yeah. Boots and fucking license plates to build both parts. Bones, all that shit. Yeah. Creepy shift from the bottom of the fucking ocean. Whale found dead with 13 pounds of plastic in its stomach. Holy Shit. 13 pounds were so gross. So there was a guy named that. You see that? What does this flip flops and 115 drinking cup. They can't say red solo cups, but that's what that is. People out there partying far down on that boat and I'm sperm whales. Wow. Damn, that's fucked up. And flip flops. I've probably had one of those flip. I've lost so many pairs. I'm one of mine is in his sperm whales. Oh Wow. Did you see the video? That Beluga whale returning the girl's cell phone? What you did?

Speaker 1:          01:55:07       Okay. Yeah. It's fucking, if they set this up, it would have been an amazing setup. But I'll show you the video. Whoa. Returning a girl south. You Go. The whale understands objects are important to you. She knows I phones are expensive and it was how far it got dropped down in the water. But you know, pull it up here. It's going all over Instagram and Twitter. You can use the find the video. I mean it's coming from the depths of the water. So like I don't know how the fuck this and fuck I fucking God holding onto her phone and it brings it up. Like I don't know how you would fake that. Well I they don't look like trainers. It doesn't look like it's in like a, you know what I mean? Like it looks like it's in the water and it says it's the one that was captured last week.

Speaker 1:          01:55:48       I don't know if that the same one. That's the part. I think he was fake about it, but, oh, how do they know? How would they know? It's the same one, but the ones that have it. I think that that's how I initially saw the story and I don't lie. Don't believe that they're tagged and tracked. And I the white whale, the white whale that we posted about last week, well it stuck around. He's been staying at Hammerfest and then for, well maybe it's a different one. Yeah. Maybe it's a whale that they saw and not the one that was captured with the harness. I think that's what's wrong. They're just, well, what did they post about last week? Go to, they'll go to there. That's the one. This is where that story came from and know that's the part why I was so, it is the same story.

Speaker 1:          01:56:24       Yeah, it's trained. It's a trained well, yeah. Maybe you wanted food, man. Yeah, I just thought it was going to get something. Fish. Bitch. She, that's so funny out there. Here's your phone she had, they're like, thank you. And he's like, no bitch fucking feet. And he's just like the monkeys, man. Give Up. Give up the foods. You Bitch. That's what I've come to steal from you. I'm stealing. Oh, that was the other thing that we got Margarita's and we left like a pitcher of Margaritas out and they dumped the picture over and drank the Margarita. They like to party. So the monkeys are probably partying on our porch. They'll leave Margarita's out. Dude. They're gonna fucking say hammered. They get wasted. They must get so hammered like a picture of mark. I don't know how much they lapped up after it spilled. Right. I imagine they probably just drank every drop.

Speaker 1:          01:57:06       There was nothing left. They knocked over the pitcher and some of it must have stayed in the picture and these are like, this is what we want. And they started drinking it and they knock on your door like you have salt. You guys didn't live in the fucking salt out. Okay. He's drinking. Yeah, he's boost out. They drink booze. This is crazy. Drunk monkeys call Nicola. They love Coca Cola. Oh yeah, look at him. He doesn't know how to drink those. Anything with sugar. They love sugar shifts to Fau. He's hammered. Look at him. Oh there. Put a draw. Oh my God. There's videos of drunk monkeys there. Fucked up. Look at him. They gave him wrestle these fall down. That's hilarious. Oh that people spill it off of drinks that they're licking it off. Check tables. If I had a monkey, I get him drunk every day.

Speaker 1:          01:57:47       Me and that monkey, we just party. If everything goes totally south with me, you're going to find me on key west. Live in like those psycho white people just drinking with monkeys going to be messy. Yeah. It'll be the next one. Just like that. But I'll stay in America. Make girls poop in your mind. I don't think he does that, bro. And you should stop saying that he did. Key West is a key West Key West is the furthest you can get and still be in America. Is it rather than Alaska? Some of the most ridiculous thing to call that America. That's like not even connected to Florida and there are those people that live down there. They might as well be ex pats living on an island somewhere. That's what it is. Right. Hurricane there. Every 13 days they'd just get wiped out. The southern most point. Yeah, southern most point. But I mean it's not just that they're there, the keys. They're islands. Yeah. I think you have to drive over land like they're not really America. No, it's its own little thing. It's like Puerto Rico. The US Virgin Islands. Yeah. Get the fuck out of here. How do we own Guam? Yeah. How? What's that? What does that to us there? Yeah. That's way away from Hawaii. It takes forever to get

Speaker 2:          01:58:42       there. How do we get this fucking far Hawaii's five hours by jet? No, no, no. This is America. America. I liked that. I liked that we protect Hawaii, but I think Hawaii is its own fucking thing that those people were on their own country and you know what would happen immediately. Mushrooms should be legal. That'd be the place to party. They voted this week. A bunch of places voted. Denver tried. Yeah. Denver didn't make it though. 47% I think setting those old ranchers, those old ranchers came out of the mountain. Those farmers actually do it on the way here. I saw, I saw hilarious on the bed of a truck on the back of a truck window, had a big thing that says what's going on and it said it had a pot leaf and it said legal and then it had a hose watering a lawn and it said, illegal.

Speaker 2:          01:59:27       What's going on? Oh my God, look into it. That's what he's saying. What's going on. Dumb ass called the drought. Fuck. What's in the draft went away. You can grow water conserving water. You fuck head fuck coupons, plants. Fuck you can eat it had hey easy. She about the guy in Florida that got arrested because he would not take I eat ass off the back when we were talking about that I eat ass. You eat ass said on the back of his window. He said it is his first amendment right to let everyone know that he eats ass. It is. Yeah, but that's a funny thing. Imagine if that's your boy. You have this little baby sucking on your nipple and you're like my cute little boy. He's adorable. Oh my little Billy wants to play baseball but he doesn't like getting up early and he misses a lot of practice.

Speaker 2:          02:00:10       He got cut from the team and now he's kind of depressed. He just plays Madden all day and in one day bill, he's got a pickup truck and Billy's pickup trucks as I, he asked, right? You come home and he's still living at your house cause he's a fucking loser and you come home and you see a little Billy with his I eat ass and do you really need to have that on your truck and I drive what I do do more. That's how I get my ass to eat. A lot of guys don't put our dudes who I love. I know I do. I do. I do. I and the dad is like, I still support them and I love him very much. I also eat ass. Got It from your mom and you're driving on the highway and you're stuck in bumper to bumper traffic with e ass in front of you for an hour.

Speaker 2:          02:00:52       We'd laugh. My mom would laugh. My mom would get mad at me for staying in the same lane. Watch here in this lane because you think it's funny that I have to look at eat ass. I didn't say that mom. I did not say that. It is funny though. You think it's funny. It is very funny. Do you think it's funny because my story about that guy, I know you'd think it was, I think it was more positive than that. I think he wanted to let people know that he eats ass because he's got this ma, he's got an, I don't know if you know him, but we know him. I know him very well. Jamie and I know him very well, but he's got this half of his tongue was bid off by a dog when he was young, so he knows how to eat ass rough. Yeah, he's got it wrong at the end of it. A little bit. Yeah. He knows how to flip it around. Move. He's good at eating ass. But I think people for years where like you can't eat ass anymore Mike. And he was like, fuck you guys man. What are you trying to say to another Florida Man Story? Eating ass

Speaker 1:          02:01:40       man arrested after caught eating ass inside toys r US store. That's why they closed down. That's why they're not in business. That's a bold move. Little kids in there. Oh, I know what I saw it. So around here somewhere it said the thing that game is, there's a monkey on the cover and he's got a hammer. He's trying to whack

Speaker 2:          02:01:58       the moles and there's guys in this girl's pug guys, he didn't girls poop. Mommy, you imagine if you saw a dude eating an asshole underwear, middle of toys r us. You're walking around with your kid. Go, she'll, but should we get, what should we get a wiffle ball bat? You want to play wiffle ball football? And he tried to call it and then a girl and

Speaker 1:          02:02:23       she goes, get out of here. Well, down a rabbit hole with this one with ass eating. Yeah, man. Who ripped out girlfriends intestines for yelling her husband's name during sex gets life in prison. Makes perfect sense. What man who ripped out his girlfriend's intestines for yelling at that point? I get mad. Fidel Lopez told investigators, I get really, really mad. He, he ripped out her intestine for yelling out her husband's name, but that's a complicated story. Awesome. Florida. Oh no shit. She called me the name of the other fucking guy. He told investigators after September, 2015 murder and she said it twice and she was wrong and she was confusing me with him at that point. I get mad. I would get really, really mad. Oh Jesus Christ. As the 31 year old lay stricken, he shoved objects into Miss Nemesis, vagina and anus, including a beer bottle of hair, iron, even his fist.

Speaker 1:          02:03:13       And this is not, this guy's a psycho. This is not something I needed to see. Let a piece of me, Jesus Channel is go. Are you reading about this? Is something wrong with you? Where do you find that stuff, Jamie? Why do you go looking for your saved pages? We'll try to sell you. This is the images of I eat asked Florida man, and I just started scrolling down. Okay, we go to Jamie's like Google ads. It's all duck tape and crowbars and shit. Hey, what's up with all this up, all the handsaws on on man. This is how you know that even when you clear your search engine, it doesn't matter because I clear my shit sometimes and, and even if I want to go back to porn hub, it's still knows my suggested shit. So creepy look into it. Time to look into it, time to look into the porn.

Speaker 1:          02:03:56       That's where there, where people are making money. It's from cookies and like using your information and your data and finding out what you're interested in selling it to advertisers. It's all very, very sorted stuff to Zuckerberg has got us, dude. Yeah, there was a car parked us. I mean it's just this, a lot of it's weird that that sort of escaped the imagination of people that were like looking towards the future. Like they didn't think that data would be so valuable. Nobody really, nobody really saw that 20 years ago when the Internet was first coming alive. Like nobody ever thought they'd be able to like check your searches. Like when they figured out how to make a search engine then tied it into what you're searching for and selling that to advertisers. God, it's genius, but it's, it's crazy that they can make so much money.

Speaker 1:          02:04:52       It's like you were talking about, well, it's not right that you can make so much money telling jokes. Well, it's really not right. You make so much money providing a search engine off of the materials that you've searched, what you're supposedly, you're protected by, right? You're supposed to think that your searches are protected, but on one hand, right, like it's cool because you get all this data, you get to this information, but you know, you could literally find out any answer to any question. We do it all the time. Yeah. But then the other part it's like, well, what am I giving up? You get to now they know what you like, what kind of, what things you're thinking about buying or what you are interested, interested in, what movies you like. They know that. So they start selling you that I like, oh well I guess I want them to sell it to me.

Speaker 1:          02:05:31       That's is what I like. Kind of. It is a nice car. Wow. Look at that. All right. Hit that movie does look good. You know, and then you're like, oh my Google is really working out well for me. You want to become autonomous with the machine. It's just a big net as casting out and just think if they put a chip in. You mentioned you cool with the chip. I've got one already, but you've got the chip dot. Which, which version though? Um, 2.6. I don't know. I don't ask. Just chip, chip me up dog. You got to go to Langley, Virginia. You go to where they kept Hannibal Lecter. That's how they chip you. Chip you out then Langley you got to go to the FBI, but they have to know you're okay. I'll get you a cool chip. May Dude, I'll chip. Shut me the fuck up.

Speaker 1:          02:06:11       What would it take for you to, uh, get chipped? Like for real, if there was a chip and it provided your gps tracking everywhere you go, but you could read people's minds so the government knew where you were all the time. They do. But everybody else that had a chip in it, you could read their mind. Like you could see their intentions. You could, you could find out if they're upset, you can find out the rational or irrational. Maybe you could even show them the error of their ways with your thoughts. Oh, I don't want to just take that shit. I want to know people's head already know where you're at, man. They've got your fucking phone. They can have that. I don't want to know what's going on it like Jamie's had legal want to know is fine. You know he's thinking about right now food.

Speaker 1:          02:06:48       Yeah. It's like three of 20. You're gonna have to move. We upgrade almost. Oh yeah. That is like what it was like, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Remember why he got it. But um, he was, he was shot in a w spoiler alert. He was shot in like a robbery by armed gang members. They shot him and paralyzed him. And then this guy brought him back to life with this chip in his spine that regenerated spinal tissue and gave him super powers and the new Kung Fu and all kinds of other shit. Shit. Me Dude. Yeah. John Carpay. Jamie can out of here with me. You're distracting the shit out of me today. What's going on with you? I say chip me up. Shut me the fuck up. What do you about you, Jamie? What'd you get distracted? If you had a chip inside of you, would you think about it all the time? Yeah. The neural links scares the shit out of him at the, basically the same thing, right?

Speaker 3:          02:07:36       If you're wearing it? Yeah. Oh, you, but do you think you'd like that would become like, you would think about that chip all the time? No. No. You probably, you'd definitely forget about it. Forget about anything else that you have and that you, you forget about this thing that this tracking device on a car, as long as you could pick it up and put it down, but do you feel like you're not really connected to, yeah. No, you absolutely are. But if you had something inside of you, you'd be like, Ooh, pull out when I really went for it. Okay. The chip. Are you talking to it? Yeah. I want to talk to it. The upgrade to turn on my car. Get directions to Joe's. Yeah, forget about it. Then it's close to it, man. You have a, then you just, then it becomes one with you. It's not like you're thinking about it. You're just acting. You're woke you up in the middle of night. He'd be pissed. Why would it wake me up? I told him not to. You know what I've been doing with a Siri lately. The dumb bitch don't use it. I tell her what to do. Um, I make her make a notes for me. Uh, so I go, Hey Siri, make a note and what would you like to say exactly right there. Whose phone was that? Mine or yours or yours?

Speaker 3:          02:08:38       See that she created a note. She's listening to you, dude. Hey, here we go. Hey Siri. Make a note. What do you want it to say? Andrew Santino was the last of the great gingers.

Speaker 3:          02:08:59       Okay. I created a note. Andrew Santino was the last of the great changes. That's a good, that was pretty, beautified it out. She's pretty good. You change was to, is did you say is she did that. See, but it's good enough for me if I have ideas. If I'm driving around, I have ideas. I just tell Siri to do my dirty work for me. It's the best I got. It's like, it's made me capture so many more ideas. I would never be able to capture cause I'm driving. It's just funny. I thought there was in the shower the other day, I spend an inordinate amount of time thinking in the shower. I really enjoy thinking in the shower because it's really quiet and I'll sit there and I'll think, and sometimes I'll get a great idea and in the time it takes me to get out of the fucking shower, forget it.

Speaker 3:          02:09:36       I've washed it away. I want to, I want a notebook. Like A, yeah. Waterproof, no board in the shower so I can write you into one of those. Do they make those? Yeah, but your wife would get annoyed at you. I have home sweet home sign and you have a fucking thing over it so you can write your stupid Oh, Dick in mom's pussy is hilarious. No it's not. And I'll go, you know what babe? I bought this fucking shower. Why is that a joke? Get outside Dick and mom's pussies hilarious. What's wrong with you? Get in the garage where you belong. You're smoking pot with Theo Vaughn. Vaughn says he doesn't smoke pot. I don't believe him. You was just smoking pot. Anybody who talks like that with all those weird hey mans and gang a gang. What is his, who is his gang anyway? Tell him to fix his haircut. Girls are getting mad at you. The way your friends dress. Tell him stop dressing like that or the way your friends act. Why does he do that? Why does he think that's funny to throw stuff to do that? Well cause he's funny.

Speaker 2:          02:10:34       It's fun. It's fun. When he does that, I don't like it. I don't like to so good thing you and I are the same person. Yeah. And you know what? I can replace you. Oh that's a threat. You shouldn't say that to people. They feel like you might, you might replace, are we all replaceable in every way? Literally we're all replaceable. I had Lex Friedman on yesterday from Mit. He's a a, a autonomous vehicle expert in artificial intelligence. Expert. Creepy and interesting stuff. But one of the things he was talking about was like the movie her and that his ultimate goal is to create something that provides companionship to people. I'm like, dude, so immediately I think, can you fuck it? And then I think if it's a guy and it provides, uh, if you want to gay boyfriend, sure, can you make it be gay for you?

Speaker 2:          02:11:24       And that was like the big question. Like if it is so smart that it's like literally like a companion. What if it's not gay? And he was saying we have to face the fact that robots are going to leave us or grow. We're going to make robots that leave us. What the fuck's the point and make it a robot unless it leaves you. What the fuck? And then there was an article about a Pida that was mad at the folks that work at Boston Dynamics because Boston dynamics, they make all these crazy robots and they have incredible balance and they can go running down hills and shit and do back flips. So these engineers were kicking these robots that try to down dog. Well, the dem, no, they didn't think it was real dog. They were demonstrating that it, you know, it can react to pressure and it has balanced.

Speaker 2:          02:12:03       Sure. So Peter got mad and said they didn't think it was cool that you kicked robots. They're really talking about, I don't even know why anybody would want to do that too because you don't have to find on if you can. The only way to find out as your fucking engineering works is you kick kick it. It doesn't have feelings. You fuck, but it does jail. That's where you're making mistakes happen. The type of person that you have to be to say, I just don't think why any reasonable person in front of kicked that rope. Cause you've got to find out if he can kick her fucking robot. How about this? Come on, I'll, I'll pad that robot up and kick the fucking shit out of it. For a workout. Yeah. Like I would like a robot that I could kick. It'd be dope. I would like a robot that I could kick a lot pads and move.

Speaker 2:          02:12:43       Yeah. I want to hit it. Oh, you want to hit it right? I would like to fuck pads. I want to be able to tee off on a robot, man. If you have a real bite back though, it looked, what if it moves at like 30 or 40% that's all I want. I want it to be a little dangerous, but I want to be able to get my shots off. But how do you know it's not gonna fucking kill you? I don't say that. That's probably, it's not going to hurt. It's going to hit you. You know? And I would know when I throw a leg kick and it checks it and I hurt my Shin, I'm like, oh no. When you hear it called Goshen to shit on me and then it starts lifting up its front leg and pressing for it. I'm like, oh my God, my role was going to fuck me up or fucked up.

Speaker 2:          02:13:20       I got it mad stomps on your fucking head. You would have to get something, a robot that's made out of like heavy bag material on the outside and then the inside would just be some of a wire framework that moves fairly crudely. How do you stop it? This is a thing. You're creating a world where we're going to get killed by robots. How do you stop it? That's the real question. The real question is what happens when they get so smart and so powerful that they're tired of our nonsense and this is going to happen. But Lex and I were discussing and he was talking about all the beauty in being a person and the meaning and the meaning that we have being a person and that was agreeing with them. I mean, I love people. I think that's one of the things that's interesting about us is how much we appreciate the things that we, we all do.

Speaker 2:          02:14:00       We appreciate other people's art and inspiration and even we appreciate the way people look. We'd love, we appreciate that. Yeah. Something about the robots don't give a fuck about all that. The, my worry is that we could turn something on that you can never turn back if they become sentient, if they have the ability to do whatever they want, whenever they want to, and they look at us when the sperm whales with 150 flip flops in there, but they're going to go, what the fuck is wrong with people and have we got to fix it? Are they doing like, look how gross they are. They, they eat all the fish and they throw their plastic in the water and whales are eating. They're plastic and dying and they would look at all the stuff we do and then we'll go wide. It kill us. Why are we don't need you around?

Speaker 2:          02:14:42       You guys are worthless. But we are so ego testicle and so egocentric that we can't imagine a world with meaning without us, right? Because we are everything. But even though we're finite, we can only only, only exist for a certain amount of time, but leave behind a legacy that other people could enjoy. It doesn't matter if they're going to die too though, does it, but it does matter. It matters. While you're alive. Okay, got it. The universe doesn't give a fuck about all that and all these crazy robots that take over. Imagine if we got to a planet one day, I can imagine if we traveled the universe and we managed to avoid creating some sort of artificial intelligence because we got hit with a solar flare that killed the fucking power grid or something like that. And when, then we got wiser as a civilization and then we got to a place where we could travel and we traveled to another planet and we got there.

Speaker 2:          02:15:28       And those robots, just robots, no humans, no humans. And they were just running around aimlessly because they'd killed off all the biological life. And they just sit in there operating on the sun with nothing to do and no purpose and no reason to exist. And like what happened and these crazy monkeys that lived on this planet, they decided to for an experiment, make an artificial intelligence and just let it go. Run a muck. And what it did was eat everything it lived off biological material to there's nothing left. And then it just sat there in the sun and waited for someone to arrive. No, that can never happen. Of course it could. That's happening. I'm thinking too deeply about where I'm going to be when that happens. Those Boston dynamic robots are going to have a little pinchers on each arm. Just wrapping everything in front of them and stuffing them in their big giant mouse. Cha Cha. What about the, what about the role that's a turn themselves back on? Didn't that happen? Where was that? Right. That has shut of robot down in Korea because it turned itself back on. If there were shut off, that's what's happening. That's what's going to happen though. The robots are going to start going, ah, I want to be on right now. I don't like being off.

Speaker 1:          02:16:30       It wasn't that something that they were doing with Google. Artificial people in new study struggled to turn off a robot when it begged them not to. Oh, begged them. Not too creepy. I somehow felt sorry for him. Whoa. Please don't tag me off. Chill dude. That I'm telling you when that becomes a real woman like x Mokena. Yep. And you're in love with her and she tells you to kill your boss. Yup. I want to be with you, Andrew. You don't need to go to work. Jamie's for full. Jamie won't let us leave. Jamie doesn't think I'm a real woman, but I know you do. Like, oh we got to, that happened that we were on the way to that happening and we made a deal with them to leave us alone and we got to go to north central island to exist. Uncontacted showing them what would you rather be eaten by a robot or live like a savage savage.

Speaker 1:          02:17:16       Oh my God. Any Day of the week. Let me live off the grid forever like that. As long as you're in a resource rich place, I would take the money that bad. They've lived there for a long time. It's the size of Manhattan and there's only 39 of them though. That ain't good. Yeah, but that's also because how can they repopulate their fucking each other. That's what I'm saying. So how you can only repopulate so much. You can only continue to repopulate within your own. Right. What kind of gene pool they're drawn from. It's only 39 of them. They have to be fucking relatives. They're all relatives. There's no way they've got to, there's no way. They have a map on the island of people that they're like, you can't fuck her remap. Just keep that in mind. They're like, well, there's only 17 choices. Yeah, it's only 39 of [inaudible] either.

Speaker 1:          02:17:55       I wonder if it's how many, if it's male versus female, what it is, but it's more dominant percent men fighting for 15 girls or but fucking [inaudible] get him the girls to get pregnant. The only 39 of them, because they're all gay and like they go skate. It's time to make a baby like now and wow. Hey Girl started crows and they run up to the tree tops. Start Banging each other and looking at the girls. Yeah. Growth. Get really mad because they want a baby surrounded by all these damaged said the sad, the story of sets in the island, dammit. Yeah. They must be to say they're all cousins. They're all fucking sick. You had to live in the jungle. What have you had to live in the junk you'd live in the jungle look like in the Amazon. Like I'd rather live in the desert.

Speaker 1:          02:18:40       The junk. Really? Yeah. Not me. I live in a desert. Desert. Desert. W were you going to do it? Make a house out of sand. Fuck you. Gonna do there. You had dialed there. My dying while you've been a mountain. First of all, you can make a house in a mountain. What carve it out was the last time you were at a desert. They don't have mountains in a mother fucking desert. Usually Los Angeles was a desert. These are mountains all over the place. No, you go to the mountains. It's not desert. There are demos in the deserts. Varied terrain. Arizona desert. Desert mountains. Yeah. They do have some mountains, but they have desert and then they have mountains. Does it know desert mountain? Sure. There is no, once you get up in the mountains, trees and shit. No, not in Arizona. There's, that's true. Some of them are rocky, right?

Speaker 1:          02:19:19       Yeah. Well, you know what's the really coolest when you go from like San Diego and you drive through that area like into Arizona and you find all those crazy rock formations and Cheryl can beautiful out there, man, if you really stop and think about all the different types of environment that exists here in America where you go to Yellowstone and see all that crazy shit and then you can go to Miami and the keys and see all that crazy shit. You could be up in Maine and see the frozen north in Michigan and Idaho and on the train down to San Diego. When we were going down there, I was on the train and I had to had one gentleman and this gentleman like explore like I like I like I like, I like a guy who likes to fucking relax and not be in traffic. I was sitting in the train and some guy next to me was gone talking to some young kid.

Speaker 1:          02:20:05       Some young kid was like, I want to go to Europe. I think Europe is awesome. It's better than America. It's an older guy. He was like, this country has more to offer than you could ever fucking dream. And he was like, what do you, what do you tie? What are you talking about it? And he's like, you can see the beauty of the mountains. You can see the beauty of Alaska. You could see that. And he was explaining all this stuff about that. He's like, I've never left the United States and I've traveled to almost every state and every state gets better. And I was like, ah, shut up punk. Yeah, shut up you little punk bitch, you little pussy. He was pushing around that same agenda though, that he was here. But it is true. The more I travel, the more I'm like, oh, this place is fucking gorgeous.

Speaker 1:          02:20:36       I would have never thought to come here. If it weren't for comedy. I get to go to, we get to go to places where I'm like, I would have never traveled here. There was no reason for me to go to Virginia outside of for doing standup. I was never going to vacation there. I mean, that's true. That's a good point. Yeah. I was never going to go off. And unless you're traveling for work, how often are you traveling to these kinds of cities? Just just check them out. Yeah. Who does that? Maine. Maine was fucking beautiful. I had no idea. Main was that nice. Has like eight people living in it. Yeah, I was nine when I showed up. I got a couple of kids there too. This spots and main where you just drive and all you see is woods for like an hour. It's fucking beautiful though.

Speaker 1:          02:21:10       When you see that kind of like land, like little towns that still just haven't been like butt fucked by pop culture influenced and still have their own thing. We up to Bangor were Stephen King lives. I think he's what they call a snowbird now. Like he lives in Florida and then in the summertime he lives in Maine. That's like my nightmare man. He, he lives in a house in the middle of Bangor and like you could drive to his gate like his, his gait is there and everybody knows this is his house cause it's this big ass house. I bet it's a s k on the fucking gate. Well it has the rod iron gates have like gargoyles on them and shit. So it's like everyone knows it's his house kick shit. But he gets like Weirdo showing up, banging on his door and stuff, trying to give her a script house.

Speaker 1:          02:21:50       Wow. Yeah. It's a dope old house. But I mean he lives right, doesn't there? Doesn't it looked like Stephen King lived there. Look, it is looking at the, the winged creatures on is, what is that? It's the Gargoyle, right? Yeah. Cooley look, fuck that looks, that's wild. He had that made, I mean, it's so obvious that it's his house. He's got a frog also. He loves frogs. The frogs at fuck up mice and shit. Yeah. He's um, you know, I don't think Bangor has a population of 100,000 people. If I had to guess what state? Bangor Maine. That's where he lives. I didn't know as many, what's the population of Bangor? 30 1030 1000 in a city. My buddy was living up there and my friend Marcus Davis was living up there and he loved it. He's a fighter because say there's no crime, there's no crime. It's kind of hard when there's that low of a population. Yeah. He's like, it's really cold up there and shit, but there's no crime. I still gigs up there. I used to gigs up there when I was living in Boston. He drove three and a half hours to Bangor, Maine in the last hour. You have to make sure you get gas because you got to drive an hour with no gas. There's an does that Bangor, that's fright. There is beautiful. The mountain in the lake. God, it's beautiful cotton.

Speaker 1:          02:23:07       Dana white keeps a place up there in Maine. Yeah, yeah. He's got a place in some other part of Maine, like a beautiful, like he's got a big spread up there, a lot of land, and he's like a vacation place where he goes and brings his friends and they just chill. That's it can, I mean, it's interesting. I don't know if that wouldn't be my vacation place spot, but I guess, well, it's fucking beautiful man. And there's no one there and it's gone and they can let you know. I guess you just want to get away from fucking society. You know my vacation spot would be in a lake, Louise and Banff. What's Bam? Bam for national forest is in Calgary. Oh, Lake Louise. You'll probably see them. The prettiest lake I've ever seen in my fucking life. I think it's pretty country up there, dude.

Speaker 1:          02:23:45       Oh Calgary's gorgeous. Fucking beautiful. But Lake Louise in like specifically, I went, I went to Banff national forest when we were doing this thing and I was stunned by how fucking look at that Lake Louise. Ooh Man, that's so pretty. There's some about a mountain and a Lake Combo, right? Mountains in a lake together. It's like fishing. I do like fucking fishing. I love fishing. Don't get to do it enough. I let me needed, that's a problem. But I've been thinking about that lately. Like I need to do more fishing. Like, I see shit like that and I go, God, I don't want to be out there like catching northern pike having a good old fucking time. It's the best way to like hang out with friends and just chill the fuck out and talk shit and have a laugh and, and if you can cook them on the shore, uh, that's the best thing of frying pan and cook it right there.

Speaker 1:          02:24:33       They're so delicious. Like you can't believe how much more delicious they are. Fresh fish is unbeatable. There's no two different plays. So much better. Yeah. Store bought fish. It's just not the same. Yeah, me and the missus caught some Mahima he wants and then we brought it right back to the, uh, to the place in Mexico and they were cooking it at the resort. And I was like, this is the best fish I've ever eaten in my life. I can't believe how good it also circumstantial that you're like, this is one of the greatest kind of ways to have that. So it also probably releases different endorphins in your brain to be like, I'm enjoying this more than I ever would enjoy other fish. But it was the first time I'd ever caught, I would eat and Mahi Mahi that was her super fresh. Like I had eaten it before, but it was probably frozen.

Speaker 1:          02:25:10       You know what I mean? Not that fresh. Maybe a day old pat. Yeah, but when you eat it like an hour after you catch, it's like, Holy Shit. Imagine how salmon tastes the bears. I catch them out of the fucking room or in their office. So excited. They get so fat they get so fucking fat. Coastal bears. That's the big ones. You know, brown bears and grizzly bears are the same thing, but brown bears are way bigger and the reason why they're way bigger, it's because they live on the coast, so just eating fish and dead whales they launched and anything else they can get there. Fuck origin on fucking fatty, fatty, heavy foods. There's an awful video. Awful. Jamie. I'll find it. Of a grizzly that's polling black bear cubs out of a den and killing them and eating them and the mother is trying to stomp them.

Speaker 1:          02:25:54       He's trying to stop the grizzly from eating her babies and he just swats are away like she ain't shit. I got say, it's awful dude, you shouldn't, shouldn't play it. It definitely cannot play it and you shouldn't even watch it. I'm gonna it. The screens that they make and it takes, it's a long ass video and she's trying to fight him off but he's like, fuck you, I'm eating your babies. That's one thing that bothers me the most about the anthropomorphization that people do with animals is the, their stance on bears is, I don't want people to hate bears, but I want people to know what a bear really is versus what they think it is. I think they're sweet. They eat honey and they're sweet and they're nice and they don't really fuck shit up. They, they're amazing. I'm a big fan of bears, but they are all cannibals.

Speaker 1:          02:26:43       They're all cal bears make me feel like, of course there were dinosaurs pairs or like that's just a fucking dinosaur. Well, it's a beast. This is what it is. It's a beast in the purest sense. So any beast make reminds me that we definitely had had to have dinosaurs. That that was just a small dinosaur. No, it's nothing like a dinosaur's far, far, far, far, far creep here, they don't have any hair. I don't trust anything with no hair. You don't have any fucking hair. I have a little, I got out of my face get ugly, but I don't trust anything that like is hairless. Any hair on its body. It's what other animals? What do you mean? Like fish or hairless like a snake. Everything in the waters hair list. You don't trust those fox? None of it. None of it. That bottlenose dolphins I brought back and they just found you don't trust that dolphin and so that's a weapon from Russia.

Speaker 1:          02:27:26       It's awesome. They want to put a bomb on that thing, but we had a Russian strap on. It's back. That's the whole did spoke Russian. It had a Russian strap on its back. Stope like the, the, the whale that they're talking about. They think the Russians had trained it to get close to boats so that it could hit the boat and blow it up. Stope you don't care. I care. Some things are cool. I mean they're rendering of rex hair hair. But I thought they think it has feathers to think those are fair and looking at it has red hair by the way, at the front of its face. Well that's the other thing. They think that it might've been because they think they might been scavengers. T rex was a ginger with freckles. Where did you find this Jamie's holes? Fucking Dick rule that no ginger's that are assholes. How about a Dunn's word? They're all over the place. Changes that are assholes you can't not find. Look at, there's nothing. Might've had facial features like a vulture. They think it might have been red

Speaker 2:          02:28:22       in the face cause they really don't have any idea what the, I mean, when you see these color drawings, they just take chances. They just are all made up. The, um, university of Bozeman, not the University of Bozeman and the natural history museum, and Bozeman, Montana has a raptor that on one side of it, they had feathers on it. So it's hard to give you like an alternate perspective of what it might've looked like. So they had this raptor and in one side of it, it looked just like an, like an evil bird. It's really cool because they, they know now. That's what it looked like. They know now that a lot of dinosaurs had had feathers. They've actually got fossils of dinosaurs with feathers. So they know that the idea that all dinosaurs were these reptile looking things is incorrect. Some of them literally were birds. So the birds that you see today, whether it's a peacock or a chicken or something like that, they're fucking dinosaurs.

Speaker 2:          02:29:17       That's what that is. It's a dinosaur that survived the ones that are bigger than a chicken. It didn't really make it, but the ones, you know, why did the small ones making it will hide that when the impact of the crater hit the world, that it was so devastating. They killed almost everything. Kyla and every, whatever was left, whatever, scrounging, scavenging little creature that was left, evolved and became us. We used to be a mole. We used to be like a shrew 65 million years ago. That's what these people, these, these nonbelievers is what they think you, you think it's ridiculous that you think you came from a monkey to know it's addictive. I know. You know, this is how crazy these liberals are. You know that it's crazy to think you came from monkey. Willie's motherfuckers take it to another level. They, they're so crazy.

Speaker 2:          02:30:02       They think you came from a shrew. He were a lack. A little mole cannot here. Yep, Yep, Yep, Yep, Yep. And then that became a monkey. And then add the monkey becomes you all that shit inside of 65 million years. Get the fuck Outta here. Fuck. Meanwhile, crocodiles are a hundred million years old. So crocodiles are the same. But somehow or another, we went from being a fucking shrew to being a person who knows and loves Jesus and her heart shit. That's it right there. That's that thing. So if you see like rats, like there was a, I don't buy it. I think it was in, where was it? There was a video. We were a science experiment. There was a video of rats in Chinatown. I th I want to say it might've been northern California, but there was, they were tearing down a building in Chinatown and the volume of rats that come pouring out of this building, it's like, hold on, say that Shit. They did what? They were living in the walls of this building, it demolish it and all the rest came out. They were demolishing it and people were outside filming. As you're seeing like streams of rats run out of this building and out onto the street, stumbling into the gutter, standing there on the sidewalk, not knowing where to go and fucking hate rats are running past him, but I mean hundreds of rats, hundreds, probably thousands if they're in the walls. Right? For sure.

Speaker 1:          02:31:20       For sure. Communities are rats inside the rural walls. This building, they're tearing down. I'm glad we don't have rats in Los Angeles. Not like they do in like New York. Do you know why we don't have rats?

Speaker 1:          02:31:31       Cody's, that's right. Yeah. The coyotes. Yeah. Those motherfuckers [inaudible] mark, creepy weird dogs that you see running around taking all the fucking rats. Those who don't quit be cons. They keep us in check. What do you, what did you find Jamie? Do you find the rat video with all the other video about by found like this one lady said she thought she was going to die. There were so many rats around her. She didn't know what to do. Just a little. Just a little much. But it says there was a huge problem in 91 year old building. I can't find a video of your, that's an l like February 9th and they tore it down, I think. Oh Shit. Well, if you're in the city, I'm sure there's horrible rat problems and I know there's rat problems in the Hollywood hills too. Um, yeah, I, yeah, that's your out here.

Speaker 1:          02:32:06       There's no fun. Somebody told me they were at a movie theater and some, some person who lives in the hills had a nice house with a movie theater, but they had to keep their feet up when they watch movies cause rats were running across your feet. Shut the fuck up in their Nice House with a movie theater. Okay, get that shit handled called exterminator. Get that shit handled the or get a, get a couple more dogs. Keep your feet up. Get more dog cats around. When they get shit in a box in your house, just piss in a box. A little dog. Does Marshall or eat little critter things? He does. He bring him into the house. He loves kill squirrels. Would joke around about it. He's a squirrel killer, but he's a straight up squirrel, killer murderer. He's so sweet, but not the squirrels thing is he doesn't rip them apart.

Speaker 1:          02:32:44       He just kills them like they're a toy and he brings him back. I don't think he understands what the fuck they are. No, he doesn't fuck up. But he brings him back and then what does he put them in the same spot. Every time you bring your ball back, they'll drop in this bottle being a squirrel bag drop in this bar. Like they returned things. Yeah, he's a retriever. Well he just wants to know if you want this. No, no, he's a retriever. Yeah, go get, that's what those dogs are. Those dogs are designed probably for like duck hunting or some shit, like whatever, whatever retrieval that you wanted them to do. But they, they're, they don't crush things. They have a gentle mouth. They call it a soft mouth. Like when they carry things they don't like I've had pimples. Right. And they just crush everything.

Speaker 1:          02:33:18       They merge everything you give them. I had a dog that I had to give him a fucking root canal. Not, I did it. I brought him to an actual dentist show the dentist. He, he bits so hard. He shattered his teeth. He shattered his back, his back teeth. Ah, by crushing, um, uh, bones. It just was crushing, just going, since they have so much power that their teeth would crack. But the cold retrievers don't bite that heart. They don't bite. That's like Brittany's, my dad's friend had a Brittany, a hunting dog. Brittanys are like that too. They're gentle and put a duck in their mouth or something, but they won't buy exactly. Like you can't go duck hunting with a pit bull. So bring you back a hamburger patty. Like it happened to duck you fucking asshole. And it's like, Shit, get it shock rip to fucking shreds.

Speaker 1:          02:34:00       Yeah. Do you have, you want a dog? You don't want a German shepherd that does bite work to go out and get your docs, whatever retriever. I mean, it's not a coincidence that those dogs like labs and retrievers, they're like the sweetest dogs in the world. There's so nice to people. Yeah, because it, because they're, I think they're inherently like their whole, they're not a vicious attack. They don't like attacking. I'm, I've never seen a of golden attack, so, no, no, no. They're not like that at all. But they're bred for that and that's the way their bread. Like you, you never met my dog yet. Right. She's the fucking nicest. I, if he's in here, he wouldn't leave you alone. Who usually putting his head in your lap like hello? Like he just, he'll drop to his back all the time. Just come on.

Speaker 1:          02:34:36       Belly rubbed me. Like if he meets you, he'll start whining and he runs around in circles and then he drops his basic rub my belly. Come on in here and you know you went to and he just want love. Constantly want love and hugs. My Day. Every day. I'm not going to lie for a long time. Not having a dog at the house is so strange. And because you said when you come home and not have anything, sometimes it's, it's a little overwhelming. Yeah. It's nice to have something to be like, hey, it's great for lonely people. Oh my God. By herself. It makes a big difference having a dog. Do you criminalize second? What? Wait. It came through. Oh my God. I thought you said it didn't pass this morning and said it didn't it 15 minutes ago. Shit. Denver became the first city in the u s to decriminalize marijuana.

Speaker 1:          02:35:19       Wow. Powerful Denver. Wow. Holy Shit Man. It passed for voters approved measure decriminalized psychedelic mushrooms can. Congratulations. Amazing. How did we think they eat better information? You son of a bitch. They were staying at all night for some reason. They did say son of a bitch. Jamie working with the CIA. Still unofficial apparently though as close to it on Wednesday afternoon, ended up pulling 51 pulled ahead this afternoon. That's why this morning it wasn't a head and then they still, they're still counting votes. The provisions prohibit the city government or using any resources to impose criminal penalties against adults over 21 years of age or personally he's possession of psychosocial seven hey, you don't have to talk about during the end of a commercial. What do you want to do it? You have to get it all out just in case. No, no, no. This is not a discount.

Speaker 1:          02:36:04       What if something hits us and kill somebody knows the fuck you just said. Yeah, it is. That's just the funny thing about those commercials and the flood. A little, little, little, little, little [inaudible] doing it so fast they can't because they just easily get it out legally. It's gray, but it's so gross. Yeah. They just have to get it out. When I first started hearing that, I'm like, there's a job for fast talking bullshitters it's safe like the rapper Mac lethal. Not that he's a fast talker and bullshitter, but he wrapped so fast and uh, do you know he is? Yeah. Dude, he could barely hear half of the shit comes out of his mouth. You can hear it pretty clear. Sometimes pretty fucking clear. Pretty fucking. When he does the wraps in the morning. I've seen some of his shit. Dude, that's a talent. Yeah, that's, I mean the way he does it is incredible.

Speaker 1:          02:36:48       Yeah. He's got dunning. Like I hear it and I just go, I don't even understand how the fuck tongue can move that fast, but it makes sense. Like do you ever do something with your right hand? Like he'd go like this really fast and I'll try it with your left hand. It's like they can't do it all. It's like, yeah, like I can, I can tap this real fast but I can't, I can't really do with my left hand. Exactly. That's tapping is a good example. Yeah. You got to think that your face is like that too, but your mouth, it's got to be quick. You gonna Move Advisor won't Pfizer, Pamela. I went to an auction basically. Hey,

Speaker 2:          02:37:16       otherwise I've got to ride dad. Dad. Keeping up with your face with the noises is that same skill. It's the same way that a buffer brothers were able to do that thing that they're able to do. No, there's something, there's something about it. I know, but there's something about it. Well, there's definitely something about the rhythm that he does. The rhythm that he announces this. It's like, it's so specific that you're like, wow, this is really, it's such a unique talent. Bruce is different than anybody. Anybody that's ever done that kind of shit because he gets fucking crazy. Like he's perfect for MMA. He gets so amped up because most people are just professional in the red corner coming from Los Angeles, California, stitch it up. Joe Schilling, you know what I mean? But Bruce fucking screen, he goes fighting. Yeah. The way he yells. It's so fucking true.

Speaker 2:          02:38:09       Ooh. He gets crazy perfect for MMA. It must amp up the fight are so fucking much they might do when they hear your name, you're just going to be like, and he's almost having a heart attack. If he takes to tend to have a heart attack, Bruce buffer gets to five every fucking show. Look at them there. I mean, he's not dying. He's in great shape, but he gets to halfway to a heart attack every fucking time. Like, look, I'll ready gets bro. I mean you, he's putting it out there. That's why he's so much different than any other ring announcer ever because you can't just do that. Like if you go back and watch his early days, he wasn't really doing it like that. Like she developed his style. Look how cool that is, man. Him and Tj Dillashaw fucking bombed out. Pumped. Is he right there?

Speaker 2:          02:38:58       That's telling you about Bruce buffer pumps people the fuck up, man. Look at that. That's intense, man. That's intense. Whoo. That's so exciting. He's awesome. He said she character too, man. He's perfect suits. He's always got a different one. Yeah, he's always looking. She always looks sharp, sharp as long as it's real fucking shot. But it's interesting that like that style of announcing really didn't exist before Bruce. Right. And before MMA, like it didn't, it was not appropriate for boxing. Like he had this air of old man class kind of still that you had to abide by these rules and they still have a bell thing come out and hit the bell with the thing. Well I mean, I mean w the would clap still happens across the board for, for boxing and MMA. Yes. Yes. Warning. Second warning is still a thing. Yeah. Like how come they have an upgraded that to a sound?

Speaker 2:          02:39:46       I don't understand. What's a good quote? That's a good point because sometimes people get confused. It's happening even with professionals and they misinterpret the would clap as being the end of the round because just cause they're so in the groove right there. Like what happened did that was at the end of the round and they'll stop and the ref go now I'll keep going and you have 10 seconds left. And then like sometimes weird stuff happens where guys get out of their mental pattern. Sure. It's happened many times. It's got to also be the noise of an arena sometimes can take over. I'm sure something gets distracted here that you think, was that a yell or was that the clap? Like do

Speaker 1:          02:40:14       I have 10 seconds left her dewine so we're going to be in Chicago for that big fight. Fucking oh shit was going to be fine. What does that, June, what does that, what does June 8th right? June 8th. Right now I don't, I don't think there's any tickets left if anybody wants. No, I doubt it pretty close. But there's a, that's a big UFC card too, isn't it? Who's on that car? Uh, I just saw this morning, I just looked this morning, Henry Cejudo versus Marlin Mariah's for the bantamweight title. Ooh. She has the opportunity to become champ champ. And then I'm Ma Marlin rise. Fucking fantastic fighter. Yeah, that's a great card. Jimmy Rivera. Petra Yawn. Yawn. Pyotr I think it's just, we'll say the pure to pure Tra fuel truck, Russian character. Valentina Shevchenko versus Jessica. I, that's great. Fight to, um, that's such a great name. So chanko yeah. Such a great fucking Badass.

Speaker 1:          02:41:12       I fuck you up. Name that. Hold on. Stop scrolling back up. It's Tatiana Suarez is a B stew. That woman is so good. She's probably the best wrestler in female MMA. She smashes people and need an Sar off is fantastic. That's a great fight. That's um, Amanda Nunez. His girlfriend too. Amanda Nunez is probably the baddest woman. Literally ever. Oh, we met her, right? Yeah, she was at the last, she's the one that knocked out. Cyborg. Cyborg was the baddest woman in MMA when Amanda Knew Nunez starched her in the first round. There's no one you could literally legitimately give that title too. It's Amanda Nunez. She's the baddest woman ever. Aljamain sterling versus page on Munoz. That's a gray card. Ricardo Lamas. Calvin or that's a great fight to shit. A lot of, a lot of chicks. A lot of checks be fighting. A lot of Chicago girls. It's not Chicago girls angry for getting ready to fly.

Speaker 1:          02:42:07       Tamp fucking tie into this town. That's you guys. That's Boston. Chicago girls are more, I don't know how to say the Chicago. Chicago's no, fuck a talented. He's Tan. Kiss my ass. I'll fuck you up drill. Say That I ass. Yeah. Fuck you. Chicago is an interesting combination with like Midwest and urban, like it's a city. It's like, it's like cosmopolitan. It's sophisticated, but it's also the city in the Midwest. That's what it is. It wouldn't be. Yeah, that's right in the middle of fucking Ohio Turd. So they get so jealous when we say that Columbus has an argument that it might be better than Chicago. No other city in the Midwest has an argument that a lot of people that that's like where you would graduate from if you've got tired or too big for Columbus and he move over to see how far you drive.

Speaker 1:          02:42:52       Six hours. It's not bad to make it to San Francisco. Yeah. It's not bad at all. But all the cities in the Midwest compete with Chicago and they all know. They fucking know. I mean, it was who would be, who would beat us? Who'd be better? Detroit, Kansas City, St Louis. Detroit's in a bad spot. Indianapolis. None of these places have the things that we have. Don't kick Detroit while it's down. No, no. I like to try to what you're doing, I them, they're just not as much tone. Their industry fell apart and Chicago, Milwaukee, I mean all these other cities, they're great cities, but I'm not Chicago. Really crazy is that Detroit in the 1950s was the richest city in the world. Sure. World. Yeah. It's a lot of wealth up. They're getting so many people in the automotive industry. Well, that time when they were at the top of the automotive industry and they were making cars that were coveted throughout the world and all the manufacturing was done there, she wasn't the richest city in the world at one point in time.

Speaker 1:          02:43:42       Now it's one of the poorest. It's less than a century later. It's really crazy. There's not another city like that that hasn't had like some sort of a catastrophe, like something hit it like it just went away. Yep. Detroit as, I mean I, it's actually a wonderful fucking city. I actually do love to try it. It is really sad. Yeah. It's sad. When you go up there cause you, you see remnants of what was, it's really strange to see what, what happened with GM and all that shit. You could buy a house for $100 that's not funny. Now you can kind of a bitch. Why you laughing? You must be, don't tell me jokes person. I think it's funny that you could buy a house when you, while you can't buy a house out here for fucking, you can't even buy a house for a hundred grand. Nope. Not even people.

Speaker 1:          02:44:25       We tell people that like you can't buy a house for $100,000 it's like, no, you can't. And impossible. I think a what? Impossible. Like if you live in Sugarland, Texas, you can get a pretty decent house for like 150 grand, like Nice House. Not here. Not Fuck that. Not even close people. What's the what? What is it like in Ohio cheap looking on Detroit. Zillow. This is $1,000. It's foreclosed though. Thousand Bucks. It's nice house. Let's go there and start a podcast studio, our next podcast, studio downstream match. And if we just decided to do that, we decided to armor plate a fucking house. Have a guard there, 24, seven and helicopter in. We'll fly in brow this regular flights to Detroit, and then we have a Detroit version of our podcast and kind of fun, but we have to wheel in our electronics or they'll try to steal it.

Speaker 1:          02:45:10       Yeah, I mean that's just not smart. Detroit is like too dangerous. We have to go somewhere more rural, but also ridiculous. Can we go main? Yeah. Main Bank. Gorman far out. Oh, come on, bro. Don't be scared, man. C'Mon. Let's go somewhere close. We'd get all those cool people from northern California. Let's go up to like, uh, like, like, like, like Napas area. Like, hmm. Okay. Well let's go. But that plays burns every couple of years. Bad. Yeah, I guess it does. Yeah. What about, okay, well what, what by the ocean? We'll do like Carmel, Carmel by the sea. You tuffle C'mon. Let's see. Hormel's gorgeous. I like how you're talking. That's where Clint Eastwood film play misty for me. That's where he lives, right? Well, he was the mayor of Carmel. Oh Shit. He won your mayor. Can't it can't stop that guy. Why aren't we going where the mushrooms illegal? Oh, too many people to move in in Denver, man. Too many people, too many people are moving with that. Look it up. Look it up about Denver's problem with their infrastructure. They're hating how many people are coming into their city. Listen Bro, you moved to evergreen live in the mountains. Savage. I'll move to Breck Elvis album to breakfast.

Speaker 2:          02:46:10       How about Aspen? That's a rich. When he coke Breckenridge is nice. I like Breck. Don't you want to see y'all girls yelled or boyfriends and scream out in this treat with naked is we need more money. Is the mushroom legality, is that going to be like a doctor thing? Are they going to like, no, it's deep. Criminalized is, is that you don't go to go. You don't go to jail but you can't sell it legally. It's very squirrely but it's what it is is step one and that's what we need. We need step one and then it's also on the ballot in California soon. And when it's on the ballot in California, soon it has a likelier chance here. I think that even in Denver and more so now the real problem is people don't understand what it is. Right. And they think it's just like, oh my God, these kids going to do mushrooms are gonna drive off cliffs.

Speaker 2:          02:46:59       That's what people worry about. You can do more testing now. Right? Is that sort of what it helps? Well, they've done some tasks. Johns Hopkins University had some pretty extensive testing that they did that showed, um, real positive results with people that had terminal illnesses where it alleviated the worry of death. And um, there was some other studies that had been run on it, but there's so far no one has ever instituted in the United States at least like a real thorough, comprehensive clinic where you can go and they can treat you if you have alcohol addiction, Ptsd. There's a lot of different things they could treat with psilocybin. And it's been illegal because it's a schedule one substance. So all these people, it's one of the best things on earth to fix, like mental barriers and problems that you have, especially if it was done in a controlled clinical environment by people you trusted and you felt safe.

Speaker 2:          02:47:55       And that's what a shaman is supposed to be, right? What a shaman is supposed to be. So many provides you with the psychedelic substances in a controlled state with they, they let you be in a good state of mind set and setting is always very, very important. And if we could do that, I mean I really think we have a real good chance of turning a lot of people around. People that are addicted to things, people with psychological problems, people that can't see themselves should have a lot of, lot of different issues. And it's one of the best tools for that. But like every tool, it could be abused, but the problem is not the tool. The problem is abused, whether it's with alcohol or pills or food or any of these things. We're talking about sex. People can abuse anything of course, but it doesn't mean that silicide and isn't in an amazing compound that literally can change humanity. It can.

Speaker 3:          02:48:43       Yeah, it has. It has. It does. And there's so many other, there are so many other things that we don't even know. We haven't even tapped into the possibilities. That's the other thing was when you limit yourself on the possibilities, it's like, well, we don't, how do we know what happens? How do you know what it's going to do? What if the chip releases mushroom juice every 15 minutes? A little micro dose. Just a little micro dose. No, it feels your levels when you start getting angry. When they got cuts me off and I'm like, you fucking asshole releases and I'm

Speaker 1:          02:49:07       like, a little bit of God juice. I'm fine. You are fine. Aren't you going somewhere this weekend? Were you at when Vegas? Oh Jesus. Would he do in Vegas?

We start to fucking slowly, slowly turn into machining. You, you, you can read minds for the first 10 years, Denny, get Parkinson's. Fuck sacrifice dude. You thinking in 10 years I'll fix it.

Speaker 1:          02:50:41       I'll fix it by then. 10 years. We do that all the time. It's not a cure by the time that we're done with it. I've seen people say that about cigarettes. I think, you know, I wish I didn't have to smoke, but I do. And I'm thinking they're going to fix it. They're going to fix it with medics, mate. I've got to fix it with Madison about Jules. What about these electronic cigarettes? That's next close. They're so close to being able to reverse cancer by the time I get cancer, my mother, I dunno, my mother's going to die from cancer, but maybe not me. Not me, not me, bro. All these other younger generation does suck and not the electronic. The robot. Dick's. I think that's going to kill him. I Dunno. That's going to, I think there's gonna be some shit in there. Did you pens?

Speaker 1:          02:51:20       Fuck yeah, thanks. How do you know what's in those you ask and they'll tell you. Why are they lying to you then why would they tell you? Cause you're so stupid. You're willing to smoke a robot. Did they tell you the truth of what's in there? You think they're going to keep selling them? They could sell them. They had skulls and crossbones on it with a, with a person with x's for eyes. Like right there. Like people die from this. This, yeah. Choke to death. Cigarettes like cigarettes in Europe, they have the packet they had, they've show pictures of people with like lung cancer. Oh this happens. People at giant warnings not telling me. Oh. Fark Foskett keeps smoking. Did you ever smoke when you were young? No, I tried it. I tried it when I was 15 me and my sister tried it. She kept smoking. She smoked for years and now she's quit. She quit. Eventually she quit when she had kids. What about, what about a robot?

Speaker 2:          02:52:06       Cigars. You never smoked cigars? Yeah, I like cigars. I smoke cigars. Yeah. I used to have some here, but I don't want anymore and none of them. Well now they have weed in them. Yeah. It wasn't my favorite sectors. It's a different thing like the cigar with no weed is like that speedy kinda relax. See, weird high. People don't know. If you don't smoke cigars, you get high. This is why like Republicans who are anti-drug, who smokes cigars and like whiskey, shut your dirty mouth. You're on drugs. Okay, they, these are, you're on a substance. Yeah. You're, you're altering your state of consciousness. With cigars, they give you a certain amount of euphoria. Nicotine, you get that little buzz from the high, like I used to smoke cigars all the time with Kevin James. Kevin James doesn't fuck with weed. He doesn't really drink, but he will smoke the shit out some cigars and we got fucked up.

Speaker 2:          02:52:53       They fuck you up. They do. They do in a weird way or over that, that it's, it's overwhelming. There are a lot. They're heavy. It's a lie. You just want to kind of like, I'd like him after a fat steak and I want to feel like an ugly American of a fat Ribeye and then a fucking cube and sit on a porch and just talk shit with your friends. You know have a glass of whiskey. Yeah and that's a like a non self aware high. Like sometimes you don't want to be, you don't want to be like not even self awareness is the wrong term when a really looking for is like self analysis. You're not an analyzing yourself and you smoking a cigar and drinking whiskey. You have fun. Yeah. Just hanging a comeback kicking back and your brain's not, your brain's kind of turned off and you do those things.

Speaker 2:          02:53:39       It's not turned on like the, the problem with the weed is all the good things about the weed. The weed is good because it makes you think and it makes you paranoid. It makes you aware and yeah, he makes you more compassionate. It makes you more contemplatives and makes you more self analytical. But it also could freak out sometimes and maybe that's not what you want that day. Maybe that day you just want to Hoyle de Monterrey double corona. Just puff on that bad boy. You ever inhale? Look now at glass of Buffalo. Trace with a big fucking ice cube. I swear to you Peshy when a big fucking nice big fat. Whenever we go and get drinks. Andrew Santino asks, how big are your ice cube? This? We asked like a whiskey, but you have a, do you have a large queue of one stone and I always look away like this motherfucker and aids.

Speaker 2:          02:54:31       I said, do you have one stone? I just want one stone. So high maintenance. He wants a large ball. It got a ball. Can you get me a nice ball? Yeah, with the fur balls of ice because you know what they do. Otherwise they scoop a fuck load of ice in there and it dilutes the whiskey and it's all water. I don't like it. No. My friend John Dudley does, it wasn't play games. He takes a pan of water, like a large pan, and then he puts it in the trade or grills and he sets it to super smoke and the smoke is constantly pumping into the water. It leaves it there for hours. Then he takes that smoke filled water and he pours it into those

Speaker 1:          02:55:03       ball. So he makes those molds with smoke infused water. I love him. Then he puts dat in the glass and the Whiskey, he knows and I'm like, Whoa, that's next level. And like that shit smoked. It smoked and you gotta break up. You're supposed to break those bottles on hand. Yeah. Who is it? WHO's out there doing that? What does that, oh, that's the wedge. I've seen this. Yeah. What is this? Communism. What does it it? It's half ice. Half glass. Get that shit out of my face. God Damn hippies. Fucking hippies. What else? You got your own cold brew. Ha. Yeah. Homemade. That's like, go to see if you could find you want to be, prove your wizardry skills cause I know he has them. Yeah. Try to find John Dudley smoked ice balls on the Instagram. Good luck. He'll find it. He'll find it within sex.

Speaker 1:          02:55:53       Rager smoke balls. He calls him smokey balls. So he makes him doesn't himself. Yeah, he makes it doesn't himself like in his backyard. And he started already got I got, I got to bring it up to see if it makes sense. I can't, if he gave me time, I wouldn't be able to convince her if I can't do that shit. He was doing it while he's operating the camera. So here's John's, uh, he's going to grill running. So he's got that, that pan fill with water. There is smoke in it. Yeah. And, and this is a, he's got the insulated top on it because he's in Iowa. It's freezing fucking cold. And then he pours that smokey water into the molds. Dun, Dun, Dun. Okay. Balls trying to give fucked up kids. Ooh. Smoky balls, Cat Lady. That crazy shit. So yeah, that was when we were in Lanai when we were little.

Speaker 1:          02:56:46       And I, John, John and I have, we've tied it on, man. We've tied it on many times, but we did one podcast with a bunch of bow hunters and we got fucked up. We're drinking everything in the mini cabinet and a w the minibar had red bull and red wine and Tequila and a, what else? Die Coke and John Dudley mix it all up and call it a cat lady. Cause just like some crazy shit fucked up. And we were all drinking. I had no, there was no diet coke. It was red bull Tequila and red wine. That's what it was. It was the damn delicious. What are so trashy? I was going to say when we were high as fuck and we're just trashed trying to go to your fucked up. The kids who do the suicide, you know that every, every fucking kind of soda and the machine.

Speaker 1:          02:57:33       It's only good because you're like, Eh, this is supposed to be fun. We were just having a good time doing a podcast, you know, having a good time. Just drinking ridiculous shit. Bullshit. Yeah, the Cat Lady, it's going to be a thing because now the internet is gonna be like, well, I want to make a cab was a thing for a while. People were doing it, but then they realize why would you do that when you could have a Margarita or have a peer that actually raised him on their own? Yeah. Have a nice glass of wine by itself. It's just some shit you do when you're, you know, you're scratching your and scavenging and a mini bar. Whenever you get bored in high, you create like the most, I saw someone on the Internet posted. They took the ice cream from an ice cream sandwich and then rice to Rice Krispie treats and they put the ice cream between is it was an ice crispy treat.

Speaker 1:          02:58:14       Someone wants them for diabetes. Aubrey, I think we can go with the Burrito that like ice cream burrito. It's going around. I seen that candy and ice cream and shit. That shit's gross. Cub Swanson turned a double double from in and out into a Taco. What? Yeah. He chopped up a double double and put it into a taco shell asked from me to remember us talking about it, whether or not that's okay. Blasphemy. You can't fuck with it in and out. Push things along. God, how was that Shit? Taco Bell. Fucking gross. Gross. Well foul. Anybody that eats Taco bell living in Los Angeles, a shameful human being. The amount of good Mexican food just so it's like it's too much. There's too much good. What is happening here? Turn 200 McDonald's burgers into a Burrito. Yeah, this guy, the mealtime guys, they've been doing this for a while.

Speaker 1:          02:59:02       I've been doing this for 10 years. They stuff it in there. And what is the wrap? Is that a Burrito wrap and then Kevin need to see this. Jamie. Jamie, I want to look at your search engine. I would take away your right to vote. I'd be like, there's no way. Like at different computers. What's wrong with you? That's why it got different. That's why I got different computers. You don't see my other ones, Dan, you. I don't know why anybody now I have different emails. This is Mr. Happy Easter. Happy Lines to get on. This one only looks for happy things. Flowers, different personality for different computers. This is Mr Dirty. This is what I really like. I like the best organic fertilizer. It just hurt the environment.

Speaker 1:          02:59:41       You live in La. Where would you live? And if we, we all moved together, where should we go to questions either. Well, it's gotta be somewhere where there's no state income tax because you're tired of this shit. Tired of this bullshit. But what if you start making more money? You don't give a fuck anymore. But still it's kind of like, why am I paying any more money to the fucking, so plenty of homeless people around. Okay. All right, fine. Someone's going to fix the streets too. Are they? When are they going to start? It looks good. That's why a lot of athletes operate out of Florida. I drove here today and it didn't bother me at all. Yeah, you live so close to here. I live on the roof live in Florida because of low income tenants. Say operational business out of this is why Oj is, they're like, they can't get you if you owe money.

Speaker 1:          03:00:26       Florida kick at you. Yeah. You can hide in Florida if you owe money. Really? Yeah. Yeah. It's one of them weird ones, so I've trumped nationals down there. Well, I think that's like pensions and shit. Like they can't take away your pensions. Right? They probably have some weird like union restriction law that they can't touch your stuff. I think. I don't really, I don't know if I could live in Florida, but yeah, you could. Yeah, you would just mock it. Me and oatmeal and John Travolta and he lives in a collar one right next door to him. He always offer massages and shit and he'd be like, Nah, I'm good. You want to jump on a plane? Fly To dance together. You and me just fly. Fuck. I don't know man. John Travolta wants to be my friend. Do you think he's just wants to be my friend?

Speaker 1:          03:01:01       He just said, buddy, he's a good guy. He's got a [inaudible]. Oh No, we have to land in the water. We'll have to hold each other for warmth for awhile. Oh, how long for like four days. Maybe fall inside you and keep you warm or from the inside by Dixon your ass. They might come rescue me as turns. Very hot. I know that sounds crazy, but it's a, it's a different change of life and death. Got to put it inside. If you put your mouth on my penis, it, it heals. You'll see. It's like over a hundred degree. Blow me up and then ride me as we float away, blowing me up like a balloon.

Speaker 3:          03:01:31       His playground scenario or Volta. I don't know where I would live probably. I mean Chicago is an easy answer. I really want to move back to Chicago. I love it. You don't mind the winters, you bond something about the bonding that happens in the winter in Chicago. I believe that too. You have like a cultural bond with people. Man. There's nothing better than going to a bar in the winter in Chicago and it's fucking gross and sad and cold outside and everyone is having a good time. Everyone wants to read together in these moments.

Speaker 1:          03:01:54       It's true, but you don't want to live in the south side where the bullets are going off left. And Ryan, I'll let you know nowhere near this. How do they stop that? I was talking to a guy who was a cop and he was telling me that it's a, they arrested certain gang members, like certain people that are running the gangs, gang leaders and they created a power vacuum and then they start fighting. Then it got even more chaos.

Speaker 3:          03:02:15       It got way worse. But at the cops have tried to work with gangs over the years in a million different ways to try to like curb the violence. They did it here in Los Angeles. How'd they do it? They have these people, they have these people that are like these community organizers who like run the neighborhood and they have these like kind of peace talks with these gang leaders to tell them like certain ways to operate in within the community because they're like, your kids live here, you're with your girlfriends. So it it for some reason I think there's been a lot of weird cultural movements in La, uh, that have helped. Like, you know, Nipsey, uh, Nipsey Hussle got shot and I think all these crips showed up with blood and other people came together. I think it was this weird coming together of gangs and this has happened in La a few different times or community organizers kind of started like peel back these walls of like, we also have to live here. I know you want to function as an organization, but I think Chicago is reckless. I don't think it's, I think it's less about gangs in Chicago. It's more about young people with guns who want control and I don't think they're all parts of gangs. I just think this is, it's a, it's a violent city. It's an angry violence that it's a lot of, a lot of poverty, a lot of poverty.

Speaker 1:          03:03:25       And you live there most of your life. So what, what's the consensus thinking of how to fix it?

Speaker 3:          03:03:34       I don't know, man. I wish. I wish I had like a, I wish I felt like I knew what would help that kind of stuff. But I'm just a fucking white guy from the north side. You know like the majority of these people are black. The majority of the south side is black and the majority of the violence and the crime that happens in that community is driven around these pockets of the south side. I have no relatability. That's the problem. Right, but what did they think is the way to fix it? Shit, I don't fucking know. Look, if you are the king of the world, what would you do to fix the crime and south side for the last thing that we talk about on this podcast, I would do if it was me, if I was trying, if I really tried to think world president puts him, puts him Tino.

Speaker 3:          03:04:10       If I could put some more money in there and get some programs in there, start helping people. I don't know what it is. I don't know what the specific thing and typical liberal you think it's going to be fixing and money. These motherfuckers and they wonder why Trump won. Well they always say like [inaudible] gonna take away the guns. Never gonna take away the guns. It's never going to work. You've got to make some kind of program that helps people function. I don't know what it is. I'm not that smart. I'm not that smart. But I do think there's, I do think there's a way to fix it, but I do think there's also a lot of young kids who would get guns in Chicago and they kill people. Uh, it's going to be a slow process of change forever. Obama couldn't do shit. A lot of them from Chicago, a lot of those community organizers in Chicago were mad at him cause he didn't fix anything because people in the black community where like you promised you would fucking help a little bit. And then it, look, this is the first year I think we've had a dip in murders in Chicago and we're coming up on the summer. So we'll see the summer's party telling a few Yvonne bit. We'll see. We'll say. We'll say people got guns, man,

Speaker 2:          03:05:06       you Santina let's wrap this bitch up. Bring it home. Cheeto Santino on the Instagram and on the Twitter. Andrew Santina, [inaudible] dot com that's my website. That's your mother fucking website. Come see me. We'll be in Los Vegas this weekend at Jimmy Kimmel's, comedy club

Speaker 3:          03:05:23       sisters,

I'm saying into week in Vegas and then the next weekend and then the following and we're in Chicago. Let and bitches know. All right. That's going to be fun as fuck. Good bye everybody. Until we meet again.

Speaker 4:          03:05:43       Jamie, you pulled up some of those.
