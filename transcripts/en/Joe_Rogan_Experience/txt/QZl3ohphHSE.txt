Speaker 1:          00:00:08       The Joe Rogan experience, Joe Rogan podcast by night all day.

Speaker 1:          00:00:17       Right? We're live. We can't hear ourselves because Brian Cox, even though he's a musician, he goes, no headphone where we can still hear us. I can hear you. You're right. I just can't hear whether or not, but we wouldn't know. Anyway. What would we do? He knows he's got headphones on. You're right. This is revolutionary from now on. No more headphones. It's ridiculous. What would you use them for? Well, it's like watching television while you're on television. It's like if you were on TV and you were watching a video monitor, it seems weird. Yeah, it's a little redundant. I think we should leave. Cast them aside. Yeah, let's just a revolutionary act. Push them. Push them away. Like not just put them down. Push them away. We reject you. Oh, headphones. We reject you. Amazing technology. Infinite monkey cage. Yeah. What's going on, man? What is this?

Speaker 1:          00:01:03       First of all, I'm a huge fan of your work. I said that when he came in, but I have to tell people online. This is a huge treat for me. I'm very excited. Space has been my all time adult freak out. Pleasure. I love watching space documentaries. I love watching television shows on space. So having you in here is a huge treat. Thank you. What's infinite monkey cage? It's a long running now, a BBC radio show. So the idea initially was to get scientists to talk about their science, whatever it may be. You said cosmology or archeology? Human origins, mathematics, everything. And then I do it with a standup comedian called Robin Inns. It's very good friend of mine and we always also invite another guest who will be a comedian sometimes or an actor or someone who will kind of ask those questions that come in from left field and.

Speaker 1:          00:01:53       But it always goes off into some as as your podcast do it just, you never know where it's going to go. So we're gonna call it a front of a live audience, usually London and we record for about two hours, usually in broadcast every about 30 minutes and as a podcast as well, which is a bit longer, but we decided to bring it to the states because there are lots of scientists in the states, lots of comedians and people like yourself that you're going to do it with us in three weeks in their wealth of Thursday, the twelfth in La and so we just want it. So we're going to record them for the BBC and they're going to be on the podcast and broadcast in the UK but also in front of a live audience. So it's a. someone asked me this morning actually, and I said, it's kind of like a variety show that you had an accent.

Speaker 1:          00:02:32       Do you have those in the states? They said yeah, we used to have them. We used to happen the and used to do one. So I said, well it's kind of like Dave Dimartino had a phd and he would have. It would have been that black and white, a bit of singing and dancing, bit of quantum mechanics basically. That's one of the things that's so important about what you do, what Neil degrasse Tyson does is that you guys, you, you, you were entertaining as well as having a genuine passion and a deep knowledge of science. So it's not just like here's the cold hard facts, which are amazing and fascinating on their own, but you guys both have this way of sort of germinating these ideas into people's minds that might not ordinarily accept them because, uh, there's a lot of people in America especially that associate learning with boring.

Speaker 1:          00:03:20       Well, I think the, the important point series point science is too important not to be part of popular culture. So if we. Popular Culture is the thing that people discuss. So if we seed that to talent shows or sports or whatever it is, then we're removing the most important area of human endeavor out of general conversation. So I think there's a very, there's a responsibility on scientists to say, well, I accept that. Of course, I can't talk at the level that I let you out at a as an undergraduate lecture course at university or even a Postgrad, electrical, so the level of my thesis and my research, I can't do that, but it's extremely important that we don't just see all the ground. We don't want people in in bars tonight or wherever in restaurants to only talk to be talking about the grammys last night. We like them to be talking about the fact that the universe may be infinite in extent that asking questions such as how many civilizations other in the Milky Way Galaxy, the question, the answer might be not very many.

Speaker 1:          00:04:22       If that's true, then what does that mean for the way that we behave? These are important questions, but they will never be debated it unless we take the time and and make the effort to to, to make the science and the ideas and the debate around them. Part of popular culture, the Internet has also opened up a lot of people's ideas about what science can be and also it opened up a lot of people's ideas about the actual popularity of science because there's, until, you know, maybe 10, 20 years ago with the notable exception of like maybe Carl Sagan and a few other famous people that became famous for, you know, uh, either cosmologists are mathematicians. It's very, very rare. But now you're seeing guys like yourself, guys like Neil degrasse Tyson. It's like more and more Richard Dawkins, Christopher Hitchens, while he's alive, these interesting intellectuals become much more mainstream.

Speaker 1:          00:05:17       They become a. because people realized it wasn't that folks weren't interested in these subjects before it was this. They really weren't being presented them. If you don't get enough ratings, if you put your show on Thursday night at 8:00 PM and you don't get x amount of number of people watching, the studio loses interest. The people that produce it start looking at other jobs. I, well, this one wasn't going to work and they start moving on. And that's just the reality of television. And I think that with the Internet, people are able to look at some of these subjects and, and you know, someone will send out a tweet or a facebook link or something like that, and then you'll say, well, this got a million people to look at it over the last 12 weeks. And the, this has

Speaker 2:          00:05:58       sort of, instead of having this immediate timeframe where everybody has to pay attention or the show dies, now ideas are allowed to sort of grow. Yeah, I think you're absolutely right about that. I think we as a culture underestimate people. I think this is what you found with your podcast. I think that there are millions of people out there who are interested in ideas interested in the latest things we found out about the universe and nature and the way that it works. Um, and they'll, they'll come to it. You can, you build an audience, I suppose, and it's very important for the reasons that I outlined our civilization, Carl Sagan, I always used to say that our civilization is based on science and technology. And so in democracies, if your democracy is going to function properly, then people need to know about the cutting edge discoveries and the things that we found out which form the basis of our civilization.

Speaker 2:          00:06:51       Otherwise, how can your democracy function properly. So that's partly the responsibility of the education system of course, but I see actually the media on the Internet and actually on television and radio as part of the education system now I know that the media doesn't see itself as that often exceeds itself as a a corporate effort to generate money for shareholders that I. I'd criticize that quite strongly actually, and we were fortunate in Britain that we've got the BBC whose job it is to be part of the education system. In part it's, it's. It is a national institution. So having a strong public service broadcaster I think is is one of the best things you can do as a country. I mean, imagine a American. I know it will be an anathema to the big corporations who run the TV channels, but imagine you had a channel which which really had a lot of money to BBC is well funded that everybody contributed to in the states whose job was to act in the interests of the nation, whose job it was to say, well, we're going to put these.

Speaker 2:          00:07:52       We're going to make these big signs documentaries and put them on, and yet we'll make entertainment shows and drama shows as well. We're going to make them because we think people need to know this stuff. We want to infuse the next generation of scientists and engineers. That's. That's important actually. It's important not to expose people continually to, to, you know, drivel basically populists driven because people. I think you're right. People want to think, I really believed that people are interested. I rarely go into a bar or a restaurant or a party and people say, what do you do? And anybody say, well, I work at the large Hadron collider at cern in Geneva. We recreate the conditions that were present less than a billion two the second after the big bang. It's very rare that someone just says whatever and it goes until somebody else they're interested. Sure. So I, uh, yeah, I think the, and maybe you're right, the optimistic view as you say, is that the, the, the Internet, we'll remove this culprit layer of middle management in a way this kind of the television executive, but maybe if you can remove that filter. She's like, I thought

Speaker 1:          00:08:56       the malfunctioning kidney in the flow of information, maybe it, it, it's a, it's a good thing in a way it is, uh, it's, it's really kind of an archaic idea. The idea that you know, at, you know, Thursday night at 8:00, that's when the show airs, airs for an hour. Well now you could of course dvr things and you can, of course there's a lot of television shows up, things on demand, so you can download them later. But I think that that's the model, the model is the distribution through the internet and this idea of sending things through the satellites and all the way they're doing it now with television networks, it's like it's. It's not gonna work, it's not gonna last, as soon as companies like Netflix and now Amazon is creating their own television shows as well. There are Internet based companies and they truly understand what the Internet is all about and when Amazon or rather when Netflix releases a series, they released the entire series who can download like all 10 episodes, you can binge watch them, which is a great way to get people hooked on shows as well.

Speaker 1:          00:09:56       This idea that the only way you're going to watch something is if it's on NBC or CBS or ABC and then those people that run those networks, they're in a panic because they got to get people to watch. So they'll throw on some reality show. But housewives that are fighting to the death and people tune in. I mean this is I hosted fear factor. You know, I, I understand what they're doing. I was a part of the problem or part of the solution, if that's what you wanted to watch on television, you know, the, they're just trying to get by, like they're just trying to figure out what's the next American idol, what's the next, you know, whatever. Show the voice, like what do I have to do to get 18 million people who sit in front and watch a ball being passed from one man to the other and they try to get across the line and everybody goes crazy.

Speaker 1:          00:10:37       This, this idea that that's the only way we can get our information. The only way you're going to get entertainment or any, anything that's coming at you that's being produced and created, that's dead. They. What I find interesting about this debate there is it, the media is obviously tremendously powerful. Obviously they, they interface between most people and ideas. Um, and so I worry about, uh, the, the increase of choice in a sense. So it's a very good thing in some respects, but in other respects that you can get to eyes, audiences, audiences will become, get to. Yes. So let's say that for example, I am interested in playing computer games, so, so as a, as a 17 year old something interview, if that's what you're into, you can just watch that 24 slash seven you just so you're not exposed to new ideas. So I would say is that choice really the choice is really what you mean is enfolding choice. So you mean well here, here's the spread of ideas that our culture has generated over you no more than 3000 years of civilization and you, you will stumble across things you didn't know about. Maybe you become interested in ancient Egypt. Maybe it could become interested in the, the, the evolution of Homo Sapiens, the Rift Valley 200,000

Speaker 2:          00:11:54       years ago. Maybe you find that fascinating, but it, if you're not exposed to those ideas, oh, and culture has no way of exposing you to those ideas beyond the education system. Then we were in a. We have a problem. So I, I don't know what the solution is to this, but I think that there's, there's a, there's something to be said. It will never come back now. But the old fashioned model that we had in Britain for many years, where the BBC was really quite dominant, was that you could almost, you could say, well, we're going to put x factor on, let's say, or dancing with the stars or whatever that thing is. And then after we're going to put a documentary on about astronomy and the idea is that some of that, the people who were watching the talent show it will drift into the documentary guy I didn't know I was interested in the moon of Jupiter called Europa as an ocean surrounding it. They may have life on it. I didn't know that. I didn't know I was interested and that that model works. So you're right though, it's gone. Probably. So I think the great challenge is how do you, how do you expose people to new ideas in our culture? How do you get debates going? How do you stimulate that kind of excitement about knowledge in this new media world? Maybe you know,

Speaker 3:          00:13:01       but you're sort of an evangelist in that sense. Then you're. I don't mean it in in a religious way. I mean, you're, you're someone who evangelizes about the ideas of science and of space like you think it's very important to spread these ideas and that 17 year old kid who watched his video games all day, which easily could've been me, that that kid will never break out of that mold. I think that the. I think the 17 year old kid, if he wants to, if he really is completely obsessed and he wants to watch video games all day, the only thing that's going to fix that is just going to eventually get bored and he's going to want to try something new and having the infinite options that are available today. Someone could send him a text. Dude, three words. Infinite monkey cage. Yeah, Google it and the guy, he'll be right.

Speaker 3:          00:13:44       Shit, I'm bored with video games and then he'll have access to all kinds of shit that like if he was just waiting for the BBC to spoon feed him, he's never going to do it. Also, I think that having the stupid shows that we have here in America, like if you watch reality shows, one of the things that you'll notice is the anger that people have about these shows, the anger that to being forced fed this fucking stupid shit, but they're still watching it. That anger sometimes that, that, that rejection of it almost in your soul forces people to go explore other ideas or it inspires people to go explore other ideas. Interesting muddle, isn't it? Frustrate the to deploy. Just suddenly get so angry about the Ama Guide, soul crushing. It was the building this culture that you go seek out knowledge. Maybe that there's something to it, man, because one time I was in my hotel room and I was watching keeping up with the Kardashians and uh, you know, look, it was in between shows like, you know, just flipping through the channels and it was on and it was like, I'm shopping and I can't find what I want to get.

Speaker 3:          00:14:56       This is so frustrating and my sister won't stop bothering me. And they're like texting each other and it's so fucking mind numbing. And somehow or another I'm sucked into it like it's a tornado and it's carrying away up into the sky and then I changed the next channel and it's some biology thing on crocodiles and it's instantly fascinating and it's these people that live on denial and this scientist who's down there and he's studying these crocodiles and you know, there's the villagers who are worried about these things eating them. And then I'm thinking, wow, this is so fucking fascinating. These people are living next to dinosaurs. I mean they have a real issue with dinosaurs eating their family like. Or You could watch these just simple apes talk about shiny things and they'll talk about shiny things and millions of fucking people do, but that the, the anger of can't take this anymore.

Speaker 3:          00:15:49       And then you switched the channel or go online. I really think that does. There's a yin and a Yang to the world, the strongest case for the cadets that compresses your very soul and existence into such a small space that you out into a world of ideas. So that that's what's analogous to California. Because in California we have too much sun. We have so much sun that it doesn't rain. We need 11 trillion gallons of water just to make up for the water that didn't rain in the last three years. It's a fucking disaster, but if you lived in a place like Alaska in the winter where there's no fucking son at all and just looking for little peaks in the clouds or those those days in Portland where it's just 39 days in a row, there's no fucking son. You just did crazy. You can't take it anymore, and then one day that sun is there and you're like, ah, it's so beautiful.

Speaker 3:          00:16:46       Some May. Whereas in La were like, fucking son, we're so tired of the sun. We just. People get used to shit. I'm going to call it the Rogan muddle when she's. When she's just depressed. Every rogue of muddle the broadcast in the fuck out of them and they'll surely at some point the cosmos. Yes, and then when it comes on and then they get it. Well not everyone. There's gonna be some people that are always going to be. They're going to always gravitate towards nonsense. There's nothing you can do about that. It's just we're so varied. We're so the, the spectrum of human beings from the smartest to the dumbest is so wide. There's no getting around that. Life experiences, genetics, whatever causes it. I don't know, but there's just certain people that do not give a fuck and they're going to always be there, but concentrating on them, you know, and, and, and, and like it's profitable. Like you could sell them shit. It's a really good if you're, if you're

Speaker 1:          00:17:50       in the business, he days. Uh, I still, you said Lee though I'm perhaps optimistic of Va. I think you could. I think we can sell them. It sounds almost them, this group. Some of them you could sell it. I, I still think you can sell ideas to people. I'm going to mystic about it. Those people maybe not, but there's a lot of fucking people. There's $350 million people in this country alone. we underestimate people. I think I, I've, I've rarely met someone who wasn't interested in. Let me take your sound. Are you going to take home and bring it around some dummies? There's some fucking dummies out there. a lot of smart folks like yourself. You're hanging out at cern, will a bunch of other physicists. You're talking about black holes and chelation effect. You're right. I've never been into the cafeteria at certain. Anyone who's not interested in asking me, man, I hosted fear factor for six years and I'm a cage fighting commentator.

Speaker 1:          00:18:44       There's dummIes out there, there's a unfixable dummies and it's probably not their fault, but it's probably one of the greatest pieces of evidence to do that. Points towards natural selection and point sorts of variability of life and that human beings. We very so strongly that in comparison to other wild animals, if you see wolves, me and you see wolves that are slightly larger and slightly more dominant and wolves that are slightly smaller and slightly more timid and they get pushed out of the pack, but they're all fucking wolves. You See people and you see Brian Cox and then you see kim kardashians. I mean you guys are both on the same timeline here. You're both alive in this point in history and one of you is talking about fucking shoes and the other one is trying to figure out what happened right after the big bang and one of them has a fuck load more people paying attention.

Speaker 1:          00:19:35       Brian cox and it ate you buddy. It's the chick with the fake ass was getting all the eyeballs. Carl sagan is great book, the demon haunted world. I love that book. I mean, he makes the point that the thing is these people, everyone has a vote and rightly so. We live in a democracy right now. You mIght say, well, could we have some kInd of icu, such threshold for the votes, but therefore the direction of our societies ease in principle in the hands of everyone. So, so we can't just accept the fact that you know, well, all right, well one percent of the world's population is going to pay attention to, to reality and the rest of them are going to pay attention to reality tv and they're going to be, we're going to be okay. We're not going to be okay because the 99 percent will be on the web. They're voting for that. They have control and rightly so. We live in a over the direction of our countries. So education is extremely important. It is important for people to sit, for us to try and make available the great swathe of knowledge that we've accumulated over the last. We were absolutely in agreement about that. I just think that the open nature of the internet enhances that more than stifles it. I think

Speaker 3:          00:20:48       there's only good. I only see good. I think I'm a big fan of old shit. I love to go watch old television shows and old, um, old movies and old especially old standup comedy performances because there's not just because it's sort of like a time machine. You're, you're, you're lookIng back at this moment that's been captured, which is absolutely fascinating to me. But also the stark differences to the obvious differences between culture then and culture now between the awareness of the people that like there's some movies that were really good movies, but if you try to wash them today, you go, oh, who's that fucking dumb today? Like no one is that dumb today. It's hard. Like the education level of the people that are communicating in these movies, the way they're there, they view life is very obviously different than the way we view life today.

Speaker 3:          00:21:37       Like you could noT put father knows best on television today because people wouldn't fucking. They're not like not enough. Nope. You gotta it's gotta go to a higher frequency because human beings are very different today than they were in 1950. I think our culture is one of the clearest influences. There's some amazing stuff from 1950, so amazing books that were written. There's amazing films that were made, but the reality is the culture has shifted dramatically in the last 64 years. there's no getting around that. It's changing and I think having something like the internet just pushes that in a direction and the guidelines. You who gets upset, a guy like you who gets upset, all these reality shows, it's really just proof that that this is what you're designed to do. You're like designed to educate these people that are annoying you in these programs that are stupid.

Speaker 3:          00:22:25       That's actually just fuel. It's just giving you more. It's giving you an adversary. It's giving you motivation to stop it from happening. I mean it's. If everybody was going to college and everybody was super educated and really aware of the problems with plastic and fossil fuels and boy, what a weird world we live in, probably nothing would ever get done. Like the battle between the dummies and the people like yourself is essential. It's essential. Then yang idea, the thesis that the defining the motor of civilization and human advancement is irritation with dumb people. I think it is. I don't appreciate naps unless I work out hard. I don't appreciate vacations unless I'm just exhausted. I have to be exhausted with work to appreciate vacations. I must say. It's one of the threads, so maybe we started talking about infinite monkey cage. He's one of the threads through the whole series is a slight annoyance that we turned into into something that's interesting. Generates ideas, pros, I mean one of the. We had a letter about the title, the infinite monkey cage complaining and they shouldn't catch monkeys. It was cruel. Crew is like an infinite. It's an infinite cage. It's me. It's recently love room. It's arguably the universe. There's an infinite cage and then another

Speaker 1:          00:23:46       less it came in. I think it might have been a response. So we'd send that back and they said don't. It's also support in this kind of darwinian myth, the darwinian myth that we're somehow share a common ancestor with a monkey. So how so? And he said, well, there was an experiment done that disproved all your nonsense, like experiments. We like evidence. So This is really interesting. What's the evidence? So we read down and they said there was an experiment done in a zoo in Alabama or somewhere where they got 10 monkeys and they gave them tight writers and after a week all they done was shit on them. So the idea that an infinite number of monkeys could write shakespeare and all that, it's like, well there's a difference between 10 monkeys and an infinite number of monkeys. There's not, you know, 10 is not very close to infinity and it's just these complaints about the.

Speaker 1:          00:24:39       And we were my, my friend robin into our co presented where the. He said, he said it's not an incremental process, this kind of infinite monkey thing. It's not like if you have 100 monkeys then eventually they'll produce a leaflet and then if you have a thousand they'll do maybe a book. if you had 10,000 they'll do shakespeare. And it's not really, we mean it, it's an infinite number of monkeys. You'd need to type out the words. But yeah, we got a lot of. We enjoy the complaint. So we've got a lot from. Yeah. Got a lot of complaints from deepak chopra. Actually, these days he's a silly version late, isn't it? Isn't that one of those things that, that, that. That's like one of those expressions that people always use it. If you take an infinite number of monkeys and given the typewriters, they'll type out shakespeare's works of shakespeare.

Speaker 1:          00:25:20       It's just, is that true? While it is true, it's an infinite number of monkeys have infinite number. I think they're going to fail. They're going to fuck it up. No monkeys. You don't know who's still wonky with talking to me earlier about infinity, you know, but if you get an infinite number of monkeys aren't there, there's the same animal, so the same exact animal. They're going to type the exact works of shakespeare that they will because there's an infinite number of nuts. Every possible combination of less oppressive must happen. Dan is true. Would it happen? What is the odds of it happening in the exact same order of the works of shakespeare isn't even calculus than zero. Less than zero, but integrated in there so that if you've got an infinite number of them and then, then you will get everything that can possibly happen.

Speaker 1:          00:26:06       Will happen, could you imagine if one monkey just randomly, they gave it a key, you know what we're talking about the entire universe, right? So we're talking about an infinite number, but what if they just get lucky as fuck and give one monkey a typewriter and this little dude just starts banging out the entire works of shakespeare, but he's still a monkey. He's stIll like playing with his butt and you know, swInging around and having a good time. He's not doing anything else other than when they put them in front of this keyboard. He types out all the works of shakespeare in exactly the right order, the exact punctuatIon, the exact spaces in between letters. Well, if the universe is infinite, which it may

Speaker 2:          00:26:43       well be, in fact, there are many ways the universe can be infinite, then, um, that would happen because everything that is in accord with the laws of physics, then it can happen. And everything that can happen in an infinite universe will happen because the universe is formerly infinite. So I contend, and we'll probably get emails about. I'm trying to think whether there's any counter argument. I don't think there is. I contend that in an infinite universe, even the most unlIkely possibility must happen, in fact formally an infinite number of times, so maybe shakespeare,

Speaker 3:          00:27:22       a monkey, they just looked. Maybe if someone's pet monkey, we can imagine. We can calculate it

Speaker 2:          00:27:28       when someone can do it online now because there are how many letters are there in shakespeare, the complete works of shakespeare so you can google that. Someone will tell you and we know 26 possibilities and so off we go, and so, so how? What's the probability? What are the odds of randomly typing on site writer, let's say at one letter per second, how long will it take and what are the odds that your type out the complete works of shakespeare? That's a no number. I don't know where my head, but it can be calculated, so that's my challenge to your viewers and listeners sending that email. Someone will do it. There'll be someone working at mit or something. you can do it in five minutes. that's an easy song

Speaker 3:          00:28:07       and then you'd have to calculate how many monkeys start out with romeo and juliet and then just start shitting on their typewriter. That I. I know the answer to that is more than the other ones and the first chapter. Perfect. And then just shit all over the place. The last word. The last single digit. Well, I bet every keystroke along the way there's a monkey shitting on their typewriter. Like you get like the first paragraph. Shit all over the place. This guy got to the second paragraph. Shit all over it.

Speaker 2:          00:28:35       Place to go back to having a monkey cage complaint letter that proves that darwin's wrong. Hey, that's the Logic that. Yeah. Can I just say that if someone doesn't remember, I just came into the podcast at that point. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:28:47       No he doesn't. Yeah, you can't cherry pick that quote. yeah. Just Brian Cox has nothing darwin's wrong. That'll be in the press. There's a great website, a twitter handle called take that darwin where people that are educationally challenged will question darwin's theories like that. My favorite one is, you know, people came from monkeys. Monkeys are still around like dave retweet that all day because someone adjust that fundamental misunderstanding of evolution that that really is, you know, you're going right where I'm going to start maybe with the book. The only wAy to truly test is to, I think we'll really need to do is take monkeys and give them psychedelic drugs. We need to do this. Someone needs to do this. Didn't need to take an island where the monkeys can't escape and give them psychedelic drugs and leave them puzzles and see what they figured out. Why does that test anything doesn't. I would just be fun

Speaker 1:          00:29:41       to watch. There is a. A guy named terrence mckenna who I'm a huge fan of who had a a theory called the stoned ape theory and he backed it up, allegedly remember who this is coming from a with climate to logical data on that time of the world that he believes that the evolution of human beings, the a big part of it, the development of the human brain might have come from them experimenting with psychedelic mushrooms. That as the rain forest receded into grasslands, animals were forced to try new foods out because their habitat was changing and they would climb down for these trees and flip over these cow patties to get bugs and worms and things along those lines and that this time of the world, it was very common to have these psilocybin mushrooms growing all over the place and that the monkeys that would eat them, he had a bunch of theories like apparently it's been proven that in low doses, psilocybin increases visual acuity, which would make you able to see things better, which would make you a better hunter also makes you horny so it would make people more likely to breed and that would favor the people or the monkeys rather.

Speaker 1:          00:30:51       The, the subhuman primates, whatever you call them, that that went along that line. What is it is one of them. Will I be accepted theories about hominid evolution is that is that climate change played a key role and actually there's in my life to say receiving universe, we. We focused on a a theory which links the climate change, particularly in the rift valley because we know that the big jumps in brain size all occurred and enriched valley of africa and it's quite remarkable actually and that that broadly speaking, accepted. I think although I love argument with anthropologists because the dates or his spouse, you know, but it's broadly accepted that and it seems that the big gym sitting in brain size occurred at times when the soul bates was most elliptical. So the slb oscillates. It becomes more elliptical than most circular and there are many different oscillations driven by gravitational interaction with the planets like jupiter in particular, and it seems like when the ssl based mostly elliptical the the rate of climate change and the rift valley is higher and more extreme and it seems to be the case that this relatively strong evidence for the case that when you get these rapid times of climate change you mentioned, then you get increases in hominin brain size and therefore increase in intelligence is a big wig at one point eight.

Speaker 1:          00:32:08       One point 8 million years ago, which was a very big increase in the number of species in the rift valley, of which homo erectus was one of them, which eventually led to us and a big a big jump in brain size as well, and this was at a time when there was strong evidence for rapid climate change in that, in that region. So that makes sense. Like the adaptability of these animals experimented with new food sources, trying out new hunting methods. They, a lot of them changed from herbivore, omnivore a lot of the primates that were observed. Right. I get it. That's where it gets controversial

Speaker 2:          00:32:39       when you look at the academic research because the what, so you the darwinian idea that. So you get this pressure from climate change, but then what's the selection effect? Because climaTe change happens over many generations, it doesn't happen over one generation. so. so the question is, well, what actually is doing the selecting? What are we selecting for? Why is this group I'm more likely to breed and be more successful if it's more intelligent? So some people say, well it's because we, they were forced into groups, so it's group dynamics is the fact that you end up with bigger tribes, you know, hundreds of individuals cooperating together and that's what's been selected for and you need to be intelligent for that. Some people say as you said, that it's more adaptability, so maybe they have to learn to go fishing or they have to learn to eat a particular different crops and then maybe that's.

Speaker 2:          00:33:25       So that's a big area of debate about what might have been the, the, the selection pressure, this precise selection pressure. But it does seem pretty nAiled down that climate change certainly in that region of africa, in Ethiopia and Tanzania and through the rift valley had played a role in driving us towards intelligence and essentially shape scales. Very small. By the way. I mean, did you go back 4 million years and you'll. things like australopithecus are around. We should basically outright chimpanzees. The brain is not much bigger than a modern day chimp. But then you go to 200,000 years ago and that's when homosapiens first emerge and just over 200,000 years, which is not very long ago, and it's quite remarkable actually, and that the modern theories, they get spread out of africa that 60,000 years ago and they made it into europe about 43,000 years ago also into north America and south America only 15,000 years ago. So it's a very, quite a rapid spread. And the fact that we've only been around as a species for at most a quarter of a million years, a quarter of 1 million years is quite remarkable. I think.

Speaker 4:          00:34:28       Well, when you think about what we've accomplished, I was flying into los angeles last night and I was thinking if you could take the pioneers that came from europe in the 17 and 18 hundreds. The guys who were on those wagons with the wooden wheels and they're pulling them with horses across the country trying to see what's over there. If you could show them like, hey man, this is what's going to go down in 2015 hop on this plane. Look out this window. Oh, look at that grid. TheY would freak the fuck out. They saw all the electricity. That's the sky of los angeles, in my opinion. Los angeles. More beautiful at night than any other city because it's so spread out. It's all lights as you're flying in. It looks so science fiction. You know, I, I, um,

Speaker 2:          00:35:12       recently interviewed the astronaut charlie duke who landed on the moon, the apollo astronauts. And he said to me, his father couldn't believe it because he, he was alive when the wright brothers flew. So he, his father's spanned the time from the wright brothers to an, he was alive and then he, some walked on the moon in one lifetime, 60 years. Seventy years.

Speaker 4:          00:35:35       The real, the real mind fuck is

Speaker 1:          00:35:38       with the creation of the plane to the time someone dropped an atomic bomb from the plane is less than 50 years. Yeah. And the nuclear physics, we didn't know. We didn't know there was an italian. Rutherford discovered the atomic nucleus in manchester in a. Was it 1912 or so? I should know. But anyway, 17, 19, 12 and 13. So he discovers the nucleus and within 30 years you have an atomic bomb, didn't even know. And, and rutherford we actually asked at the time, he said, it's the usual question we get as physicists. They say, what's the use of this? And uh, and, and rutherford said that there's no use to it. You said anyone who thinks that you could use this as an energy source is talking moonshine and within 30 or 40 years you have nuclear reactors producing power and you have atomic bombs.

Speaker 1:          00:36:25       A rapid rapid progress. Well, that's one thing that's been constant about people and predicting the future. And we've always got it wrong. Oh, well, we, we miss some of the rapid advances. You know, we talked about, you know, there's a computer on a phone here. You're the fact that the modern electronics is a single lifetime. The transistor is what, 19 forties, I think bell labs here in the us not long ago. You know that you go from that to this. I mean we talked about the apollo. I mean this is significantly more powerful than anything that was available in the world when apollo was there. The room rooms filled with computers at nasa, which we're nowhere near as powerful as that. It's amazing. I mean that's those google glasses that people are wearing is a sign of things to come. In my opinion, they just stopped making them.

Speaker 1:          00:37:13       But there, there's a new company that has like a goggle. It looks like a skiing goggle and it allows you to move things in front of you like a virtual desktop. You can spin squares, hold things in place, throw things to the side, and they disappear. I mean, we're, we're going to get really, really, really weird within the next couple decades. I've actually seen some of that technology is a company called magic leap and I've been there in miami. So you saw it in person. What does it look really? It does indeed. Um, you, you can put three d objects into your field of vision. So how is that working? So you've, you've actually seen it. I said, dad, you can't talk, but I'll tell you that it works. It's a remarkable thing about google. It just bought the company. Actually we, yeah, we played it. We played some videos of it and we couldn't figure out whether we were watching a simulation.

Speaker 1:          00:37:59       We're watching what the future holds or we're watching an actual demonstration of that technology. Yeah. Oh, it's going to be impressive. I think. And it's interesting what You said because it brings the, the, the, the, the web this limited information into your field of vision so you can manipulate it. And then there are questions about, well, what's real and what isn't and who, who cares. Anyway, really. And it's so interest. Interesting. Do you dabble at all in the theory of some sort of an artificial world that we live in, these ideas of simulation do dabble in that or is it just too much? And actually, I mean the, the, uh, a

Speaker 2:          00:38:36       colleague of mine, I mentioned, there are some physicists who you think that it's a possibility, a strong possibility that we're living in a simulation. Um, I mean it's, you know, it's speculative out their stuff, but it's an attempt to explain some properties of the universe that are, that are interesting and unusual. So, so one of my favorite, I think at the moment, piece of cutting edge physics and cosmology, cosmology, I should say, the study of the universe, the origin and evolution of the universe is going through a revolution at the moment and he's coming from data. So it's coming from measurements of things like the cosmic microwave background radiation, which is the oldest light in the universe. We're making it. So just to rewind and say what that is. And 380,000 years after the big bang, the universe became transparent for the first time to light.

Speaker 2:          00:39:23       And that's because it was, it was cooling down as he would expanding and cooling. Then atoms formed, it became cool enough for atoms to form. And at that moment, very, very quickly, uh, the universe becomes transparent and so photons of light can travel on through the universe and they've been doing so ever since. And we can take a photograph of that. And we have done with a series of satellites, the most recent of which is called plank, which is european satellite. This up there. So this is a picture of baby picture of the universe as it was 380,000 years after the big bang, and it's very beautiful picture, but in explaining that a, that's given support to theories called inflationary cosmology theories. So inflationary cosmology theories say that before the universe was hot and dense, which we tend to call the big bang before that, the universe was still there and he was doing something else which was an exponential expansion.

Speaker 2:          00:40:13       So it was expanding exponentially fast, way faster than the speed of light. Then it stops and all the energy that was causing that expansion gets dumped into space, heats it up, and that's what we see as the particles and energy today. So those theories are kind of interested, but they also suggest there are. There are things called eternal inflation theories that say, well how long did that period of expansion go on for? And does it all stop at one? So does it stop in patches? And if it stops in patches, you get it stopped a little patch, you'd get a big bang in the universe and it starts another patch. You get another big bang the universe, so, so these theories suggest perhaps there were an infinite number possibly have a big banks in inverted commerce, which would mean there are an infinite number of universities like ours and, and they're beIng created now all the time and they will continue to be created ever.

Speaker 2:          00:41:04       so you get this fractal multiverse ever growing exponentially fast. And really bizarrely, that those theories have some support from the, from the cosmic microwave background. There are theories that explain the structures we see. I should just underline the fact that this is speculative in a sentence, but it, but it's um, but it's relatively mainstream that. But one of my colleagues noticed, some physicists have noticed is if you were some kind of omnipotent deity programmer and you want it to run what's called a monte carlo simulation to say, well, I'll vary the strength of gravity in one universe and vary the massive, the electron and another one. I'm very these physical constants and see what happens then this is probably this kind of thing you do. This is what he would kind of look like so that you can make an argument that the universe in some sense looks like one of these kinds of so called monte carlo simulations because it gives you the possibility of generating every possible number of different ratio to the strengths of the forces of nature and all these things.

Speaker 2:          00:42:06       So I just have to emphasize this is way out there way on the edge, but it's fun. And what is fun and interesting though is it the wind all the way back, the inflationary cosmology bit is, is probably the most widely accepted theory at the moment for how the universe got to be the way it is and he does lend itself to this idea that there may be a multiverse and and it may be that in, in each different pocket universe if you'd like. You can have different physical constants. So most of them wouldn't allow life to exist. But some of them would say our universe looks very fine tuned. and if you look at it in a sense it looks like that they belong with nature. We're very slightly different. You wouldn't get carbon, for example, produced In stars in large quantities, which you need in order to the stars die, the carbon and the oxygen come out and they rican lapse into another generation of stars and solar systems and that's how you get the heavy elements that make up our bodies and so all those things look you need.

Speaker 2:          00:43:02       You either try and find an explanation for why the laws of nature of the way they are or you. You go to one of these multiverse theories and say, well actually goes back to what we talked about earlier about the infinite monkeys and me actually every possibility occurs in nature and then we shouldn't. Shouldn't be surprised that we live in a universe that's seems fine tuned for life seems perfect for us to exist in because every possible combination of the laws of nature exists somewhere, and this is where cosmology is at the moment, is this is genuine. You could go onto the web and google it, you'll find a thousand review papers on what's called an inflationary cosmology and it is cool and interest in actually.

Speaker 3:          00:43:41       Yeah, it's beyond that. It's, it's very. The idea of something being infinite and not just infinite, but infinite numbers of these infinite things, infinite numbers of infinite universities, these, these theories exist. So This idea of computer simulation, the idea that the world we live in, the universe we live in is a simulation. That was the question that you asked actually because we went on as beautiful. Don't change a thing. You stay you. The idea being that one day if human beings continue to increase our technological abilities, one day we're like, we're talking about this magic leap and we're talking about the goggles that allow you to see a virtual world. We're going to, if we don't ourselves up or get hit

Speaker 1:          00:44:32       by an asteroid, we're going to come up with something that is indistinguishable from the reality that we see right now. And when people start examining the nature of the universe and they start looking at the fractal nature of things and looking at like what you were saying, that if you were going to be some omnipotent deity that creates the university, probably do something like this, like every single combination and throw them out there. So when we discover is is James Gates that was the guy's name investigates, investigates. It was a guy who spoke to neil degrasse tyson about string theory and that they've found in string theory the computer code that was created by humans and like the 19 thirties they. They figured this out and that this actually exists in these codes in string theory. and his idea was that that somehow another proves that there is some evidence support that life.

Speaker 1:          00:45:28       The reality that we see right now is a simulation. Or it could be that which way more likely that you're just discovering some sort of code that the entire universe is based on. That. When you look at things being fractal and you look at the idea of there being not just infinite expansion but infinite contraction and that there is no smallest point. There's just smaller than we can measure. But when we talk about subatomic particles and we talk about things being like adam's being mostly air and then you go deeper and deeper and you don't know what the fuck is going on and particles are blinking in and out of existence and existing at the same time, both moving and still la. but could it be that you just got to keep going? We just can't see it. Well, the. I mean the answer is, I mean we still have three know what the fuck's going on.

Speaker 1:          00:46:13       Some level of political. If you look to the lhc, the large hadron collider, which is the place where we generate the highest energy. So it's the biggest microscope in the world. In essence, we have an extremely good understanding of the laws of physics at that level and up to and including the discovery of the higgs particle. It's been proven. Is that debate at all the higgs? Because I remember there was some people that were debating whether or not the higgs boson bows on the. There's a new, the analytical data that we've discovered and it has all the right properties to be the. The predicted standard model higgs, politically, please explain what that means. Political. It was predicted back in the sixties. My pizza higgs, this man, his name, and it's a. The idea is basically the early on in the expansion history of the universe, so let's say less than a billionth of a second, after the big bang as the universe cooled, it went through something condensed out into empty space. So if people call a phase transition over, but it's analogous to a window pane on a cold winter's day. Die of cold winter days in la dia. but if you were to get ice on a window, it's analogous to say, well, it's a vapor condensing it into ice. As you drop the temperature changes into something else to into eyes. So in the same way that the theory is that as the universe cooled, something condensed

Speaker 2:          00:47:30       out, so empty space isn't empty. It's full of higgs particles, if you like, or a higgs field. So every bit. So this means this space now, not just space between the galaxies in this room that every square meter over this room is full of the higgs field. And our fundamental particles, the electrons, let's say in our bodies, interact with that higgs field and in that process they acquire mass. So it's the, it's the mass generation mechanism is why some particles are massive, like electrons and quarks and some things like photons are not massive. They're massless and then travel through the universe at the speed of light. So that's the theory now that was suggested and built a mathematically essentially there's early evidence for it at the time back in the sixties, but over the years, uh, the theory called the standard model of particle physics, past all experimental tests.

Speaker 2:          00:48:21       So we got to the point where we thought, right, okay, we will build a machine that will either disprove or prove that theory and the lhc is such a machine. If that theory is correct, which now seems to be it, the prediction is you must find the higgs particle at the lhc or some kind of higgs particle. And indeed we found it. We, as far as we can tell. So that means that we found a new particle. It has the right mass as predicted in the window that was predicted by the theory. It behaves in every way the theory Predicts. So now what we have to do is be experimental physicists. So the alex turns back on again in about a month actually, so it's been upgraded, it's been fixed and it's done. It's maintenance. So we're going to make more higgs particles now and that means we can make more precision measurements and find out whether it is the particle predicted by peter higgs or maybe it's one of a number of particles, just possibly likely not now, but it might be.

Speaker 2:          00:49:14       So it might be five of them, for example, which would suggest that theories called supersymmetric theories are right. So. So we need to know exactly which precisely had the thing behaves, which is why we have more work to do, but it looks like it's very sure, very sure that it is a higgs particle that you can just, you can mess around and build isa terrick theories that get around it, but there is a new particle there. There's no doubt about that. And it looks like one of these things, but that's the remarkable thing. I think about it because it was wagner when a great physicist wrote an essay back in the sixties, I think called the unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics and the physical sciences and the unreasonable effectiveness is demonstrated by this discovery because it really is a mathematical prediction is we think there's a new fundamental particle that does the job of giving math to the other particles and this is how it does it and this is how it behaves and this is what it will look like and this is what it will do.

Speaker 2:          00:50:06       And then 50 years later you build the biggest machine ever built 60 miles into conference. Most of it's in France, a bit of it's in Switzerland, tense scientists, hundred and 50 countries. You, you accelerate. Protons are the nuclei of hydrogen around this thing at 99 point nine, nine, nine, nine, nine, nine percent. The speed of light, they go around the 16 miles thousand times a second. We can collide $600, million of them together every second to recreate the conditions that were present less than a billionth of a second after the universe began photographing in the big east digital cameras ever built. The one I Work on called atlas is 40, 40 meters in diameter, vast vast thing, 7,000 tons of digital camera in a cabin beside st paul's cathedral underneath the ground in Switzerland and you find it, you find this guy, but he's a higgs working with many of the people predicted to exist 50 years ago because he did some sums and so it's a real.

Speaker 2:          00:51:04       It's real. So the universe does behave like that. There is a condensate in the vacuum. It is a higgs condensate. It does give mass to do the particles. So it's a tremendous testament to the power of human reasoning, I think, and it means that we understand physics. It means that we. That's one of the important things about it. It means that our, our understanding of fundamental physics is not horribly wrong at the moment. It's, it's, it's good enough to predict something like that, which is a remarkable achievement that is mind blowing. that is truly, truly mind blowing. Do you know when peter higgs? Actually, so the day that the discovery was announced at cern, packed auditorium and peter was there and a journalist went up to him afterwards and just what I've said, this is what happened. This machine did a family thing and said, how do you feel? Professor hagen? And he said, it's very nice to be right. Sometimes

Speaker 3:          00:51:57       really understated british and yes he is. There you go. That's exactly how a cup of tea american would show up with a fur coat on diamonds around his glasses. We have a big pimp cane and then someone had come up, have given the nobel prize to beyonce because that'd be grammys last night, wasn't it? Was it was. It was. It was in Kenya. West wasn't. It keeps jumping on stage. Well, he jumped on stage once, right? He didn't do it again last night. Did he? Apparently, ginny almost have it go. He said, I can't be bothered, so I just keep thinking part of the problem. You just want to talk about kanye west, the middle of the. One of the last discussions I called the other guy jay zed called z zed. That's a british thing. People don't know like a zero. Six is a type of corvette. They call it zedo six. So jason was copy of the large hadron collider also figured out or or proved proved cork. Gluon plasma. Yeah, so that is explain that the

Speaker 2:          00:53:14       universe in the history of the universe, so so way after the higgs mechanism kicks in, you get an. You have a period when it's still too hot for protons and neutrons to form the building blocks of atomic nuclei or protons and neutrons day. So a proton is made of two up quarks. Quarks and a damn clock and a neutron is made a $2 and then up and then some of the stuff in there, glue gluons and things like that, but what the universe was winter aphasia and it was too hot for that to happen. so you get this plasmid is see of the free quarks and gluons and all these things just before it gets cold enough to condense into protons and neutrons and we investigate that by colliding a heavier things in protons together at the lhc so we can do silver atoms or a silver nuclei or lead nuclei and things like that.

Speaker 2:          00:54:01       The lhc can do that and it produces this fat a millionth of a second after the big bang. So quite a long time. Quite a bit. This is a lot has happened in that relatively. So we can do that as well and see how that phase of the universe behaved and that stuff is supposed to be just immeasurably heavy. Right? oh, the atomic nuclei. Yeah. Yeah. I mean if you look at. So it astrophysical example would be a neutron star, which is basically a big nucleus, nuclear dense material. The end point of a collapse star when it's run out of fuel, maybe it's not too big. It's too big. It'll turn into a black hole. So neutron star would be a one and a half times the mass of the sun. Let's say something like that, but it will be a radius of 10 miles, so it would easily fit in the la metropolitan area. Right. But it would have the mass of the sub or greater. So that's an atomic nucleus density. That's how you can imagine it. Something as massive as some compressing something 10 miles across and we see these things all over the years. Neutron stars are fascinating things.

Speaker 2:          00:55:08       Someone online was explaining it. Some physicists was explaining that if you had this court glue on plasma and it was the size of a sugar cube, it was some ungodly amount of weight. Yeah. like he couldn't even imagine it. You know, mount everest, you know, that kind of who'd be like mount everest can't quite enormous broke my brain, be thinking about all our lady to earlier all the mess our mass is in the nuclei and if you've got all our nuclei mining your nuclei and stuffed them together into that density that, you know, it would be a grain of sand or something less. So you could. I mean, you think about the unit, I mean the modern theories of the big bang it talked about earlier, these inflationary cosmology theories, those suggest that the entire observable universe, which has now got $350 billion galaxies in it, was some point the size of a, I dunno, a baseball or less so, so we imagine that we speak of in, in modern physics, we have theories to address the time when the entire observable universe was something that you could hold, so you've got enough energy in there to make $350, galaxies each with 200 billion stars and it's remarkable that we're not quite there with the laws of physics, but we're not far that.

Speaker 2:          00:56:31       Those are the kind of. That's the physics we're doing at lhc. Basically. We're trying to explore the laws of nature and seat, find the laws of nature will describe the universe when it was that hot and that dense and we are quite close. I say we were good from about a billionth of a second after the big bang. Then that's where we have our theories that talk about the higgs boson and things, and so we understand that very well. Um, so the, the, the challenge now is to get back beyond that and that's where you, that's where string theory attempts to live, which you mentioned earlier string theory. We don't know if it's right. We have no evidence to that. That is an approach to trying to describe the universe before, uh, those times when our current laws work,

Speaker 4:          00:57:12       the idea of a birth and a death of a universe trouble. Some people, the idea that we have sort of artificially subscribed the idea that this had to start somewhere and that it may very well be an infinite expansion and contraction like waves going in waves going out. The idea being that the entire universe may one day get to a point where it pulls down into itself and becomes one event. Horizon one infinite peace of mass and then starts all over again. Is that possible? The current, if you look at the,

Speaker 2:          00:57:46       how the universe is expanding at the moment than it is accelerating in its expansion. So the measurements tell us that the expansion rate itself is getting faster and uh, we have, uh, a name for that and we call it dark energy. And so the of older 65, 70 percent of the energy in the universe appears to be taken up in, in driving this increasingly fast expansion. And so that looks like if nothing happens, then that becomes dominant. So, so, so it continues to accelerate and expansion. And in the end you get something that looks like this inflationary period that I said may, may have existed before the universe was hot and dense. So it looks like. So that looks like what's happening at the moment. So whether that can stop where, whether there's something that can stop it in the same way as it seems to have stopped very early in the history by the way. And whether that's true, nobody knows, we don't know the mechanism, but the measurements tellers have distant. Particularly looking at supernova in distant galaxies. And also actually from this cosmic microwave background radiation. I mentioned earlier that the detailed modeling and measurements of that old consistent and that the university is accelerating in its expansion, so that would suggest that it's not going to rebound because it's everything. It's like a big rip scenario almost where everything's accelerated. That space time is stretching it a faster and faster rate at the moment. That seems to be what's happening,

Speaker 4:          00:59:12       so you feel that it's much more likely that there are infinite numbers of these things happening, that there's not just one big bang that creates this universe and we're watching this universe expand, but that there's infinite numbers of these things that are happening at the exact same time. That said,

Speaker 2:          00:59:33       that's most speculative, so, so the waY that the inflation is probably textbook. Now you got some physicists that will argue with it, but broadly speaking, I think many astrophysicists think the inflation is the best theory we have because it makes predictions that agree with observation. So it's. It's the best theory in terms of making the best predictions at the moment in this is that exact suggested expansion. Very fast, super luminal faster than light expansion. That stops and the end point of that is what we used to call the Big bang and so, so that's broadly speaking, textbook stuff. That's what you teach and undergraduate Cosmology causes that. Then some physicists argue that the natural extension to those theories, the theories called eternal inflation, which are what you said where you said this, this, this exponential expansion of space time is always going on and it stopped just in little patches and that little patch is where you generate a new pocKet universe if you like, of which ours is one example, and you can have an infinite number of those and they were being that they would be being produced now and you can asK the question, how long has that been going on?

Speaker 2:          01:00:43       And the answer is nobody knows, and there's a debate even amongst the people who believe in those theories about whether it could have gone on forever or whether it would have started in what a colleague of mine at durham, carlos frank calls the mother of all big bangs. So was the mother of all bIg bangs that set this process in motion. And in that thing that got said, that big fractal thing, you get loads of little bit guys, and the answer is this is cutting edge stuff. It's very exciting. Um, but so, so I'd say just to be very precise, the inflationary bit, the simple bits which was first put forward in the eighties actually by alan guth and people like that in the us and andre, linda, another one that looks right in the sense that it matches data very well and the consequences of it are argued about an interactive areas of research at the moment. One of the things that

Speaker 4:          01:01:31       people were terrified of about the large hadron collider is that in trying to find the higgs that you might accidentally create black holes, little tiny one, so it would just go eat and through the earth, like a, like a little ping pong ball that's shot through the entire planet that that's idiots like me that thought that, holy shit, is it possible to create a big bang or excuse me, a black hole? Is that, is it possible theoretically to have enough power? Like if you don't have it right now with the large hadron collider, is it possible that a larger machine will be created and human beings can recreate a black hole?

Speaker 2:          01:02:09       Yes, it's possible. And it's possible if You have extra dimensions in the universe. Right? So the thing is that, so we need gravity's. A very weak force is by far the weakest of the four fundamental forces of nature be billions and billions of times a week. And the other ones, which you can tell because you can pick up your phone, even though the planet, planet earth is trying to stop me doing that, and I can just resist the pull of planet. So gravity is very weak. So that gives you a clue that you can say, well, what energy? How far do I have to go back in time? If you like, towards the big bang before it's so hot that the, that gravity is as strong as the other forces. The strength of the force is varies, I should say, with, with, with energy. So they changed so that.

Speaker 2:          01:02:54       And we've seen this behavior, so so two of the forces, so-called electromagnetism, which is the most familiar on electricity, that one a and the weak nuclear force, which is one of the forces that operates in the atomic nucleus. They are the same force. They're manifestations of the same force, and we've seen this experimentally, and in fact the higgs boson is part of that process. And so we've seen the energies that they become the same force. So the idea is the other force, the strong nuclear force, if you go to higher energies and temperatures convergys and they'd have some things called grand unified theories, and then gravity makes it a lethargic way back and, and unifies with them. It's something called the planck energy, which is immense. The short timescales after the origin of the universe have you on so very, very hot, so, so way in excess of anything.

Speaker 2:          01:03:39       So if you just want to just create black holes in a lab, then the nike thing is you'd have to go to those energies and there's nowhere in the universe. You'd never do it. So you'd have a part accelerated the side of the observable universe and they wouldn't be big enough, but if you allow extra dimensions in space, so you might imagine that we will live in a three dimensional space and then there's time as well as four dimensions if you allow it to be five or six or 30. Nothing to string theory that they keep changing their mind, but there's 13 now, something like that, and then what you can do is you can arrange for that energy scale at which gravity becomes important to to, to to come up. So the temperatures to drop so you can arraign. You can arrange in some contrived way to get to the point where you could possibly access gravity, see gravity in action as it were in particle accelerators, at things as big as the lhc, and in that case you would produce we little black holes, which would then evaporate away very quickly.

Speaker 2:          01:04:42       We think through a process called hawking radiation and they be. They began. So you can conceive of a way that you could, if given a big of a leap, that there are extra dimensions in the universe and given that they're configured in the right way, that you can imagine that you could do it. The the. The interesting point though is that so lhc is, is it's a tremendous technological achievement, but it collides particles together, energies that are just insignificant compared to the energies that are available in the universe to nature. So cosmic rays, for example, hit the earth with energies far in excess of those that we generated, lhc. So whatever physics she can conceivably access of these parcels, accelerators is already been access now in the upper atmosphere of the planet because the cosmic ray collisions are immensely higher energy. So so you can make little black holes because they're extra dimensions in the universe.

Speaker 2:          01:05:36       Then they are raining down on us. Now they're here. They get made because the, the energies of the lhc is, I said, astrophysical processes all over the universe, way in excess way exceed those energies. We were not very good at doing high energy collisions compared to nature. That's a supernova, explosions and compared to all the and cosmic rays because it cosmic ray actually that was detected, I think the highest energy one was the had the energy of a professional tennis player serve so hundred mile an hour tennis ball. Right? And it's a single particle. So imagine getting hit by a hundred mile an hour. Professional tennis players serve on the back of their head, their cosmic rays with that energy. But the one particle of would be equal to 100 miles an hour tennis ball. So these are credible energies. Way beyond any how many particles would be in a tennis ball.

Speaker 2:          01:06:29       Oh, it's a good question. That. So let's do some sort of thing. So, so I have a gander. Rose number is what is it? Six times 10 to the 23, isn't it? That's right. So that, that's the number of particles in the number of atoms, let's say in 12 grams of carbon. So it solved the old of. So tends to the 23. Is it 10 to 24 is a million million, million million, right? So that. So a million, million, million, million particles would be what you'd have in atoms or carbon you'd have in a. You find me on the spot here on you if that's what you'd have in about what? Sixty, 60 grams of carbon or something like that. So you've asked to guess. I'd say something like that.

Speaker 2:          01:07:12       And that's chemistry. See I don't do chemistry, but that's out there. Just floating around and we got rid of the galaxy. Like when a hyper nova, you still trying to do the math made? Sure. Because we live on the web. I don't want to get it right. I get older. people do that all the time. The show's all about wrong answers. You're just talking. It's not your field of study. I understand, but it should be really, really good. Chemistry. I think chemistry or physics, but bigger blogs. I've watched a documentary once on hyper novas that when they were first discovering the gamma burst in the galaxy, they thought it was aliens having wars with each other. That was one of the. One of the ideas that were being bandied about. Great. I mean, people do legitimately look for signatures from alien civilizations like that sort of.

Speaker 2:          01:08:02       Yeah, But it's kinda mad people who do it, but they're actually, you can do. There are papers written about because you might say what would the signature of a, of an interstellar star looked like? Presumably be a matter and antimatter drive or something like that. So you get these very Clear signatures of matter and antimatter annihilation that we know about because we do that, that particular photons, gamma rays with particular energies and so you can, you can actually say, well shall we have a look? What would it look like if we saw an interstellar civilization and interspace fair in civilization? Could we detect the signatures? So there's a bit of work done on that and we don't see any. We don't see any evidence for anything. Well, when you see someone like the people that run seti search for extraterrestrial intelligence and they're always like asking for funding and like, you know, we need more funding.

Speaker 2:          01:08:47       We have to figure this out. and one day, what if we shut down? And then the signal comes like, that seems to me to be like one of the biggest, like hail mary wishes, like hoping that you're going to find a radio signal from a galaxy far, far away that has intelligent life. I mean our galaxy. Well, it's interesting though that if you ask astronomers, so you say what's the probability of civilization has been out there. Then they will point, for example, to the new data from the capitalist space telescope which tells us that there are probably around 20 billion earth like planets in the milky way galaxy in the sense that they're small rocky planets in what's called the habitable zone around stars. The goldIlocks main sequence. Stars like the earth, like the sun. So, so 20 billion. So maybe one in 10 stars in the sky has an earth like planets around it potentially.

Speaker 2:          01:09:35       So that's a lot. So you think 20 billion devices, surely life must have a on on some of those. The answer is probably yes. I suspect. I suspect we'll, we'll, we may find life on mars in the next 10 years, but it will be microbes. So the question then becomes, well, how likely is it for simple life if it arises to make its way into a civilization? And that's where the biologists come in and kind of calm the astronomers down and say, well, you might think there are lots of places for life we would agree, but on earth it took three point 8 billion years to go from the origin of life to a civilization which is about a third of the age of the universe, give or take. So you had to have an unbroken, stable line of life. the, the, the, that, that, um, that evolves in the, in the right way as it were to.

Speaker 2:          01:10:23       So first of all, it gets complex. I mean, it took. There's a thing called the cambrian explosion in the history of life on earth, which was about 550 million years ago or so, we sounds like a long time. But for 3 billion years before that, there was nothing that we would Call complex single celled organisms doing some clever Stuff like photosynthesis, but not much. and then suddenly you get a big jump in the oxygen content. Of the atmosphere on earth, which was to do with photosynthesis and some geology in play with it. That's how the oxygen gets into the atmosphere and then you get a big jump and you get complex life emerging and then pretty quickly, you know, half a billion years or so, you go from complex things to to civilization. But even then you think about homo sapien. As we mentioneD earlier, they only arose 200,000 years ago.

Speaker 2:          01:11:12       So for, for the vast majority of the history of life on earth, that has been nothing that could do anything clever in the sense of thinking, building spacecraft and radio telescopes. So, so does it really legitimate debate about whether the undoubted increase in. We know now that there are homes for life out there in the milky way. They're very common. We know that, but we don't know is the probability that life will emerge in the first place. And secondly, the probabIlity that will be turned into a civilization. And I think that's very low. So I think like I think the ability, if I guessed, I would say the probability that life will emerge given the right conditions is very high and what one piece of evidence you could put forward to that is that it did appear to emerge on earth as soon as he could after the formation of the earth and the oceans.

Speaker 2:          01:11:59       So you get life. But then it took a long time on earth. So you mIght say, well the, you know, the provost of it doing anything intelligent and interesting, quite low, maybe less than one in 20 billion, in which case you. We ended up being the only civilization in the milky way at the moment. It is possible. You can make the argument and my experience is academic biologists tend to be on the cautious side and an astronomist tend to be on the optimistic side. It's all relative though, isn't it? Because even if we are only one out of this entire milky way galaxy, you still believe that it's possible for an infinite number of monkeys to create the works of shakespeare. So really look at the entire. Yeah, because they have to. We did that with remember, but if you look at the entire universe than the idea of there being not just a life form like human beings, but the exact same life form is not just once but an infinite number of times in the universe.

Speaker 2:          01:12:59       That's the universe. I'm sure. I mean there are 350 billion galaxies in the observable universe, so it would be surely there are civilizations out there and more advanced as well. Yeah, I'm sure. I'm sure that's the shore and it has to be the case in an infinite universe as you say, but it confined ourselves to the milky way, which is really the only place we have any hope of exploring or contacting anyone will never contacted anyone. Even in the andromeda galaxy. Two point 2 million light years away, but we won't. We won't, but. But the milky way, if there's someone there, we could at least aspire to contact them, so it's worth the effort to listen. We don't spend much money on it. It's we're spending too little on the. I think it would be a tremendous discovery if we made it as far as something like that.

Speaker 2:          01:13:43       It's worth listening because you know, when he started back with Frank Drake and carl sagan and others back in the sixties, then they are. No planets have been discovered beyond the, beyond the solar system numb. So you the only planet we knew our planets now, as I said, we've discovered thousands of planets confirm discoveries and the statistics tell you there are billions of them out there. So virtually every style probably has a planetary system. So, so the, the statistics have gone in the favor of seti from the astronomical perspective. But as I say, you've also got to have the time to make things like us, uh, you know, and that, that's a torturous process. There's no inevitability to evolution. I think it's not, it's not, uh, uh, not to be seen as some march to complexity. Evolution is, it's, it, it, it does. What it does is single celled organisms were very, very good at just surviving and getting on with it for, over, for most of the history of life on earth.

Speaker 2:          01:14:40       So it may be that complex, multicellular life is kind of a just an aberration, really. It's just a bit of a lucky accident. So it's all really just perspective when you think about it because there's, even though there is enormous galaxy, relatively speaking, it's one tiny on that big little thing in comparison to the rest of the universe. So even if we could find something out there, the likelihood of it being as advanced as us are very small, but it's just a matter of how far we can reach or how far we can see. I w I wouldn't go there. NobodY knows it. The what, what people do now I think is that the milky way is probably the boundary of our aspirations. It's for this generation or forever. I think so what if we live a 100,000 years in public? Keep the galaxies are hundred thousand light years across the $200 million star systems in it.

Speaker 2:          01:15:37       It's big, it's too big it. But that, that's not. So you could just about perhaps conceive in the far future of beginning to spread out into the milky way. You could conceive of that, um, it given hundreds thousands of years, right? But then if you then you go, well, where's the next galaxy andromeda to over 2 million light years away. So the idea that you would get across a distance of 2 million light years with any conceivable technology is to me probably. I mean, it takes light a light beam to 2 million years. So if you want to talk to someone in andromeda, you, it will take 200, 2 million years to get a message out there and 2 million years to get it back. So there's a full million round trip. That's the nearest galaxy. It's big, right? It's big, but it's so, so you can imagine possibly the milky way.

Speaker 2:          01:16:32       It's some chance if there are other civilizations there talking to them. But I think beyond that, I just cannot conceive of how it will be done. Is this relative though a perspective to the single celled organisms that existed billions of years ago in comparison to us? Do we really think that we're the end all be all? And this is the last stop on the road to evolution isn't impossible that we get so advanced if we lIve to be another billion years that we Can all these ideas that we have in oUr head about the laws of space and time and the, the, the, what particle physicists are trying to figure out and what string theorists are prescribing as far as, you know, 15 different dimensions that we just send it to them. I know that that's pretty unfair to them, but I want to get into that because I don't understand string theory.

Speaker 2:          01:17:18       No, I don't know, but I understand what you're saying. Either my. But my idea is that if we continue to go on the same path, I mean isn't it possible that we will achieve some unfathomable level of technological proficiency or have control over matter or have or have an understanding of the universe. It's such a deep level that we can violate all these things that we now consider laws. Like the laws of. Yeah. So the laws would have to be approximation as to some deeper laws. They're the einstein's theories of relativity. The best theories we have at the moment to have space and time, space time, thank god for einstein and well it wasn't general relativity actually 100 years old this year. So that is, it's amazing and I'm so the, the speed of light as a, as a fundamental part of the structure of space and time actually is central to that theory.

Speaker 2:          01:18:18       It's actually the thing that protects and cause and effect. So it protects if you like, the past from the present and the future. So it, it's built in in a very fundamental way to that theory. So you are right, it's in principle that. And it's a speed limit in that theory, by the way. And by the way, there are strange things happened as you approach the speed of light. For example, the theory says that time slows down thing that's traveling relative to us. So if someone there, the number I know is the number for the protons in the lhc. So the protons go 99 point nine, nine, nine, nine, nine, nine percent. The speed of light at that. So imagine one of those flying pastors now and you imagine it at a watch for it, suddenly the watch and you'd see it's what past 7,000 times more slowly our watch it and it would live 7,000 times more slowly than those.

Speaker 2:          01:19:07       So conversely, if it was watching us, um, it, it, it, that it would see the same effect. So you can, so you can move through time at different rates, essentially united starting this theory that the faster you go relative to somebody else, the slower your watch ticks. I got an idea. We combine your world and the kardashians and we shoot them in a space of the speed of light and they don't age well. That's exactly right. So exactly what you said. The cool thing about. That's what I was going to say. The thing about relativity is if you go at the speed of light, you don't age, no time passes. And that kind of pointed. You can't go at the speed of light unless you're massless. But that's kind of tough. But he'd be a message. You have to have you ever seen her ass? Good luck making that thing massless well, exactly. It's so be limited to travel below the speed of light, not just you. even if she only weighed only one gram in mass, she's such a lot more than that. Plus that's not a very aerodynamic object either. So we're launching that sucker.

Speaker 1:          01:20:08       Oh, that's right. It wouldn't matter in space because it's a vacuum. So you're all right today. We're dynamics still. So it's a fundamental thing. So. So if you, if you're going at that fundamental speed, there's no time, there's no distance. Actually there all the distances shrink to zero. So it's a, it's a long dress aids. It's a fundamental part of the structure of space and time. So it's always been possible. So you would need a different theory. So it's literally impossible change theory to go at the speed of light. Unless you're massless engage, you have to go at the speed of light. Ken, could you go just under the speed of light and then time would just slowed down so it wouldn't, you wouldn't, it wouldn't stop, but it would slow drastically. Yeah. Yeah. So as I said, 99 point nine, nine, nine, nine, nine, nine percent gives you a factor of 7,000.

Speaker 1:          01:20:54       Now here's the question, if you somehow or another we're able to go 99 point nine, nine, nine percent of the speed of light. What would happen in your perspective as far as time would? Would time, normal rate and their normal rate. Yeah. So you would age at a normal rate in your perspective? Yes. But back home, like if you came back around, if you went out into space and you went 10 years at the speed of light and you know, you, you came back, everything would change, but you'd be exactly the same. Yes. What would change for you though? Something has to change. So if the distances. So if you travel. So the other thing is let's talk about the protons in the lhc again. So they're their, they're their times past in 7,000 signs more slowly from the perspective of someone stood on the ground watching them go round, but from their perspective, time's going at the same rate, but something must change.

Speaker 1:          01:21:45       So what is it? The distance. So the lhc is no longer 16 miles in circumference, it's about now I know the number in metric, so it's four meters, so that's what is that in three feet or meters, like three point zero feet. Twelve feet? Yeah. So it's titled feet, so it's squashes and so distance is shrink from the perspective of the protons, so time passes at the same rate that the normal rate for them for on their watch, but the distances seem to seem to shrink or do shrink not seem to. They do deep. Are you concerned at all about artificial life? Are you concerned at all about the creation, the inevitable creation of something that in some way replicates independent thought and acts on its own accord? I always wonder if human beings are in some sort of a sense a technological caterpillar that's becoming a butterfly and we just don't realize it in all of our work. If you look at one of the things that human beings are absolutely fascinated with, whether or not it benefits us or not, we're fascinated with technological innovation. What we want faster computers, even if we don't even have applications for them, we want cars that goes zero to 60 in two seconds. We want everything to go quicker and better and we we, we don't get satisfied. Nobody ever looks

Speaker 4:          01:23:06       at computers and goes, we're good, we're good. We don't need a bigger laptop. We don't need a stronger hard drive. Everything seemed fine. Let's stop innovating on computers and move towards cancer research or no, we will never. We're never going to stop. And I always wonder if what? Whatever drives us. What if, what if is similar in some way to caterpillar building a cocoon, get about to give birth to this new thing. Totally unaware and that artificial life that our work with, whether it's code or whether it's electronics or whether it's three d printing, a combination of all those technologies coming together to create some new form of life and we don't think of life being possible in an electronic sense because we think of life as being cells and blood and all the things that we are, but is it possible that we might just be building the next thing that you know, we look at, well, we've only been alive for 200,000 years.

Speaker 4:          01:24:06       Yeah, but we might be shitting out the new version of life with our constant fascination with materialism. I mean, what is materialism ultimately, if not a push for innovation and technology? A big part of what materialism is, is keeping up with the jones' is getting the latest and greatest. Look at this. This guy has got a new tv. It sees your fucking brain. You know, it looks through your soul. You could play back your history. You know it, it gets a fingerprint it. You read it, it takes your dna and it shows you what your ancestors were doing. Two billion years ago, I mean, well there's another aspects

Speaker 2:          01:24:41       of r and d besides consumerism, isn't that the increased life expectancy, decreased child mortality, although of great things too. But I agree with you. I agree with you. I don't see any reason why I'm ai is in principle not possible because I think that although you know the research, we don't understand the brain, but I think it must, it must be an object that operates in accord with the laws of physics. He, I, I, I strongly suspect that our conscious experience is emergent, so it emerges. So there's a, there's an algorithm there. Very complex algorithm, but I don't see why it can't be simulated in a sufficiently powerful computer in principle. So I don't see why you can't have a conscious competer. I don't personally see why you can't. Therefore, if that's true, then you can given them and as you say, the, the, the rate of increase in computing power.

Speaker 2:          01:25:33       Is it rapid? We're not there yet. There is a project in, in europe are very big project to build a, a brain simulator. It's a long way off and you're talking about billions of dollars, but I'm at the moment, you know, as you say that 40 years ago, a billion dollars when you vote, you have an iphone, so. So yeah, I, I agree with you, and actually energy said three d printers a essentially seem to be the first step on the road to self replicating machine. So you've the computing power that can be intelligent and you've got a means of it being a replicator. Then I don't see why you can't build ais that replicate. And actually going back to the cosmology for a minute, one of the arguments against the existence of civilizations, more advanced civilizations, the nose in the milky way is that they would have done that.

Speaker 2:          01:26:24       And this is an argument from a mathematician called paul nyman and also a physicist called fermi. It's called the fermi paradox. That let's assume that let's, let's fast forward a ge said, let's fastforward our civilization. Ten thousand years, leT's say blink of an eye. Let's see. We'Ve only been around for. We've been around for less than that as a civilization. Let's aa 10,000. What are we going to look like? Will we have built self replicating ais? yeah. Unless there's some reason in principle why you count. So what do you do? You send those out there replicators. They can go to asteroids. Mine print three d print a version of themselves, go off again. they exponentiate they can crawl over the galaxy, exploring for free. They send them out, we see no evidence of those things. And they called von neumann machines. So it's one of the great.

Speaker 2:          01:27:11       You can either say that there's something in principle that stops you doing it. So actually there is something special about intelligence and you just can't with some reason why you can't build a computer that's artificially intelligent. I don't see why that would be the case. Oh, you could argue you can't build the self replicating, but you can because we are. We're replicators and we operate in accord with the laws of physics. So there. So there's a replicated or the reason we don't see them is because there aren't any civilizations that ever got to that level in the milky way. So we're the tip of the spear. No one what? We can't. We couldn't be the first. It's very difficult to see how we could be the first. Someone has to be the first. Why can't it be us? But because. Because the milky way has been around for the age of the universal use.

Speaker 2:          01:27:52       Say don't you know the earth is 6,000 years old, do you not go on with the [inaudible] side? So the timescales, we're talking billions of years really into planets, billions of years, but it has to happen in a one time was somewhere and then sudden. And if you get one wave of these ais away into space, then you can show using computer models with realistic assumptions about rocky power and things like that. you can cover the galaxy in on timescales of much less than a billion years. Actually million years less than that. So it's a. You can shoW that you can cover the galaxy and your von neumann probes. You're replicators in, you know, hundreds of thousands of years. Let's say a million, 2 million, 3 million, 10 million. It doesn't matter because we've got billions of years and yet we see no evidence of them, so, so what are we to make of that? Either there's something wrong with our arguments that we're putting forward that actually you can't build self replicating intelligent robots.

Speaker 2:          01:28:49       I don't see why not, but maybe there's something wrong with that. Or really civilizations are so rare that as you say, we are the first to get to that level, but that's interesting, isn't it? That that will be an interesting. I always think I'm a segue sentence to this, so imagine we're the only civilization in the galaxy. What a tremendous responsibility there is honors. Imagine what that knowledge should do to our political processes. The way that we think about ourselves, the way that we get on together. imagine how ridiculous it is to divide our little world or into countries and another little war every now and again, important nuclear missiles at each other, if in fact there's nowhere else in the milky way galaxy where anybody thinks anybody can look at the styles and think about and have these conversations. What a ridiculous way to behave. So I think the cosmology is gives a perspective which is not necessarily need to be humbling, it is humbling and that's perhaps a good thing, but it doesn't need.

Speaker 2:          01:29:49       You don't need to be depressed about it. It could be quite elating you say, well, with what we are according to the evidence and the data at the moment is almost indescribably special. Our, our tininess, our potential uniqueness, our insignificance in a cosmic scale actually makes us special because we're the only place. And so. So these, these ideas are worth pursuing I think because they make you think about these issues, doesn't it also point to our ego that we think that our biological processes any more important than the exploding sons that are required to create carbon life in the first place or, or any of the processes of the universe. The answer that I think is that you're right, that in a, in a, in a signal, in a completely logical sense, we no more important or less important than the stars themselves. You're right, which is natural objects.

Speaker 2:          01:30:43       But I would counter by saying that people look for meaning in the universe. People like to look for meaning gets this one thing that we've done since we began to look at the stars. The universe means something to me, doesn't it? It does. Meaning exists because it means something to us. So we know that it would be ridiculous to say the university is meaningless. It means something in my relatively our families, we have loved ones, etc. So the fact that that meaning might be emergent, it might appear from the laws of nature and it is almost certainly transient. Unless we build these self replicating machines, we will. We're not going to last forever as a civilization probably. so that to me, that doesn't in any way water down the significance of it. So I think again, cosmology can be, can be a poWerful, uh, aid to philosophical thoughts in this sense because you have to accept that there's meaning in the universe because it means something to us. I don't see why it has to be eternal. I don't see why there was that meaning, does it imply purpose? I don't think there's any purpose to the universe brings any point to our existence. But the fact that we exist at all is worth celebrating. You don't need to add anything else. In fact, you almost did it to me. You're devalued it. So why would you? This is remarkable. We emerged a single celled organisms probably before that. We

Speaker 3:          01:31:59       emerged some chemical reactions in in hydrothermal vents, probably down in the deep primordial oceans of ancient earth and over three point 8 billion years, we've come to the point where we can sit and think about the styles and have conversations like this. Is that not enough? can we just leave it there? Why does it have to be a point? There isn't a point. I don't think it's appalling to that, but it's worth celebrating. Well, it certainly is to us. To us, it's amazing, but you know, in a lot of ways isn't looking throughout the incredible cosmos for signs of life, like looking in a sea of parked mercedes benz for dust, like one of these cars must be fucking dusty. JuSt cleaned them. I'm going to find it. And you're ignoring the incredible mechanisms that are in front of you. There's an amazing technology. antilock brakes. Fucking 12 inch computer screens that ended up gauges anymore. The cars drive for you, they steer for you, they break for you, and we're like, one of these motherfuckers has dust on it just like us.

Speaker 3:          01:33:05       These planets, and we talked about our planet being four point 6 billion years. the universe is 13 point eight. We're looking for things that live 100 years were like just got to be one out there that sing songs somewhere. There's a better rapper than jay zed and he's out there in the universe. We've got to find him. We to find him. This is a search and we're ignoring steroids, gamma rays and better rap. We should read, write and masses and reasons. Again though, it doesn't take anything away from the fascination of just, you know, one of the beautiful things about being a human being is that we think about these things and that we can communicate and that you getting on this podcast can. You're planting all these seeds in people's minds that are making them consider these thoughts and now it spreads. And that's. That's one of the most fascInating things about the idea of intelligence is that intelligence begets intelligence. Intelligence sort of stimulates other intelligent. It's not simply, I mean, I think one of the reasons why you love educating is like, you know, how important this is for you and you want, you've seen the spark and people's eyes when you explain these things to them and you realize that that person might spread that spark somewhere else and this is really what this process is about in the first place, but it has meaning to us. But in the grand scheme of things, we're just exporting kardashians through the universe.

Speaker 3:          01:34:39       Well, we could make it stop by exploiting. They could see the resistance of exploring the kardashians makes people, you know, the new version of cosmos with neil degrasse tyson bag that gets out there to which said, that makes me optimistic actually, because I wouldn't have either. I think it's all together. He'd done

Speaker 2:          01:34:58       again. You know, I, I, I, I have to because carl sagan, great hero of mine. I mean, the fact that it would be doing them on the fox in a network, you know, a 13 episodes of it is. It is, it is. There are people out there who want to do it. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:35:14       Are most certainly and more so now than I think ever before and more so in the future. I think even though there is evidence that people are dumb as shit, there's still more evidence that people were super curious. I think it's just a, it's a numbers thing and if you spoon feed people the same thing over and over again, like you know, there's the argument for a limited network, especially american style or you could just sort of do it the bbc way, but the bbc way is beautiful and that sort of sandwiches, these brilliant shows in between other shows like, but not enough. There's not enough room. There's too many things out there now there's, you only have 24 hours in a day. There's no fucking way you're going to have enough programming. You just. Unless you have an infinite number of bbcs like he, you, you can't.

Speaker 3:          01:36:00       There's just too much shit going on. The world is too vast and that's not discounting anything that the bbc has ever done because one of my favorite networks, I'm like, I have this Congo series that I've probably watched a dozen times about the bbc, which is one of the most fascinating documentary documentaries, not just on a particular area of the world, but on life itself. Adapting, which is like the primary sort of theme to that, to that documentary where they're talking about these, these parts of the world that were changed really rapidly over a period of a couple thousand years where we used to be planes and then it became these dense rain forest and there's all these animals that are sort of trapped in this world like rhinos and plains animals. And Were. There was a piece on these, um, these type of antelope color diker that swims underwater a 100 yards. They can fucking swim. They eat fish. I mean, it's craziness if swimming and swimming as well, it's related to an antelope. but the idea is that you're talking about a very short period of time, a couple thousand years. That's had this rapid amount of change. These animals have had to adapt. That is very strange. New environment.

Speaker 2:          01:37:10       I think the, the, the, the, the, uh, inability of some people to understand that evolution and therefore react against it. It's all actually just, just religiously motivated. Most of it is, but some of it isn't. I think there's also a lack of understanding of the timescales involved and how fast animals can adapt and change. And what a powerful sieve, if you like evolution is you can see it richard dawkins often, right when he's writing beautifully about these things, writes about and look at domestic dogs and look how quickly the, the, the wolf got turned into these sort of ready for poodles to german shepherds to whatever It is. All those things that now that selection by humans, right? So we're selecting particular traits, but the environment and the interaction with other species is as powerful as that. It's as efficient as that. It's the environment is a very powerful selector of, of traits.

Speaker 2:          01:38:08       Then so you can see that evolution happens quickly. Speciation happens quickly. They're not quite with the dogs. They still the same species, but you can see how given a bit of time you're going to get the poodles and keep going on that line and get the wolves and keep going on that line and eventually you're going to get things that look so different that if you separate them and don't let them into breed that you're going to end up with something that can't breed with that anymore and that's kind of the definition of a new space is one of the definitions of a new species. So you can see how It can happen, but I think one of the problems is the timescales are not understood. When you talk about thousands of years, that's quite a long time. Ten thousand years, a long time, 200,000 years. You go back that long and we didn't exist as a species. We weren't there so. So, you know, 100,000 years Is a hell of a long time.

Speaker 4:          01:38:59       Yeah. Too, too long too. I think in our mind to process like we can kind of process a lifetime, you know, we can process birth to a hundred years while he lived to be 100. Wow. A lot of what? A lot of things that guy must've seen. But to process 100 of those. Yeah, 100 hundreds. How about a thousand? How about 100,000? Uh, yeah, It's, it's just too much going on. There's too much change that a long time. Do you subscribe to the idea, and I've heard this debated about that human intelligence may be in some form exponential and that all the knowledge that people have acquIred mean obviously not like in a physical sense like you're, you're, you're, you're not born with an understanding of math and language and all these things are learned, but that intelligence may somehow another be not just passed on from generation to generation, but enhanced by life's experiences and that the genes that are transmitted from you to your children may be in fact more powerful than the genes you were given and that as you've lived your life and acquired information and knowledge and understanding and whatever, whatever intelligence means, you know, whatever sort of intangible idea intelligence truly is, but that this mind power, this, this, this accumulation over the 200,000 years that human beings have existed and people breeding and getting to this point, that this might exponentially be growing and expanding.

Speaker 4:          01:40:28       Is that, is that in any way possible that we're, I,

Speaker 2:          01:40:32       I'm not an expert on genetics? I don't think so. I don't think there's any evidence as far as I know that our iq average iq to change much over the last few hundred years, certainly. Um, so. So as far as I know, that's not the way that it works. There's the you need, I think some kind of selector that would say you'd have to take the most intelligent levels by some measure, let's say. And, and have them be more successful at producing offspring than the people who are less intelligent. You'd have to do,

Speaker 4:          01:41:11       but isn't it? You need some mechanism. Why haven't they done like those do the sperm banks were really super intelligent people and like the kids that come out of it or smartest shit.

Speaker 2:          01:41:21       Oh well that I could imagine that might be true. I think the correct answer scientifically, if you don't know the link between, we don't know enough about the genetics and the genome, the human genome to say which bits are producing brain power. If research they. Well, what is it that you know, which genes are really intelligent gene or set of genes and I think that that's not known I think is the right thing to say, but I emphasize it's not my field, but it must have something to ponder. When you think about evolution, you think about genetic knowledge and that the like certain things that I would perhaps argue with that the idea that. I know there's some interest in this, but I think that the standard answer is that the, the knowledge let's say, so I become educated that, that I think the standard answer is that that would not have any impact on the jeans that I passed to my offspring. I don't think there's any known mechanism to, to have knowledge in imprinted, so back into your genetic code such that it can be sent onto your thing, but you know, you may have seen otherwise. I, I'm not aware of any research. It's hard to like look into a kid's head and find out exactly where all the information is coming from. Right? Yeah. But I don't think there's a known. Well, there isn't a known a known. Was that just something we have to

Speaker 4:          01:42:41       tri caster just freeze up on us. People at home right now are freaking the fuck out. We were just about to get to the bottom of this. I'm instincts like humans have certain instincts, right? Like there's people have fears like genetically sort of predisposed fears to like scary dogs, animals. I mean we know you don't have to have a dog bite you to know the dogs fucking terrifying. Like what is that like when a dog is growling? Like kids are afraid of teeth, they're afraid of big teeth and monsters. Like even children that grow up in cities, they're afraid of monsters. And the idea behind that that I've heard, I think it was rupert sheldrake there, was talking about this. He was saying that it may very well be that these memories of being preyed upon by like cats like that. These genetic memories that are from our ancient, ancient, ancient ancestors. When we didn't have homes and we were living in trees and we were. Things were running after us trying to eat us and these ideas are passed down from animal to animal and eventually human to human.

Speaker 2:          01:43:40       I don't think it's as far as I know, there's no solid evidence that suggests that things you experience as a, as a, as an adult or child, the experiences themselves can be can be passed on the other than the verbally to them when they're listening to your stories that I'm not aware of. Any mechanism that's known that would allow that to happen,

Speaker 4:          01:44:02       haven't they've proven that genetics, epigenetics and the in some some memes like even useless ones like racism can be transmitted from parent to child. Not that I'm aware of, but I don't know. Obviously not my field of study either. just a. I'm just fascinated by the idea that we don't totally understand all of the. All the ingredients of the mind and that's certainly true. That's certainly true, but I'm not aware of. I don't know. I doubt it because I can't see a mechanism. Brown butter? No. Are we back up, jamie? What's going on? Tri caster froze. Oh, what a piece of shit that we paid $15,000 for. How dare you try castor people? Meanwhile, we should probably be excited that someone figured that fucking thing out. You think it might have to do with the box and it gets heated up. I have no idea. No. Just shit out on us. Yeah, most likely, right? How dare they? One of the things that was proposed that I read recently was that black holes aren't real. Is that nonsense? Is that like one person's controversial idea? Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:45:12       Yeah. Basically, it's not necessarily nonsense just because it's one person's idea, but it's likely to be nonsense. I haven't seen that particular theory, so I don't know. I mean the. We have a lot of good evidence for the existence of black holes. Not least theY predicted there prediction of einstein's theory of general relativity and they're there. They're on solid theoretical ground and we've seen the signatures of them. So for example, the object at the center of the milky way galaxy, we know what the masses of that object, because we've measured the orbits of stars very close to it. We know what the maximum size of the object can be because it can be bigger than the orbits of the styles that go around it, and so we measure its mass. I think it's about 4 million times the mass of the sun and the only way that our current laws of physics allow such an object to exist and be so small is for it to be a black hole. So there's good evidence that black holes are around, but you can always say, well, you know, we've never been to one. They're very hard to photograph because they're black, but you can, but you can photograph the stuff that falls into them. You can see the signature of stuff fallen into them, which we do

Speaker 4:          01:46:18       and they've, they've. What was it like? It was somewhere in the two thousands. They figured out that at the center of every galaxies of supermassive black hole that is like one half of one percent of the mass, the galaxy or something along those lines. We

Speaker 2:          01:46:30       think so. As I said, I think off the top of my head, I think it's about 4 million times the mass of the sun, so the larger galaxies would have a larger black hole. I'm not sure if it's that. It's not well understood actually because he's not well understood how galaxies form in the first place and what role the supermassive black holes having the formation of the galaxies, so that's a real active area of research. Actually a good question.

Speaker 4:          01:46:55       The thing that I was reading was there were debating the possibility that inside each one of these supermassive black holes, so like there being hundreds of billions of galaxies, each one of them with a black hole in the center of it, a supermassive black hole in through that black hole is a whole nother universe with hundreds of billions of galaxies. Each with black holes go through that whole hundred billion more galaxies. Each with black holes go through that hundred dollars, billion more that

Speaker 2:          01:47:22       each galaxy itself literally as a portal to a completely different universe. We, I mean we don't have a problem with black holes, is that their prediction of einstein's theory? One of the earliest predictions, there's a thing called the swatch child metric, which describes black holes. It was done I think in 1915 or 16 years, right as soon as relativity was published is when they're showing that these things could exist, um, but uh, we don't. The theory itself Breaks down and then the theory of black holes, the general relativity, which is the theory that explained einstein's theory rejects so predicts their existence, but it doesn't. The characteristics of black holes, the physics inside black holes is not understood. We don't know. Our theories don't work. We need what's called a quantum theory of gravity to make progress there. So that's the unification of quantum theory and relativity and general relativity, which is what string theory is an attempt to do, but we don't know whether that's the right theory.

Speaker 2:          01:48:24       So, so, so we will see this is the edge of knowledge. So we don't know. We don't know what we don't know how to describe black holes. Probably we have a theory that's capable of describing. We can describe the edge of this thing about an event horizon and all that stuff that works. That's not a problem in einstein's theory, so the idea that if you have a sufficiently den subject, then there's a region around it. I'm out of which light contest scape because space and time are to curb for light to get out. That's, that's fine. The theory describes that properly, but when you go, when you start asking questions about what happens at the center of a black hole, a singularity, that very idea, it's called a singularity tells you their infinities in the theory. The theory is doing things is infinitely dentist. It's infinitely small.

Speaker 2:          01:49:07       It's, well, no, it won't be it. We don't have infinities in general in nature other than perhaps the size of the university as you say. It's so, so, um, so there's something going on there, but we don't have the physical theory. We don't have the tools to describe it. It's an active area of research. So I don't know. He's a good answer in science. Right? And so speculations fun, but, but ultimately, you know, we're talking about, we're talking about a regime of nature, uh, which, which, which are current theories and not capable of describing with any authority. And that's, that's the inside of a black hole. We were talking about this before the podcast, the difference between the way you present your shows and the bbc and the way you're sort of forced to present your shows on the science channel. And this was one of the very issues as a little bit, I mean that's dealing with unknowns, dealing with what you're describing, things like black holes or like the event horizon of a black hole that there are points in time where you have to say we don't know yet.

Speaker 2:          01:50:13       Yeah. That we were talking earlier and I said because at the moment we're a cyber series in the uk called human universe, which has been on in the uk, um, five episodes one hour long. So we also make them with science channel and besides channels one hour, it's 43 minutes because they have adverts, right? Commercials. So fine, that's the way. So we've got to take 17 minutes out. But also we have some interaction about, well how do we nuance things for the. Because you'll do things for a british market that will be different in american market. And one of my favorites recently was that one of the programs is about this multiverse that we just talked about earlier. The fact that may be an infinite number of universes. The universe may have been around forever. There may be no beginning to the universe, all speculative, right?

Speaker 2:          01:50:57       Then they have it. So what does that mean? It means that our existence is inevitable. We have to exist in an infinite universe and we are because we have to be. So there's no purpose to our existence. There is no universal meaning to our existence. We are, because we have to be an in the, in the british virgin, I say. So to the camera. How does that make you feel? And the wonderful thing is nobody knows this is new. Physics is right at the edge. It's speculative, but we're beginning to address it with the data and the theories. So we need theologians and philosophers and artists and novelists. We need to discuss these things. What does it mean for us? If we're at our existence is inevitable and we're not special, but yet we may still be valuable. It doesn't mean I don't know. So the last thing I say in a british version is so, so what do you think say to the audience, and I think it's beautiful and it's filmed over tokyo over tokyo skylight I think is beautiful.

Speaker 2:          01:51:50       But I did get a note from the science channel saying, well the thing is that this is not the style on the. So we, we tend to try and leave the viewer with some concrete things. So. So can you tell them what it means for the song and what the meaning of life, the meaning, the great existential question of what does it mean to exist? you want me to answer that? Yes, that'd be better for, for our audience. It's like, well I really, I'm a bit. So I said, you know, what? Can you tell me what to say? Perhaps I'd love it if. Look if science channel, if you know the meaning of life, then we tell me and I'll gladly say on the blog, I don't know. So it was kind of interesting. There's that difference in style, but I loved it that they said, can we do.

Speaker 2:          01:52:37       We really do want you to broadcast the meaning of life undiscovered. Nine o'clock, because I can see how it'd be great sell, you know, undiscovered tonight after sharks, you know, whatever they put on extra shot, we were going to do the meaning of life with professor Brian Cox. Brian cox will tell you what it means to exist for your existence, to be inevitable in a possibly infinite cosmos. Find out at nine I either. So it would be good. It wouldn't be completely subjective. What life means to you doesn't you know jamie as a differences that need. This is what we do do. I do do in the series I. This is what it's about. It's a love letter to the human race, human universe. It's a. You see that? Certainly if you buy the one hour version, I don't know how it's gonna pan out in 43, but if you, if you get the one which you can buy from good retailers on the internet, it turns Out you need a.

Speaker 2:          01:53:26       It's not an itunes at the moment, but you need it. You need a 10 ati blu ray player. I will say you do that, not all us dvd players play 10, eight year. I content your plates and aup content, technical stuff. One of them is called interlaced and one of them is called progressive scan. There's virtually no difference except that in europe we tend to. So some of your blue ray players in America will play it and some of them won't. It turns out I just found out they, it's the one that the under blue ray, you can buy it. But um, and I encourage you to because it's wonderful. But um, but, uh, but so, so there's something so, but it'll be unsigned channel anyway in a few months, but it will cut down a bit. But the, but the central message is this, that it we talked about earlier, the, the, it leads you, I think to value the human race.

Speaker 2:          01:54:10       So there's like we filmed in Ethiopia, which I love. I always love filling in Ethiopia because we were in the rift valley filming this story about the emergence of humans from the rift valley. And then we filmed in some I call the danica depression, which is one of the, other than death valley, you advise with death valley often for the hottest place on earth, but it's far more barren and death valley. So if in northern Ethiopia on the eritrean border there are volcanoes and it's bleak and, but there's a tribe of people call the fr that lived there and they fascinating and I stayed with them a few years ago and they don't have a concept for example, of possessions because they don't have anything. They just live on these volcanoes, in this wasteland. So. So they say if you put something down like a something, then they will legitimately pick it up and they'll.

Speaker 2:          01:54:54       And they'll say, well I'm going to use it for a while. So when your film crew you kind of, there's no cultural idea. They're not stealing, they're not taking stuff. They don't have that idea because they don't have anything. So they leave the camera, they might get your camera. And we had some guards with those from the for tribe, but it's a bit dangerous there. And he had an ak 47, this guy and he sat there with his ak 47 and then we woke up one day and we had a mountaineer with us. So he got one of his mountaineering ropes attached to his ak 47 and he sat there now with this rope. So the guy said to me, she should I ask for it back because I know number one, it's attached to an ak 47, which gives him the advantage. We didn't believe we get into an argument. And number two, it's fascinating. I have no idea of possession. But the reason I started saying that was because we were filming. We talk about meaning in life and we said to this man who was called

Speaker 1:          01:55:44       a, you didn't allie a guy at if our tribe, small men, probably four foot tall old. And we said, we're talking to you about this through a translator. And he said to us on camera, he said, you said your, your, your eyes have your age, but your ears have your father's age, your, your is here the past and your eyes. See the president. And this is the way you should live, and I just thought what a beautiful thing that came out of this man, and so we put that in the series just in subtitled it and left it there because it's full of little. Just people celebrating those people is something you'd never see. You don't think there are people who live on volcanoes in northern Ethiopia that say wonderful things about your ears. I've been your father's age and your your eye in the past being used through your ears to manipulate an informed the way you behave in the present.

Speaker 1:          01:56:35       Beautiful deep thoughts. So we tried to fill the series with those things as well. So it's a mixture of cosmology and the celebration of the wonder of human existence. The diversity of human thought. It was beautiful stuff in there. A love letter to the human race and why not? Because we deserve it. What we're so adaptabLe. The idea that people can live like that with no possessions the same time where people will live in a world that the r one, one of our biggest issues is that people live to accumulate possessions. And the idea of materialism is it's, it's like it very much like you were talking about the 17 year old boy that only pays attention to video games that becoming obsessed with anything, whether it's becoming obsessed with objects, becoming obsessed with ideas. Hey, we're human beings, we, we, we are so flexible for so flexible in how we can exist as a culture or as a community that our ideas are so rigid that people have to be this way.

Speaker 1:          01:57:33       And you know, you can't run around on the Internet saying that there's no meaning to life when jesus, his name is being broadcast right now on christian ministries all throughout the world. They understand what the meaning of Life is all about. Brian cox, you are the one who is ignorant to the ways of the lord. And I do think that the, what I found is that travel. Why would I, because I filmed in, I just fill it in. I'm actually freeing for the monkey cage free monkey age because because we're doing the show is in their life. You have to have a different kind of us visa. Right? So, so and, and the visa you have to put, where were you been in the last five years? How many countries have you visited within the last five years and it at 38 I'd been to, to fill in these things. 30 eight countries. I thought, wow. I didn't know that. That's a lot. You know. And what's interesting, what I found it really honestly is that when you go to Ethiopia or India or Japan out into the wilds and these places, people tend to be relatively. Well, everyone I've met is first of all but interested in stuff. So through the translator with the tribe, we talk about the styles and I say as I've got stars and they're interested so that they don't, they've never been to school. They

Speaker 2:          01:58:42       have their own education, they're up, they're learning about how to live in a volcanic wasteland, but yet they're interested and the things they're interested in common I find. And I genuinely am anyone that I found uncomfortable, I was uncomfortable with. I haven't met any of the maniacs that we consider, we think of as in the world, you know, we think well it's okay here, you know, in, in north America or in europe or something, we're okay, but there's all these wild people out there, you know, something I know. I just haven't seen any evidence of that. And so that's part of human universe. It's just trying to put these impressions. Yeah, they believe different stuff. So you might think, you know, like you said, there's the people who say, well jesus is the way, but then you'll go to India and you'll find that there are people who are hindus who strange beliefs towards, you know, ganesh, the blue elephant garden v, they're part of that fabric of understanding the universe.

Speaker 2:          01:59:37       And I find it wonderful actually. It tells you something, the, the, the, there are some things that are cultural and some things that are not religions, cultural. You go different places, you have different religions. That's not to say, although I don't have any interest, any interest in religion, I always said people ask me quite a lot, you know? Do you really been gardens? I know, no, but I don't really even think about it until I get asked. I would've never just stumbled across that concept to myself. I, yeah. I get asked a lot now because I do science on television. I know he said the same thing, which is I don't really. I'm not really interested. I don't think about it. It's all. Is that upset anybody? Well, kind of because I don't want to be dismissed. I'm not trying to be missy and they just talk about your own personal interests.

Speaker 2:          02:00:14       Does that, does that upset you? You're, you're. What I'm saying is I'm just reaffirming what you're saying. You're just talking about your own personal interests, like why do, why does your personal lack of an interest in something upset people, but it seems to right? Well, it can do because I think it says central part of the framework they use to explain the world and meeting and all these questions that we're discussing. We should. Difficult questions and I think don't have answers, right? I don't eat it. It's a complicated question. What does it mean to be alive? And as we said, it obviously means something personally, but I don't. These are complicated question, but I think what's interesting is you go around the world and you see that these questions are common and people think about them in wherever they are, wherever their level of education, they have some framework for understanding that, but there are also commonalities are large.

Speaker 2:          02:01:03       The, the curiosity about the stars is something that you see everywhere you see the curiosity about the origins of the universe and there are stories which are different all over the world. All in my view and in the human universe view with an equally valid, right? They're, they're, they're all worth it. I don't consider it from them. I think they're interesting. They're interesting responses to nature. I think it's these people that live around this volcano. How do they survive? What are they eating? Like they have goats. Um, the, they managed to feed on the Limited tiny amounts of limited vegetation that's there, very little water. So they're very careful with the water, um, but they, they've developed this way of living there. They're remarkable, tough, really tough bunch of people. How many people live up there? I don't know actually how big the font is, but he's one of the Ethiopia is very tribal and it goes into Eritrea as well.

Speaker 2:          02:01:58       So it's in this area, at the top of the rift valley. It's called the triple afar junction, which is a tectonics plate tectonics. It's where all the volt vulcanism at the top of the rift is. So it's the generator of the rift valley, you'd be like, is beautiful actually. Is it an idea? Because this is the cradle of humanity. So, so, so you've got this is, I find it a magical place actually. Ethiopia for that reason. And it said I recommend it actually had addie sandberg is a beautiful city. He said high altitude city. Um, so Ethiopia tend to think of, especially if you're a kid of my generation, you think in live aid and the big famine in Ethiopia, you think it is dusty place and it is in some areas, but actually the, the capital, it's a very green countries is high altitude, quite pleasant city as some african cities when they're very hot and they did.

Speaker 2:          02:02:42       It can be very unusual for people like us from places are not dusty and hot and but at is not like that actually. And I was and I, I find this an idea when I go there, I like the idea that because you, you kind of almost know that we came from there. Somehow you come armed with this knowledge. This is, that we were all related to someone who lived here in, in and around adis abba in the rift 200,000 years ago were all related to someone who lived there. And we wandered out from there. I find that a powerful thought actually, and he dismisses, you know, the great deal of talk of differences amongst us. but actually you go to Ethiopia, you, you realize very soon that we're not far back because you said you trace your generators, parents, father, grandfather back, right back. You don't go far back before you get to an ethiopian. She's quite wonderful. I think so. It's so pretty

Speaker 4:          02:03:36       active enhancing to to see people in this day and age. I was watching a documentary on people that live in the amazon that are barely contacted by the western world. They sort of, they made have like american underwear or something that someone gives them. But other than that, like you know, these people have been living essentially very similar to the way they've been living thousands of years ago and they're getting by. They're fine and it just, it makes you realize like how, how this world that we live in right now that we think everybody has to have an email address, everybody has to at least have some form of public transportation. No, they don't. You don't. You don't have to have anything. These people all walk around, they walk around in the jungle and they live and they've been living like. And They know what to eat, you know what not to eat and they know what to avoid and they have babies and their culture continues and they don't even write things down and they'd been living like that for a long time. And they're people just like you and just like me.

Speaker 2:          02:04:33       Yeah. With the same. I find the same level of curiosity and interest is, it's kind of sometime more so. Well. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, exactly. So it's very interested in that perspective.

Speaker 3:          02:04:46       The people that you contacted in Ethiopia, how many, how many are in their group, the ones that you were in contact with that?

Speaker 2:          02:04:53       Um, maybe I'd be guessing 100 or so in this kind of. Do they have a writteN history? No, no. Oral history. Yeah. So these are stories passed down from generation, so they're great storytellers. Wow. The results in these isolated tribes. I mean obviouslY Ethiopia is a fascinating country because it's one of the few countries in africa that in an ancient country, I mean they, they, they're, they're, they're in biblical times. You know, they've got these myths about when you get to our this, they say we've got the uh, the ark of the covenant running cathedral in adis. Then you say, can I see it? And they go, no, but iT's there. But I like the mythology. The mythology is that the queen of sheba was up there and stole it, I think, and came back and brought it back selling author of king solomon and solomon wouldn't.

Speaker 2:          02:05:42       So yeah, so you've got this. It's all intertwined. It's the fact that they're, they're written history. The central ethiopian written history is, is, is in the biblical, in its, in its spanish ancient Egypt. They were part of that thing that Egypt and, and, and in Ethiopia and then into jerusalem, those areas palestine and then out to you that, that, that, that thousand year old 2000 year old history is part of that country. Very centrally part of it. Whereas usually in africa, you know, you get countries that were divided up and they came after the second world war and he post-imperial things. But Ethiopia is a real, a more grounded place in history. So it's a fascinating place. What is the area that's supposed to contain the ark of the covenant that cathedral allegedly, um, in, in this, as I say, I wasn't allowed to see it, so I'm very tied that exist, but only people were supposed to be like looking at it. How many, how nobody argues with this myth.

Speaker 3:          02:06:42       So is it like al capone's vault where like it took joe geraldo rivera to break down the wall before we realized there was nothing in it. I mean, is there like a room that no one goes into? I think other than the priests and things really, I think that's because someone wants to build the cathedral in and obviously the queen of shiva stolen in the first place. So it's not there anymore. It is let from jerusalem. Oh, and brought it to Ethiopia. Yes. Right. And took it down to Ethiopia. Managing if it is something that, some technological object from a forgotten time, you under it and go, oh yeah, you know, what, stop do you remember? Um, there was, there was some work that was done on ancient batteries where they've, uh, they believe that some, some of the artifacts they found like egyptian pyramids perhaps might have functioned in

Speaker 2:          02:07:36       a very similar way to a modern battery. I saw that. Uh, yeah. I mean it's possible I suppose. And we, again, we talked about timescales. It's three and a half thousand for my fans and years. You know, the, the earliest pyramids. I think so. Um, yeah, we, we don't know. We know quite a lot about the, the egyptians. Again, it's about human universe, especially my monkey cage. And I'll talk about giving university as well because we, we found um, my wife actually started learning. Egyptians were just interested in hieroglyphics. She just got some classes and the literature from ancient Egypt is fascinating. You're talking about three year, 2000 bc is things that have been written down and the earliest I locked in, I want it in the book of human universe, which you can get in the us, I should say. I went into, look, I want dailies literature.

Speaker 2:          02:08:24       What is it? And it's basically the, one of the earliest things I could find was basically monty python's parrot sketch because it's, this is a complaint. And he said, I wish to register a complaint. It's a piece of papaya, iris. And it's a complaint about, um, I think it was the, the, the, the, the coffin. It was a, as a coffee manufacturer who had supplied this coffee and there was the wrong size and it was kind of a bit of a ripoff. And this person said, I'm complaining about this, I want to send it back. This is terrible. I want my money back. And they'd say, well, you can have two coffIns instead. And he, I don't want a voucher. I want my money. And so you see this was wonderful, is it's a modern voice that echoes down the ages from ancient Egypt that they, most of them are either admin.

Speaker 2:          02:09:09       Things about my garden was nicked a bit of my garden. You moved the fence in the night or something like that. All complaining about some piece of commerce like this is, I've been ripped off by the shopkeeper and it's terrible and it's wonderful. But then they're also poems, fantastic poems, there's one about a woman talking to her husband and under the awareness, the husband talking to him, and so you go through and he's saying, why did you leave me? Why didn't you love me? It's quite touch in a meeting. And then you realize towards the end that this, this, this, um, woman died, she's dead, but he's still talking to it like that because the egyptians thought that, you know, she'd moved on, conscious, a conscious decision to go into the afterlife. And so there's this kind of bitterness being expressed and this really moving piece of poetry and then you realize that it's 4,000 years old us, you know, it's wonderful actually. So you found, we haven't changed at the point that you find from this old literature, what will the, one of the oldest pieces of human language was the cuneiform right from somewhere? I read this one thing that was, there was a passage they were talking about that was about divorce. Yeah, iT was about marriage and divorce. There was something along like, um, uh, I forget what it was like a sort of a very short poem about divorce, about marriage

Speaker 1:          02:10:34       and uh, you know, for your relief or for your pleasure. Divorce was very bizarre, like the concept of two people uniting by ritual existed six, whatever, five, 6,000 years ago and they wrote about it in these little scratches, you know, the, the cuneiform which looks like ancient nails with a flat top and a that points down and then a certain pattern they've been able to figure out that it means some form, some language that you can kind of attempt to translate to our modern languages in a weird, clunky, you know, have you ever read like Russia, like the russian translations from russian to english. It's so bizarre because their language is so alien to us. It's so different that the way they use pronouns and the subtext and all the different aspects that we sort of take for granted about language don't translate correctly. Yeah. Yeah. And you think you mentioned that hieroglyphics.

Speaker 1:          02:11:33       Yeah. Could I like the fact that the voice is so familiar. We haven't changed the library of alexandria man, the burning of the library of alexandria, if we had never taken place and we could somehow or another go back and read all the shit that they knew about construction methods and how they built those things and what was the purpose behind them and what was the significance of the astronaut astrological alignment. Like what, what were they doing, why were they, what they were doing was so insane in comparison to the greater some of humanity. Like if you look at humans, 2,500 bc and then you look at Egypt, you like jesus christ. What the fuck happened here? How did you guys figure this shit out that no one else anywhere near w w was anywhere close to this level of sophistication. Modern construction. The second thing you can take from this, because if you look at ancient Egypt, so of course if you go to some of the temples down there on denial and look, so in particular, it's just astonishing achievement.

Speaker 1:          02:12:36       I you that. You look at Greece, you look at the greek literature, and then you look at the library of alexandria, which the knowledge was lost because the barbarians came and burn the thing down and you realize that civilizations rise and fall and knowledge can be lost, and the the, the, the romans, I suspect though they were eternal as a civilization, they were continuing to progress the greeks before. they haven't felt that. The egyptians thought that they didn't. we think that now, and it's interesting to reflect, I think on the fact that you don't have to make progress. The progress is in your own hands so you can choose to make progress. They didn't choose to make progress for various reasons. They stopped making progress and they vanished and knowledge vantage with a lot of the time and I think it's a lesson for us. We could do that. You know, we, we just maybe we've got into this position now with our technology were just, it just won't go like that, but only we can take it for granted. Which I think goes back to right back to the start of the conversation

Speaker 2:          02:13:32       about how do we, how do we say to people, you know, the, the, this is a remarkable thing that we've done, but it don't take it for granted. He's not just going to tick along while you guys sit there and watch sports all the time, right? That's not the way that you make progress. Somebody got to do something and we've all got to support the people. Even if you don't want to do it, then support the people that want to do it. So you look at the, you know, I was, I was filming with them on friday for a thing I'm doing in britain with a rusty spigot who's an apollo nine c test flu, the lunar module and apollo nine in 1968. First test flight of it in earth orbit before they went to the moon in july of that year. And um, and uh, so he, we landed on the moon actually in India.

Speaker 2:          02:14:17       We were in a simulator is terrific and he showed me how to do it and it's fantastic. But you look at nasa, the investment in nasa at that time, it was never more than four percent of the federal expenditure and actually it was often less than that, so it wasn't particularly expensive on average, maybe about three percent of federal expenditure, but it laid the foundation I could argue for american technological dominance in the last quarter of the 20th century because for example, the, the average age of the engineers in the nasa mission control when apollo 11 landed on the moon was below 30, below 30 years old. Those engineers. So what happened to them after the apollo program, they went out to work for boeing and you know, microsoft bell labs, bell labs or lockheed martin or whoever it is, all these people. So you get this explosion in, in technological achievement, in economic growth in America is a terrific place to be a because in, in many ways because of the growth that happened in those 30 or 40 years since apollo and, and, but that was because of a conscious investment led by, you know, kennedy's great speech and also inspired by the cold war, et cetera.

Speaker 2:          02:15:24       There's many reasons why I did it, but ultimately that investment paid vast dividends. You look at nasa today and the investment is way down, so the ambition that the America had to go to the moon because it's there and to beat the russians yet, but to do it and then that ambition seems to be missing to me and I looked, I, I, I looked to this country actually because I think it is the country know the country could have done that. They get no, the country could. Gun moon will go. I think before this decade is out, we'll go and they hadn't flown anyone in space. When kennedy made that speech, you hadn't flown anyone in space and you say, within 10 years I'm going to walk on the moon. That's an american thing to do. I think this is part of what's great about this country and I regret the fact that that doesn't seem to be there at the moment, and going back to why I started saying that the, the, the idea that progress is progress is comes to the bold, right?

Speaker 2:          02:16:18       I would say so the idea that it will just come, they will just make progress and is not necessarily right. In fact, history tells us it's wrong, so you've got to have, I believe bold visions and visionary leaders and leaders are just say, well, this is not a great deflection of resources. It was, as I say, it was always less than three, four percent of federal expenditure, but it's a great reflection of national will and it's a great generator of fsc, of engineers and scientists who are inspired by those things and trained in that process. That guy into the economy make the economy better. There's a study that suggested it was a 14 to one return on every dollar invested in apollo by 1980 and people can argue about the um, the 10 to was 14 to one. Was it 22? One is the return to the private sector or return to the government that gdp into, in just into wealth generated.

Speaker 2:          02:17:12       So, so each one made tang each one of those dollars generating at least 10 and maybe 20 in a decade. And it's obvious how it did it. Because look at those young engineers and look at the technologies that were developed for a follow. Someone said to me at nasa ames up in san francisco, virtually virtually every technology and commercial aviation today got invented there in at nasa ames. Actually most of it, so, so you can point to one place and go, that's where everything I take for granted when I get in an aircraft came from that almost directly. Do you think it's because of the, the, the ending of the cold war or the lack of competition with Russia? There's. We were on top, so we just got soft. There was no need to keep pushing and pressing. There wasn't an adversary. There wasn't this technological adversary that's out there that gives people the motivation to continue to invest.

Speaker 2:          02:18:03       Forty percent of the gross domestic product or whatever, you know, whatever the. The amount of money we need. I don't know. It seems. I have to look at britain, so I talk about my country, which did the big thing around the world and then declined. It doesn't run the world anymore. Handed it over to you guys. You guys had a little island. He ran it out of an island. It's pretty dope. Yeah. We have a big ass continent. We set off in the wrong place. Did it out of Rhode Island. It's kind of smaller than California. Yeah, it was pretty crazy for awhile. not bad, but it seems to me that what we lack is the. These things are not expensive. In fact, they're vital. They generate money, so it seems to me it's leadership. It's visionary leadership by inspiration. Yeah, and it doesn't take it well.

Speaker 2:          02:18:52       I was gonna say it doesn't take much clear. It took a kennedy, I think. I mean that speech. He's a remarkable speech. Rallies a nation beyond something, but it's not a particularly large diversion of resources. That's the point and certainly given the what you get back, it seems to me the investment in r and d in science and technology and education, these are the things that formed the foundation of our future. Absolutely. And everybody agrees with that and I get very involved. I get involved in politics in britain, but not party politics, but this lobbying for this, spend money on the young, spend money on education system, spend money on inspiration, make sure that there's a generation of these great engineers and scientists that America is currently well leading in. Absolutely. um, and make sure that they're still there and make sure. And how do you get them?

Speaker 2:          02:19:38       How do you inspire them? I don't want kids to want to be a singer's actually, particularly annex x factor. I don't want them to be famed. When there was a survey done recently I think where they said to the lower school kids what you want to be when you grow up and, and, and a lot of them said, famous, famous. What do you mean famous? You want to walk on the moon? Don't you want to. Do you want to invent the world's fastest computer? Don't do you want it? What do you mean famous? You've got to be famous for something not famous because you want a talent show. We go back to the pole. Can kardashians? I'd never seen the cardassians by the way. I don't know who the hell they are and thank god I don't because I don't know. We don't, I don't think we have them in britain that maybe we do, but they get over there.

Speaker 2:          02:20:13       Do they get over that? We'd done it, I'm sure, but I want to pick on that lot. I mean they're doing what they do. Right. But the point is you don't want to be one of those without being disrespect. Maybe they, they're having a good time, find insult people and then at the same time people kind make their make their way, you know, and do well and they're not criminals. They're not evil people. They're not. Those is what do you want to aspire to be as, as a kid? What do you want to aspire to be? And it's true. They're in their sixties. They wanted it to be neil armstrong, uh, or one of the engineers in mission control. And that's a government government has. I know it's kind of unfashionable in some circles, but government sets the, sets the direction in the, it has to.

Speaker 2:          02:20:52       It's, you know, companies can do it as well. So you have the big companies like apple and google and so people do aspire to work with those companies, but I think the grand direction of civilization is set by set by governments and visionaries and and, and it's not expensive, but it's terrifically expensive not to do it. For governmenTs to the idea of government is really been hijacked in this country and come apart. Money being catalytic, I don't know. You know, it depends what you mean by government and big government, small government, special interest groups and the

Speaker 4:          02:21:24       law. Like it's just too much money involved. The complaints being there's legal, like absolutely legal corruption in this country. Like we're giant corporations are allowed to invest enormous sums of money into candidates that will, once they get into office, you do the bidding of these corporations manipulate laws, move things around, make things easier for these corporations to manipulate our society. That's a realIty and that's very unfortunate. But I think that's a reality that's also being a roading or eroding rather by technology. I think people understanding the mechanisms involved in government is making them want to change those mechanisms. People pushing for ideas lIke being able to vote online. This is like people were really frustrated by this oil. How come I can bank online? how come you can deal with the entire world's economy through computers and the internet, but you can't vote? How come is it because you don't want it to be that easy for people to give their opinion, people to vote because

Speaker 1:          02:22:26       the world of the internet and the world of of actual voting there too, there's a big gap between them. There's a big gap that would instantly shift right over if you were allowed to vote online and these people this, oh, there's problems with that. Oh, corruption, oh this. Or you're the one who's always worried about hacking. Well, guess what? That's going to be the case. No matter what you do, there's goIng to. There's all sorts of problems with voting the conventional way. I mean America, we've had giant scandals and diebold voting machines that contained the third party access, the ability to manipulate the data. It's all been proven. There was a documentary called hacking democracy that showed how ludicrous it is to think that our system that's in place right now is is infallible, not, not only that, it's massively flawed. The technology that exists because of the internet, because of the ability to exchange information instantaneously with each other is unprecedented, and I think that is going to shift the idea of government that's going to shit.

Speaker 1:          02:23:23       It's going to scatter all these crazy people that are running things right now. It's not going to be viable anymore. just like kings aren't viable anymore. You can't be henry the eighth in 2015 unless you're the guy in North Korea. He's like the last one, but most. Most governments can't be run the way they were run thousands of years ago. There's too much access to information. We know you're not a god. We know you're just a person. You know, we, we, we have this ability to exchange these ideas so quickly that the word gets out too fast. You're listening to tim. Ben is lee when he talks about the worldwide web and eventually by the way it said, of course the web bits of it, and then then he talks in those terms. Actually he's quite idealistic and honestly I am a freedom of information free exchange of information and I think you're right.

Speaker 1:          02:24:13       I mean it goes right back to the beginning of the conversation, doesn't it is a good thing or a bad thing on the web. Let's say a good thing or a bad thing and you must be right in this sentence that they, as long as people you know you need to set and we're having this conversation at quite a high level. if you know we're talking about great movements and great shifts in civilization and so I suppose you need a. You need the perspective first. Don't you need the. You need your appetite stimulating for knowledge and information and to use not to use the internet or the web to get to as yourself, you need to have some instinct that I'm not going to just go find the little sliver of information that interests me and perhaps inflammation that's nonsensical and is also the, you know, how you you can go and be a conspiracy theorist and find plenty of information to support your conspiracy. He will see that tool kit so you can always talks about this in the demon haunted world. Again, by giving people a toolkit. Bullshit detectors, I think he called it, you know, the education science, the scientific method that that's a bullshit detector kit basically. So if you can get that in there, you can get that in. Maybe this is the priority really in schools to say, well, I want you to know how to think,

Speaker 2:          02:25:24       how to look information, assess where the information came from, understanding if it's likely to be tainted or biased or good or bad, or how do I assess this vast quantity information out there? How do I not get it? Whereas myself, how do I decide that I'm only going to read, I'm only going to is the external forums that say that we didn't land on the moon and there was a big conspiracy and everyone covered it up. How? How can I broaden my reach to say, is that really true? Shall I check some other stuff like the telescopes? That way you can look at the spacecraft on the moon, you know that kind of bits of evidence. So I think that's very important. Isn't it ironic that in this day and age we accumulate more data. I think there was some statistic about in every two days we accumulate more data, more like numbers and a lot of it's probably instagram pictures and twitter and shit that's useless, but that more hard data gets accumulated or processed or or or produced by humans today.

Speaker 2:          02:26:23       Then the entire time of human history up to that point, which is fucking staggering. Yeah, but it also, most of it takes place on computers. The most of it is ones and zeros. Most of it takes place in a language that you. And I can't even read if it was written on a piece of paper, no one. And it's a big subject. And how do you use data and how do we use it? There's. There's an example that the program I do in the uk called stargazing live. She'll live astronomy show on the bbc and lots of people watch it. It's kind of people like it. One of the things that we do a citizen science projects, so for example last year that we use the european space agency's database of photographs of the surface of mars. Nobody's ever looked at them, right? There's too many of them.

Speaker 2:          02:27:10       So we've got too many pitches of miles, no one know human eyes have ever looked at these pictures. So we ran a project where we wanted to answer a question about some features that we're seeing moving across the surface of mars, weather features that we thought may be seasonal. So maybe in the martian winter they moved down to the equator. Let me back up again in the summer. Didn't know. Then we proved that they were indeed seasonal by getting millions of people who watched the program to go look at the pictures for the first time so you can go online now and look at pictures of mars. Let's saY that nobody's ever seen it because it's too much data, even the of the planet, so imagine the amount of data generated on this planet that no one's ever done, that no one's ever looked at this date. They'll be data about what a increases the likelihood of certain cancers. For example, there'll be the lifestyle that does that doesn't engender that alone will be there in the data, but no one's quite got their head around now to go and mine that data and try to use it. It just. Using the data is extremely difficult and challenging, but you're right, it's there. No one ever looks at it will not only that, the idea of somehow or another preserving this, if there was some event super volcano

Speaker 3:          02:28:22       eruption, like they're constantly worried about yellowstone and there's one in Indonesia, I believe it is, that they believe is connected to a mass extinction event that killed off a giant swath of the population. Oh, they're nasty. They're the super volcanoes. Terrifying one of those to go and if one of those hits and somehow or another, the power goes out all around the world and the only people that survive are those folks that live by the volcano. Fuck man. We're starting from scratch. Like I mean relatively in terms of the universe. That's nothing. So you big baby. You got to wait another 10,000 years civilization to reemerge and someone to reinvent the internet, you know, and the ark of the covenant and still locked up in Ethiopia because they already did this and they already figured out how to make nuclear bomb or something like that.

Speaker 3:          02:29:06       When those the fuck it is. But the, the, the. For our immediate life, it's so critical to not just acquire this information, but to nurture it and to spread it. I mean, that's your whole idea, right? You're, you're just talking about expanding science and education and getting people excited and involved, but that doesn't mean jack shit. If The fucking earth spits out a giant ball of lava that engulfs half of north America and that kills 90 percent of the planet, like we're starting from scratch and there's not. None of this is going to be any good. No computers, no hard drives, no flash drives, no fucking database. It's all bullshit. The cloud go fuck your cloud. It's not really in the cloud. I've got news for you. It's down on earth and oh, it's in the cloud. No, it's not. There's no cloud. Okay. It doesn't exist. You go up and look around for your fucking data. It's not there in someone's goddamn building. Okay? It's a fucking building. Stop saying it's in the cloud because it's not a dirty, stinky, live.

Speaker 3:          02:30:03       That's reality. Unless you're launching that fucking shit up, it would have taken all the hard drives of all the world and launching it into space and you know, on a 10,000 year loop. So it comes back around and lands to, you know, you do it. 90 nine point nine percent of the speed of light. So the data you're getting back again, it comes back. Could you imagine if that's what happens like one day just they do, they pick a strategic location that they believe will be a large population of life and it really lands 10,000 years later and we go, oh fuck, look at this. Look at all the shIt they knew and it's all in dos or whatever. Some something that we could read like fairly easily. They run it through some computers and they realized like, wow, fucking people been around. Do you remember my first, my first operating system on a pc?

Speaker 3:          02:30:51       There's dust five. Remember that I was postdoc. The first computer that I ever had had windows 95 and windows 95 was the big deal. My friend chris made computers with windows three point two, three point one when she ran on dust. So. So I, yeah, I had no windows when I first got my first pc. Wow. Cool. That's crazy. And if you think about how recent you kind of guy named matt on that. Yeah, right. If someone sends you a picture, it's way bigger than that. Yeah. Every fucking pictures. 100 million. Right. And if you think that that was 1995, it was only 20 years ago and in 20 years a blink of an eye, you know, a blink of an eye. I think we should get back to dos you think? Yeah. Why? Because you want to know that it competes. It worked. You got to, you got to have these little also exec that files that designed the memory of.

Speaker 3:          02:31:50       Isn't that like more work than you need, isn't it? It's a big deal in the sentence because we, we have a problem with getting kids to write code because they'll think it's a lot of work to write code, right? Yeah. But like in the old days with the computers, you have friends that make video games and one of the most shocking things was the, the sheer amount of hours that go into coding video games. You know, the folks at id software, they let me in behind the scenes and epic games to cliff. He be our friend cliff. He was on the podcast before I would watch those guys work. They would do 16 hour days and they would just be coding and drinking fucking caffeine and just staring in front of these monitors and just running over thousands of lines of code. And you're like, oh, that's how you make a fucking video game.

Speaker 3:          02:32:39       It's kind of 100 million dollar. Things are unbelievable. They like movies. Well, they're bigger than movies. The average huge gambling, uh, grand theft auto. When those games get released, they're there. The amount of money that they generate Is rival to like avatar. Some huge spectacular hit. Like not an average movie, but it just gigantic, monumental, epic, huge successful movie that's like an average video game. Grand theft auto and madden. When those madden games come out, the fucking world changes. Like I mean people generally, there's so much income that gets poured into those video games and you realize that it's a lot of just people just coding because standing in front of computers and just pounding on a keyboard, it's madness. You know, maybe that's the way that western civilization falls. The coders stopped, people stopped fucking going to happen. They're going to stop breeding. That's just gonna happen.

Speaker 3:          02:33:34       Women. Women will stop having sex with motors and it's all going to fucking end all their accumulated knowledge that we were talking about before. Like the coders making children that are better coders. Nope. Just ends one day. Maybe you can wrIte four tran. Yeah. One day we wake up and we realized that no one's making video games anymore. So we go to these places where they made video games. So like, hello, everybody's dead cobwebs everywhere. They just died and no one fucked up the apocalypse. No. Well, imagine if computer coders ceased to exist and all of us were forced to back engineer computer code if today, like for somehow or another, I don't know how many people in this world have a deep understanding of computer operating systems or computer code, but I couldn't imagine it's more than one percent and if we lost one percent of the population just disappeared from the earth. And then the rest of us dopes. We're left to observe our cell phone crashing or fucking tri caster over here. That shit the bed on us mid broadcast. I mean if that's a critical part of our, our society of civilization itself and it totally overlooked. So you coders out there, god bless, keep breathing, keep breathing, and breathing. Breathing and breathing with the praise odin for the coders.

Speaker 3:          02:35:00       It's amazing. It's so amazing. If you really think of how much our life in our civilization revolves around electronics and around computer code, which you a monkey cage and essentially, yes, I mean it's stunning. If you really stop and think about it, every single thing that used to be mechanical and a and an analog is now computer like cars. ThIs, the main for car enthusiasts is one of the main complaints is that you don't feel what a car is doing anymore. One of the thrIlls of driving an older car like especially in old sports car, they're not as fast. They don't handle as well, but you feel everything you feel the road because it's a mechanical steering. There's no assisting. Like if you go to like a 1973 porsche nine slash 11, there's no. There's no hydraulic assist in the steering. It's all mechanical. you feel every pebble.

Speaker 3:          02:35:52       You literally feel the mechanism turning the tire. You feel the tires losing their grip. It's all transmitted through your seat and through your hands and people live for this. It's like exciting stuff, but if you drive a modern porsche, it's like there's a million operations that are going on behind the scenes and every second to avoid collisions and slow your tires down and breaking on the right side because you're turning left. I was like, all this shit that's going on that you don't even know. You don't even feel it. There's a magnetic ride control system that's adjusting. There's like there's certain cars now, like I believe mercedes benz has a camera that looks at the road in front of you and gauges whether or not the suspension should be compliant or rigid. It adjusts and you can go, I think up to like 30 miles an hour.

Speaker 3:          02:36:38       You just take your hand off the wheel and put it in cruise control and fucking turns based on the lines on the road. Do you think that said that the first sentence being is going to be a nine slash 1117? I hope it's an american car. I hope it's corvette or maybe perhaps a truck. Maybe an f150 takes out godless heathens. Just drives around, eats assholes. Um, I, I wonder, you know, I, I think for sure if we can live you and I'm 47, how old are you? 40 seven. 40 seven. So if we could live another, if we get really lucky, we live another 50 years based on modern interpretation of science and medicine. I'm actually 46 by the way, hopefully 70 march just because now got lexus open. Get at least you added the right way. You know if you like. I'm 40 ish.

Speaker 3:          02:37:29       I have a friend who won't tell me his age in edwards. He won't tell me how old he is. A motherfucker. I think he's my age, but he won't say it. I should. I should've said 47 because then we could pay the real change. Yeah, very funny. Wikipedia wikipedias long wrong about a lot of shit. I just filled it. Still thinks brian counts my brother. It's still thinks I'm five feet tall. If you. If, if you consider this idea that we. If we everything goes correct and we live to be 95 years old. Let's go. Let's go there for sure. there's going to be something. You know there's gonna be some. They've already got these little japanese talking head ones that look erie. Very strange sort of artificial faces that talk to you. There's gonna come a point in time as the exponential increase in technology, whether it's 20, 30 years where they're going to make fake fucking people. Man, let me, let me, let me pull it up.

Speaker 2:          02:38:23       Something else. Nothing to do with me. This friend of mine, alex garland, it just made a film called ex makena and which is a great science fiction film, which shouldn't be coming to the states. It's just been released in the uk x magazine.

Speaker 3:          02:38:32       Can I get it online somewhere legally? Not illegally, I suppose illegally. Can I get it? That's a problem. You fucker the second legal so I can get it.

Speaker 2:          02:38:43       You'll see the trailer, you can get the trailer on youtube, but it's been released in the states. Can't remember when, but it's, it's great. And it's about, it's about an ai, uh, a female ai and it's uh, it's about a guy kind of like one of these elan musk type guy guys. He lives out in the woods and he and he's built one of these things and he gets one of his employees to come and do a turing test on it, which is to see if he thinks that this thing has sentience, this ai. But she's beautiful and it kind of goes off from there. But alex wrote the beach and he wrote 28 days later

Speaker 3:          02:39:14       say

Speaker 2:          02:39:15       really brilliant science fiction film, but it, it is slow. Some of these issues that we've been talking about about what it is to be human, are the ais bathers, are they better than it was morally physically strange? What is it that. Why is this girl so beautiful white wine? Did he make this beautiful woman? It's just, it's a great film. So I recommend that to everyone who's listening. That sounds amazing. when is it going to be released here? It must be very soon because it's been. It's just been out in the uk. Did very well.

Speaker 3:          02:39:42       Is it going to be released in theaters or is a digital release April 10th in America. So you'd. wow, that sounds. That's a great concept. I mean, I, I've said for a long time, but I believe the first artificial intelligence be sex slaves. People are going to make artificial sucks. People. People that are going to have sex with like is it cheating to use a device? Is it cheating to masturbate? Some people say yes, I was reading a forum article was people arguing as guys arguing with his wife. She's saying if he doesn't stop masturbating, she's going to divorce him specifically to, you know,

Speaker 4:          02:40:14       augie with his hand and say he ended the insightful advice. Seven faithfulness just beat his hand up. But um, then, you know, it goes from masturbation to masturbation using technology and the internet to watch pornography to masturbation using a device. Like they have these, uh, you know, what oculus rift is, I'm sure. Right. That's good. I should go with that. The new version of it. My friend duncan called me up. I was at the improv and when, you know, when he called me, I was about to go onstage. It was like five minutes for I go on stage and he had just got back from some three d virtual reality conference and he's just screaming at my phone. It's a fucking game changer, man. This is the craziest shit. I said that it was the, the hd quaLity was stunning. I did 70. Let me have a look at the one that we, there's an oculus and something else.

Speaker 4:          02:41:05       They use them for the past four, which is not going. It's not out yet. We did it in 12 months. I think. Something like that. It's amazing that they showed me this demo and it's a real. It's like it's done. Very, very good. I think that is going to be a game changer. Well, they decided to do first person pornography with these things that supposed to just be like there was a real issue that people are going to have with being addicted to this stuff because I don't believe that our minds. I think one of the. One of the reasons why people have such a deep, like what we were talking about earlier, that people get angry, a dumb programming and people get angry at, you know, dumb songs and dump television shows. One of the reasons I think we have this instinct to get upset at it is we.

Speaker 4:          02:41:48       I think we inherently understand that we're not designed to process the media that we've created. We're designed to imitate the successful behaviors or other tribal members. We were designed to listen to people like you talk and be inspired, but you're right here. I'm looking right at you. It evolved, right? You're not, you're saying, well, I don't mean it in that sense. I mean in a sense of how we function evolved. I'm sorry, I don't mean design, but if you, if you take that into consideration, what, what? Uh, what about a screen that's 60 feet tall and brad pitt comes on and his bone structure is fucking perfect and if it's not, they manipulate it and make it perfect with three g cgi and every time he talks music's playing and every word out of his mouth is carefully considered. Although It looks spontaneous, it's not.

Speaker 4:          02:42:36       They've carefully considered this for weeks and weeks for maximum impact on your psyche and your sitting there and the music's playing and he kisses angelina jolie and oh, like we're not designed for that. So our, our very exisTence, the world that we live in, our model of it is based like ninetY percent on bullshit. Ten percent of real life experiences, 90 percent on movies. And I have a friend who got in a fight with a guy and the guy said to him while they're about to fight some drunken thing, prepare to dine in hell tonight. We dine in hell. He yelled out a fucking quote

Speaker 3:          02:43:12       from a stupid movie when they were about to fist fight. They were fist fighting, like, which could potentially leave it lead to death. I mean, when you're involved in like actively trying to hurt another human being, all fucking bets are out the window. This is chaos, right? And the guy's yelling at a movie quote tonight. We dine in the beginning of a beautiful friendship. We're just randomly sharing quotes back from the grid. We're off to see the wiz. That's crazy. You are. My brother were crazy. I don't think the, the inspiration that I get from songs, like there's songs that I'll listen to, you know, like, um, there's certain like, like weightlifting. Sorry, I swear. When you live, listen to those songs, you can lift more weights. You can work out harder. Like you're tired, you're on the elliptical. Machine. Queen comes on like dragon attack and you, your, your, your body reacts to it.

Speaker 3:          02:44:11       You have a physiological response to media is something that's been created that doesn't exist in nature with all of nature's majesty, with fucking waterfalls and flowers. It never figured out how to make sound come out of a headset. That's just incredible. It just makes your, your, your, your, your fucking goosebumps. Raise up. We've created some weird shit and in creating that weird shit, we're, we're altering our very version of the reality that we observe with our, our real senses, our eyes and our ears and our fingers and we're changing it. And this oculus rift shit, it's going to take it to a whole new place. I mean, it's gonna. It's going to be as addictive as reality tv is what? It's stupidity. It's going to be way more addictive. If you could like, look at any part of those people while they're talking, you know, I mean, you could do whatever you want. You can move around in their world while they're, while they're existing. You don't have to have a real, a real

Speaker 1:          02:45:03       life. You've seen wally. I haven't. Wally. Wally was a good. Yeah, it's great. It's a great film, but everyone just ends up every human is basically a fat useless slub that floats around. Can't even walk just on a big space line floating around in space. I'm useless. Just gone watching tv. What? That sort of sped pessimistic version of reality. What do you think? What's your version of reality? This is because we're wrapping up. We're running at three hours in when you turn into a pumpkin, so we're right about there. Like what, what is he, what do you think is going to happen with us? Are you pessimistic? Are you optimistic? Do you enjoy the way the direction we're moving ultimately? Um, the, our scientific and engineering achievement. So astonishing and going beautifully well. I think it needs, needs. I'm, I'm optimistic I think, but I think it just needs a little. I'm slightly

Speaker 2:          02:46:10       pessimistic at the moment. I think it just needs this little nudge. I think just a. We've got the weed in countries like ours, right? We've got these, these education systems and these universities that are broadly speaking, very good. They need a bit more money, but they're pretty good and we've got a culture that allows us to be open minded and we have democracies and all these things are very difficult to get. So I think we often miss the great things that we have in place in places like the us and europe. Definitely really very good. And so, so it just takes a recognition of that. I think that's what we started again, isn't it? How do you just remind people what wonderful opportunities they have and what wonderful things there are to do.

And if you can't have a gun without a yang, I mean you have a bunch of shit going on. That is, it's like a constant ebb and flow. And I always, I always ponder whether or not that is a, almost a mechanism for progress or a mechanism for advancement and that without it, you don't get that. I don't know.

Speaker 2:          02:47:38       It's possible. It is possible. So we can be optimistic at the end of the.

Speaker 4:          02:47:42       Yes. I think we wrapped it up nice. I think we brought it home in a beautiful way. I can. I say just because, because my promoters sat over there and I know he's been sitting there for three hours.
