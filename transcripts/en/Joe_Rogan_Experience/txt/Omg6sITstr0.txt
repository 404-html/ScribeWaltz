Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Doo, Doo, Doo Doo Doo

Speaker 1:          00:00:10       two. All right. Kyle Kingsbury, Hawaiian brother. I'm doing great brother. I have a present for you. This is a legit fanny pack. Look at that because your a fanny pack enthusiast. He's one of the few manly men than I can count upon to almost always be wearing a fanny pack. Wow. Look at that baby. That's a higher primate dotcom special. Oh, this is phenomenal. I wanted to get one of these back in the day. And you were out of stock. Yeah, that's right. Quite some time because that fucking sell out of these things. Believe it or not. I believe that these are made by roots and they have like a. The pocket is got a higher primate.com, like things stamped into it, but it's fucking high level baby. I found out about that one from dice clay came in, he's another fanny pack, enthusiastic. I love dies.

Speaker 1:          00:00:53       And he had sweatpants on and uh, he was wearing this beautiful leather fanny pack and I was like, where did you get that? Oh, so roots one, it's the best. And they took it off and showed it to me were like, you know, girls will like look at each other's persons. That's what we were doing. Oh yeah. You inspected the pockets. You wanted to say this is, where is my wallet? My cell phone can go. This is where my chapstick will go. So I bought one. It's legit as fuck. And then after I bought it, um, I was uh, I was so in love with and I was like, they make these for me and put my stamp on it. And they said yes. So the zipper pocket, if you look at it, it has the higher primates stamp with the champ of the light bulb above his head.

Speaker 1:          00:01:30       Pretty Sweet, Huh? Yeah. This is amazing. Look with the one you're wearing, bro, is like, it screams, hiker. Screams hitchhiker. It is. I got this pack safe. I got this before. Go into central and South America because you can lock the zippers so people can't get into it. Can't pick pocket. Yeah. Cables on the, uh, on the band. They're like steel cables so they can't cut them. Rarely do like a lot of slash and grab stuff over there. I guess. Jesus Christ. Let me see this thing. You've got my ma. I need to change brands. Survival pack. It's back. This might travel. Wait, so you could do curls with the travel. Wait, and this has a chords in it when you feel to have them little cords, you can't cut it. Heavy duty ratable. Oh my goodness. And when you, when you click that in there, there's a three buttons to open it up.

Speaker 1:          00:02:17       Not your normal two button action. Oh yeah. One, two and three. This is legit. They got the RF R I r I f, D Rfd, Card radio frequency. So if you're passing by and some little hackers on his laptop, he can't steal all your apple pay information from your iphone and shit like that. Someone can do that. Fuck yeah. Just walking by you. Haven't you seen rogue nation? Try not to. I tried to try to stay as far out of the loop with all these fucking hacker wipper. Stanford. What does this bad boy is? So that's where you click all those three together. You put a lock on it. I see. Dude, this is impressive stuff. They made it out of Calvin bar. It'd be even better. Cover your Dick. You know, they make clothes now out of Kevlar that they look like regular clothes, but you can take a bullet with him,

Speaker 1:          00:03:09       like how it's going to fall. It would penetrate you slightly and then come out and feel awesome. Yeah. But it's going to keep the from going through into your body. It'll hurt. What do you think that would feel like? It depends on the round, but uh, it wouldn't feel good. It's, I've, I've talked to people that have been shot with bulletproof vests that say say it's like getting punched. But. So are these plates like in pants and shit like that? Or is this like some type of material that's moveable? It's both. They have some of them, they even have some that prevent you from knife attacks. They have like a, a thick Mesh Kevlar that seems more real. Kind of like a chain mail. The bad guy wears in commando. Yeah. There's a, uh, there was a vice documentary or vice piece on this guy who is known for making bulletproof close. He's a tailor, I want to say Columbia, I think he's in Bogota, but he's, um, he's known for making like really nice clothes that just happened to be bulletproof. Like the whole deal underwear, everything. That's pretty bad ass. That's pretty bad. That's like the kingsmen guy as I said. Yeah. Here you go. Israeli reporter testing and knife proof vest ends up getting stabbed. Well, well that's not good. Well, he actually got stabbed all the way through or just a little bit. Oh Jesus Christ.

Speaker 1:          00:04:28       This is a commando knife and he's just gonna fucking stab him with this thing. Is this guy doing sign language in the lower left? Oh, that's hilarious. You wouldn't pick up the stab here. Penetrating through.

Speaker 2:          00:04:43       We,

Speaker 1:          00:04:48       I missed. He said, yeah, fucking dudes going to be bleeding.

Speaker 1:          00:04:53       That dude downplayed it pretty well for getting stabbed. Yeah. He, uh, took it. He took it quite easily. Jesus Christ. I guess it works I guess a little bit. Yeah, I mean it's definitely better than not having that on. He would be dead works sometimes. It works a little bit. It was like step me like this. That'll live in color. Your stay here to be like this. Well, you've seen those martial arts demonstrations with those guys. Do that. Like come at you with a knife. The other guy, the stabbing technique. Always. Yeah. They say that the best way to knife fight is actually to put your arm forward. You wrap your clothes or on your arm and put a knife in your back hand. Meanwhile, why the fuck do I know what the best way to knife fight is? What are the odds you're ever going to get in a knife fight like you and another guy on the beach like circling each other with a knife and your jacket wrapped around your forearm and b, it starts playing to town. Oh No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Yeah, that's right. They were switchblades right? They had a little knife fight. They were tied together. People just do knife fights in the movies. Remember those. That was a big thing in movies and been back in the

Speaker 3:          00:05:58       old musicals. What was that? A West side story there. They did Saturday night fever. Have a knife fight. It did, right. They had a knife fight too. What the fuck is wrong with people back then? All the cocaine. Is that what it was? I don't know. What did the cocaine kick can? It was in the eighties, right? I think it was around in the seventies and it just got giant in the eighties. Have you watched narcos? No, but I hear it's awesome to actually. Eddie Bravo to always talks about how it's just. Yeah, he's hooked. He got me. He got me hooked and now I'm hooked. I'm trying to spread the world, spread it to the world. We're looking for new shows. It's a fucking awesome show, man. It's incredible. It's really, really nuts. So it was a documentary style or. No, it's um, there's some real footage of uh, the actual med, a in cartel and you know, there's some real footage of like the different busts and some murder footage.

Speaker 3:          00:06:49       Some bodies that they really real, real, um, like some of the horrible atrocities they committed. They, they show you real footage of that. But for the most part it just is the story of Pablo Escobar and his rise to power. That's right. It is fucking bad ass dude. It's so dope. They just did such a good job. Netflix just as Netflix. Yeah. Okay. They have so much fucking money, man. They can, they can put together these things and make them like, like 10 movies, you know, it's like ten one hour movies. That's the best. I can't really. We have trouble watching regular tv now. Like hbo kind of spoiled us. You watch a show. I mean even though the beauty of Netflix is that you get it all at once, so the whole season, but even still like we're watching dexter back in the day or. And there was really only a few good seasons there, but you know, whatever show that's on that, that you can watch straight through with no commercials and no fast forwarding.

Speaker 3:          00:07:40       Yeah. Night and day better than having to use the dvr and sit through the commercials. This just, that's caveman shit's. It's terrible. It's old days. It's terrible. Those are the old days were done with the commercial. They need to come up with a new way to sell you shit, you know, like interrupting TV shows. It just makes me not want to buy their stuff. There was some new comedy on tbs. I don't know why we were watching it, but they kept showing Ford ads during the show and they were trying. They would make like a little chime, like pong and then they would have this giant Ford.com on the bottom. Like they were trying to do it so blatant that it was humorous, but at the same time it was like fucking irking me. Like what was this ridiculous? It was some new comedy on tbs, some cheese Dick, a cop show.

Speaker 3:          00:08:24       So while the show is on the, the commercials playing over the dialogue and all that stuff would just go home and then you'd see this thing like superimposed over the bottom of the screen for Daca and was repeated though. Like, I mean, after the commercials you see this just pop up and they're like, this is the future of TV. Then we're like that. That's what they're doing to try to counter dvrs. Just stick it even more in your face. It's fucking gross, man. Just over the top with it. So stupid. It's such a dumb way to advertise. They just have to figure out a better way to let people know about their shit, you know? Just some, some cool way. That's not the way to do it, but that's neither here nor there. No, I love saying that. I never get to know their heritage.

Speaker 3:          00:09:11       So Dude, I'm on that diet. I'm on the ketogenic diet now or trying to get into it and you know, you talking about it with me sort of inspired me a little bit because one of the big things a lot of people are saying you can't be. You can't do explosive activities. Bullshit. Kyle Kingsbury's punk and you fucking nerds. Oh, you nutrition nerds. I'll tell you what, man, if you get into any sort of a diet online or tell people you're gonna, try something. The fucking experts come so many people. Even when that's why I deleted my facebook account, I just couldn't stand over the years in the UFC. I just would say, oh sure, yeah, I allow you to be friends with. I need to be friends. That kind of thing. And then over time you've got 5,000 people that think through your pals, like at least on twitter, I follow who I want to follow.

Speaker 3:          00:09:54       That's that. I'm not subscribed to any of their shit. You know, one point 7 million people following you online on twitter alone, you know, you post, you're going to do this and people come out the woodwork about it. I would write about like, oh, I just read this book. It's phenomenal. Check it out. You know? And then everybody's got to come up with this. So here's a article I found online. I will send you the link and this guy's a total wack job. He's an idiot. This like this. Like this one paragraph somebody wrote, it's going to totally dispel and throw out the window what this guy spent years researching and putting together in his book. Yeah. It's always like Vegan news.com. You're like, oh, Jesus sits on a real source of dare you. But um, this, uh, this diet, I, so I've been on it now only for four days.

Speaker 3:          00:10:36       This is today I think is the fourth, third or fourth day, let's call it the third day, third day, 100 percent. And uh, I had headaches unlike the, somewhere around the second day I started getting a little bit ahead of. I read that on your instagram, but it's got a fix for it. What's the fix? So a lot of people, when they transition low carb, they have, there's a window before you start producing ketones on your own, right? You can jumpstart that window with fasting, which is a total pain in the ass, especially if you're carbohydrate dependent or you can cheat it by using mct oil. So if you up your MCTs, the first three days kind of borderline where you might shoot yourself, then you have, you totally negate any of that really feeling like groggy. Like I don't have the energy or fuck man, I can't move like you, you can eliminate that completely with MCTs.

Speaker 3:          00:11:23       Why does mct oil make you shit yourself? Because it does. It does. And I'm not going to lie. Uh, I've shipped myself at least five times in the past two years as an adult. Some drunk milk I don't drink anymore, but yeah. What was it? The mcts. I got a little cocky, you know, like I know I measure everything out religiously now. I mean, but in this, everything's fine tuning. It's all personal process. I had to start with a teaspoon. Now I'm up to four tablespoons per pot of coffee. I make a whole pot blended up with a two to one ratio of kerrygold butter to the MCT oil. Then I have my little Stevia drops, that kind of thing. If I'm on the road, I got other stuff, but I don't. I used to, if I was on the road and I'm having coffee, I would just take a gulp of mct Nixon.

Speaker 3:          00:12:12       You bring your own whipping cream here. What is that heavy cream? Yeah, you got to get on it bro. Unless you don't have a. If you don't have a lot of heavy cream. Got to get on it, bro. You got to Stevia drops here. Just like Jim Carrey does. What's the, just like Jim Carrey, Jim Carrey has stevia drops a everyone go check out the. The coffee. What does the coffee in cars with comedians. Oh, he brings Stevia drops or the. He does it when he's out with Seinfeld. It's awesome. So. So tell me why do you have heavy whipping cream? Well, no, this is, first of all is mark sisson detail earlier. This is grass fed free range. All good stuff. I don't have a lactose intolerant or a dairy intolerance. So that's, let's iron that out right now. I don't recommend this to anybody who does.

Speaker 3:          00:12:59       Um, but this is a way to get more fat. And that's really what you're trying to do. We'd as natural people from a primal standpoint when in periods of Ketosis, no matter where we were on planet earth, so I know you were talking about the other day, like what is this ancestral diet stuff, that kind of stuff that's based on where you live. So if you had ancestors from the Poles, then you likely had big game and fruits and vegetables and things that grew in colder climates, you know, like Kale and shit like that. If you were by the equator, smaller stuff, smaller live animals like chicken, fish, those kinds of things and then much more carbohydrates, but both, no matter where you were from, you had periods where you didn't eat. So that's someone you'd produce your own ketones to remain in a ketogenic state.

Speaker 3:          00:13:45       He really do have to have a much higher level of fat and people think like way more to where you. It's counterintuitive, especially with cholesterol and things like that. But the research is out. I mean these guys are putting together things. Uh, Dr David Perlmutter wrote Grain Brain in 2013. He had researched from 2013 and 2012 and 2011 all in the book in Twenty 15. He followed up with brain maker. Brand new studies are being put in that book. So this is like the very latest and what they're showing across the board is for all the mental disorders like Alzheimer's, dementia, Parkinson's, they all have to do with a really high blood sugar levels over time. So one person might manifest as type two diabetes and other person might get Alzheimer's. It's just your genetic coding. That's the genetic difference. Eating like Shit's going to get you to have that disease, you know, manifest itself.

Speaker 3:          00:14:35       It's just sugar itself seems to be just really, really bad. It's a bad deal. Yeah. So. But as you'll find it's really easy to eat too much protein on the Diet and that can knock you out of ketosis. So really getting too much protein knocks you out of Ketosis. There's a, there's a process the body does called gluconeogenesis and this is kind of where Atkins failed a lot of people. Even my dad was, oh, dot koons. I lost weight and what I felt like, Shit, you know, I have this pain across my chest and they call it like Atkins fever. Feel like flu symptoms, right? Right. That comes from what's your, what's your energy source? So if people do a low carb diet and they think, well, I don't want to have too much fat because that's not healthy and they don't understand good fats and bad fats.

Speaker 3:          00:15:15       So they say, okay, well I'll just stop my protein to fill up and I'll have a little bit of fat and low carb. Well now your body has to take protein and turn it back into glucose and that's what gluconeogenesis does and it's a very you, your body will do it, but it's not an easy thing to do. Fat and carbohydrates are much, much easier as energy sources. So if you can keep protein moderate, that's why now modified Atkins or ketogenic diets, they'll tell you it's high fat, moderate protein, low carb. So when you say like moderate, like how many grams, grams of protein do you get in a day? That's all individual for anybody. You know, if you're working out how you work out you about to 20, something like that. I went to 25 right now. I probably have, I don't know, definitely under 140 grams of protein.

Speaker 3:          00:16:02       Really? That's interesting because I'm. The bodybuilder method was one gram per pound at least, and they were doing six, seven meals a day. Look the. So if you're were putting on size, I'm not going to tilt. Dorian Yates how to put on size. Like he, they, they eat that way specifically for gains and that is scientifically proven to help with gains. You're eating like a child basically. You have a newborn. They eat every two hours. They're, they're eating everything. Carbohydrates, protein and fat. Right? So when you want to gain size, that's the way to do it. But for this you don't necessarily need that. And you can employ different methods like intermittent fasting where they talk about skip breakfast and just eat between 12 and seven. You're not that protein window of Oh my, my nitrogen balance is lowering. I'm going to lose muscle mass. It's total crap.

Speaker 3:          00:16:50       They will tell you, oh, you skip a meal, you're gonna, you're gonna. Get weak, bro. Total crap. All the hormones that give us, um, recovery, anything like that, igf one and growth hormone, they all go through the roof when we donate. So the longer we fast the hierarchy, ketone production is the hierarchy. Anti catabolic hormones are so their muscle preserving. Now you could do a fast incorrectly and you know, you go run a wrong long race or, or if you did high intensity stuff fasted then yeah, you'd be running into problems there with that because that's autolysis right? Your body starts to break down muscle tissue. Is that what it's called? Autolysis because you're working. Glycolytic. This is all right in there in the primal endurance book. But Marxist, I got the pick that up right after it was on the show. Yeah, I didn't.

Speaker 3:          00:17:33       Neil Kendall, I really enjoyed talking to that guy. That was. Yeah, that was a really cool conversation and a very eyeopening. You know, one, one thing that really opened my eyes are really had me thinking was they've shown on studies recently on children that have epilepsy, that putting them in a ketogenic state seems to stop epileptic seizures or significantly reduce them. That's how the Diet was developed in the 19 twenties that I think it was John Hopkins University or hospital, not university, Johns Hopkins, whatever put together. They had a team of guys there that figured it out. And um, there's actually a guy who was on the Tim Ferriss podcast. Dr Dominic D'agostino, who is awesome. Yeah, check him out. He's out. I heard that one. South Florida. He's fasted for seven days and then left the house for 15 reps, did five 85 or single, then gave a lecture to 300 plus people on fasting and ketogenic diets.

Speaker 3:          00:18:31       That guy's a trip. He's, he's really fascinating. Super fucking intelligent now, like you're listening to them talk about it and how he travels with his own exogenous ketones that he throws into his food. Have you tried those yet? Know how nasty the rocket fuel stuff that when they first came out with a liquid. It is, it is jet fuel. I mean, it'll, it'll make you a quiver. I mean, I think that stuff tastes worse than, than Iowasca. But uh, the now the new stuff, they make it with Stevia. It's all natural flavors like orange, Quito, candidates. It's awesome stuff. You. What's the, what's the thought process between behind eating exoticness ketones? How does that work? Well, here's what I've noticed. I'm, if I'm in a ketogenic state and Keto adapted and I'm producing my own ketones, I feel a huge bump from a product like, like that sergeant in addition, right?

Speaker 3:          00:19:23       Uh, if I'm in a carbohydrate necessary, you know, energy system and I haven't been in Ketosis for awhile and then I have like, oh, okay, well I'm going to get low sleep tonight, so I want ketones. I might feel like a slight difference, but it's not going to be nearly as dramatic as if I'm already in Ketosis. Really? Yeah. Which is odd to me. I don't know the mechanism of how it works or if my body just more in tuned to use them when there's no carbohydrates there, but it's night and day. I think the product is expensive, like 75, 85 bucks for 15 servings probably we're going so I wouldn't use it every day, but I'd use it for like a big race. A Tasha and I are doing a 50 K in Zion coming up in April. I'll be using them for that for sure. You would do it the morning of the race during the race, during the race, like 15 minutes beforehand and then every couple hours in for sure. And now. How long have you been doing a Ketogenic Diet? A man, at least a year and a half. I've been in and out. Obviously I'm not going to. There is no point where I'll never eat carbs again. Yeah, they're phenomenal.

Speaker 3:          00:20:31       There's periods of times where I'll do like a 12 week block, strict Kurtosis or 16 weeks in a row. Straight district toast. What do you find when you do that? Like what's the difference? The biggest thing that I feel is a cognitive boost, it's night and day. The sharpness I have mentally is a. I mean, that's, that's, that's really what keeps me coming back to it is the mental clarity and focus. Um, and then that's really interesting to lose a little bit of water weight because glycogen holds water in the muscles so you don't lose any strength, but you'll lose some of that water weight. And uh, I just feel more flexible. So when I do yoga and things like that, like I can get into postures I could never get into when a carbs. Like I can't get into Lotus when I'm, when I'm eating carbs, even if it's only five pounds difference in my overall body weight, I can get into ketosis.

Speaker 3:          00:21:19       Oh yeah. What the fuck. So what, where is it binding in your knees and your hips? Like what's, what's holding you back while you're holding water in for every gram of glycogen, you hold four grams of water in the muscle. So. So it makes sense if you are loading on carbohydrates and things, even if you're not carb loading, but if your carb dependent, your muscles are going to hold more water than if they weren't. Is there any benefit to that as far as utilization of energy or ketones? I mean this is all coming out of Steve Finney and Jeff Volek, they wrote the art and science of low carbohydrate living in the art and science of low carbohydrate performance and mark sisson of references them. They really broke down studies on athletes in a ketogenic diet and things like that and saw exactly what, what kind of enhancements that are being done.

Speaker 3:          00:22:05       And they kind of broke the mold of what was done before when they ran tests, you know, gatorade was running tests and it was coming up like, hey, if you do this, you simply aren't going to be able to outperform somebody who has carbohydrates. They weren't looking at somebody that was keto adapted. So it does take six to eight weeks to make your body prefer fat. Okay. So what they were doing was just trying it on people. They put them in a state of Ketosis for like a couple of weeks and then two weeks exactly two weeks or six to eight weeks, six to eight weeks. And other people will tell you the longer the better. So if you were like, these guys that are winning the western states, 100 is 100 mile race, um, they're, they're in it for years. You know, you do pretty strict for a year and a half and then you see some, some significant jumps in fat oxidation rates.

Speaker 3:          00:22:50       So how many, how much can I break down in an hour while I'm under stress? That changes dramatically. The longer you stay in it. Now when you do that, is it beneficial to put on some body fat for a long race like that? Because if you're in a ketogenic state, your body can burn off that fat. You would have. They they've cry can't, I can't read off numbers off the top of my head, but I mean when they talk about how many, how much calories you can hold from glycogen stored in the liver and all the carb loading you can do versus how much fat you have on your body. You could run for days. That's why we confessed. It's literally why. That's another thing like to dispel a bodybuilder myth on muscle. If we lost muscle dramatically from fasting, then how do we chase down the heard three, four or five days into not having food like, right.

Speaker 3:          00:23:39       We for sure evolve to be able to do this so we could go long periods of time and have our explosiveness when we needed it, you know, and they weren't jumping on treadmills and doing stupid shit like we have to do now, but at the same time, like it was important for human beings to be able to have energy still in a fasted state for that long. And what you're talking about for people who are unaware, it's called persistence hunting and it's one of the first methods of hunting that ancient people used to do and still do in parts of Africa where they'll run and chase down. Like if an animal like an antelope, they run very fast for short periods of time, but they overheat, they get, they get hot and they get tired and they can't run like we can. We can run at a slower pace for way longer.

Speaker 3:          00:24:20       We could run all day because we sweat, they don't sweat. So they overheat. And so what ancient hunters would do is just chase them literally until they dropped and they would stab them. There's some pretty fucking trippy videos of guys doing that today in Africa. That sounds bad ass. It's pretty crazy. They just chase these animals down until eventually they just give up and then they stab them. I can't imagine the runner's high have chasing prey that long. And, and like your, that's your food. It's not like, Oh hey, let's spend five grand and go into safari. Like that's your food. You know, like that must give you the thrill alive. Yeah. Yeah. I'm gonna bring us back for my family. This is not something you did while you were fighting? No. Um, you know, in fighting at the way I like to word this is a, I used to play video games and love to do shit and I'm not knocking video games.

Speaker 3:          00:25:07       I'm in a video game coming up here. It's going to be awesome. What does the Mafia three by two k games. Awesome. The guy who played like a hitman or some shit. I'm the dude. The dude, the dude. It's a one player game that's like a grand theft auto. Oh, but you don't beat up hookers after banging them. You do like more a revenge game trying to come after these guys for killing my family. Oh. And I get to do. I mean the whole thing is motion capture. So if you guy farts, it's me and a suit doing it real. Anything he does, it's me doing it. Wow. So, um, how long did you have to do that for? We're still working on it. It's coming out this summer. It's been, I've been doing that for since I retired last year and a half. It's crazy how intensive video games are about people working behind it now. Uh, grand theft auto, five grand theft auto five had. This is, this is the trailer mafia three. Let's see here. Don't tell, don't, don't graphics

Speaker 2:          00:27:06       videos. How long has it.

Speaker 3:          00:27:12       So is this you here with the backpack dismay the whole way. I had to do all that shit at the end here. I kicked this guy into the creek. Uh, the face is different. It's an actor named Alex from New York. He's awesome. So the facial scan and the voice just fucking video. The video is incredible. Whoa.

Speaker 3:          00:27:52       Does it feel bizarre having some dude's face on your body now? Because I've met him and he's awesome. If he was a Douche then I would look at it totally different. But I love the guy. He's awesome. That would suck. The fucking video. Graphics are insane. This is really downplayed too, just because it's the youtube, like when you, when I go in the studio and see what they've done with it and you get to play the game, the end game is just, it's, it's, they have whole teams that do the environment, whole teams that do buildings, everything you can go into. There's not a door in the game that you can't walk into and have some type of environment to play with. Just like the hair and the, the grass when they were in nom, they're flying with the helicopters, so they look at the fucking grass, the shadows, and this is incredible. The facial recognition is the same stuff that Robert Zemeckis was using in his movies when they walk in. We flew to La to do it. It's pretty.

Speaker 2:          00:28:47       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:28:50       Soundtrack. Yeah. Well it's late sixties, early seventies officers. Some good music to choose from. This is awesome, man. Wow. Well we get fucking some nights gory kills for people that are into that sort of thing.

Speaker 2:          00:29:09       Wow.

Speaker 3:          00:29:11       Yeah. It's amazing how like if you want to talk about people that work hard, nobody works like why don't say nobody, but they work some insane fucking long hours, man. Putting together a video game with some really time intensive stuff. It's. Yeah, and it's around the clock. Yeah. You see these guys when I go, when I go to the MOCAP studio, it's real laid back the same place. They do like the web game and the basketball game, that kind of thing. But when you go in and you see the guys that write the code and actually make the game, the, these, you can tell like they're, if they're on a deadline, get you're having to fix bugs and do all kinds of things and there's just a grind. Like they're definitely putting in extreme hours. Yeah, it's horrific. But what I was getting to before I jumped off on the side there was in, in fighting, I always had.

Speaker 3:          00:29:58       I had, uh, an idea of what I could do with my time and if I had a fight coming up and I'm playing video games, there's nothing like a deadline of this guy's gonna try to knock me out in six weeks, five weeks, four weeks, three weeks, every day you start to look at that day, at the end of the day and say, what did I do today to make myself better? How did I spend my time? And if my pie chart had three hours of entertaining myself, when it could have been learning about something else to help me, like nutrition or different training modalities, that kind of thing. I mean, the choice was made. I'll just overnight it was like, okay, I'm done playing video games. I have a playstation three just collecting dust. I don't have a new jet. Next generation I'll probably get one just to play this game.

Speaker 3:          00:30:42       But um, yeah, that really instilled in me a love and a thirst for knowledge. And that's when I started reading about. I've read more books in my fight career than I ever did in college. That's interesting ever. I mean, I have these camps where that's really how I'd spend my time is just trying to figure out how to better myself for the flight. When you were in a strange position too, because you were a guy who came to martial arts sort of late in life, so you came into it late in life as a great athlete who's learning all the different aspects of mma, all the different martial arts techniques and then competing in the highest level of the sport, like pretty much right away. Yeah, that was pretty dumb.

Speaker 3:          00:31:25       It could have gotten a lot smarter, but yeah, it could have gotten a lot, lot more intelligently planning a career and things like that, but really it just all happened by storm. You know? I agree that that's not the way to do it, but some people can. John Jones, you know, there's a few guys that. Can. I look at, talk about Jon Jones or a guy like Daniel cormier. You look at the wrestling background. It's not like they were doing something totally different in martial arts the whole time, whether you want to call it that or not. They're in martial arts their whole lives and then now they can focus on, I mean look at corn maze has striking because he didn't have to focus on. He didn't have to spend time dividing up that pie chart into wrestling practice and other things. Right. You know, just a little bit.

Speaker 3:          00:32:09       We'll keep them sharp there, but I can really learn these other things and dive into them. What's also, when you are a master at one of those things like sort of how Damien Maia is, would you Jitsu such a master at it that all those other things, you know, he, he just has to be proficient enough so he can get you in a position where he could use his mastery. Even look at Verdugo is striking is really improved over the years because he always had jujitsu moves back. Exactly, exactly. And had it on such a high level than anybody he gets to the ground with is pretty fucked. You're in a real bad spot,

Speaker 1:          00:32:40       but your, your path was the path of the ultimate fighter. You know, that TV show and like in not even eating, not just people that are on the TV show, but people that do well in the smaller circuit, you know, smaller shows and then, you know, they get a couple of fights under their belt and they start looking good and then they get the call, you know, hey, we need a fight. Someone needs to um, fight this guy on, you know, three weeks notice you willing to do this. That's how a lot of guys getting into the UFC fall outs. You know, someone from another organization looks attractive. They've got something going on, like, this guy's got potential. But to, to engineer a career correctly, you would do it the swim, the sort of the same way they did with floyd mayweather in boxing or someone along those lines.

Speaker 1:          00:33:24       You would take them slowly through the amateur ranks, develop their skills and then test them a little bit more, every fight a little bit more. Give them some fights where they can work on some things. Give him a guy who was a brawler. Give them a guy who's a box. Everybody's feather fisted. Give them a guy who you know, who's he hits really hard, but he fades after two or three rounds and there's all these different sorts of tests that you can give a boxer and know when they're ready for those tests were the whole time they're getting their cages to or reading time in, getting all that butterflies out. They're spending more time in the pocket and inside the old telephone poll booth up with you. They just fucking put your ass in a catapult. Launched you into the deepest part of the ocean.

Speaker 3:          00:34:09       It was quick. Yeah. Was doubt. That was never a plan though, right? It was like something that's Sorta came along. Well, football ended at Asu and I was pretty depressed. I didn't know what I wanted to do. I knew I didn't want to have it fucking desk job. And uh, athletics were really my outlet in life, you know, I hadn't discovered psychedelics or meditation or any of that stuff. Sorry. So inappropriate. No worries. I had turned it up just so I could hear you. So, um, but what led you to, um, I started training in mixed martial arts just because I was tired of being a rat on the wheel, you know, treadmills and lifting weights wasn't doing it for me and 26. Wow. No martial arts at all before that. Uh, I mean I wrestled in high school, so high school wrestling background ball for years, uh, three years in, two years in junior high.

Speaker 3:          00:35:00       I was decent, not great but um, but yeah, so we got into it and then uh, as I was learning, there was a local guy down in Arizona and he ran it like a little sleazy organization down there and he was like, Hey, you know, you're big. And he looked good and I know you played football at Asu. Why don't you get in there and fight for me? And I was like, I don't know man. I fought a lot growing up. But it's different. It's different when you are in the moment and you want to destroy someone versus some guy who was trained for you, you've never met before. It's like, do it, get your feet wet. If you like it, do it again. If you don't like it, never do it again, but at least try one time. Right. It's like, okay. So my first fight, it was a 29 second victory.

Speaker 3:          00:35:41       Second fight was the 19 second victory, both knees to the stomach off of like three months in Muay Thai training. And then from there I was, looked like you knock a guy out, you know, that is fucking, there's no drug like that. I mean, you're just like, just lit up on fire. And then I started training and really trying to get more serious about it, but I fought a lot of fights quickly. So there was no development in between. I got to five. No, inside five months. I'm six zero a sign with the king of the cage after that. And then, uh, yeah, I was getting $100 a fight. My first fight fights. Wow. And then, uh, I got a thousand dollars a fight and king of the cage. And, uh, after I took my first loss I was still training out, kind of doing my own thing in Arizona, so before Bader and those guys had their own gym and so cain was at ak and I'm from the bay area.

Speaker 3:          00:36:32       I was born and raised there, so it just made sense. Like I knew came from college, but I didn't, we weren't pals or anything, I just knew him when I was playing football and he was wrestling. I was like, oh, it has to. Heavyweight wrestler I hear is bad dude. And then when I heard he was at k already and you already had cost check Swick Fitch Thompson Aka was already Aka, you know, and, and, uh, frank shamrock had already been there. Bob Cook had an in with the UFC, that kind of thing. So it just made sense to move home and start training their full time. And that's what I did. And within I think six months they got me on the ultimate fighter season eight and the rest is history. Wow. Do you ever think of it like, man, if I had to do it all again differently, how I would do it slower, I would, would take my, there's a million changes I could have made to it, but in the end I'm, I'm really happy with what fighting gave me.

Speaker 3:          00:37:24       Fighting brought me. It just, I mean I can't say like, oh, I give this all, all the credit here, but that doorway opened up other doorways and those doorways open up other doorways to me and that really was a catalyst for me having just deep peace inside, you know, and all these things came from that one little bead in fighting, you know, like wanting to do better for myself because the guy was going to punch me meant learning about meditation, learning about breathwork, learning about just getting more to life, you know? And then, oh okay, hey, the psychedelics can be a teacher as well, you know, those kinds of things all kind of came to me in, in that same timeline. So it was sort of like the, not necessarily anxiety, but the urgency of knowing that you had to prepare for combat, that you're constantly trying to better yourself because the consequences of not doing that are so grave that it sort of like ignited this fuel for improvement in you.

Speaker 3:          00:38:21       Yeah. I was like, what the fuck did I do today? You know, like you look back at the end of the day, like, what did I do today? Did I do anything to make me better than I, you know, like it's one thing to be a lot of guys are like, hey, it only went to the gym twice a train hard. I got a massage. That was my recovery. I'm good, I'm good with watching TV and just vegging out and doing whatever. And that's fine if you're. I mean when you're beat sometimes you just need to entertain yourself and relax and that's fine too. But you know that that just fueled reading. I'm really became like where I'm going to read and in meditation, but meditation, I was like a lot of people. I didn't get it for a very long time. I just kind of forced myself to do it and over time we've got a little easier, but it wasn't until Iowaska that I really understood meditation and now with Wim Hoff, I mean he's just added a whole nother layer to meditation for me that I didn't have before.

Speaker 3:          00:39:10       Same thing with my wife. I mean the Wim Hof breathing techniques are just. They're phenomenal. Yeah. He's incredible. I can't say enough good stuff about that guy. He's a fascinating character to. You know, what he's been able to do. It was like the swimming underwater on the blocks of ice, the in the frozen ocean. One hundred yards. We're supposed to swim 50 and he missed the whole and he doubled his distance and then frozen retinas fucking g couldn't see because eyeballs froze like what? God dammit. He's incredible. He's a very unusual human, but a lot of people use that method. Now, that method of breathing, I use it before go on stage. I take these big crazy wim hoff breaths before I go onstage. There's something to in letting go. Yeah. The way in let her go. Yeah. He's. He's quite a character. Matt and he's quite a quite an inspirational guy too.

Speaker 3:          00:40:00       There's a lot of people that have really gravitated towards him. His story was amazing and I've heard him on Ferris. I heard them on up in greenfields podcast when you've had them on and you correct beers. He opened up, you know what I'm saying? Like you could tell he got comfortable. You could get more from him than the vice docket and I love vice, but I thought the vice documentary, it was shit 40 minutes. This guy is fixing his fucking hair and I can't tell if people are following because he's so charismatic or not like no dude. That face, that feeling is believing, right? The second you feel that charge and your hands three, four or five rounds deep, you know, like he's not full of shit. Like you're feeling cheat, you're feeling energy, you're feeling what you can label it whatever you want, but I mean you do.

Speaker 3:          00:40:42       You feel good inside. That's undeniable. Well, inspiration is, is a type of fuel, right? I mean when you get inspired, you fire up. You literally can feel yourself getting, getting pumped. Right? Well, what is that? If you hear a great song, were you working out and you're like, and you just get fucking pumped. That's a real thing. Whatever that is, like whatever that is, whatever the feeling that you get that comes along with inspiration, like whether it's a great movie or a great song or something that just really gets you. That energy is real. You know Israel, where the person's coming from. Well that's thousands of years. People have discussed it and know some people, oh, that's woo shit, or what are you going to tell me what my fucking aura looks like? I can't see your fucking whore of, but I do believe we had this energy field and fact there's, there's books and there's science that backness.

Speaker 1:          00:41:34       Now I'm Valerie Hunt wrote a infinite mind. She was a professor at Ucla and they actually have a place in Ucla where they can conduct studies on the human energy field and they've mapped this out by changing things. The electromagnetism they can make people have emotional breakdowns, lose complete loss of motor control like they have just all of a sudden they have to sit. That can't even stand the kid keep themselves up, but how are they doing it? Like with like they're manipulating through ion? No, no, no. That's like a metal to get a giant metal room, some type of special room that they have them go in and uh, they just change this thing on a dial and the field influences your human energy field. Whoa. And it's fucking verified that did this a while ago too. That's as crazy as it's like they've known about this seventies, eighties for sure.

Speaker 1:          00:42:24       This is an incredible radiolab podcast where, um, uh, they, they put electrodes on this woman, they center through this sniper training video game thing that they do where you have like a rifle and a, there's a video game in front of you and presented with all these different scenarios, like a hostage takeover. This terrorist show up. They start shooting at you and you tried to shoot the terrorist under duress, you know, you're stressed out. And so they take her through this thing. She does terrible. Just her. Everything's off, just panicky everything. And then they do it when they attach these electrodes tour and stimulate with electricity. Parts of her head just on the outside, like transdermally. I think it's where they doing electrical stimulation. Certain frequencies when they're trying to manipulate frequency or it was just trying to work like on frontal lobe or things like that.

Speaker 1:          00:43:13       I don't know. I don't know the exact science behind it, but she then did it and went like 10 for 10, like killed everybody. Like it was insane. Like her accuracy went through the roof. Now the kids doing this shit where they try to make their own at a battery packs. Like, Hey, this is all new science and has been doing this for decades. We don't know what the ramifications are. That was the Radiolab podcast sort of focused on some of those people. Like, oh well I went deaf for a couple of days. Like fuck you do in your head man, because they're just taking like nine volt batteries and like taping wires to their skull and juicing themselves. No fucking clue what they're doing. If there's something going on and they, the researchers that are working on it, I think that they can accentuate learning.

Speaker 1:          00:43:56       They can accentuate flow states where you get into some sort of a zen moment guaranteed if you're familiar with binaural beats, right? Yes. So a binder that's something that for in the 19 fifties, they wanted to see what a sound sound wave therapy could do and things like that. And basically, um, so you would wear headphones or earbuds and the basic concept, the premise would be I can play something at eight Hertz through your left and 12 hertz through your right. And your brain will match them in the middle at 10 hertz. 10 Hertz is the

Speaker 3:          00:44:32       frequency of Alpha waves. So our brain produces a wide variety of different waves from zero point five delta when you're in deep sleep all the way up to Beta state, which we're in right now, drinking coffee and thinking. In between that you have an Alpha state which is closer to the earth's residents, the earth's magnetic field where that's like a meditative state. So you could have a flow state there. And Rob Marcus has spoken about this, um, that is the flow state range between like seven point eight to 11, somewhere in there. Then below that deep meditation, state of state, pre sleep, and then delta and, and there's other other things in there, but basically through a binaural beats you put on these headphones, you can listen to whatever, uh, the ocean or rain or any of these things and you would have these different frequencies playing through your years in, in that you basically trick your brain into producing these brainwaves.

Speaker 3:          00:45:25       And within minutes you feel like, oh, I just took a really nice nap. Like I feel good, I feel refreshed, that kind of thing. Wow. That would probably be great if you were in like a pool tournament or something like that. Like something where you want us to get into zones and get in the zone. Like I would think like archery or darts or something where you just like, or, or three pointers, you know, shooting three pointers. We just get into that field [inaudible], whatever that is, whatever that flow state is. Oh, you're thoughtless. Basically, you know, when you're in the Beta state that's, you were thinking, your mind is racing. That I was in the Beta state two nights ago when I, when I had three hours of sleep thinking of all these possible possible rabbit holes, we'd go down to conversation wise. Yeah. That's, uh, that, that state of the lack of sleep state is, uh, my shittiest thinking state.

Speaker 3:          00:46:13       I come up with my worst thoughts when I'm exhausted or can't turn the mind off. A lot of people have that issue. Yeah. Well the, um, there's also like some silly creative ideas though that come up when you're exhausted. Like sometimes when I'm exhausted I'll say the most ridiculous shit and it'll turn out to be funny. Like I have to write it down. Like where I'm like, you know, the writers on news radio, the Sitcom I was back in the day, they used to stay up late on purpose. They wouldn't start writing until two or three in the morning and they would get themselves into like an exhausted stupor and then they would start writing because all the running would be like really hilariously silly because they were just fucking falling asleep. They were just there just out of it. Like there's a state that you get that a lot of writers to try to trick themselves into just by like getting exhausted. Yeah. It makes sense. So when you were, when you're fighting, like what was the first sort of improvement path that you started upon diet nutrition right off the bat. That was the one where I was like, Hey, this is something I can control. It'll help me just recovery, you know, how do I recover faster? How do I flush metabolic waste? Um, yeah, there really was it. I mean, I've always been into supplements. I read the muscle mag since I was a little kid. That kind of thing. And uh, certain

Speaker 1:          00:47:30       stuff works, a lot of stuff doesn't. But really, um, what you put in your body has a huge impact. I mean, anybody who's ever cleaned up their diet and felt differently from it. When you're listening to red band talking about the wage loss and how he has the energy now, it just feels happy at it. Like, right. Well that's in rainmaker also. He talks about 80 percent of our serotonin is made in our guts bacteria. Eighty percent of our feel good hormone is made in our guts by bacteria. And that's great. What are you saying? Yeah. How do you think food does it impact that? We know every cell of our body is made from what we put in. So a lot of people don't think, oh, he eat this doughnut and it'll just. My body will change it into what it needs to be changed into bullshit.

Speaker 1:          00:48:09       No. And on top of that, you influence the microbiome, but what you put in your body, if you putting good stuff, it's easy to see like, yeah, of course you feel better. Yeah. We like to think of ourselves as independent from our food, but were actually made out of our food. That's completely. I was uh, I had salmon the other night at a restaurant and um, I said to my friend, I said to Tony, Tony Hinchcliffe, I was like, I don't think this is wild salmon. And he said, why? I said, because it's too light. It's too light colored. I don't, I don't, you know, they said it's a wild line caught salmon. And I'm like not really buying it. And uh, I said, you know, when you see wild salmon, it's more of a dark orange. And he said, well, why is that? I said, well, it's actually because of what they eat.

Speaker 1:          00:48:48       It's come on bugs like certain bugs that they eat or shrimp. What the fuck is it shrimper bugs find on West Santa Ana. Read, ask, ask, ask, ask, ask. US has sustained, and I know I'm butchering this asks us strengthen. It's like a and t h I n s sold in supplements. Sockeye Salmon, a salmon flush due to their diet. Sam, again, 99 percent or more of their body mass and the ocean, the foods they eat, but blah, blah, blah. I'm the food they eat in the ocean is high and carotenoids the same pigment that gives carrots color. These pigments are stored in their flesh. A salmon approaches their spawning grounds begin to absorb the scales. Huh?

Speaker 1:          00:49:31       Huh? They begin to absorb their scales. A weird. They, um, they get mushy. Have you ever caught a caught a salmon when it's dying? Banners. We went into, I had a bachelor party. My buddy goes up every year to Alaska, so we went fishing off the Kenai river, but we were, we just fit it in before his wedding, so we were about a month or two late to the party. It was a feast for Seagulls, like all these old timers that spawned and they're like swimming along, like just fucking, just full layers of skin and scale is just floating off of them ready to die. Yeah. They become mushy. Their flesh is like difficult to eat too. It's like disgusting. Yeah, it's nasty. Like you could eat it if you have to, if you want to stay alive, but they're literally breaking down and had a little sashimi and that was a.

Speaker 1:          00:50:19       That was a mistake for sure. You should never eat salmon Sashimi. Really? Yeah. Yeah. It's not a smart move because they have parasites, ocean fish or much better in regards to uh, being. So if you caught the salmon in the ocean, you're cool to do it. Then he even then, because they go there, they go back and forth. I think is something about fresh water fish are much more susceptible to, um, southern nasty shit we put in there probably. Yeah. I don't even know if it's nasty shit we put in there. I think that's just nature. I think fish in the ocean naturally are of a higher, less likely hood of a contracting. Any sort of parasites or you have a higher likelihood of getting it from. I'm a freshwater fish. Like you should never eat like large mouth bass. Like Sashimi. You shouldn't eat that.

Speaker 1:          00:51:09       I don't think. I really don't think I'm talking out of my ass here. I'm pretty sure of. I've read that you're not supposed to eat salmon Sushi, but people do. Yeah. People do and it doesn't. But anyway, point being this fish was really kind of Pale and then we were talking about like how weird it is that your food actually changes the color of your skin. And we were talking about black bears that eat blackberries and blueberries, like if you eat, um, they, they, like certain hunters will go after bears that are in the fall because the fall bears the gorge on blueberries and their flesh is just supposed to be unbelievably delicious. Like some of the best tasting meat you can get because they're their flesh. And then their fat itself is like a purple color from all the blueberries. Like it changes their actual physical flesh and it makes it absorb.

Speaker 1:          00:52:07       It just makes you think about all these people that are eating McDonald's twinkies and shit. Like what is their flesh? It's just high fructose corn Syrup and Trans Fats. Just dog shit. Just pumping through your testimony in college. Just any calories that can get ahold of just brutal. Well, you know, ultimately that stuff breaks down the protein and water and all the various aspects of it. But if that's all you eat, no wonder why so many people are depressed. If you look at the modern American Diet, you look at the modern American diet, the sedentary lifestyle, and then you look at the fact that people feel like shit. And what is depression? Well, there's all sorts of different kinds of depression. There's some depression that's absolutely caused by a chemical imbalance. Your brain's sick. You know, just like your liver can get sick and your lungs can get sick, your brain can get sick, but there's a whole lot of depression that I guarantee has to do with people with sedentary lifestyle, Shitty Diet, and just no, no real pushing of the body where your body never gets to flush it out.

Speaker 1:          00:53:09       Never gets to blow those hormones up. Never gets to get that blood pumping out. Argue. The brain gets sick because you let it get. That way. You stop moving and stop putting good things in your body. And then you have this downward spiral that just snowballs into deep depression that know your buddy coming over and it's going to cheer you up. Whatever it is, you're not going to snap yourself out of that just overnight and you're definitely not going to get it from popping a pill. I mean, you gotta get off your ass and move and start getting back out in nature. Yeah. To the pill thing is a weird one because I know for some people it's been very beneficial. I know people that were like severely depressed, they got an antidepressants and they eventually wean themselves off, but they got happy first. So it's like, what?

Speaker 1:          00:53:52       Did they need the pills? No, but the pills did help them and I wonder. I don't, I'm not going to indicate that at all, but I wonder what lifestyle choices did they make during that process as they started feeling better? Like, oh, I feel a little bit better. Sure, let's go for a hike. Whatever it is. Like what did they do in addition to that? Right. That helped them. So they don't have the pills now, right, because they're off the pills now. So how do you get to that point where you can be like a, I don't need this anymore. You know what, dudes that I know, one of them, he got married, fell in love, started his own business, his business became very successful, started doing really well in life, start feeling better about himself, and then it all sort of fell together and then he said, you know what, I'm going to get off these fucking pills, and he slowly weaned himself off and he's still happy and the other one got successful and got more confident and then realize that the pills were probably like dulling his senses and some sort of way and then slowly weaned himself off, but he hasn't really got into a exercise.

Speaker 1:          00:54:51       The other thing he did was he got off Propecia, that propecia shit that dudes do to keep their hair that took that and college stuff killed my Dick. Like a CHT blocker. Right? Yeah. Dht makes you a man, makes you bald, makes you have body hair. Don't want to get rid of that testosterone to get rid of that. Well, it can depress people. It can cause severe depression. Some people, you know, it didn't in me, but it definitely killed my deck, like a gun. That would make me depressed just right then. That's depressing. It doesn't totally kill it, but it's definitely. What beats the fuck out of it. Come on. What are you doing? Why are you doing this to me? Yeah. Well they say that you know, there's a, there's a balance that your hormones achieve and anytime you fuck with that balance with something like propecia that you know that blocks dihydrotestosterone, your body's like, all right, well what the hell is going on here?

Speaker 1:          00:55:43       Why is this block like, what? Wha Wha wha, wha. What is our issue here? And it can cause a cascade of issues like anytime you'd like to, to treat the body as anything other than a holistic approach. If you have a holistic approach, you look at this guy's depressed. Okay, well let's look at his diet. No, no, no, no, no. We need to get them on a pill. Well that doesn't make any sense. You need to look at the whole thing. Like what's his diet like? How often does he sleep? What is he? Does he drink a lot of water? Does he have something to get over? It's something that was fucking his wife die. His Dad's clean. His Shit. You know what's going on there. There's sometimes you just have to overcome. You just have to overcome a periods of life that just suck. That's, that's real too. You know what I, I mean, people want to

Speaker 3:          00:56:24       fix for that. Uh, give me a bill. I got to get past the stage of life. Only you're going to sleep through it. That's everything though with the, with the Western medicine. It's just that I'm broken. Fix Me. Let me go. You're the professional and fixed my knee. My hip pain medicine is the shit though. If you break your arm, they fixed my shoulder when I was a dumb ass and had a torn labrum. I love it for that. But what would happen to your shoulder would you do that? Was overtraining and uh, decided to try to Max out on barbell snatch and missed it with it. Didn't feel anything there. Then I waited a minute and reattempted the same weight and then I felt like it just felt like no strength at all. So it was a full slap tear came to the same thing it takes for a.

Speaker 3:          00:57:10       you're right, we've just been talking to people that have shoulder surgery. I think I thought I had this dumb ass idea in my head like, oh, you know, I'll be able to run still. And I'm like, no, you can't do any of that. I couldn't even walk. I had to be very careful with my arm in a sling for at least the first six weeks. Then at six months I could start rehab. It took me a whole year. We really did. And really I give a ton of credit to Kelly, start a for getting full range of motion back. The becoming a supple leopard guy and like I had for a long period of time thought like this is as far as my arm's going to go. Not quite that. Not Quite Hail Hitler, but you know, like I had no full range of motion.

Speaker 3:          00:57:45       I can get my bicep. Yeah. Couldn't get my bicep to my ear and I knew it was short in certain positions. Like if you get in grappling, Jujitsu, wrestling, things like that guy sprawls while you're holding a single leg that's nine, that three inches makes all the difference in the world. Like from feeling like, Hey, this guy's putting pressure on me, I should change positions or my arm's going to snap. Right? That's the difference. If you defending, looked a head and arm choke on the right side and someone tries to straighten your arm out, what does that like when he presses up against your head? Everything's fine now. But initially it was a nightmare. Yeah. Like just, I couldn't get biceps to ear while I'm talking to you. So for sure if someone's trying to do that to me, then it's going to feel like something's gonna tear six months before you can start doing rehab.

Speaker 3:          00:58:27       And that was a process that was, you know, just nasty. So, um, I know now listen to my body, don't push the envelope, nothing. You know? And then we slap tear. What does that mean? It's an acronym. It's the placement of the. What is it? The placement of will. The labor room is like the, it holds this ball in place. Right. So slap is the position of it. It's on the front side. I've, if I remember correctly, it was a few years ago, but um, yeah, it's all placement. All arthroscopic go in there and sew it back up. Is that what they did? Yeah. I have very, very minimal scarring there. But yeah, it's basically what it is. They just go in, they do everything through the, through the vision of the, the little cameras and it's easy. It's easy fix for them. And it had a great guy. He's worked on tons of NFL guys I got and I'm grateful that I have full recovery, but really it's, it's a nasty deal

Speaker 1:          00:59:22       to have to go through. Yeah. Tait Fletcher just went through something like this weekend. He went through something. He just texted me about a. hold on one second. It, uh, it's something called. This is really interesting shit, man. It's okay. It's called highland highland x injections there. Site injections, whether impediments to movement and um, anything they have with sliding tissue. Oh, there it is. Highland X. and uh, he was saying that, uh, it's an enzyme and that they're, they're testing on people that have joint issues and somehow or another it's supposed to mitigate the issues of mobility in a joint problems. I think I need to get my dad in that he gave. He can't open his arms as far as his arms go. How come you could arm bar? I'm like, the east got like calcium deposits and shit in his elbows. He's had surgery on both of them to him.

Speaker 1:          01:00:19       From what? Uh, you know, he's, he's eating cleaner now, but for years he ate whatever the hell he wanted and he still did. I mean he got his black belt a year ago. So he does. He's on the mat all the time. He does a lot of Jujitsu. I'm how old you done? Sixty four. That's amazing. Gets his black belt at 63. What a stud. He started at 56 dud. He was a fat loser with a super, super stressed job, you know, sales. And then when I started fighting, he got into Jujitsu. He did full contact karate, boxing, wrestling. So he understood, striking, understood. Wrestling, but the second hit the mat, he was like, I don't know what the fuck these guys are doing, like have to learn. And uh, once he started immediately became addicted. Like anybody who does Jujitsu, you know, the feeling you get when you first start and he lost 50 pounds without even changing his diet in the first six months.

Speaker 1:          01:01:14       So it was a, it's been a life changer for them for sure. That's fucking great. I love hearing that. Like Anthony Bourdain keeps saying he'll never get his black belt bullshit. That guy will get his black belt. He started when he was, I think 57 and he's got his blue belt now at 58. He'll get it for sure. He'll get it. He's a maniac. He takes one private and one full class. One, one regular class a day everyday, everyday, everyday cheese. Why not if you've got cheese? Yeah, he's got the cheese and he's also got the obsession. And you know, it's funny, I talked to Bj Penn about this. Bj Penn was hilarious about this. He was talking to this guy and the guy was like, you know, uh, he told you no, because Bj famously got his black belt in three years and one day, one day, all three years in, and this guy had gotten his black belt somewhere, I think around four years. And a Bj was like, well, he goes, man. He goes, you, you must be really talented. And he goes, no, man. He goes, I'm obsessed. He goes, I'm addicted. Like you, I'm addicted. And bj started laughing. He goes, I realized, yeah, I was addicted. I was addicted to like, you can get

Speaker 3:          01:02:20       addicted to good things too. Oh yeah, no question. I mean, that's, that, that is runners high. That's why people would sign up for a race that's, wait, it's not healthy for you to run that far, but it feels good training and preparing and getting your body ready for that. And that keeps you coming back for more. Yeah. Like 100 mile runs. Those are fucking terrible. Destroy you. They've got to be bad you. They've done blood work on people even not just after a marathon, which is ridiculous in its own right, but they would see like borderline kidney failure, like your kidneys can barely keep up with removing metabolic waste. Yeah. You don't look after those things and your piss looks like Coca Cola.

Speaker 4:          01:02:58       Well, I'm out. I'm out. No.

Speaker 1:          01:03:01       Oh, never want to get to the point where I p looks like coke. That's fucking terrible man. But people like they also get addicted to pushing themselves. That's a big one. You know, like my friend Cameron Hanes, he's a bow hunter, but he's also does ultra marathons. A lot of merit. He started getting in shape just so he could get up the mountains easier. Like cars in bowhunting. There's two things that come into play. One, you have to be fit in order to get up the mountains because all that hiking, it's exhausting, especially at high altitude and two, you have to be strong to be able to pack out. Like you carry an animal, you kill it and you have to get it down in the mountains. A lot of work. So those two things led him down this road of starting to do marathons and lifting a lot of weights and doing all these different things. But now he's doing ultra marathons. He's doing something called the big foot challenge. It's 200 miles. So I go 100 miles a day and the next day another hundred miles like

Speaker 3:          01:03:56       damn, I wonder what the cutoff is for that because sometimes they're right around like 22 hours. Just what do you do? You take an hour nap and then go right back to running. I don't even know if you sleep. I mean you probably in so much agony after 24 hours of running 200 miles. That's so stupid. 100 wasn't enough guys. It's weed out the policies here and they get 200 some lady in my neighborhood did it.

Speaker 1:          01:04:19       She. She did 200 fucking miles. She did a mile. One hundred miles one day. One hundred miles the next day.

Speaker 3:          01:04:25       Bitch is crazy. Yeah. I say bitch with all due respect and admiration. Damn. Yeah. I don't. I don't mean leslie anything wrong with her. She's just tough as shit. But they get addicted to like pushing them.

Speaker 1:          01:04:39       Sounds like there's a thing that comes to some people when they get involved in these heavy endurance races were part of the. The addiction is one more hour, five more miles, 10 more miles.

Speaker 3:          01:04:51       Just push your kid into a. You do get into a flow state and it does you. The longer you go, the better it feels. I mean obviously you can deal with ticketek injuries and things like that or whatever you got to deal with in the race. But at a certain point in time the mental chatter quiets down and you just find your rhythm and you find your breathing and that's, that can be meditative completely. And the longer it goes, the better for people like that. Once you're in that state, you know, I mean, I've, I've felt that in half marathons on the last six miles and finish stronger in the end than I did in the first half. You know? And I'm sure runners be like, oh yeah, of course we ran more. You'd know that dummy for that, that I get that. So that's why we sign up for this 50 k coming up just for the fact like, all right, Kelly started a 50 k at 230 pounds.

Speaker 3:          01:05:38       It can be done. Right? You know, and I'm not saying I'm going to make a regular habit of this, I don't think it's healthy by any means, but I do want to do it. A 50 is like a mile time, right? A marathon is what? It's a little bit longer to think. I think a marathon is 26 point two miles and a 50 k's run around 33. Oh, okay. That makes sense to point. Jamie would know the powers of, of Google, the powers of Google 31 miles. Jamie's a runner too. So, um, that's um, so is that what fuels your competitive desires now? I like doing different things, you know, like working out with Jesse burdick. He's the guy who does power, he's a beast. Uh, you know, so training once a week I'll go up and train with him and Dublin at CSA and we do some heavy, heavy lower body.

Speaker 3:          01:06:28       It could be anything. So we'll squat heavy. One day we'll do a heavy sumo deadlift, heavy conventional to whatever, you know, like there's just a, it's good to train with guys that are way better than you at whatever their respective thing is, you know, and I feel like I have, I can go in there and learn from him and the guys that got working out there. That doesn't mean a lot of good and I love lifting who doesn't want to be stronger. Like if you, once you get a taste for that, that is an addictive thing and I love lifting heavy weight because I feel better throughout the week. You know? I just feel better as a person doing that. When I'm in shape, I feel better being in shape. So going for longer distance runs and having something, you know, if there's light at the end of the tunnel, like April ninth, I'm running the 50 k.

Speaker 3:          01:07:10       That makes it easy for me to come home when I'm tired and say I got to get at least three miles in today. That kind of thing. You know, like I know this event's coming up so I'm going to put in some roadwork today and it doesn't fuck with your shoulder at all. This heavy lifting the shoulders. A hundred percent know why and I give full. I can't. I mean it sound like I'm blowing the guy, but Kelly start really. I have everything to thank from that guy. What did you do that he will have his banded mobility and you can look them on a mobilitywod.com. He posted 500 videos on youtube. He's got a shoulder one that's I think five minutes long and that long, but he shows eight different stretches for the shoulder using one of those rogue bands. Right? And you spent two minutes in a stretch minimum.

Speaker 3:          01:07:53       So there's 20, 32nd hold shit is out the window. He talks about Fascia in order to release it really has to be, have some time under tension and you know, you distract things. So I couldn't. I wouldn't get the same experience if I put my hand on a wall and try to stretch my chest. Right? But if I can pull in this band, it distracts the impingement in my shoulder and now the Fascia, the palm of my hand, and my thumb will go all the way to my ear lobe and open up a. So I'll feel everything the same way a foam roller can, can relax my it band right now. I can get that for my shoulder and all these different positions. And that's what gives me my mobility back. So the basic idea is that hey, I can be able to get in this position cold, right?

Speaker 3:          01:08:36       That's what I wrote. He name is booked at supple Leopard Leopard's. You don't see them getting up and having to do a five minute warmup guys and catch up with you in a second. You know, they're not, you know, I do downward dog upward dog and then boom, they're going right. So I have that ability, my shoulder now because of putting in that work over time. Well that's what a lot of fighters are realizing now. The importance of softness and flexibility and, and just to be pliable and you have to be mobile. Yeah, you have to be mobile. And to be rigid and stiff, it impedes movement, like I see it a lot from people when they're trying to kick. When I see guys kicking and I see like stiffness and like sort of a general lack of fluidity and the way they move, I can tell immediately I'm like, this guy's just not flexible enough to throw on these kicks.

Speaker 3:          01:09:20       And there's all this resistance from their supporting leg. There's resistance from the kicking leg and then there's resistance from their torso. You could see it all as they start throwing kicks and then the kick will come up instead of go across the hip, won't be high enough. That won't be as much a forward movement with the hip. Definitely could be mental too though. You know, I always looking back, honestly on my career, I fought stiff, stiff as fuck, right? Like really stiff. I never sparred. I never fought the way I sparred. Rather look at Luke rockhold and I'm like, that guy fights the way he spars. Like he doesn't give a fuck what's coming at him. He kicks beautiful. And with everything is thrown is with power, right? Yeah. So he mentally got to that point where he was just like, I know I'm going to destroy you and I'm not worried about what you.

Speaker 3:          01:10:03       How much difference was there with you with how you performed in the gym versus how much you, how you performed inside the octagon? The, I think it was a fairly big difference. Like a 30 percent difference. Twenty percent difference. I don't know how, if I could put a number on it, I just felt like, you know, I mean there's. Hmm. I mean it's hard to gauge with a guy like cain. Cain destroyed everyone, you know, it'd be like, Oh, you know, there's this time I sparred Kane and I got them like, no, you can't whoop my ass every time we spark. But there was a point in time where I did well with Daniel. Cormier are times where I did well with Luke rockhold times where I did well with Mike Kyle and, and pull them Otello and you know, even in my best fights in the UFC, like with Ricardo Ramiro, think those.

Speaker 3:          01:10:46       The only time I got to get interviewed by you afterwards, it took me like a. The only reason the fight turned out that way and I was able to get into the zone was because I was so sick the night before. I fought like two. Oh eight. Like I had fucking sweat the bed. I was rolling around in my sweat, just soaked a bed. This worst fever I've ever had and in the fight I'm walking out and I was guest. After two minutes of warming up, I stopped warming up in the in the locker room completely gassed and I thought like, I'm fucked if this thing goes longer than men and I'm done. And then I realized right then Brian, when they shut the cage door, I have to fight. There's nothing I can do here but fight and right when I made that realization, that put me in the zone because there was no thought.

Speaker 3:          01:11:30       That's why the fight is 23 seconds. Whatever it was. It felt like it was in slow motion and I could never get back to that point because they didn't have the technical skills mentally to do it, or there's the knowhow of how I got there. You know, like I knew I could look back in hindsight and say, yeah, that's, this was the catalyst. I had my back against the wall and I just completely let go. I know from Iowasca ceremonies and things like that, like there's a big lesson in letting go and surrendering to the process is like don't fight it. Just fucking go with uh, but those things didn't transfer the way I had hoped. You know, I talked about that before my last fight. I hoped that the lessons I learned from Iowasca of surrender would transfer and I would have this like, I don't give a fuck mentality.

Speaker 3:          01:12:15       We're going to do this. And looking back on that fire, I didn't. I was still nervous to show, even though looking at photos online and you know, pat's going to punch me. I wasn't afraid of getting punched. No offense to pet cummins. I wasn't afraid of getting punched by him. Not after glover and in MANITOWOC and I'm still like, I'm squeezing the low fat, you know, right as he's about to hit me. Like I'm stiff, rigid tents. So there wasn't a transfer there of, of skills from the beauty of Iowasca because it wasn't, you didn't know enough time to process it or you needed more of those experiences or there was a really, there's a number, you know, there's a large, large, there's a. everything kind of goes together with that. I think, um,

Speaker 2:          01:13:03       really, you know,

Speaker 3:          01:13:05       spending time developing yourself longer, right? Having a, there's no eight week camp where I'm going to be as good a wrestler is that guy, period. It doesn't matter who I'm working with. Um, that said, obviously you can build a game plan and work on take down a fence and look it over in. St Louis did great against him. He was an excellent fight. So I could, you know, like in hindsight maybe it could have done it like that, you know, maybe I could have had better footwork and done these things and worked on whatever. I don't know. I don't really put too much thought into how I could've done that better now because I have really accepted the fact that I'm done doing that. You know, like the more I would put thought into how I could've done it better, the more it makes me want to do it. Right. Does that make sense? What was the big deciding factor to make you want to retire? It really, really was a, a number of things. But

Speaker 3:          01:13:58       you know, I had a second job the whole time I was in the UFC. Even with the fight, the fight of the nights at to fight of the nights. I got to train full time for maybe six months and then the first loss I had to go right back to work. So bouncing at the titty bar, bartending, managing that kind of stuff. And um, you need sleep for recovery. And I had that just felt that window of I can sleep and train full time and know what it's like to have full recovery now it's yanked back away from me. Why was it yanked back away? Because you, when you lost, who made less money? Is that what it is? Yeah. And, and well, with the fracture to like even take for example, when I had a uh, one of those fights, I got fight of the night with Maldonado.

Speaker 3:          01:14:42       That was my only fight that year. So I got an extra 40 grand. That's when I was getting 10 and 10. That's 60 grand, 10 percent coaches, 10 percent of management pay the irs. That's not a lot spread over the year and it's less than a teacher. So I needed to work, you know, and then that's Kinda how it goes. If you have you, if you, if you get hurt in a fight and you only fight that once that year, that could be the, the difference. Yeah. It's ridiculous. When you think about how much risk versus reward there is in the sport of fighting, like at the very high levels. Like when you're conor mcgregor or Ronda Rousey, yeah, you're going to make millions of dollars. But on the way up to that like, fuck, can you break through, you know, that's really what it comes down to. And at the same time I was, you know, becoming familiar with Iowasca was having a ceremonies where a lot of shit was getting uncovered.

Speaker 3:          01:15:36       And I don't mean like, Oh, I've worked through all this baggage and all. No, there was, there was V, I had many, many great visions and each ceremony has its own. It's its own thing. It's completely unique from another same thing with dmt that it's its own fucking thing. And it helped me grow as a person. I can't say which ceremony made me not have that spark. But over time that spark went away. The spark to want to destroy another person slowly left me. And it doesn't matter what a fighter tells you on a flight because of this, a fight, because of that, they all inside them want to destroy another person. Deep down inside they want to destroy something. Well, that's what victory is. Yeah, you have to want to. That victory is you submit someone or UK on them. I mean that's the ultimate victory.

Speaker 3:          01:16:25       You stopped them and that's really difficult to do. So the, the challenge is extremely high. And then the reward, the endorphins, the rush, the feeling of accomplishment, all those things. But at the end of the day, I think probably what Iowasca and what dmt would show you is that, uh, you know, you're causing damage. It's just this destructive thing, you know, there's no way around it even if you both sign up for it. And even if the guy talks shit before the fight. Yeah. It doesn't matter what he does, it's, it's A. Yeah, I dunno, I bet it would be really hard to handle if it was a mismatch, like say if a, if you took Iowasca and you had this vision and then you were supposed to fight somebody who, you know, like in your heart was really fucked. Like maybe they had bad stand up or something like that.

Speaker 3:          01:17:17       And you knew they weren't gonna be able to take you down. Like this guy is going to get lit up. Like, sorry dude, you're, you're under a false illusion of your abilities. You know, that that would make it very difficult. I would just, I would imagine. Yeah. Well, I mean, you still see guys know, like they kind of snap out of it when they have the opportunity to crush someone whose life lists and the referees still hasn't stopped them and then they pull back. So there's moments there and there's also moments where you're just, you know, you got the blinders on and it's like this guy, you know, I don't give a shit when the rep comes in. Yeah. So it was, I was asking you think that started you off this, uh, on this trip of retiring because how old are you now? Thirty three.

Speaker 3:          01:18:00       Thirty three. So you're still athletically, you're still in your prime. I feel better than I've ever felt in my life. Physically, mentally, emotionally. Does it ever like fuck with you every now and then does there, is there ever like a little thing and signing, like, come on guys. If I watch, that's why I stopped striking. Like you sharpen the blade, you want to test it, you know, I still do. I'll do Jujitsu the rest of my life, but I can't strike if I strike, I know I'll have that itch really. You know, I'll have the itch to spar and from sparring I'll, you know, I'll have a couple of good days and your who, who am I testing that against world champions. So if I fucking hang right next shortly, you should be able to apply this to guys that don't have a belt wrapped around their waists.

Speaker 3:          01:18:42       Yeah. But uh, you know, the more I've learned on a living, listen to like Dr Rhonda, Patrick and people like that I've had my face broken twice to act like that doesn't have permanent effects. I mean, it's ridiculous to think like, Oh, you know, it's just an orbital fracture. No, the guy fucking smashed my face. Like there's for sure longterm damage there that I'm not. Maybe not feeling it right now, but that's an issue I have to address. And the guys only a couple of years older. I'm 33, 35, 36 and they start to slow down a little bit or a. sorry I was getting audio and just one of your new. Did it pop off sometimes I think disconnects a little bit. See where the connection is. There we go. Okay. Um, yeah, you see if I can notice it in other people who are just a couple of years older than I know that's what's going to happen because it's not.

Speaker 3:          01:19:38       I mean, you watch a guy like randy couture fight and you're like, oh, that he's in everyone's face and suck grinded on dudes. He even with always been knocked out and things like that. He didn't stand in Bang with a lot of people. Like there's not, I can't think of many fights. Even when when bonner crushed me for 15 minutes and laid on me and didn't attempt much, I just took a beating in that fight. You know, when I, when I fought glover, I had no broken bones, but that's the only fight where I was lost leaving octagon. Bob Bob left and I didn't know how to get back to the locker room and I didn't want to ask anyone because I didn't want a longer suspension, a medical suspension. I mean he fucking buried two hooks after slipping my left right Combo, one left hook.

Speaker 3:          01:20:23       Then I throw it again. He slips berries. That same exact spot in the temple. And I mean, that's the only fight where I literally did not know where the locker room was and I was wandering around talking to people, making small talk. Like, oh, hey, how's it going? Yeah, that was a tough fight. Oh yeah. But I didn't know. I didn't know where anything was. And then I finally made have been. I was like, Oh fuck dude, that's bad. That's really bad. So you didn't want to ask anybody because you didn't want a longer medical suspension. Yeah. Whoa. So that I felt the effects there on the brain. I didn't feel the effects from the orbital fractures, but I could see the effects. Right. And then, you know, you see a couple of guys just a couple of years older, slowing down a little bit and you learn about health and being holistic and nutrition.

Speaker 3:          01:21:11       And what am I doing for myself to be a better person? How can I live, get more out of life? Where's my quality of life? Right. Well, if I'm doing that and then that's where I could drink. And if I want to alter my consciousness, there's a better way to do it than with that shit. Right. And there shouldn't. It shouldn't be a double edged sword. When did you quit drinking? A January sixth. The last time I drank of this year, last year in Peru. Hold last year I was a, I did a ceremony in Columbia and uh, the guy was talking about addiction to things and I never felt addicted at all to drinking, but I definitely drank like an asshole for sure many, many times. Uh, you know, but he, he had mentioned next time you drink, ask what you were feeding. Everything we put in our body is feeding something, ask what you're feeding.

Speaker 3:          01:22:00       And it just didn't hit me then, but later on in the ceremony, it really stuck in like I could see all the, the destructive behavior of, Oh yeah, let's party. Let's go balls to the wall. And you're like, hey, yeah, slapping five and just, you know, college, Spring Breaker, Asu type Jock, meathead, you know, more and more and more and more, more. And then just the destruction, the toll it was taking on me, you know, especially as you get older, like you can drink like that when you're young, but you get to 30 something stops working, you're hangovers last a little longer, you know, everything. It's harder to keep up with, you think it's also, you're aware, I think when you're young, like I remember being hung over when I was young, but I was so unaware of how that, like what I put in, how it affected my body.

Speaker 3:          01:22:44       Um, I just thought of myself as I was in such a fog of confusion when I was young. Just trying to get through life that I don't think I was aware of my body. Like I am aware of now. Like now if I do things like just changing my diet, I'm like really tuned into what kind of effect it's happening, if any. I'm trying to figure it out. I'm much more aware. When I was in my twenties, I don't know if I necessarily recovered from hangovers better, but I didn't notice it as much because I was just dumb. Yeah. Well yeah, there's a, what are we doing now? Let's get pizza, you know, cracked another beer. It, get rid of that, whatever that. Yeah, I'm with you on that. I do feel like there are, as you age, your organs just don't keep up the same, you know, and I feel like that was a big can, but really just the, the reflection for me of seeing how I behaved with that versus like if I wanna if I want to feel different, thanks to the wonderful people in California that allow medical cannabis, I can feel different, right?

Speaker 3:          01:23:43       I could sleep like a baby and I can wake up with zero hangover. Yeah. And I'm not going to get fat from it. I'm not going to feel like shit. I'm not going to underperform the next day. Mentally or physically. You also get benefits from it. Like many bins. The antiinflammatory benefits, the mental benefits of it, the sensitivity benefits, the comradery that it sort of stimulates. There's a lot of sense of community that comes with smoking cannabis. It makes you like a more generous and nice person and a lot of ways. But alcohol man, it has its place. I mean I think it's fun in a lot of ways, but boy, it's so abused, but in, in this culture and our culture, it's so. It's so commonly abused by so many people and they don't even consider it. They just pound them just fucking abuse pot too.

Speaker 3:          01:24:36       There's no doubt about that. When I was in college, I abused pot actually here in Graham Hancock. Talk about his relationship under podcast with cannabis and how Iowasca showed him that and he quit for awhile until coming back on the podcast and spoken with you. But yeah, that was great because evil kind kinda do the same thing for me. It didn't show me my relationship with weed that way. It actually reversed it, but it showed me that my relationship with alcohol that way and I don't need it, but it also showed me like, hey, cannabis is a plant cannabis. A Dan Hardee said in one of his visions when he asked, I have asked about cannabis. Cannabis is my sister was the answer. Like this is another one of these is another teacher. This is another tool. This is here for you, use it, right, and I think that if you treat it with respect and you have an intention and a reason why you're doing it and it's not, there's a time and a place for a man.

Speaker 3:          01:25:26       I just want to get bombed and feel out of this world or I'm going to push the envelope and maybe do a mega dose and jump into a float tank, which I still need to try. But uh, you know, for the most part you can have relatively small amounts of things like that and completely improve your quality of life with zero repercussion. Yeah, because you put in the time and you have the right intention of this is what I want to use it for. Right? Yeah. Repercussions that it is something you have to weigh action versus repercussion. And with alcohol, the repercussions are just fucking devastating over time. It's just such a fucking unfortunate one. They think they've figured out a way to create alcohol without any

Speaker 1:          01:26:04       hangover. There's been some new research on something that gives you like an alcoholic effect, but it doesn't give you a hangover. I hope it's not like synthetic weed or something isn't right. That weirdo knockout shit. I always wonder what effects on internal organs fighting has not just done the kidneys, which we know get really fucked up. Overweight, cutting. It's really bad for you. A kidney stones are one side effect that some people seem to suffer from dehydration, from weight cutting. I know all those had some kidney stones. A lot of fighters have had kidney stones there. They're really common for guys who cut a lot of weight, but also I would just wonder just body kicks and knees the body and punches. I mean how many times he get kicked in the liver before it does damage to your liver. I mean if alcohol is bad for your liver, what does a Shin do to it?

Speaker 1:          01:26:53       You know, what is what is a fucking vicious left hook to the liver? Just getting by lasted. Yeah. Yeah. I wonder, I don't know if there's any mean. We constantly consider the stress on the brain and the damage to the brain from head impacts and brain trauma, but what about body trauma? I always wonder about that because I've seen guys get fucking blast today. Good. We know that. It's like you watch a guy eat a liver shot and the fights over from a body kick it. Oh, he's, yeah. Rub some dirt on it and he's fine. No, just ended the fight. No.

Speaker 1:          01:27:30       So when you look back at your career and you look back at all these wars and all these crazy fights that you got in, do you, um, do you think about the damage? Do you, is it something you just like put aside and you know, that there probably was some done and just just move forward and stay positive and be healthy from here on out and I don't. Here's one thing that I disagree with people when they say, like, you know, when we grew up they said, oh hey, you have a set number of brain cells and whatever you lose, you're not going to get back. And so, so we now know that's bullshit. Like our brain can create new cells. Neurogenesis happens and the more you do, the more new stuff you do, whether it's learning an instrument or a new language or taking a different trail to hike, whatever, that helps strengthen these new pathways.

Speaker 1:          01:28:19       Right, and make you smarter and just keep your brain young. Yeah. I don't think for one second that anything that I'd done in my career can't be overcome or that I can't really feel like from diets like this and supplementing with mcts and different things like that. I feel quicker now in sharper now than I ever have in my life mentally so that that's good, but that said, I don't. I don't look back and say, oh, this did this to me. I look back and say, I don't want to do more of that. Right. Yeah. That's a good way of looking at it. I'm A. I've talked about this in the podcast when you heard about Bill Roman Polanski created that neuro one supplement specifically because of his football career, because all the head impacts that he had seven memory issues, a bunch of issues with his brain.

Speaker 1:          01:28:59       I wonder what's in it. You know what the product is, I don't have it here, but uh, the uh, sent me a couple of tubs of it because I talked about it a bunch of times and um, it's not something that we sell at on it. It's just something I love. It's just good. Uh, and uh, it's the first neutral pick ever tried before we created Alpha brain. And um, do you stack them now? No, I just, I rarely try neuro one, but I liked to do different things. I like to do. I like to occasionally try Prasad, I'm way into nootropics. Yeah. You tried to interest the Tamar Roxy arrested him? Yes, I have. How do you like the difference? Um, it's hard to tell, you know, that's one of the things about like I had a conversation with a dude last night at the comedy store.

Speaker 1:          01:29:40       It was really funny because it was hilarious because the dude was hammered, right? He's like, man, I fucking tried off a brain, but uh, shit, I don't know if it worked, like, okay, define worked. Like what are you doing? It's just fucking hanging, hanging out man. But I don't if it didn't feel any difference, I go, okay, it's not, it's not like going to make you smarter with the idea behind it is if you're, if you're involved in a task. Like for me, here's Alpha brain in nootropics are really critical for me because I rely on my memory a lot. Like when I'm doing the UFC it's a big factor. I'm constantly bringing up past fights and I'm constantly talking about different situations and transitions and you know, this happens when you do that and it, all these connections that I have to make my brain.

Speaker 1:          01:30:30       So verbal memory, recalling fights, things like that. New nootropics are critical for that kind of thing. But if you don't have anything that requires your memory, how do you know if it's working? If you don't have anything that requires you to form sentences on the fly, how do you know if it's working? Like so? I think he just had a silly idea. I think he thought that he was going to take this stuff and all of a sudden he's like, man, I know what I'm doing with my life. Like the fucking light bulb goes, got uploaded from the matrix with some. I get it. I get it all, man. I didn't feel it, but it was hilarious because he was fucking hammered. Dude was hammered. He's like, I don't know if I felt it. I'm like, okay dude. First of all, how? How Shit faced?

Speaker 1:          01:31:10       Are you right now? He's like, I'm poor. Junk. Like, well, this conversation is going to be weird anyway. You know, you're probably not going to remember what I'm saying, but if you had to do something, it was important and I explained all the different things that has been shown clinically in double blind placebo controlled studies to improve on like these statistics like you can. You can show it when you can show with 60 people and you could show that the people that take it have these effects versus the people that don't take it like this is. This is where it will help you, but it's not. It's not going to just make you smarter. But for someone who relies on their mind a lot, whether it's for creativity or for me, I like to take it now even before I work out. I started doing it before a workout now and I'm noticing less fatigue.

Speaker 1:          01:31:53       My mind stays fresh longer, like in grueling longterm workouts, like, like a long series of pad workouts. I can, I can maintain my concentration like deep into the seven, eighth and ninth round of hitting pads. I don't fade off as much. Like where I can't remember the combinations, you know, you get so tired, you're like okay, what is it again? Double Jab, right hand, left hook, right kick step, knee. Got It. And then you know, you're into the left hook and you're like, what the fuck is next? Because you're so tired, your brain doesn't work that good. So I think mental fatigue can contribute to physical fatigue or 100 percent that's in the his book also talk about how ketones are, are pretty much the steady fuel. So your brain doesn't bonk because there's an unlimited stream of energy coming in at all times. You don't hit the window where you run out of glycogen in your brain as the master regulator says, wait a minute.

Speaker 1:          01:32:45       No, no, no, no, no, no. We, we have a very low supply here. It's finite. Nothing else is coming in. So we're going to downregulate everything and make you perform like shit right now in an effort to hold onto what we have. You know, you don't ever hit that wall with the ketones present in the blood. Well, I've never been in the key to genic state. I don't think I've don't. Do you ever fasted for anything? Yeah, maybe. Maybe like 12 hours. I've never done that leg work several days. No. I mean even like fasting is just deciding. I don't feel like eating right now, you know, I've never consciously decided to fast. It's just pretty cool. Yeah. This is an interesting experiment because, um, I just said, well, you know, there's nothing to lose. Here is nothing is going to fuck me up. I'm just going to give this a shot and see what happens.

Speaker 1:          01:33:30       I was a little flat yesterday, like trying to push through. I'm a elliptical workout was a little flat, but nothing huge. Just a required a little more grit, you know, just required me to dig down what I would rather just get off that fucking thing. And around the 35 minute mark, like the last 10 minutes were pretty rough, but other than that, my brain doesn't seem too foggy. That was one of the things I was concerned with that I go on stage and I'd just be stupid. Like my brain doesn't work that good. I'd forget what I was talking about, but what do you do you blend. I mean, do you do bulletproof style where you blend butter and it just says, okay. Yeah, this is at least some help. I want to check you out. Actually I brought in what's check you out, bro Bro. I know I've told you about this briefly here. Yes, you did. What is, if you're not, if you're not checking your guessing. So one of the things about these ketogenic diets is you gotTa, you gotta act like you're diabetic, you get a blood ketone monitor these strips her finger or something. Yeah, I'm going to. I'll give you a fresh one here so you don't need my Yo. Could I get aids from you? Maybe from Jenny trip. Jenny high five.

Speaker 1:          01:34:42       All right. So what he's got here is some little thing that you. Little pricker. So what is it like a needle or something joe? My little prick. It's A. Does it matter lance? It, I think is what they call it doesn't matter. No. So what we have here is a blood ketone strip.

Speaker 2:          01:35:04       Oh yeah. You're nice and hot.

Speaker 1:          01:35:06       Well, what you want there to be warmth in your hands or otherwise it's a motherfucker. Did that make blood? I didn't even feel that. That's so weird. I didn't feel bro. So tough. I am Bro. Little blood on it up. Well you're going to have to feel another one here. God dammit. I'm going to feel this one now. I was talking shit. So what he's got is this little punch thing. Almost like little state board move.

Speaker 1:          01:35:32       Not One. I didn't feel at all like the other one. I felt it touched my finger. That one didn't work. That's why. Let me give you a brand new one here. What's my skins to dick, bro? I got double skin thick. It's not, you know, all those years of training and the Maki Warrah board. I do a lot of, a lot of work. You know what Mackey Juarez folks, if you don't know karate guys, they take up a board and it's like sort of a nailed to the ground or dug into the ground and sort of locked in place and the board will give a little bit and they wrapped the board up with a rope so it's really hard. And then he punch it and develop these callous, these thick calluses on their knuckles and then they would go from that to brick work. My friend John Lee back in Boston, he used to have his, his right, his index finger and his fuck you finger than knuckles to those fingers were fused.

Speaker 1:          01:36:30       It would be. It was one big fat rhino. Not Goal and it was all just from one big knuckle. Yeah, it was all from him punching shit. That is the last guy you wanted punching you. He's punching through bricks and shit. You know, your pussy little needle things are not working on my fucking savage skin. Is it working this time? God debit. Well you got some bitch ass needles you need to get here. So basically bro, I have to figure this out. Sorry. So does it work different on different people's that what's going on for real, like no bullshit. Just do people have thicker skin wise here we can go deeper but I'm, I'm trying not to be a Dick and put it on the highest setting and punches into your setting. I'm going to flex while you do it. It's actually the stress of you. Um, there's hold on to my hand and shoving that thing over and over again with no pain. I'm like eventually I'm going to feel pain. So it's like if I just felt pain the first time but it'd be very minimal. We've got now you got a razor blade in there. I'm putting it in a new test strip. Just to double check here and explain to me what this thing is testing for. There's a little blood on my fingers.

Speaker 2:          01:37:44       Yeah, we want more. Did he feel that? Barely. Damn.

Speaker 1:          01:37:51       Go deep son. Don't be scared. I do. Double check. Ryan. I'll Jamie, she added in

Speaker 3:          01:37:56       there. Hey, I don't like that phrasing is not working. Huh? A goddamn. It'll allow you to just fucking tapped this thing. Okay. What do you do? We don't want you to just tap it. Well, what is it? It's a fucking little needle. Alright, I'm just shove it in there. There you go. Shove it in there. Pull it out. Now. Make yourself bleed a bit. Give me a drop. Put her on this bad boy. So good. Could be man. I shoved that all the way in. Yeah. I want you to. You did. Oh, there we go. That's okay. Don't worry folks. Okay, now we got it. We got some sweet blood. Now we've got a countdown here. Ten seconds. It's going to tell us your blood ketones. So basically you want to be between zero point five.

Speaker 2:          01:38:50       Oh,

Speaker 3:          01:38:52       what does it say? Low. Low. What does that mean? Low battery. Low battery or low key ketones. Me? Yeah. Really? It doesn't make sense. Let's do another show. I'm bleeding. I know we got you. I got some good blood here, another strip. Keep it up. Keep the bloodline open. Squeezes bitch. Fucking junk science or go. Is this bro? Science Bro. Bro. Science bro, bro Bro. Alright, one more test here. Okay.

Speaker 3:          01:39:25       Three, two, one. Zero point one. What does that pathetic. That's terrible. You want to be between zero point five. About three point. Oh, and you can go higher than that if you're like in a really extended fast or if you take exogenous ketones. Right? And then you go above three point. Oh, but basically zero point five, you're in nutritional ketosis given one more test. Just to be sure that this isn't bullshit because I'm not certain. I believe you're fucking stupid machine. If it varies, that's a problem, right? If you do it again and you get a devastating yeah, that would be a problem. I don't know that I'm going to get it. Why is that was about all that blood to step well, because it's got to come in a little dry just to have it again.

Speaker 3:          01:40:28       What's the negative of being where he's at at point one? I'm going to stab it again. Well, he's in no man's land, so he doesn't have carbohydrates coming in right to fuel his body and he's not producing ketones. So did you work out beforehand? Yeah, that's why is that just fucking saw. Should have asked beforehand. So whatever ketones you have from the mcts your body's using. Oh, that's why your blood ketones aren't high. I worked out right before I got it. That's exactly. Yeah. It's going to confirm it here, but that's exactly why. So I've, I've tested, I've been in Ketosis for awhile and tested and seen like zero point three and I'm like, what the fuck? And then I listened to dominic d'agostino. Talk about that your body will use with the ketones out. That's why you're producing. It's an energy source. So you work out. That's going to go to fill your body the way the blood glucose would have prior to that. What is [inaudible]? It means it's cold. You know what I'm saying? What does that mean machine? I don't know.

Speaker 3:          01:41:27       It's too cold. I guess it's too cold machine. The machine. The machine is cold. So what do you do? Do you heat it up? Put it in the microwave. I stick it in my armpit when I'm getting ready. The machine? Yeah, just right here. Boom. Okay. So warmer, but it's. I just prepped myself for nothing that you did. Pick yourself for nothing. What are all these things that you're sticking in there? What are all those things? But these are all the. The. This is your trash actually. That's your little. I don't know where you've been. Basket. That's a. What are those things in there? Those are the bits that poke you and then the test strips, but any ways you would do this at night before? Usually before dinner, if you're going to have the highest ketones, then if you have a night workout then have at least a couple of soft right now so I could see what you get.

Speaker 3:          01:42:11       I'm out. You're out. You put the last one, the last trip to you. Oh sorry. You got the written. Ah, it's all good. I've got more at the house, but. So you carry these around. You just do it once a day or how many times do they do? There are a few bucks a piece, so I usually just do them at night. Um, when the ketones are highest just to make sure that I'm nutritionally, they're a mct oil. It's usually worn off by that point, so I can tell like, am I producing my own ketones as opposed to just getting it artificially raised from the MCTs. Oh, I see. Okay. It doesn't need to be three point zero. If it's zero point five, I'm good, but I will feel the difference when I reached the one point. Oh, between one point. Oh, and two point. Oh, one point. Oh, and two point. Oh One, I zero point one. Zero point one. Yeah, that's dog shit. But it doesn't mean anything because you just worked out. I'm depressed.

Speaker 3:          01:43:01       Okay. So what I'm shooting for though is a zero point five or higher. Anything above that, five or higher. But you've gotten to one or two. I've been above three point. Oh, from fasting or from exogenous ketones. But if I'm on a daily basis between one point. Oh and two point. Oh, then I'm doing good and that means the foods I'm putting in my body. I haven't exceeded my protein limits and Claus Gluconeogenesis or any of these things like I'm. I've dialed in my nutrition over time and that's what it is. It's just fine tuning. Right? Like women can process much more carbohydrates than weekend on a ketogenic diet. Really more. Yeah, way more. I don't know if it's because of the hormones and the menstrual cycle or because they're evil. I have no idea, but they can get away with way more. Could it be evil?

Speaker 3:          01:43:45       Just some. Some food. That's interesting. I wonder what that has meant. Wonder if it's because they have to maintain a higher body fat to make lacto to make milk and to. It's possible feed the baby and grow. Titties. Tossed. Yeah. Tosh was in Ketosis the whole time during the pregnancy and she still had plenty of carbohydrates. That's interesting. And this was so it was a conscious decision to, to reach that state during the pregnancy? Not at all. No, no, no. She was, she. She asked me like, Oh hey, he would see where I'm at and I'm like, I'm going to waste $3 on you right now. You're at zero point zero. I just told you what you're at. Right? It's like, no, seriously. I want to see like I feel good. You know, it's okay. So we did it and she was higher than I was.

Speaker 3:          01:44:28       Whoa. I was like, what the fuck? But it makes perfect sense. I mean if you're sending resources to build a human right, you know, and you want that steady flow, it makes sense. The body would produce that in a situation like that just in case you ran out of carbohydrates. It is interesting because women, oftentimes when they're pregnant, they crave a really fatty foods, like the crave ice cream and things along those lines, but that's not ketogenic, right? Because it has a lot of sugar in it. Well, there's sugar in that. Yeah. Your cravings, your cravings, but you want to. If there's a, if there's a calling to have more fat, you want more fat, that doesn't necessarily mean it's going to put you in ketosis right now. If you say, if you're in this key to genic state and you eat some carbohydrates, you eat like a big bowl of pasta, how much does it whack you out of that ketogenic state? Three to four. Three to four days is typically what it would take to get back in bed. Put it this way. I mean because I've been in and out of it for as long as I have and because I work out the way you work out, you know, high intensity stuff with kettlebells or I'll go for a distance from whatever and then still train on the mat. That's high intensity when you're grappling.

Speaker 3:          01:45:34       I had a Saturday. We went off the deep end. I had to gluten free pizzas with Tosh and we had a bunch of gluten free cookies and the fricking leader of this awesome grass fed milk loaded with carbs and I probably had 500 grams of carbohydrates. Grass fed milk is loaded with carbs. Milk for sure. Milk is long period. Doesn't matter if it's aggressive. It matters if it's grass fed or grain fed, but not from a carbohydrate standpoint. Nobody would think that milk would be a source of carbohydrates. What? Nine to 12 grams per cup, so if you have a leader in your, you have four cups, which is easy to do and read and cookies that you just had 50 grams of carbs just from the milk. Whoa. How many grams of carbs? You're supposed to have a day in a in a ketogenic diet between 30 and 50 during the Keto adaptation phase, which is six to eight weeks, and then after that you can play, but that's the whole reason you check because if you're doing 50 grams a day thinking, Hey, I'm going within my limit and you're still at point three, point four and fuck with somebody else tells you that's when it's time to dial it down a bit.

Speaker 3:          01:46:34       Or maybe my, my, my carbohydrates are fine, but I'm still not in Ketosis. That means you're eating too much protein or maybe I need to add more fat to my meals. So the ratio is there and they talked about it. John Hopkins, they were talking about for the, for the kids with epilepsy, four to one ratio of fat to protein and carbohydrates combined. Now that's pretty. It's pretty hard to do if you think of how many you eat a steak, there's 50 grams of protein and there's equal amount of fat. Let's say, now I have to multiply that by four and if there's any carbohydrates to add to that, then add that to the total for the four to one ratio, so you're going to have just ridiculous amounts of fat to to accomplish that. What is that device called that you just use? It's a blood ketone meter.

Speaker 3:          01:47:17       I use the Nova Max. One is the cheapest. There's a couple other ones that are five or $6 a strip. You can get that on Amazon. The meter itself is only like 20 bucks and then the strips are a little bit more and so the strips, you have to use blood. Is there another way to do it? There is a piss test, which doesn't work at all. Um, the problem with that is once your body becomes keto adapted, it learns how to better use these things so they're not excreted in the urine. So when it tests for acetone, I think is a cdot Acetate, something like that, it's one of the less prominent ketones to begin with. So when we convert fat into Ketones, we have three major ketone bodies. Beta hydroxy butyrate is the one that you test for with the blood strip that's the most 80 percent most abundant in the blood.

Speaker 3:          01:48:03       If you do the urine strip and your body's becoming Keto adapted, well, you're not gonna piss anymore out. So you could be completely in nutritional ketosis and use a strip and be like, hey man, I'm not in Ketosis. What's going on? And it's not that at all. It's just that your body's not wasting any out of the urine anymore. Then they have breast strips or breath. The breath meter you can blow into and I can't stand the thing. I used it for awhile. I tried to get into it because it's obviously you can reuse it at 100,000 times and it's still going to be the same cost, but uh, it shows like a, on a gliding scale, like an led light. So green is not in Ketosis, red is in Ketosis, whatever. And then in between you have like green, yellow and yellow, orange. It's all, it's so fucking hard to read and then you're trying to figure out, well I feel, you know, it's no, no, no, no.

Speaker 3:          01:48:51       Just to do the blood, get, get me to the 10th. Exactly where I'm at. And then you get to all the guests workout and what exactly is it measuring? Like when you say blood ketones. So what is the number represent? One millimolar is a measurement of the Beta hydroxybutyrate ketone millimolar millimolar. Hm. Wow. So you've been doing this for awhile. Yeah, I've read a ton of books on it. And the thing is, you know, most diets people, I've tried a ton of different diets. This one you feel good. You can eat as much as you want. Like when Dave aspery talks about eating 4,500 calories a day and working out whatever he said, 15 minutes of fucking month or whatever. Some nonsense. Yeah, here you are going to lose weight. I'm a better example in the four hour body, Tim ferriss talks about the study they did on calories in, calories out.

Speaker 3:          01:49:38       I love this study. Three, three groups of people had 2000 calories a day. One group a 90 percent carbs, groupie 90 percent, Group C, 90 percent fat, not Shaked out. Carbohydrate group gained one and a half pounds a day. Protein group lost a quarter pound a day. Fat Group lost a pound a day, 90 percent fat in their diet and they lost a pound a day up on the same 2000 calories. Keep an think about that. 2,000 colors, not a lot. So if you had 200 calories of carbohydrates and you're going to gain weight from that and you can gain weight from 2000 calories a day. Yeah, that's incredible. So there's other factors and things like that, but there's that just dispels this concept of all count count calories. They're all the same, they're not the same, they're not the same at all. How they impact hormones is not the same hormonal function.

Speaker 3:          01:50:30       Insulin response when our bodies, what does insulin do? Well, it stores it shuttles things, right? So if we are constantly inundating ourselves with carbohydrates and in this store mode, any excess is getting put on, right? How do you tell your body to burn fat, which takes a longer, harder process when you have this easy super rapid thing, it can break down and then use collect. Politically it doesn't make sense, but when they talked to the instagram wizards, these, these, these dieticians in training, they'll tell you, bro, you need fucking carbohydrates to operate your brain, bro. Yeah, all the science. I love this too, and you talk about science and Eddie Bravo would probably like this to Mr. conspiracy theory guy. I love him. Who pays for that fucking carbohydrate research? Gatorade, Gatorade, Sports Science Institute, Gatorade Sports Science Institute has done a majority studies. Nestle skates, gatorade is gatorade that's doing a lot of the studies on carbohydrate performance.

Speaker 3:          01:51:29       They're the guys that also proved, oh, this is the tipping point for fat oxidation and an hour even though they use people that have been in Ketosis for two weeks instead of two years. So when you talk about guys like Jeff and Steve Volvo Cuban doing this research now since the eighties and using athletes that have been keto adapted for awhile, that's when you really begin to see like, Oh shit, okay, this can work. And not just from a physical standpoint. Like I said, the thing that I get mostly from it is the mental. It's the, it's the sharpness. And uh, dominic d'agostino was talking about how you can go on way less sleep, but there's some type of thing that ketones do with the brain where you actually are more rested. Even if you had, if you were sleep deprived. So if you had five or six hours of sleep, you can still wake up feeling refreshed and have your sharpness in the morning rather than being on a heavy carbohydrate intensive diet. Exactly. So they're not sure the mechanism for that yet. That's one. That's why they got these, these geniuses studying these things, but I think that there's nothing more important than when you try something and you actually feel the difference. And that's not me saying like, Oh, you know, if you're Vegan, whatever. If you're Vegan and you feel awesome, fucking awesome, dude. I'm not going to tell you to change. I'm going to say, well, you should've had this dude. No, dude, you've, you've dialed it in. Everyone's different, but this for me has worked

Speaker 1:          01:52:46       wonders. Well, there's also awesome and then there's better than awesome. You know, like some, some people say like, Hey, I've been on this diet and I feel fantastic, so I'm just going to keep it the way it is. But meanwhile, if you added a certain thing to your diet or added a little bit more vitamin D or adding a little bit more, you might feel actually better. Yeah. I like your idea of what awesome is. I think a lot of times it's like if you ever have water in your ear and you think everything's okay, like Ah, this is how I hear, and then you know, like pop, it pops and you go, oh, I could hear like this. Like you weren't even considering that you, you were hearing like shit. That's what cracks me up about when people taught and by no means of my, some type of psychedelic pusher or anything like that.

Speaker 1:          01:53:25       But you know, when I first did Iowaska I was, it consumed my mind, Holy Shit, I want to stand on a mountain top and tell people about this. I want every one of my friends to know about it. My family, I want them to try this. I want them to see what I've seen. Like I don't want them to experience this. And then over time you realize like, Oh, you've listened to people tie like, no, I really don't want like, life's just so good right now. I don't really need to change anything. Like, are you a fucking finished product? You can't improve your life. You, Mr. Perfect. I'm Mr Manhattan. I'm Dr Manhattan, like there's no room for getting better. There's no room for, for enjoying life more improving really, whatever, you know. And that was just funny to me. Uh, that dynamic, you know, there are a lot of people that just say to themselves like, I'm comfortable. Why Change? Yeah, well people don't like feeling like shit and they don't like feeling like their houses in disarray. And so if they get to a state where they go, I, I'm, I'm happy right now. Everything's good. I'm happy right now. Like, uh, I'm happy being chubby. Like I've heard that before. There's nothing wrong with being chubby. I'm happy. I'm happy right now with the way I am.

Speaker 1:          01:54:33       You know, some people will convince themselves all they mean. I oftentimes read things that people write and I go, God damn it. I wonder if this person is expressing themselves honestly or if they're trying to get other people to be convinced that they're okay. You know how I would lean towards that. Yeah. How happy I brought this article up more than once, but I read this article written by this woman who's 70 years old, struggled with weight her whole life and she was promoting fat acceptance and that people are prejudice towards people that are overweight, but in fact she's incredibly healthy and she's so active and she does all these things. She's just always, always been heavy and I'm like, hmm, see scientifically that doesn't make any sense. It just doesn't like if you're. If you're eating healthy foods and your body's healthy, you shouldn't be storing that much extra fat. Just doesn't make any sense. But she's promoting it in this article, like if you didn't know any better and just took this article is like, well, this is this one woman's account of her life. And by her accounts she's incredibly healthy. She's hiking and she's so active and she's eating healthy, but she's just fat.

Speaker 1:          01:55:39       Not, not really make sense? It doesn't know something's missing there. What

Speaker 3:          01:55:44       is it? Well, I mean, I actually had this as one of my first first breakthroughs and my very first ceremony I was uh, I was hearing people violently puke around me and I thought I was like in a war zone and this is just starting to kick in and see me. I've taken the Second Cup Iowasca and it sounds like people are dying. And I realized, oh, they're puking. And then I thought, oh, that's because these fuckers didn't do the data. They didn't eat clean. Like you have to eat a certain way prior to it not, oh, I eat clean, I take care of myself. These people don't take care of themselves. And like all that kind of snowballed into this feeling that I had about fat people in general. Like they didn't. You're not taking care of yourself. What are you doing? Why would you do that to yourself?

Speaker 3:          01:56:32       What would you do to your body? You know, like I've always been thin and athletic and it was easy for me to do these things. So when I'm, when I'm feeling this and I just started to notice like, Holy Shit, what do I feel this way, why would damn this is getting worse and worse, and then I jumped up and grabbed the bucket and puked my brains out like I'd never puked before and it came out of me, this feeling, this animosity towards people and I understood right then like they don't know any better. I don't know how they got there, but I do know that they don't know any better. I don't know how to get out of that. Then even if they do know intellectually, they haven't internalized it. They haven't adjusted. Right. There's plenty of things that you can take at face value.

Speaker 3:          01:57:18       You here resonates with you and you're like, oh yeah, that makes perfect sense. Right. But you don't assimilate it. Put it into action. And I think for them, I don't know, maybe every time their mom and dad fought, they took them to get ice cream cones and McDonald's. Oh that's okay. You know, come on, we'll go for a car ride. It'll be fine. Here's an ice cream cone. And then now anytime that under stress fucking eat ice cream and they don't even think about it or maybe they do know and they still say, I don't care, I know those ice cream I was going to make me feel better, or whatever it is. I don't know. That's not my place to be like, hey you fat, fuck you. You know, like that helped me grow from that. And that was a huge. That was like, oh, how could puking be good?

Speaker 3:          01:57:55       And that puking is amazing when you're getting rid of something like that. Right? Like you're letting go of a thought that you had like this attachment that you had. Yeah. There's, I mean there's a certain holier than thou attitude that certain people with great metabolisms and active lifestyles will have towards people that maybe they just, when they grew up, they weren't led towards athletics. They maybe they were bullied. Maybe they, you know, they had poor diets in the home and they didn't know any better. And now here they find themselves x amount of years later a product to a whole series of things. I think of the impact it would have always get picked last for kickball or something, handball or any of that stupid dumb playground games. You're always picked last. You don't want to play them anymore. You're not interested in that. Yeah. It's an associate them

Speaker 1:          01:58:42       with bad feelings. I was having a conversation about this with a friend of mine. She was talking about like how there's like women that are like angry feminists that get that truly don't like men. They hate men and they don't like masculinity. She was trying to figure out what that's all about and I was like, well, the parallels got to be. There's certain men that I know that don't like women. They hate women and one of the reasons why is because they've been rejected by women their whole lives. So they associate women with a negative feeling. They associate women with rejection. They associate women with the women, like as cold hearted leaves them. It goes with another guy. Negotiation do that to me, that bitch. Well, it's. She doesn't owe you. She's not attracted to you like you've got. For whatever reason the universe dealt you and extremely shitty deck of cards and that's just the way it is, but so forever this person that I know that that has this issue, his association with women is of women.

Speaker 1:          01:59:42       The use him, they want things from him. His money, they don't want him and they treat him badly and he feels like shit and hateful. Whereas I have friends that are good looking guys that for no, there's no reason. They were just born good looking. They just got great bone structure and you know, they happen to look good and women are attracted to them and their ideas of women are totally different. Their ideas of women are. The chicks are fun. The grade don't get tied down though, Bro. You know, keep, keep it moving. You know, like their ideas of women are much more light and like women are there. They're a gift. There are a great thing in life. They're not this evil to. So there's like this association can often be correlated by what kind of a relationship do you have with the opposite sex.

Speaker 1:          02:00:32       Like if you're a woman and you're overweight and you're, you know, you've always been fat, your whole life has been like a series of drunken moments with men who felt sick after they were with you and you were rejected and any man that you were attracted to at wanted to have nothing to do with you. So your feelings about men are just as the angriest assholes. These Bros, these douchebags not taking into consideration like, well, what? What is this relationship you have with them and what's the root cause of it? Some of it is outside of your. If it's just genetics completely outside of your control, there's nothing you can do about the way your face looks or how tall you are, how short you are, how, how big your feet are. You know, there's nothing you can do about that, but the relationship between how, what you look and how physically attractive you are sexually, like people's desire to reproduce with you.

Speaker 1:          02:01:26       It really comes down to that in a lot of ways. Like what is the relationship you have with the opposite sex? Because boy, when you, when you go in and really pay attention to like hardcore, what you find is a lot of older successful women and women that are overweight and not attractive and you find, you know, all sorts of different people in between there, but there's an overwhelming number of people that have not had good success with the opposite sex, both from women hating men and for men hating women and it's like this is an extremely unfortunate, you know, if you look at it that way, it's extremely unfortunate. Like taking out gender inequality, financial issues, all sorts of issues that also come with being a male men's rights advocate or a woman's rights advocate, a feminist. There's a, there's an, an overall attitude that people have an issue with when it comes to someone who identifies with one gender or another gender and despise the other gender.

Speaker 1:          02:02:29       Oftentimes it's because their associations and relationships with that gender have been negative due to the fact that they're not desired. That it's really. It comes down to them. And so what are, what are you doing for yourself? What is your relationship with that part? With the opposite, sex certainly has to do with that, but what is your relationship in life? Do you have this assumption that all dudes are dicks and they all behave the same way and in that it's kind of your mindset can keep you stuck in that whole just the same. If you're always thinking like, this is exactly how they are, this is it. This is exactly what it's going to reciprocate itself over and over and over again. So you're always correct. Yeah, there's that, but then there's also the reality, like my friend who doesn't live was not my friend anymore, but who doesn't like women?

Speaker 1:          02:03:15       He's an ugly dude, so he's gonna be an ugly dude. He'd see like porn. Does he like, does he like. No, it's not like he doesn't like, he gets angry, he gets angry. He's like, it never has a girlfriend. He's never been married. He's just like always like that. It sounds to me like a guy who used to work on himself. Oh, he definitely does, but it's also like the girls that he likes, they'd never really were into. I'm just just not attractive. It's got to shit roll the dice is roll the dice sucks. Don't know where I'm going with this. Well, but uh, what I'm trying to say is I'm not trying to say anything, but if I was trying to say anything I would try to say like there's, there's a lot of complex issues that are going on with how people feel about themselves and how they feel about other people.

Speaker 1:          02:04:04       And oftentimes what they blame other people for is really some shit that's going on with them. Like they find enemies out there external enemies to distract themselves from their internal problems and failures and shortcomings big time. Like you find that a lot with haters. I'm sure you found that when you've read like horrible shit that people write about you online like after fights. Like dude, I mean look, the kind of hate that is available to fighters is some of the most fucking vicious and personal and emotional. The people that go after them, like quote unquote fans. Yeah. Every one of them is a loser. Every one of them, every one of them. Every fucking evil nasty Douche bag that seeks you out to say mean shit to you after a loss and tweets at you. You know, and so, I mean I've seen some horrific shit that guy's right.

Speaker 1:          02:04:59       Two fighters directly after a loss both on facebook and on instagram, twitter, everything. Those people are all unsuccessful. They're all failures. All of them. That's the only reason why they would do that. It's one thing to say, man, you know that fucking guy, he got killed or man, you know, that guy got tapped quick or how good is this guy? Man, I can't believe he ran through that guy like this. Those are like almost a analytical discussions that you have with people where things happen and you didn't see a comment like, okay, Ryan Bader versus rumble Johnson like that fight without saying anything horrible about Ryan Bader. You'd go, fuck man, rumble Johnson. Jesus crushed you. Just random over man. Fuck who can take that guy shots and you, that's a got a non asshole way of approaching it. But good Lord, I read some Shit online that people tweeted to him to bader and like, you fucking, you should be in a jail somewhere.

Speaker 1:          02:05:53       You're a monster. Like you're, you're looking at this guy like here's a downed wounded thing and I'm going to just piss on him. I'm going to find a spot, a soft spot, and I'm a jab him with sticks. I'm going to see if I could fuck with his head. You know, and anybody who does that, those people that are doing that, those haters, they're all losers. It's the saddest thing about it. It's like they're looking at this one person, this one thing, this, this object that they can attack and they're externalizing all the issues they have with themselves, the imbalances they have, and then this new ability that we have to reach people and communicate with people that really don't want to have anything to do with you. You know, in the real world. Ryan Bader doesn't give a fuck about this guy's opinion. He doesn't know I'm in the real world.

Speaker 1:          02:06:37       Nobody's saying shit to his face. Like, oh my God, I think that's Ryan Bader. They run up to him and just blow him right there. So cool. You're so fucking awesome. You know? Serious. Same exact guy. Same exact guy. Boy. Some hateful people out there, man. I know so many fighters just don't go on social media now because of it. You know, you would think photos are tough. They should feel. Could toughen up. Like maybe you're just a con. Maybe it's not. Fighters are tough and they should just toughen up. Maybe it's like what you're doing, you're, you're being shitty to someone you don't even know.

Speaker 1:          02:07:10       Again, where am I going with this? I don't know. I completely agree. I've even when I, when we forget who it was, green flower media did a thing on me talking about cannabis and cbd and how many guys in the sport use and just, you know, not naming names and Jose conseco showing it, but talking about a lot of smoke pot, like it helps us sleep at night helps turn off our brain when we're overthinking shit and you got something big coming up. I'm more than obviously now with Usada and things like that. There's a lot less, but back in the day. Yeah, fucking, there was a lot of us out of competition. You, you, you can smoke pot and in competition like you can smoke pot up until like the week of the fight. And this is good news for me to tell to tell people.

Speaker 1:          02:07:53       Yeah. But yeah, we did that video and then sure enough, I didn't know it was going to get decent. Not that it went big, but Bj Penn Dot com ran it and it made it bigger than it was. And of course, and the bottom of the video, everyone's comments. I got like two or three guys. I was like, oh no, this is a site. Oh No. It didn't help him. Uh, with Jimmy men will pay a, smashed his face and did it. He wasn't smoked that, you know, it's like, Oh God, like how does this have anything to do with, with what we're talking about here has nothing to do with anything. But it's funny. It's like, Oh, let me allow me to, uh, allow me to knock it down here. A couple, a couple of pegs. Well, while we're talking, you know, well there's also people that don't recognize what they're doing and they just, they're just talking, you know, just making noises and they're not even, they're not evil, they just don't realize what they're saying is hurtful or stupid or idiotic because they've been given this access to people that's unprecedented.

Speaker 1:          02:08:51       There's no training for this. Like no one, no one had anything like social media and our parents' days. It just didn't exist. So they never taught us about it. That's one thing, thinking about having kids, like I look at bear now and I'm like, fuck dude, we, we grew up when you had wired telephones and then we saw a giant, Zach Morris cell phones come into play and we had the car phone and like things like that, you know, and then just this evolution over time, like they're born, they're not knowing a world without internet, without instant access. Grandparents, same thing. They were like, Bar, remember when you, how to take a boat to get here from Europe. And then, you know, we grew up in a much more technically technologically advanced era, but our kids are going to grow up in an era that's mind blowing to us, but their kids are gonna grow up in an era of virtual reality that makes this look like a joke.

Speaker 1:          02:09:42       It makes our video games like stupid, you know? Yeah. My Dad's always brag about how awesome mafia three was. Listen, you know, I had to sit in front of a box like I'm in the fucking Star Trek Room, right? Surrounded by killers right now. Yeah. We're probably going to go to places just like those old swartz and egg or movies or any of those movies. You're going to probably go to a place. You're going to lie down, they're going to clamp some shit down on the side of your head and you go, are you ready, Mr Kingsberry give me the thumbs up. If you're ready to launch and you give the thumbs up. And usually you're in the avatar world and you're riding a fucking dragon. You know what I mean? That's Gunna happen inside of the next hundred years. It's a 100 percent going to happen. It's just a matter of time.

Speaker 1:          02:10:22       If they keep going, we don't blow ourselves up. We don't get hit by an asteroid. They're going to come up with artificial reality that is indistinguishable from this reality and all of our entertainment is going to be a joke. Like, why would you actually jump out of a plane and go skydiving when you can get the skydiving experience with this thing on your head. It's gonna make you feel like you did. That was that movie a total recall? Strange days. Oh yeah, that's right. Right. You could fit into it and they had like snuff videos where a guy would actually kill somebody and you felt what he felt when he killed another person, like you felt all the neurotransmitters. Everything was going through your brain to the heart racing feeling of actually ending someone's life and you know, that was the illegal portion of it. Then they had the legal portion would be like sex with your loved one or whatever.

Speaker 1:          02:11:09       Those kinds of things, but you could actually tap into the consciousness of someone's memory as long as that was recorded. I think that's going to happen. I think it's definitely gonna happen. Uh, it's just a matter of time if they keep going, it's a matter of one invention and one discovery makes way for another intervention and another discovery that compound on each other. They build on each other. And next thing you know, reality is unrecognizable. Like the reality that we experience today. No, we're talking about these primitive diets, primal existence and you know, how our bodies, the idea behind all of this is obviously that our bodies, it takes thousands of years. They say about 10,000 years for your genes to totally change and adapt to new diet, new environment, new lifestyle. And so we're dealing with bodies that are primarily adjusted to a hunter gatherer lifestyle and all this other stuff that we've added into it over the last 10, 20,000 years or whatever, agriculture, grains, growing different foods that you could keep them in storage bins and things like that, like grain silos.

Speaker 1:          02:12:15       That's all fairly reason. It's and you know, yes, you can live like that for sure. Yeah. Grains or. Yeah, he can eat it, but what is your body like optimized for? What is, what is your body exists with the least amount of hiccups? Well, it's probably the stuff that's like super, like clean and normal like fish, vegetables, chicken, meat, things along those lines. The stuff that we haven't fucked with farm raised this and that. No, no, no. Farm raised fish. Eating genetically modified soybeans and whatever, you know, just what's the most realist food we can put on our body. Well, you, you, you probably go camping and shit too, right? Do you? Yeah. Yeah. You know that feeling you get when you're out in the woods when you don't, you don't have any cell phone signal with any ala mushrooms that too. Well that's, that's extreme.

Speaker 1:          02:13:05       But just even being alone, like you hear the nothing, you have nothing. You hear the real nothing. The real nothing of the woods. It's almost like scary because you realize like, this forest doesn't give a fuck about me. If a tree falls in your head and you die right there, the forest doesn't skip a beat. The squirrels and chipmunks keep running around. The birds. Keep flying. The deer keep running. It's the same. It literally does not matter does it? It's been like this before you. It will be like this. Unless we fuck it up. It'll be like this after you. This is just the way. If we fuck it up, it'll go back to that at some point or something different and it'll become something different. Some some new form of nature, but you go from that to like cities and cities have this bizarre, strange, different kind of life.

Speaker 1:          02:13:53       Like I was in Manhattan last weekend. It's fucking awesome. It's awesome to visit. He'd go there. You're like, you're going from one place to another in this restaurant that building and look at this view and Holy Shit and get on a subway and you're cruising along under the buildings and it's awesome, but it's awesome in a completely different way. It's awesome. In this new way, this new bizarre way that we're sort of adapting to, you know, and this new way is available to us and wasn't available to people 10,000 years ago. This was a mindblower if you took someone from 10,000 years ago and brought on a Manhattan and just put them in like the 72nd floor of one of those apartment buildings with the crazy view. Just look out, look out at the city. Be like, what in the fuck am I seeing? You know, like you've been to vegas. You ever been like the top of, uh, the Mandalay bay, that bar that's up there that has the crazy view and the glass floor. Oh yeah. Fuck. He just look out at the top of that building. You're like, God, this is insane. This is like some,

Speaker 3:          02:14:56       oh shit. Yeah. We're experiencing something that no, no cultures ever experienced. We're experiencing something that no generation has ever experienced this. The technological heights that we're living in and this ain't shit compared to what our kids are going to experience. Well, the, hopefully there are intelligent people like Marxists on another, guys that continue to push the envelope to reconnect. You know, like there is a reason that we feel amazing at the beach. Not everyone has access to the beach, but there's a reason we feel amazing at the beach and scientifically they're showing now with negative ions and the energy, the energy of the earth like it. It has an impact on how we feel the beach does. The ocean does for sure. The wind coming off the ocean does. So even if you were on a boat out over the water, you're going to feel better just from doing that.

Speaker 3:          02:15:46       What does it do? Like what specifically does it do to you? From what I read and I understand there are an abundance of negative ions, so from an electrical standpoint, you're talking again about the human energy field and auras and shallcross bro. Chakra here. Just going to feel more alive like every, every part of you. I can't describe like from a feeling standpoint, everyone has their experience at the ocean, but from an electrical standpoint you would say like you are, you're clearing out blockages from your ci, from a Chinese medicine standpoint, from a Kundalini and yoga standpoint, you're going to clear out blockages the same way and you're just are those blockages are the is this is a really a blockage or you just experiencing from the ocean and it feels good. Maybe both. Maybe there is no blockage, but I'm willing to bet from somebody who sits too long or has stressed, you know, and different things like that.

Speaker 3:          02:16:40       Like they're very much can be a physical attachment to emotion and if you've ever had like bodywork done or somebody you have a, you know, somebody is working to and not and you all of a sudden start thinking of this thing that's been bothering you in your head, a relationship, whatever. That there is physical attachments to mental and emotional things that go on in your, in your head. So. So when you get a massage and like the of like a knot and they work through it, you think there's emotions tied up in that? Not. Not always, but sometimes. Really? Yeah, sure. How's that work? I don't know how it works. I don't know why. I don't know why it would manifest there. I don't know why we have an electrical field that we do. I don't believe that there's emotions tied up in knots in your body.

Speaker 3:          02:17:26       I think when you get rid of those knots, it relaxes you and that helps you deal with emotions better. Okay. Maybe we went down the wrong path there. Does that make sense? Say Yes. I agree with that. From a feel good standpoint, feeling better at the ocean might just be the view. But from an electrical standpoint, there are. And this one goes back to the studies done at Ucla, there very much is an electrical standpoint that that changes from the ionic energy coming from the waves coming from the water coming from the wind that's above the water, right? Because like yoga talk, they'll say shit to you. Like this hip opener is gonna. Make you feel, feel better about your childhood. It's gonna. Open up emotional blockages and you're like, I'm pretty sure we're just stretching. Yeah, well that's just talking about root Chakra and exactly how the different Chakras work, what they correlate to and things like that.

Speaker 3:          02:18:12       I don't know necessarily in a visionary state. I can see energy. I don't see colors. I don't see like, Oh, here's my heart Chakra or something like that. But I have seen trees communicate to one another, like vibrations coming from the treetops as they were talking to one another. What is it like? What does it look like? I'm like, ripples and water, but it's the air that's rippling and you could see like perfect circles coming from the tops of the tree tops. There was something I tweeted the other day. They, they found that Venus fly traps do calculations. They count like for some study they figured out some, uh, some method of measuring the fact that they actually count things there. They're doing calculations like that. They're not smart. They're, there is an intelligence plants. That's just, that's what I left at. The argument from vegans on, from from a consciousness standpoint, whatever spark we have, call it soul, call it whatever plants have it, whatever.

Speaker 3:          02:19:16       Whatever animates us and gives us us. It's in them too. Yeah, for sure. For sure. Is this. It's. They don't. They can't communicate in a that we can clearly understand. They don't bark at us, they don't look at us with sad puppy dog eyes, but there's something alive in them. Some strange way that they communicate and that they absorb energy and life and that you get that from them. Let me. Life eats life. But that said, I know many people that have had a visionary experiences and became Vegan afterwards. Yeah, that's actually, that's actually really common, especially in people that do multiple Iowaska ceremonies and I had a vision. My only vision I've ever had a bears. I had a vision of seeing a panda bear eats bamboo and then I saw a black bear eating berries and I was like, Oh fuck, am I going to be Vegan?

Speaker 3:          02:20:07       And then I saw grizzly snatch and salmon out and I was like, oh. And it was just the eat the natural, whatever it is. There's no right or wrong, but eat, take from take from me. This is mother earth talking to me. Take from me. Yeah. So that's what it was. It wasn't. This is right. That's wrong. Every animal needs different things. You know, there's always these front of Erin Simpson for I think he posted a giant gorilla and he's like, no, no enough protein in my diet, bro. This 800 pound gorilla, you know. And it's like, hey look, there's no, there's no right or wrong here. Like you're not going to go to the, to the line and say, Oh, you're doing this all wrong. Lion here. Eat some grass instead. Like, come on. No, it's fine. As long as it's from nature, besides take it is a totally different animal.

Speaker 3:          02:20:54       It's not a person like, you know, they have a chemical standpoint, they're going to break down things. We can't break down with that. They just depends on added to our debt so that people love that argument. Look, strong grills are bro Roots Shit. Why don't you go pull shit out of a swamp? And eat the stem, like the chew on stems. What else do they do? They also have one inch dicks about that. A lot of bad things about being a gorilla. I Dunno, I just think that um, factory farming is something that people recognize a lot when they have psychedelic experiences. The connection between the suffering of their food. And that's real. I've had multiple versions of that for sure. That's as real as it gets. Multiple. And that's not fun. It's not like you watched that and you're like, oh, like you're watching a movie.

Speaker 3:          02:21:42       It's not like watching the cove and then Washington, the cove is hard enough. But when you experience it, you feel what it's like. You embody that consciousness. Yeah. And you know, they know they're all fucking aware. They're not just these dumb things like we're going to need some whatever they provide for me. Oh you know, like my buddies on the chopping block, like I'm stuck here shoulder to shoulder. Like you feel you can feel that and tap into that. And I don't know how that's going to stop that. That seems to be ingrained in our idea of feeding cities. It seems like the only way they can produce enough meat to feed all these fucking people in these cities, the way they're doing it now is to continue this factory farming method. It's just terrific. In the movie food inc. Awesome documentary and the end is hey, like, yeah, it's fucked.

Speaker 3:          02:22:34       WhAt do we do? What do we do now? You do vote with your dollar, so every time you say, I can't even taste the difference between free range eggs and these caged eggs, I'm going to save a few bucks. You vote with your dollar. Like if you spend a little extra, you're going to feel better from it, but also you're going to help change the culture and they show walmart show having a organic, a yogurt or something on the shelves. Just because there's demand there. I mean if you go into costco, here in California, they have all kinds of organic shit and costco and mass produced widescale for cheap because there's a demand for it. you go there and Arizona and Nevada maybe not the same, you know, like whole foods is going to have whole foods, but from, from giant companies like that they're listening and it's just a matter of money that people are willing to spend it and this is what they want.

Speaker 3:          02:23:23       They're going to supply it, period. Yeah. But there's also those ag ag gag laws that keep people from filming factory farms where they, you know, they pack these chickens and these horrible living conditions and you can't film it if you film it, you can get in deep trouble. Like they did a drone video, uh, a pig farm and the pig farm and carolina, that Was a motherfucker nasty. And they show that they were, they had next to and they interview the people that are living by their and they just smell it constantly. Oh yes. Funk, death. Just death and methane. I mean the, the, that river of piss and shit that comes out of the bottom of that place and settles into that little lake that they had. And that's not normal piston shit that is the worst, most diseased piss and shit. That's I imagine just living there, working there rather like someone who works in there, like that's the sadness you feel every day in the smells that you take in through your nose.

Speaker 3:          02:24:20       Every day. Peta was shown a video probably one of the worst that I actually had the balls to watch of a how folk was made in France. You seeing this just brutal like they have people are working there and they're tossing in the chicks. That's their job to them in the meat grinder of humans that actually have to be a part of that process. So the ones that they don't, they don't want to like was it males or something like that. They get rid of to the female one or the other, but it's. Yeah, the folk want. We know what's interesting about fog wise, they actually gravitate towards that feeder. It's really strange. I had a farmer explained it to me before, like they actually want to be fed like that. Go to that feeder and you can grab them and stick it in their mouth and we.

Speaker 3:          02:25:02       It looks awful when they force feed them bum up. Yeah, they forced feeding with and just pour it down their throat, but apparently it's not that bad for them. It's just perception is as far as like were fattening them up for slaughter and what if that was you and they put your mouth around this metal pipe and it's quality of life, you know, but seeing these guys go through the meat grinder and some of them don't die. The grinding up of the chicks, they get ground up and some come out the other side still alive. She fog though. They do that with a lot of roosters. That's just a fact. They just grind them up. Yeah, it's a fuck deal. It's a deal. You know, I was on the highway once I pass this truck and it was stuffed with chickens. It was just madness.

Speaker 3:          02:25:43       I was looking at this truck, it was like, you know, there were some openings where the chickens could breathe like some small holes in the side of the truck and you just realizing this is like a, a thing that's packed with life as being treated like a commodity, like stacked rocks. You know? It's bizarre. It's bizarre to see a truck just driving doWn the road. It's just stacked bottom to top with living things that are just going to get either ground up or chopped up or you know, doesn't matter. Going off to death. Well it's what happened when we made these city things. This is also something that didn't exist 10, 20,000 years ago when they had any kind of agriculture back then. You grew some livestock, he killed those animals. You knew where they lived, he knew what they ate or you knew the guy who raised them and it was real simple.

Speaker 3:          02:26:35       And then somewhere along the line someone said, we need like a costco of farming. We need to get a big place and stuff. Everything in there and close it to the general public so nobody could see and jab these fuckers with needles and fill them up with antibiotics so they don't get sick for all this crazy food we're giving them. And boy, that changed from that. People are much more aware now and they're asking for free range food and antibiotic free food and you know, grass fed meats and things along those lines, but most people can't afford it. A lot of people can't afford it is a difference between, I think I spent a shit ton of money on that. I really do it. A lot of money goes there. I think knowing where to get your food from, like there's certain things you got to go like, okay, hey, I can't afford that.

Speaker 3:          02:27:22       To this day. I don't buy grass fed filet mignon, it's $25 a pound, but I can afford grass fed burger, right? And free range chicken. TheY sell free range chicken free range, organic chicken at costco now, so I can get it for three 99 a pound. What does that mean though? When they say free range organic or they lie down a field they're allowed to go around. Now there's varying levels of that obviously. Um, and it's certainly on a mass scale, you're probably not going to be the same as farmer john down the street who's doing it all natural. Organic is still going to be organic feed, you know, they can't do any antibiotics and they can't feed them gmo food. From what my understanding is. Well what's interesting to me is that we're having these conversations now very frequently. There's a lot of these documentaries where it's food inc or king corn or cowspiracy. There's a bunch of these documentaries where people are examining how food is made and prepared and where it's coming from and how they're growing it and, and we're more aware of it now than ever before. so some people, at least some people, there's a movement to more conscious choices

Speaker 1:          02:28:22       and this wasn't around when our parents were around, but I don't think factory farming was around when they were around either. Was also the difference in the amount of people. I mean I've read something about the 19 seventies if there was like a hundred million plus less people in America in the 19 seventies. I mean that's inside my life. A $100, million plus more people just here in the United States. Go research that. Jamie, pull that up is a wizard with this shit. Nineteen 77. He was around $203 million. Yeah, so It's $100. Million difference. That's crazy. Boy, we've lucked the fuck. We just love making babies. Baby boomers. All the baby boomers, kids have kids and you're a part of the problem now to allow me to. Yeah, the good news is the good. The good news is we were like, oh, you know, three, four. Who knows?

Speaker 1:          02:29:16       Right. Then if you do that first six months and you're like, he might be an only child, what the fuck did we do? What do we get ourselves into? We were talking about this before the podcast. Once they start talking about it's a totally different world, it gets it, it all gets way better. It gets way more easy, but when they start talking, they become like your little friends, you know, like it's, it becomes like, I can't wait to see my kids. Like after this podcast, I'm gonna go hang out with them. And it becomes amazing. It is amazing. And they hug you and they talked to you about school. And my daughter had this thing today at school. She had this little, um, you know, like, what do they call them? I want to say a recital assembly. Thank you very much. Jamie. They had a little assembly and all the kids do their little thing and she had this big thing that she was really proud of because she had announced something and say a part of this little thing that they were going to do part of the song.

Speaker 1:          02:30:06       They're doing a song about a different languages and speaking french speaking spanish and so she, she has to go up and do this little thing. It's just like this little proud moment and afterwards she's like beaming and she's so happy. She's five and she runs up to me and jumps in my arms and gives me this big hug. The love that you get from that, the feeling that you get of, of warmth and of love and connection with this little tiny, beautiful human boy is like nothing else like it. And then you also recognize, and this was one of the big ones for me as I, as my chIldren got older and I started putting it all started of trying at least to put the pieces of it all together. I started looking at people like they're babies. Like, oh, this fucked up dude who's angry at the world and just devastated.

Speaker 1:          02:30:51       And just emotionally a wreck. That was a baby. That was a baby that just didn't get the love that he needed or a baby that was abused or a baby that was neglected or a baby that was rejected, like whatever. It was a fucked up person. Now in my mind became a baby like crazy people. Like I'd see a girl, you know, on top of a bar with a fucking chop off, ooh, that's a baby. That's a baby that became that. Any asshole guy, you know, it was fucking screaming at people at traffic and pointing up, you'll fuck full. You're fucking hills. That's a baby. That's a baby that became this asshole. Like it's, it's just this developmental process that goes off the rails and into the forest. And it's fucked up. And to get it back on track is insanely difficult, insanely. And the work that's required, most people are not willing to do dmt.

Speaker 1:          02:31:50       Most people are not willing to, you know, to change their diet and to take yoga every morning and to fucking get up early and meditate for 20 minutes every day to try to be mindful. Most people are just acting on momentum. Just scrambling. And how can I distract myself? What can I put in front of my face that will make me think of something else than what I have to deal with. That's whY I like talking to people like you because I know that you're this on this constant search for improvement and this constant search for growth. And I think that talking to people like you and talking to people that are filling themselves with knowledge and, and constantly trying to evaluate their perspective and maybe enhance their perspective, that's inspiring. And um, it, it, it, it aLso, it gives fuel to other people that want to do the same.

Speaker 1:          02:32:36       You know, like people will hear this podcast and they'll go, fuck man, I want to try some of that shit that kyle kingsbury tried. Maybe I want to do iowasca. Maybe I want to read some of the books that he read. Maybe I want to try some of the meditation techniques he's tried. Maybe I want to do this, maybe I want to do that. And I think in doing that, like in like one person like you who's seeking these things, you can start like this cascade. You start this, this effect and you started the cascade. I mean it have to fit. I've listened to so many podcasts where I was like, fuck that guy. Alright, let me do that. I mean even just wim hoff just in that weeks I heard him, I don't know, maybe a couple of weeks after he was on, I was doing breathwork at the beach and my buddy was like, man, he looked well. We also had a little, a laser disc will will say, we watched the laser disc watched the laserdisc. How do I put this in?

Speaker 1:          02:33:32       Trying to figure out what to read between the lines here. I'm tribals syllables. Laser ll. There we go. Okay. You're talking about mushrooms and I was like, this is all this shit. We've got to keep under wraps. That's true. Laser disk. I get it. I didn't understand that. That's something I've never done. See? Yeah. Well people keep telling me. Some woman was yelling at me I to show the other night. I think I was listening to you and red band talked about this and mescalin and things like that and pod. And I was like, man, I can't believe with having tried other things that you didn't try that. Yeah, there's a bunch of shit I haven't tried. I heard, um, jim fadiman,

Speaker 3:          02:34:18       who wrote the psychedelic explorer's guide, heard him on ferris's podcast. God his book read it, and then I saw that maps was doing the multidisciplinary association of psychedelic studies was doing a presentation in palo alto down the street from me and rick doblin, the head of maps was going to be there presenting with jim fadiman like, oh, this is amazing. I got to go. And once you've had a breakthrough second delegate experience, it's amazing. It can be life changing or it can fuck you up, whatever you can take that for what it is. A large portion of his book was on microdosing and in microdosing they were talking about taking a sub, sub perceptual breakthrough level. So meaning like, I don't see shit, I just feel and think differently. Right? And he said that's really the future of psychedelic research. And that's exactly what hoffman was doing until he died at 100, two years old.

Speaker 3:          02:35:09       The guy who developed lsd. Um, so we went and I listened to these guys speak. And since then I have tried microdosing with lsd and it is phenomenal. Like it's almost like a smart drug in itself, but you feel good, you have energy, you can see why people might do it at a festival or a concert. Everything sounds a little more clear. Like a music sounds better. If I could, I could see myself running on it like a, you really can, can, you could still interact. I can talk to cops on it. Like you were fine to communicate and to be, but you do think differently. You are connected in a different way. That's all the rage in silicone valley. Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly. And I was talking to you right when I was here and I was like, oh man. Oh man. That down with a mescalin not down with the lsd.

Speaker 3:          02:35:53       Huh? Not that I'm not down. The problem with acid is the people that want to do acid with you. You don't want to do acid with them, you know, like, yeah, I gotta go dude. It's all these weird people that are pushing it and they want it. Like dunkin is the only guy that I know that gets real acid and we've sort of made a loose commitment to me and him getting together and doing it one day. I want to hear about that, that's for sure. Awesome. I'll definitely talk about it. But, um, the, the, the thing that I've been really into that I get these big breakthrough, I'm objective moments. Introspective moments is edible pot and psych and um, um, flotation, flotation chambers. There's something about sensory deprivation with the edible pot. It creates this bizarre sort of, um, hallucinogenic state, visionary state that's very unusual, very unusual from a visionary standpoint.

Speaker 3:          02:36:48       Do you, when you see obviously you're in pitch black, so anything you see in your mind's eyes What you're seeing, would you say you see like more of the sacred geometry or the kaleidoscope of shapes and things that you do from dmt or do you just see like a memory or you relive something or maybe you see something from that's been on your mind and you live that moment for a second and then pull back out of it? well, that's one of the fascinating things about it is the experience is incredibly flexible. Whereas like the experience

Speaker 1:          02:37:16       of dmt, although it varies, it's also very dmt. Like when you do dmt, like,

Speaker 2:          02:37:23       aw,

Speaker 1:          02:37:26       reality dissolves and you're there. Like the last one that I had was very strangely, there was these gestures that were giving me the finger. They kept giving me the finger. I'm like, what is this about? And then I was trying to figure out like what are they trying to tell me? And one of the things that were trying to tell me is, uh, it, it was almost like a reaction to not worrying what other people think of you or not worrying about people fucking with you or not. It was almost like, what do you care? What do you care? I'm doing this to youtube, what do you care? What do you care? Like, why, why are you tripping about this? And then I kind of got it in the trip and then they'll like shaking their head. Yeah. And there's this weird fractal thing that's constantly going on, but every time I do it, it seems like these lessons that are wrapped up in these visions with communicating entities, whatever the fuck they are, where they're figments of your imagination, whether they're real, there's always lessons in there.

Speaker 1:          02:38:24       And these lessons are always pertaining to either a personal hiccup that I got going on or something that I'm struggling with or trying to overcome or something that I'm constantly focusing on and trying to understand better. So it's like, let me help you out there, dude, fuck you. And you're like, these gestures, we're all going, fuck you. It was like, why are they going to fuck you? I was trying to figure out what it is. It's like it's almost a, an, an inoculation to hostility. Like their like letting you like what? Why are you even taking this in? Like you know, what, what, why are you even concentrating on that? This is pointless. There's so much more. And then when you get past that level, the experience in blossoms into some new level of experience. So the dmt state is very dmt like. But the cannabis, the edible cannabis to the 11 hydroxy metabolite state that you get from edible cannabis, which is dose per dose, five times more psychoactive than thc.

Speaker 1:          02:39:21       That's why people when they eat it, they trip out and like, oh my god, so many laced it with something. No, it's very much like an intense psychedelic when you eat it. That's why you got to be careful and not eat too much. Like people that fucking freak out and panic attacks. It's because it's strong as shit when you eat it. But in the tank, sometimes I go on these Journeys that I like, I'm in the forest and I can hear other languages and I understand them and I don't know what the fuck they are and sometimes I'm a part of a like a ball of yarn that the universe is made out of and each individual fiber that's in this gigantic strand that's a part of this wrapped up ball of yarn is all the individual atoms that make up being a person or a tree or a book or a rock and all these different things are intertwined and it shows you the fractal nature of reality from the lowest subatomic particle to the biggest planet in the solar system to the biggest galaxy in the universe.

Speaker 1:          02:40:26       And it just goes out there and this very strange and humbling and bizarre like a volt vulnerable vulnerability inducing state. And then it'll go from that to cartoons. Fucking like would to been like neon cartoons banging each other and producing a bunch of other neon cartoons. Cartoons. Fucking dude. This is not just cartoons fucking, but they're like neon. They're like made out of like neon lights. And they're banging each other and they're, they're becoming other ones that having that god damn thing in my basement is a blessing and a curse at the same time because, uh, it's, it's a blessing and that it's great that I can go in there anytime I want, but sometimes one crazy trip, I'll just leave me like baffled for days, but the relaxation aspect of it too. So sometImes I'll go in there on the couch and just chill out and just float and I get out of there.

Speaker 1:          02:41:21       Man. I feel like I'll be in there and while I'm in there floating, I like push down to my hips and my back would go pop, pop. Like everything's like loosening up because of all the, all the epsom salts in it has magnesium and magnesium is great for your body. It's one of the best ways to absorb magnesium is through the skin. That's why an epsom salt bath is so good for your musCles and there's no epsom salt bath can fuck with the tank. Not even close that thousand pounds of salt. No massage can fuck with the tech. Yeah, go ahead. Amazing massages. But when you come of the tank, you do feel like you're floating four hours after you just feel high. So you've been in the tank, you just haven't been in a tank on anything.

Speaker 3:          02:41:59       I haven't done anything in the tank. Not yet. And that's like a smoke a little. Just a little sister. My brother, my brother have a good now there's plaCes available in the bay area. See, back in the day there was a lady in los gatos so it wasn't far from me and she sponsored me for fight camps, so I would go in once a week or twice a week leading up to a fight. Oh really? Interesting. And it was amazing. It was a great. That really got me into flotation and then she ended up moving down to santa cruz, which is a little hike for me. So I have been an oakland different places. They have them set up now and um, there's a couple places that allow the bin night run, so you can go in at midnight and stay overnight. So you do it overnight, float all the way until 6:00 AM or 8:00 AM.

Speaker 3:          02:42:43       Yeah. Someone's in there with you. Oh, they have someone working there, but you're, you know, you can go in there and ben just sleeping it basically so crazy. Hippy. They think they know what's up. I think they know what time it is. Oh, so it's just a matter of what um, you know, what do I. That's why I was like, I was curious. I wanted to ask you about that. Like what do you, what, when you say visionary state, what are you getting from that? Well, when you say like, sometimes I'm in the woods. There's this, that's all the answer that I need. That's for sure going to happen. I've done mushrooms in them. That's pretty intense to how many grams now? That many. Like three. Okay. See, I found like, I mean that's a lot, but not like. Yeah. Yeah. I feel like between a, a, one gram to four gram dose, I get a lot of feeling from it, but I don't necessarily get to a visionary state of five grams, but do it in silent darkness. Like where do you, where are you doing it?

Speaker 3:          02:43:38       I, yeah, if I guess it would be, it would be different there. The visionary state, to me it occurs with the eyes closed. That's where the real visions Come and most of the time when people are doing it, they're out in nature and they were like the first time I ever did mushrooms we did it like in the woods and his beautiful manage felt he felt like the vibrations of the earth as if it was like loving you and breathing and like, like it was you felt like connected to it in a way that I'd never felt before, but there was no, not much visions because you're out there. I mean it seemed like alive and everything seemed strange, kind of pixelated and everything sort of had like a, like a geometric pattern to it in a weird way that you never experienced. Tasha and I did have had him at the beach and we had a monster dose one time after iowasca is really kind of improved other psychedelic experiences for both of us because we can let go.

Speaker 3:          02:44:31       Yeah. Like some of those lessons of not trying to control it, you know, just going with the flow and, and um, and then also from a stomach standpoint, like a lot of people that eat mushrooms, it fucks her stomach up. It used to fuck my stomach up, but after you've purchased from iowasca, like it's nothing for me to have a bunch of mushrooms and my stomach's never did that to me, to my stomach. I don't know why this is really is. It's, I think it's very personal deal. But uh, we had seven grams each on the beach and that's the most we've ever taken. And I went when I was face up, she's 110 pounds too. So she's the real trooper. But when I was face up you could see things that I wouldn't normally see like, like, uh, seagulls in a v formation I could see like laser beams connecting their wings.

Speaker 3:          02:45:14       And then it was like fractal, like you would from a dmt trip. but every color of the light spectrum was connecting their wings as they flowed through air. And then the sound of the ocean is different. But then when I went face down and bears buried my face in the sand, then I had complete visionary state just like dmt or or iowasca even. Yeah, I would imagine. And probably last a long ass time to long time. That was a long day at the beach. It's probably a couple solid hours of visions then, right? With that kind of dose. Yeah. On and off. There were some. Yeah, there. I kept seeing that initially I kept seeing like this, like a group of people like kind of eyeball on us that I was thinking like, are they going to take our shit? Like are they going to try to steal or am I going to have to fight someone?

Speaker 3:          02:46:01       Like this is weird. This is a place not a lot of people go to. And I kept seeing that and then I had to take a deep breath and tosca You like feel me, you know, feel like my energy. She could feel what's going on. She's like, are you okay? Like somebody kind of come know whAt do you, what are you talking about? She's like playing fucking sea turtle bugs. Shit. Whatever, you know, like she just doesn't have it, you know, and she's looking over at me and am I okay? And she's like, seriously, you're fine, don't worry, you're fine. I was like, okay. And I put my head back down and it kept seeing. Didn't like this young kid kind of comes through the crowd, like he's going to challenge me and he walks down like, oh fuck, I got a defender. So I got to fight and I know how fucked up I am.

Speaker 3:          02:46:41       Like I can't believe we had to defend myself. And I'm like, it's playing out in my mind all the ways that I'm going to have to fight this guy. And I realized right then like I stand up open. I was like, oh fuck, it's just a vision. And I was like, my heart's raciNg. And I'm like, why would I think that? And then I realized every fucking day of my life since I was a little kid, I played that out. Anytime someone gives me a dirty look or it says like we're from whatever being picked on as a kid, bullied that kind of shit. Like I always play that out, like how am I going to have to fight this guy? Am I going to have to fucking defend myself? How's it going to play out? Oh he's, he's got a long fucking neck, I'm going to take us back and choke them out, whatever, you know, what I'm saying?

Speaker 3:          02:47:20       But, but it just showed me how silly this dumb ass mind game that I would play and I would go down the rabbit hole on a fucking daily basis sometimes. Like, like just playing into this thought of negativity that had no space for me and it does me no good to play that out. Like, that's fine because then I'll do this. No, no, no, none of that shit. I'm wasting time and becoming emotionally attached to those thoughts. It's not just, oh, I'm thinking about this. I'm feeling like I'm going to fight right now. That fucks you up. That turns you into not your best version of yourself. So that vision from mushrooms was just a fucking game changer. It doesn't stop me from having those thoughts, but it allows me to catch myself. I'm aware of it. You know the pattern still exists, you just don't entertain it.

Speaker 3:          02:48:05       I don't entertain it. I can see it and let it go. Like when they talk about meditating, oh, if you have a thought, just recognize the thought and let it go. That's easier said than done. Now I've had time to digest and assimilate that and especially bouncing or bartender and the guy's being a dick or whatever. It's very easy, much easier for me to be like, I don't have to entertain. The guy swings at me. Then it happens. That's worried about you're not going to not know when it's getting there, but there's no need sometimes. The things. I always say that about cops, like sometimes I bet certain people, whether it's the people that deal with the cops or certain people that are cops, things happen that don't need to happen because people have these ideas or have these patterns that are playing on in their head and for a comp I would imagine it's got to be incredibly difficult because you're dealing with all these people that are constantly breaking laws and violating things and you're supposed to enforce them and you're constantly worried about getting shot and getting home to your family. You're constantly worried about pulling some guy over and he's got fucking 20 pounds of coke in the back of the machine gun in his front seat and you don't know because there's windows are tinted elixir. Roll down your window

Speaker 1:          02:49:08       and you get your hand on your gun. You're like, what the fuck am I getting into here? And then these patterns that people have, whether it's as a police officer, as a person getting pulled over by cops, they can change the way you interact with people and change the circumstances of the day and and turned a tragedy into a nothing or nothing into a tragedy. That's the lens. That's the filter you see through all your interactions come out of that patterns, man. And sometimes the beautiful thing about psychedelics is that it allows you to get outside of you and look at the ridiculousness of you. that's one of the biggest. yeah, that's it. You're talking about change and transformation and things like that. That's been my biggest catalyst and seeing the way I behave and that doesn't mean that I'm mr. Perfect. And then I don't get angry or I'm not a like, yeah, no sleep for six months with a child.

Speaker 1:          02:49:58       We've, we've touched it. I've had though. That's the. Anybody who's had a kid. No. It's like that's fucking a real struggle. There's no perfect people, man. This doesn't exist. That's this idea that there's a perfect person. This is an enlightened being. There are people that choose to go down certain paths that will lead to them making better decisions, lead to them living a more harmonious life, but you're just a monkey. You just some fucking talking ape that's on this planet filled with contradictions and chaos and you're trying to get through like all of us are and who's going to be interrelationship drama in work, drama on and fucking community drama, neighborhood drama, and you're gonna. Sometimes you'll be too stressed out or too tired or too distracted or two too overworked or whatever the fuck it is. You're going to have a bad reaction to those things.

Speaker 1:          02:50:49       It doesn't define you. That's a real problem that people have though, is one bad reaction. Like you yell at your neighbor and your neighbor, fuck you and the cops come you piece of shit. I'm going to slash your tires and fuck you and these things that have. I got a buddy of mine last night, explained to me something that he got into his with his neighbor and uh, he accuses neighbor of slashing his tire and he, he fucking know, like, yelled at his neighbor. And then he got his car picked up by aaa, they changed the tire. they go, no, you hit a curb, curb and deflated his tire. And he was blaming his neighbor, pull the spear out of your mouth right now. Created this whole fall. And he was like. And I was like, he's a comic. I was like, are you going to talk about this on stage?

Speaker 1:          02:51:29       He was like, I can't. I'm too embarrassed now. I'm not ready to like, this isn't funny to me. Yeah. He's like, he's telling me because we're friends, we're both laughing. I'm like, fuck man. Did you apologize to emulate? Not yet. IT was like, god damn it, I don't know what to do. Like because his neighbor would get pissed because he parked in front of his house and the guy had trash cans and he's like, you park it too close to my trash cans. I can't get my trash cans. And I was like, what? And so he goes out, he finds this note on his car and his tires flat. And he assumed that the guy wrote the note tire. Yeah, he's a good guy. But he fucked up, you know, like fuck ups, but if you took those fuck ups and you like, it's all, you concentrate on your whole life all the times you fucked up.

Speaker 1:          02:52:11       Like you're like, oh my god, I'm a fuck up. Like no, you just a person man did. That shit will repeat itself. Like you will fall into the path of that instead of having the humility or at least getting a little help from an outside source that allows you to take a step back, pull the blinders off and see what's going on and be like, you know what man, I fucked up. That's also whY objectivity is so important and introspective thought is so important because sometimes people just make excuses for everything they do. Everything they do, they have a fucking excuse for. So you never get the lessons and you never get the growth. He never learned. You just, you just constantly repeat, constantly repeat. And then one day you're a Bitter old man yelling at these kids to stop what they're fucking rock and roll music and your goddamn car.

Speaker 1:          02:52:56       Driving down my street, we got loud muffler and that's the same shit. He knows his patterns stayed. They fall into these patterns and then they die. And these never, never corrected enough. Never. Never. Just never got it. Never got it right. No introspection. If there's no quiet time. Yeah, we're running out of time. What's it sober called? Kingsborough. You bad motherfucker. This is fun, man. Fuck yeah, we did this. I loved it. so I gotta get one of those bad boys and get my millimolAr millimeters. What does it millimolar. Chella mowers. Checked and blood. The blood ketone meter. So let's do this again man. I think we could probably do this for fucking hours and hours and hours to come back again. One more time. A king's bu on twitter. If you want to get ahold of cow. I put that on my twitter and uh, that's it. Thanks brother. Appreciate it man. Thank you very much brother. Alright my friends, that's it for the week. Oh, we'll be back with a fight companion saturday night. Brandon shot brian callen, eddie bravo and me. So that's a saturday night. We'll be here for the ufc fights. All right, my friends. Bye bye.

Speaker 5:          02:54:16       Listening.
