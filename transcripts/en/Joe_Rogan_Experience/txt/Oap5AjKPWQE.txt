Speaker 3:          00:03:43       Joe Rogan podcasts all day.

Speaker 2:          00:03:48       Ladies and gentlemen. Brian Denny. Thank you sir. Thanks for coming on. The one of the cool things about the internet is that you can get connected to all these weird and unusual folks and you can also exchange a lot of information back and forth and find out a lot of things about each other. And, uh, I, I read about, you know, nothing's coming. This is fun friendly. I read about you and uh, I read some of the things that I didn't know, uh, when you had contacted me that you had included me in your. How many celebrities were there? Eight or 10. It was a top 10. Most wanted celebrities promoting harmful pseudo science. And in that I read about myself and I was shocked to learn that I believe that nine slash 11 was created by the government. I did not know. I didn't know that.

Speaker 2:          00:04:35       I believe that. I don't think you've ever said that. I've never said that. We can talk about the whole genesis of how this list came to be. Well, that's a. But that one is poorly researched. I've absolutely never said that. I think that the government engineered nine slash 11. Well, this was an episode I did in 2008, which was five, six years ago now, and so before coming here today, I wanted to make sure and get all my sources for all of these and unfortunately back in 2008, I was not yet keeping very good records and saving my notes. So for the things that I have listed here, unfortunately I can't give you the source for any one of them, but any one of them you want to tell him he is not true. I will happily retract it. Well, first of all, the nine slash 11 one, 100 percent.

Speaker 2:          00:05:16       In fact, I was on the phone with Alex Jones the night that nine slash 11 happened. The government engineer this documents, they've been planning this since operation northwoods. I'm sure it didn't take him until that night to figure it out. He would probably. Well I think he, he actually might have even predicted it, but when you say that, like people go, Whoa, is he a psychic? He predicted a billion things that never happened. You know, every day camps they've gotten coffins, plastic, coffins. That doesn't mean that uh, he was a clairvoyant. It means he's, he's a tightly, tightly strong, tightly wound up fella. Oh, do you think. But uh, I, we debated it online on the air,

Speaker 1:          00:05:58       like, you know, I was like, how do you, you can't say that there's no evidence that shows that the government did it like you just because you suspect them of doing it, you can't say it. There's also crazy shit that happens in planes flying into buildings. And I have a doctor, not a real good doctor, but he's a pot doctors. Dr Hans you out a medical marijuana prescriptions, but I guess he went to medical school. I go to them the other day and he hands me this book and he's like, uh, this is very important information. And I go, okay. So I start reading it and it's about tesla technology that they use to make the twin towers disappeared. I got that. The twin towers, the reason why they turned into dust and they just didn't fall apart into big chunks is cars. Tesla Tech. I thought he was, I thought it was like having like a, like a mental issue. Like I thought something had blown a fuse or something. I was so confused by the conversation. I didn't know what he was saying. Like you're saying they used unknown technology to make the buildings disappear. How did you know them? He's got a thick book.

Speaker 4:          00:06:54       You see the whole thing. Tesla mythology is a whole other area of, of BS, which is, which is amazing. So many of the things that Tesla is known for never happened. Um, he was, he was certainly a, a very brilliant man. Certainly a, an innovative engineer, but he didn't invent AC. He didn't invent electric motors. These are all things that already existed that he continued working on. He never invented a death ray. He was completely nuts by the time of his life. He said he had a death ray.

Speaker 1:          00:07:22       He and Edison did have the competition or the competing ideas about alternating current and direct current. And he was an advocate of alternating or alternating current where Edison in fact did tests to show or did displays or other demonstrations to show that dangers of this. And one of the things they did is they fried an elephant. Yeah, it's really fucked, man. If you watch it. And he called it westing housing, he called it. We're going to westinghouse, this elephant now. He was hoping that that word would catch on. That's hilarious. So, um, I don't know where you got the nine slash 11 thing from a. But if I had listened to me talk about the moon landing, I'd probably assume that I was also a nonbeliever in nine slash 11. So no, never said that. And it never believed that. The only thing I've ever said that's controversial at all is that tower seven. When you watch it fall, it looks like in controlled demolition. And I don't think that's controversial because it looks like a controlled demolition. Yeah. When you look at just the top half of it, it does. When you look at the whole thing, the way the way the structure, correct.

Speaker 4:          00:08:15       There's no video, the whole thing, you can only see the video of the top. Really the top quarter of it as it disappears behind the building and I agree it does look exactly like a controlled demolition.

Speaker 1:          00:08:24       Oh, I believe it's more than the top quarter. Pull the pull the video up of tower seven dropping. There's some pretty mean. There's at least 30 floors. You're seeing. You're seeing a lot of it. It's not really. I wouldn't say it's the top quarter is a 48 for building. I don't know. I'm not gonna argue the fraction, but you don't see the bottom of it was true, but it is very unusual how it falls into its base instead of the falls over, didn't

Speaker 4:          00:08:47       it felt it started to fall down straight, but then it almost destroyed two other buildings that it fell against. It didn't fall into its own foot. Right. Which any building that they were demolishing would probably do as well if they were that close to each other and that went wrong. Right. Yeah. We'll watch it again here. Look at that. Yeah. That's way more than a tough quarter. Okay. It's not. That's almost the entire building was not. Okay. Let's see. We'll see it again because we caught that in the middle. Let's see it again. Let's see it from the top. This is not the best angle of a bunch of different angles. Okay. Let's say it again. Pull that one back. I mean it disappears into the smoke before you can see, but I think it's a bit disingenuous to say that the thing doesn't fall into its base. Look at that. It doesn't. I mean it's already going at an angle. Look at that. Look at the k, but it all fell to the bottom. I mean, let's look at that one. Get her to fall to the top. Okay, but keep being kind of silly. That thing collapsed into its space. Look at that watch. Here it goes.

Speaker 1:          00:09:43       That is most of the building vanishes out of sight. Who knows what happens from then on and for sure it ran into other buildings. The point is this, it never happened before and it looks like a controlled demolition. I'm not saying, but let me be clarified because this is important. I'm not saying it's a controlled demolition. I know I have no idea, but that's what it looks like to say. It doesn't look like that. It's kind of silly.

Speaker 4:          00:10:04       No, I agree, but if you want to see how it fell into its own base, quote unquote, just look at the aerial photographs that were taken the next day when all the smoke had cleared and you can see that didn't remotely fall into its own base. It fell down the street and just practically destroyed two other buildings so

Speaker 1:          00:10:19       well. That's a matter of all that material has to go somewhere. You had 48 floors of material and all comes down and collapsed. It's going to fly.

Speaker 4:          00:10:26       I'm not saying it didn't fly to the side. It fell over. It doesn't. It didn't fall down and then out tube in all directions like it splattered. It fell over. It started going down and then it went to an angle and fell off to the side.

Speaker 1:          00:10:38       This is a really. This is an interesting thing because this is a thing that a lot of people want the world to be very black and white and they want things like this to be really simple to categorize. I don't think it is and I don't agree with you that that didn't fall into its base. Sure. A lot of other shit happened and probably big chunks of it landed on buildings nearby, but that thing collapsed into its base. Did it collapse into its base because of a gigantic diesel fire that it consumed the innards of the building and weaken the structure considerably? Fuck, for sure. That's possible. I don't know a Goddamn thing about my dad's an architect. You know, I asked him about it and he said, well, it's unusual, but you don't know what the hell is going on inside of it. You don't know what kind of damage sustained from having a building fall out it.

Speaker 1:          00:11:18       You don't know what that diesel fuel burning, what it does. This structure. You don't know how they built the inside of it. Who knows? It's weird, but weird things happen when things break. That was his take on it, but you can't say that that doesn't look like a controlled demolition and I didn't. I said it does look like a controlled demolition. The bodies that you can see, the most controversial thing I've ever said about nine slash 11. I've never said once that I think that the government engineered it or that it was. I think it's very possible that big events happen and then people capitalize on those events and then things happen. Like the invasion of Iraq. They were probably looking for an excuse do it anyway, but the idea that it was all one big grand scheme to me seems ridiculously unlikely.

Speaker 2:          00:12:00       Okay. Let me this, this was actually a good segue into um, what we started to talk about, which was this, this inclusion that I have your back in this rise list of top celebrities promoting pseudoscience. Because what? It's. If someone had just listened to our last five minutes here of the exchange, it sounded like you were trying to convince me that nine slash 11 was a hoax to who were there. Who would say that? I think anyone who listens to that five minutes, it would sound like you were trying to convince me. Building seven was a demolition. No, it wouldn't. Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:12:31       I was very specific that I don't think it's grayer. I don't think it's a black and white issue. I think it's a very gray area. I think that that building looked like it was demolished. Was it demolished? I absolutely don't know. I'm too dumb. I have zero education when it comes to structural engineering zero education when it comes to the damage that a fire can do to a structure and caused it to collapse and big chunks of buildings hitting it. What that can do, I don't know, but when I look at it, it looks like a controlled demolition. That does not sound like I'm trying to convince you that nine slash 11 was a hoax because I said very specifically that I don't think it is, and then I think that it's ridiculous to assume that someone could be so organized that they could talk these guys into flying planes into buildings and that they can make it, that these buildings are rigged with explosives secretly and some clandestine operation with the banks and the NSA and the dea and the CIA. Everyone coordinating together so that we could invade Iraq. It sounds ridiculous

Speaker 2:          00:13:25       if you're a betting man. If you had to bet yes or no. Was nine slash 11 orchestrated by the government? If you had to bet, would you bet on? No, not 100 percent, but I will present that on them 100 percent, but I know, but

Speaker 1:          00:13:37       I wouldn't be surprised if two, two additional possibilities. One, it was something that they knew possibly could happen. It didn't prevent against because either of a and competence or b, you have to look at things like operation northwoods. You have to look at the Gulf of Tonkin. You have to look at real events that took place,

Speaker 2:          00:13:57       meal plans, that were questions. Those are separate questions I would say. I would say there's always the possibility that there was some knowledge of it before, but that. But that's a separate question also. Then they orchestrated it and caused it to happen. I do not have enough faith that the government is so competent that they could pull off this amazingly intricate attack. So if you're 100 percent, if you're 100 percent betting, no question. So that means I might bet no, but it doesn't mind that I'm asking for your personal level of confidence, your opinion and your personal. If you're forcing me to bet, then I would bet no, I never say I know one way or the other. So if I asked you what is your bet on whether building seven was a controlled demolition, are you still 100 percent? No, I certainly wouldn't bet. I certainly wouldn't bet because I don't know enough. But if I looked at it the way, the way, uh, a person who's objective, a person who understands what they know and what they don't know in this life, I would to say it

Speaker 1:          00:14:52       would be pretty fucking difficult to rig a building with explosives and not have anybody know about it. It was pretty fucking difficult to make that building implode and have it be some sort of a secret that people kept. It seems highly unlikely. It seems more likely to me that there's some sort of a catastrophic structural failure. But I would fucking sue the shit out of those people that built that movie, that, that building rather. If I was Larry, what's his name that had a lateral Silverstein, I would sue the fuck out of the people that built that building. I was like, look at this building. Just fall down when it gets on fire like you assholes. I guess he got paid though from insurance, right? He didn't need to do that. If you didn't get that. Part of the conspiracy is that money was made off.

Speaker 1:          00:15:30       The conspiracy, the words, the wording, pull it, pull it out. The fact that you said pull it, it's my my take that anytime there's a any sort of a catastrophic event, whether it's a murder or an accident or anything, there's a bunch of people that look for patterns in the chaos. There's a bunch of people that look for a following plot line and look for some sort of nefarious connections between people that would profit off this event and just the randomness of of chaotic, of being attacked, of of death and about destruction. I think it's more likely that it's more likely that people are looking at this and trying to make some sense out of it, but this crazy chaotic event where there's a bunch of suicide bombers, flew planes into a building.

Speaker 4:          00:16:13       Things you know when? When Neil Tyson was here. How long ago was that? Three, four months ago. Something like that. It's about a year ago. Okay. He was. He was. He was making the point about how he tries very much to give people the tools to. You can't teach everyone all the facts, but you can give people the tools so that they can probably figure out what's true, what's not true, and he made some points about why that's a valuable thing to have, why it's good to have to be able to make good decisions about the way the world works and to understand the way things really happen. And it sounded to me like you've pretty generally agreed with him. Yes. And I would too. Um, so in the case of this nine slash 11 as a, as an example, I mean we've got 100 different conspiracy theories here, et Cetera, et cetera.

Speaker 4:          00:16:56       And not even conspiracy theories, but just playing up pseudosciences it makes just, it makes sense to help people to come to the right conclusion to come to a conclusion. That's probably true because that's symptomatic of all the other areas in their life where they're going to have to consider issues and make up a good informed opinion. That's probably more likely to be true. Wouldn't you agree with that? I mean, that's really the same thing he's saying. So if it then makes sense for you to to to promote the idea that nine slash 11 was probably not a government conspiracy, then why would you spend five minutes showing me this video and bringing it to the, to, to, to the attention of everyone on your show saying, hey, look at this. Look how it was probably a controlled demolition look. I'm sorry. Look how much it looked like a controlled demolition because it does. Because it's interesting. Yeah, but unless you're framing that within the context of look

Speaker 2:          00:17:50       how easy it is to be mistaken, which is not what you said, but why? Why? Why do I have to do that? And to just observe something that's fascinating. You don't have to do it, but what Neil was Tyson was trying to sell you on was the value of doing it. Help. Giving people the tools to understand the way the world probably actually work. How does that relate to you? Listening to me go on about how it looks like a controlled demolition. You agree that it looks like a controlled demolition and just because I'm expressing that, you're saying that if someone listened to that, they think they would think rather than, I'm trying to convince you that nine slash 11 was a hoax. I think that's a giant stretch. It I, I think that's what it sounded like. I think sound like that. To me, the most rational objective people listening, they would have heard all the caveats that I threw in there all the times that I said, now I don't believe this.

Speaker 2:          00:18:36       I don't, but looking at that and watching it collapse like that, it looks like a controlled demolition. I think you'd be a fool to disagree. It looks exactly like that. Is it one? That's not what I'm saying. I don't know. I've said very clearly. I know nothing about architecture architecture. I know nothing about engineering. I know nothing about the impact of diesel fire on concrete and steel. I don't know. Okay. Well, let me go back again to how this is a good segue to what I wrote back in 2000, which hopefully the end result of me being here today will be. I will get back to all my listeners and say, I'm retracting your appearance on this list. Okay, so just a paragraph. You know. Okay. If I read this short, so I think you were a number eight on my list of top 10 celebrities who promote harmful pseudoscience, and here's the paragraph that I wrote on you.

Speaker 2:          00:19:24       Number eight, Joe Rogan, comedian Joe Rogan does what he can to promote virtually any conspiracy theory that he stumbles onto apparently accepting them all uncritically where they wholesale embrace. Now, I know you would disagree with that. Now, of course it would and I want to give you that chance so I'm me. Continue. He believes the Apollo astronauts did not land on the moon. He believes the US government was behind the nine slash 11 terrorist attacks. He believes the Oliver Stone version of the Kennedy assassination. He believes aliens crashed at Roswell in 1947 and the government is covering it up. He thinks men and black from project blue book stole his friend's camera even though project blue book ended over 38 years ago. My friend was tanny 60, by the way. I didn't steal his Canada, what to hear that story, but they took it when he was a little boy.

Speaker 2:          00:20:11       He took a photo of something. Who knows what it was. I never said it was project blue book guys, are they? I told you what? My friend who was a flight surgeon told me I wish to hell I had that. I had the reference for that, but let me just fits. Okay, well that's part of the call Steve and get them on the phone. Steve Graham. That'd be fun. Actually, the worst part is that he promotes these ideas to the public at every interview opportunity, but gives himself the intellectual get out of jail free card of not needing any evidence by hiding behind the childish debate technique of saying, Hey, I'm just the guy asking questions. God, this makes me sound like an asshole. Well, it's just factually inaccurate on so many different levels. I don't

Speaker 1:          00:20:47       understand why you wrote it like that, like there's things that you said that I believe that I don't, that I've never said that I do. What I'm willing to do is look stupid and by talking about things and saying that looks like a controlled demolition. I know that puts you in the the nutter camp, but I'm not saying it's a controlled demolition, but I say that not being willing to debate it and being insecure to discuss it rather not debate it, but to discuss the reality of what you're viewing is silly. It's preposterous. It doesn't mean I'm promoting the idea that nine slash 11 was an inside job or that it was a plot by the government. I don't think that. I've never thought that, but I do think that building looks like a controlled demolition. That's all. I don't think there's anything wrong with saying that.

Speaker 1:          00:21:29       I think. I think at the time that I did this, I think you had. It was shortly after when you went on Penn Jillette's radio show and talked with Phil plait about the moon. Remember that? Sure. And you kicked his butt. Well, unfortunately, look, I would not have handled that the way I handle it then today, but there's two unfortunates. One was that I really wanted him when we first went on to give me a reason to not believe what this Fox documentary showed me, but the more I talked to him, the more I realized that he was almost like talking in in a religious sense in that he wasn't willing to criticize any aspect of, of NASA or any aspect of what was going on during that time, including the point where he was trying to deny the fact that Werner Herzog or Wernher von Braun rather, and many other scientists were actually Nazis that would come over and operation paperclip and he's like, you know, he's trying to deny that there were Nazis.

Speaker 1:          00:22:24       I'm like, well, this is crazy. Like you're trying to deny historical fat because you think that historical fact shades NASA in a bad way, and I don't think it does. I think the NASA of 1969 or [inaudible] 63 when Kennedy was in office is not the NASA of 2013 or 14. These. These people are long dead and gone, and to deny that there was a bunch of Nazis involved. Seems to me that's not healthy. It seems to me like it's fucking with the facts and it doesn't support your argument. In fact, it makes me question all the other stuff, so then I started getting aggressive with them because I'm like, well, you're being silly because this isn't. You're not. You're not being honest about the Nazis. You're not being honest about this connection. Okay, well I got to throw that back at you. What the hell does, whether they're not twos or not have anything to do with whether we went to the moon?

Speaker 1:          00:23:05       Well, it doesn't, but denying the fact that there were Nazis has something to do with what kind of information I'm getting from him. I'm not getting unbiased information. Well, I don't remember. I don't remember that part of the conversation, but I remember that Wernher von Braun had gone to Antarctica to pick, to collect rocks to collect meteors and you brought that up and I think you said words to the effect of why the heck would he have done that? Unless it was part of some grander scheme to fake bringing rocks back from the mood. Am I correct about that? I said, well, I said Wernher von Braun did go to Antarctica. You did. When they were preparing for the moon landing, and Phil Phil had no idea. In fact, I think he said he had never even heard that fact when I was a lot of photos online of Wernher von Braun and this big crew.

Speaker 1:          00:23:44       There was one of the few places where they could go. They could study meteors that were definitely from the moon. Right, and fill it, fill. It, fills an astronomer. He's not a space historian. I understand. He would have no reason to know that, but why? Why were you bringing that up? What does that have to do with the question? Well, the big conspiracy was of course that he had brought these rocks back from there, and then somehow or another, those were the ones that they forged for the moon rocks. When they talked about where'd they get these rocks from the moon? Well, there's absolutely meteors that came from the moon that are in Antarctica. You can find them, they can retrieve them. They've documented that so that the idea is that you have a chunk of the moon. Here's, here's the rocks we brought back from the moon.

Speaker 1:          00:24:21       We want to know what to look for. We want to know what their, what kind of mass they've got, things like that to how to, how to make room for them in the spaceship. Yeah. What they're made out of, what their contents are, and as an alternative that could be seen as being consistent with the moon landing was exactly, exactly. What would you call it? Evidence or would you call it consistent with. Or would you say those are the same thing? I wouldn't say it's evidence. I mean, look, all you. Let's say that they could land on the moon. Okay. Let's say, which by the way, I believe now and let's say that, uh, they took spaceships and they went there and they brought back moon rocks. I think if you knew for sure that there were some moon rocks in Antarctica, you would absolutely go there and study them.

Speaker 1:          00:25:00       I don't think it's a bad thing, but I do think that if you're a guy looking for something that confirms your suspicions of a of a conspiracy, which I was, I would say, well look, they went to get moon rocks and that's [inaudible]. That's the big thing. They always say they brought back x kilograms of moon rocks where they get those. They went to Antarctica, they got them from the Antarctica. And look, here's a photo of Warner von Braun in Antarctica collecting moon rocks with a fucking cast on his arm for some strange reason. How'd he break his arm? Do you know? I, I didn't know that he had some old school cast to mad. Some fucking funky cartoon casts with like a bar between them. He must've really jacked his arm, but they probably broke his arm to get him to lie about going to the moon.

Speaker 1:          00:25:37       See, I've got it all locked up. Yeah. Look, I, like I said, I wouldn't have, I wasn't podcasting then. And uh, I certainly wasn't watching as many documentaries and reading these many books. I wasn't. I was in the middle of doing fear factor in working for the UFC and I'd watched this documentary on the Fox, the Fox documentary on a conspiracy theory. Did we really go to the moon and it was incredibly compelling, especially if you're a retard like me and you're watching Brian O'leary, who was an astronaut saying that he could see that they could fake it and you're watching bill casing. It was the guy who worked at Rocketdyne and he said that the engineers all agree that no one could do this, and then you look at the different backgrounds that they showed in different trips and they were basically the same background, but they were nowhere near each other.

Speaker 1:          00:26:21       They had done it. They've done a really good job of piecing together all this weirdness and then do it with a narrator and spell it out for you and I bought it. Hook, line, and sinker for sure. The the real issue. There's a bunch of real issues with faking the moon lane. Of course, the numbers of people that would be involved, the amount of technology that you would have to discount where people could track lunar module as it went in the lineage of creating the Saturn five and how they see the stages of detached and all the different mathematical calculations they did create them, but if you break it down to an hour documentary for a dummy and you put some spooky music in it and you keep cutting back and forth to commercials, you're going to believe that we didn't go to the moon.

Speaker 4:          00:27:02       Yeah, it's the easiest ID in the world to sell. Conspiracy theories are so just people want to believe them. They satisfy so much. They're fun to fund. It makes you feel like you've got some secret insider information, but there's also. There was evidence that

Speaker 1:          00:27:17       NASA did fake some publicity shots. They did from the Gemini Program, Michael Collins, they used a photo of him where he was in a simulator and they used it and they blacked it out and had the exact same image and released it as a press photo. So what is this deception? Does that mean that there was deception across the board? No, but I did this Saifai show and in the middle of the Scifi show, someone who is an editor took some footage and spliced in some sound and faked something and said that a user centered in not to my knowledge and I found out about it and freaked out and I said, well, when you fake one thing, like we, we spent this entire show trying to figure out the truth about something and you guys for dramatic effect faked one thing, you fucked up the whole show because what you did is you cast doubt on everything else this show is ever going to say ever.

Speaker 1:          00:28:09       Like literally hast almost die right here because you're the ethic of creating a completely honest show has already been gone. It's already been washed away. And when you watch something like the moon landing and you know, you look at the, these guys hopping around on the moon, you kind of almost want it to be bullshit. Kind of like what they fuck. They got to. Come on man. How the fuck you look up at the moon? Have Fuck, are they getting up there and then you find shit like this where they show these images of, you know, Michael Collins in the simulator and then the exact image all blacked out background saying that he's actually in space like, oh, he's in Spain. Who's taken this picture of him in space like this? He's not in space. This is the same image. Like you guys lied. So because of that, NASA is, they're not perfect.

Speaker 1:          00:28:55       They weren't perfect in the fact that they hired a bunch of Nazis and brought them over from, from Germany. They weren't perfect in the fact that, you know, I'm sure some people in the publicity department told some tall tales and spun some yarns and you know, they had a makeup for Gus Grisham dying in that simulator. There's a lot of like horrible publicity, snafoos terrible things that went wrong that eroded people's confidence in, in NASA. I could easily see a fake here or there a photograph that was that was staged here or there that they said happened on the moon or that they said happened in space. I don't think that that means necessarily that the moon landing was faked though then I did.

Speaker 4:          00:29:38       Yeah. I mean it's, it's, it's pretty common piece of feedback that I'll get when

Speaker 2:          00:29:42       I do an episode on any, any given conspiracy theory and let's say it's one like this that involves the government. The, the feedback that I'll get is so you believe the government loves us and is perfect and everything they do, it's like, oh, it's not necessary for NASA to be perfect for us to have gone to the moon. It's not necessary for the government to be perfect for nine slash 11, not to have been an incense. The classic Straw man. Black and white argument. Yeah. No, it's. You're either and that's exactly what I said about the building collapsing. It's basically the same thing. It's not. It doesn't mean that the government is beautiful and perfect in every way because they managed to go to the bone. Agreed. Yeah. So should we go through this checklist here? Which of these I can take off? Yeah. What was, what was the other one?

Speaker 2:          00:30:22       You had another one that I. let's start with a violently disagreed with it. Was was the first one. Oh, fascination. Okay. He believes the Apollo astronauts didn't land on the moon. That's gone. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Okay. That's good. I'm checking it off. I would love it if it was a hoax style. If I found out that it was a hoax, I got to tell you right now. I would love it almost more than I love the fact that people went to the moon. I would love it if it was a hoax. Capricorn won. Best movie ever. No, it wasn't. It wasn't even close. It was a good movie, but alien was the best movie. Alien one, the first one in my opinion, and it had, it had the evil corporate government conspiracy behind it. Um, I do not believe in knowledge over stones, in fact, have criticized that film on this podcast many times because Oliver stone created in the Donald Sutherland character.

Speaker 2:          00:31:05       They can use this vehicle for this general that's giving him this information in order to spell it all out to the Kevin Costner character. I've never said that. You know what I've said. I said, if you look at that bullet, it doesn't look like went through people. That's what I've said, because if you look at the single bullet, it does not look like it penetrated bone. See that bones are. You see that Scott? I'm a hunter. I'm an actual bonafide hunter. I know what it looks like when bullets hit meet and that that bullet does not look like it went through to people. Did you beat the fuck out of that thing? Nice to save any. I have some. I'll get you some you like. Do you like venison? I love it. I just got one in Wisconsin last month. Relatives in Oregon. They're sending us stuff all the time.

Speaker 2:          00:31:44       The best meat. It's so delicious and so healthy and I like the fact that it's wild. It's running around wild and then you take it out of the mix, but I've never said that Oliver Stone was right. In fact, I've said there was A. I liked the movie, I think Kevin Costner and knocked it out of the park. I think it was an interesting movie, but what I've like about it is that it opens up this idea where people start to question what happened. Okay. I, I think what I, what I meant by that statement was you. You don't believe that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone. I do not believe Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone. No, I think there's ample evidence that there was other people involved, but that doesn't mean that Lee Harvey Oswald wasn't involved. There's another black or white thing. Everybody wants an either or. I think it's very possible that Lee Harvey Oswald was in cahoots with that murder. First of all, Lee Harvey Oswald was on the scene. Second of all, Lee Harvey Oswald was known to be in bed with all these fucking Weirdo characters he had brought. He had gone Russia and

Speaker 1:          00:32:40       brought back a woman and was allowed to reenter the United States. The fact that Jack Ruby got to Lee Harvey Oswald and the really high pressure situation, she shot the fucking president and you just have them wandering through with this gangster can run up to them and put a bullet in him. It plays out like a movie, so in fact, so you've got a lot of anomalies that are consistent with any conspiracy, conspiracy and but my take on it is not that I know or that I believe in Oliver Stone. My take on it is what a colossal strange event, a changing of us history, a changing of the way we look at the power of being a president, a changing of the way we look at what can happen to someone in this lifetime. When someone who is so beloved as John F Kennedy disappears off the face of the earth and the world instantaneously changes.

Speaker 1:          00:33:31       I think it's a fascinating story and I also think it's fascinating how many enemies he had. You can't discount when you're talking about people who were involved with people who have created wars, people who have absolutely been responsible for the death of untold thousands of people. You can't discount the idea that they would organize a coup. I don't know if they did, but I do know that that thing was one colossal clusterfuck, a crazy thing, and that the fact that the film was held back until her Waldo Rivera of all people put it on television with Dick Gregory who bought a lot of people, don't even realize is a great comedian, was a great comedian and an activist at the time. And it was way into the seventies that Dick Gregory played this on Geraldo Rivera show. And you get to see Kennedy's head snapped back. And this router film.

Speaker 1:          00:34:18       I don't think that that means that someone else did it. I think it means there's probably more than one person involved. And when you look at the Warren Commission report and you look at the inconsistency is in it. There's a great book about it called the best evidence by David Lifton, who was, um, he was actually an accountant and was hired to go over the Warren Commission report and found inconsistency after inconsistency over and over again, and detailed these in great order. But the difference in the inconsistency of the autopsies and consistencies of the various reports of what went down in consistencies in the Warren Commission of their findings that would cancel out each other's findings. He was one of the few guys were the first guys to go through the entire 900 volumes. Fascinating. Fascinating book that I read when I was living in New Jersey. I was living in New York rather, and it was doing a Gig on the road and I read it and fucking bombed that night.

Speaker 1:          00:35:10       Oh my God. It was in my hotel room all day reading is freaky conspiracy books. Shit in my pants and I was like 23 years old. And then I went on stage that night and just had terrible and I learned a very valuable lesson from that book. Don't read or watch depressing shit right before you go onstage or break into big conspiracy mongering in the middle of your set that you just know. Nobody came to conspiracy freak for sure for sure. That book best evidence was what threw me over the top. Well, you know, I did an episode on, on, on

Speaker 4:          00:35:38       the JFK assassination a about a month or two ago and I'd been putting it off for years because there is so much, so much bs and so much real information on that. Then I found this is, this is impossible. How am I going to distill this into a 12 minute show because my son was 12 minutes, 12 minutes long every week. That's insane. You need to spread out. Yeah. So what, what, um, what I decided to do is not to address any of the conspiracy theories, but just talk about why in general, the conspiracy theories individual and myriad as they are, why they don't stand up to, you know, what's, what we, what we, um, unfortunately called the official story quote unquote, kind of a weasel word. Um, and it really, the thing is that what all conspiracy theories have in common is that they are united only in that they dispute the official story.

Speaker 4:          00:36:34       For example, you can say the, the Cubans Killed Kennedy, or you can say the Russians killed Kennedy. Or you can say the mob killed Kennedy. Or you can say the secret service men running alongside, accidentally shot him, whatever. And all the people who promote those conspiracies, they, they consider themselves united as a group even though their theories are absolutely factually exclusive of one another. Almost like competing religions. They. Yeah, exactly. They, they cannot possibly be, be brought together. The only thing they have in common is that they simply say the government's lying. And as long as you say the government's lying than hey, you're, you're okay. You're in the club. Your theories. All right? Your theory is more likely that that's the government to find out. We're talking about this. It's, it's happened. It's happened.

Speaker 4:          00:37:22       You right? You know Vince Bugliosi his book. I didn't like it. What was it called? Case closed case or whatever. Okay. Was called case closed. He talked about, I can't remember what it was called, so I'll accept that in us. We don't have to accept anything. This is google. He talked about one. One person that he interviewed who believed posner too. Sterile pose. Nurse case closed. Okay. He believes one person he interviewed, um, believed that Kennedy was still alive and likely and that he had committed suicide. Uh, yes. I heard the, the secret service man shot him. I heard A. I heard like you could see him shoot him on the, on the video for that. Okay. The driver shot him. Yeah. Yeah. The driver turned around. So even, even having, even even one person having their own belief that is self contradictory seems more likely than believing what the government says and the government obviously is not perfect, but you can't. You cannot say that just because the government agrees with one particular version of events that that event is therefore wrong. You're right. And that's a huge, hugely popular argument that I get reclaiming history.

Speaker 1:          00:38:36       Fascinating. I didn't read this. I read the other one. You're right. However, it doesn't disclude the possibility that there was in fact some sort of a conspiracy. No, it certainly doesn't, but the fact that the, that the government found one version of the events more compelling and wrote their official version on that doesn't make that version of wrong. You're right. And that's the hardest. That's the hardest point to communicate to the people who believe that it certainly doesn't. The inconsistencies that are troubling in the Warren commissions are part are. There's several, but one of the big ones is the single bullet theory or the need for the single bullet theory. The reason why they needed to formulate the single bullet theory is because they had an account for three shots. They had a new bullet that it hit ricocheted against the curbs, term kerbstone on under the overpass, and a guy had gotten hit by the ricochet, so he was in the hospital and they had seen the mark on the curb stone, so they attributed that to a bullet.

Speaker 1:          00:39:25       So they say, okay, well we know for sure someone was shooting from the direction the school book depository. That's one thing. Then that confirmed actually supporting the idea that Oswaldo did it or that someone in Oswald's position did it. So bullet did come from there, but now they had to account for all these wounds and so how did they do that? Well, instead of saying, well, maybe there was more than one bullet, maybe there was more than three shots. Maybe there was more than two people shooting. They had to come up with some sort of a reason why one bullet could do all this damage. That to me seems a much less likely scenario. Then there's more than one shooter. The more than one shooter. If you're going to kill the fucking president and if there is a conspiracy and we haven't proven that there's not more that there is, but if there's going to be a conspiracy, I would doubt you would give it to one guy named Lee Harvey Oswald, one guy and give them a rifle that's not even that fucking good and put them in a window and given this crazy shot that most people are not going to make.

Speaker 1:          00:40:17       That's not a good shot. If you've ever shot at something. Moving targets are incredibly difficult and moving targets. When you're. You have this shitty bolt action rifle and you got to reload it. It's a long time to do that. You can get it off if you. I mean, I've seen the people that have pulled it off in a test where they've said try to reproduce it and they can do it. You can get those shots off and you can do, but you're not going to be accurate. You need a couple of seconds to be accurate. You need your fucking shooting the president. This is not some low pressure situation. This is the first person you've ever assassinated with a rifle. My position is that it's more likely that they had a predetermined outcome that they were trying to reach that outcome is that they wanted to tie up everything with Lee Harvey Oswald and one of the best ways to do that.

Speaker 1:          00:41:02       It's an attribute all these different wounds to one bullet. Does it mean that all those wounds were not created by one bullet? No, because it's one of the weird things that happens when you shoot things. Things hit bone and they ricochet and they go weird directions and strange anomalies happen to bullets where a bullet will kill someone and you'll look at it. It looks like it's virtually undisturbed. Every now and then shit gets weird, but for the most part when a bullet goes through to people and shatters bone and both of them, especially the risk of connolly on the, on the end of it, and then winds up in the Gurney in this pristine form like the single bullet theory did when they found that bullet. That's unlikely.

Speaker 4:          00:41:39       I've got A. I've got a 50 caliber round that that we found in death valley leftover from the days when they would do fighter planes just shooting their machine guns over from China Lake and what what it. What it is is I'm a completely flattened, smudged, irreconcilable piece of copper and protruding out from the center of it is this absolutely pristine tungsten missile that looks like it's fresh from the factory, absolutely sharp, completely undamaged, and it's inside this copper jacket that is. That's been peeled what? Peeled away from it and completely smashed out to to unrecognizable. It's real effect. When I found it, we're looking at going, what the heck is this? Is this a bullet that somebody shot into something and it's still hanging on? Yeah, so I understand what a really, really weird stuff can go on with bullets. Weird stuff can go on with bullets. One of my favorite paper, so I have to talk about it.

Speaker 1:          00:42:35       Yeah, I'm a, I'm a, I'm really getting into ballistics lately. I've been doing a lot of target shooting and talking to a. I have a very good friend, my friend Justin who is a, a complete gun nut and if I have any questions about ballistics and, and things, I will talk to him about it. And uh, you know, he'll tell you like weird shit happens sometimes you shoot a person and the bullet will come back at you through there. I like, that's happened to guys like guys and special forces. They've assassinated somebody or killed somebody and the bullet hits bone and somehow or another figures out a way to pop out of their eye,

Speaker 4:          00:43:06       like slides around the inside of the.

Speaker 1:          00:43:08       Somebody's trying other somehow or another ricochets in. Well there's, you know, there's random weird shit that can happen when you shoot people. So is it possible that a bullet went to Kennedy and then went into connolly? Yeah. One hundred percent weird shit happens, but does it look like that bullet did that? Not at all. No. It looks like that bullet. They fired into a tank of water. That bullet doesn't look like it hit anything because it's a lead bullet that's jacketed and the jacket isn't bent. It's not disturbed. And to my knowledge, people have tried to recreate that. I know Penn and teller tried to do it. I think miss mythbusters tried to do it. They weren't able to do it. When they hit bone, they were only able to do. If they pass just through the flesh, you can pass through flash and leave a bullet relatively undisturbed, but if you hit bone and you shatter that bone, most likely you're making a mess out of that bullet.

Speaker 1:          00:43:52       Didn't they find pieces in the body also? Absolutely. In pieces in Connolly's wrist that did not match what was missing from the bullet. There was more pieces in connally's body. Then we're missing from the bullet. Does that mean that he didn't get hit with some, you know, random shrapnel and bullets are fucking flying and weird shit happens and you know, there's a lot of weird shit that goes on when you're in a gunfight, but I think you would probably have to attribute that to more than three bullets. Aliens in Roswell never said that. In fact, have a joke goofing on it on my, on my comedy special from 1999 where I say that, uh, that people say the government actually printed in the paper. They have recovered a crashed Ufo and alien bodies and the next day they made a mistake up. Sorry. It was just a weather balloon.

Speaker 1:          00:44:36       Like, well, what about the aliens? Those are Mexicans. Apparently they were on the balloon. They were drinking, some shenanigans took place. They mistook the balloon for opinion. It's very tragic. You know, I never said that. I think that what I did say that is absolutely fascinating and fun thing to think about. The fact that they could have found some crashed ufo from another planet and hushed everybody up and hit these bodies and little child's coffins run away with them, but everybody that I've talked to that has ever told me a story about being abducted by Ufos are taken aboard a craft or any of their fucking crazy. That's the one thing they all share. They all share this nutty disconnect with reality. I've talked to people that have told me some weird things about animals. I talked to a woman that was very convincing that told me she had a bigfoot sighting, very convincing, less shroud.

Speaker 1:          00:45:26       Who's the survivor man told me some animal was by beetles running through the woods and that, but as far as you iphones, I'm still waiting for the one guy who tells me anything that makes sense. I got in a hundred arguments with people when I was filming the Scifi show that were believers. When I was asking them for evidence. I was like, well, where's the evidence? Like we have sworn affidavits. I go, that's not evidence. I go, he goes, that is evidence. That's evidence in a court of law. You can convict people for murder unless I go, that's not scientific evidence like, Oh, you have a story. That's all you have is a story. Nobody wants there to be aliens more than me, but all I see when I go looking for aliens is a bunch of unfuckable white dudes with stories about spaceships and flying saucers and all sorts of things that make their regular, mundane, boring life seem insignificant because of this greater threat, greater mystery, greater enigma, this huge thing that's going on where we being observed by aliens.

Speaker 1:          00:46:22       It adds this excitement to an otherwise mundane life. And does that mean that there are no aliens? Absolutely not. Does it mean that aliens aren't observing us? Absolutely not, but it does mean is that the consistency that I've found in talking to people that claimed to vet alien experiences make me think that the aliens are so intelligent that they only picked dummies. They're so intelligent that they pick people that were easily discounted. So you listened to their stories and go, go ahead. Tell somebody who the fuck is going to believe you. You're crazy. So they find people that have a problem with the truth and then abduct them. That's, that's the only thing that makes sense. How would you call your. Would you describe yourself as a science advocate? One hundred percent? Yes. I'm a huge fan of science. It's one of the things that I forgot to argue with Stefan Molyneux when he was on the podcast recently. Not argued, but he argues against funding, scientific research and space exploration. And to me it is, it fuels my day if I get up in the morning and I read about some new thing that they're doing where, I mean even I've been following this idea of putting a man mission on Mars and these people that are going to have to go there on is one way trip and my fucking hands sweat just thinking about it. Those things fuel my day. I'm by science,

Speaker 2:          00:47:30       absolutely fascinated by science.

Speaker 4:          00:47:33       I the, the thing that I love, um, uh, doing, doing the scaphoid episodes, my favorite part of it is solving the mysteries that people usually leave unsolved because they stop at the paranormal explanation. For example, the whole Williamson Roswell, take that as an example. If you take the national enquirer version of events, it's sensational and it's fun. Aliens are here, aliens or visiting us, the government's coming here, but it's got all of that, all the compelling qualities of a story that we love, but the fact is that those people haven't solved the mystery and what I enjoy most is completing the process, going all the way through it actually, you know, actually finding the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. Actually finding the solution to what happened

Speaker 2:          00:48:18       whenever possible, well isn't what makes it exciting to these people that you never really can do that unless you can get a time machine and go back to Roswell, New Mexico in 1940. What is it? Seven? Was it seven, nine, 47 years? I have the actual front page of the Roswell daily record on my home framed. Oh, do you? Very cool. It's fascinating. What's also fascinating historically, just to look at all the other things that were in the news that were stories and try to picture yourself living at this time, and I'll 70 years ago. It's weird 77 years ago, but the other thing that's weird about it is that you can't go back so you can't know. You got a bunch of different people and some of them tell you they saw aliens. Someone tell you to say bodies and Max Roswell's, Maxwell, Brazel, whatever the fuck his name was, swingers and all these different people. And then you'd see the press conference where they have this to look. It's just this stuff, you know, it's so delicious to think in terms of conspiracy to think in terms that the government has this unbelievable magical information that they're not sharing with us because they don't think that we can handle it and it becomes this thing that makes every average everyday life more exciting.

Speaker 4:          00:49:18       And in on that same vein in the question of going all the way back to building seven, for example. Um, to me, let's say, let's say, I don't think it is an open question, but let's say the open question of whether it was a, a, a government conspiracy or not, let's say we're just going to leave that unsettled. Okay. We don't know, maybe, maybe it was, maybe it wasn't, but to me what's really interesting about that is the underlying science is how would a building made of steel and covered with concrete or whatever it was made of, how would that melt, why would it collapse and understanding the actual scientists to me, far more interesting than simply doing this anomaly hunting that, that is so much more popular and trying to point fingers and turn it into a whole political, ideological thing. Absolutely. What is your background? What is your education? And uh, my, my back, my background is in computer science and, but uh, I, I never, I never really worked in the field. I was um, um, I did software consulting basically for most of my career until I became a science writer about the six, seven years ago. How would you feel if someone with no software knowledge whatsoever started criticizing software development that you were involved with? If they were, say like an architect?

Speaker 4:          00:50:36       Since I was always really bad at it. I know I would say just as you expect, I'd say, well, I probably know better than you do right now. When you see architects and engineers for nine slash 11 truth. When you see this group of people, how many architects are involved? Brian Google that shit. Architects and engineers from nine slash seven. Truth. There's a substantial number of people, but unfortunately it's something of the people who actually are in that field and most of them are not. Um, it's a tiny fraction of a percentage of all the people who work in that period overall. Right? So if you're trying to look at what most architects and engineers say, overwhelmingly, they have no problem with quote unquote theater, honestly, that it's been studied by most

Speaker 1:          00:51:16       architects and engineers. And again, just for the record, again, I'm not, I don't believe in a conspiracy to for nine slash 11. I never have. But I'm saying that, you know, this is kind of throws in the face of what you said, like these are educated people, they were trained as architects and engineers and they have this,

Speaker 4:          00:51:32       this issue with building 72,000, 134 architects and engineers. That's kind of a lot. I will say this, the people who have spent the most time on the question are overwhelmingly believers in the conspiracy of course, but whereas the causal relationship there, it's not that they spent most time learned the most information and then made a rational decision based on what they learned. It's the other way around. They spend time obsessing with it because they were ideologically married to the idea from the very beginning.

Speaker 1:          00:52:03       If you say that that dismisses them and that's a good thing to say if you try to dismiss them, but I don't think you know them and I don't think you've really examine why they came to these conclusions or why they were interested in interested in investigating it in the first place. Well, this is what I do for a living is I talk to the stand. I understand that, but what I'm saying is I know you didn't interview 2000 people. He didn't ask all those different guys, so the say that in a blanket general statement that this is the reason why they came to this conspiracy is a little disengaged.

Speaker 4:          00:52:30       He was absolutely. Generalizations are always wrong.

Speaker 1:          00:52:35       I think that's a real issue and I think that's what we're dealing with here. Where you had this reluctance to accept the fact that I wasn't saying that nine slash 11 was an inside job just because I was saying tower seven looks like a demolition. It's the same thing. Like if I listened to this, I would think that you're trying to convince it. No, no, it's not. It's not a black and white issue. There's a lot of weirdness. There's a lot of weirdness in the world and there's a lot of weirdness and perception. There's a lot of weirdness in people that are educated but are also incorrect. It's a common thing. It happens all the time and you're absolutely correct at 2000 people out of what number of vast number of architects and engineers there exists in the world, but the real question is how many of those other people that exist have examined this as thoroughly as these people and you're right, the ones that would examine it, the ones who are looking to find some sort of conspiracy, does that mean they're wrong? Well, in this case, you and I both believe that they're wrong, but that doesn't mean they're wrong.

Speaker 4:          00:53:27       Well, there's. There's not a lot of people realistically who work in the field of failure analysis for building structure, but those who do, my guess is, and people can call in and tell me I'm wrong. Shouldn't no one can call in. We shouldn't. That's not good. That's my, my. My supposition is that is that the people who work in building analysis, failure analysis of buildings had no problem with what they saw happening on telly. I wouldn't guess that that's going to go on Jesus. They didn't need to. Well, because I mean it's, it's clear if you just watch any documentary on the, on how the structure collapsed. Well, if those people that

Speaker 1:          00:54:02       believe in the engineers and architects for nine slash 11 truth created a documentary, maybe it would be convincing in the other way. You know what I mean? It really depends on what perspective you're coming from when you were uneducated about the subject as you are. I were kind of crazy and making a conclusion one way or another.

Speaker 4:          00:54:20       Okay. That's true. But I mean there's a certain amount of information that's widely available about how the building was constructed according to those guys, according to the people who make it widely available. Who knows? Who really built the building. They built those buildings in New York. That's a part of the problem. They're skimping on the concrete and fucking Joey, what's up with this old rebar? The thing's going to fall down during a generalization about New Yorkers here, but my people come. The dirt. She stay down. No, I

Speaker 1:          00:54:49       what my issue with all this is is that you, you, you came to this, this instant conclusion that I probably would have reached as well about me about certain subjects. Well, if he believes as he probably believes that if he's discussed this, then he believes that if he's discussed that, then he believes that he's promoting dangerous pseudoscience, but I'm not. I mean I certainly have promoted a nonsensical idea in that we never went to the moon, but it was based on a lot of really fascinating, weird pieces of evidence that are really amazing. Once you start going down that rabbit hole and following them and watching the, the Neil Armstrong speech that he gives the 25 year anniversary speech where he talks about removing truths, hidden layers and all this weird cryptic shit that he did and then all the shit. When you're looking at the videos of them bouncing around where it looks like they're on trampolines.

Speaker 1:          00:55:40       If you're inclined to be conspiratorial, it's all there for you. The speech from President Clinton's book where he talks about when he was working with a carpenter, when the first moon landings took place in the carpenter, told them that he didn't believe anything. Those TV fellers said that they could show they could fake anything and put it on TV, and he said, back then I thought that guy was a quack, but during all my years in the White House, I started to think maybe he was just ahead of his time. That's, that's Bill Clinton in his book said that. So if you conspiratorially minded, you start looking, you know, confirmation bias. You start looking for things to confirm your idea. Look at these intersecting shadows, man. You know, look at this picture. Pictures fake. Even if that picture is fake, it still doesn't mean

Speaker 4:          00:56:16       go to the moon and consequently, if you're inclined to think that nine slash 11 was a government conspiracy, you're going to be of the people who spends the

Speaker 2:          00:56:23       most time, quote unquote studying it, which really makes means reading the same stuff that confirms your belief on the Internet. Most likely. Or you could be someone who's absolutely obsessed with proving that nine slash 11 was not an inside job, and you could, you can chase that down and look at the conspiracy of confirmation bias that resulted in all these crazy books and documentaries and all these different things where people came to these erroneous conclusions. Who spends the most time looking at pictures of Ufo pilots, astronomers or asleep checks. Get a couple more of these. Um, yeah. Um, I would imagine it's people that are obsessed and I would imagine that a lot of those people were obsessed. They are entertaining unhealthy ideas. Okay. Now that's what I said though, a minute ago when we were talking about architects and engineers on nine slash 11, and you kind of jumped on my logic, but that's not the.

Speaker 2:          00:57:15       But that's different. We're talking about people that are observing it, not people who are trained in that field. When you get 2000 plus 2000, 100 people that are trained in that field. Me personally as a non architect and non-engineer, I have to look at it a little bit differently. There's, there's nobody more trained in Ufo log than you. Apologists. No, no, no, no. Me. I am the most trained in, in euphology. You don't even know. I'm the guy. If you have any questions to use this because I just got it. Do you need a go to guy? I will give those guys ecstasy and strippers and will, will cure all this. Search in the skies. Bunch of unfuckable white dudes. That's what we're dealing with, Brian. That's the real issue. But you're right. In some ways you're right in some ways and we agree in some ways and, and I absolutely agree with you that I've been 100 percent irrational in the past about certain things and also I get caught up when I get into a discussion with something about like, like Phil plait with the Moon landings.

Speaker 2:          00:58:09       I'll get caught up in trying to be correct or I'll get caught up, caught up and trying to counter his moves and treat it like it's a Jujitsu match. You know what I mean? Why didn't you just make it a Jujitsu match that weren't even in the room together? We were in the room together. It probably would've worked out better. He was on the phone and I was on the phone once. I was in studio once. He was in studio once and we were on the phone once. Okay, look, let me ask you this question. Are we on time, by the way? I have no idea. I know we can go as long as we wanted. Um, we don't have a boss. One of, one of the things that, um, that I, that I put in my, in my paragraph about you, which I hope to, would love to completely redirect, was a criticism of what you say so often.

Speaker 2:          00:58:45       It's just that I'm just the guy asking him questions. Shouldn't we be looking at this? Shouldn't we be asking these questions? Am I saying that you. Am I saying that right now? I have said that asking questions, Joe Rogan questions everything. Oh yeah. So, right. But when I'm. Well, if you go, that's not a good example because if you go over that, it's me destroying pseudoscience. If you go over that show, it's like I got attacked by more people that fucking believe in chem trails because of that show, explaining the actual science behind this. The thing that I sent you with Rosanne where I explained the science behind jet engines. Great job by the way. I thought you did a wonderful job going and talking to Roseanne. The chemistry. Well that's all credit to request from a metal bunk. He was a software engineer and a brilliant guy. Software engineering or business. What was the Tony Hawk did? Tony Hawk epic games and you know, he sold his share in that and just decided to debunk conspiracies and he's brilliant at you know, and he breaks it down so eloquently on the show. We brought them on the show to sort of establish the science behind contracts and chem trails.

Speaker 4:          00:59:52       So, so my, my, my point with the whole asking questions, things and, and, and the validity of saying that it goes a lot toward the, the idea of visit. Is it smart to debate questions of pseudoscience? I guess right now what's happening is Bill Nye is A. I'm not sure if it happened yet already, but bill Nye is going to the creation museum to debate creationists. I know. I heard about that. Yeah. Now there's that that triggers a lot of pro and con thought in the, in the science communication business because many of us, myself included, think that it does more harm than good because you're suggesting to anyone who might be on the fence, you're suggesting to them that there is a debatable question here. When you have something that is clearly an established fact backed up by all available evidence and something that's crazy and has no possible evidence for it.

Speaker 4:          01:00:45       We don't hold scientific debates about that. Um, we move forward with our lives and when you go out and you hold a debate, when you agree to have a debate, you're going to convince anyone who's on the fence. Oh, maybe there is a question here that needs to be looked at. And in fact, uh, I, I, I think it's arguable that you do more harm than good. And so by the same token, I say that it's really possible when you say, Hey, I'm just the guy asking questions about building seven or whatever the subject is, that you're potentially doing more harm than good by suggesting that there is a questionable subject here. Roswell, let's take for example. Hey, I'm just thinking. I asked him questions. Isn't it strange that there were three small bodies that needed coffins? Well, let's start with the, the one one example.

Speaker 4:          01:01:29       Um, you think that potentially addressing a reality, a reality in the way something looks, that that could be dangerous, that in somehow people could miss through that, misconstrue that for being support for a conspiracy theory. I think that when you take, when you ask questions and you make an argument that says, hey, shouldn't we ask questions about this? Which is the answer is usually yes. But when it's on a matter of basically settled science, I think you're doing more harm than good by suggesting, hey, shouldn't we question whether two plus two equals four? Isn't it okay to ask, does two plus two equals five? Well, you know that there's massive inconsistencies in the studies that were done about nine slash 11 that a disputed about like the free fall speed. I know there's a lot of anomalies that people will picked out, but I wouldn't say that there's any inconsistencies. The evidence

Speaker 2:          01:02:20       when we talking about technic testable evidence that you can hold in your hand. Well, what I would mean by inconsistencies is things that anomalies is a better word. Things that you don't usually find like buildings falling at free, fall speed and then saying that is one second less than free fall speed. All these things fuel the, the, the debate, all these things. Get people excited about it, but to deny that these things exist, I think is silly because then you fueled the conspiracy theories even more because you're denying something that seems obvious to the eye. The eye, the average person that looks at that building says yes, that does look like a controlled demolition. Does that mean it is? No, it doesn't, but to pretend that it doesn't look like that is ridiculous to about 10, that is not odd that it falls at free.

Speaker 2:          01:02:59       Fall speed. I'm not sure anyone is denying that. It looks like a. The part of it you can see in the video, it does. It looks exactly like a control. You criticized me for what you agree with that it looks like a controlled demolition discussing. You know, that's not what. That's not what I'm criticizing you for. I agree that it looks like a controlled demolition. That's not the question. The question is whether it should be brought up now. Well, I mean you're, you're, we're sticking on this one example of building seven. We haven't resolved it yet. It's a good example because it's an example that you use as an example of you thinking that if you listen to me just describe what I see with my eyes that it sounds to me like I'm supporting some sort of a conspiracy theory when I'm 100 percent not. Okay. Would you.

Speaker 2:          01:03:44       It seems like you have topics that are off limits and that like this discuss something like that. Even did it to look at the reality of the speed that it fell to Steven. Bring it up is off limits. Even if you say, I don't believe in the conspiracy, but isn't it crazy that building looks like a controlled. The only reason that this is a difficult example to talk about is because it's one that so ideologically charged, right as his bill Nye talking about creationism. There's, there's really, there's really nobody who's on the fence about that. You're either a creation story or not. I mean, there might be some people who are on the fence, but there's a lot on me. I don't quite buy it. Well, let's look at the numbers. The Gallup poll, the most recent Gallup poll on the age of the earth was more than 46 percent.

Speaker 2:          01:04:30       Tell me more than 46 percent. Think the earth is less than 10,000 years old. I don't want to know. It's shocking. Well, it's. We know exactly where it comes from. First of all, how many of those people have been exposed to actual science, actual research, actual data? Someone who's really cosmetic, like a neil degrasse Tyson, who could break down the what we know about science, what we've done, what great work has been shown that we can carbon date things we know about the date of stars. We can follow the radio waves in this, in that we can measure in space and prove that there was a big bang 14 billion years ago. All that stuff is so exciting that if it's done correctly by a guy like Neil Tyson, it can be unbelievably culturally, culturally valuable, but those 46 percent of the people that believed that the earth is 10,000 years old, I can almost guarantee that they

Speaker 1:          01:05:18       haven't had that in their life. They just haven't been exposed to a charismatic scientist or a documentary that was unbelievably compelling. That jived with their Christian ideology so much they could absorb it. You know, there had been brainwashed. They've been fucked over by their own culture. They've been fucked over by their community. They've been fucked over by these dummies that raised them and taught them this silly idea that so easily disproven that it makes them a joke to anybody. That's had any sort of formal education whatsoever, and it's almost half the population.

Speaker 4:          01:05:48       Let let me point out something that it kind of a surprising similarity between belief in creation as an belief in the Kennedy, the Kennedy assassination, there are, like we talked about, there are a dozen law. Well, there's hundreds, but let's say that there's a dozen different kennedy conspiracies that are mutually exclusive. Just for sake of argument, let's pretend it's a dozen. Okay. You've got about just as many theories of creation. Sure. That are completely incompatible, which is nothing existed until 6,000 years ago. Everything poof appeared with exactly the appearance of age you've got. The earth is actually old, but life is is a recent creation. You've got all the other animals are old and evolution happened in everything except humans, which were a special creation event. You've got humans didn't evolve the way science tells us, but then suddenly we were given souls on the Adam and eve day or you've got all of these holidays now that we found a columbus is an asshole.

Speaker 4:          01:06:52       Now you can eat. You can come up with science and and lot of people have they've. They've come up with quote unquote science to support each one of these different theories. Not really. No, no, no. What is in there? What qualifies in their mind as scientific support for. Okay, so exactly like the people who support all these different versions of the Kennedy conspiracy, even though all of their theories are mutually in mutually exclusive, completely incompatible. They all agree with. They all consider themselves to be on the same page in that they reject the quote unquote official.

Speaker 1:          01:07:27       I find that to be a disingenuous argument because the argument for the earth being billions of years old, the universe being billions of years old is unbelievably unfathomably. An overwhelming genius after genius has broken down all the various particles of the fucking universe and the dark matter in the skies and the fact that inside every black hole may ultimately be another universe with hundreds of billions of galaxies inside of it, with black holes in each one of them that the number of people that have worked on provable conclusions about the age of things using carbon dating or what does the other way, radiocarbon dating and what's the new one that they're doing? Well, there's all sorts of, but the sheer overwhelming numbers to ignore that because you read some stupid old book I think is way ridiculous than to look at a guy who was murdered and know that someone shot him and that it might've been this guy that this other gangster came and shot and killed, but we'll never know because he's dead. But so many other pieces. Vince Bugliosi could sit here and make exactly the same argument in reverse, but he's chasing ghosts. You're chasing ghosts. You can't go back to 1963. You know how you gonna prove what happened

Speaker 4:          01:08:39       back to 6,000 years ago. And so you were were you there and you see dinosaurs running around a billion years ago.

Speaker 1:          01:08:44       That's not. That's not compatible because you could take, you could take a piece of wood and you can carbon date that piece of wood and you find out what this word is, 5,000 years old. You can do that. That's done. That's a real thing when you're dealing with the Kennedy assassination is, yeah, you've got some stories and yeah, you've got some facts and yeah, you've got some circumstances, but putting it all together is a very complicated series of events that took place in order to kill that guy and take his body and fly it to Bethesda, Maryland and who gotten how to Jack Ruby. Get in there and who benefited from all this. There's a lot of variables and you are also exist, but hold on, but variables that don't exist when you're examining, say like the core of the earth when you're examining the birth and death of stars, hyper, Novas, all these things that we can absolutely prove are a part of our natural world

Speaker 4:          01:09:29       we live in. Okay, but again, you're talking down to you're, you're, you're, you're, you're ignoring the question of what constitutes evidence because there are people who will make a compelling speech about why carbon dating is invalid. Sure. Maybe the Lord has changed the route, the, the, the, the, the, the speed at which a elements decay over over the, over the centuries. Now that's something you can't argue with because it's, it's what we call a special pleading. It's, it's this, as in humans, we small humans are not able to understand this and that's an argument that can be used to defend just about any pseudoscience or just about any pseudo history. So I mean you can apply exactly the same thing. Alternate versions of the Kennedy history are always going to be just as valid as alternate versions of the age of the earth and devolution and it's, it's, they're made invalid in there.

Speaker 4:          01:10:24       They are presented as being valid using evidence that cannot be argued against because it's theoretical sort of here. Here's the problem with the government. The government has been proven time and time again to be full of shit. So when you look at official government stories and you say, well let's take this as our conclusion and now let's work backward from here and find out what, what took place. Well, we know that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone because the government says, we know that Jack Ruby was a bad guy and he was very patriotic and he was really sad and so that's why he did what he did and case closed. Wrap it up, tie boom. When you

Speaker 1:          01:10:59       and you look at all that, it doesn't stand up to scrutiny. It does, doesn't. It doesn't. If you're dealing with a liar, a liar told you this crazy story. Damn man. I was on your way over to your house, man. But a fucking asteroid came down and knocked my tire off and I need another tire side to wait in line and do what? I'm so sorry I'm late. You're like, that guy's a liar. He lies all the time. He probably lied about this too. Well, if you're dealing with something like the United States government that's shown itself over and over and over again to be full of shit, it'd be very convenient to tell the people what they want the people to think rather than what is actually the truth, and then he start citing instance after instance. It's not just a blind accusations, but instance after instance, no longer do I think that it is not likely, nor is it logical to assume that the, let's go official store, which is a douchey term. It's a very loaded term. The official story makes it question, but you to assume that the story that we had been told in the mainstream media and the news is correct. It doesn't make sense. Why would you assume it was correct, but you're talking to a liar.

Speaker 4:          01:11:54       But scientists have told us that carbon, that carbon dating works, you know, uh, but we're talking about it's a matter of faith in it. We have to have faith in the scientists to accept carbon.

Speaker 1:          01:12:04       Oh, certainly not. You read the science on it. You read how they come up with the conclusions. I'm an idiot, but I read about carbon dating when I was trying to figure out why they could figure out that dinosaurs existed 65 million years ago. I'm unbelievably terrified and fascinated by asteroidal impacts and it's one of my main obsessions when it comes to like late night freakouts watching the discovery channel and you know, watching, you know, the, the, just the idea that one day we could get hit by one of these 800 plus thousand near Earth objects that are fucking gigantic stones flying through the earth. I'm fascinated by that shit. So I got pretty deep into the whole idea of carbon dating and the whole idea, like how they figured it out and I've read a bunch of articles on it and I watched documentaries on it. It's pretty easy to figure out from an idiot's point of view, like how they're doing it. Like I don't understand the science behind it. I can't really replicate it, but I listened to them describe it and it clicks with me and it makes sense.

Speaker 4:          01:12:56       Okay. But I mean, so my argument is that

Speaker 4:          01:13:03       disagreeing with carbon, dating, disagreeing with the scientific view of the earth is very similar to disagreeing with kind of the standard model of history, standard monitor of the JFK assassination. As told I the US government. I hate to use the term official story because I don't care. I've never read called the ls. I've never read the Warren Commission report. I've never read the nine slash 11 commission report to be honest. I don't know what's in them, but I can tell you what happened to Kennedy and I can tell you what happened to what happened on nine slash 11 according to what I would call our standard model of history, which probably agrees and most respect with the quote unquote official story. The issue with the standard model of the history of those is disseminated by the US government. People find easy to distrust. No, it's not. It's not. No. When you were watching it on that morning when you had your tv on, you're watching the towers fall and you're. You've got broadcasters with the microphone. They were not being influenced by the government. They didn't have an earpiece in with someone from the CIA telling them what to say next. You were pretty much watching it happen through no government

Speaker 2:          01:14:12       filter. Oh right, but wait a minute, but when you're talking about the official story of it, it's not the news being told as the event goes down, it's the explanation of why the event took place after the fact that people disagree with. They don't. No one disagrees that the towers fell with that. Planes hit them. Sure they do. There's people who think the planes were holographs. Okay. You getting really crazy though. Hey, I mean there's. There's all of these different theories and while there's people that believe the earth is hollow, there's people that believe that life is, but a dream. Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily, hollow, earth stories are awesome. They're awesome. They're all awesome. I've, I've talked to those people. They were fucking crazy. Well, look, people are nuts. You know there there's people that walked down the street and talk to people that aren't there.

Speaker 2:          01:14:54       That doesn't mean that the government is correct about Kennedy. Doesn't mean that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone. It doesn't mean that there's no nothing other than the reason to conclude that a single bullet in info inflicted all that damage is nothing other than their need to tie up the fact that they'd committed to the idea of three bullets, that that would be the only thing that would be logical that this guy could get off. They. Nobody thought he could get off four bullets. That was just like, there's two crazy three. Maybe he could fucking boom, boom, boom, and get all three bullets in five seconds with a milk road car Canto Chicago. When we were talking about that before I was desperately on my ipad here. I was trying to look up because at the beginning of my episode I did a recreation of the time of the Pouch Pouch. And then it's a long hell, a long pause until the final shot pouch shows it's something like nine seconds or something.

Speaker 2:          01:15:45       And that's a long time. I believe that they're a little less than that. But, um, I thought it was five. But yeah, that's the space between the last two shots that the number of seconds that you're usually told is the space between the last one. Also, something against the conspiracy that I would like to point out that people keep pointing out was that the scope and that rifle was off. That was one of the things that people kept saying that the scope and that rife, it was a bad scope. As a someone who's fucked up their scope before you could just put a rifle down hard, you drop it and it falls in the scope, bounce off the ground that scopes off. So the chain of evidence between Lee Harvey on the idea that they found this scope and it was impossible for them to fight with his gun because the scope is off is preposterous because anybody could have dropped that gun after Oswald left it there and fucked up that scope.

Speaker 2:          01:16:28       So the fact that who knows how many days or hours or whatever, later they went to check that scope to see if it was cited in that stupid hunters have to cite their scopes and after every trip, every time you put your stuff in luggage packed in with all this like cushioning and everything that makes sure in hard cases you still have to recite your scope and you get to a range. You have to because to be ethical, to make sure that you hit the animal where you want to hit it because they go off, they bounce around, they move. Same issue with telescopes. The sites on those are very similar. So I mean that doesn't mean though that you know, the whole ball of wax, the whole government story is exactly what happened. We're chasing ghosts. Were talking about some shit from the sixties and trying to piece it together and say case closed I think is preposterous.

Speaker 2:          01:17:13       I think it's ridiculous. I do think it's fascinating and I do think that people can lose their mind and in and chasing it down and investigating it. And I certainly did myself back in Pennsylvania when I was working at that fucking club, reading that stupid book all day and then going on stage that night and just bombing. I mean I had two shows that night in the first show. I just ate a plate of shit. And then the second show I pulled it together and got back. But I was depressed. Why? I mean, what were you? Were you were your child or getting your material are always. Oh No, no, no. It's my mindset. I've had to really distinctive times where the things that I saw before I went on stage fucked me up. That was a big one. That was probably the first one. Might have been the second one.

Speaker 2:          01:17:53       It was all the same time. It was a slow learner. But the other one was I went with this guy named jb smooth, you know jb smoove funny. He's hilarious. And Jb and I were doing a college together in New Jersey and jb was, it was really hard to find. And Jb was, he was running late, so they had me go on first and I wasn't prepared because I was sitting in the little rec room with a TV on and the TV was showing this documentary on the Malibu fires. Uh, it was so fucking depressing. It was the early nineties and these people lost everything and this guy was crying. He was a fireman and he was crying and weeping. His house was still there, but it's neighbors had lost their houses and he was just crying and weeping. This girl was looking for her dog and they're like, all right Joe, I'm jb is still late.

Speaker 2:          01:18:41       So what we're gonna do is we're going to put you on and you do your sat and then he'll go on after you. I was like, oh no. So I went on stage thinking about this guy crying, not even for his own loss but for his neighbors. Last and that girl looking for a dog. And I just got so sad and I went on stage at a shit that just title, even Japan really messed me up for a few days. I was. So I'd been to Japan just a few years before and man just seeing, seeing all that destruction and you just know, you know, watching those rivers, Washington on the streets and everything, you know, it's full of people. And it was a, I was messed up for days. Yeah, it's horrible. So those comedy required. I mean, you know, people are paying to see you take them out of this reality and have them escape into some fun world.

Speaker 2:          01:19:28       I wasn't good at it, you know, it was only. I was only 20, maybe 23 or something at the time I just was clumsy. I didn't know what the fuck I was doing and the idea of reading this conspiracy book all day and freaking out. I also was bad at perspective. Putting things in portfolio. Listen, this, this took place in [inaudible] 63. Here we are and you know, 1990. Why am I thinking about this? You know, I didn't have that ability to switch gears. So interesting. Well I stand up. Comedy is, is one of the careers that I have the most respect for because you can't not be smart and get away with it. You've obviously never seen Brian onstage. He kills and he's not smart. You've got it. You've got to

Speaker 4:          01:20:07       be a great speaker. You've got to be good on your feet. I mean, I, I'm just impressed. It's not a good speaker. I barely can talk, talk. So he's got worms in his mouth. Okay. My, my theory is disproven. Well, he, um, he also has a cheat code. He's got the, the God code became famous and then he started doing comedy again. It's your prop comedy without a proper profit is his personality. Well, thank you. I mean, that's very nice of you to say. Um, it's a.

Speaker 2:          01:20:36       my friend Joey Diaz says it best. He says it's the hardest, easiest thing you'll ever do. When you're good at it and you get good at it and you stay at it and you develop momentum, then it's easy. But to get to that point, it's very hard. And that, that was my, my birth or my. I'm entering into the world of conspiracies and the fascination with them came from that, from that one book, 100 percent, no doubt about it. That I can trace it back to that one book that made me start questioning reality of what I'd been taught. Are there other roads you've gone down that, uh, that you've since turned away from the Moon landings? Most drastic, like again, I say for, you know, just as a caveat, I always wish the moon landing was fake and I would be much more happy if it turned out it was a giant hoax then if people went to the moon, why? Because I'm a silly bitch and because I like silly things and I love, I think it'd be a greater accomplishment for people to fake that we went to the moon. They would almost even be to go to the moon. I mean, that was what Neil said. Yeah. Yeah. Well that's also with the, you know, I mean, a lot of people that have argued against it have said, yeah, science even scientifically that it would be more impressive.

Speaker 4:          01:21:46       It would. And I think, uh, the, the, the point that, uh, the number of people who would be expected to keep a secret as well. Okay. This is something that, um, we have a road. We went down with the flight was flight 93 or flight 77 flight 93 was the one that got shot down over Pennsylvania 93. So I've got a friend who does not believe in any of the nine slash 11 conspiracies, except he believes that we did successfully shoot down that plane.

Speaker 2:          01:22:14       Well, I will tell you this without saying anyone's name or speaking any further that I know people that are in the military and I asked them, is it possible that in a situation where a plane was going to be flown into the Pentagon, that they would have fighter jets it out of Scott? Do you think that would be possible? And they said 100 percent. Yeah. One hundred percent possible.

Speaker 4:          01:22:36       Oh, we would do it. We had to. We had plans on the way to do it. Yeah. They didn't get there in time. Allegedly. I, I, I, I have, I have no problem with the fact that they were on the way to get it, but, but the thing is that that's another case where you got to look at the number of people involved because if a missile gets shot, a missile getting shot is a big deal because you've got all kinds of accounting that has to happen for that. Not, not only do you have the ground crew and everyone's supposed to spend this long just shakes it off. You've got civilian oversight for all the supplies that happen. Again, for a plane to shoot a missile that nobody knows about, that's again going to involve, you know, a pyramid of people, you know, 100 people at the base may be at a minimum, a thousand people in the civilian oversight contractors. It just goes on and on and on. The number of people that would have wished that I could agree with that I,

Speaker 1:          01:23:28       but I can't because of the fact that they have black funded projects because of the fact that they develop things in total complete secrecy in area 51 that involve billions and billions of dollars. That's where the technology came from. That's where you know many different advanced technologies have come from without any knowledge whatsoever by the American people. So to say that it would be hard to hide a missile, it would certainly be an issue. We'd certainly be an issue, but I don't think that a government that could make a fucking stealth bomber would have a hard time hiding a missile.

Speaker 4:          01:23:56       Well okay. But these planes did not come from area 51. They can totally open basis trail walk on and off of it day.

Speaker 1:          01:24:03       That's true. But if you can. Well people walk on and off of the area, 51 everyday too. They just come in by buses. They just come in on planes and buses from, from Vegas. But that doesn't necessarily mean that that's, that's what happened. But it does. The idea of saying this could never happen because you would have too many people not really think about all the shit that they have designed that no one knew they had until they had this. There's a lot of secrecy still in government when they do it right and they're really good at it. When it comes to national security, they can keep things take,

Speaker 4:          01:24:32       but. But also those things weren't all that remarkable. There was nothing. Nothing that ever happened at area 51 turned out to really be all that interesting. Blackbird. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:24:40       You don't think that that's remarkable. These unbelievable jets. You don't think that stealth technology is remarkable. The fact that they look like Ufo and they can hide from radar. God Damn. You're hard.

Speaker 4:          01:24:50       No, I go to google. Com. Google came from really area 51. Oh, you're joking. No, I mean there's. There's being. Well, I'm buying it and anyone can get started. I'm a big aerospace nut and I follow a lot of the aerospace reporting and anyone, anyone in that industry knows what goes on at area 51 because it's basically the. It's the national test facility is what it's actually called. They simply, that's where they're testing the next generation planes. I wouldn't be surprised to see what they're testing. They're now, uh, because we pretty much have a pretty good idea of what it looks like. And that's the, that was the case in the 19 sixties was the case in the 19 seventies. You've obviously never seen the interviews with Robert Lasar know our favorite guy. Oh my God. Yeah. You have. Oh, I know all about Bob. Hello? Sorry. Yeah, I, I, I did a whole episode on, on his thing as well. He's a fascinating cat because he seems so smart. And then you finally, he lied about his college education know.

Speaker 1:          01:25:46       Oh, I think you might be crazy.

Speaker 4:          01:25:49       Yeah. That, that, that was a, that was really quite a wonder. But anyone who is in the note was laughing at him from the beginning. Oh, really? Only fooled people in the Ufo community.

Speaker 1:          01:25:57       Well, that sounds like an ad hominem attack, sir. And that doesn't do very much to support your arguments. So

Speaker 2:          01:26:04       was terrible debating skill you have here, Brian Dunning. He was wrong because of who he is to the end. Um, nobody wants us to be real more than me, like nobody wants to dig for it to be real more than me. Now I'm silly. I'm a silly person. I'm a comedian, you know, I don't have any vested interest in keeping the status quo and standard operational procedure in place. I like it all falling apart. I would love it if a Ufo flood flow over the city and people started shitting their pants and throwing bed pans out the windows. I would love it. I told you what, when I first got here to the studio, I told you that bigfoot is something that I believed in until five years ago. Fairly recent. Well, not just that. You said you believe the Patterson Gimlin footage. Oh yeah. No, I, I always believed that the Patterson Gimlin footage, um, do I just call it pattern and Kim leadership.

Speaker 2:          01:26:54       I always believed that that looked incredibly good and I still do now. The people who say that's the worst fake I've ever seen. I think they're being disingenuous because I think it's a brilliant face. I think it looks great. You're hilarious. I know the whole history of the film and everything. Um, and Bob. Yeah. The whole thing with, you know, when was the film where, when was the film purchase? Was it developed? How did it get from A to b? And we know that pretty much everything he said about it was a lie and we pretty much have a good picture of the film's history and we know that it was faked. We also know that he was arrested for larceny, for writing a bad check. He was very camera that he used to film and he had been paid. He was on a hunt to make a big foot documentary for God's sake. Don't bring this up to bobcat. Goldthwait crazy. Crazy. We had on my show. I had um, uh, well, here's, here's the video. Let's watch the video real quick just so we can show how silly you are that you think that this looks real.

Speaker 2:          01:27:55       The stabilized version, because this one's horrible because this is how it was first released. It was first released in this sort of like weird, shaky, shaky version. Um, this is actually probably stabilized because it, I mean, I think that looks so stupid and fake. How can you say it looks fake because it's so bad quality. Exactly. If there was anything in there that gave it away, like a Zipper, it wouldn't be visible because of the low graininess the way he walks. He walks like a person. I mean, it doesn't mean that it's not a big giant person, but he walks like a person and I don't think when you watch an elephant walk, there's, there's a reality to the weight that they carry around and that thing is not walking with the reality of the weight of an 800 pound, 1000 pound animal. That thing is walking. Maybe he's, maybe he's five, six. Well, they decided they were going to measure off all the different trees in that area and figure out how tall he was. I didn't say I thought it looked like he was over six feet tall. I said it looked like a real animal to me. Well, it doesn't. To me it looks like a guy in a monkey suit. It looks stupid. I'm what I'm doing is I'm, I, I'm admitting where I have had, where susceptible

Speaker 4:          01:29:02       to, you know, I wanted big foot to be real.

Speaker 1:          01:29:04       I understand. And in, in finding yourself that you were indeed a silly bitch. Now what you're doing is you're bouncing the other way and going was, I'm sorry, excuse me at the time, and now you're, you're bouncing completely the other way and hardcore skeptic, a skeptic by, by, not by choice, but by default, instantly, automatically lean towards the skeptic. Shouldn't we all be? I think we should be very objective for sure, and I think it can be very confusing if you're not, you know, if you do go looking around for conspiracies, the, the better alternative is most certainly to be skeptical by default, but I also think that you, you miss a lot of shit. Like, okay, here's a perfect example and I use this one all the time. Unfortunately for people listening to podcasts. Do you believe that nine slash 11 happened? Do you believe that planes flew into buildings? Do you believe that happens? Yes. Then you believe in conspiracies? Yes. Yes, yes. They conspired to do that and they pulled it off. A bunch of people hijack planes simultaneously in different spots in the country. They got control of the planes, flew those planes into buildings. Causal buildings collapse. Thousands people died. It was a conspiracy. It was a successfully executed conspiracy and only one of many that we know of all throughout history. So if you automatically take the skeptic point of view, you miss out on the possibility of exposing something that is a true conspiracy because they do exist.

Speaker 4:          01:30:23       Well, when you say the skeptic point of view, what do you mean how I would say the null hypothesis, the null hypothesis is that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone. The null hypothesis is that probably nothing remarkable happened.

Speaker 4:          01:30:37       Well, why would you say that? Well, okay. Remarkable things happen all the time though. Why would. Why would that be a fault? Okay, you're what? What? What? What I mean in that case is take the. Take the guy for a different example of a shooting. Take the guy who shot all the people at the movie theater. The null hypothesis is that a guy shot all the movie people in the movie theater as was reported by everyone who was there, right? The null hypothesis and the Kennedy situation would be that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone as discovered by the cops who chased him down and tackled him and arrested him in the movie theater. The null hypothesis for nine slash 11 would be that what happened generally as well as we saw it on television and was reported by the people where there is what happened. That's that would be the null hypothesis and anything remarkable would be something that goes against what appears to have happened on that day. So I would say that the null hypothesis is going to generally be right most of the time until we've got some remarkable evidence to prove it wrong. How do

Speaker 1:          01:31:36       you factor in contradictory evidence from reputable online news sources? Like, like for example, like let's, uh, the NSA. It's perfect example before it was revealed by Edward Snowden that the NSA was indeed spying on all these different Americans and detailing records of your phone calls. And who was surprised by that? Very few people were, but the people were had argued

Speaker 2:          01:32:00       against it via millie and they had said, there's no way there would be such a huge conspiracy. You'd have to hide that from so many people. So many people would be in the know. There's no way that that could be possibly true. I heard that. I. I witnessed Alex Jones having that discussion with a person where Alex Jones, who predicted this shit a long time ago, almost a decade before it actually happened, I believe it was 2003 or four. Alex Jones was saying, if you don't think they're keeping detailed records of every phone call, you make everything you do, every email you send. He was on it way before and I thought it was crazy nutty conspiracy talk. Meanwhile, he was right. They really were. They really, really figured out how to do it. They developed this technology. They created this storage facility that they're in the middle of the building right now in Utah.

Speaker 2:          01:32:47       That's going to be this massive warehouse of data and information. That's a real conspiracy. That turned out to be true. I don't think that there was. Well, I can't say that Alex, you, I don't give him credit for predicting. How dare you. There's nothing. There's nothing that snowden revealed that I don't think was pretty much generally suspected. Anyway. We know that cell phone companies have always had all your cell phone records. Therefore the government has them. That's not surprising to me. Well, they could access that. Surprising that someone would be surprised by that. Really. That's funny because I thought it was a pretty big revelation cause for alarm. A lot of people were up in arms about it. It was a pretty big deal. I don't think they have. I think people have always been up in arms about it. There's been a lot of people saying, Hey, the self privacy, the cell phone company shouldn't have any way to track my calls or or to do.

Speaker 2:          01:33:34       But they can and they own their cell phone company so they can do whatever the heck they want and as long as those records exist, it's pretty naive to believe that nobody has access to them. Well, sure. That is not the issue. The issue is that they're doing it for every single American all the time. They constantly following you and constantly watching your emails and constantly that it's not a matter of looking at suspicious, suspicious people or people that have been accused of crimes. It's a matter of people that are just law abiding citizens that are taxpayers and doing nothing wrong, but yet they're being almost like held because they're checking all their information. It's like this thing that they hold over your head and the idea that this could be used to intimidate political opponents so this could be used to intimidate business rivals.

Speaker 2:          01:34:15       You know, that that was a huge conspiracy and I think to, to deny that that was pretty shocking to the American people when we found out that they not only did indeed have this power and capability, but they had been utilizing it for a long time. Some things only shocking if you didn't have enough information to be aware of that that was going on. Um, and I, I mean I come from the Silicon Valley background and with the formation of all the big, the big search engines and things like that, having worked at enormous ridiculously huge data centers and everything and having a general idea of how the technology works. I mean it's, it's, it's to me it's nothing, nothing in that is surprising that, that, that data is being collected on that large of a scale or that anyone would have access to it. Nothing. Nothing I've heard coming from snowden surprised me in any way and wouldn't surprise most of the people from a similar background as me I think.

Speaker 2:          01:35:15       I think for a lot of people is quite shocking. I'm sure it was. But, um, but I think if you, if you know anything about the way the technology works and about that, the whole data storage and collection industry, you know, the null hypothesis has got to be that hey, anyone who wants access to it has access to but in wasn't the no hypothesis when Obama gave that speech and said that we're not doing it and this is just metadata. And when didn't believe people believe that it wasn't that essentially what everyone was reporting in the news and everyone was saying, listen, this is much ado about nothing. This is just metadata. Don't worry. And then it turned out that that wasn't the case at all. Well, the null hypothesis also, I think that the government, the government maybe, maybe, uh, maybe a presidential press releases are not always exactly accurate to a federal truth.

Speaker 2:          01:36:03       How do we apply that to everything else? How do we apply that to the Kennedy assassination? And how mean the nutters hear this and they're going to apply it. Sorry for calling. You notice folks, but the nine slash 11 truther, how about that? There they apply that to nine slash 11. Truth there say this is you're contradicting yourself. The whole idea that what they're saying is, is not the null hypothesis or what do you mean will you said that the government tends to be a liar when it comes to press conferences. Oh, okay. Okay. I got you. And an official story. The official story is is a lie because it's the official story because it's coming from the government compared to the null hypothesis being that the government always lies about everything or a frequently is not completely truthful. Well, no, it wasn't a no hypothesis that the story that's being produced in the media is the actual story that whatever the, the, the conclusions that mainstream is accepted about Osama bin Ladin and these hijackers from Saudi Arabia and all these different things that factor into the events of nine slash 11 are in fact exactly how it went down when you in fact just said that when it comes to like the NSA and the Obama administration not being correct or being truthful about metadata and what was being collected that well, the United States government tends to lie well.

Speaker 2:          01:37:17       If they tend to lie, they tend to lie and if they tend to lie, why would you assume that there are other explanations for all the different things that have taken place for true at all? It wouldn't be the happy. It's just fascinating subject and obviously very complicated, but that's my point. That's the point. Yes, but, but also when you say the official story, when you're talking about what the government says, that's not necessarily the source of information that people are relying on. Nobody has read the nine slash 11 report. Nobody has read the Warren Commission report. You and I, we don't even know what the government's position is on those. We assume we do. We assume that it's whatever's in those reports, what people generally

Speaker 4:          01:37:56       believe about it, but that's not our source of information. We didn't go to the government for our information. I've. I don't think I've ever had a question about nine slash 11 that I've gone and googled a government website to find out what the, what, what should have happened, what I'm supposed to be

Speaker 1:          01:38:12       belief is. I don't think anything. There are government websites and spell out history. Is there a government website? It's history. I don't think that exists. I have no. It fucking crushed that thing.

Speaker 4:          01:38:20       The thing is you, you can't conflate the government's version of events with. That's why I like to use the term, the standard model. The standard model is what, you know, probably most historians, p, whatever, whatever the field is, whatever the scientists are, whatever the historians are, if it's a historical weather, what, what most lawyers think, if it's a legal question, I don't, I would call it the standard model. I would not use the term of the official story because that suggests government involvement, which is not not an authoritative source. The government, quote unquote, is not an authoritative source on anything. It's not where people get their nine slash 11 information. We get that from basically from historians, you know, for, from modern history. It's not the official source on how many neutrons are in a boron, Adam, you know, that's, we get that from the standard model of science. So, um, I, I don't think it's too much of a, I don't think it's hypocritical for me to say that I'm a boy. I'm twisting myself into knots here. I don't think it's hypocritical for me to say that when Obama says something that we shouldn't accept as the truth, um, that, that conflicts with the government's official position on nine slash 11 or snowden or what the end of the Kennedy assassination. I think what I'm saying makes sense.

Speaker 1:          01:39:39       Well, the, the issue with that is, of course the news outlets, especially in the Kennedy assassination, got all their information from the government. They got all the reports from spokespersons that were assigned this position to give this press conference and explained what the details are where the president was found. Bethesda, Maryland. What do you think? That guy got his talking points as he winging it, you know, they're not winging it. Those guys were told what to say and when to say it, and they were put on television because it was an easily controlled thing back then there. The reporters on the site. Sure. But what do they know whether they know, they know the president was dead and then they took the president's body away. Everything else is information from the government.

Speaker 4:          01:40:14       Well, I mean, what does that mean? Were they handed a press release that says White House at the top and Said told report this? Well, it depends on where were they getting their information.

Speaker 1:          01:40:22       Depends on. I mean there's many, many, many, many outlets. There's, there's different. You know, doctors had talked about it. There's different people who were on the news. There's Tom who is the guy who explained it on television for the first time, that classic speech that the president has been shot. Goddammit. Who was it that famous Daniel Grant? I don't believe it was Dan Rather. I think. I believe it was before his time. I want to say it doesn't. I don't know. It's pointless. The point is that where are they getting that information?

Speaker 4:          01:40:49       I'm asking. I don't see how the government fits in that loop. Will the government had body and they released

Speaker 1:          01:40:54       a press statement. That's fact. I mean they tell people that the president has been shot. The president's dead. This is what's going on and you know when the news outlets, whether it's local or national, ABC, NBC, whatever it is, they need to get the information from the official source. The official source would be someone who's in the government that has a press conference that explains the events as they took place.

Speaker 4:          01:41:14       Okay. So

Speaker 1:          01:41:15       what kind of spinning around in circles here that might be annoying for people? I was, yeah. I was basically going to circle where I would say the same thing. We agree on more than we disagree on and I think that what I'm trying to say is that there's weirdness to the world and that to automatically take the skeptical position is oftentimes just as silly as automatically taking the conspiratorial position. Okay. What do you mean

Speaker 4:          01:41:37       by the skeptical position? What do you mean when you say, uh, from, from, from you that I'm, I'm, I'm getting the message that you think I tend to take a silly position.

Speaker 1:          01:41:46       No, no, no. Skeptical that it is silly to take this. I don't want to be fooled. Position just as foolish as it is sometimes to take this blue double double that either when Phil crazy, just as silly as it is to automatically knee jerk, take the conspiratorial position when we know for a fact that certain conspiracies have not just been planned out, but had been executed, whether it's the Gulf of Tonkin that led us into Vietnam, whether it's operation northwoods, which was a planned attack on American civilians and American military that was signed by the Joint Chiefs of Staff. They were going to make a jetliner explode. They were going to arm Cuban friendlies and have them attack Guantanamo Bay. All of this to blame on the Cubans so that we could go to war with Cuba when you know that that kind of information exists and was real and it's provable and it's in the freedom of Information Act releases when you know about all that, that has to be factored into the, uh, the spectrum of possibilities. Okay? But you can't, you can't

Speaker 4:          01:42:41       use the fact that there have been real conspiracies and history. You can't use that to defend conspiracy theories because conspiracy theories as defined by the way you and I are discussing them, our future predictions, that conspiracy theory about nine slash 11 and having been an inside job, for example, predict that one day it will be discovered that the government orchestrated nine slash 11. It's A. It's a prediction of evidence that will someday have exist in the future and future predictions really have never come true. I, I, I say that there. I've said this in print many times, that there are no conspiracy theories that have ever come true. A conspiracy theory being something that has existed as a theory among conspiracy theorists unknown to the general public unknown. I'll dispute that right away.

Speaker 1:          01:43:33       That one. What about the LSD experiments that they did on civilians?

Speaker 4:          01:43:36       That was, that did not exist as a conspiracy theory until it was discovered.

Speaker 1:          01:43:40       Well, most certainly did it. It just existed in my high school. We talked about them doing lsd experiments on soldiers. It was an urban legend. It was a myth that they gave soldiers lsd and they, they, they drag

Speaker 2:          01:43:51       people to find out what the asset would do to them and it rotted their brain out. We'd hear all these stories. You could hear about it from people that were in the military. You're talking about Mk ultra. I'm not talking about Mk ultra. I'm talking about operation midnight climax where the CIA drugged up people that were in brothels in New York and San Francisco so that they can study the effects of Lsd on innocent civilians. I'm talking about here. We're talking about. So I think that was part of Mk ultra mean. There was, there was a lot of programs related to him. Basically the same operation, midnight, 19 fifties, forties, fifties. That's pretty early. Well, it was also the, the various things that they did to soldiers. Many of them documented to this day. There were all legends at one point in time. Those were all the, the mind control experiments that they did to Timothy.

Speaker 2:          01:44:37       Uh, what's his name? The unibomber. What's his name? Tim [inaudible]. Ted Kaczynski. Ted Kaczynski. He was a part of the, uh, the, the, the Harvard Lsd Studies, Ted Kaczynski. They fucking does that guy have with acid. I didn't know that as. He was very cool. There was a documentary on it, I think it was called the net and it was all about tracing back the roots of his insanity to these, these lsd experiments and that he may very well have signed up for something that fried is fucking brain. Okay. Let me, let me, let me ask her something right now. Ask. I'd like to ask your listeners of whom you have, how many don't know what we're talking about more than it definitely. I'd like to ask for all of all of Joe's listeners out there, if you have an example of a conspiracy theory that existed as a theory among conspiracy theorist before it became generally known by law enforcement, media, general, public, whatever.

Speaker 2:          01:45:33       Please let me know. Email me, Brian at [inaudible] dot com because I still maintain that there are none and I would love to be proven wrong about this and what the what Alex Jones said, isn't that a conspiracy theory that turned out to be true that the government is spying on your emails and listening to all your phone. That wasn't something that was known only to conspiracy theorists. That was something that's. I mean that's. That wasn't surprising. I, I can tell you because you were in the number of the people who were in that industry. That doesn't surprise me, but from someone like me, it was very surprising and for people that were listening to the official government story, it was absolutely contradicting. Okay, and the first time you learned about teen conspiracy theories, that turned out to be true. Let's read. Okay. Yeah. You're funny. I hear your voice is not objective, sir.

Speaker 2:          01:46:16       Cancer viruses into other vaccines. Atm Machines will someday use facial recognition technology. Yeah, but those are silly. Those are not conspiracy theories. That's just prognosticating. This is just crazy. And projecting. Well, there must be something in there. The US government and Monsanto are teaming up against opponents of agenda, kinetically modified food. It's not a conspiracy theory. It's not know kind of is that the US government and Monsanto are teaming up to make money pro wrestling's fake. Whoa. That's not real. Shut the fuck up, dude. Do. Don't break my break. My word world in half a scientists all over the world are creating extremely bizarre human animal hybrids. Okay. Is this true? Not long ago, Chinese scientists embedded genes for human milk proteins into a mouse genome and have since created herds of humanized milk producing. Well, that's just ignorance. They don't understand what what's going on there.

Speaker 2:          01:47:08       They. They're not making human hybrids. They're just utilizing genes for certain specific actions. Using a cell phone could cause cancer. Yeah. That's not been proven unless you talked to Sheryl Crow. Crow thinks she got a brain tumor from listening to the cell phone all the time. Fluoride is harmful for your teeth. Okay. Is that true? Department of Health and Human Services and environmental protection agency are proposing the change because of an increase in fluorosis, a condition that causes spotting and streaking of children's teeth. These are not conspiracy theories. This is a bad promotions of anti science. This is stupid prescription drugs kill large numbers of Americans to the fucking. Everything kills people, but if somebody, if someone out there does have a conspiracy theory that turned out to be true, please email me at [inaudible] dot com. I would. I would love to be able to report on it. One of those, one of the most, one of those common episode requests I get is for conspiracy theories that turned out to be true and I always answered that email with the same thing.

Speaker 2:          01:48:05       I said, great. Give me a suggestion. I've been looking for him. A lot of the times they confuse incompetence with conspiracy as well. Like here's one. The Federal Reserve is a perpetual debt machine that is designed to create inflation. Then it goes onto to show the US national debt has gotten more than 5,000 times larger than the value of the US dollar has fallen by more than 96 percent. I think that's more of an example of greed and incompetence and just fucking fools running things than it is a massive conspiracy to diminish the wealth of the United States. Just people are stealing from the system. That's all it is. They put cancer viruses in our vaccines because you know this Brian Denny, I know that they've got all kinds of different things in vaccines for different purposes and a lot of the times what the things that people report like there are a boarded fetal tissue in vaccines that's not completely untrue.

Speaker 2:          01:48:52       There are a certain certain certain lines that can only be grown in human tissue and so there's two particular lines of fetal tissue that have existed for boy, I think they're 40 or so years old now. These two particular lines and we grow the cultures in those in those tissues have a human tissue and then the. The. The cultures are removed from the tissue once in a while. Have spare cell or something will get stuck in and be included with the vaccine, but it's not harmful in any way and it's kind of misrepresents the white happens to say that, uh, we include human fetal tissue in vaccines. Someone sent me one that's legit. The Gulf of Tonkin incident never happened. That was a conspiracy theory long before it was ever proven. True. That's true.

Speaker 2:          01:49:41       I haven't done an episode on that. That's been a frequent request. I'll put that. I'll put that, bump that to the top of my. That's a real one, but I have a feeling that you're going to somehow or another shaded so that everything's gonna be okay. You're going to dance around it and make it seem like, listen, don't worry about me. What about the Gulf of Tonkin was known only to conspiracy theorists before law enforcement slash media slash whoever got ahold of it. That's a good question. Uh, well, that's, that's what we're looking for. How about the fact that it happened at all? That they, they actually did fake this incident that is established historical facts. But that's saying that a conspiracy happened. Sure. But that's not the same thing as a conspiracy theory happened, but no, it was serious theorist who were, who were shouting about it on the street corners before it was discovered by the general public or by law enforcement.

Speaker 2:          01:50:27       Really. Sure that that was something that people had talked about. I don't know. I mean obviously I'm too young to know, but the Gulf of Tonkin conspiracy. But I mean that's, that's the information I'm looking for. Yeah. I wouldn't have conspiracy theorists who, you know, from their New York apartment basements or wherever they were figured out these things. Yeah. I don't, I can't say before with people who should have known about them, found out about them. What about Watergate? Well, that's not really a conspiracy theory. What that is, is just standard operational procedure amongst crux. And then one guy got busted. There was, there was nobody knew that was Alex Jones was not on his radio shows screaming about what happened about Watergate. Well, he was a baby Bernstein and Woodward report. It wasn't even a baby. He wasn't even born then. Alex, he's younger than me. He looks like he's 60, but he's like, I think it's 40.

Speaker 2:          01:51:16       Really? Yeah. He's a young guy. When I first met him, I believe he was 28 is actually younger than me. Correctly. That's depressing. Yeah, he does look pretty bad. Doesn't he? Fucking burns at both ends. Alex. I'm sorry if you're listening. He says, sweetie, Jesus, he's a sweetie. But yeah, he's fucking. Look, if you, your whole day was doing gloom and new world order, he'd be shitting your pants too. Um, I don't know if we got anywhere with any of this talk, but we still have plenty of time. So, um, let's, let's, let's continue. I think I could shed light on a faulty thinking that I have had myself please. And I think, um, I think that confirmation bias and that you can go online and find French sites and all these different things that support your ideas and then not objectively look at it like completely objective.

Speaker 2:          01:52:00       We all get attached. We get our egos attached to statements and we get our egos attached to positions that we've taken. And I think that those, those, those egos and those statements and positions that we've taken oftentimes can be the enemy of objectivity. And I agree with you that there are most. I wouldn't say most things, but when you're looking at information online, what you should do is look at all the different arguments, pro and con, and then look where the intelligence is liquid. Look where the smart people are leaning. Look where the educated people are leaning liquid. The experts are leaning and try to figure it out and also know that no matter what there is in this world, if you haven't been there and you know you're, you're reading someone's take on it, there's going to be a bunch of different opposing

Speaker 1:          01:52:46       opinions that make no fucking sense. There's going to be some that are close. There's going to be the full range from from fucking whack a doodle. The planes were holograms. There was explosions that were looking at. This is not a civilian plane. You know, they, they, they, they took the people to the moon. There's this wackadoodle shit on, on every subject, everything that exists. And some of it you have to wonder, you know, we know that there's techniques and tactics of disinformation while they'll take a bunch of things that are absolutely true. Then attachment to one thing that's blatantly ridiculous, and that one thing sort of diminishes all the other things.

Speaker 4:          01:53:21       One thing that I always tell people and I always get criticized for it is if you have a question on any given matter, go to the experts in that, in that subject, if you want to know, you know how old the earth is, go to the people who actually work in that field. You're not always going to be right, but you're going to be right far more often than you're wrong. So no matter what the question is, what the pseudo sciences, for example, you know, a cancer bullshit, cancer remedies. If you want to know whether this works, go to go to the experts in cancer, go to the American cancer society, et Cetera, et cetera. You won't always be right, but you'll be right far more often

Speaker 1:          01:54:01       then you're wrong. We had a real problem with that on our show with um, Peter Duesberg. Peter Duesberg, who's a professor of biology at the University of California, Berkeley, uh, esteemed scholar who also believes that HIV doesn't cause aids and we had him on the podcast and it was unbelievably baffling and my statement was, it's very frustrating when you're too dumb to know who stupid, but it was listening to him and listening to the absolute outrage of all the actual scientists that work in the field of HIV research and how angry people were about it. And unfortunately I couldn't get anybody to debate him and I think that much like people are criticizing Bill Nye of visiting the creation museum is almost like people don't want to debate holocaust deniers. They did not want to debate this guy because somehow or another it gives his ideas.

Speaker 4:          01:54:49       Yeah. And I agree with that. I would say just let them hang out in the wind for anyone with any credibility to spend time on that. You're just, you're communicating to the general public that there's a question here that needs to be looked at and that's not right. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:55:04       It's baffling though. It's really confusing when you have this guy. It was just an incredibly intelligent man who's very well respected in educated and has done some amazing work on cancer research as well. So even since then, so it's, it's, it's baffling.

Speaker 4:          01:55:17       Okay. Let me, let me ask you something else. I want to kind of call you out a little bit on something else. Um, it's call you out of some new shit that people are doing in the last 10 years. No sense. Right on. It was. No, that's good. Before that, nobody ever did any conspiracy theorists believed that there would calling them. So. Okay. You had a guy on your show a couple of weeks ago. I tried to listen when I come on the show, I try to listen to some recent episodes. You had a guy on who was a doctor Dr something or rather Gordon. Mark. Mark Gordon Martin. Okay.

Speaker 4:          01:55:47       I, I listened to that episode. I, I turned it off in a rage at nine minutes because I couldn't take anymore. Okay. He came on and I believe you said you'd had them on several times before. Is that right? No, he's my friend. Okay. You know, the guy he came on and he starts promoting his miracle supplement that you take and you can drink as much alcohol as you want, not to get drunk. Well, he's talking about glutathione. It wasn't, wasn't saying it was me. He was selling a product that you can take it and you know he doesn't sell. It doesn't sell gludethyon. I might. He might beg to differ. That was the. That was the central thrust of the first nine minutes. The episode I listened, but what I want, what I want, I might be correct or incorrect. What I want to discuss with you is something you said to him, you said, you said that sounds too good to be true. [inaudible]. I wish I knew enough to call you out on your bullshit. Right.

Speaker 4:          01:56:36       You should have. You should have known enough to call them out on your bullshit. I didn't know he was gonna. Bring that up if you're going to. Well, I mean, okay. What? It wasn't like this. The topic of conversation, like when when I have some on the show, the the idea of having people in the show is just a conversation just with you. There's no. We didn't discuss much. We said, let's just have fun. Let's just talk. The same thing with mark. Mark is a friend of mine and he's an interesting guy and he can ramble on forever and relay all sorts of information. He's also an expert in traumatic brain injury, has helped a lot of soldiers, helped a lot of athletes, have a lot of football players, mixed martial arts fighters, boxers. He's. He's helped a lot of people understand the delicate balance of the of the human mind and here's the thing, is he.

Speaker 4:          01:57:12       He went on, he came on your show and told people that here's a supplement they can take and drink all they want and not get drunk. That gets people killed. People said that and and use, right though. No, he's not right. What happens when you take Gludethyon if you drunk? Does it have any effect? The body is a lot more complicated than that. It's a great example that I like to give of this is the idea of oxidation and antioxidants. Oxidation causes aging. It causes bad thing, so take an antioxidant and that sounds really simple, but it's far more complex than that and in fact it's so complicated. That statement doesn't even mean anything. It's one of these things. It's so wrong. It's not even wrong. As the saying goes, you can't just take something that's produced in your liver and counter effect counteract the effects of drinking alcohol. There is no direct line from anything you eat to any part of your body. If you take, if you're working out, if you're trying to get buff and you take a protein supplement, you thinking, hey, protein coming in, that's going to go to my muscles and help them get strong. That's something that is

Speaker 4:          01:58:18       incredibly wrong because it, but it sounds so simplistically true. It's not correct. That's not the way the body works. That's not the way the digestion system works. You cannot take something orally and have it go as a direct line to any given part of your body. That's not the way our digestive system and our blood works and when you say that there's a supplement that can prevent you from getting drunk, your, I'm sorry, your, your against all reasonably established science and you're trying to. You're trying to make a buck off of people potentially getting killed and I had a huge problem with that to the point that I had to turn the show off. I was just getting mad driving in my car and. Okay, keep going. Sorry. I think that that as someone with a huge audience as you have, I think you have more of a responsibility to make sure that people like that are called out on it. If you can. If you don't, if he surprises you with it, then say, okay, then I've got to get someone on next week. I got to go and get, you know, uh, Steven Novella or someone like that. Someone who is a promoter of science based medicine to counteract that because I think you could have left some of your listeners with the impression that hey, they can now buy something and drink all they want and then drive home safely. Um, okay. I'm, I'm looking online and immediately I find articles that discussed glutathione and it's,

Speaker 1:          01:59:37       it's role, vital role in alcohol, detoxification in the liver. It binds to the toxin, a civilized which s s, w a subtle d high, I don't know what else to tell to hide as. Thank you, which is a byproduct is a product of alcohol and is 10 to 30 times more toxic than the alcohol itself. Gludethyon then transfer. Say it again after what asked to tell, to hide, to hide into compounds that can be excreted. Alcohol therefore depletes our store of glutathione when depleted by excessive alcohol consumption, gludethyon becomes unavailable for normal and natural antioxidant effects leading to a host of health problems, and this article is actually saying that you should take glutathione when you drink. What you're talking about

Speaker 4:          02:00:20       about is reducing the effects of a hangover, getting over the hangover quickly. It does not underscored, does not prevent you from getting drunk or in any way mitigate the, the, the

Speaker 1:          02:00:31       intox alcohol effects of the also it doesn't diminish it or shrink it. Like as if he said he does, that's a believable one of his statements were, is that when you were drunk you could take this stuff and it would, uh, it would bring you back to baseline rather quick.

Speaker 4:          02:00:41       That is not true. You can reduce the effects of a hangover, but you cannot prevent yourself from getting.

Speaker 1:          02:00:46       Have you ever tried this? Do you know this for a fact? I've never tried his product. No, no, no. I mean it's not as product. Luda is available pretty much everywhere. I mean you could buy it in health food stores. You can buy it online.

Speaker 4:          02:00:56       I have never tried anyone's product that was intended as a

Speaker 1:          02:01:00       miracle drunk cure. But I mean it would make sense though that if alcohol and alcohol consumption and the, the, the reaction that has in the body, it's a chemical reaction that there could be possibly something that could counterbalance it or swing it in one way or another. Just like many other chemical reactions and symbiotic reactions that we have to things inside the body. Now when you read something about this, it seems like what you're, your dispute is that he said that it could diminish the effects of alcohol, like while you're drunk and you're saying that's not true. It just helps with the hangover. Yes. If it helps with a hangover, it's still really potent and pretty interesting. Um, I would like to do a test on it. I would like to see two people's blood alcohol levels measured. I think if you don't do that test. Yeah, you're, you fucking saying something kind of irresponsible. Which he did. I don't know if that test has been done though. Do you?

Speaker 4:          02:01:49       I have not searched the literature for what if it has been done and he's right then that would have. That would have been all over the literature. What is someone who feels follows the literature fairly closely? I can tell you that it has not been all over the literature that you can now drink and not get drunk. Well, I mean maybe he was exaggerating. I think he was exaggerating because he was selling a product. That's what it was

Speaker 1:          02:02:11       because he doesn't have a store. He doesn't have anything. I, he's not. When you say selling a product, whereas he selling out of. He doesn't have a store.

Speaker 4:          02:02:18       I don't really look, this was the nine minutes of his episode. He was talking about what he sells. If I'm wrong about that, then I'm damn wrong about it. And I'm surprised. This is another thing is that is a thing that's talking about a saving you from being too drunk because of taking glutathione before you drink. Where are you seeing it?

Speaker 1:          02:02:36       Uh, some fucking journal. There's, there's a, there's a long look. It's impossible to have a conversation and Google things. That's true. But, uh, it's also one, uh, there's a, a scientific article on reddit about large amounts of glutathione, uh, have the potential to sober people up in a very short time that we're researching a chemical drug. This is. Listen, man, there's not, he's not the only one that's talking about this. This is being discussed in many different forms. I don't know if he's right or wrong, but I don't think you do either. I would like to have him on with someone who disputes it and find out, but that's what I would recommend. He's a very smart guy and he wasn't saying that many outlandish things where I'd have to pull them down like the towers were destroyed by Tesla technology. That's not the same doctor.

Speaker 1:          02:03:24       Yeah, he's a pretty reasonable guy. He's a little bit out there. You know? He's kind of Wacky, but literacy out there. Oh, he's out there on. A good thing to say is out there. I don't know. I'd have to listen to her to go over. I liked the guy a lot. I'm very biased when it comes to him. He's a fun guy and he's very, very smart, but I'm looking at more than one thing that's showing that you could advance your sobriety, but you could sober up quicker by taking glutathione. I don't know if they're right or he's right or you're right, but I don't know. I don't know that you should be saying that. If you're not a doctor, what if it turns out? That is true.

Speaker 4:          02:03:59       I'm, I'm not a doctor, but I'm, I'm a science writer and I, I do google. I do follow this stuff. I've written on Google. I did an episode. Uh Oh, probably three, four months ago on a hangover. What exactly is the cause of a hangover? What's, what's the nature of the toxicity? He could use that information when it's a really complicated subject. It's an immunosuppressant. The dehydration. There's a lot of factors, right? Yeah. And it basically comes down to a, it's a depletion of glutathione in your body. Can't keep up with it. Sounds like Dr Gordon's, right? No, it's not as simple as that. That's the thing is it's easy to sell products by giving

Speaker 2:          02:04:38       an oversimplified description. I'm telling you though, you like, you're, you're pinning it on this guy. He doesn't have a store. Like you're saying, he's selling products. He's not, he's not selling anything. He, he was certainly talking about a product that's available. Not his, but he was, he was talking to me about it even before the podcast that he takes it. Um, I know, uh, Dave asprey from bulletproof exec. He takes a glutathione but he never brought up anything about it doing anything for, uh, for alcohol. Okay. Well, I, I would just like to leave you with, with the, my opinion that sense listeners got the impression that here's something that they can take and drink. All they want, not get drunk is potentially lethal advice. Yes. Who else got that information? Who me. I don't know if it's right either me and the listeners got fed some information that we don't know what's right.

Speaker 2:          02:05:26       I don't have any obligation other than to talk to people. My obligation is to ask questions if I'm curious, but in broadcasting this things, I make the, the, the very clear distinction that I'm not an expert. I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about when I'm talking about things like health and medicine and, but I'm fascinating. So if I'm talking to someone and they're an expert and they bring up something that I didn't prepare for, I'm going to ask him questions about it. And you know, I will say I wish I knew if you're full of shit, but that's about as good as I could do. The reason I had the reason I initially did this episode, excuse me five years ago, about celebrities who promote harmful pseudoscience is because when you have a large audience, I believe you do have an obligation to not give harmful information.

Speaker 2:          02:06:10       But I'm not giving it. I don't think for a minute that you've ever knowingly given any harmful information. I'm not accusing you of anything at all. But if it has been given by one of your guests and you are in the position of having to say, that sounds too good to be true. I wish I was. I wish I knew enough to call you out on your bullshit. Um, it seems to me like a reasonable step to follow that up with would have been to find out with get somebody on who can, who can, uh, who can address the other side of that question. Perhaps I can turn this around on you and say it would be so easy for. You have to research all those different things on that list that you accused me of many of them, which are not true at all and never have been true, but yet you printed them.

Speaker 2:          02:06:52       I did. So why did you do that? If you're a man of science information, would you possibly have had? Because I was using the Internet in 2008 and I look, look every, every, every, probably three, four months or so. I do an episode that is nothing but corrections, corrections of things I've been wrong about in the past. I think that's a great plan. I think it's great that I do that. I want to continue doing it. I will need more things to be wrong about so I can produce. Those episodes were often, but what you vote is very specific and what I want and what I came here today to do was to find out which of those are wrong and so that I will correct them. Yeah, but even this one thing you just said he wasn't selling it, but you got that wrong, but you're saying that he was selling. That wasn't on my show. I was listening to this show it wrong and you're saying it's

Speaker 4:          02:07:36       true and so now you're sending it out to the road that this guy sells a product. He doesn't. You're doing the exact same thing that you're blaming joe for. No, I'm not. I, I. You are though. You're saying this guy sells something when he doesn't. Yeah. You said that's hardly the salient point. The salient point is that information is being given that could potentially kill people. Right, but your information

Speaker 1:          02:08:00       as a medical expert, which he is under the guise of selling a product which is erroneous.

Speaker 4:          02:08:05       Okay, but I've. I've also said that I don't know whether it's his store, someone else's store, but it's a product that he's talking about that's the salient point. Whether it's his store, someone else's store doesn't really make a lick of difference compared to the fact that it's potentially

Speaker 1:          02:08:18       saying that he doesn't believe in it or that if he believes in it he's wrong and when he's saying is that he uses it, he doesn't sell it. And you're saying that he's saying that because he sells it. That was very specific. You had taken this very cynical approach to why he's disseminating this information. Fair enough, and, and I'm, I'm right now if I said that I was wrong on this, sweetie, you,

Speaker 4:          02:08:37       and that's to say that these aren't dumb people. They can't realize that they're drunk and they're taking a pill and they're going to go, well, I said, I said to him why I was.

Speaker 1:          02:08:45       That sounds like horse shit. You did. You did, but I don't know. I mean, he's a fucking smart guy. Like I, I know for a fact that that guy has helped a lot of people with traumatic brain injury. That's a different subject, but he's a doctor. He's a legit scientist and a doctor. I mean he's a really brilliant guy. So when he talks to me about the issues with a pituitary gland and impacts and his expertise on the human mind, that relates to me that he has a very vast understanding of the human body itself. When he tells me something like this and then I started reading that, there's more than one different article that sort of confirms what he's saying. I don't know if you're right. You might've gotten harsh on my friend Dr Gordon for no reason, I think. I think it's a very good reason.

Speaker 1:          02:09:25       I. If if he's giving, he's giving advice that's potentially killing people. I think that's a very good reason to err on the side of this information should be. Should be checked. That's true, but if you're so dumb that you're just just pound in alcohol and trusting the glutathione is going to do it, it's going to kill you. That's a Darwin award winner. If you're using spotify on to fucking know he's not saying drink all you want and you're going to be fine. I mean, he never said that. He never said there's no risk involved. What he was saying is it can help you get sober quicker. I don't know if he's right, but I don't think you do either. That's not what I heard. What you. What did you hear? I heard him say you can drink and not get drunk. We can listen to it on the Internet.

Speaker 1:          02:10:08       See if you could pull it up. So you give pull. If there's a very small sample that we could find. Yeah, I think we're kind of splitting hairs here. I could see why you'd be upset and I could see why you would think that I have the responsibility to call someone out. I would have to be the expert on a million different things and then I would have to have people on and have people counteract them and have people go back and forth and debates and that's all well and good in the real world. If you can organize those debates and if you get those people together, but for the most part I'm lucky to get someone to sit down once. I'm lucky to get someone who can fit into a times that I have and have them on the show and I just want to have a conversation with them.

Speaker 1:          02:10:46       I didn't have any idea that God was going to bring up glutathione. In fact, we wanted to highlight his work on traumatic brain injury because there's a big issue with mixed martial arts these days and the big issue is there's twofold. One traumatic brain injury and to the depletion of testosterone because of traumatic brain injury. It's been shown in people that have come back from war and suffered a head injuries and it's been shown from boxers and people that have sustained long term even subconcussive impacts to the head that the pituitary gland gets fucked up and he's trying to sort of spread this information and keep fighters from taking testosterone to counteract that and then competing to and continuing to compete, continuing to damage the brain. And it's an issue in mixed martial arts and it's one of the reasons why I had him on because he's a, he's a brilliant guy.

Speaker 1:          02:11:37       And um, he is very troubled by this idea that we're going to put a bandaid on traumatic brain injury by giving these guys testosterone use exemptions. He thinks it's wrong. He thinks if your body is producing less testosterone because of impacts, you shouldn't give it testosterone and continue receiving impacts. That was the whole premise for him coming on the show in the first place. So for me, I felt like I, um, he's the smartest person I know in regards to this particular subject. So I felt it was kind of important to discuss it with them. I have no idea that's glutathione shit was going to come up with, but here's what he said. We're going to pick up after you drink and you take them.

Speaker 5:          02:12:12       What is the, what is it? Unbelievable gludethyon pull that thing closer to your face so people hear you better. Glutathione, glutathione and that. That helps your liver when you drink alcohol. Well, it helps you with just about anything that delivers responsible for I'm digesting or metabolizing. As you metabolize certain drugs, chemicals and so forth. The liver uses up its ability to continue the process so it spills over into the blood and that's how you get a, you know, drunk because your liver can only deal with a certain amount, so if you replenish or replace the glutathione in the liver, you get an incredible benefits of it. Not only does it help with metabolism, but it's an incredible antioxidant for the brain and for the eyes and for the heart. What is it made out of a. it's three amino acids that are together. It's in our body, but we don't have enough of it to really generate the metabolism that we needed for drinking and where do they get that?

Speaker 5:          02:13:08       Where do they get glutathione, because I know Dave asprey's really into that stuff too. Version of it's manufactured, but how do they make it? What is a three amino acids that they put together and the products that we interact with? Our HRA, it's a delivery technology. We're wrap the vitamins or you wrap the supplement in a what's called a, which is like a cell wall, so from lecithin is from soy and it protects whatever it is that you're ingesting. A lot of the things that you take, like I think I shared with you, if you take a thousand milligrams of vitamin C by mouth, you only absorb 19 percent. The rest of it is destroyed by the acid in the stomach, but if you wrap it in this protection called the light bulbs home, you'll be able to absorb 93 percent. So taking something like Glutathione, which normally when you take it in in its natural form, it's destroyed.

Speaker 5:          02:14:02       Most of it is destroyed and then absorbed, then remanufactured in the blood, but if you wrap it in this protective outer coating, a Lyposomal, you can absorb it more readily and their effects are unbelievably positive. For instance, a gentleman who went out drinking three high balls and five shots of Tequila went home and subsequently was very dizzy, nauseous. He forgot that I gave them a sample of a this glutathione and he's used four puffs under the tongue, held it for 30 seconds, and then 30 minutes later, clear Isabelle woke up the next day, went out partying again. Couldn't get drunk. Wow. That sounds like nonsense. It isn't.

Speaker 2:          02:14:39       So I was smart enough to call you on your bullshit. Talk to my office, Aaron. Okay. Everything sounds crazy. Maybe that guy will cut her off right there. Maybe when I was actually at the beginning of the podcast, I remember that was about where I got mad and that was right in. Um, I don't buy the. He says he couldn't get drunk the next day. That's very anecdotal though. And what he was saying was just hard science. What a good doctor is not going to go and tell people anecdotes like you can take this product and not get drunk. I agree, and maybe he was nervous being on a podcast. You probably shouldn't have said it. No Man, a million people. Plus they're going to listen to it. However, what he said was all hard science. What he said was, okay, here are the things he said that led me to believe that it was his product at least obviously here where you would watch it.

Speaker 2:          02:15:22       Again, it wasn't as product. He wasn't selling. He said, he said, I gave him the supplement and you said, here's the delivery thing that we're working on, so maybe I misinterpreted that. Let me tell you something about this guy. He's a very generous guy and he gives people the vitamins all the time. He's like, here, try this out. This has been taken. This is an incredible amino acid. It's Baba Baba grapeseed and he's just a. He gives things out to people. Okay, here's the he, he. He said, it has all of these amazing effects in your heart, your brain, your eyes, antioxidants, and he's using language like extraordinary and amazing and in my experience, in my experience, dealing with many quacks of many different duck species. If it looks on quacks like when it's usually a quack and he was using very quack like language and making very quick points. I don't know anybody accused, you could accuse him of hyperbole, but what he's saying is essentially hard science about the Lyposomal, the digesting of nutrients using the lyposomal method as opposed to just normally being broken down by stomach acids. All the things he's saying. It's not that ridiculous. Yeah, I mean, when you. If you usually take something, if I. If you take some kind of an enzyme or something in your mouth,

Speaker 1:          02:16:30       your saliva is going to start breaking it down into their constituent amino acids right away and you're right. It's what he said was right. It's not going to get used as glutathione in your body. Those amino acids are going to go their separate ways and become used for whatever else your body actually is looking for. At the time, I don't know about his particular delivery method that he's talking about, but when he says it's not his guaranteed, I don't know about this stuff, the particular delivery method he's talking about, but when he says, you can take a thousand milligrams of vitamin C and your body's going to absorb 93 percent of it, that's in my experience medically nonsensical and your body doesn't need that much. Will your body doesn't use that 93 percent of what though? What are the vitamin C you took in your thousand, but what if it's a small amount?

Speaker 1:          02:17:14       If he's saying that your body absorbs 93 percent of vitamin C's, not saying that you need a thousand milligrams in your body absorbs 93 percent. What he's saying that if you deliver it in a lyposomal form, you get a 93 percent bioavailability. He's not giving a specific number that you should take. He was saying that if you take vitamin C, most of it gets destroyed unless you use it Lyposomal, which I think is correct, but your body doesn't have any use for 93 percent of a thousand milligrams of vitamin C. He didn't say that. He didn't say you need a thousand milligrams and then 93 percent of it is absorbed. What he said is if you take it light but Somali, it's a higher rate of vial availability and it's up to 93 percent. He didn't say you have to take 100 milligrams. Do you think she was implying that it's better to have a dosage?

Speaker 1:          02:17:57       She was trying to say that it's better to have lyposomal vitamin C because it's more bioavailable. That's all hard sciences. I was a better. If it's going to give you more than you can use, how is it better? No, you're adding that. He didn't say that you have to have a thousand milligrams. What he said is that if you take it, 19 percent is going to get absorbed. You'd take it through the traditional method. If you take it light, so molly, then you get 93 percent absorption. He didn't give you a dose it. He wasn't saying he wasn't suggesting or implying that that's them to be wrong. Siren. This is not. This is not cool. Look, I'm just. I'm just saying it looks and quacks like a duck generous, which you're saying is disingenuous because that's not what he's saying. What what he's saying there was that the bioavailability of lipel symbol nutrients is better and that's true.

Speaker 1:          02:18:36       You're saying that he's saying a thousand milligrams in Europe. Point of contention is you don't need a thousand milligrams. He never said you need a thousand milligrams of Lyposomal vitamin C. all he said was that when you take vitamin C, lipel stumbling. Your body absorbs it better. Whether it says what it's really 93 percent. Okay. Yeah, it is. Look at this. Fuck they're saying on a live and labs lyposomal science. I'm saying a bioavailability, a vial of bioavailability of 98 percent. There's another one that says over 90 percent. So what he's saying is true. What he's saying is fact, and you're. You're shitting on it because you don't want them to be right about what I think you're correct about is this, this idea, this anecdotal story of a guy, you know, taking this stuff, feeling better 30 minutes later and then the next day couldn't get drunk. That sounds like bullshit to me too, but all that other stuff that he said, that's all science.

Speaker 4:          02:19:29       I'm shitting on anyone who is selling snake oil. Basically come on pitching snake oil to be bought or suggesting that that buying supplements and things that you don't need is a good way to spend your money.

Speaker 1:          02:19:41       But wait a minute. If someone likes to drink isn't a smart thing to take glutathione after you drank to to shorten your hangover. Isn't that effective?

Speaker 4:          02:19:49       I would have to look at the research before I would tell you

Speaker 1:          02:19:51       you said it. You said it before you said that it. It aids in reducing hangover. Okay. Yeah. So it. So why wouldn't you take that? You're saying that he's selling something that you don't need. It's not as simple as that, but wait a minute. Wait. None of these issues are as simple as saying it is, but uh, you're, you're saying that you take glutathione when you're hung over and it reduces the length of your hangover. He saying, take glutathione. You're saying saying to take glutathione is unnecessarily. You're saying that you don't need it when needed. You don't need nutrients. You could live on cheeseburgers and get to be fucking 60 years old. Just eating shitty food. That doesn't mean it doesn't mean your life isn't enhanced by raw vegetables and nutrients and having a balanced diet. You, you saying that you don't need glutathione is pretty ridiculous.

Speaker 4:          02:20:38       If you can get glutathione into your liver, you will, your hangover will be reduced. So why don't you either. This method of taking a supplement will get glutathione into your liver is something that I don't know and I would have to look at the research before I would tell you that you're already in. I will tell you being wrong, I'm, I'm accusing him being wrong, that you can take a product and not get drunk after trying, trying to get drunk and not able to get drunk. I'm saying that that's wrong and it borders on being really, really unethical. He wrong.

Speaker 1:          02:21:08       We agree on that, but you've set up all sorts of Straw man arguments for why he did it and what he's doing and what he's saying and the bioavailability of vitamin C in those all fall under the fall apart under scrutiny, so let's have him come on and correct it this time to come on and debate you. He doesn't know you wouldn't get it. I'd get I'd get someone who knows the business. He said, look, he's a silly guy and sometimes he might speak in hyperbole, but what he's saying that you corrected your wrong about about bio availability. You attributed him to this erroneous number of a thousand milligrams. He didn't say that. He did not. Did you want to play? Let's play it again. Let's play again. The light bulbs, Samo, we don't need to play.

Speaker 4:          02:21:46       If you take a thousand milligrams of vitamin C and ut and a and you take it Lyposomal, you'll absorb 93

Speaker 1:          02:21:51       and it's not what he said. What he said was, if you take a thousand milligrams of vitamin C, your body only absorbs 19 percent, and he said, if you take vitamin C, Lipids Soumala, your body absorbs a giant amount of it. He said 19 percent and 93 percent. That's what he said. He didn't say, you know, you're saying you don't need that much vitamin C and that's why he's wrong, but high levels of vitamin C, that's debatable as well because high levels of vitamin C have been shown to be potent antioxidants that could prevent against certain types of diseases. A lot of people think it boosts your immune system. It helps fight off various pathogens. There's a lot of research hard data that shows that high levels of vitamin C is probably pretty good for you.

Speaker 4:          02:22:29       In my research, all of that has turned out to be nonsense. Your research on vitamin C is extensive? Yes. What's your research on vitamin C? God, I can look up my episode for you. I mean, it was a few years ago. We talked mostly about it. It was invented by a course linus pauling, who by this time in his career was something of a crank and came up with this notion that vitamin, Mega dosing would cure cancer, and he wrote the book called can't remember the name of his book, but that's essentially what started off the whole vitamin and supplement movement that still exists very strongly to this day. And what we have found by testing is that vitamin C does not significantly affect cancer. The length or duration or severity of a cold, etc. Etc. All of thEse things that we take it for, this caused a great rift between him and science and he spent most of the rest of his career, which was fairly short because he was quite elderly by that time. Uh, basically widening that rift and debating with, uh, with the medical profession and trying to defend his vitamin mega dosing idea. And what you'll find now, I mean this is pretty much everywhere in recent scientific literature, is the idea that vitamins really don't do anything for you because very few people have vitamin deficiencies and you still have health

Speaker 1:          02:23:48       list evidence demonstrating that vitamin c's, anticancer properties that high levels of vitamin c kills cancer. This is the national institute of health

Speaker 4:          02:23:57       and read the whole thing. I bet you anything that's talked about in vitro, in vitro or ivy you mean? You mean in vitro means if you put something in a petri dish and you put some cells in there and you pour something in it and it kills the cells that's in vitro. It's got very little to do with institute, which has means actually doing some tests in your body. So

Speaker 1:          02:24:17       the ivc, is that what they would call it? High dose ivc. Is that in vitro?

Speaker 4:          02:24:22       No, it would just be written out in vitro.

Speaker 1:          02:24:25       No, it's not saying that saying high dose ivc, a nontoxic chemotherapeutic agent that can be given in conjunction with conventional cancer treatments based on the work of several vitamin c pioneers. Before Dr. Jordan was able to prove that vitamin c was selectively toxic to cancer cells, if given intravenously. This research has recently reproduced and published by Dr. Mark Levine at the national institute of health. So meaning that it's the bioavailability is at its highest because it's intravenously introduced, meaning that what he was saying about the bioavailability, bioavailability because of lyposomal science, that would also be a higher absorption rate than eating it normally. So what he's saying is that what this article is saying is that there's benefit to taking high level of vitamin c.

Speaker 4:          02:25:11       I look, I don't have that article in front of me, but I will tell you in my experience that you can find an article making any point you want to very easily because about anything and, but does having, having researched this extensively and being very familiar

Speaker 1:          02:25:24       with, um, with science writers and science journalist in virtually every field, I can tell you that the current thinking is not that vitamin c has any beneficial effect on cancer. So you are no idea what this article is that you're looking at. I think it's complicated, man. You know, I think there's a, there's a lot of work being done that shows that there are benefits to taking in nutrients. There's a, there was a study transfer, the different various vitamins supplementing various vitamins. Um, there was uh, an interesting one that I'm looking at right now that we're talking about the, um, the prevention of shit. I'll try to find it, but I didn't see know those, um, here's one, uh, infectious illness prevention and this is a, a ncbi website. It's a national health institute, national institute for health, mood and stress cognition, and they've shown that it's actually that you could take high level that vitamin c and different antioxidants and multivitamins had been shown to decrease juvenile delinquency.

Speaker 1:          02:26:32       Like I said, you can find an article. what did you search for it, by the way? What was your search term? I don't remember. Benefits of vitamin c suck dick vitamins through that all together. you know, man, I, I see where you're going with all this and I see your point of view. You're a no nonsense guy and I, I agree with you for the most part. And I think that, uh, you know, in the case of Dr. Gordon and his description was probably rather unfortunate that he decided to give that anecdotal story along with this very interesting aspect of researching nutrition fair assessment. I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll agree with that. It's not a, it would never make me angry enough to shut it off and yell at them and your descriptions of even what he said and the event is off, you know, and I think that's from this hard stance, no nonsense approach you have.

Speaker 1:          02:27:18       And I don't blame you if you look in the world that we live in, it's filled with bullshit and a no nonsense guy gets fucking tired of dealing with bullshit at a, on a regular basis all day long. And I think you're a bit knee jerk and your reactions, their fellow. Okay, they, you're certainly not the only person to have said that. Well, you used to believe that big foot five years ago may lighten up. Here's the thing with the thing, the best definition of skepticism is the intersection of science education and consumer protection. If people are have better science literacy, they are less likely to take advantage of products that are worthless. Okay. That is a way of looking at it that it aids in consumer protection. That is my motivation. I believe that information, it aids in consumer protection, all the information, the eventually.

Speaker 1:          02:28:09       Right now we're dealing with this rudimentary sort of a way of assimilating it and distributing it and I think ultimately all the bullshit that we're dealing with in this world will stop to to be valid. I think what we're dealing with right now is like we google things when they. When we have an answer about something and then one day we're going to have an unstoppable like base of knowledge and I think that it's probably sooner than later, but right now when we do have this, these discrepancies and these, these issues, any gray area, anywhere that you're wrong and you take this hard stance, this hard no nonsense stance, it actually does more harm than it does good because if we could show that you're wrong than even though it's not, your message is correct. I agree with your message has set it at the time and he's my friend.

Speaker 1:          02:28:58       I wish I could call you out on your bullshit. I wished I could because I know him and he's kind of crazy, but you saying all those things diminishes your initial point because your initial point was very valid. He was being irresponsible in saying that you could take this stuff and not get drunk. It seems ridiculous. He shouldn't have told that anecdote story, but you shouldn't have insisted that he had said a thousand milligrams and that is 93 percent bioavailability and then you're trying to find some way that he's wrong. So you're going, well, why do you need that much? And he didn't say that. Well, he's trying to sell this stuff. He's not selling shit. He doesn't have a store. He's not selling a god damn thing. Okay, we'll agree to disagree on whether he said that, oh, we played, we played it, we played it back and I heard. But then again, you hear it again, his thousand milligrams and you've given me some great advice as far as a health and fitness and exercise and all sorts of kudos. Gouda. Had a couple of minutes. The whole thing. Every conversation though. I know I forgot something. I know it's good ahead. Tell them about him and shit helps your liver after you drank and you this good head. What is this? What is it? Unbelievable. Gludethyon no, but he goes go a little bit of nuance specifically

Speaker 5:          02:30:04       gludethyon and that would. And the products that we interact with our, a delivery technology, we're um, you wrap the vitamins or you wrap the supplement in a what's called a liposome, which is like a cell wall. So from lecithin is from soy and it protects whatever it is that you're ingesting. A lot of the things that you take, like I think I shared with you, if you take a thousand milligrams of vitamin c by mouth, you only absorb 19 percent. The rest of it is destroyed by the acid that's in the stomach. But if you wrap it in this protection called the lyposomal, you'll be able to absorb 93 percent. So taking something like glutathione, which

Speaker 1:          02:30:46       exactly he didn't say, you take a thousand milligrams of vitamin c. He said if you do, you absorb 93 percent. If you take. He's just giving numbers. I'm saying if you take a thousand milligrams of vitamin c, he's not recommending that as a dose. He's saying if you do, your body absorbs 19 percent. That's true. He's saying if you wrap it in a lyposomal structure, your body absorbs 93 percent. I'm kind of stunned on what you're saying. I got wrong. I said he said a thousand milligrams of vitamin c and you'll absorb 93 percent of what you said wrong in was he's telling you to take a thousand. He wasn't telling you to take anything. What he's saying is if you take a thousand milligrams of vitamin c, your body will only absorb 19 percent. If you wrap it in this lyposomal structure, your body will absorb 93 percent. I know he's not recommending that as a daily allowance. He's not telling you to take it. You're trying to find a way to be right here.

Speaker 4:          02:31:39       I think I'm repeating exactly what you just said. I'm just kind of stunned at that. You're pointing out what I said was wrong. I said, I mean this, this is. This is kind of deteriorating and it's not entertainment quality here. No, no.

Speaker 1:          02:31:54       Explaining where you air in the way you cast judgment and that you're. You're incorrect about what he was saying, but you were your main point. Where he's wrong is why do you need that much vitamin c in the first place? What's the big deal, but this lyposomal thing, you were trying to diminish him. You're trying to find ways to diminish his point, but he's correct. All he gave me, he gave you a number. If he didn't give you a number of a thousand milligrams would have. He said 100 milligrams. What have you said? Five hundred milligrams. this point was your body. He came up with a number for a point of reference, but his point was, your body only absorbs 19 percent. He said then if yoU take it lyposomal, your body absorbs 93 percent. He didn't mean that you have to take a thousand milligrams. He doesn't tell you to take a thousand milligrams. He just gave you a point of reference for explaining the bioavailability of lipos somo products as opposed to the standard form of

Speaker 4:          02:32:41       desk. Justin, can I just summarize my position and we can move on just in two points. Point number one is he used very quack like language throughout the nine minutes that I listened to saying it's amazing, and I became. Yeah, sweetie. Yes. Say which? Which made me very skeptical of his motivations and of the quality of his information. Um, number two, you do not need to take a thousand milligrams of vitamin c. He didn't say you do this. This is not a strong man. This is right. This is summarizing my point. My point right now, his point, my point is that you do not need to take doses of any doses of vitamins or other supplements unless you're one of the rare people who for some reason it has a vitamin deficiency, which is, you know, you need to be pretty sick or have some problem to have any need for any that you were criticizing him for saying that you need a thousand milligrams, which is in fact not what he said. I don't. I. Okay. I don't think he would have said that unless he was trying to imply or suggest that he's going to take vitamin c.

Speaker 1:          02:33:42       I'm sure he thinks it's a good thing to take. Vitamin c is a matter of fact. That's the reason why people don't get scurvy. Right? Take vitamin c is good for you. It keeps that from happening. If you go on a long boat trip with a bunch of assholes who were eating dried meat, take your vitamins. Say, look, there's nothing wrong with vitamin c, but what he's saying is he gave a point of reference. He started with a thousand milligrams. If you take that, he. It's a figure of speech. You will absorb 19 percent if you take it liable. So emily, you absorb 93 percent. We're beating a dead horse. You're wrong. Here

Speaker 4:          02:34:08       I, I am flabbergasted that you're saying I'm wrong, but let's just move on. I mean this is just going around in circles. This is silly, but it's, it's, it's,

Speaker 1:          02:34:18       it's highlighting the way you think and the way one of the things about the way you think is this desire to be right and you have a very strong desire to win. You're criticizing him to be right and I think you're wrong and I think you're wrong about a couple of things. You're wrong about your initial description of the way he described things as wrong and you don't like the way he used adjectives or hyperbole and you said that's what I'm talking about. Okay, that's not exactly what you're talking type of language was what was what I was real good point is that he said that you could not get drunk or that his friend wasn't drunk, but that's a really good point. That sounds like nonsense to me still sounds like nonsense. I think that's a, I think he exaggerated or I think he told an anecdotal story of someone who's bullshitting him.

Speaker 1:          02:35:00       Unfortunately, those nights where you drink and drink and drink and you just can't get drunk, you've had this experience fucked up. What I'm saying is, man, you're a hard line dude. You don't smoke any weed at all. Do you know? There you go. That's what you need. You need a little cooky and a massage. Here we get a thai massage. Pull your arms back to walk in your back. Relax, man. You. There's, there's, there's, there's a lot of merit in what you're doing and there's a lot of merit and what you're saying. I understand your arguments for this hard stance. I totally understand it, but I also think that sometimes diminishes your actual point, which can many times be very valid. Such as, well, this, this whole shit. We're doing this dance about vitamin c. Why do you think he brought it up? Why do you think?

Speaker 1:          02:35:44       You talked about wanting to talk about glutathione. He wanted to talk about, if you listen to the whole podcast, he talks about a variety of different ways that we can improve our health and things to avoid, especially head impacts and he, you know, it goes into depth. He's a very, he's a very interesting and very charitable guy. You're not a bad guy at all. So I was confused as to I could see how you would get upset that statement, absolutely. But All that other stuff leading up to the statement that sort of flavor the statement and make it even worse and grander turned out to not be true

Speaker 4:          02:36:17       anytime. Anytime you're suggesting selling, promoting miraculously easy solutions to complicated problems that should raise a huge red flag. And all of the language he was using suggested a miraculously easy solution. Words like the words he was using, the uh, being. Um, I think he actually, in his defense, he used a lot of those words just to describe it's a fax as an antioxidant, which is pretty much universally accepted online. Um, well. But what effects is an antioxidant? It's a strong antioxidant. what has, what has been what the current state of antIoxidant research is that supplementation has no benefit. The antioxidants that you get from your normal diet are more than enough that your body can, will need to use supplementation, has no benefit.

Speaker 1:          02:37:06       Oh, how did they can lighten me? How do they test to see the benefit of antioxidants and antioxidants? A couple minutes.

Speaker 4:          02:37:14       This goes to the whole

Speaker 2:          02:37:16       question of oxidation versus antioxidant. Sounds like it's a really simple question. Good versus bad. Oxidation is part of so many different parts of your metabolism. Converting the energy and sell to converting your chemical energy and sell to Connecticut injured. That's. That's oxidation. You can't just simply say antioxidants, good oxidation, bad. It's not as simple as that. Okay, but no one's saying what you're saying is that what you're saying is antioxidants have no benefit. If you take them as a supplement, supplementation of antioxidants has been found to have no benefit. Where is that? Is that published somewhere?

Speaker 2:          02:37:55       If you google that sentence, I'm sure you'll find it supplementation of antioxidants, but how do they know the difference between taking it with the. The benefits of taking it with food and the benefits of taking it as a supplement. Well, because we can chemically measure what's in the food, we can chemically measure what's in a supplement. We know how much your body uses and the number of tests that have been done are all going to use different methodologies and I'm sorry I did not memorize. I'm honestly, I can't tell you. I'm honestly curious. What I do as a science writer is summarize the available research, so what? This is what I'm confused about you. if you are taking it in food, there's a benefit from it. The amount of oxidation that you get into normal diet. Yes. If you don't eat a normal diet, then I presume that if you were going on a starvation diet or something, then I suppose you'd probably want to take a multivitamin.

Speaker 2:          02:38:50       You at least get your vitamins. You wouldn't be getting anything else that you'd need, but you'd be getting vitamins. I suppose the same is true of just about any supplement if you're going to starve yourself, but the best, the best advice of all is to simply eat a normal healthy diet because those things, those, those aspects of nutrition or available in that normal healthy diet and their bio available, there's, you know, there's six basic things that you get in food. Number one is water. Number two is amino acids. A number three is carbohydrates, sugar, um, number four is fats and five. Number six, what am I missing here? Oh, fives, vitamins and minerals. So these are all the different classes of things that you need and any normal healthy diet has all of those that your body is going to use because actually you need quite tiny amounts of all of those things. Your body actually uses very tiny amounts. Any normal diet, the reason you poop and pee is because you ate more than you needed. Supplementation is trying to pour water on a bucket that's already overflowing. Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. The reason you poop ps, not because he ate, drank more than you needed, you're going to poop and pee if you just drink the exact right amount too. You can poop and pee all the way to starvation.

Speaker 2:          02:40:07       No, you can't. You'll stop pooping if you stop eating. If you keep drinking water when the water passes through your body, it's not because you drank too much water. You drink. If you drink a glass of water, okay, and that water goes through is exactly what your body needed in a few hours, you're gonna need it as a waste eliminator. Your kidneys are going to continue producing urine until there is till you dehydrate until you're dehydrated, but there's not a balancing act where you can hit the certain sweet spot where you eat exactly what you need or drink exactly what you need. Look, I'm not talking about finding a sweet spot. What I'm saying, pooping and peeing is because you ate too much, drank too much. That's not true. You're taking my words to literally. I will. That's a very literal statement, isn't it?

Speaker 2:          02:40:53       I mean, come on. That's ridiculous. Medical statement. A doctor would listen to that medical statement. What are you saying that what I'm saying is supplementation of any of these things is pouring water on a bucket that's already over full. You don't need more sugar than your body is going to use. You don't need more minerals than your body is going to use. You don't need more vitamins than your body's going to use. Anything that you eat of those that is more than you're gonna use is going to be treated from your body somehow or other, sooner or later. That makes sense. That's what I'm saying. Okay. I'm, uh, I would, I would love to know what studies they did on antioxidants and what they know, the benefits of. I mean, they absolutely have measured the benefits of it from food, the individual nutrients and antioxidants and what sort of effect they have on the human body.

Speaker 2:          02:41:40       Um, and what I'd really be curious to find out what studies disproved that or prove that. Okay. Here, if you're on google right now, google scup, toyed antioxidant. Not going to read your stuff. Silly. I'm going to, if I'm going to google stuff, I'm going to google people that disagree with you, but if there's a lot of people that do agree with you, in all fairness online, if if you. If you. If you want to find out if you want to ask what my sources were, where I got the information, and that's where you'll find it, the references at the bottom of the episode. I just wonder what the motivation of these studies were, what, what the protocol was, and there's a lot of variables like this new study that came out that said case closed multivitamin. Researchers came out and said that multivitamins don't work well if you know what the study was, that they actually studied the, the, the protocol that they used and what they actually tried to do.

Speaker 2:          02:42:26       It's kind of irresponsible statement to say vitamins don't work. case closed. What they did was they gave multivitamins these hard multivitamins to physicians over age 65 and they showed no improvement in cognitive decline, so they took people that were already declining. They gave him vitamins that were these hard fucking synthetic vitamins and they showed no, no decline, no, no ceasing in the climbing of their cognitive function. another one, high dose multivitamins had no effect on the progression of heart disease and heart attack survivors. So these people are already fucked. they already had a heart attack. They give them high levels of these. Again, synthetic multivitamins, these compressed pill form, you know, centrum one a day, jammies that nobody digests, and then another one, the third study, which actually is fairly positive concludes that limited evidence supports any benefit from vitamin and mineral supplementation for the prevention of cancer or cardiovascular disease.

Speaker 2:          02:43:22       two trials found a small borderline significant benefit from multivitamins, supplements on cancer in men only and no effect on cardiovascular disease. So that's a small barely measurable effect from these shitty synthetic vitamins on people who are fuCked. People who are already sick, people, their bodies are already dying. Like to say that vitamins don't work based on those three components is a ridiculous. Well, you know, a really unfortunate aspect of the world of science reporting. Something that I've come to learn over and over and over again, and it's, it's pretty depressing is how news makes it from the lab into, onto people's computers or gotcha aspect of the title, right? Yeah. The fact is that universities were so much research has done, they have pr departments and they are responsible for keeping attention on this university, keeping, keeping the money flowing, and the pr department at a university is going to spin what they see as the most reportable aspect of the research being done.

Speaker 2:          02:44:28       They send out the press release and then the press does exactly the same thing. They look at it and look for the most reportable aspect of this and it's often, um, often it's completely wrong by the time it gets to the presses because they'll report the sensational aspect of it. And what you'll often see, I follow a lot of science writers who do this a lot, is they, they kind of reverse engineer these headlines that have become so prominent. And it's always. Some scientists find that this will kill you. Scientists find that this is a miracle cure. And when you reverse engineer those headlines and go back and look at the original research that was done, you'll find often it said exactly the opposite of what the headline says. It's really difficult to come up with, um, kind of a journeyman's interpretation of sCience news by reading, by reading mass media.

Speaker 2:          02:45:17       Yeah. They did publish the study though. The title of this study is enough, is enough, stop wasting money on vitamin and mineral supplements. And this is the title of the article that was released. I think they took an inflammatory position that I don't think it's supported by the evidence and the research that they presented. And it's very short sighted. There's many, many aspects to a to health. And when you're dealing with someone who is already really fucking sick, which is all three of the people that they described that they tested these things on all groups of people, you know, you're, you're dealing with a mean to try to like the rate of decline in people that have alzheimer's and the rate of decline of people with cognitive decline. We don'T have anything that's going to stop that. Like what makes you thiNk the vitamins are going to stop it because the vitamins don't stop it. Be things that would be benefIcial for health are not stopping something that we've never been able to stop.

Speaker 1:          02:46:10       That seems preposterous to say vitamins don't work based on that evidence. It seems to me like this is something that was a predetermined conclusion or the most inflammatory response, wHich we're talking about it. So it's effective in that sense. Sure. Yeah. So 10 minutes. We're almost out. We turn into a pumpkin at three hours in,

Speaker 4:          02:46:29       um, well, there, there is a really unfortunate word and it's consensus and the word consensus. I describe it as unfortunate because it has a very different meaning in popular usage than it has in scientific fields. In scientific fields. we describe a consensus as something not merely that most scientists generally agree on, although that's often true. What scientific consensus really means is that this is research that has been repeated in other labs and the results have been confirmed. The results have been scrutinized. People have tried to disprove them. People tried to find alternate explanations and it has truly past a certain level of scientific rigor. Then we say we have a scIentific consensus in science circles. Consensus means a lot more than it does in popular usage and you will find that the consensus is that supplementation has no benefit among healthy people who don't have a deficiency due to some strange cars, whatever that might be. I think you will always find articles to the contrary or articles like this that sensationalize that into something that it's not

Speaker 1:          02:47:39       sensationalize the the negative aspects of it. I don't think there's really a consensus about a supplementation because in order to really totally, completely monitor like the variations between two human beings, you'd have to have two people that were exactly the same genetically exactly the same as far as their life experiences, their life stress, all the different factors that add up to health. There is a massive range of factors that come into play when you're dealing with a person's health. If you measure a bunch of people with very good diets, rich in green leafy vegetables and live foods and all these different healthy things and no bullshit and processed foods, and then you measure people who have the typical american fast food dine, I think you're going to see that these nutrients is certainly beneficial to the people that eat healthy food are certainly going to have a, a greater instance of, uh, of being healthy but to, to to really break it down and figure out how much of an effect a nutritional supplement would have based on based on that would be like you'd have to take the exact same people live in the exact same lives and one of them would take a supplement and one of them wouldn't me be really hard to figure out and then you'd have to say, well, if you eat healthy, it's the best way.

Speaker 1:          02:48:50       Everybody agrees on that. I don't think I've heard a single person who knows about health and nutrition that says that you could eat shitty food and just take vitamins. It's impossible. It doesn't work that way. You. There's certain aspects of food that's just missing in pill form. You're always better off getting fresh leafy vegetables that are right out of the ground, but taking supplements as well with a very diet, especially if your diet doesn't balance out as long as we're aware of the bioavailability, those supplements, and then we're also aware that your body can absorb some of those supplements. It seems to me like you're hedging your bets. It seems like it's a good idea to take a good, strong natural food based. I'm a supplementation program. Uh, I think generally there's no harm in them, no harm and no, I can say except for the wallet right there, just unnecessary.

Speaker 1:          02:49:36       I don't know if they're unnecessary. If your diet is not totally balanced. Well makeup, but I think it maybe they'll make up some slack and if it can make up some slack than I think that is a, that the beneficial. I think if you have a healthy diet, you're right, you don't need it, but there's a lot of shit that you get from from vitamin supplementation like like there's certain like five htp, like five htp which produces serotonin. If you're, if you're trying to get that from food, you gotta eat like a fucking garbage bag full of grass, you know, you're, you're not going to the amount that you can take in a couple of pills. The extracted form of the, the, the active nutrients like fuck. You'd have to eat a lot of stuff to get that and I think that that science, these people have figured out how to extract these things.

Speaker 1:          02:50:17       They're not just guessing. They're not just guessing what the effects are on the body or guessing how to get this stuff out of food or what. What contains it. They know, and that is science as well. It always amazes me how the human race managed to survive until this decade before all these things were invented. We survived, but that's not the idea. The idea is, are we, are we optimized? And manY times, no, many times we're not optimized. We're optimized when we add supplements, sometimes you know, sometimes supplements can if you were in a situation where you're not getting all the beneficial nutrients, but you add them and then try to balance out your diet as well. I think it can. It can aid you. I don't think it's an either or. I think undeniably healthy food is the number one thing for for health healthy food.

Speaker 1:          02:50:58       Your body is what I was talking to these hunters yesterday and they were talking about how bears that eat certain foods are not good to eat. Like if bears eat rotten fish and eat them, like you literally taste the rotten fish, but if bears eat blueberries, they're delicious and they're there. They actually had a hunting episode about catching a bears, blueberry bears that come out of the dens and just feast on these huge hills of blueberries and they get fat with. With blueberry fat. It's amazing because as they're cutting this fat off, it's like a bluish fat, like the dye from the blueberry actually makes it into their cells. Unbelievable. But it stands to reason that we are also what we eat and if we eat a ton of healthy foods that our flesh is enriched with nutrients are, our tissue is enriched with this, this purified water and these healthy vegetables and good lean proteins and all these different things that are good for us.

Speaker 1:          02:51:50       If you could take that, a little bit of that in pill form as well. I don't think it's a bad thing for you. Like I say, I agree. It's not a bad thing for you. It's just, it's just almost always unnecessary. And so if you want to lead a super balanced diet, I think if you have any kind of, uh, any kind of a diet and if you don't live in, you know, chat or Somalia, you're getting your, you're doing pretty well. So you think that it's not worth it. Your call is that it's not worth it. Like the amount of money spent on providing men's is pretty expensive. Huge. Yeah. If tremendous. And multivitamins, if you're going to buy the. I buy these packs, these men pure packs, these athlete pure packs because it's easy for me to do and I think they're called, I forget what it costs.

Speaker 1:          02:52:29       It's probably like a dollar, a pill pack or something like that. Maybe maybe a little bit more and over time. yeah, that could, uh, that could add up. But for me, I think of it as a hedging my bet. I want to make sure I get as much nutrients in my body as I can. You know, there's a lot, there's a lot more substantial things to worry about in life. There's also things though that the average person doesn't need that athletes do. And I think that that's a, that's another issue when it comes to supplementation. Athletes, a lot of benefit in food and supplementation now can't always have more fluid depending on what you're in. You know, some, some athletes have to watch their weight gotta wash the girlish figure, so they just need to make sure they get some exercise to brian, you and I agree on more than we disagree or not.

Speaker 1:          02:53:09       I, I, I'm sorry if I was rough with you about certain things like defending my friend mark, but if I didn't you would've fucking killed me next time I saw him and I would have to deal with glutosiome and talk for an hour and a half. I just want to review the tweets and how many people have called me an asshole over the. Oh, he can't listen if anybody's calling brian and asshole. He's not an asshole. And I think that your ideas essentially the, the hard stance that you take is because, you know, there's so much bullshit out there and I think it's a good stance. I think it's the right stance most of the time. And I think that, you know, by, by being this hard edge, no nonsense guide though it does eliminate some of the flexibility of this world. The, the real conspiracies are automatically dismissed for the standard, you know, official report.

Speaker 1:          02:53:55       No, I think that's not always good either, you know? Yeah. I mean the old saying extraordinary claims need extraordinary evidence. Sure. If you go around and questioning, you know whether this table is real or whether it's an illusion, obviously that's silly, but you got to draw the line somewhere. I don't know. I had dr mikhal, swami theoretical physicist, and he made me question everything. I started talking about string theory and the fucking particles in the state of superposition where they're moving and still at the same time they appear and denny's a swami. Well, his name is dr. goswami. Oh, I'm sorry. I don't get on racist dude. Happens to be indian. They'll come down on you hard son. There's a billion of them. I want to thank you for coming on the podcast first fall and I want to thank you for just discussing all this stuff.

Speaker 1:          02:54:42       Maybe it's, it's. It's fascinating and like I said, I think we agree more than we disagree and I'm glad we cleared up. Hopefully some of the misconceptions about how I approach things because I certainly am easy to criticize and I'm certainly easy to categorize as well. It's a lot of my ridiculous comments, aren't we all on various things have suggested. Well, I will certainly be following this up on [inaudible] dot com. What does that mean? The battle continues.
