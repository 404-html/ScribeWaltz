Speaker 1:          00:00:08       All right, we're live. What's up? How are weird, right? Yeah. Here we go. Nice to meet you man. Thank you. Yeah, I can't believe we've never met. Yeah. Well, uh, I've been a fan of your music for a long time, so it's Kinda cool to see you in person. I've worked out conversely, so it's cool. So I mean, I don't mean to just jump right into this, but it kind of freaked me out that your have involvement in pro wrestling. The own. The NWA. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:00:31       The national wrestling alliance, the oldest brand in the world I was working for TNA was president for a hot second. Then I got fired. And you were President of TNA. Yeah. Yeah, that's a crazy story. I don't know how much you want to get into that. Well, you know, Dixie Carter own TNA. I knew her through the years. I used to go to shows and stuff like that and um, and at some point they approached me about investing. I said No. Then they offered me a job. I started working for the company. Then they would, they have started having money problems. They started putting money in and through the contrivance of all that, then I started getting more power in the company and putting in more money. So then it became like, well, if I'm going to put in all this money and I'm going to have all this power, I want to run the show.

Speaker 2:          00:01:14       They basically said that was cool. And then the minute I had the spot, it was like, game of thrones. They all started trying to kill me off and then, you know, wrestling's weird because you have this weird mix of reality and fantasy and it's hard sometimes to know where one thing and the fans get into both the behind the scenes and the fantasy. So no one's quite sure sometimes where the blur is. And he had got pretty crazy for a while. There's a lawsuit. I'm a real lawsuit sued. I sued, and this is a quick funny thing. Um, people continually write that I lost the lawsuit. I never lost the lawsuit. I lost one of the motions which led to them mean negotiating. And we settled out of court. But the judge, the contract that they signed, that would have allowed me to take over the company under the, under the motion that I had filed, the judge basically dismissed my motion because the contract they had signed with me was illegal under Tennessee law even though a Tennessee lawyer had negotiated on the company's behalf and signed it. Whoa.

Speaker 1:          00:02:17       That sounds like some double cross wrestling type guy. So it'd be like

Speaker 2:          00:02:20       you did a contract with me and then I sued you. And then the judge says, well, even though Joe had a California lawyer sign, it's illegal under California law. So therefore the contracts meaningless.

Speaker 1:          00:02:32       It was bizarre. How does one go from smashing pumpkins pro wrestling and then go so deep that you're like an owner? Yeah, no, it's, it's pretty wild and unexpected for a lot of people, right? Yeah, yeah. No, I get that a lot. Um, and I've learned and I've actually, I've actually learned over time, it's just best to keep the world separate because the music fans don't want to hear anything about the wrestling. I mean, they just don't want to. They just, they, they get the a that I'm a bit goofy, but they just don't want to hear about the wrestling thing they asked. They asked the worlds to be kept separate. Did they ever get mad at you? Oh yeah. Yeah. You know, and you can appreciate that. It kills the gimmick. They want me to be this gothic vampire guy or whatever, and then it's like.

Speaker 1:          00:03:13       And then, and then there's pro wrestling. It's just, it just totally kills the gimmick. It's really funny though. I think it's awesome. I love it when people just get into what they like. Well that's something I appreciate about you. You know what I mean? Like I've watched where you guys go deep dives and mma and other things. It's like, I think it's cool to have multiple interests. I at the renaissance man thing. Yeah. Well I think for, for some reason people shy away from them because they think folks are going to be confused. I don't care. Yeah. Good for you. That's awesome. Yeah, no, I'd grown up in Chicago. There was a really rich wrestling history in Chicago growing up and my, my, my great grandmother watch wrestling. I mean it was like I grew up in, at four years old, I'm watching Dick, the bruiser on television and this was also the era of hockey fights and I'm roller derby.

Speaker 1:          00:03:58       Oh, road debbie. So we'd watch hockey, pro wrestling, you know, it was in the family and then later I found out that my other great grandmother also watch wrestling, so both sides of the family, both her great grandmother sweatshirt wrestling. So it's just in the blood I guess. We liked that we liked the car and have at all. Well, I'm always amazed at Roller Derby. I've never made like a serious comeback. They tried, they kind of did the, you know, the tattooed girl's doing roller Derby hipstery type thing. It had a moment there. Well, I know I had a friend who was into it and she was that type. I just thought, well that seems like something that would catch on today. Yeah. They transitioned from like Roller Derby to suicide girls. Yeah. It was like to get a little hotter, that girl, you can be thick and be a roller derby girl.

Speaker 1:          00:04:43       You could, you could eat all the carbs you liked, but didn't roller derby back in the day was huge. Yeah. I mean they were doing like packed arenas and stuff. That's crazy. Well, it's fun to watch. It's pretty wild. Yeah. I only see him go after each other and skating around. It's pretty aggressive. It's fun. It's fun. It's like racing plus fighting and hip checking each other, you know, it's early days memory, but I remember thinking, you know, there's something sort of hot about the whole thing. I think especially in Chicago, the women's Roller Derby was bigger than the men's, so that says something. Yeah. I didn't even know there was men's roller derby, like thinking of men's Roller Derby. I, I'm completely drawing a blank. I always associated it with like tough women. Yeah. Yeah, that's what I'm saying. I think the women's thing actually had some sort of staying power where the men's, I think it didn't have the same alert or maybe. Yeah. Yeah. I guess, uh, you're, you're my age. You remember killer Kowalski Course? Yeah, I remember watching that when I was a kid in Boston watching it on the, on regular tv, you know, that those guys were great. I mean, it's a golden age. It's like anything you can go back and sort of romanticize it. And um, I think that's part of what we're trying to do is, that's the cool thing about the nw is we actually possess that history and, and so our job is to sort of update it, you know, to bring

Speaker 2:          00:05:58       it, to bring that tough guy thing back into the modern world in a way that doesn't insult the audience's intelligence. So the Nwa is that older than the wwe I 1948 is the Nwa. And the cool thing about the end was history was you had all these rival promoters, including the mcmahons in the northeast that eventually sort of formed a kind of ad hoc association to create a better business in essence, get everybody on the same page. And what they would do is they named one champion the champion, rotate through the different territories, come in and take on the whoever was the local guy, they build up the local guy and then a guy like rick flair would come in and beat the local guy and it would always be like a bit of a scrum. And then he'd come back for a second, there would be a cage match and then rick flair would move onto the next territory.

Speaker 2:          00:06:44       And that's how those guys rotate around and everybody made more money. Wow. And then the government got involved at different points because there was collusion. There you go. There's ric flair with our belt. Actually I follow him on instagram. Yeah. Yeah. I mean Rick, Rick's rick in a dusty, dusty Rhodes, or are probably the two most prominent chance that the Nwa had. So just to be the owner of that history is so humbling for me as a fan. It's like, wow, that is so cool. Yeah, that's pretty wild actually. He's, uh, he's quite a character and still is like, even on instagram stories, stories are legendary. Stories are absolutely wondering, 30 for 30 just came out about them and I'm hearing it's like one of the best ones ever made. Just the day to day, maybe two days ago. Oh cool. Then I, and I'm not trying to speak for rick, but you know, there's, there's an example of somebody where it's like the persona and the real life person sort of blurred.

Speaker 2:          00:07:37       Right. And it's hard to figure out who was who at any given time that you know, that's the case. Like dice clay. Oh yeah. Okay. Yeah, yeah. He used to be Andrew Silverstein and the dice man was a character needs to do on stage as he now is. He now become 100 percent all Manson's that my friend had friends, Marilyn Manson. He's the same way. It's like they become, they become the gimmick at some point and sometimes you're not sure who you're talking to, but, but at some point you also have to respect that that's so intrinsic to their world that maybe it's almost easier just to become the gimmick. Right. Instead of having to live. You don't have to turn it on and off. Yeah. I'm the other way, I've, I've gone out of my way to kill the gimmick, which really it actually hurts business and people get mad at me because they wanted to know they want the fantasy guy, but I can't live like that.

Speaker 2:          00:08:23       It's impossible for me. So they want you to be almost like a caricature, like a Moody Salads, rumbling a, you know, whatever, you know. That's why a lot of this stuff on me that's clickbait is based on the character that I both created and people want me to play. Wow. That's like one of the biggest memes of last year. It was about a year ago was like me at Disneyland. I don't know if you've heard about that. So it's classic. I was on a ride and somebody took a picture of me on the ride and for whatever reason I just don't look happy at that particular moment. And I got this great, this great to infect the guy in the room. My tour manager Jug was the guy sitting next to me in the photo and a. There you go look. And it was like massive viral, like that's perfect.

Speaker 2:          00:09:06       And I had a great date, like I met, I met, I met tons of fans, I took pictures with everyone. I love Disneyland. I had this great day and that became like this massive thing of like see, he's miserable even at Disneyland. That's hilarious. That's funny. What a perfect picture. Right? Right. So, and even ended up on family guy say, look, that's very funny man. That's very funny. That's got to be exhausting. Like having all these expectations that aren't necessarily, that don't totally aligned with who you really are. A, it used to be because I felt like I dunno is the keeper of my image or something. I felt this responsibility to sort of manage it and that's when I just let it go. No, well, sorry to interrupt you, but it's like at some point I decided crazy was better for business. Like I'm okay with people thinking.

Speaker 2:          00:09:52       No, it's, it's totally okay because I'm the exact opposite of nuts. You have to be. You're certainly eccentric. Yeah, that's fine. You know, I come from a long line of eccentrics. I mean my father was a drug dealing gun toting musician. Was It really madman? Yeah, yeah. Drug dealing. Oh yeah. What kind of drugs? You name it. Really? Oh yeah. Wow. I mean it's a, it's a like quick stories. Like when I was a kid, my father was a musician, so I remember I used to like, I wasn't allowed to touch his guitars but I was allowed to look at them. So I remember one day I was walking past the bedroom and I saw a guitar case under the bed and I was like, oh, I wonder what that is. Did he get a new guitar? So I went and slipped the thing out and I flipped it open.

Speaker 2:          00:10:33       It was, it was a sawed off shotgun in a guitar case. Just lay in there, you know, in the house or you know, I'd go to open something. It would be like 10 pounds of weed, you know, it's just this system. That was the, that was the world I grew up in. Where did you grow up? Outside of Chicago. About an hour outside. Wow. But yeah, my dad, my dad got arrested a bunch of times and massive bus and drug. It's just crazy. Then got people knocking on the door in the middle of the night and, and getting shot at and my dad says he's been shot at nine times. Never hit. No, that's luck. Stabbed two or three times. Jesus. My favorite story with, uh, my, one of my favorite stories, my father was, um, he was doing a drug deal and or he was buying drugs and like, so he stops and wearing the guy got in the car and then the guy pulled out a gun and stuck it in his ribs in and did like give me all your money.

Speaker 2:          00:11:24       And my dad looked and said, kill me base because he was unhappy. So he figured I fucking just, he said, just kill me. And the guy, the guy flipped out and left the car and he told you all this. Oh yeah. I got a lot of these stories. Post-Haste yeah. Is he still around? Oh yeah. He's still around. He's still kicking. What was it for him, like seeing you as a son? As a weird thing? Because in the beginning he was very dismissive of the music. Yeah. He was not supportive of me playing the guitar. He and my father was a great musician. I mean, I mean that with great sincerity. My father was truly talented and I'm in the beginning he was not supportive at all, didn't want me to play the guitar, didn't want me involved in music. And even after I put out my first album, which went on to be at the time was like the most successful independent album ever released.

Speaker 2:          00:12:14       So it wasn't like an insignificant moment in my life. My Dad would just kind of shrugged her shoulders, was like, it's okay, you know, it was like, what are you talking about? Like wow, you know, if you know, my earliest guitar heavy, there's cool stuff, Solos. And he was just like, yeah, it wasn't until my second album in the band blew up. Then he started kind of changed his tune. Then he became more supportive. Then he got really weirdly jealous who. And then he started doing weird things like he call me and it'd be like, um, if you need me to write you any songs, like I'm like number one. And he's like, he's asking me to write songs. It was so weird, but then he was also a lot of drugs and so there was that, you know, there's that interweave of like and weird stuff like, you know, um, you know, one day he calls me and he's like, my dad always played this cool 19, 64, purple flying b.

Speaker 2:          00:13:00       That was like his guitar, you know, and my, my dad, to me it was like a star and he still is in my mind. So, um, he told me one day, you know, when I die, I'm going to give you my guitar. And then fast forward four years later, he calls me up. He's like, yeah, I'm gonna. Put this guitar and Ebay. So he said, you do you want to buy it? No, I had to buy the guitar. You're supposed to get what he does. Yeah. Fuck yeah. It's just weird stuff like that. It's been a lot of that. So anybody who's grown up in that, those types of situations, it's not talking about. It's like wacky world. You're never quite sure what angle was going on because the need for money, depending on what situation is going on, you know?

Speaker 3:          00:13:37       Yeah. But you weren't reinforced. You reinforce this idea that I've always had that. Everyone that I know that's interesting came from a fucked up childhood. I couldn't argue against it. It's hard because. Do you have children? I have one son. Yeah. He's. He's just going to be too. It's for me, it's, it's so. It's a conflict because I take care of my kids and I'm around and I give him a lot of love there. Not fucked up and I'm like, my kid's going to be boring. I think all of my friends, all of them come from fucked up household chaos and they created the pressure. Created these diamonds.

Speaker 2:          00:14:16       Yeah. There's something to be said for the adversity and my dad would even say to me weird things like, it's good you had a fucked up childhood because it made you successful. Yeah. Thinking like I would have preferred like Disneyland with you. You know what I mean? Maybe I wouldn't have been miserable at Disneyland if it wasn't for you dad.

Speaker 3:          00:14:35       Man, I think your story's amazing though. I mean, I know it probably sucked growing up like that, but damn, to be able to tell everybody your dad was his guitar playing tote and drug deal in psycho. I mean that's a bad ass story. Yeah, there's

Speaker 2:          00:14:52       this. I think you'll appreciate this in the, in the gangster tradition. So there was this thing that happened when I was probably about 10 or 12 where there was a local club and you know, and my dad played there all the time and I came back to the House one day and the house was full of just like smokey equipment, like you could smell like smoke, fire. And, and he said, Oh, the club burned down. And so they had ran in the fire or retrieve the gear, some kind of story like that. And so that was the story for years was he was eating across the street pancakes at four in the morning and saw the club burned down. Years later I heard the real story. He was in a car with a chick doing whatever, and he saw some mob guy walk in the club with gasoline, light the club on fire, so he knew it was arson, but because he knew it was mob related, he couldn't say anything and that's like, that's like every story is like there's the real story and the story I got when I was a kid, so he ran into the fire just to get equipment.

Speaker 2:          00:15:48       Yeah, I think he ran in and got his guitar. He was able to save his guitar and then. And then. And then of course the police came and questioned him because they knew he had was there on the scene or something. And of course he said I didn't see anything because he didn't want to die because of Chicago with the mob. I mean, forget about it. Especially back then in the seventies, it was like they ran the town, they got Kennedy elected. Well, yeah, I mean that. I mean, the stories about Chicago are legendary. You know what I mean? Like people used to come to Chicago back in the day. It's a little bit different now. People come, PAC man, the city is so clean, it's so organized. It's like, yeah, because it's run by, you know, Capo is all over the city. You know, every ward had its capo and

Speaker 3:          00:16:31       yes to Congo has is uniquely violent history and even to this day with, with what's going on in the south side with all the gangs,

Speaker 2:          00:16:39       it's, it's, it's shocking to me as somebody who was born in Chicago, I still live in Chicago, that it's just like we've normalized this insane violence in our, in this community.

Speaker 3:          00:16:50       We don't even realize. I think most people have no idea how much gun violence

Speaker 2:          00:16:54       those I heard the other day. I could, I could be wrong and I'm sure you can find, but I think somebody said the other day, there's been 3,700 shootings in Chicago already this year and I think we're already over 600 gun fatalities and this isn't like every year now. Wow. I mean I just, and even trump at some point flooded out like maybe they should bring the national guard. I wish they would do something. I just. Such a dis generational tragedy that just keeps going and nothing seems to happen.

Speaker 3:          00:17:21       Yeah. And it seems to have a lot of momentum behind it. Like the murders they, they've, they make people have revenge murders and then it just piles on top of each other and it doesn't seem like there's any, any stopping it inside.

Speaker 2:          00:17:34       Well, here's the thing, and this is the classic tale. Now. It was reported the other day that the car jackings in Chicago have gone up like 200 percent and now those carjackings are filtering into the nice neighborhoods. Uh, so now you're gonna start seeing some action because now, now

Speaker 1:          00:17:50       it's blowing up past the sort of, you know, I mean, look at that, the shot clock, a person is shot every two minutes and 20 seconds a person is murdered every 12 hours. Oh, two hours and 20 minutes a person is murdered every 12 hours and 23 minutes. That's a lot. Wow. I mean, it's my home and I just, you know, I have a. I'm a guy that I met when I was down there. He was a driver. He drove us around and he was saying that uh, he used to be a cop and that would happen was they arrested some of the top level drug dealers. I've heard this exact same story and as soon as they did that there became this power vacuum. And then for years I got a little insight information for years. What I'd heard is that they had this sort of like as long as you stay on this side of the street, we'll kind of, we'll look the other way for this, but you got to keep your people in line over here.

Speaker 1:          00:18:44       And I know enough people in the PD that, that was sort of the general understanding. Like even like I remember one time because I knew somebody who worked in the, in the, in like the gang taskforce as like how come there's always whores on the bridge on Friday night. Like don't you guys see the 50 whores and the bridge? And they said, no, we, that's where we tell all the horse to go so we can protect them. We'd rather have them there so we can keep an eye on them. And we know what's going to happen anyway so better we control it. So that was the way Chicago started operated was like we'll tolerate crime up to this level in twice a year. We'll run everybody in just to Kinda make the, make it look good in the paper. And then apparently whatever they did that created this power vacuum, that's just what I've heard.

Speaker 1:          00:19:24       I don't know. Scott was a former cop and the way he was describing it was pretty absolute. He's like, they made a mistake, the, this solution that you were saying of like kind of like saying, hey, keep it over here or keep it under wraps and we'll arrest a certain amount of people. It sounds like maybe that's the only way to manage it. Well the one thing I do, I have heard from people that are in those communities is that literally the. And this may be supports. What you're saying is that the, the power divisions are like block the block. So it's almost like an insurgency where it's like two blocks versus two blocks versus one block versus three blocks. So literally if you're walking on the wrong side of the street, it's not even like neighborhood to neighborhood, it's like block to block, which is crazy.

Speaker 1:          00:20:10       And just growing up in that neighborhood, having that be your normal as a child and then growing into adulthood around that and having just used to people getting shot used to shooting people you. I mean if there's that many people getting shot and that many gunshots going off, everybody must be common. I mean it must be common everyone. Yeah. I don't know. It's just crazy. That's just heartbreaking. It's such a unique town too. It's an amazing city. It really is. Yeah. I mean we have this weird bare knuckle history. Yeah. And it's still there, you know? No, no amount of yuppies moving and it's changed as sort of working sort of ethos while you. It's sort of symbolized by the food that giant pizza. Yeah. We like to eat depth pizzas. Insane. That what you deliver those pizzas, by the way. Did you really? Yeah, that was one of my gigs.

Speaker 1:          00:21:02       I bet it builds your arms up heavy. What? First time I ate a Chicago deep dish pizza, I was like, okay, is this really a pizza? Like what do we see? This is a casserole. Yeah. Yeah, but it's like tardy people too. It's like there's something about Chicago that seems to me to have like the momentum of the old days still deeply entrenched in it, whereas that doesn't seem the case in La and a lot of other big cities. Yeah. It's just like kind of weird Yuppy yuppy thing. I call it yet, but I don't know what you want to call it, but if it's like South Park did that episode where it's like, it's not like once the whole foods moves in like everyone's supposed to live a certain way. Did you see that episode? But it's like this funny bit about like how the whole foods sort of anchors down this new way of life.

Speaker 1:          00:21:50       Some kind of like, you know, riff on that said it does. I bet it does in some way. Yeah. So it's this idea of sort of like a, you can drop this homogenous idea of what modern cultures like in any place and it will just sort of riff out like a spore. Yeah. It's like we've got the whole foods and we've got the, you know, the starbucks and, and now we're all going to be nice to each other or something. It's like a weird, you know what I mean? Like we're all just going to start behaving better because, you know, whatever. I think I understand the joke. No, I do, you know, I think uh, but again saying your environment that you grew up in this chaos and then coming from Chicago and coming from, you know, the stories you're telling about your dad that had to contribute to like the, the deepness and intensity of your music.

Speaker 1:          00:22:38       Right? I Dunno, I, I certainly revolted against suburban life. Yeah. I mean the suburban life of that world. It's just, I just, I just couldn't take it. Yeah, man. Just couldn't take it. The mall, the mall, the Strip mall vibe, whatever. That was just a rat in a cage, right? Yeah. Well, the, well, the great thing is then I traded one imprisonment suburbia for, you know, rock and roll aesthetics and you know, who's, who gets to say who is integral and you know, who's cool and not cool. Oh my God. That would, that drove me insane to WHO's selling out. Yeah. I mean the first line of um, uh, uh, the first line of our second album is freak out and given it doesn't matter what you believe in, you know, it's like, you know, it's like you gotta you gotTa play by now you've got to play by these rules. You've got to kiss this ring and you know, it's just music. So He's, the weird thing too is that people really enjoy you when they're the only ones who know about you. And then as you started getting bigger and bigger, they start looking for holes. Yeah, we blew that up early though.

Speaker 1:          00:23:44       We believe that we glued up really early. We made a lot of enemies really early, which is crazy because, I mean, the enemies I made in the early nineties, I mean, I still have them. I mean they're still sort of lurking out there in various holes. It's weird. He's like those, those, those, you know, inner seen rivalries never end, you know, between bands or. It's like I've had weird experiences with like people not with Nirvana people but like people who were in the nirvana world. There's still like this weird like because I'm from Pumpkin World, like pee out sometimes I'll have weird stuff happen and I'll dig down and find out. It was like somebody who used to work in Nirvana world trying to cut my ankles 27 years later. Like so weird. Like so parochial. The whole Nirvana scene is a very strange scene. You know, whenever the main guy commit suicide and this oddly conspiratorial way, did you watch that fucked up movie that's now a lot of people don't know.

Speaker 1:          00:24:43       I was sort of around for a lot of that stuff. So I know a lot of stuff that I've never sort of talked about. So for me watching that stuff is like, it's a, it's replaying something I don't want to replay. And B, I know a lot of the stuff is not based on fact because I was around for a lot of it and no one's ever talked to me about it. So people tried to pimp me out like in a q and a with fans and asked me questions like I'm suddenly going to talk about it. You know what I mean? Yeah. That, that documentary was so strange. It was like, how does someone get it

Speaker 3:          00:25:12       way with that? Like the recreation's, like if you weren't there, you don't know what the fuck they said. So if you don't know what the fuck they said and you're putting words in these actors' mouths and having them play it out like you're just this, this should be illegal because you're kind of. You know what I'm saying? It's like your car, especially when you're talking about a murder mystery, you're, you're, you're, you're saying that it wasn't a suicide. You're, you're, you're at least putting out the idea that it might be a murderer the way you're doing it. And it's by manufacturing words that you have no idea if they were ever say it's complete fiction. Yeah, yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:25:44       yeah, so like, that's, I, I, I, I was around for the before sorta during and, and certainly a lot after and I know a lot of stuff that again, I know is not in the public domain and so I, I go with what I know. Right. You know what I mean? Yeah. But it's, that whole nirvana thing was. I mean, I remember the first time I heard Nirvana, I was a kid in Boston and this buddy of mine played it for us and we were, we'd never heard anything like that. We were like, Whoa, yeah, I, this, this thing just fantastic. A new thing, right. Like a new, like here's a crazy little Boston statistic for you. We weren't played, it was nirvana, pumpkin's and bullet Lavolta we played at that little club. It was like an art club across from fenway. I can't remember what it's called. Access or, right. Yeah, but you know what I'm talking about. But yeah, we played there like, I don't know, 92 wasn't even sold out. Oh Wow. It's like 700 people kind of thing. That's seven people with an awesome

Speaker 2:          00:26:43       story. Yeah. Yeah, right. Wow. So you're, you're working with Rick Rubin now? Yeah. That's awesome. Eric's fantastic. Is that like though for you being like a guy who's Kinda like, you kinda controlled everything before, right? Yeah, totally. So what is it like for you to have Ruben in the mix and. Yeah, well rick's of friends. So for me it was like I was sort of at a low point and he kind of picked me up when I was down so it was like I didn't mind sort of trusting him with like the head part of it all kind of like you deal with that part and I'm just going to sort of be up to the performer and the weird guy in the corner and give you relief. Oh yeah, yeah. I felt like it allowed me to focus on the music and the performance and Sorta just freed me to just, you know, whatever.

Speaker 2:          00:27:30       Because sometimes you can psych yourself out. I don't know if that makes any sense. Like you can have a really good song, you know, it's a good song and then you start second guessing yourself and they start thinking, well maybe this song is not good enough, and then that'll, that'll infiltrate into your performance as opposed to being free. Like, Hey, I've just got a good song and if that one doesn't work, I've got another good song. So letting rick kind of do the picking and choosing and that's a good take and that's a good song. It was just like, okay, I'm just going to kind of just go down this road. It took me back to sort of a more innocent way of approaching the work and I'm very grateful to him for that. That's awesome. Yeah. It's got to be quite a mind fuck to create something and then practice it and rehearse it over and over again and tweak it and mess with it and not know really, like not, not almost not be able to be objective anymore.

Speaker 2:          00:28:16       Yeah. Well the weird thing is is I hope people can appreciate it. How. I mean, it is like at one point when I. my ear was really at the ground, I was able to do that. I was able to be objective and subjective, be the writer and be the producer and I hit a lot of home runs, so then you get kind of like, I know what I'm doing. Right? So then when it stops working, you have two choices. You can blame yourself, which is the natural thing you should do, or you can blame others and once you start blaming others, now you're in this hall of mirrors. Yeah. Yeah. You know, instead of raising your hand saying, okay, I've had a good run. Now it's like getting a coach or something like maybe a guy goes on a losing streak and need spring in a new coach to say, I think you need to work on your offense.

Speaker 2:          00:29:00       You know what I mean? Just somebody to tweak you. Yeah. But when you're flying a thousand miles an hour and you're selling gazillions of records and making all this money and you're surrounded by a bunch of sick fence, they're not going to tell you, hey man, you need, you need, you know, you needed the doctor to come in and kind of search, search, head out. Yeah. So then you start going this way and then that's when it gets like hall of Mirrors. So that's where, that's where my own Hubris sorta gotten my own way. I couldn't accept that I got on a losing streak and then, you know, go to somebody like rick and say, I need some help. I need some objective help. I'm. Did you feel yourself, like when you were listening to the music that you were creating, did you feel like you were on a losing streak?

Speaker 2:          00:29:34       No. No I couldn't. I couldn't. I couldn't intellectually understand why I was failing. It didn't make any sense to me. And sometimes it's just generational. It's the market changes, whatever. It's not personal. It feels incredibly personal, which is why it's easier to blame somebody else. Like you don't understand the depth of my, my work here, I'm so deep and you know, you're not following my, my met a path or say, you know what I mean? And look, it's most, most entertainment is popular, right? I mean you're, you're a comedian. I mean it's like if you get them to tell a bunch of jokes and the audience doesn't laugh, whose fault is it?

Speaker 3:          00:30:07       Well, the, the mindfuck of music to me has always been very fascinating because you guys create it in like a vacuum or totally. And then you bring it into the people. Like when you release an album, they get it and it's done. It's like, Holy Shit, here it is. And you know, big fan plays it for the first time and they're listening to it that I go on it like it's, it's all. Whereas we have ideas and I need an audience to create like I need to be around them. I can't, I can only create so much on a laptop. Most of it has to be like fine tuned. And so by the time I record something already,

Speaker 2:          00:30:45       no. Yeah, it's already been tested, right, so that's. Go back to my point, if you get on a winning streak and you're, you're creating things in a bubble and then they work well then you want to take all the credit for it. You forget all the thousand hours in the bedroom that you listen to Jimi Hendrix or you know, Bauhaus or merciful fate or whatever you know, like that gave you all these ideas. You, you know, you don't want to give them credit. You want to be the author of your own success. It starts patting you on the back and

Speaker 3:          00:31:14       yeah. I'm sorry to interrupt. I just want to be very introspective in that regard. Like you, you have a very, I'm a failure with failure would do that. Is that when you say failure though, but you still have massive amounts of fans are still

Speaker 2:          00:31:25       DPA expected? Yeah, I'm, I'm, I'm weird in that I've always been willing to talk about the process, which again is anti gimmick, but also, um, uh, I, I've always approached it more like a performance artist in that I'm after the bigger message of how work intersects with fame intersects with personal feeling intersects with personality and, and, and how people perceive things like I like all that weird Andy Kaufman, uncomfortability. That's part of my attraction. So I've been willing to use myself as the battering ram, which is how I ended up becoming a meme, right? Because people, people latch onto these personalities I've created, which of course are ancillary to my real personality, but they don't. They don't necessarily want to give me credit that I'm sort of controller of the forces at play. So if I say something dumb, people assume that I'm dumb. It's hard for them to assume that I'm saying something dumb on purpose because I want a reaction. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:32:22       When you become a hugely successful musician and your life becomes touring big arenas, doing radio shows, getting on the bus, getting on the plane, all of a sudden, does it make it difficult to have like

Speaker 2:          00:32:39       that

Speaker 1:          00:32:40       time or the. The actual experiences to continue to create?

Speaker 2:          00:32:45       Yes. Because you get so deoxygenated in the bubble that you start writing songs about being on tour.

Speaker 1:          00:32:52       Yeah. Like comedians will tell jokes about airline food. Yeah, exactly. You got to becoming sort of like you're trying to take people in the insularity of your experience, but it's not that interesting. Right? At some point it becomes unrelatable. Well, I always said that about like A. I mean there's, there's a lot of bands, but some of the great allman brothers or Leonard Skinner, like they had a bunch of songs about leaving, about getting away from women. You know, Lord, I was born in rambling man. So yeah, there was so many songs about just getting away from women. Yeah. The other day I heard that crosby, stills, Nash and song. It's like just a song before I go. It's all about he's going on tour and they go to the airport and it's uncomfortable. It's like, it's such a going onto her song. Yeah. But it's like, it's really not that relatable to most people know to a lot of people. It's not. Yeah. I mean, skinner had a shitload of those. They really did have quite a few songs about like getting the fuck out of dodge. They were good. Such a great band. Giant fan. I mean, they're probably the greatest thing to ever come out of Florida.

Speaker 1:          00:33:58       It's arguable, you know. I'm trying to think who else came out of Florida? Uh, Jim Brewer. I thought we were talking about that already. Just talking about music. I don't have anything else when it comes to music. Who else? Pit Bull. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's uh, the, the. So do you, did you feel it while it was happening? Like when you're, you're doing these mega tours and everything. Do you feel like this staleness and the creation?

Speaker 2:          00:34:32       Um, I did. Yeah. I think what I tried to do is change personalities, change musical directions to reinfuse things. And it worked up until a point until my mother died, like in 96, in, in a, in a weird three month period. The drummer left the band, my mother died and I got a divorce in like a six month period. And so I try to use that as fuel to sort of pivot where I wanted to go musically. But I wrote this very introspective, dark record, which a lot of people really like now. But at the time it was like so antithetical to this big rock scene. Um, yeah. And it was castigated for being an idiot. And I went from golden child to idiot, you know, in one fell swoop. And

Speaker 1:          00:35:23       well, so many great artists are a prisoner of the early success and rightly so.

Speaker 2:          00:35:29       You know what I mean? I, I have a much greater appreciation for the zeitgeists effect of the public. Don't know if that makes any sense. It's like, it's like how many. It's like guys, did Elvis have three youtubes, had two or three. Frank Sinatra had two or three or four. I mean, there's something about when it all seems to make sense, like the public fascination, the artists place in time that work that's being created. There's a sense of like familiarity, but also something is happening and everybody wants to take part in it and so I have a much greater appreciation for that moment. The Ego of the artist wants to Vince yourself that you're always in that moment and that's just impossible. That's just impossible. There's just no way. It's just the cyclical nature of creation. That's such an important thing to say for people listening, for people that struggle with this themselves.

Speaker 2:          00:36:20       Here's something like you say that. Yeah, it's. It's actually kind of makes sense. It's like, it's like, it's like a typical example. It's like falling in love and expecting to feel that feeling forever. It's just not gonna happen. You're not going to feel the same. No. I would argue if you are, there's something wrong, right? You haven't matured into a deeper relationship, so in the same thing an artist needs to mature into a deeper relationship with their work or their relationship with the public or their relationship with themselves. And if you can do that and you look at great examples. Johnny cash, Neil Young, Tom Petty when they get there, everybody comes back, Bob Dylan because they think, okay, now you're giving me some new information. This isn't just a riff on the thing that you gave me before. And um, and I think the public has shown over time the willingness and the ability to follow artists if they're willing, if they're, if they're able to go to that place where they might not something new that actually is like a cultural contribution and not just sort of more of what they already know.

Speaker 2:          00:37:18       I think that's so important for you to talk about it. I'm so glad you do because for a upcoming artists and in all sorts of genres, just people who were involved in creating the here, someone as successful as yourself, talk about the various struggles of the mind and, and have momentum and the, you know, the different stages and various points of your career. So important. Yeah. The music meant his business plays this jet I mind trick on you where the whole thing set up to be patient and take advantage of your weakness. How so? Well, it's like, um, I, I can use, I'll use the music businesses and example and I'm sure there's plenty of parallels across the entertainment spectrum. Um, you, you, you, you struggled to get the contract and then the contract is sort of, you know, the indirect indentured servitude type of thing.

Speaker 2:          00:38:05       We, our first contract was seven albums, essentially 14 years. So I signed that contract when I was 23. That's crazy. Okay. So I'm signing a 23 years old and we signed a contract that's supposed to take me into 37. You'd signing a contract for more than half your life and if you look at the shelf life of most artists, it's for to. So they're basically anticipating your entire arc. That's so crazy. You don't have any leverage, you know, other than that, they want to sign you. He signed the deal and then it becomes this weird dance of like, can I sustain success? Yeah. If you get success and you have leveraged, they'll get out of your way because you're making them a lot of money, but the minute you're not making them as much money, then they step in and they start playing these Jedi mind tricks on you. We know. What do you know the public's gonna forget about you. I mean, I've heard all these things like, you know, this kind of weird like, yeah, you're in the room, but you know, we're the arbiter of whether you can stay in the room.

Speaker 3:          00:39:05       That's the weird position that record companies had for a long time that they don't seem to have anymore.

Speaker 2:          00:39:10       My wouldn't. I would argue against that because they will do well. They've moved to a different set of circumstances and I'm not as conversant as I as I once was, but one thing they do with certain younger artists, but I think particularly more in the pop realm as they do these three 60 deals where it's like if you get a perfume deal, if you like your whole world, we owned a piece of your whole world and famous such a great quotion in American life. Now that you can see where kids would trade fame and give and be willing to give away, like the the profit part will. They'll take a risk

Speaker 3:          00:39:41       at the long term ownership.

Speaker 2:          00:39:44       Right? So let me jump in there. So if you actually survived the cut, let's say, let's call it phase one, you're successful, you're a name and now you're in a place to either renegotiate or your deal is up or whatever. I once had a conversation with a very powerful music executive and I said, and I was friends with the guy, so I was like, give me the insider psychology here. Now that I know the game that you run, what do you tell people like me when they get here and he says, oh, it's just, there's always a price. So they know that even if you get through the matrix of the whole thing and get off the other side, that there's just a dollar amount that will buy you back in. Whoa. They're not worried that you'll go independent. And in fact if you look at a lot of the machinations of the music business over the last 20 years, especially with the rise of the Internet, it's to keep people in the system yet they don't want true independence.

Speaker 2:          00:40:37       Right? But it seems like, look, I'll give you a look no further than the deals that the record labels cut with the streaming services. They got into ownership equity deals with the streaming services in an, in an, in an arrangement for them to have an equity position. They agreed to very low rates for the artist's music. Ah, so, so when you, when you listen to Bob Dylan Song on spotify, Bob Dylan's not getting a lot of money for that, but as spotify and the other streaming services raise up in their equity position, the labels benefit. So the labels pimped out their own artists to take a greater equity position in a rising business. It's like, you see what I'm saying? Yeah. They weakened the artist's position to take a better position at the table themselves.

Speaker 3:          00:41:22       That is fascinating. And they, they weakened the monetary position of compensation in order to get equity in the company.

Speaker 2:          00:41:29       Right? And now, and now you see it where a metallica's management for example, has come out. And, and, uh, especially, uh, Youtube, former manager Paul mcguinness come out, they're trying to take on youtube now because youtube has got this weird funky position where they'll pay on licensed music but they won't pay for covers. And you know what I mean? Youtube. So like one of the big targets of the business, because whatever deal they agreed to with youtube 10 years ago is super weak. And, but again, these are all machinations that go on above the artists spot and quick thing into your, into your world. When Mcgregor leaped out and did the fight with mayweather, he creates this whole different set of dynamics because he's, he can, he can run his own game. Yes. UFC can't pay him. That kind of money. And last I heard is like maybe it's going to do another fight. So I'm not, I don't want to get totally into that. But my point is as you see where those dynamics, where people step outside the system, it changes the game. So it's actually kind of, you could now, now, and I don't want to, you know, I've never met Dana White, but if Dana white could go back in a time machine, maybe he'd pay mayweather, Mcgregor more money to keep them in his world because now that he's out,

Speaker 3:          00:42:41       I don't think connor would have accepted that. Okay. But I, you recognize the unique opportunity that he's in. So he probably wasn't any upon talking about stuff as a fan,

Speaker 2:          00:42:51       the other side of fence. But my point is, is when you see, when somebody breaks out of this sort of the matrix of how the game is set up, right, it creates this weird thing.

Speaker 3:          00:43:01       Yeah. And they have a few today though that have kind of figured it out through youtube and all these different online chance. The rapper, I don't know much about his business, but I know he's sort of worked out this other model for himself that Jamie knows a lot about them. I know he's getting money from a way other places than just the traditional a record contract. Big deals from major companies like sprite another and he's still independent, right? Tech technical word. They would use to monitor him. Like he's an independent artist, but he's got a Michigan behind them. So I don't know if he's independent, you know, I'm good friends with Sturgill Simpson and sturgeons tried to educate me as to how the record business people in, in the fold with the owning your merchandise and your likeness forever and all these different things. It seems. It seems crazy. We actually,

Speaker 2:          00:43:50       we actually signed a clause. It is. It said in this contract pertains to this universe in any universe, not yet discovered.

Speaker 3:          00:44:02       What would we signed that clause? Who wrote that? The record company. Jesus fucking what do they scientology. That is crazy. Like we literally had a sign

Speaker 2:          00:44:12       thinking it was like this contract pertains to this known universe and any universe. Not yet. I

Speaker 3:          00:44:17       discovered that is fucking insane. That is insane. Like if someone found a parallel universe somewhere and they figured out they could sell music to them, it's apparel. They haven't heard the smashing pumpkins get over there quick shoot a rocket ship filled with cash

Speaker 2:          00:44:32       over there that, you know, why they put that in is because the, when, when they transitioned to cds, the contracts didn't account for cds and what they did, it was a very uh, it's a very classic thing is. So they had to go back and renegotiate all the deals because of the CT technology. This would have been like whatever, eighties. So they went to every artist and they said, look, it's this new technology, we're not sure it's going to work. So you've got to take a price cut. We're only going to pay you seventy five cents on the dollar so we could advance the new technology. Oh Jesus Christ. They're dirty, they're dirty. The spotify thing is dirty.

Speaker 3:          00:45:10       The uncomfortable hearing, how they weaseled that, how they negotiated cheap prices for the performers. Then they got an equity position in the company so as the company grows because they don't have to pay much and they get all this music, they get money from that. That is sneaky. Dark fucking. Hey, three d chess shake, game of thrones, man. It is game of thrones, but I mean obviously it's, it's an, it's an organism surviving in the face of Napster, right? Like napster comes in, file sharing comes in and they're like, Holy Shit. Okay, so the Internet is just out there wild and free and you can just download the music. That music is now digital. We can't control it and it's just going and it drives some people crazy. I had Paul Stanley in here and you can see the fucking anger in his face when he's talking about people stealing music. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:45:54       I, I, I, I was one of the first people that came out for napster because I thought the music business shit get in bed with napster and Ssa, let the monster grow. Right. I thought they should've brought napster and house and made it like a given them a per whatever. Yeah. But I mean if you want to be technical, I mean the thing I helped support, I mean it probably costs me $30, million, $40,000,000. Napster did. Yeah, that whole world. Yeah, sure. Yeah, yeah. I would imagine. I'm not, I'm not here to bitch. It's like the world went on and I'm not the only person, you know what I'm saying wasn't targeted at me and I supported it, so I got nothing to say, but I mean, yeah, at some point when you can't pay your, you know, your stupid mortgage on your fifth property, you know, you know, sad to Disneyland, you know what I mean? It's like, I wish I had that money, but it's a weird dynamic of,

Speaker 3:          00:46:45       of the Internet, of, of the free access of information. And then when a song, it's your creation can be boiled down to information. It's not that much different than forwarding an email in terms of people's.

Speaker 2:          00:47:00       The reason I support it in the beginning was I thought that the free association with music would create a more holistic fans finding what they want and that we would do well in that ecosystem that turned out not to be the case. Um, and I, I think now that it is sort of set up in the streaming service world, now that's starting to be the case because people are finding us because it's sort of organized and they're sort of institutional culture. But when it was free wielding, um, I don't think we played the game well enough to take advantage of it. And, and a lot of trains just passed us by.

Speaker 3:          00:47:35       Yeah, there was a lot of argument that people would find new music because of that in a way that they would have never found if the record companies and the radio stations had a lock down on what got district.

Speaker 2:          00:47:45       Somebody did a study. It's my one piece of empirical evidence like the British, the British Association of something, when it first became a real issue, did a study about people's fidelity to artists, whether they got something for free or they paid for it and they found the loyalty was literally know if they got it for free, that the actual act of purchasing something created a relationship that then created a sort of a desire to want to prove that the relationship was profitable. In essence, I buy your your comedy concert. I didn't get it for free. It makes me actually assess whether or not my. My thing was a good investment and if you prove to me it is, I become more loyal to you because now we're in a relationship.

Speaker 3:          00:48:36       That makes sense. Yeah. Like you want to justify your purchase. It also makes sense. Like when I was coming up and we do comedy clubs and they would pay for the room and you know, have a giveaway free tickets. Oh God. Right. Audiences were terrible. They were terrible. You would think that people would be thankful they got a free show. Nope. They were the worst. Most unappreciative audiences because they didn't have anything invested in it. That's it. It totally makes sense. So you saw it coming, you saw napster coming, you looked at it and you were like, this is something that is inevitable. We should probably figure out a way to

Speaker 2:          00:49:08       to. Yeah, there's some piece of them. There's a piece of video me from like 99 where I say the future of music is streaming.

Speaker 3:          00:49:17       Yeah. Damn, you called it.

Speaker 2:          00:49:18       They put me in some documentary. I haven't seen it, but I've heard about it.

Speaker 3:          00:49:23       Yeah. I've always wondered like, we're not on spotify or would this podcast, but they have. They have podcasts on it, but I'm like, well, where's the money? Where's it going? Like you, you want me to be on. Right. But where's, where's it going?

Speaker 2:          00:49:36       Well, that's it. And I usually using Amazon example, remember for years the wrap on Amazon, was there not a profitable business? Nobody could understand because it was this new model will now you understand that that business model is about, uh, a growing the brand value. Yeah. You know, in essence, if you grow the brand value your, your net worth as a, as a brand. It far outpaces whether or not you're profitable. Hm? Does it make sense? Yes, it does. So that's part of my argument now with music is the brand, and I use my brand smashing pumpkins or the Nwa is far more valuable than my sort of profit loss on paper in the world of the open market. And so as long as you appreciate that, you won't let people come along and gut out your brand value. That's a fascinating of looking at it.

Speaker 2:          00:50:28       I don't think very many musicians probably no, because they're were surrounded by people who are telling them it's a profit loss business full well knowing. I would argue that they, they kind of know deep down to really isn't like a. let's use a good positive example right now. Gnr reformed, you know duff and an excellent slash are out there. I just saw them at Madison Square Garden. I mean that's proving to be a very durable brand right now. You could argue how many wrecker, if nobody cares anymore, that's a durable brand. The GNR brand or the Harley Davidson brand or the Joe Rogan brand, those are durable brands that, that are worth far more than you could sort of prove on paper.

Speaker 3:          00:51:09       The GNR ones is fascinating. One to me because actually just went off the rails and into the woods for so long, shooting his face up with a bunch of shit and it looks like he was just gone. It looks like we lost him. Mean to me, you as a kid. Guns and roses like. I mean they were like welcome to the jungle is like one of my all time favorite songs and I was like 18 or whatever. I old I was. When it came out, I mean it was amazing. And then to see them just have this incredible success and then actually goes crazy.

Speaker 2:          00:51:40       But I would argue, and I don't mean this in a disparaging way, I would argue that the freedom in axle and the path that they took is added to the brand. I think so too, because they're back. I would argue differently. I think that when you look, and I'm speaking as a fan now, when, when, when I look at acts rose, ifc, a free person that means more to me than whether he did the right thing in 2000 X. I'm more interested in that. That's a unique perspective. So you liked the fact that he didn't give a fuck and he just went crazy. I love that about axl rose. I love that about axl rose. I love that. He doesn't give two fucks about eight. I think that's so fascinating because there are true. There are only a few American iconic artists that are truly free.

Speaker 2:          00:52:32       Yeah. And the fact that, so it was hunter Thompson Thompson free or you know, it's like we only have a few of those people. Yeah. Johnny cash. Johnny cash had some weird bad years and yeah, you know, was every year of Johnny cash perfect. Was every year of Neil Young. Perfect. It's the sum total of what that person represents. That I think is the durability. So we as fans, we get into like, well, I don't like the new song or it. I think that misses the mark. There's only one guns n roses in the whole world and I have fought mightily internally to to protect what the smashing pumpkins means. I know it's not for everybody, but there's only one smashing pumpkins. I know that. I knew that as a kid and I got a little lost in it and I've come out the other side and I realized that protecting what that brand is worth is is so much more valuable than whether somebody liked one song or one album or something. I said in 1992, it's so inconsequential.

Speaker 3:          00:53:29       That's such a unique perspective. When you look at Axel rose from the point of view of being a fellow performer to what I. One of the things I really enjoy about axl rose's. I love comebacks. I love when someone fucks their life up and then just brings it right back around. I mean, it's like a good fight, right? Well that's like every success stories are awesome. Love them, but they're fairly commonplace, but success complete fuck up. Success again. Those are the stories. Those are the ones I enjoy and it's very. It's very American, you know, we, we love the comeback and there was some performances of axles when they were attempting to come back or maybe he was touring on his own. I forget which one it was, what he was like off and it wasn't quite there yet. And now you see him now live and he's fucking killing it. It's like he turned it around.

Speaker 2:          00:54:18       Yeah, that's what I'm saying is you could sit there and talk about what somebody did in some year passed, but if they, if they put it back together, they put it back together. Not because they're trying to, to, to, to satisfy something. They're putting it together because the forces within them are not easily controlled, but when there, it's like a good fighter, right. When they, when they put it all together, you know, I've heard you talk in commentary. It's like a good fighter, like manages their adrenaline, manages their, their focus, you know what I mean? You can't go completely hog and you can't be too conservative. You're right on that line. Yeah. And that's what performance really is like. It's like a lot of people outside the bubble have a hard time understanding this like, you know, every night I stepped on stage, I want to do a good show. Sometimes it's just not there to be had. It could be the moon or it could be what I eat for breakfast. I don't know if I could be consistent about it. I don't think that makes me as fascinating as somebody who's like rolling the dice every time I'm up there. Yeah, I think that's much more interesting.

Speaker 3:          00:55:12       Well, that's one of the things that makes live shows so unique, right? Is that you know that this guy is doing it right now. It's all happening. The words are coming out of his mouth. He's managing this moment apparently. Yeah. I mean, when you're a successful performer like yourself and you see one hit wonders, one hit wonders of always freaked me the fuck out, and I don't know why I'm not even a musician, but just the horror of being successful and hitting and then it all going away and then you're fucked. Yeah. I was terrified at that. God has got to be so scary. That's, to me one of the more, one of the weirder opportunities or moments in pop culture is when that kind of stuff happens because with one song, you know, she's my cherry pie. You can just shoot to the top of the charts. Didn't they have two hits though? I think they had a couple. Right. So there to hit wonders. Yeah. But yeah, there's a gang of bands that had.

Speaker 2:          00:56:12       Yeah, I don't want to say the band, but like somebody I know went to see one of those one hit wonder type pants and they, they did their big famous song and the crowd went crazy and then, you know, they didn't see it at the show and then back on for that recording

Speaker 1:          00:56:24       they did the song again the same side. Yeah. And that's like for me it's a performance. It's heartbreaking. It's like it'd be like me playing today twice or something and here it is again. Yeah. That's two versions of stairway would be like the dice man coming out and doing the rhymes again. Yeah, yeah. The thing about becoming a character, what you were talking about, that is, that is a fascinating trap that I could imagine we'd be difficult. The expectations of your fans, you know, I just love the fact that you've managed that. So, uh, so comfortably with Coke Cardio, a lot of people not having, but I'm uncomfortable with it. That's all that matters. I would argue that that's true. I'm like, you know, the plant, I planted these acoustic shows and you know, at some point people start shouting out songs and I, and I just say to the audience, look, the great thing about turning 50 so I don't give a fuck what you want to do, what I want to do.

Speaker 1:          00:57:20       And at the end of the day, right, that sells better. So most of the audience, because most of the audience I would argue, appreciates me being independent even if they don't always get what they want than being a shill. Yes. I don't think people get behind rebels because they want them to sell out. They get behind rebels because they want him to stay real. Rebellious. Yes. Well, yeah. For every person who yells out, I want you to do your old stuff. There's many more people that just want you to be you. Yeah, I would hope. Yeah. Yeah, I would think so. Yeah. You're doing really intimate places like youtube in that Hollywood cemetery is pretty well playing the cemetery and my friend Duncan used to do comedy shows out of there. Oh really? They do comedy there. They used to duck. It's crazy though. I don't think anybody else did it before.

Speaker 1:          00:58:03       Now he just decided it's a bit strange, you know, just weird that they have a concert. Like we couldn't sound check until a certain time because there were people in a bereaved. People coming in to make their funeral arrangements. Yeah. So it's like a weird thing like yeah, we can't sound check till 5:30 because there's somebody in the anteroom making burial arrangements for their family. Yeah. Legitimately. Yeah. Yeah. Like it's a real cemetery that also has concerts. Yeah. How many does it seat to 50. Oh, well it's really small. It's a cool vibe. It's beautiful. I mean it's really cool. It's, I love the old Hollywood stuff, so you know, works for me, but it is a bit weird. Yeah. I literally texted, you know, like an ex girlfriend, like I'm literally playing a cemetery, you know what I mean? It's like, it just sounds so, like what?

Speaker 1:          00:58:47       Yeah, what, what, what chose you or what, what made you choose that venue? Uh, that's, you know, you got your, your agents sort of, you know, when you're playing. I'm playing acoustic tour. I played over two hours literally by myself. No help. So environment helps a lot with kind of creating the atmosphere to do that in the more sterile the environment, the less it feels kind of special. Right, right. And so I do find the environment certainly helps. Yeah. That's a, that's a small group of people to see you. Like what is that like to go from these big venues to doing these intimate

Speaker 3:          00:59:21       setting.

Speaker 2:          00:59:23       I used to really find that I could play a different show, small versus big. And I've found over the last 10 years I blamed the Internet that almost every audience is now the same. Wow. That the expectations of the audience from 2:50 to 5,000 or up is almost identical. That may be have also have something to do with just having a long career and then people kind of say I want to see these songs or something, but I don't find as much willingness to take the journey, uh, used to be because we, we, you know, in the nineties who would do shows in a club and we would play no hits and just play weird besides. And people loved it because it was like, I'm seeing the band, I wouldn't get to see it the normal down. And then at some point that stopped and we would play a small club and play a bunch of weird stuff and people would be furious. Yeah. You would look at twitter after it was like, fuck you, you ruined my night. Oh, it was really furious. Wow.

Speaker 3:          01:00:13       But how many of those people were. I mean like if you're in front of 400 people, how many of those people were furious? Is it three?

Speaker 2:          01:00:21       It would be a lot. No, it'd be awhile. No, it was a lot strange. Weird, yeah, I just, I don't know, I think it's a cultural thing. Maybe it's a generational thing. Perhaps. Don't know. Don't know. It surprised me because I grew up in this kind of anarchy time, you know, Mosh pits and you know, we used to play a 45 minutes on religion playing a 45 minute song today. I mean a 45 minute song.

Speaker 3:          01:00:46       That's crazy, you know. So what do you, do you enjoy being on top of people like that? Like a 250 seat. It doesn't bother me. It doesn't bother me at all. Does it feel different?

Speaker 2:          01:00:58       What did you just get into your music in order to play acoustic? I go super within. I, I, I, I, I found that even because I originally was going to stand in this I know seems kind of minor detail, but I decided to sit and, and I actually found by sitting and being very still and just performing and doing my best job of performing the songs, the audience enjoyed the show better. Like I took out all the show Showbiz, you know when you're standing, you're doing the. Yeah, yeah. You know, whatever your moves, I think creating a level of intimacy and drawing the audience forward is probably the only sort of difference maker that I've found because there's literally no, there's no showbiz. I'm, what can I do

Speaker 3:          01:01:37       you seem very concerned with like you, you want the audience to enjoy it.

Speaker 2:          01:01:41       Yeah. I didn't use to care. I, I used to view performing as an art project thing, which is I want to sort of create a provocative situation and then I want to ride the wave of the provocative situation. And um, and of course I grew up in a generational thing that the audience was sort of interested in that sort of the explosive nature of the mosh pit and you know, this kind of weird sublimated violence that would kind of come out during the shows and we were part of the engine that would sort of bring up this emotional quality. And then at some point, you know, things change. Again, I don't know if it's a generational thing, but I found that um, the only I could play older music with a good heart and an open mind was to get into the others, appreciating it because if he asked me, it's not for me anymore because in essence is an artist and, and I'm not trying to jump in your head, but as, as an artist, I want to be able to say how do I feel tonight and tonight I want to, I've written like 400 songs.

Speaker 2:          01:02:42       So to me I would like to say, okay, of these 400 songs I just feel like playing these 15 songs tonight, but I can't do that because I do have to go out and do the Hickory dickory dock poem. It's like, it's, it's sort of, it's sort of expected. And if I don't I'm going to get lit up. Right? So I had to kind of create this weird truce in my mind where it's like, what way can I do this material in a way that feels heartfelt and genuine? And I found by letting myself appreciate the audience's appreciation of that created like a joy that I didn't have before. It didn't feel like a defeat and uh, and a tapping out to the, to the moment it felt like, oh, okay, we can create this exchange. Was this a gradual process? Took me, it took me awhile because I came from such complete anarchy that does sort of put myself in the straight jacket of being a, you know, growing up in the air.

Speaker 2:          01:03:31       I grew up and it felt like putting on the gold lamay jacket and going to vegas. That's what it felt like to me. You know, it felt like I was really, you know, I, I'd become, you know, one of those guys, you know, doing the musty old routine. It was like this is so antithetical to why be even became an artist. But at some point, again, I had to appreciate that. Um, and I talked about it once with Pete Townsend in private. It's like the idea that, you know, what is your responsibility to a generational memory? Like Pete was talking to me once about how people were getting mad at him for using a and I saw him quoted publicly so I don't feel like I can. I'm giving anything away. People are getting mad at him for using like won't get fooled again in a car commercial and Pete's quote was something along the lines of like, I don't care if you lost your virginity to Mary Lou in the back seat to my song.

Speaker 2:          01:04:18       It's my song. I can do with it what I want. So it takes time to sort of appreciate that at some point if you've been lucky enough and it. And I am lucky enough to have created a few kind of cultural milestones for a generation or multiple generations that they feel very possessive of those things. And so if you're not willing to possess them with them, it almost feels like to them you're rejecting their idea not your own. Oh Wow. See to my mind, I'm like, well, I'm the author. If I don't feel like playing that song. I mean that's my, that's my decision. So you sold them on something and then if you're not buying anymore then it almost feels like you're rejecting their approval. Yes. Yeah. And when you're surrounded by a bunch of sycophantic artists who are literally tripping all over themselves to give the audience what they want to create.

Speaker 2:          01:05:06       This kind of idealized isn't this amazing feeling and we've all been to those shows. It's the greatest concert ever. And then you go to the next show and it's the exact same lines in between the songs. It's Vegas, right? Yeah. I mean capable of that. So my way of feeling like you. But my appreciation of that was to try to get inside the head of why the audience needed that from me because it felt burdensome. Like why me like get it from the guy over there. Like there's plenty of people you can get this vibe from. Why me? Well that's the nickelback thing, right? Like people demand sincerity and if they think that you're in like nickelback not that bad, but there are the fucking punchline of punchlines when it comes to bad, bad music. And to me, the guy's an incredible writer. I mean Chad, I mean he's an incredible songwriter.

Speaker 2:          01:06:00       I like their songs. I liked some of their music. I do, I know it. Some of it is like cliche subject matter and I don't care of. There's a lot of great songs that have cliche sub subject matter, but I don't, I don't think there's anything I. and I'm not trying to. I don't know enough about their world, but I don't think there's anything wrong if that's who you want to be. Yes. Pop to me is predicated on unsatisfying pop. I've said it many times. Pop is pouring, it's pouring and want to get you off. Right? Right. And it's, it's just, you know how they're going to get you off. That's a good way of looking at it. Okay. I'm not that concerned with getting you off. I'm just not. I'm just not. It's just not in my DNA. I was never that guy. I was never that guy.

Speaker 2:          01:06:43       So to. So at some point, you know, pick your age, 41, you got some guy tapping on the shoulder saying, hey, I need you to be that guy. You're like me. Have you looked at me lately? I mean I'm not that guy. He's a very strange so I had to get inside the head of why people needed that, like what that did for them and sort of a very general level. It's sort of, it's a, it's a, it's a community thing or something. Yes. And so there's a way to do it where it feels good, positive, loving and, and, and proportional. Like it doesn't have to be slobbish and it can be cool like okay, this is the right moment for it or I can set this up and now I can do it. Like using the dice man as an example. I've seen him a couple times.

Speaker 2:          01:07:25       I laughed my ass off when I saw him and when I saw him he did his whole routine. He showed up at the comedy store one night I just happened, would they be there with a friend? And he did it like an unannounced appearance. He was fantastic and at the end he kind Kinda, he kinda of made the face and like. And then he went into it, but it felt like it was the only way he could stop the moment. Right. So it right. In that moment it felt like, okay, this is cool. Because it's like, it feels like, hey, you've been good. We ate the whole cake together. Here's the cherry. Yeah. But when it feels like I got to do this because that's the gay. I don't know. I went through that whole process himself. Like he abandoned the rhymes for a long time, didn't even kind of try to abandon the character a bit. I have a little bit of a memory of that. He did a television show, like a regular sitcoms, and he cried on some TV show like Arsenio Hall

Speaker 3:          01:08:16       or something like that, about people angry at him for being controversial. And I don't remember the early days of political correctness when TV first came around. Yeah, yeah. It was A. I think it was a little bit of a trap that he felt like he was in. And now I think in a similar fashion, maybe similar

Speaker 2:          01:08:34       and using him as a sort of a. As an example, how many comedians have actually risen up to that site? Guys? Level on almost none. I mean it's been like a handful. He was hot as you could be ever. So paralleling my own self in that way. It does create this weird

Speaker 2:          01:08:56       cause cause the 20 percent who know every song and and whatever and know every nuance. The other 80 percent they just know the, the greatest hits thing. It's not their fault. It feels weird. Like, is that all I am? Right? I've done all this, you know, didn't you see me when I wave this flag and now they don't. All they know is you're the rat in the cage guy and you can be hostile about it all you want. It's not going to change. Yeah, I mean the amount of times I've been in a parking garage or a grocery store or whatever, and somebody who's very nice, very respectful will walk up to me and that's what they know and if you can be humble, but I think it's pretty amazing that literally I can get off any exit in America and pretty much anywhere I go somebody has some reference to what I've done.

Speaker 2:          01:09:43       That's pretty, pretty remarkable. So if you can get behind that, you can think, oh, that's pretty cool. I'm cool with that. It's, it's not this oppositional thing, like you should have paid more attention in 94. The Revolution was happening. Where were you? You were listening to somebody else, you know, like there's requirements. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And I installed so part and parcel to when you take a, a fringe movement, which, you know, alternative music, grunge, whatever it was, and it's thrown into the mainstream, those social codes and mores don't translate very well to mainstream code. Yeah. If you look at what people have done in the last 10 years, they just steal that stuff. They take this coat and they take this walk and they take this stance and they take this production style and they say, I'll take that.

Speaker 3:          01:10:26       Yeah. They just combined it all together. Yeah, because it's because that's their gig. I've always wondered what it's like when you are. When you're beginning as an artist, you know you're, you're idealistic. You have all these ideas about what the future could be. Who knows? It's all wide open and then all of a sudden, many years later, you are a fucking massive superstar selling out arenas. How difficult is it to find people who understand where your head is impossible. Do you like seek out other superstar musicians? And.

Speaker 2:          01:11:02       I did and I got nowhere. It. They're either really. I've had a hard time ever getting like good data, let's put it that way. The freakiest was. I saw how it changed my inner world, meaning friends and family, how so? My step grandfather, who was a world war two vet, very closed down, classic Eisenhower, Republican type of guy, smart. You know what I mean? Had literally zero interest in me as a kid. I mean, negative zero interest and, and one day I'm sitting there at Christmas and now grandpa wants to talk to me about the economics of my success. Whoa. And it's like, like that got through to him because some guy at work or somebody at the church brought me up and it was like, oh, that's my grandson, you know, nothing about childhood, childhood tiers did anything but that I saw were warped the gravity in my family. And then you get the friend, like, you know, you're different. It's like, yeah, I'm different. Of course I'm different, you know what I mean? You know what I mean? It's like you got a million dollars in my pocket, you know what I mean? I could buy, you know. Yeah. I mean, you know, I one day walked into beverly hills and paid cash for Ferrari and that's just dumb stuff. Like,

Speaker 3:          01:12:21       that's kind of awesome though. Yeah. Yeah. I remember the people don't like the idea of that. I think it's funny, right? It's amazing. You bought a Ferrari with money that you had on you. That's fucking crazy.

Speaker 2:          01:12:33       And it was. And it was the classic story. I walk in, you know, the guy didn't know who I was like, so how are you going to pay for this? And I was like, cash

Speaker 3:          01:12:42       you have a brick with you was like, Oh wow, that's just an awesome thing to be able to do. So I'm saying you go from like literally complete, not abject poverty poor. I had no movie. Right. You know. And then one day I'm like throwing, you know, Geez, around for dumb cars and let's also you, you've reached such a high level that there's nothing above that. Like

Speaker 2:          01:13:08       I have the, I have the antidote, my manager who was, you know, we were with the Metallica guys at the time, he called me on like a Wednesday or something and he said, I can't say for sure, but more than likely based on the calls we're getting, you're going to be number one this week. Meaning melancholy. And I, I literally said, is there a position higher?

Speaker 3:          01:13:32       Like I couldn't process that. There wasn't like another step. Couldn't keep going. Yeah. Yeah. Well that's what I always wondered. Like when you reach a certain level and you're sending out these giant arenas and you one of the biggest bands literally ever look at one of the top, 100 biggest bands of all time. Right? Arguably. Yeah. If we're in there. Yeah, it's in there. Yeah. Where the fuck do you go? Like it had to be this weird. Yeah. I would imagine the madness is the only option. Madness started becomes attractive at that point. God, that's got to be so strange to be just crushing it. Selling out these giant arena is number one. Songs going now what? What the fuck do we do? Do we fade

Speaker 2:          01:14:12       away now? We went crazy. We just lost her mind. It's like, what happened? What was the process? Did you see it slipping away? Or you see the madness and it became, you know, it's like, it's like a bad relationship or bad relationships. You, it becomes a lot clearer when you're out. You know, at the time you sort of do your own rationalization. Like, oh, he or she's going crazy, not me. We all went crazy in four different directions. Wow. And this and that. And the great shame of, of, of my band was musically we were super tight and we never disagreed on music. It was like this weird phenomenon where musically we were like totally in sync. We could produce and write music very, very quickly and it was always the other stuff around us. So that sort of ate at the core. And then when we, when we lost our personal relationship, that's what diminished the musical relationship.

Speaker 2:          01:15:05       But you don't know it at the time because you sort of, I don't want to say arrogance, not the right word, but it's like you have a sort of a, you know, you got a little bit of a thing in your walk and you think you got the world by the unit. What and all good. You think you can power your way through anything because you have, right? You don't understand that you do actually need the people standing next to you. I have such a greater appreciation for my bandmates now that now that I've seen what we actually did accomplish in ink is surrounded by chaos. But then we created our own cast and then at some point it all blurs. What were the things that fucked it up? Was it the money and the fame? And was it the tension? Was it the ego?

Speaker 2:          01:15:43       Um, I think, uh, we were, we were like one of those bad. I'm behind the musics, the very early conversation. I remember we had these managers very early on in and they were coming to town, sort of courting us before we had a record deal and one day they came to town and they said, can we just go out to breakfast with you? Which was weird because it was always the whole band like democracy. And they said, um, they said, uh, know who writes the songs? And I said, well, I do. And they said, well, that's gonna be a problem. Like, what do you mean it's gonna be a problem? And he said, well, songwriters and bands make a lot more money. So our suggestion is you should share your songs with your band mates to keep sort of a kind of a democratic state and the use of examples of bands that did it.

Speaker 2:          01:16:26       And I thought, hell no, I'm not on, I'm not giving them my work. I mean it's my song. So they were like, you don't understand, you're gonna make a lot more money. And I was like, tough shit. You know what I mean? It's like live and learn kind of thing. Why do they think you were going to make more money? Because it was songwriters get a quick lesson. Uh, the songwriter gets paid separate statutorily by the government than the, than the actual copyright of the recording. So if I'm on Joe Rogan's label, you pay the band for the recording, which of course in that case would be split four ways, but you owe me a statutory rate as a songwriter for the sale, which I think these days is about 10 sentence. So every record we, where I was the sole songwriter, I was getting ten cents that they weren't getting a or eight cents or whatever it was at the time.

Speaker 2:          01:17:15       So you can imagine over a gazillion records sold. It added up. Yeah. So I start pulling away financially, you know what I mean? But when you're a kid and you're 23 and somebodies having this conversation with you and you literally don't even have an apartment, right. And somebody is trying to tell you how you're going to make a lot more money. It's like, what does that mean? Fast forward four years later and it's like I'm making a lot more money. So that's sort of SOS it organically. So his discontent, yes. Whether you call it jealousy or not. And then as I emerged as sort of the tour and the big mouth in the band and maybe the person who was most willing to be controversy or whatever, we'd get in a room with journalists and they would just talk to me a and then we get out of the interviews and that the band members would yell at me for them not being asked questions.

Speaker 2:          01:18:04       So there's like this weird thing, like it was my responsibility to push them more as stars or. Yeah. So it's not just about the music, it's about being appreciated and successful. And now in hindsight, and in fairness to them, I didn't appreciate why it was important to them because in their minds we're all equal. We're in the room together. Yeah, you write the songs, that's cool, but at least give me the social currency of being recognized or you know, or somebody would offer me alone a magazine cover. And if I was smart, which I wasn't, I should've said no only the band or nothing. But I was like, sure, put me on the cover. I'll take it. You know what I mean? Right. You probably would have saw thought they would do the same thing if someone came. Absolutely. Yeah, absolutely. And then of course it becomes tit for tat than like a two of the band members went on their own and made a record deal.

Speaker 2:          01:18:56       Um, without me, they got somebody to give them a bunch of money to start a label, which they had every right to do. You know what I mean? So suddenly they're like making side deals and it starts getting all that weird business. And right now again, it's like an erosion factor. You don't appreciate it from within. There's a lot of compression, there's a lot of money, there's a lot of stuff going on and then one day it's sort of hollows out and then it's too late, you know, you can't just sort of sit down and have a meeting and make it all okay. Because the wounds are deep and in our case, I mean the wounds lasted for. I didn't talk to darcy for 17 years and I didn't talk to James for I think 16. Wow. So we'd met named in the heat was, was real.

Speaker 2:          01:19:34       I mean we didn't. There were lawsuits and all sorts of stuff and it's such a common story that I hope someone listens to this part of your mission as well. They won't. It's just human nature. Right. Because I would, it is power corrupts man. Yeah. And again, no sympathy asking him today though. I mean when's that? It wouldn't today. Like I feel like if you were in the similar position today, you'd have hindsight and your favorite. Oh yeah. No, no, I would, yeah. I mean, and even talking about the band going back on a tour and the possibility that it's like I approach completely different.

Speaker 3:          01:20:08       Yeah, so that's what I'm saying. Like power doesn't necessarily corrupt. It corrupts if you don't know what the fuck it's going to do to you. Sure. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:20:15       But again, I'm not preaching for sympathy, but the, and I can't speak for the modern music business, but the business we're in in the nineties, we were surrounded by people who were giving us wrong information. Now were they giving us wrong information on purpose or because they weren't bright enough? I don't know, but we weren't getting the right information. Very few people actually try to sit us down and say, look, this is going to be a problem. Trust me, you know, it's like you're in there with the hounds

Speaker 3:          01:20:44       just right. And they probably don't have the time for psychological management anyway. They're probably in the middle of just trying to figure out how to make money off you. And Maya is my understanding.

Speaker 2:          01:20:54       My understanding is they and I, and again going back to the conversation I had with the executive, they just basically look in, they say you've got four years if you're lucky, if you're lucky, so why are they going to, why are they going to spend a bunch of time trying to hold your hand knowing you're going to lose anyway?

Speaker 3:          01:21:08       What a crazy relationship between the record labels and the artists. It's similar, I guess probably like the pit boss, if you're, if you're having a hot run, it like roulette. The pit bosses just like enjoy it now because we're going to get it back. That's what it feels like. What percentage of musicians or musical artists that get signed by a label and put something out, ever wind up having an actually successful career? Probably less than 10 percent. Jesus Christ. I would say it's probably even smaller. A meat grinder of a business. You would think like, hey man, we're on fucking warner brothers. Dude. We made it. It's happening. They're going to promote us. They're gonna. Push us. They signed us

Speaker 2:          01:21:52       and, and sorry to interrupt again, but the other weird thing is the athlete in the system I was in was even if you were successful, it was set up to make you feel like you weren't successful. Right? Because that was the work. That was the manipulation. Yeah. I once said to somebody who is a very famous name in the business, it's like you guys find a needle in the haystack and then you spend the next 20 years telling them they're not a needle in the haystack. Right? It's it. What I'm trying to say, and I'm not saying it well, is you would think you would be surrounded by people are telling you you're talented, you're special. We want to help you because the more you succeed, we'll succeed and we'll all succeed together. It was the exact opposite. It was like, no, you're dumb. You're wrong. No, you're crazy. Don't do that. You're going to ruin it. And then, and even if you'd say, I want to wear this hat, okay, I'm going to wear this hat. And when it wouldn't work, that's say see to listen.

Speaker 3:          01:22:50       Uh, is that universal? Have you heard that other musicians? I have the same. It

Speaker 2:          01:22:55       was universal because looking back it doesn't feel personal to me. It felt like I, I, you know, use your bad analogy. Pimp Ho. I don't know. Right. It's a weird con thing. That was my experience was a lot of con jobs.

Speaker 3:          01:23:10       Courtney love a piece that she wrote about the music business. I'm sure you're aware of that. Was she, was it recent or. No, no. Bunch of years ago where she was. I think it was actually probably before digital got really huge and it was a lot of people thought she had a ghost writer, but it was really eye opening to a lot of people that didn't know anything about the music business, where the money actually goes and how, how much money has to be spent and how little you actually make. Even though if you sell a shit ton of records, you've never seen this spring.

Speaker 2:          01:23:44       2,000 actually is on salon.com. It might have been one of the years we weren't talking about. They go, yeah, well it's

Speaker 3:          01:23:53       for people that haven't read it. It's pretty eyeopening. I've nothing to do with the music business. I've always been absolutely fascinating as a completely objective observer. Just looking at this whole thing seems so crazy because it's if you do not get signed and if you do not get promoted until recently, you had no chance. They. They literally controlled the rains and the direction of your career. Almost like an actor. Like you can't make it as an actor unless you get an audition and someone chooses to put you in a film.

Speaker 2:          01:24:22       But like the Great Greek mythology type myth thing that the music business has made to critical mistakes over the last 30 or so years that led to its current sort of reduce status. One was they let mtv run a muck on free content and when they tried to rein mtv and MTV basically told him to take a hike in the music business back down. So when MTV stopped playing music content, there was nothing in the music business could do because they'd given away all their leverage to the to MTV. And then the second was when napster showed up and they acted like napster was a virus, that they just need us to stamp out, not really realizing that napster was just the beginning of a whole wave of new technologies and new sort of social interactions or something. Those two critical errors lead to the music business. Reduced position.

Speaker 3:          01:25:11       And it's this music. I mean music has been around forever, but the music business has been around 100.

Speaker 2:          01:25:17       Yeah. I think we're into 120 plus years of recordings. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:25:23       Amazing. How, what a iron fist they've managed to control the business with and, and to sort of wrangle the artists for the most, most

Speaker 2:          01:25:32       part. Well, it's weird. Wizard of Oz, you know, don't, don't, you know, don't look behind the curtain. Have you ever thought about being on the other side? Yeah, I have, but I just don't have that much. I'm actually, that's why I'm more interested in wrestling. I think I liked that. I like the, even though it's this sort of weird business, I sort of liked that because it doesn't have anything to do with music. I have too much damage and too many I don't think I could see clearly. Does it make sense? It's like, it's still too weird for me. Yeah, no it does. It does make sense when you first, when I first to La in whatever

Speaker 1:          01:26:04       90 and had the meetings and you'd be in that, that, you know, hit the office and the people with the beards and everything and they'd be like. So when we put the product out and every time they would say product, I would sort of wince product, like how can you call my art product, you know what I mean? And that's to them it's just, it's cookies and toilet paper. It's, it's whatever. And um, and it's not to say they're not fans and they don't appreciate or they don't care, but at the end of the day it's just some sort of weird business, you know, and like all institutional cultures that are sort of kind of corrupted their court just send it runs on its own inertia. It's, it just does. When you see someone like chance the rapper break out of that system, do you think that that's a model that can be followed or is he just like an outlier?

Speaker 1:          01:26:50       No, it's certainly a model that can be followed, but you know, it probably works because he's so talented. It's like a weird combination. I mean, use the mcgregor example. It's like how many Mcgregor's or are there in the world and beyond being a skilled fighter. I mean the guys in a level talker. Speaking from a professional wresting standpoint, the guys probably the best promo in the world. Yeah, no, he's the best as far as MMA guys and it's also he has in this very unique position where he has insane support from Ireland. I mean insane that you've never seen anything like it. I've been calling fights for a long time. I've been working for the UFC since 97. I've never seen anybody like him. I've never seen any support like the support the Irish people have for him. It's fucking crazy. And you see the videos of when he fought mayweather.

Speaker 1:          01:27:38       Not even where they fought. They were in Mandalay, bay, Irish had flooded Mandalay bay, the walkway from Mandalay Bay as you walk towards the arena and towards where they are exhibited ship, there was nothing but Irish people singing and it's fucking crazy, man. It's like, who organize this? No one who told him to start saying things as organic as an Irish descendant. We know we've been waiting for a long time for conor mcgregor. Yeah, man. I mean poets and Bondo. You know what I mean? We needed a fighter in there to someone who's fun. Yeah. But to see all those people cheer and scream. And I was talking to Daniel cormier about it this past weekend and he's like, there's no one like him. He goes, because he loses, he doesn't lose any support. Like not. It doesn't change anything and people respect the fact that he took a chance and fought mayweather like can. Can I ask you a Fanboy, a UFC question? So it sounds like core may last Jon Jones, right? Is that okay? Any last [inaudible] Jon Jones was on whatever, right? Yes. I mean, how does a guy like that? I'm asking more of a psychological question because he's obviously he's a great fighter. How do you sort of process that? Well, I mean you have to really wonder why it hasn't been established. What happened? Right. So there's a lot

Speaker 3:          01:29:02       of speculation. I don't know if you know the recent most recent speculation that I talked about the other day, but the most recent speculation is that John might have snorted cocaine. That was cut with creatine that was contaminated with steroids because if you look at the timeline, I know you look at the timeline, John loves some cocaine, but if you look at the timeline of when John tested negative and when John tested positive, it is preposterous to think that he thought that he could take it and not passed, but the fight coincides with 10 days out from his birthday party where he apparently got blitzkrieg. So it is entirely possible. Right? That, and this is just massive speculation, but we have done some research online and found that there have been cases of creatine that was contaminated. We buy cheap creatine from China, contaminated with steroids, specifically the type of steroid that he tested positive for and create is often use to cut cocaine apparently, so it is entirely possible that he did blow and that blow had steroids in it through the contaminated creatine and gave it back to cormay.

Speaker 3:          01:30:14       So core me a lost. The question is, did he lose because Jon Jones is a cheater or did he lose? Because Jon Jones is an amazing fighter, so the second one would be harder to deal with because if you lost. Because Jon Jones is an amazing fighter, did coq 10 days out before their title fight and kicked his ass and now they give Daniel the title back. It's very weird, but that's why I was asking more as a fan, like a psychological perspective, a real fucking lie detector test. That's what we need. We do not. We, we value honesty so much and there's very little other than some rudimentary observations they can make with Mri, functional magnetic imaging, a resonance imaging, which do you want to be lie detect this. Strap me up, man. That'd be a good podcast. I try to tell the truth, have you done that podcast as much as humanly possible ever been?

Speaker 3:          01:31:15       Have you ever like, have you ever thought about so and so in a particular way at the opportunity to expose things that I think are fucked up about me, but that one, um, I mean, when it comes to like cheating in combat sports, it has such an intense significance to it that's not, it's not an option or it's not a, it's not a factor in other sports is that you can cause damage to your opponent, like physical damage that could affect them for the rest of their lives. Right? Like that was the case with Vito Belfort, when he fought Michael Bisping, he had kicked bisping and knocked him out and bisping suffered a really badly detached retina in his eye and went on to have several surgeries and now has oil in his eye. Like if you look at his eye, there's permanent oil to protect his retina that he has to leave in there until he decides to quit fighting.

Speaker 3:          01:32:07       And then I'll have another surgery on it. And the question is, did Vitol or land that because he's highly skilled, or did he land it because it's highly skilled and taking testosterone, it's you're, you're, you increase your ability to cause damage and that changes the game. It's not like hitting a baseball. If a guy's on steroids and he hits a baseball and his team won or your team lost, I get how the team would be upset that he's a cheater, but it's just not the same impact. It doesn't have the same ramifications here. Well, especially when you're talking about like the angle of the punch and 10th of a second being the difference between a glancing blow and a knockout. Yeah. And that's what's so crazy is like you get into this fractional idea of what is just [inaudible]. There's so many factors or speed. There's the amount of energy that you have.

Speaker 3:          01:32:58       And then their psychological factors like confidence. There's no, there's no metric to figure out what, what kind of an effect being juiced up psychopath has. Like if you're someone who like Vito Belfort who is already highly skilled and then you pump them full of steroids and he comes out to like, motherfucker, like he just feels like he can't lose and that he has so much confidence and then all this skill on top of that, the seat he's, I hate to pick on him, but he's my favorite example because the difference between him on testosterone and him off testosterone is so radical. Like there has been these photos side to side or the two of them together and you're just like, wow. Like it's like they're one of them's a destroyer. The other one is a dad, like he's a dad bod, you know, it's, it's weird.

Speaker 3:          01:33:47       So if that's the case with John Jones, will you want to pull it up as a related breaking story right now? Oh yeah. There's two to breaking stories in the MMA world right now. But this one, since you're talking about it, Anderson Silva fails out of us. UFC Shanghai main event. Make sense? He's 40. What did he fail for? A sample? A sample b test that failed from October 26th collection. Huh? So it was a couple of weeks ago. That's interesting. From a sample beet test sample sample collected. Oh, okay. It didn't say the actual drug because they don't test sample b unless sample a is. Well, I'm not surprised. This is the other thing going on. Right. Conor mcgregor jumps the cage at Bella tour when he's seven. Conference referee. Mark Goddard. Oh yeah, I heard about that. Definitely don't do that. Yeah. I don't know what that was about. I don't know why he did that. Yeah. You liked that. I've already. I'm already booked in the main event. How do you have time for that wrestling stuff? Just so I just make time. Make time. Because you enjoy it. Yeah. Love it. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:34:56       For all this fucking emo kids that are just massive smashing pumpkins. Fastest. There's so many of them that that must drive them nuts. Yeah. That's part of it. That's wrestling tough shit, right? It is what it is. Yeah. So to answer your question, Daniel Cormier is an awesome guy. I mean, it really breaks my heart when I see people get upset and boo him don't like him. I just don't think they know him and for whatever reason he is mean to be completely honest. He's always going to be in the shadow of the greatest light heavyweight champion of all time. And that's John John's the greatest. I mean he's, he's so uniquely talented and special and just there's something about him all across the board and part of his partying and all that shit is kind of connected to that because he's fucking wild and it's one of the reasons why when he fought shogun for the title, he was 23 years old. He opens the fight with a flying knee who fights a legend like Mauricio Shogun who, uh, who was one of the greatest ever and pride, former light heavyweight champion at the time. John Jones fights him, is 23 years old and is opening move is a flying knee that lands. I mean, he's just, he's uniquely improvisational creative, wild, talented, physically, incredibly dominant, very strong kind of crazy body for the game. Like,

Speaker 2:          01:36:23       yeah, the long, long thing. Strong though, he's not frail, like the difference between John is he's got long limbs. Buddy has that strong wrestling base, so even though he's a thin guy, he's very physically strong. Strange comparison to make, but back in the day, used to hang out a lot with Dennis Rodman when he was playing for the Bulls and he had freakish strength, kind of similar bonding, looked very long like you wouldn't look at them and think muscles and Rodman could pick a 250 pound, may end up with one hand and lift them over a rope. I saw him do it at a club that was acting up and Dennis just rich over. The guy picked him up like this. And then even people would remember NBA fans. Uh, Dennis used to guard the guard shack one on one. Yeah. And that was when chuck was, what, 3:40 years Dennis.

Speaker 2:          01:37:15       And that was when they had the whole thing. You couldn't use your hand yet at the elbow and all that stuff. He got them one on one freakish strength. And you're like, you look at him, you think, how is that possible? Some guys just have that weird [inaudible], whatever that is. It's a lot of times it's those long guys to something is about long limbs and leverage and it's like they have to, if they have long as they have a certain amount of muscle with that long, those long limbs and longer than average. I mean, look at this look. Okay. Freakish in this, you know, this is like the air I'm hanging out with Dennis. I mean, look at Dennis this size compared to Shaq. You. If you didn't know it was Dennis Rodman. It was just some, you know, NBA Scrub, right? You would think there's no way that guy's going to guard him one on one.

Speaker 2:          01:37:55       Especially Shaq in his prime there. There's no way. Yeah, it's a crazy guy. Interesting. Speaking crazy. I tell you a funny story. You got a good story. Yeah. So used to hang out a lot with Dennis and uh, you know, hadn't seen him for years. Was at a restaurant in Chicago not too long ago and um, and somebody said, oh, you guys are friends with Dennis, right? Yeah. Yeah. Oh, he's upstairs. Oh really? We go upstairs, Dennis's crying. Oh my God, I miss you guys. Me and my buddy were hanging out with. I'm telling old stories, you know, seven or eight years, haven't seen him. This is great. Like, uh, when you see a buddy you really love and it's really affectionate and Dennis is one of those people at some point he just gets up and he wanders away. I think he's going to take a piss. Okay. About 10 minutes goes by, I say to the waitress. To Dennis leave. Yeah, he left. Okay. I just figured he's gone. It's just the way he is. He wouldn't even say goodbye. Just gone. I get up the next morning I turned the television, Dennis Rodman's in North Korea.

Speaker 2:          01:38:58       I, by the way, I spent an hour and a half with them. He didn't say anything. We'd go about going in North Korea. Right. So I turned on the television. It's like very controversial. Dennis Rodman's in North Korea. So I texted my buddy and I say, have you seen the news now what I say, turn on the television. And he said, what channel? I said, it doesn't matter. Two minutes goes by holy fuck, because he went through the same thing, you know? Wow. Yeah. What is his deal with that North Korean dude, he just goes over there and hangs out with them and really a genuine, uh, you know, a naive hearted person. So in my best understanding is he truly believes he can affect the world in a positive way. So there's dentists, there's not a bad bone in Dennis's body. Dennis has his issues, but he's not a bad hearted guy.

Speaker 2:          01:39:49       So in his kind of crazy ideological frame, he actually thinks he's helping, so he thinks he can go over there and talk some sense into that guy or by playing basketball open, you know, whatever. He's. Yeah, I mean, so that's not a good shot. I mean, you know what I mean? It's not a good look, but yeah, I mean he's hanging around with a murderer as dictator hoping for the best. But that's what I mean about the naivete. And I don't mean to cache. And Dennis, I really loved Dennis. It's been nothing but a total sweetheart to mind to me in my life, but I gen dennis would in a very naive way believe that he's actually helping. It's a very gangster move to go over there though. I mean it's just the other side of Dennis. It makes a certain sense. It's like, I'll do it. Yeah. I remember when he was dressing up in drag and you know, it's like, I'll be that guy so it's somehow it's sorta works in his. Again, I'm not trying to speak for him, but he was one of my favorite guys on celebrity rehab because he was working out every day drinking water. I used to go into the bowls locker room after games and he would work out after games. Really.

Speaker 2:          01:40:52       We go in and go [inaudible], we're going to go out clubbing or whatever and you go in the locker room and he'd be working out and we have to sit and wait for him to work out for another 40 minutes after the game. And he played. It wasn't like he was had a knee injury. I mean he played the whole game. Like what kind of workouts do you like lifting weights or something treadmill, you know, whatever, whatever he was doing, why I wasn't. It wasn't like light stretching. It was like the energizer bunny. And then we go out and stay out all night.

Speaker 2:          01:41:22       Jesus, they quick. You want a quick story? So I'm hanging out with the bowls. It's the first time they're playing Utah. Um, they, it's a very, it's a, it's a series of bolts probably should have lost, but they didn't. It's the famous game where, uh, the famous series where Michael had the flu and scored 36 points. I know if you know that game, it's one of the most famous games. Michael legit had crazy flu and scored 36 and they won the game and they won the series. So in between one of those games, Dennis knows some billionaire, there's a day off, we get on the billionaires plane and we fly to Vegas. We stay out all night gambling. And this is Dennis, like, you know, rubbing dice on people's bodies and throwing the dice. So drunk they're balancing out of the, you know, the craps pit.

Speaker 2:          01:42:08       And I mean just total mess and you're thinking, how is this going to help us win a championship? Very much a fan mentality. I'm thinking naively I'm going to kind of reign them in so. So we stay out all night. We'd get up, we'd never go to bed. We get, we fly on the private plane, back to make the morning press shoot around back in Utah. So we've only been, we've only been in vegas for like eight hours. So 9:00 AM. I'm sitting in the stands. I haven't slept at all. They do the whatever, the shoot around and Dennis walks up and says let's go back, go back where the hotel. No let's go back to Vegas. So after the morning shoot around, drove to the airport to fly commercial because now the billionaires not sliding them back again and gets on a plane commercial and it's given me shit because I don't want to go back to vegas with him.

Speaker 2:          01:43:03       Jesus kron the off day and this is during the NBA, the NBA finals. So through some sort of weird, you know how the world works. I ended up somewhere, I don't play, I go to play miniature golf or something in Park City, Utah where the bowls were staying and Phil Jackson and his family's had just happened to be there on like an off day and Phil has given me the look of death because I'm the one responsible for dentists go into Vegas. The rockstar dragged on the bad guy and I'm thinking, you don't understand. I'm the one to tell him not to go. I want to win a championship or at least have one now. What are you gonna say to Phil Jackson? Have you ever met Phil Jackson? Phil Jackson is an intimidating guy. He plays very zen on tv, but in person. He's very intimidating. Six, seven, six, eight, and he was legitimately upset at you.

Speaker 2:          01:43:54       Let's just say it wasn't a nice encounter and I love Phil Jackson. I mean, I loved those years. I love those teams and I was lucky to be around them a lot. I used to say, look, watching this teams like 19, 27 Yankees, I mean you will look back very fondly on this time and to even be in that bubble at all and it was awesome. But yeah, I mean catch and shade from Phil Jackson at the height of the Bolus thing. It was just so funny and I'm playing miniature golf and you know, this is so uncomfortable. That is hilarious. Do you still keep in touch with Dennis now? Dennis is sort of. He kind of tried it out into the ether and I, you know, it's hard to follow it. It under my thing. It falls under what I call the celeb friendship. I've had various times had to. I tried to have friendships, legitimate friendships with very famous people and the way they run their worlds is. I'm sure you've encountered. It's like, it's like you got to go through this guy to talk to this guy and then the message doesn't get through and I think, oh fuck all that. I'm not doing that.

Speaker 3:          01:44:53       Yeah, I don't. If I can't just text you. I can't be friends with.

Speaker 2:          01:44:56       Yeah. It gets into the weird thing of like, you tell Larry the guy and then Larry never tells the guy and then the guy's upset at Larry, but Larry's looking at you like, yeah, we had to go do this thing and I just, I can't do any of that.

Speaker 3:          01:45:09       Yeah. There's a few guys that are like that, right? There's a few. It's weird. It's, I feel like when someone reaches a certain level of success, especially fame, uh, they, they get people to sort of handle certain menial tasks and then that person sort of becomes their babysitter.

Speaker 2:          01:45:29       Yeah. I have very few friends that are famous and it's one on one. Yeah. Or forget it. No, the with David. If I'm a fan. I mean there are people I've, you know, I could call them up kind of thing that, I mean they're like my absolute idols, but if I can't have that rapport, it's like, forget it. It's just, it's almost too weird. It's like, because why then am I, am I a fan guy hanging around hope and he's going to throw me a bone and talk to me about their second album. You know, and it's like it gets into that kind of uncomfortable space. You're, you're making the same mistake. I don't want people to make. I don't want people around me. Like some of my friends were in the room. They talked to me like I'm the guy from Glendale Heights. Like there's no star trip with me. Like I want everyone to be straight up. I don't want any of that. I don't need it. Well, it's like what you said, you're

Speaker 3:          01:46:14       talking about turning 50, you know, like you're 50, you don't give a fuck anymore. It's like that's one of the things I did give a fuck before 50, but now you have to declare it. Yeah. But it's great that you are willing to be this guy and be yourself openly. Because one of the things about music in particular, but I guess a lot of other areas of show business too, is that people really protect that image. They protect that brand, they protect that, that thing that they're projecting to their fans, they have this idea what their fans want and they hold that really sacred. But I think pulling the curtain back the way you do, I

Speaker 1:          01:46:49       think it's very brave, but it's also very

Speaker 2:          01:46:52       port. I've certainly had moments in my life where I, I wondered if I had it to do all over again. Like sometimes I'll, I'll, I'll riff with a, like a, a journalist that I know enough to sort of riff with and I say because sometimes they'll say like, do you feel you're under appreciated as an artist or you didn't feel you didn't get to do you to serve? And I'm like, yeah, that's absolutely. And maybe everybody feels that way, but I certainly feel that way. And so my little funny, a sec, a blog question for them as if I'd never opened my mouth and all you had on me was my music. Would you have a different opinion? And they say they always say the same thing. Absolutely. That's weird, right? Yeah. So did my mouth, you know, boot me down. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:47:36       Ladder. You know what I mean? I don't know. It's, it's fun to play. It's like a part of the game. It's too late now. I mean, I think it's a different opinion, but it's not a lesser or greater opinion. I mean, my opinion of you is greater seeing that you are very open, honest. But if I knew you, like if I didn't know you have your music. Oh go. Oh, he's a regular guy. He'd been. A lot of people don't like that. They don't like regular guys know. It's a fantasy world. Yeah. That's part of the music business, right? Yeah. I got to ask you this one thing for sure is because I read this and I was like, what? Here we go, uh, you saw someone shapeshift Oh God. Is it, is that really where you fucking with people? That's true. Really. It's true. Because when you told me joy Kaufman like moments, I was like, okay. No, no, it's true.

Speaker 2:          01:48:29       I would tell you off grade, but I won't say it publicly. Really. The only way I'd say it publicly as if I write it and I've been writing this book for years and it's in the book really. So I'd tell you off grid, but I can't get. Look, I know Alex Jones sat in the seat,

Speaker 1:          01:48:46       right? I know you've been on it for wars. I've been in I think three or four times. Well, what have you been on them for? Is for.

Speaker 2:          01:48:56       I'm mostly talking about free speech. I think that's, I think that's one thing that, that, um, is, is critical and alternative media is to fight that. That's a frontline issue for me. Yeah. This demonetizing, uh, people's videos and trying to censor messages and even how in to twitter exec just recently admitted in front of Congress how they were suppressing a negative hillary hashtags and stuff. I mean, that's crazy to me. Yes, I think so too. That like you got some of you openly saying, yeah, we were, you know, if we're going to sit here and go on and on about Russian collusion, I mean, is that not an in kind donation, will you? You're manipulating people's ability to change it. So as an artist who's been in the public sphere almost 30 years and I've seen people manipulate my image and turn me into a meme and all this stuff, I'm very sensitive to if somebody wants to deny me the right to re to either reply or get my message out, right? As long as we have that ability, I trust our democracy. We need people like you and me and anybody else like great. I think our democracy is better for it. And that includes the people who say things that I don't approve of or like I'd rather have them say it than not safe.

Speaker 3:          01:50:10       I agree as well. And I think it's very important that if people do say those things that you don't approve of or like that other people express why they don't approve of those things are like them. And the only way that happens is if you hear the initial thought, you have to hear the one thing that you don't like in order for someone to say, saying something that resonates, you go, yes. That's why we disagree with that initiative.

Speaker 2:          01:50:29       Okay. So to use any personnel, if we, if we generally agree, than an idea is so aborad or so racist are so bigoted than what are we afraid of because the argument should be that the collective agrees that that is an inappropriate thing to do and express and then socially we can sort of correct course and it gives the other person on the other side the opportunity to course correct to yes. In essence, if you're not, if you're so sure of an idea of being true, what are you afraid of? Why can that idea not withstand the dirtiest most scurrilous thing that can be thrown at it?

Speaker 3:          01:51:07       Yeah. It's one of the more uncomfortable things about people on the left today is this newly embraced idea that you should be able to suppress ideas you don't agree with. That's terrifying. It is terrifying. It's terrifying. I agree. I mean, let's wrap this up so I could hear your shape shifts or. Sorry, I want to Elena, hear that man. It's. Let's put it this way. It's pretty wild. I believe you. I just the people. I will. I will. I will. Someday. You'll put it in a book. Yeah. So, uh, please tell people how they can see you, the, the name of your new album where they can get it.

Speaker 2:          01:51:40       Uh, I have an album out solo acoustic Oj, Lala produced by Rick Rubin. Um, it just came out about a month ago. I'm just finishing up my tour dates in La, so that's pretty much done. I'm going to go record another acoustic album and then hopefully next year they'll be a pumpkin. Stuart. Awesome. Our fingers are crossed.

Speaker 3:          01:51:57       Well, thank you. Thank you. Thank you. My pleasure. All right folks, that's it.
