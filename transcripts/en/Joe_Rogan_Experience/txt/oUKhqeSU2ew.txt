Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Free. You can't hold that pussy over my head because I don't eat it right now. I'm good. Now I see someone annoying. I see someone and knowing that I don't want to be around.

Speaker 2:          00:00:08       That's pretty good for debts. Why? Because you don't like weight watchers has a model. Right? If you're not hungry enough for an apple, you a fucking hungry. Right. Which just makes all the sense in the real. You're not hungry enough for an apple. You Ain't fucking hungry. That's a weird model. Okay. They use the word fucking in that motto. No, I just dropped it in there for effect, but it's funny like they should have a model for if you, if you still want to go fucking crack coal and get blow after you've walked off, then go. I don't think you'll find the energy once you wipe off and cut your legs right off. If you sit there for tech, like if you come to me and go, God, I need $300 I'm going to go kill a crack call and get some coke. Right.

Speaker 1:          00:00:44       What would a heavyweight title fight look like if like, like say if you watch a boxing match and then halfway into the boxing match, uh, there was like a three. Like at the third round there's a break and some hot chick comes in and blows a dude and then after he shoots is not, he's got to go out and fight the next three rounds. It would be interesting to watch, you know like how many dudes fought well after they ejaculate

Speaker 2:          00:01:11       and how many dudes just completely fell apart. Just turtle up cause that takes the fucking Fiat. That's what, as you say, women weaken legs,

Speaker 1:          00:01:18       women weekend, legs rack while they s they say that when you do it for seven days, when you're abstained from ejaculations by seven days your testosterone can go up. I think it's as high as 50% but it normalizes after that and then there's like, well this loser just doesn't get any pussy. Let's just stop making loads. And then your body stops making as many loads. Like apparently your, your body can consistently makes loads as long as you're using them.

Speaker 2:          00:01:44       That's the idea behind it. They keep popping. You keep fucking help. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:04:14       Dude, I drank something to dish water coconut water yesterday. I found there's a big difference in coconut waters. You know, we had, we, we found this out with a c two o the company, uh, those guys came to uh, to visit us at [inaudible] when we're at the Improv and they said the Thai coconuts or what you want, that's like a short tree. It's only like a five foot tree or something like that. And it's not like what we think of these giant palm trees with coconuts. It's not like that. It's a shorter tree and it's like a sweeter coconut. But all those cans go fucking Savoie anyway that they all go south. They will go fucking solid sema seal too. I got them at the house, so come to blow that smoke up somebody's else's ass. That's why I finally tapped out and I go to a little Mexican. I'm violin and fucking right. Yeah. They get $4 he give, he gives me the whole fucking coconut. Oh, right there for the next two to three. If you do blow, trim it around like a Margarita with COPD. Stop with those Kansas Shit because they all go fucking south. This is a great deal called Dao in la. It is a great place called pressed juicery and they deliver them to your house maybe to deliver fresh, fresh.

Speaker 4:          00:05:17       It tastes so much better. He gave up. It tastes so much better when it's like right, fresh and raw like out of the fruit, but I got a cans, I got a case from the CEO to and it's fucking all south sea to the one before that they were in the refrigerator, drank it it, I'll put some sugar in it. Coconut goes a little fucking sideways sometimes. Just put a little sugar, sugar and then you, you'd open up with some ice cubes to shake it up. Sometimes if it's warm up, bro. Trust me, I was drinking coconut water when you were in Columbus. Slumped drinking out of a red cat cock sock that I was going to Puerto Rico on the fucking seven days when you could buy the big fucking coconut. There was no tie around. In 1970 there was no Thai food. There was no ties around, so knock it off with a tight dress.

Speaker 4:          00:06:04       Ties get here and fucking like 78 I have to kickbox and I have to kick box on one. That's when they fucking showed up. When I got to this country was Chinese. A couple fucking jabs and a couple of fucking Koreans don't start that shit. The tie came later. Later on, all dark and shit. Creepy looking, whatever the fuck. I don't fucking dark skin the, I don't know what the fuck they are. I don't know if they have Puerto Rico. They fucking Chinese ties came along. The whole porno industry got tossed on its head. Fuck. Yeah. Those types of skills for the ties came around there. I want, and not even ties, but there's some sort of an Asian invasion that happened because before that there was like river. It was very rarely you see Asian porn stars now there's like a gang of them. And I love it.

Speaker 4:          00:06:45       I love to see dirty Asia except those really like dirtiest one's ever. Yeah. Would you have that one on your podcast and one of them, one of the podcasts, was it the naughty show? Oh, she's Asti beautiful to look at the one with her. I can't watch those man. She gets brutalized. Oh, gagged and tied up and face fucked and know, oh my God, the thing he can't just do something happens somewhere along the line, you know, and I'm doing the that uh, David tell show today, Dave's old porn. I'm doing that right after I get out of here. Will you sit down like mystery science theater style and it's in front of an old porno film and you like mock it and make fun of it and pick it apart. Um, but those old shot, they were completely different. You watch like an old porn. It was just people that got together and then they had sex. You know? It was like, it seems so innocent and complex. Get down to basics. You build a fucking horny cock suck all your life. When was the last time you watched? What was the first time you watch porn? I want you to explain the people and how did you watch it? First Time you discovered point, break it down for me right now. The first time I discovered video porn, like a real point, like on cassette. It was my dad phs.

Speaker 4:          00:08:01       Yeah. Well let me tell you how long I fucking have this government where they used to come to the house real to real. Oh my God. Go for rate 95 you ordered it. I knew somebody had to stay home from explain reel to reel to reel to reel was you actually, if you ordered $22 worth a point, each point real was a dollar 99 cents and this was when porn was just disgusting. When it was just to the point where after that either you became a freak or you fucking said, I don't even want to see that again. That's what happened. So what happened was for $19 not even guys, I'm exaggerating, but 1295 you got three movies and a mini projector. Brian in the mail, he projected projected in the mail. I remember it. So you had a fucking stay home. When is right next to the ad for, do you get some kick sand in your face? Do you remember that ad when the kickstand, you went home, you said Joe, we did $3 and we sent you the whole muscle building shut. You're not the weights, but he

Speaker 2:          00:08:56       also sent you a trophy. You know one of those trophies? I had 92 of them instead of the door push up, you know what I'm saying? And I do a pushup. I just kept ordering Joe Weeder. So you had a fucking put the reel. The reel, correct? Yeah. Tape it to the thing like you were the fucking, you had to do everything in those days.

Speaker 1:          00:09:12       You had, you had a splicer he had, it was crazy. It would fuck it. You had to pull a sheet

Speaker 2:          00:09:19       wall and hope that nobody came home until you got the sheet off the fucking wall for me. Like my buddy's brought it over. We put the sheet in the attic and we all got together. We smoked like a joint between seven of us. And we were all excited to see this point in Austin. And it starts like ten nine eight and they showed this chick taking a piece of bread, putting the guy's cock. And this was way before crap. I don't know what the fuck they were doing to make these chicks do this shit in the 70s it wasn't heroin because he was awake. She put a piece of bread, the guy's Dick on the piece of bread, put Miracle Whip. I'll never forget that memory. And it wasn't even one of the bread is that square fucking redneck be like in county jail and the bitch bullet. And she bit into the guys, me and my five little sixth grade friends looked at each other. And that was the end of the fucking, I dunno if we came in, our parents thought we would just modify. We never watched another point again. That was the end for me. But when the film broke, I remember you got to stop correct. Ryan, you had a stop work whacking off and put the film back.

Speaker 1:          00:10:22       Yeah. And it sucked because it wasn't like, it was just like put the two pieces together. You had the first like trim and cut like a perfect like kite. Then you had to put it in the splicer and get the in here. You've got a boner and you're sitting there rubbing into the tall white. It was horrible. Porn was tough. We had to work for it. That's why you had a work sheet when they would have stag films that they would show at bachelor parties, bachelor parties. They would show stag films like guys would get together and they would show films of people fucking, and they would call them stag films, but it was just porn porn is nothing different. That's what they called it. They called them stag films and they would, uh, they would show them at, at stag parties. Wow. Yeah. How gross of that.

Speaker 2:          00:11:06       Then I went to a theater in Jersey like one day. My friends like Sunday nights to do this shit up in jersey, dirty movies and you sit in a theater and watch it with other people that God was the lowest point, but it's not even low cause you don't know. You're 16, you your let's go have a few beers. It's not gross to you go to the bathroom. Oh the pissing the urine. And some guy just happens to pop out of the stall number two. And he just stands next to you. Like he's looking for flowers. Oh God. You fucking shake your deck. He staring at your day and then you go back to your seat. You could tell your friends. When I went to the bathroom, there was some perverted that you go back to the bathroom and I like that you take it again. Boom. He bumps out of the stall number two and he's sitting next to you. Look, I mean it would be so fucking creepy. The whole lifestyle that's, there's a lot of dudes that had ended it. What

Speaker 3:          00:11:54       is it about sexuality that's so creepy? Is it because it's so repressed, but what is it about like that one desire and so it's, it's, it's so like gross. It's, you know, it's, it's so undesirable. The idea sexuality, like the idea of a, you sit in, in a, in a real like that's a part of sexuality. You sitting in a room like beaten off to videos of people fucking like a bunch of other people in the room too. And they're all like, like looking up all together. Like what the fuck? Why is that so creepy? I don't know. But it is, you know, for everyone was in there eating, fulfilling that desire. There's no issue. There's nothing creepy about it. It'd be in a room and a bunch of people, everybody is eating a sandwich and there's no problems. You know, we're all filling that desire.

Speaker 3:          00:12:37       No issue. I'll go back through it. But he got it. But a sexuality issue, you know, like it's very private and very creepy. And me, even though everybody does it, it's kind of mysterious so of be like to sit in some room full of a bunch of people and everyone's just openly like sort of admitting that we beat off and I'll sit in there together. Oh No. Beating off in front of somebody else. They're all doing man. That's what they're doing with those when they go to those theaters. Not like just watching the film and critiquing it. Wow. Her ass is huge. How does she get all those Dixon, the movie theater. A lot of it. That's how peewee Herman got arrested member, which is hilarious man. How the fuck do you get arrested for beating off at one of those fuck theaters? Like isn't that what they, you're supposed to do? Aren't you supposed to beat off there? No, I don't think you're supposed to be it off. I think you have like private, I mean private rooms I could whack off rooms like in bookstores are different. The whole thing's ridiculous. You know what's going on, you know, do what you were showing people blowing people and you're, you're getting upset because I'm a beats off with the crowd. Look at your product.

Speaker 2:          00:13:38       What was the name of that club where people went and paid money? So Sarah's retreat, Devil's retreat. Something's retreat. Plato's retreat. Plato's Plato's retreat. And what was that? He was a sex club in the 70s and early eighties where you paid, you know, 1000 bucks the door and you went and then you fucked 85,000 fucking people play those retreat thinking. You know, the thing that always got me about sex that, you know, I've been addicted to drugs, so I understand the addiction is when I would get off the bus on 48th street and it's, you know, seven 45 to go to work selling cars and I would come home and roll the joint. I would smoke it right down 42nd street. I would just sit there and watch that guys like you and I, but guys that had families, guys with suits on and tie that before they have to go on with their day.

Speaker 2:          00:14:24       They would have to go into a peep show and you know who I would see a lot of and I'm not hitting to talk to me about, he'd see a lot of Hasidic Jews. Really. A lot of seeds would fucking run in there with that black honor, that whack walk with the laugh factory is today with the laugh factory was in Manhattan. That was originally a strip club on that whole corner. That was strip club fucking world. Not even a strip club. Beat shows where people fucking in a circle and all that stuff. But I'm in, I would sit outside of, you know, because you have to cross that street. That would just sit there and watch people and go. What would make somebody jump out of a tree that was that. You could see them like I used to leave the store. They have to go get a half gram a club card.

Speaker 2:          00:15:04       There's nothing else on your mind. But that coat, I would see them walking off walking outside eight avenue fucking walking left and you could see their body language. They weren't going to stop. The [inaudible] got to a fuck show to see some guy fucking big flat black chick in the middle of a room and you know, some chickens up to you with a tent and you could suck it. It has a family that lives in the suburbs, you know, from Jersey and cleans or that's what always fucked me up. Like that's their fucking freak. That's their freak. My freak was doing two bumps and walk it off though. Four in the morning, there's was going right off the bus at six in the fucking morning to see two people fucking okay.

Speaker 4:          00:15:44       I remember a first time I ever bought porn, uh, you had to go to an adult bookstore if you wanted to buy videos, cause like you could go to some, some video stores like blockbuster wouldn't carry them, but some like mom and pop video stores. And then, you know, of course you'd have to go through like saloon doors you didn't have to do or you go through like beads. But um, I had one time I went to an actual porn store to buy it. And I remember thinking like really clearly thinking and don't fucking look at anybody. Just get through this. Go, go find what you need and get the fuck out of here. We're not here for small talk. Like I'm not one of these people. I just need some, but I don't want to be like, and then I started thinking about it like who are one of these people? Like you think about people that visit porn shop to go look. You know, I don't want to hang out with any of those people. People that go to visit porn shops, but wait a minute, but I visited a porn shop like whooo. Why? Why is it so creepy? But I don't know. But the instinct like automatically is that it is, you know, taking care of your sexuality, especially yourself, it seems like such a selfish, creepy or harass like thing to do. You're sitting there watching videos,

Speaker 2:          00:16:58       no drama, no drama, no drama. You're whacking them. Maybe some people are disillusioned from the world. Maybe they just want to tap out for a while and going home and putting a wig on and jerking off his fucking what they're into. You know, that's the beauty of what we do. That everybody's into something fucking different. I understand somebody going to a, to a porn store or every

Speaker 4:          00:17:17       day because I go to the weed store every day. So what's the fucking difference? Corals and correlation thing to me, pointing to me is fascinating because um, like porn girls, like there's like a huge number of huge percentage of them who have had a bad things happen to them when they're kids. You know, a lot of traumatic like sexual type shit and it's not all of them, but it's a lot of them. And so you get to look at and go, this is crazy. Like this is a whole industry that was in

Speaker 3:          00:17:50       many ways because of abuse. And then that industry is, is something that feeds, you know, through these online videos while he's over millions and billions at people. But we're all supposed to like feel bad about it. It's all, it's a weird sort of undercover, creepy thing. You know, you couldn't go into business meetings and talk about your favorite porn sites. You know, you can't just go there and like, what are you guys doing? You still going to youporn you fucking noobs you know, hey come on, you got to check out, you know, x, Y, z up your ass videos.com or you know, all Asians or whatever the fuck WWE website it is. There's like 100,000 like free porn websites online. But you can't talk about him. Everybody goes to work and they just kind of, yeah, if you brought it up you could get in trouble. Like if you shared that information with someone that you work with, you know, if like go like, wait, what sites do you go to? Oh, you know, I'm mostly like a fashion and babies sides and well, what's, what sites do you go to?

Speaker 5:          00:18:50       Have you been, have you been, he fucked, I think it's called [inaudible]. It's e. F. U. C. K. T. What does it, it's, it's just like fucked up porn videos. You know, it's kind of like old style project, but that kind of field. But like, you know, the first one is, uh, this girl who's 18 has a whole hand in her vagina and getting fucked in the ass at the same time. If you just look at the front page and all the crazy videos. But anyways, that's my new favorite porn shit. It's just the abuse porn is very strange.

Speaker 3:          00:19:24       And so what I was saying about watching like porn from like the 70s and the 80s, they just had sex. That's all they did. I mean they got together and then they had sex like porn of today. It's like there's some really nutty things they're doing, man. You know, this little bottle like choking and gagging and you know, it's fucking spitting on each other, spitting in mouth and

Speaker 5:          00:19:46       stuff. When we were in Ohio, me and Jodie is wearing in Ohio. I was over at my friend Shane's house cause he had a baby and she was showing me like he got the playboy of the month and year that he, uh, was born like that the issue, which was like in 1974 and there was this person on there that uh, the, the, the centerfold was the most beautiful woman ever. And I'm like obsessed with her now. Her name is, uh, Maryland Lang. It's M, a R, I, L Y N, Lang La. And Gee, what are you doing? You Stalker? No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Yeah. Right. But, but she, it was before, you know, implants, like it was so weird seeing, seeing like playboy that that was always used to be all natural women curves and boobs and stuff become like all bleach blonde, early eighties. Right. Was it early eighties, late seventies? I don't know. But Lazy. When you look at the evolution of the tip, if you really look at a playboy from 1969, you'll go, wow, even the fucking nipples more rounded. They will

Speaker 4:          00:20:48       point the uh, you know, it's really weird when a woman looks like we've had this discussion before about the women of the 70 [inaudible], you know, that way would the crazy one that Steve McQueen was married to Ali McGraw, I shouldn't call it crazy. It was not for the smack that down set, but it's just you see those women and you see the women down. It's, I dunno, I dunno if there's a difference. I Dunno. Maybe. Well I think it's more exercise today and plastic surgery for sure. And plastic surgery. And so it's weird where like unnatural looking tits are normal. Like it's really an animal behind you. She busted the scene. She really damn anything. Pamela Anderson really, and everybody in this room says, yeah, she's gross. But at one time you did look at this bitch and say she's hot. She's hot. It was fucking that picture.

Speaker 4:          00:21:34       No, she's not as fun. It is weird that we're looking at, those aren't really her tits with those are water bags under the skin. There's a big surgical incision. They stuffed water bags under her skin and it stretches it out to make like the nipples extend further and make the whole thing well unnaturally tight and you know, and swollen. It's really kind of fucking crazy. But you could tell humans beings, you could tell she's got good policy for sure, but how we'll show wago post how weird fake tits. They're weird as fuck man. It's a crazy thing. I think that's a fake nipple or button. No, that's a button silly Billy that says place to perfect. Oh, you shut your pie. Yeah. She probably know when it comes to Paul and I don't really, when I worked in captain video, I worked at a video store and Aspen, Colorado for a while and they used to have like pulling in those days, those sections, they had 12 boxes, you know what I'm saying?

Speaker 4:          00:22:30       Like a video store had to be six releases. One of those releases within Olin sisters and I brought him home and get coked out with my girlfriends have in Berlin and Georgia led the Lynn Lynn [inaudible] and then the other one was when that girl was busted onto the scene, the one that was 14 and they let her find that she was 13 and like I seen her movies. Which are you talking about Tracy Lord? Yeah, I think she was 14 she was 18 there's one video that you can get I think where she's 18 well she did one called Tracy does Japan takes a fucking doctor, puts up a fucking pussy. Come on. Mama Fried. Yes. She was fucking crazy. I don't think you're going to look it up. I'll look it up. Tracy does Tokyo. Why wouldn't you? Don't forget shit like that. You know I got to find out about course she was the, I don't think so because they were all trying to live up to the led Zeppelin thing, but Tracy does Seattle. They shoved a shark up some chick's pussy in Seattle during an orgy dog. Why Little Baby Shark? He has that ball was the real bill though. Check one of the freaking list and less freak motherfucker till a couple of books. Oh Man, I got to see this. But Tracy did Tokyo. There's an intro.

Speaker 2:          00:23:46       You have to get it. You got to get the original fucking cut, the whole thing. But Tracy does. Tokyo was when she went on and that was the last fall. Anything about octopus upper girls. It's not going to just say, you know what I'm saying? It's not going to tell you. She'd get to this toilet and she puts it up a wiggles. And I remember sitting in that room because I used to, you know how in those days you always had a movie on and the video store, I was so crazy. I put a fucking boner and when people were killing it with kids, I turn it the fuck off. You know, I was living in another fucking dimension then. So I remember pulling an island, go look at this guys. And I thought it was disgusting. You know, I wasn't that into that much. All that crazy. And this dog. My experience is, it's Boogie nights. This movies online, the parts of it that aren't, aren't sex or online. This is a wild fucking movie. You know? I ain't got to drop the bullshit. No one. Whenever I come in and drop fucked up knowledge, I don't know nothing about point Tracy. Tracy Lourdes was like 16 and look at those pictures she's doing just hardcore, hard fucking core hard.

Speaker 1:          00:24:50       God, I got an idea. Let's buy the movie and I'll masturbate in front of each other to it on the podcast.

Speaker 3:          00:24:55       Isn't it crazy that you can say that there's something wrong, but what she did, there's something wrong. It's crazy mean. She obviously knew how to fuck. She obviously looked like she should be getting fucked.

Speaker 1:          00:25:08       Right. All of the above. All the pieces were in place. Would you think that the numbers get fucked up? I mean, if you, if she was just a fucking garage, Jamba juice, you probably wouldn't think that. I think, you know, she obviously wears a lot of makeup and her video, that was 30 years ago, those head cuts,

Speaker 3:          00:25:25       if you saw her when she was, you know, with no makeup at 16 dressed like a 16 year old, you'd probably go, oh, that's like a young kid. Yeah. But it's like that little Ramsey. It's a weird thing where it's like what? What is the right year like? And no one agrees. Like some countries it's like 16 some parts of the world is 13 some parts of this country, I think it might be like really young, you know, like whatever the age of consent is. I think most of them are leaning towards at least 17 as a, as a parrot. And those, when you had sex at your age, how old were you when the first time in a fucking pussy. See what are you ready? Where you really fucking ready? I'm talking to you man to man when you're ready. Yeah, I was okay.

Speaker 3:          00:26:04       I mean I handled it. It wasn't that big a deal. But I think for kids, you know, for kids fucking around with kids there's a different age. You know like you can say the age of consent is 18 and if the age of consent is 18 that's that, you know, that makes sense to me because I mean 17 year olds can still make out with each other. You know like there should be like an age buffer where like an 18 year old boyfriend who's been with a girl since they were 16 and 14 should still be allowed to banger. Like once he turns 19 like they'd been boyfriend and girlfriend for three years. You know what I'm saying? Like why can't they bang anymore just because he hit some magic number and she hasn't hit it yet. That doesn't make any sense to me. Then there is a lot of that.

Speaker 4:          00:26:44       It's a lot of banging at 14 it was a loud bang. The 14 bang on a 15 [inaudible] 14 I stopped some titties. You know where you ready for a lot of hand job? Well you fucking ready for it was that, you know the girl I was doing all that shit with. This was kind of a thought. As I looked at her Facebook page, she wasn't ready to see my Cuba. I grow it fucking 14 and then then you'd have to refer to yourself as a parent. What age do I think my son or my daughter is ready to fuck around? The question is what age can a man fuck your daughter? That's the real question. That's the real question because it's not, can a 16 year old boy fucking 16 year old girl? Yeah, of course they can. Can a 17 year old boy fucking 16 year old girl? I guess so. Can an 18 year old boy fuck a 16 year old girl. Yeah. If she's been sure, can a 19 year old guy fuck a 16 year old girl know can a 20 year old and then you know what I'm saying? Or he gets, it starts getting exponentially.

Speaker 5:          00:27:40       Who's the judge of that? Somebody in Kentucky probably thinks it's completely different like it's seven

Speaker 4:          00:27:46       40 yeah. There should be, you know, some sort of a standard. But I mean at a certain point in time I go to just got to let it go. What are you ready? Look at your kids around you. You, whenever I meet people that have kids, I always ask the parents, how old are the kids? What'd they say to me? He's 14 I go to, I look at that person. I go, look at that kid at that age I was already doing a thousand things. What a shame. Cause I wasn't ready for that. What she, yeah, but you had a wild life. Doesn't matter. 14. You should not be hanging out with guys robbing a train, you know? Uh, I would say the cycle of true. How you should not be doing a lot of things at 14. Yeah, I have the, I stop and think about some shit that I did not have some apps, a fucking loot.

Speaker 4:          00:28:34       We have 15 I shouldn't have found somebody on the floor dead. I shouldn't have done a lot. You know what I'm saying? I handled a lot at that age. I look at these kids and like, oh, that's 15 wow. At that age I had already mug somebody a role, the drunk, I'd done something, you know what I'm saying? It's something to look over and you go, fuck, either I liked this or I don't, you know, a shock like trace blood do they like or he does it. I remember hanging out on the street at night as like a 13 or 14 year old, you know, I remember like we just be out on the street on the summer. We'd be playing in the street. It'd be like midnight or something, you know, and we just be out. No one does that. No you can't do that. No cop would pull you over copper to pull over and go, you have a curfew at 10 got to be in. Where's your parents drive you home?

Speaker 5:          00:29:17       We would just say like, Hey, I'm going to spend the night at my friend's house and Mri frame and say, yeah, we're gonna spend the night. But we had a protest and they, the parents don't want to fucking talk to her like a babysitter for the night. We get the fuck out of him on the couch. You know you guys were

Speaker 4:          00:29:28       mosquito bites and your Dick, right? Remember mosquitoes man. Yeah. Do we don't get that in la? People don't realize how fucking conti mosquitoes can be when you go out into the woods and they just swarm on your ass.

Speaker 5:          00:29:41       I got bit in the face

Speaker 3:          00:29:42       when I was in Ohio from right here. Regionally. Yeah. Off don't work no more. We talked about this shit off that shit. They power through those mosquitoes. They drink that shift from mouthwash. He got ahold of some Monsanto corn. They were fucking super pumped up. Dude. My Dad was telling me about that. This bug that came from Japan and that's then hit, uh, I think Canada and then went to Michigan and now it's coming down to Ohio and it's going, what it's doing is, is it's, well, it's not bad for us, but it goes into these trees. I forget the name of the tree that like, uh, that it's attacking and it, it, uh, drills, holes in it and lays eggs in it. And then when all the babies come out, they just pretty much destroyed everything. So it's killing this whole breeding the tree bark beetle?

Speaker 3:          00:30:25       No, it's something something I've never heard of in in and it's just destroying all the, my dad has had these trees for 30 years in his backyard. He's humongous trees. They're all dead. And he's like, dude, they're all the trees in the neighborhood are dead. Like it's just attacking Ohio right now. And it when it was in Michigan before, how do they stop it? They can't. They can to pretreat a tree. Like you could have these people come out to your tree, a tree and put this shit in it and they drill these holes in the tree and put it like this chemical on the tree that supposedly helps it, but it's, it didn't work for my dad. And like all that he had all his trees treated and it's just destroying all these trees. That's insane. Yeah. That's fucked man. Isn't it weird how like now, because of all the cross pollination, which ships and planes and the weekend introduce shit to a place where it has no natural predators and that the whole system just gets completely fucked.

Speaker 3:          00:31:17       I was on the, um, the, not a, not even the highway. It was on like a regular streets last night at about 10 o'clock. And as I'm driving down the street, I saw this fucking coyote standing in the road staring at me and then he trots over to the sidewalk and then I slowed down and I look at him and he's staring at me and he looks left and it looks like, and then he runs, it runs up into someone's driveway. And I'm looking at that kind of like that mother, if that's reality, that's nature. That's something that doesn't know traffic lights doesn't give a fuck about your laws, doesn't give a fuck about, you know, the, Oh, that's your kid. Oh, I won't, I won't fuck with your kid. You know this, it's a crazy little monster or an around eating. Cat's eating rabbits, killing things all around people's homes. And that's, that's, that's reality. That thing's going to be here long after these buildings rot away and nuclear waste makes people evacuate, you know, everything west of Pasadena, you know, I mean once that actually happens with things like that actually happen,

Speaker 5:          00:32:16       there's a gang of code, there's a gang of coyotes that live in Burbank and I have this thing where I, I feel weird with coyotes cause I don't feel like they're going to attack me at all even though they might sometime. But I always rolled down the window and fuck with coyotes. Like I'll whistle and be like, hey, you know, like, like do you play with the coyotes

Speaker 3:          00:32:34       dogs? But you're going to see a picture of a coyote with her mouth open. Yeah. It's scary fucking nuts man. They look like cartoon mouse like their mouths have. So like take it, pull up a picture of one coyote mouth open, big teeth something Google asshole. Um, but Ho asshole, whatever you want to put in the um, um, the, the extra like extra teeth that they have are really fucking anything. Set this picture out.

Speaker 6:          00:33:01       Jesus. We can always fucking teeth. Look at that. Look in his fucking teeth. That's so scary.

Speaker 3:          00:33:11       That's really fucked up when you think about that young girl that got killed by coyotes. It's so rare that that happens, but it can have a little kids get bitten by them all the time, but usually little kids are near their parents. So usually what happens is like the dad comes over, beats the fuck out of the coyote and the coyote. Let's go. Like it's happened a few times, uh, in recent memory, but fucking this chick was just walking through the woods and a whole gang of them circled her. I just said we can take her and just jacked her killed by coyotes. Ooh, that's gruesome.

Speaker 5:          00:33:42       Yeah. The gang in my neighborhood just hangs out around my fence. Like I'll let my dog will come out and go to the bathroom and you could just hear like, like it. My dog started barking and then you just see all these feet scattering around my fence. Like, oh, these coyotes are going to try to attack my, my dog if they can do it.

Speaker 3:          00:33:58       Knowing the coyotes can attack people like that. I say we kill all of them when people are like, no, these are our friends. Do you know they killed a mountain lion in Santa Monica? Do you know about that? I heard about that. Were you go on Joe Diaz

Speaker 5:          00:34:14       is coyote could eaten like can you eat a coyote? Cause what if we can make it some kind of Coyote Berg?

Speaker 3:          00:34:18       I bet you could eat it if you had to eat it, but it tastes like shit. I've had it tastes like hatred. A big coyote meat just tastes like rotten hatred. Yes.

Speaker 6:          00:34:31       Coyote brain. That's like crazy

Speaker 3:          00:34:36       Auntie fucking animals. Kylie's are so they killed this mountain lions and Sandy and um, uh, Santa Monica and like where everybody is second Monica populated area. And it wasn't a homeless person. No. So fucking mountain lion. It was a real mount line, not a cougar and not a crazy old bitch. And um, when, when they killed it, there was all these Facebook posts and one of them was my favorite. It was so awesome. There's this woman and she said, why are w w it's only because of our ego that we think we are better than animals. You know, animals have a soul and she like, you know, soul in all caps. I would gladly take a bullet for an animal or a dog or a cat or a bear or a deer before I would for a person. Exclamation point, exclamation point. I mean, I was, I was looking at this, I'm like, this is amazing. Like this is a, this is a person that's actually saying you shouldn't kill that monster that's roaming through the neighborhood, the 150 pound cat. Now you shouldn't kill that unpredictable beast. And if you wanted to do that, I would gladly take that bullet. I would sacrifice my life for this monster. You sacrifice your life for one of the most horrific creations of nature of big cat mean thoughtless killing machine that you can't even roll a basketball in front of one of those things. They fucking dive on and bite it. That's their instinct.

Speaker 2:          00:36:04       Yeah. But they could have also done that as a weapon. Just like, Hey, get away from me cat here to chase this ball and all this technology. They can pull one of those bullets and put them to sleep and take them to the zoo. I figured out what's going on and kill fucking everything. Yeah, I do. I do think that kill everything in the stand up there is it as a harmful animal, whatever, but something made that bed come down that bed. I'm gonna fucking nobody. We don't want to fuck with him. Right. So we did a building somewhere. They shouldn't be fucking building or there's no food for the fucking bed. It's most likely. No,

Speaker 3:          00:36:36       and it's also the problem with bears and people is that once they find out that they can go to garbage cans and get food, that's it. They just threw the garbage cans all the time. Then they have to take them and put them in zoos and shit. They become, yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:36:47       I understand. You have to protect the community. We can't have a bear or a fucking mountain line. Does anybody know what a mountain lion will do to you? Him being and how fast. But at the same time. Let's see if we could fucking mummify him first. Take him to a museum. Figure out what made this fucking Mama. She one of those guards on them that we have. You got something on your list when we have darts and lasers, laser lasers and dark running under one o one backwards and he gets shot. Darden. What the fuck? You got these dark squawk. You got dark officer's Darla laser room. You talk about them. You show them the Chuck Norris movie. Now you're on the one on one and you don't want a dark nobody. You follow me? We're a little bit to Taser and people's dangerous. We're a little bit too quick.

Speaker 2:          00:37:32       We're a little bit too quick to pull the fucking trigger. I loved the, I loved the fucking, you know, bearing arms and everything, but it's a bear. Anybody who knows hunting or whatever, just sit still for two minutes and get the fuck out of here. Get the fuck out of there. You, you kicked the garbage can that more skeletal us until we fucking corner. You know, I, let me just fucking ask them what they were everywhere they were. You gotta be real careful. I gotta be real careful with it, but I seen it a lot now. I used to see schools are raccoons schools and I'm crossing the street from the big ones, the little tiny one at the end. I know those motherfuckers are dangerous, but you can't hit them with a car. Let them be.

Speaker 3:          00:38:09       I wish I saved a picture. There's a picture that I saw once, uh, I don't remember if it was online or in a book or a magazine. I wish I saved this picture cause I haven't been able to find it and all my Google searches. But it was a guy who was a photographer. It was killed by a bear and he was taking pictures of a female and her cubs. And the last image on his camera before he was killed by the bear is the bear with its teeth glared charging them. And it's a fucking horrific

Speaker 1:          00:38:36       picture. They found it. They found it on the dude's camera, but it is, I don't remember looking at it and thinking back on your business when they shot Jim Jones and they camera man went down. I remember the camera kept running as they was shooting everybody as we got on a plane from Guyana that was live footage, the ad on television. What the fuck were you doing in Guyana? You should've been taking pictures of San Francisco where you live. That Jim Jones story. Remember that shit? They shot him at the airport.

Speaker 3:          00:39:02       What was the dude's name? Who did, who played him in the movie powers booth. Ooh. Bad mother fucker for certain things. Oh my God. He comes out and when, when you need a heavy southern gentlemen throwing heat and you always booths are bad. Motherfucker.

Speaker 1:          00:39:18       Look at the screen here. Is this the, for some reason the image isn't showing up, but it says the images captures at bear seconds before it's mod two. It's photonics falls.

Speaker 3:          00:39:29       Well, I think you're thinking of a different picture though. The, the, the one, the, they're thinking of one where it's, I'm a bear comes into a guy's tent. I think that's a different image. Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:39:42       What's up Joe Rogan Baby? Nothing, man. What's going on? See if we could find that you're very excited about this series and one fake one though. A fake one where they showed the photo shop to go with you. I was going to be, this is a great fucking card rate card. It's going to be sick. Just some great college coming up to the next few fucking weeks to dos Santos and Frank Mir scoby nuts. I was going to ask you to remember this. Salvia gay, that was the crazy MMA guy that was always talking about, not Salvia, but Stevia. Stevia. I know that whole story. Yeah, I dunno. Probably shouldn't talk about it. Yeah, don't give him any attention. Something's wrong with them. Maybe it was. Break it down. I'm very excited for you. Sorry, I can't go. Yeah, we should it go be fun.

Speaker 3:          00:40:27       I want them. I watched one with you guys. We've got to go to a strike force. Correct. Next time. It was a big strike force fight. Did you see? Yeah. The last one. Did you see Josh Barnett and Daniel Cormier? Ooh, what a fight. Both guys broke their hands in the first round to look very good. It's a beast. He's a fucking voice. Takes a, launched Josh Barnett into the air to Josh's point. It is a big boy. He's a big Daniel Cormier. Hoisted him up and Whoa, boom. Threw him for a ride, control them on top, smashed him, cut him up with elbows. He's a, and he's only had like, I think that was his fifth that, I mean, it's amazing. Tenure Karma is a motherfucker is out of the baby face assassin. He's been around forever. He was a old, one of the youngest UFC champs. He won, I don't know how old he was when he won the title, but I remember he beat, he beat Randy couture. And then there was some sort of a dispute with the UFC, you know, management and UFC didn't get along. And he laughed. And then he started fighting overseas and he fought in pride and you know, and then he came back and it became part of the strike force tournament, you know? But he's been around forever and he's that guy he's fought. He's, yeah, he's fought. Minotauro is fought cro cop twice. You know, he's, he's filed a lot of fucking dudes.

Speaker 4:          00:41:40       I just thought his experience would really shine through. But for call that mother Fucker, man, well you know Josh Barnett, Bro,

Speaker 3:          00:41:46       his hand the first round. And so the core me Yang, they both broke their hand the first round. So, uh, you know, who knows how a rematch with girl, but call me a won that fight with his wrestling. He won that fight with his striking. I mean, he's just a mother fucker dude. And he's not been doing it that long and he's, he's bad ass man. I haven't been really praised. The head kicked Josh Barnett twice. That's what you know. And Josh Ran, I couldn't take them down. No one's to be able to take them down in, in a UFC match. I mean, he's such a high level wrestler. It's going to take a fucking beast to take that guy down, you know? And so you got to stand with him and he's really quick man. And he's not a tall guy, but he's like compact and explosive, you know? And that all the years of wrestling, that high level wrestling, I think the mental toughness that those guys gain from

Speaker 4:          00:42:38       high school. Yeah, he was amateur wrestling's and there's a different animals, man. Those are different animals there. Those guys are tough on a whole different level. They're like, in my opinion, that maybe the tea all like in camp, you know, you tell, you look at just the percentage that might be the toughest group of human beings on earth. Just the toughest mentally toughest is amateur wrestlers. It really might be. They're fucking animals, man. Those guys, some of this shit, those guys go through it and they do a dehydrated and malnourished and they're, they're out there like fucking animals. You know what's crazy though? You went to the UFC in Jersey and he has all these MMA fighters. The audience say that, but everybody kept looking at that Penn state fucking wrestling team and everybody kept looking at that coach war people went up to shake that motherfucker's hand.

Speaker 4:          00:43:27       I heard more people go small. It is, what's his name? You think coach a Penn state. That's the best wrestler in the world. Oh, Cael Sanderson, who was at the fight right in the row behind me. And he's wrestling again. No. Yeah. I think if I, I don't know if it's the same guy, we're thinking about that. What do they say is the best wrestler in the world? Yeah. He's an amazing I fucking two years guy. Even not something that you're like, oh, I'm not going to mess with him. Very, he was sitting behind this with the team at everybody who walked by had a say, oh my God, there's channel Sanderson, all cael this, oh my God. Like everybody was fucking like in awe of this guy. And that was when we threw the guy out. And then the guy that was with him said to me, Joey Karate, we got your back. That's when it all went down because the guy was yelling, but everybody was looking at that guy, like he was a fucking killer that day. And I mean, from fixed to Guido, everybody was there standing there, you know? So yeah. He's the coach at Penn state. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's Cael Sanderson. Yeah, he's a beast. It's crazy. His, um, his, the, the, the people that, uh, he was wrestling with

Speaker 3:          00:44:32       like teaching in college. They're the ones who encouraged them to compete again, he's still physically got it. He just stopped competing. I just think like that high a level, like when you're at that high a level in any sport, whether it's wrestling or anything, you know, boxing, when you get to that level, it's so hard to maintain that kind of pace. It's so hard to just live your life like that where you're constantly coming.

Speaker 2:          00:44:54       Painting, when I was a kid, I see the high school wrestling or the way you were fucking voices just creeping me out with a cause that you or him, when I was a kid, I see the most of the best fights ever. I seen a high school decorated wrestler fight this kid that was a scrappy fighter or Billy Lou dog, two minutes and he got his hooks in this motherfucker. It was in front of the VFW. You know how they always have an American flag with a pole? There's a little fence. He picked him up and threw them over the fucking fence dog. Oh No, the strike, I didn't know. He just landed on his head. He just took to it like, what am I going to do? God, I'm not going to get back up or fight this fucking month. So just pick up. And that's when I was like, restless, got something. They got that core strength they'd been working on since they were young. And some of these guys with the bent knee isn't shit. They ain't got no time to fuck around man. They'll take you the fuck down. But it has made a difference in him. It may that I've seen, I don't know much about it. I, I, you know, I watched a little bit of pride, but in the UFC you've seen these wrestlers that makes a big impact. Judo guys and the wrestler,

Speaker 3:          00:45:50       that's the, that's the, those are the two toughest to deal with. But the thing about a, you know, and both of them, you know, especially when it comes to international competition, they both have to deal with some pretty fucking stiff and crazy competition, you know. But judo internationally, especially as you know, really popular, it's a really popular sport. And a lot of different countries, but wrestling, there's something about wrestlers man, that, that, that what they have to go through, their mind becomes capable of pulling shit off that other where other people wouldn't push hard enough. They would, they would just, they would back off before the wrestler does. You know, these guys, red line in man, they know how to read line their brain, their body, you know, some of the most savage fighters of all time. Dan Henderson, Randy Coture, you know, go through the lineup. All the, the Matt Hughes, think about all the different guys that started off Koscheck the, all the different guys who started off Hendrick.

Speaker 2:          00:46:40       Yeah. Rashad. Rashad, yeah, absolutely. The lest of John Fitch was a captain at Purdue. The list is a, and it takes a while for the hands to catch up with everything else. But some guys picking right up, uh, Griffin. What's the name of fabulous? Phil was the one who just fought Rashad before. Phil Davis. So Davis, I'm sorry. Yeah, fabulous. Whatever they call him. Mr. Wonderful. What's the one before fall? It's just, you know, a lot of evil that he always said that you better get ready for these wrestlers and learn how to fight off your back cause he's rest is gonna fucking take you down. You know. So there's so many guys that become successful. If you started with the Japanese cultural center in Hollywood, no one is close to Eddie's. It's a couple blocks from the old uh, legends. The one on the Vermont and one that just moved the culture of some of the, it's like where the Japanese go to practice judo in town

Speaker 4:          00:47:30       and it's real dirt cheap. It's hardwood floors. It's all old school. Some people go sign up one time and get the fuck out of that cause it's very traditional and they didn't really do two classes a week, but it's going on down there. All these other things like high kido on labrea with the swords and shit. The gun I'm talking about down on a and they'd been there since 1940 something. Is there something that Keough school in Hollywood? No, they moved to Burbank and then they moved again. I drive by on Magnolia and I seen everything is in Burbank. Any style that you want is in Burbank martial arts. I went to see that. He's uh, I went to Burbank last night. I had to go outside, swung by Eddie's, I counted six fucking karate schools, kickboxing. Uh, the kicker. Oh who's the other guy though?

Speaker 4:          00:48:14       That we are all fabulous. Benny Benny the jet has in school, I mean Burbank catnap the martial arts hall of fame. Then the Jetson Burbank now, but in the Jetson Burbank man, they got a new kid kickboxer school. They got to Gracie virus. Yeah. When I used to Mexico, when I first moved here, man, I used to go to his place in Van Hise. He would have all these gang bangers that they would give a free classes too and let them work out. And you know, you'd be like taking kickboxing classes, but this is funny gang bangers man. It was, there was, there was some parts of it that were kind of creepy and a lot of people were complaining about it cause there was like a few problems. But I remember this one dude came in and he had a tattoo on his back that look like you drew it, you know, and it said, whatever the, it was like vodka or something like that, fuck the rest.

Speaker 4:          00:48:59       And he had it tattooed on his back. Wow. I mean, it was like look like you did, or like anybody gave you a tattoo gun for the first time and said, well, just see what you could do. And I was, I was thinking like, this is not a guy you want to punch in the face. This is not a guy who has a lot to lose. Like, you know, this is, uh, this is Mike. I might want to just keep my hands up and sticking mood. Might want to just get in your car and get the fuck. Yeah. Well there's, there was a, he had, there was, you know, Benny the jet and then he, I think he had, um, uh, family members that would also teach there too. I forgot. I forgot the whole history of it, so I don't want to talk about it. But they had a lot of, uh, there were a lot, a lot of gang bangers car there. It was a big culture shock thing coming from a, coming from New York and then moving here and then taking kickboxing with gangbangers. All right, fuck that.

Speaker 5:          00:49:49       Remember that? Remember that bug we were talking about earlier that is counting on this trees. It's cut an emerald ash borer and look at that. It looks like a, a cricket at a disco. I mean it's, it's scary looking. Looks High Tech looks like a robot cricket. Yeah, it's like a Nissan Gtr bug and nothing does. That's the thing that just goes into trees and fucking lays a bunch of eggs and trees that destroys that. The trees and then those things hatch and become more of these. It's like a fucking army of tree killers. That's so funny. Fucking

Speaker 4:          00:50:18       nutty man. Yeah. It's so weird. So what do we have to do? Bring over like Komodo dragons eight these fucking, doesn't that look like alien technology that that's take alien technology. Got nothing to do it. No.

Speaker 2:          00:50:28       You know what's going to happen? We going to fucking, dude, come on. This has been going on for years. We started with termites. What do you expect from here of the fuck? I'm just saying this started years ago with termites. They eat trees, they eat the roots. I know to you, but it is new when it have been invasive species waiting, when we know we're bring them weeded through cup with Miami. Wait, that was coming in and those fucking bags, right? I think we're just waiting. Life's and fucking bugs and Palmetto bugs or snakes with this couple of those fucking shipments, you know, big nine foot fucking Cobra got in from some fucking Columbia jungle. You think this and that. And they got Dick's and they look for ears and they always fucking, creeks is 2013 going to have a new fucking creature every week. And I'm about to smoke my little vapor so I'll get the master motherfucking cushions. I was smoking the shit on the plane or it's tremendous.

Speaker 5:          00:51:17       You know what's so funny? He was smoking on the plane next to an old lady and I did. We talked about this yesterday and w and I'm like, wow, that's crazy. I guess you know, I guess you can do, probably is not against the law to do those things. You know, vapor. If it was like an electronic cigarette I guess. But then, then he did it in a car when we're driving to Pittsburgh and he just starts hitting it and all the windows are up and immediately smelled weed. And I'm like, if you did that on the plane, everybody smelled that. It does smell like

Speaker 2:          00:51:44       we'd still a suction thing. Right? If you blow it can have a vacuum. So when you blow it over your shoulder to the window to the left. But I was smoking on two different flights. Nobody smells. None about pot smoke man. That when you're

Speaker 3:          00:52:04       smoking, it doesn't smell like anything. It's the weirdest thing. No, it's just like cigarettes. Will you? Yeah, I bet it is. Just like you don't smell the smell smoke on your own body. Well that's a weird thing that they say about smells that all factory senses, they only detect changes. So like you can get used to a stinky town. That's how people live. If they live like someplace, it has like a male or something like that, but yeah, yeah, that that could do it or I'm a think slaughterhouses. That's a real problem. How poop? Cow Pie. Yeah. If you pass like pastures and cows are shitting all over the place and just stinks horribly fucked up. They shit so much. It's just shit everywhere. Oh yeah. Drive by to shit. You're smelling and shit.

Speaker 5:          00:52:44       Yeah. I go to my mom's house. I have to go buy like a good half mile where the whole like air is just shit smell. It smells like a thousand poops.

Speaker 3:          00:52:51       It's nature telling you that this is dirty. You don't want to eat anything anywhere near this. That's like a big warning sign. That's why shit smells terrible.

Speaker 2:          00:53:02       Right? Oh fucking though. What do you want her? I don't think you should.

Speaker 3:          00:53:07       Well, that thing on a plane and I'm going to make you promise that you're not going to do that from now on.

Speaker 5:          00:53:12       And he got caught with it at an airport. He

Speaker 2:          00:53:15       did a bank, took it out, looked at it. They couldn't even figure it out. Those fucking geniuses. So the Capo, when they gave it right back to me and I was puffing all the way to the gate. Number three, like a doctor,

Speaker 4:          00:53:26       what did you say it was when they electric cigarette. Oh, didn't even ask. How's that one for you? Didn't even ask. They didn't even ask. They just looked at it. They want to know if it was like some sort of a gene Simmons bomb from one of those movies such whenever the thing, a little while. But Rutger Hauer gimme the bonus. Fuck the bonus. They pulled the thing. I might think just the fat seen the movie's horrible, but that seeing this fucking listen man. How many movies did Gene Simmons do? I don't know why. I know he played that and I showed them on an episode of Miami Vice One time. That's it. I never seen him, but he's probably done a bunch of fucking movies. He was on an episode of Miami Vice. Yeah, he played like a drug dealer was shot Miami Vice changed the fucking game.

Speaker 4:          00:54:10       Dude started wearing blazers and no socks. They started wearing loafers with no socks. Why? Because that's what they wore in Miami. Vice one to be like, you're in Miami. Do start buying white cars. Fuck. Bought a white car before 1980 there's was white cars. Get out of here. What your stupid fucking white car. How many white Corvettes or do you see? This is like 10 of them ever made white seems white whites only for like Honda at courts or something and they saw that white Testarossa. They went, oh shit. Did you see will white wheels too? You see will Smith is slap that dude. Yeah, that's crazy. And then he lied. He's like tried to kiss me in the mouth. I'm like, Hey, we can all see the video. He didn't try to kiss you in the mouth. Kisses face a few times. He might've been trying to kiss them, you know, in the mouth.

Speaker 4:          00:54:53       It might've been like some polling or I didn't think about that. I don't like that either. Bad slap them. You know, he, he barely touched me and he just went like this and the guy's face and everybody's saying that it was like some assault. Oh my God. And out of here it's like always at publicity. He's up at events with somebody at the longest shot thing, so at least said something to fucking Burt Reynolds and Burt rose bushes. Listen, he's 66 years old. He was just trying to get publicity for the fucking movie, you know what I'm saying? Probably not even, I suppose as ego guy came over and said something was just like, did you see the original one got goes? No. Burt Reynolds smack them. Really, really? Whoa. That online is that, oh you got to see Max guy run smack the fight. The Burt Reynolds is one of those guys where I look at him and I kind of feel bad, you know?

Speaker 4:          00:55:43       And I see like his face all stretched out. Like when I was a kid, I looked at Burt, run onto my tech guys. This shit like I remember like smokey and the bandit, he's always smiling. That's what I would always think. Like this guy looks like he's always having a great time to have a good sub to marry Loni Anderson that fucked him. I shot him down and left the with pills and he was willing, but dog, you watch them even to the longest shot at the beginning of the longest yard. He goes in, he beats the bitch. Bitch, the bitch. Watch the movie. He gets in the car and what fucking songs does he get out when it turns it on Saturday night? Special Leopard skin. Watch it. So fuck. He's got a Valora jacket on with fucking patches of the she. They look like a

Speaker 2:          00:56:24       fucking, he looks like the guy that played superfly. That's what he looks like in that movie. Smack. So he's laying in bed. She's giving him a hard time. He smacks her. He takes her fucking car. Saturday night special drives, it cuts off. Cops, takes it to the ocean and dumps into the ocean. Then goes to the bar and they come get them at the bar and they start fucking around. He beats the one cop up. Then they take them to Burt Reynolds was the shit. Here's us. Here's the video.

Speaker 7:          00:56:50       Burt Reynolds apparently got little slap happy last night. QBS producer at a movie premiere and Chelsea, and we're the only ones with the video was Michael Palmer on here now with the a blow by blow, Michael Maurice Reynolds attending the premiere of his new film, really a remake of his old pill and the longest yard when neither in jest or an anger, depending on who you believe. Reynold slap the CVS employee who was asking the star about that movie and today she'd be as new says it is looking into the matter. You judge for yourself.

Speaker 8:          00:57:21       I don't know anything about it. I liked the guy.

Speaker 2:          00:57:53       The audio is produces. Nobody knows a smack like the dude who got smacked up 2020 by the wrestler. It's a punk with that little backhand backhanded gave the dude that wrestler when he fucking smacked, what's his name? Tom? Something like that boy got up, but he fucking smack them with a hand. That was a smack Wilson make giving this guy a fucking loved that. Oh Will Smith did was go touch the guy with his fingers on his face. Anybody who calls what will Smith did a slap. He gently did this to the guy's face. It was like, so it was so non aggressive. Yeah. This guy's a fucking huge dude.

Speaker 1:          00:58:41       That's terrific. That all you got. I asked you the standard questions. Standard questions. I think at this bank you're going to get bike. There you go. What the Hell is wrong with you? That's the open hand slap. You think it's thinking

Speaker 2:          00:59:01       after the fucking real guys, that dude cough to cough as a guy not getting paid enough to do his job well, you know, it's also the way he said it was very arrogant. Like he was going to be safe. I think it's fake know it's not, you know, saying it's fake de fucking Duh. Everyone knows it's, you know,

Speaker 3:          00:59:22       it's, it's, it's obviously planned out in advance, but to say it's not a tough job. You're crazy. Those guys are always busted up. Those guys are always, they get hooked on pain stuff. What they did the exam wrestling on 2020 and they showed us all the tricks, how they would take the razor blade and cut. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And make it bleed. Bleed. That was a great Exposito. A lot of people that know about that shit. Imagine they did that. They used to cut their own hair and I knew about it because one of the training schools in New Jersey, so when I was going to grab the school and the teachers kept telling me, if you're good guys, we'll take it to the wrestling. I know chief Jay Strongbow, whatever, it's all fake and shut up. When I found that wrestling was faking the fourth grade, I was pissed for about 10 minutes.

Speaker 3:          01:00:00       I went to El tap patio the other day and they had the Mexican wrestling on those due to have some fucking dope moves, man about the outfits. The outfits are outstanding dudes with like long Conan here. No one looks like they've ever even heard of steroids. It's so weird because steroids are legal in Mexico and these dudes are like regular looking dude, but they had some crazy moves. I'm just like really impressed. Like jumping through the air, wrapping their legs around the dude's neck and flipping the dude through the air. Like they did some nutty shit that was like, wow, that is acrobatic. If you can't appreciate that, I mean, obviously it is theater, but there's, there's a physicality to it that you, you know, it's very disrespectful to call it fake. It's not fake. It's in that little attitude. He did Sassy. Yeah. Yeah. He said it to a guy without any fear of his own safety being protected.

Speaker 3:          01:00:51       He thought by a camera and reality media wasn't shut down by the media, wasn't what it was today. The media wasn't shit that was just somebody who was taken up your fucking, it just didn't have to be cut to you about it. If he, if he can communicate with the guy and asked him, are there predetermined outcomes, how, you know, I mean, that's what he should have said. You know, instead of saying like the way he did it. Yeah. Well, I'll steal the standard question. Is it fake? It looks fake to me. You know, like, wow, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're pawing of a lion. Like, look at the size of that guy, that guy. You don't feel uncomfortable with that. This guy's all sweaty and hyped up from a fucking wrestling match where they always get kneed in the head and fucking kicked in the head accidentally and punched in the head. I think you see some of the shit they do where they do feel like flying sidekicks and hit each other in their head. They hit each other in the fucking head, man. There's a lot of times they're actually hitting each other. It's not even if it's choreographed, it's not precise as a fucking really hard way to make a living. It's funny, when I went to Miami,

Speaker 2:          01:01:51       April that week was also Wrestlemania, so all these old timers in Miami, so every radio show I went to do that week had an old time rescue. I was talking about it and it was very interesting to see that, believe it or not, these guys still have followings. Oh, I believe it. They still have followings. They do all those things that they show you in the wrestler where they people come and t shirts and talking about 1981 I went where the Jimmy superfly snuck is ice. Do you remember the fucking,

Speaker 4:          01:02:20       the, the war. He used to live in boulder in his heyday did it. He was up in boulder, shoot fucking it by that. A juice slim jams. This mother Fucker, I remember one time seeing him at the Potter carwash he had at that time, nobody had a seven BMW in the early eighties I don't even think they made them and he had them just because he had a fit one, and I'll never forget it was off season or something and he got out of that fucking car, Joe and he had a vein that was a court, I don't have to lie to know, but they go look at fucking the ultimate warrior giant dude and dogs, but his veins, his biceps with some of the biggest, most that was a bicep, but he had a vein out of here that lifted three quarters of an inch from his arm.

Speaker 4:          01:03:03       I seen it, I looked at it, stared at it and like was like, let me see how far his vein in his bicep went up. Three quarters of an inch off the skin. Brown. Yeah. There's a lot of people don't realize how big those that do some and see if you get ultimate warrior shaft. For me, I saw a hog in the first time, like when I was in Hollywood, like it was right outside of, um, before I've met him. I met him at a UFC and I had the honor of interviewing them once I get to talk. That was fun because I got to like talk, like get excited about pro wrestling with them, you know, and they pump it up. He's fucking great. His gray, that guy's got a lot of pain now it's got, I mean he's gone through. You ever see like all the operations? Holy Shit. That's the ultimate warrior. That's the whole fan. And how tall is that dude? He's like six, three or some shit. I'll talk. Don't focus on this deck Brian. That's how I was looking at his own shirt. He's busting through his own shirt, but you know, as far as crazy though, why does he have a heart finger? I think it's just Europe.

Speaker 4:          01:04:03       Is this Richard Simmons looking at his face crazy? Isn't it crazy that they decided to like paint your face up and the outfit with the suspenders, whatever the fuck they, I look at his arms. This guy was pretty, Yo came in the barbarian bros. I remember seeing when I was a kid, those two guys, they were in the Flamingo Kid. I don't know what happened to those guys. Face paint like war paint a strange thing. The idea that you know you're gonna, you're gonna draw your face up to make yourself look meaner. When you go to battle, like that's going to matter is like the ritual of rubbing shit on your face and put your wore mask on before you go into battle. Like where the fuck did that ever come from it? Does it make someone extra scary or if they got black stuff all over their face but he's talking to the bottom of the street, we, you're talking like that for them to be an American Indians and I'm talking about, you know, different people that have put war paint on with over the years the American Indians symbolize, remember Braveheart, he put like fucking Cheetos or something.

Speaker 4:          01:04:59       But like if you're in the green baret you gotta go take paint your face green. That's yeah, but it's still, it must put you there. Yeah. The ritual that it's time to fucking rock. It's time to get go crazy. It's got to get you. That's how you probably get fired up by putting the makeup on. And when they do you guys remember this date announcement. So what do you want to do? I don't know. What do you want to do?

Speaker 9:          01:05:48       And

Speaker 4:          01:05:48       for those that I didn't watch this, but rather listen to this podcast. That might be one. The most retarded thing. It's a big giant Roy it up. Dude handed out slim Jim. Is he still alive? Is that guy still alive? That's deck at the rob lit like a motherfucker. He's still alive before they figured out the test. Wow. I wonder what it looks like now in Slim Jim. What a strange ad. What is it supposed to be snapping to a slim Jim and why are you so angry, sir? What's going on here? You're fucking going nutty. Screaming and flexing. I'm going to do a slim kid bites into it. He flies out of your shoes like what the fuck kind of physics are we dealing with here? What is it? What kind of who? Who Green lit that commercial? I think they ultimate warrior has a blog now.

Speaker 4:          01:06:40       Oh he does? Yeah. Well how fun would it be just to start shooting steroids and that stop. Just get crazy and go hulk style. They go, you know what? I'm going to start fucking eating them and I'm not even doing cycles. Well I think if you look at those guys who have done that, like it is possible stay alive. Like look at the guys who were like big time professional bodybuilders. They're still like, they're still out there. They're, you know, they get off the shit and they, their body shrinks down to like normal size. I want to know what Tom Platz, his legs looked like tonight. That's when you got to find, that's what we got a fund. That's a good question. I want to know what Tom Platz looks like to that. I want to know. We all look no look like, listen bro. The first time you've seen, what was the movie pumping iron was the shit.

Speaker 4:          01:07:21       You can say whatever the fuck. I don't know. The Franco Columbo, a little fucking Italian with that back from here to here, laying brick and block all his life. He was like, I'd get a big blog. I the fuck out your face, your whole family tree, late fucking 12 inch block built everything in fucking hell. You look at you, you're little flock. He was Yo, he was yoked. He was a strong dude. Isn't it funny that you, you, you said Tom Platz and we both know that that guy was associated with having giant legs. It's like he's sitting on Hummus. I remember his incredible though. There's no other guy that has like that. Like there is synonymous with just one body parts legs. His legs were giant. You know, Campbell had big legs but uh, uh, Tom Platz had just ripped, I'm sorry. There were giant to shred. You find that picture.

Speaker 4:          01:08:07       They were so big legs just to show flats. T Z. He was like 10 80 if you can't cause that's what he was a king. His upper body was big. I mean, he was a shooting, nothing like his legs. His legs were shooting in their legs. Look at that. Look at his jaw. Look on his fucking jaw, his jaw, his shoes. He's got muscle and it's, that guy would crack a fucking Ari penis. Look at him. Look at his leg. Look at that. This is 1982 looking at his cheeks back up again. Oh my God. Look at his, his, his legs are the freakiest thing. Now look how much they stand out from the rest of his body. That's insane. It's like somebody opened up his legs and stuck a whole basketball in there. He's got a basketball in each leg. Look at the fucking size of those things.

Speaker 4:          01:08:56       They're crazy. That is the craziest Shit I've ever seen in my life. Ever. Ever seen 80 he has a waste for each thigh. That's insane. Look at the veins going to the fucking leg. What the fuck are they shooting? And he has no balls whatsoever. If you look fucking legs, when you look, when they get to like this size, there's so juice to the gills. Their balls or shot town. They just tapped show. Look at the size of him. My God, he was enormous. I got find it. It looks like today. Christ. Hi God. Look at the fucking sign.

Speaker 4:          01:09:35       Oh my God. That's like from another animal. It's like he took some meat off of a horse and put it on to his body, but he used to like try to sell leg workouts. You're like, no one wants to have legs like Tom. That's number one. Number two was not, no fucking running up hills. Got You. That shit. Not only that, it's also a genetic issue. He must have crazy genetics. That's what it looks like. That one of those milestones. What is balls live on here? Issue dogs. See if we could find that picture. I look at Robbie Robertson and then the black guy. Oh my God, this is fucking Robertson. Oh my God. Jesus Christ. God, look at this. There's a photo. We're looking at a photo of his back, Ladies and gentlemen, and it doesn't even look possible. It doesn't only possible. It looks like if you were going to do like a cartoon on what? Uh, you know, a bodybuilder would look like, you know, like if you were, if you were drawing it for south park or something, I can't even be real.

Speaker 4:          01:10:37       Isn't it crazy though, that that's what happens when you do shit like try to have competitions where you see who has the best body and the biggest muscles like standards sorta change. And then just like fake tits, like the, the standard becomes the unnatural, unachievable without drugs. Look. But what's crazy about this, Joe, is I thought that weightlifting and steroids and recovery and everything has excelled so much in 30 years. That had to be 1982 when Tom Platz took that picture. That's 30 fucking years ago. Oh look at that picture. He looks great. He's got no, he's got no pants

Speaker 1:          01:11:14       on and he's flexing his legs. That's cartoon land is cartoon. So cartoonish. It's crazy. He looks like a crazy, he has extra muscles

Speaker 3:          01:11:22       in his legs. It's, I mean, and he became famous for it too. So that became like the thing he concentrated on. If you keep hearing that sucking in the background, that's Joey Diaz. He's using some, some device. He's Jewish. He went right into the microphone.

Speaker 1:          01:11:38       Eureka vapor like a motherfucker, Joe Rogan.

Speaker 3:          01:11:42       That's uh, that's amazing that Tom Platz guy. That's amazing. That's shocking. It's amazing what a person can do. You can, the way you could change your body, just sticking some stuff in there and do a fuck load of squads. Yeah, brother. What are you doing? Joey did, is he tweeting? That's been text messages. I have my wife Brian. Do you think

Speaker 1:          01:12:09       we'd ever be uh, willing to, uh, get on a bodybuilding program and do roids for like a TV show now, but I'm supposed to Saturday I go to Richard Simmons and his class, his class doing it just because I think it will be funny. Oh, it'd be amazing. Where are you going to do is climbing? It's in Santa Monica. It's called. Yeah, I do. I want to, I have to do the UFC though. Saturday is the UFC. It's like, it's like sweating to the then how often? How often is he there? I think he does it like every week. Richard Simmons, do you fucking work out with Richard Simmons and all these really old ladies and gay guys and we're gonna make it happen. Let's work out with Richard Simmons Saturday. I mean look, either way it's, you'd be amazed. It's a good workout if you tried to do sweating to the oldies and he actually kept that. It's like a nice little workout. You know?

Speaker 1:          01:12:59       I think if I get really baked, it's going to be the best thing I've ever to cost. I think it's like 60 bucks. That's worth it. I left the y today. They would do and what's the country line? Country? My mind aerobics, bunch of fucking big rednecks and they're fucking doing aerobics. Well like country line dance and mixed with aerobics. It's like fucking zoom. So line dancing, line dancing mixed with the Roche aerobics. It's amazing what people do for jump up and down. I tell you what, I, I'm really digging that Mike Dolce Book Bro. I'm really, I love the, I never, I always said to myself, why do people go to the widely on a fucking treadmill where you can walk around in north Hollywood park and get some vitamin D and really sweat. Then I read his book, like I told you on the plant. The diet stuff is hard for me cause I don't like a lot of vegetables.

Speaker 1:          01:13:45       But the fucking workouts, you know, the beginner treadmill workout is sensational. I can't do the full speed yet, but I'm doing it. You know, it's, I'm doing it. He's coming on the podcast soon please. He's saying it's going to be on the weekends and you know what I'm saying? He's fucking great. He really is. That book has really helped me. A lot of them understanding I can't do a lot of shit cause of my knee, but he's got great basic exercises and I, you know, when I was really skinny, that's how I got size doing little strength

Speaker 2:          01:14:12       things. So I know where he's coming from. I mean in this book he talks about how he went up and a bunch of weight that he lost it. Just to prove his point, that strength. So I understand what he's saying. So I really enjoy the one book. I have the one, I'm going to get the other one. I couldn't find that you ought to all three of them at the tee shirt and it's not a bad deal. I just couldn't find that particular thing. So I ordered it on Amazon

Speaker 3:          01:14:33       but I think he's actually doing the podcast next week. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:14:38       Do at least he's, we'll have questions for him. His Shit because uh, his book is really helping me a lot of things.

Speaker 3:          01:14:43       We had a lot of podcasts next week, Dude. Yeah, we got dolce, we got Bassnectar I got to get back with that too. And we got bobcat Goldthwait and we've got Shane Smith. Dude, we're becoming on your television show. Hopefully we don't run out of shit tight that I'd tell you what man. I went to Adam Carolla's place yesterday and for first of all we need more employees cause he has 10 right. And second of all, I got mad podcast studio envy, his fucking set up. It's so sweet. Adam Corolla is a savage. He built his own shit. He built his own broadcast man, man, he's a man's man. He's a, he's a fucking construction worker fella. He's out there. He, he wired everything. So it all goes under the floor and it comes out through the, the legs of the table. The wires go through the legs of the table like that.

Speaker 3:          01:15:30       So there's no wires exposed and the whole thing is set up. It's really fucking sweet. It's really sweet. It's got cameras like high def cameras facing everybody and they're all controlled and remote control. It's kind of like a little broadcast booth. I mean, it's amazing what he's done. Like you over there and he'd get mad podcast studio envy. You took it to the next level. He's making it happen. We got to follow that. Did you have a nice time though, Jim and I show he was great. He's a great guy. But you guys talking about the girl else bros. It's very funny to his little sidekick. She's cute. She's hilarious. Um, what do we talk about? Everything. You know, talking about punching. Yeah. Talked about, uh, they like, it was all these like, uh, you know, like the hottest chicks in the world. Like they had some thing whether they like, you know, they were debating whether or not women belong in the hot chicks for me and him, a very different tastes.

Speaker 3:          01:16:20       Like he was talking about Olivia Munn, you know, Olivia Maan it's hot as fuck, right? That's about as hot as you can get. Okay. But he was like, yeah, Gosh, I have been to her house. She's not really smelly feet. He's out. They sound grounds. And he was talking about, you know, some girls will walk into a room and just, you know, everything's just stops and you just want to talk to them. Right. That Olivia one's not like that. Like, all right, really that's crazy. Talk live in my mom is all my top five. And then she came out of nowhere. You know, like I liked her on with like Kevin Prayer on that show, whatever attack attacking the show. But I never, but then I fell in love with her and then she left the fucking sho. Now Sho, he added that shut off Mike. Let me tell you something.

Speaker 2:          01:17:02       Break time. Fuck Cleveland. I just want to say it before

Speaker 3:          01:17:06       I forget. In Pittsburgh. I really did. Yeah, me too because I

Speaker 2:          01:17:10       fucking Columbus man. There was some crazy motherfuckers there is. He rocked Jason. Justin though. Got It. Made us the fucking edibles. I still got some fucking candy left at the house. You know, fucking Cleveland was crazy. We were outside that garage shop as a cool fucking spot, man. That's a cool fucking spot. If you don't want to perform at the Improv. I got nothing against the Improv, but that garage shop is a cool spot. Cool part of town. You know Pittsburgh, it was an honor to go to fucking Pittsburgh, but man, has the economy destroyed those little cities, man. The bar we were at is only open when there's a Pittsburgh pirate game or a football game and it's across the street from the stadium. It's called Mullins. They were fucking great. The Barbecue Sandwich was great and the guy who was telling me that it's just people don't go to that side of town number like people, you know, this is not a seven night a weekend history.

Speaker 2:          01:18:00       No more people going out and in Pittsburgh they go out to watch the games that get fucked up and they go there and you know, I've been going to Pittsburgh for 30 years. It's amazing that you look, go to these cities and you see these people and you say to yourself, what's next for these people? I mean this is the real core. It's so funny how I was losing, I was hating doing comedy in that way and it, and it transpired for me to like I was starting to hate to do comedy and it was because I was doing too much comedy in l h o l I wasn't doing comedy for real people. I was forgetting what I was doing comedy for. When you're in La a long time like I was and we are, we don't travel like normal headliners. They go out every week when I'm in La, you thinking about shit that you think in La and you think there's going to be somebody in the audience or who's here with you or what you're saying when you're on the road and you're talking to people in the Midwest or taxes that fucking real, you got to bring it a different way.

Speaker 2:          01:18:55       I can't bring it like la way I got and that's what I like about going on the road again. I really enjoy it like people like, do you really like going to the Midwest? No, I went there. I fucking love it. I love going to Iowa. I love going all those spots like that once or twice a year. Just to remind you that it's not all the big city man. We met some cool fucking beat hazing. We've seen some great properties, great trees spread out, low traffic. We've got too much weed and had too much weed, you know, and it's hard to see these cities and they got nothing and these are the people that are really voting is showing. We don't really know the country's issues. We see a thousand fucking cars and 20 weeks stores and shit and all the restaurants around here a fucking open.

Speaker 2:          01:19:37       You know when we went to Pittsburgh dog on a Saturday night, all of those businesses were Felice. That's the truth. Those are the people that are really voting. Those are the people that are really paying attention to what the fucking police was. Rough man. We will leave maximum tour years ago and I remember driving around the city going while there's not a lot of hope and this, it isn't. Not a lot going on here, but the people are bad motherfucker fuck. They just got so much that it's got a lot of good people. Yeah, no, no, no. Ohio's always man. When I used to work for the sports betting service day where the biggest collection of gamblers really like, and my Mac and my mind, I'm like all of the sharpest guys in New York and Vegas, they wiped their ass. That whole, that whole Youngstown with a hall of fame is all that shit.

Speaker 2:          01:20:19       That's big. Bookmaking Bay. You know, you got to remember one thing, you guys, the worst economy gets to more book Bacon. Prostitution gets bigger and keep talking. Drug sales go amazing. You know? That's why the mob and organized crime will never go away. They make more money when the economy's bad. You know, when we had a prohibition and the Great Depression, those monsters are making money, selling booze. People want to forget about their fucking problems. It really is. The worst economy is the more money people have to take a gamble with it. It's really weird to say there's more gambling because people are desperate, so people like, fuck it, I'm gamble more. I will drink more. The only fucking things that do not get affected by the economy is crime. Think about it. What? Gambling is not gonna affect it. Vegas is still booming every week we hear how, oh my God, we went to Vegas and there was nobody there. They keep building on it. Then they get money from somewhere. Somebody is putting that Betson and it ain't me and you, but somebody is losing. Yeah. They're just banking on the fact that it's going to bounce back that night. Then they stopped a lot of the building now. I stopped a lot of it. I mean everything. They just nutty for awhile.

Speaker 5:          01:21:27       They just opened a casino in Vegas when we were there or I mean and Cleveland while we were there that weekend. And that's like another way for them to try to bounce back isn't how they,

Speaker 2:          01:21:36       Eva Longoria opened up like a spot. A restaurant. Didn't she open up like a nightclub or some shit? Oh, restaurant. It's still there. She old is it, you don't drive by them a basal. Is that what is Hollywood boulevard? No, no, no, no, no. This is in Vegas. Oh yeah, she had like a club or something. Listen Bro, I never figured out. Somebody come with you. Joe Rogan and Glen, I'm an open up a club. When you're a Vegas, come hang out. We'll give you a kickback. It's part of your club. You give whatever percent they want. Right. What's that called? When you lend money and there's no guarantee you he'd give a certain amount of the club. I mean, how much do you make from that? You got late teen fucking partners. That's why I told you, I told you specifically and I know you don't like this shit, but you really got to watch the pimp of Joe Davis.

Speaker 2:          01:22:25       It's been out again. I'm fucking HBO. The sports thing they did for an hour. That motherfucker had it so bad, New York that he finally said fuck it. We got to buy a bar. Like they had a buy a bar, like they go, they got sick and tired of going out after games and spent the money. Watch this documentary. It is brilliant. I watched the guy the other day, I got a quote, John have a bar in New York, bought a bar in midtown Manhattan. His fucking slogan was I liked my woman blonde and I like my fucking scotch black. That was his shit dog. You gotta Watch this thing and he's this little town and he just went to New York, Bro. I mean he got married at like 42 because he had like, his knee was bad as shit because slave dateline, he had to, well he would have never got married.

Speaker 2:          01:23:09       Like this guy was a fucking dicks liner. He was slinging so much dick that he had to buy a bar, like to keep all his bitches in line and then that they took the bar from him. You got to watch the whole thing. We'll, we'll, we'll get called. He had acid and cvs. What? The bar special, but it's on HBO. He speaks on HBS but on HBO for a couple of months. And what's it called? It's just called David naming and you're going to love it because you remember it's not about football, it's about what this motherfucker, how crazy he was and how he was just a good old boy. But he owned New York Bro. He just owned it. He just had it by the balls. But then the fucking, they fucked him. They said he had a close the bar. They made them close to bar because it's because they said he had too many weird people hanging out in there too.

Speaker 2:          01:23:57       Any weird people? It's a bar. It's a bar, right? Nobody had too many fucking weird people. So watch this special. He really don't like people that live above bars. One of nutty way to live that as people that live in front of it above like food, like fast food. Like you know that grease smells going to go right on Chinese restaurant upstairs and there's something dangerous about it though. You live on, you live on top of the bar when you're a fucking hockey. That's the reason why you will live in Jersey. You see on the New York, UCL was bars at two dwellings over it. Nobody decent lives over a bar. They live over a bar because they know that two minutes away, no matter what happens, I've only known a few people that lived in midtown. You know, like when I was struggling, I only know a few people that were, I got over their apartment and get to see like how they lived.

Speaker 2:          01:24:44       But like living in cities like New York, when you get like, like, like studio apartments. That's a weird life man. It's weird. You enter into a door, it opened the door and you got like little space and it's like a tiny little sink and there's like a little hot plate. You know a lot of people, they're there, they're living almost like in closets. It's almost, it's like a big closet, a big closet already. Steven's just got his first fridgerator and it's not even a full size refrigerator. It's one of those small little frigerators and he's had one for, he didn't have one for like almost a year. Oh my god Bro. I'm advice that date. This girl Julie Novak and she was a Kansas girl that I met him in Colorado and follow holding the restaurants. Why did comedy yet and she was, you know, you meet people like I'm moving to New York, I'm gung Ho.

Speaker 2:          01:25:30       She went to New York with her body. It was a childhood dream. She had to go to new year. Archie's can Kansas. They went to New York and they moved to 15th Street, up the block from Manhattan on the 15th like in Ninth Avenue that they were paying 1800 a month. This is 1994 it was just what you said, you opened the door. It was a combination. One Room, 1800 a month, 1,801 room TV with a fireplace that didn't work. It was one room and then you open the door and there was a little kitchen and the bathroom was there. So when I had a fucker, the roommate was in the, she had a roommate. Oh, because they couldn't afford, oh 1800 she had a roommate, so she would have to sleep in the fucking living room and I would have fucked her in the kitchen on the floor.

Speaker 2:          01:26:12       Oh my God. And we couldn't fit your feet. You Go, oh my God. Horrible. Horrible. 1800 a month just to fulfill her dream to live in fucking New York. Are you fucking crazy? But that was good training. Why is that dream? So people love that shit. I just want to go to New York and then they get, then they get mugged. When you look up to a beautiful day, look down, your bags are gone. Your fucking Mama. What is it about, I guess there's something about being able to tell people that you live in Manhattan, New York or whatever. Listen, I told her a thousand times, you gonna live in New York City. If you don't live in like John Lennon and the Dakota, go fuck your mother. You didn't say go fuck yourself. Yeah, I'm going to struggle and drive down and cat gentleman and lived at the motherfucking Dakota and he walked around and good, he got for shot, whatever, but he walked good.

Speaker 2:          01:26:59       Don't know. What I'm saying is, you know he got shot. He didn't have a body guard and he was just a regular guy. He would walk through central park every day and get freshly squeezed orange juice and didn't give a fuck of it. Cost $12 or not because he's John Lennon. So a, the Dakota is like a really nice place. It is. Where else are you going to live? Is that the nicest place that's topples? Everything that's installed over anything? Well I live at the plaza bitch. I live with them motherfucking Dakota and my name is Tom Petty. What is like, what is that like? What it is like? They're like, what is like a real like go look it up. The Cota or what's your average property on the Dakota? Cause I think you have to buy the condo and they gotta be three, $4 million, which is really a fucking apartment.

Speaker 2:          01:27:40       Which is right. I mean I can't, I know he had two of them in there. You know, people will live with the Dakota just like authors will get bank. That's the type of people, everything around it. The code is expensive. You know, if you live in the Dakotas cause you fucking wow, I want a beautiful belt. Oh it's beautiful dog. It's the shit. That's the only way to fucking do it. If you're going to do it, it's incredible. I'm going to live in Bronx or Brooklyn or queens and drive in or take the a train. Fuck you. I'm standing right there under the code. Right. Central Park. Isn't that weird? If you think about it, what that building is, it's like a safe for rich people, rich people. It's like inside that safe, you cracked that safe open. There's a bunch of rich people in there.

Speaker 2:          01:28:20       I mean that's what it is. And it's right there on the street where all the poor people can drive by and look at all the rich like inside there. Well all they have to do is say, well, you know what though, you know society is functional and there are police officers so it doesn't, it's not feasible that we go in and just take all the stuff out of there. So we'll just leave it alone. But they know where the stuff is. The stuff is all in that room, that big box, that's a, that's a big mouse trap of rich people. And so that is, it's a bank. There's like little little pockets in that bank and inside that you can get money and there's jewelry and it's expensive stuff all throughout that place while you can't get in there now. But if the shit hits the fan, yeah, can get in there, that'd be

Speaker 3:          01:29:02       easier. That's one of the first things they're going to get into. You think so? Fuck yeah. Fuck yeah. When the shit hits the fan, why would you charge to Dakota? You know the only thing that fuck you up, his body guards. You know how many dudes are rocking body guards? Probably a lot in that place. So there you got a bunch of armed killers that are laying in wait things out of the roof and all that shit. But how long before they quit too and get the fuck out of there after a couple of weeks. This places abandoned. What does it cost to live day Joe? Just what's a property? The color. Just shout real estate. Just a mother. If it's even for a sale. I wonder if he even, yeah, they gotta be for sale. What are you talking about? Did you see that some guy in New York is selling as part?

Speaker 3:          01:29:43       It could be code Elliot and month, a million a year. What did you see that in a million a year for a parking spot? Parking spot. People think about it. They're like, well, it's there. It's close by. I don't have to pay for fucking tickets. That's hilarious. Apartments for sale at the Dakota, New York City, Manhattan Condos, one of the most famous residents, buildings and all of New York. It's the Dakota. It was a bold building when it was first developed, built so far north of the pulse of the city. At the time, citizens snickered and nicknamed it, the Dakota, a reference to the states of north and South Dakota, which were very far away from New York City. Isn't that funny? They nicknamed it the Dakota because they thought it was too far away. Meanwhile, this crazy city has built up so much now it's actually in the heart of everything.

Speaker 3:          01:30:31       Isn't that weird? It's weird that New York shitty must've been like way smaller back then. I guess obviously it has to have been. Yeah, I mean it's a crazy place, man. I, every time I go there, I fantasize about living there for like short periods of time to heal, but you know, I never, I don't think I can do it. I'd freak out. I'd have panic attacks. It's too much. Too much. You can't have like realize that that is, you're getting interaction. You're g you're, you're definitely getting something off of those people. You know? I don't know what it is, but I know there's a difference between the way I feel when I'm standing on a mountain and I, I look out and I see fields and I see like clouds and I see birds flying overhead. There's a different feeling than when I'm on the four oh five when I'm in the four or five.

Speaker 3:          01:31:15       There's a hive of humanity and there's some residual effect that you get from all these people. This is a different feeling that you get when you're in a city. You're all there. There's an awareness of, of humans are elective stress. Yeah. There's something, it's like some, it's pheromonal, whatever the fuck it is. It's, it's in the air, man. It's, it's not, it's not as simple and as innocuous as if you're not touching me, you're not affecting me. I think it's, we're affected by our environment some strange way. So that's why I don't think I've got to do in New York City when I was at my mom's house this weekend. And she lives in the middle of nowhere, like just farms, like across the street from her is a strawberry field and it's just in the middle of nowhere. And at night when I was sitting in my car waiting to go inside her house, I was just like, it was so quiet and so like the stars and,

Speaker 5:          01:32:00       and it was just, it was like, this is, I would not have any stress if I got to come home to this. It's crazy. Now you're, you're, you're

Speaker 3:          01:32:09       door. You hear cars driving by your street. You know, you might hear your neighbor wizards, wizards are in the neighborhood. You realize, uh, you know how much unnecessary shit you have to deal with. How much unnecessary stuff is inside your head. You know what, what it's all about. You know, it's all about life is supposed to be about enjoyment, right? So to be about having a good time, it's not supposed to be about dealing with all this extra curriculum nonsense. And we shouldn't have to have so many fucking people around us like we shouldn't be living here. This is silly. Like why? Why would this 20 million people? What you find? It's really weird when you talk to somebody like, uh, somebody who lives in New York and I'm so, I'm trying to figure out a comic who lives in New York that they just fucking love it.

Speaker 3:          01:32:58       They clip the badge and living somewhere else. Some people fit into that. A lot of people love it. You know? For me, I don't mind. I fucking lives there. He loves it. Who? Who's that Gaffigan? He's got kids too and knew it was there. You know, some people, they find a good place there. You know what I saw fucking crazy picture of Anderson Cooper Anderson Cooper lives in a firehouse. Does it really? Yeah, because it's busters converted firehouse. I did. Yeah. Awesome. Is that, yeah, it was a stupid fucking thread on my board where people were talking about Anderson Cooper being gay or who gives a fuck. I mean, he's gay. Who Cares? I see you want to fuck. I'm always trying to fuck you.

Speaker 5:          01:33:33       You, can you, can you imagine bringing a girl home and like, like I'll be right down and like coming down like on the, uh, Firepool where, you know, with a bottle of champagne,

Speaker 3:          01:33:43       I guess you can, you can see the actual place

Speaker 5:          01:33:47       that'd be the ultimate podcast studio. Fucking making it out of a fire station or something in the summer along those lines. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:33:54       You know, what would be the, the ultimate would be that, uh, that missile silo, that drug dealer had vice documentary, I remember that. He buys a four point $3 million in New York home. Anderson Cooper Barney firehouse, the 8,240 square foot home. Wow. That's a huge place in Manhattan at 84 west third street between Sullivan and Thompson's, which he purchased in September. Both the original spiral staircase brass fireplace. So beautiful. It's pretty dope fire stations. Pretty sweet. Well, the crazy thing is, oh yeah, you, you say what's crazy is it still says fire patrol on it and it's his house now.

Speaker 5:          01:34:40       Yeah. I mean that's kind of dangerous, isn't it? Like people coming up to the place and be like, help me, I need to drop off this. I wonder how many babies he gets dropped off. Oh God. What if Anderson Cooper comes out of his house every morning? There's like two babies and he's like, damn it again.

Speaker 3:          01:34:54       Four point $3 million. This is why it's amazing it because

Speaker 4:          01:34:58       somebody is getting fucked by the fuck. Pay 4.3 for fucking fire truck house. See if they left the fucking fire engine dance that's a pussy magnet or this whole mango or whatever it is that you're an asshole magnet. It's, I think it's Kim been converted. I mean, I think inside it's pretty dope. Um, it's um, it's more than 8,000 square feet and that's a big fucking house. Some New York City. Fuck yeah. In New York City, that's an enormous, but there's all these cool photos of it. It's pretty dope, man. You gotta be creative. This is creative as it gets an old fucking Fiat guaranteed. I love to know if they left the poles inside so he could fly down the fucking pole. I know. I would. That's part of the deal and I'd have the Batman thing to shoot right back up. You got it. You got to fly down there.

Speaker 4:          01:35:43       You got to fly down the pole of the ball and when people just got a garage man. How about having a garage in New York City? Who the fuck has a mirage? He bought a house with a garage and I see I would live in New York City if I could live like that. There was only one way to live in New York guys and that's what a lot of fucking gators because it cost a lot of fucking genius to live in New York. If you're super rich, you could pull off live gives a fuck. I take a cab everywhere, freshly squeezed and Bagels are 20 bucks. Who gives a full, a lot of guys just have drivers, so super rich dudes that have like a pen houses there. They just have like a driver. You know what does it place? That's his house. Whose house? Oh my God.

Speaker 4:          01:36:21       That's I think the people that lived before or when it was on sale. I'm guessing. Oh my God, that is fucking killer man. What a killer house. Yeah, you could put jacuzzis you can. I've been to, I've been the one incredible house in uh, in New York. It was a friend of mine's dad had a, a penthouse place. I don't remember what homeboy did, but he was very wealthy and we went to the, uh, the top of this building and that's where the apartment was in the fucking view was insane. It was insane. He was just in the middle of all these giant buildings. They were all lit up and he had this enormous glass opening. Like his, his, his window. He was on a corner, he had a corner Penn House and it was just, it was staggering. Like you would look out there and you just go, wow.

Speaker 4:          01:37:12       Like you kind of get it. It's like they get to live like in a science fiction movie, like every day they look out their window and they're on the 90th floor or some fucking building or whatever the hell it is. You know, I don't know what he even went to. Highest building is there now, but I mean if you, if you're on the 50th 60th floor and you're looking out and seeing all of Manhattan and you're like in the heat of it and it's kind of crazy. Science Fiction Mad. There's, if you were like really into that like man I could see but I think the baddest house I have seen was a Maroon Creek, maroon bells and Aspen, Colorado. We were building a house I was working on for the electrician and the guy next door we became friendly with him and he was showing us, this guy was like, can we produce it?

Speaker 4:          01:37:51       Don't ask me who the fuck it was. It built the house from scratch. But yeah, I could tell that he was kind of off the chain, like not a junkie and nothing. He had manmade hot springs in his yard. Like you would walk away under this under the moonlight and he had them like 40 yards from his house. He got like four different ones. It was just amazing the view. He had a Colorado looking down from one of the top clips up in Maroon bells. I mean it was fucking, it would take your breath away. It would really go like you would fucking, it would take your breath away. That's really weird to see that user where the user work a lot. To me a huge, you know, some people don't, don't, don't care. I'd rather just be in a nice neighborhood or whatever I need.

Speaker 4:          01:38:32       I like looking out the window and seeing shit when I look out the window and see shit. It's inspiring. I that was like one of the best parts of Colorado. One of the best parts of being a look out the window and just see the mountains and the trees and the, you know, if you could look over the ocean and you see the, Oh that's like the best view where you got a little bit of mountain, a little bit of ocean, you can just stand there. It's like you're looking at the greatest natural art ever created like me and one of nature's most beautiful and wondrous accomplishments is the beauty of nature itself. Looking at mountains, looking at the water, looking at, especially at from afar, looking at all of it together. Like when you're flying into Hawaii and you can't even believe how beautiful it is.

Speaker 4:          01:39:11       Like look at this fucking place, look at it. He'd like it charges you up just with its own natural beauty. But even Malibu has natural fo Uli, Malibu, staggering beauty. You know? Uh, Columbus. I seen some shit. The trees, the way they were cut. You ever look at Columbus or a Malibu real estate? Have you ever looked? No. Jesus Christ. You just know. You go online and like look Google like Malibu real estate and see some of the houses for like $60 million short. But then they have, where is all this money coming from? Who are all these people? How many rich people are there? Like Jesus Christ. Here's some people buying up $60 million houses.

Speaker 5:          01:39:48       I know we talked about this a long time ago on that podcast, but I don't know if we had video back then, but like remember Mike Tyson's abandoned mansion Suttington Ohio and like people in Ohio would just break into it because he abandoned it and so in there was like, it was still furnished and it was like he just left it and it was really creepy. Like, cause the water, the inside pool had not been treated for a long time and, and like look at this bathroom. This is like a crazy shower. Wow. And uh, they had this cages for ages where the animals in the back and then they had it like his own basketball court, teen Tyson and then number that was like don king got them into all that team Tyson Shit. And look how nice it is outside in Ohio. Can you imagine that?

Speaker 5:          01:40:34       That would all be your, it's pretty walked away from that. Yeah. He just walked away from, Oh, I'm sure he walked away. Five of them like that. I heard his house in Jersey was fucking awesome. It probably, I dunno, but like the website that that's from, it's called Elicit Ohio is one of my favorite websites. It's just abandoned ship in, in Ohio. Like look, this old music school where it's just a bunch of keyboards lined up and there's no kind of a Ben Shit in Ohio. Oh yeah. This is just a guy that fascinated, you know, he, he's fascinated with it and he talks about like the old penitentiary. Uh, here's the old amusement parks and stuff and air force air force town. It's called Elicit Ohio. I said Ohio. I L L. I C. I t, ohio.com. Here's an air force town, which is a frog. And uh,

Speaker 4:          01:41:24       well what does that have broken rollercoaster it. What are we doing? We're just watching things. The conversation is actually a it to us, like scrolling through it together. But Mike Tyson, his old house. I wonder if you would be creeped out if you bought it and you knew that like Mike Tyson had just gorilla fuck chicks in every room. The house. No, it probably has a lot of positive energy in it. You think so? Oh yeah. Except for the Brad Pitt Energy. Oh yeah, that's Taurus. Hilarious. That's Joey Diaz is crumbling in the background. Ladies and gentlemen, what does that set up? Pop Popcorn Mike Tyson have walked away from I probably a bunch. Right for seven. I mean how much did he make? He must've made like half a billion dollars or something crazy. Right? Cause they said, everybody says that Guy Rob Don King. Yeah. Who knows? Who knows? Who knows where it all went. It's isn't it crazy though when you see that story like repeated over and over again throughout history. I know guys, when I got shit load of money and then it all goes away and then they got none. I mean it happens so often.

Speaker 4:          01:42:29       Well, didn't end the way he was living so crazy. He was given away. Bentley's remember that he got an accident with his Bentley and it gave it to the cops and the cops got in trouble. Like you can't like just accept a Bentley from Mike Tyson while you're on the job. He had no idea what they just told to. He had 80 billion and go, why can't he fucking just accept the battling that's fucked up for the cops? Cause the cop could have sold that Bentley and not worked for like five years, like quit. And I just got to live off this battling money bitch. And they sell that Bentley for quarter million bucks that there was a lot of money. Aren't they? Especially the convertibles. She was so crazy. You just crashed them and giving them away. He's going to do a one man show now in Vegas.

Speaker 4:          01:43:07       Yeah, I heard he's already doing it. I heard it's amazing. I he's already doing it. I heard it's amazing. It's amazing bro. That guy has good tell a story like I don't even get them into boxing and fungus. What a great idea. He's a savage. That guy's a fucking sad. But Joey is, we need to get you a one man show and he could just, you could just, uh, would you be willing to do that? I could do everything. You just want to do a one man show night in Vegas. I got plans already though. Don't worry about it. But he's the type of motherfucker that you could just let him go for hours just about the trainer yet. And then he has six chapters that you could go 12 hours on. What's the original guy that adopted that model? Then he went with Teddy Alice, and then his days with

Speaker 2:          01:43:52       don king that his days with that fucking skank from saved by the bell. Then his two years in fucking prison. Then when he came out to the guys that killed brothers, what's with the bow ties and shit? Remember they were guarding him for a while. Then two years ago he smacking somebody in a fucking movie. You understanding the different extremes, not the match. He lost a little girl, not to mention these fucking Mike Tyson and people look at him sometimes and you may judge them, but that guys, Jimmy is fucking deep, deep, deep. And when you watch that, we both watched that Tyson biography together. Then we, and he said some shit in the beginning of that made you fucking think about my, I remember watching a hotel room somewhere and you said two or three things that you're like, you know what the fuck you look at that guy.

Speaker 2:          01:44:37       He's as intelligent, as deep as can be. He'll figure you the fuck out. He was beaten fucking people up. I just watched him against Irish Pat Murphy or something, but he's a killer. He was a good guy, was a killer when he was at his best. I mean we, we talk about him all the time because when anyone is at his best, it was like a, it was a force of nature who said he just had an, whenever someone who can can summon up intensity than other people just can't match. It's always fascinating to watch a guy who just raises it to the next level and that's clearly what he did. He came along and just took it to another place. Like everybody was like, Whoa, we never seen intensity like these eight chapters right in front of our eyes. How many boxes do you know that went to prison in the middle of their career or football players and now they're making movies.

Speaker 2:          01:45:17       Is this got him going to prison under like some pretty shady circumstances? He went in there for fucking rape. Yeah. I'd go with a girl who had it all ready and had falsely accused someone of rape. She was only like 19 years old and she had already before him falsely accuse somebody and they still didn't get them off and their, their, their defense was so crazy. It was like, what do you expect him to do? Look at who he is. She should have known. She should have known that if she's going to be alone with him, he was going to fuck her. Like that was the defense, which is, you can't say that that guy, that guy is getting thrown away more money thrown away. He scrolled away more money than a small country has that back account. Oh yeah. He's showed us through more money than 10 people live through in a fucking lifetime.

Speaker 2:          01:46:05       You know how interesting that guy would be to get them stoned by mistake. Like just to give him a hit a fucking so, oh Gee Kush and let that motherfucker go. Just let him go. Just tell him just about three of his boxing fights and what led up to it. Yeah. What happened in Japan against Buster Douglas, you know, so I, I wish him all the luck in the world cause that's a true motherfucker right there. We watch that guy come, go, come, go again. His daughter had died two years ago. Not many people can bounce that back from that Bro. You know? And he's really trying, you know, I used to see him at the YMC, but for all the fucked up shit I used to see him try because they had them in a rehab up there. He was always pulling over the ass and teaching a kid how to throw a punch. Right. You know what I'm saying, Dawg? And that's what it's all about it. He would always stop and walk past the boxing thing and if he sees somebody, he'd go and he'd go like, let me help you. He would hold the bag fee. Well fucking champion all the bag for you one time. He can still

Speaker 3:          01:47:05       talk to, he doesn't have problems forming sentences or anything. He doesn't have like, you know, speech issues. So if you're got to do a one man show, that's the last thing you need. You know, that's a satisfying about boxers, man. As you'll watch a great one. And then you watch him in an interview later in his career and you hear him slurring his words and you're like, man, he paid, he paid a big price for that life, that wildlife or has paid a big price. You know? And now we're sitting here watching it. But some people, man, that must be maddening to know that, you know, your career has forced you to in your later years not being able to communicate. Right.

Speaker 2:          01:47:39       But do they know it? They know that they can't communicate, right? Well they just want what's in their mind? What's their head? Well, I think this

Speaker 3:          01:47:47       drums and there is a spectrum rather. I think there's a broad range of, of, of brain damage. But I think a lot of them don't know what the fuck is going on. Like that was the thing about the HPO a football special and they were talking about concussions. Uh, they showed a lot of these guys later in their life and they didn't know what was going on. These poor guys were like delirious. They just literally, their wives just guide them all around their wives. It was like they had an a child, you know, they had a child had to take care of, you know, so there's, there's a broad range of trauma

Speaker 2:          01:48:17       related to that, bro, with football. I don't blame it all on the fucking, uh, the head shrub. I blame it on your body getting hit by a truck for fucking 10 years. You're getting hit by a truck seven months of a year. That's reality. You know, how much abuse can your spine take? How much abuse can you Oregon's take? It depends. Fucking shops. You have the shot that I would give you if you're standing like this, getting the ball. You know when a guy waiting and he gets it and I come from the all the writing, I give you the kidney. So I don't blame it all on the fucking head shots. It's gotta be a motherfucker to put your head down and hit somebody. Even when it does it your spine, something's gotta be Bro. That controls, you know all the electrodes that controls all this shit in your fucking, your body.

Speaker 2:          01:49:11       A little spine. You know, I've told you many times, the last two years before I stopped doing blow at the end of the night and my fucking spine, but the top of my fucking neck with her, it would give me little voltage like, so I knew it was starting to fuck shit up and you can't talk. I can't imagine. But I want to know if they know what they're going through that I want to know. If you sit them down and go, how do you feel? And if they would say to you at times, I want to express myself and I can't.

Speaker 3:          01:49:39       Yeah, I'm sure they can't. I'm sure that's exactly what they were telling you. That's gotta be a terrible fucking feeling man. Like he's gonna be terrible.

Speaker 2:          01:49:46       I see something like Vinny Corto

Speaker 4:          01:49:48       who I know he's been punched in the head lady fucking times. You know, I could talk to Vinny for hours. I talked to him last week for like 45 minutes and he'll go from sentence to sentence and it's amazing how he remembers certain things and I'm very impressed by it. But at the same time when I hang up the phone with them, I'm sure there's another thousand things that he's forgotten, right? For the 20 that he's remembered, he's really forgotten a thousand so I might think he's sharp and that that's all he remembers is a handful of that stuff yet compromised. You know there's a certain amount of compromise you just, you're going to get, if you were involved in kickboxing or contact sports or football, any anytime where you're getting head collisions over and over again you're going to get, you got to pay a price.

Speaker 4:          01:50:31       It's like how much is the price you're gonna pay? Is it just going to be like a weird little achy thing? Like you know like you might get like a hurt wrist is going to be like that and your brain's like, I that's kind of annoying. But not that big a deal is going to be that. Or is it going to be something really serious when your mouth doesn't work right or you can't formulate certain words where you struggle to try to put together a sentence and you forget what you were talking about right in the middle of the sentence and you're not even, hi, nice. It's really weird how I know from two ways I know from riding a motorcycle who and falling off of banging my head a few times. I know from getting hit in the head a few times and I also know like how you feel the next day you get hit in the fucking head, whatever used to it, then you feel terrible is what you, you feel.

Speaker 4:          01:51:17       You do feel a darkness and just call. It feels dark. It feels like there's no sun. That side. You know when you get clocked in the head for a couple of days and you see things, that's a good way of putting it. It's fucking crazy. I know when I got clocked in the head, it scared the shit out on me. You know? I survived. I lived to tell the story. But you, you know that it's not right for you. You said you'd know all that. What I'm doing is that fucking healthy because this isn't normal for me to feel this way. You know? It's not what the concussions, it's not only the, the, the, the words and your memory, it's also your mood. It controls your fucking moods. I could control whether or not you ice yourself or you fucking don't know how you live. You know? That's all the shit.

Speaker 4:          01:51:58       That's enough. Every brain, you know, I don't know what they are, but you know, different, like somebody was saying that the front of the brain controls your wrangler and that the Buddhist belief for years, if you meditate through meditation, you could get through that part. I'm just giving an example, but I think that affects a fucking lot of things. Your mood and your depression or your and to the fucking has to men. And that's why when they talk about football plate, they bro, when, when uh, who kicks hard, the UFC cro, cop waving, when cro cop kicks you in the fucking liver, you're not going to feel that for a couple of weeks. And should I have, I got to do something to your insides because you kicking me over here. It's got a borrow from something. You don't have those fucking kicks. Got To do something. That is a thing that people don't think about.

Speaker 4:          01:52:37       I was like, the damage to your organs, Jesus Christ fuck packs from whether football or kickboxing or whatever. Now you've got to think about that because you can't see it. So you just assume everything's okay in there, but you know like someone's Shin slamming in the rib cage and fucking rattling all your shit full blast into your rib cage. Really? Jesus Christ. You know how much, how many of those can you take? What's going on inside there? You know, they was showing up is everything on the other fell. When we were in Pittsburgh, I was watching and I have to do TV was I'm trying to write whatever and that was showing a Earl Campbell and that would show the best 10 power backs of Walnut. And they showed Earl Campbell playing against some team and he had a plague of something Solomon and they said, look at the shot, but it gives him what had by mistake, he hit him with a, the in the solar plexus pick about it right here by mistake like he was, he went to tackle them and I tripped over play his foot. So the momentum and him coming around the D was right. That band, oh my God. But you just seen it. It was like hidden Carbonell Campbell. And you'll come and as, as he's coming around band, it was just, it was perfect. The fucking written this year and this motherfucker, you just seeing his arms go like this bro. Like everything. Space Cake. Don't give him more. When are you doing?

Speaker 1:          01:54:01       He can't take all this. No one can take all this. Just know. He just seen a whole bag of popcorn la incredible. Because it's what amateurs shift that your shit when you call me crying now, an hour from now, Joe Rogan, you should see I want to talk to you Dana dear on. We did this podcast every everyday and she ate a whole bag of that popcorn and by the end of it she was so calm she couldn't even, I had to call her cause I was so worried about her. Like we stayed here for a bit until she came down. But wow. Yeah. You've got to get someone some coffee or something, right? Yeah, he'd do what he do. You just got to ride it out. Yeah. There's nothing else. Let's go ride it out. It's like a Piss test for you. Fucking amateurs. Don't be playing with those edibles.

Speaker 1:          01:54:43       Dangerous out of bolts are danger, my friend that is not regular weed folks. That's not regular week. You gotta you gotta understand that it was going to affect you a lot differently when you eat it. I was just hungry. That's the only reason I'm going to be talking to two fucking space to that 40 minutes. Fuck that. Fuck that dog. I haven't even a level a couple of days is Columbus and he just ate a whole bag of popcorn and one of those you're going to be crying and one hour, dude, remember those cookies? I gave us a in Columbus, Ohio and you ate them right before you went on stage. Did you start feeling it while you're on? I think I remember you saying something about it. I felt a little bit on. So you know whenever you eat another boy and you go on stage, you go to yoga, you go to Jujitsu or whatever the edible sits in you. But once that adrenaline mixes with the edible, you've got a different type of fucking savage in that. How about our friend that gave us those cookies in Chicago and you had a mild heart attack from what happened was, this was a couple of years ago,

Speaker 2:          01:55:44       we did the one Chicago Club. Well, that's very a white. My 40th birthday he came up to and it was crazy. This guy gave me these fucking cookies that were a rapper. He brought them and I ate two of them. They're life changing cookies. Oh my God. The next day, the next day I had like an off beat my fucking heart. Like my, uh, my, I had like a heart murmur, you know, three days later I went to the doctor and they're like, yeah, you had something. What the Fuck Julie? Oh my God, you gotta file artist. I'm telling you, dude, they were not regular cookies. I don't know them later. I don't know what to after he put those weren't regular cookies. There's a point, there's a point where I could tell what they were. These cookies I was eating for a while. I'm not going to say from what place.

Speaker 2:          01:56:29       I'm not a year later that the dude was putting volumes, these cookies with doing something to me that these cookies with doing something to me that nothing else was doing. I been around the block so I could feel it. I know the difference between eating like a cookie. And so he knew that he was going to get people hooked. He was saying these are the strongest fucking things guarantee. And then when they got a call one day, that whole, I got a call with me, went to the fucking hospital. What in the ass hole? The guy was like, Bro, you don't have THC. I know you can't be this asleep. Like this whole wow, that's, yeah. Well that's the thing about having marijuana all shady and semi illegal the way it is. You know, there's a lot of fucking disreputable folks. You're going to get involved in this just to make money.

Speaker 2:          01:57:16       You know? Think about like pots. Good man. Yeah. Pot's good. But he, when people are selling it, you're gonna get people that are just trying to make money. They're not like pot advocates per se. Some of them are just in the business to make money. Business people stick around for that long, right, because you've got to put too much wheat to kill the radio to, well, the whole thing is it's gotta be a one shot operation, so it's gotta be a store that buys three pounds. They trim it and whatever they have leftover, they make the edibles with. If you go with to buy wheat to make other bulls, you're going to lose money. It's not going to work for you. Make it from the trimmings are the fucking seeds and all the fucking stems and that's how you do it. That's how you do it.

Speaker 2:          01:57:52       That's to do it to be profitable because it's once doesn't have the same impact. What do you mean? Yeah, yeah, it's all the same strength. It's all the same strengths. The stems have the same amount of Tsh, but all the leaves and all that Shit. You put it with the butter and you still get the butter with the same high THC ratio really sustain from the leaves. They trim it with the leaves. That's all made from leaves dog, you know when they tell you, oh yeah, it's way through. They'd take a beautiful bugs grow and then they take the leaves. They trim it when you buy. Okay. Let me give you an example. That grind, you have that grind that you have has two pieces. It has a piece for the weed and other little weed. It has a piece for Kush. What does it call it Kiki? Kiki. Okay. See how much Keith you got in there. There's a lot. Is there a lot. Okay. This is what you do when you go to a weed store. Now before they give you that weed, they beat the kief off the week. They do. That's how they sell kief you bring, we'd evolved from a weed store now there's no keef on it.

Speaker 2:          01:58:48       Yeah. That you could get 25 grand for that shit dirty at grand. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          01:58:52       The place next door. It's one of those schools that teaches you how to grow weed and like you can have like like up to seven plants or something like that and they and that you use there. There are lighting and just go, you know, a couple of days a week or whatever to check on your plants. It's like kind of, it's kind of cool, but they just bought a, an extraction machine and so now they can extract the wheat into like the weed juice where you can just

Speaker 2:          01:59:14       this guy show up. This guy. I love it. Yeah. I love y'all

Speaker 5:          01:59:20       Brandon. Next door he showed me he has a syringe and it's just a syringe of like liquid and you just so I can just drop it.

Speaker 2:          01:59:27       No, I not fucking boring an intravenous. How long before someone takes that intervene? No, no, no. It's a syringe just to drop like a little drop on a, on, on your nugs. Oh, I understand what you're saying, but I think how long before someone takes that and shoves it into a vein? Oh, totally. Them. One year. You will, the spoken reef will be obsolete one year. Would you be smoking reefer smoking? It's like 2012 Joey Refa will be obsolete between these things because this is the first one that's prediction. This is the fucking first one. The next one's going to be. Right. Okay. The next one's going to be in your fucking iPad. You know what I'm saying? You just have to look through general, but we just have to assume it. Gentleman, if they're extracting fucking weed juice from weed, how long was it going to beat? So some motherfucker opens up a store and says, Joe Rogan, I'm going to put the shit you drink in the morning or the blue mix and I don't take, we'd use with that, which is all natural.

Speaker 2:          02:00:27       They're going to find out that we juice mixed with the shook up without you the shit where you drink in the morning, the shot, it's going to be like that. Well, you know that they say that when you juice weed or when you eat it, you eat it like raw. It doesn't get you high, but it's really good for your body. Yes, super. Really super helped start getting ready in a year. This is going to be obsolete. She asks people still in to smoke pot, but you're not going to have to, you can just go to meet Joey. Did you bring the dripper? It's going to be like a dean. It's going to be an advisor team thing and you could control it. Look what's going on with soda. Now you can make [inaudible] at home that's just gone. This shit. Yeah, very good. You know like when you go to a grocery store

Speaker 5:          02:01:08       store and it has like the off brand that's like 89 cents and it tastes like coke but like flat or, or are just not as good. That's what it is. And it makes no sense. Like his Po is soda and Popcorn really that expensive where we have to make it at home.

Speaker 2:          02:01:21       I think the idea is you're supposed to be conserving somehow because you know you're recycling it using your own glasses and it tastes like shit though. What's the, what's the other thing they have the thing that you put in clubs, soldier or water?

Speaker 10:         02:01:33       Uh,

Speaker 2:          02:01:35       I don't know. You remember you come buy it. It's like why them was something you put your bottle. Yeah. Yeah, at the gyms. Now anybody, I tell you what I know about you motherfuckers. Joe Rogan, I know you remember this. Remember when we were kids. How south. So he used to come if it came like this sounds like a tank where you were professional alcoholic, that's what you had at your house. Remember New York Seltzer whenever it happened to that. Ah Yeah. Yes and no, but it's got to be at like Jewish Delis only. Like they don't have it but a lot of, but it's so weird. I remember when I was a kid I go to [inaudible] house and we get great koolaid and put self surrender from that gun. It was the best thing I ever tasted in my fucking life. Do you play with bubbles in that motherfucker?

Speaker 2:          02:02:16       Tremendous. What's up? You guys know that this is one of the, one of the craziest fucking stories ever. I think we've talked about this on the podcast. I'm not sure. But that the cocaine, you know cocaine used to be in Coca Cola. Yeah. Yeah. And but the people in New Jersey take it out now. Yeah, we talked about, did we talk about it on the show? Yeah. That's how nice he is at that. There's like billions of dollars in cocaine being made by a company that its tracks it from the the leaves. They used to make coca cola or cocaine or ruts and never, like I said to you, it's the whole business. Once you tap into the whole thing and you learn how to control like all right, the cartel in the 80s Pablo Escobar, all those guys that when they were processing code, that's what they were doing. They weren't selling it.

Speaker 2:          02:03:00       They were getting it and selling a kilo for 6,000 and what you did with it was what? What was your business? Okay. That was how it started. Then they said, wait a second, we're going to become partners and get some of that from New York where we're taking it from. So instead of selling the key for eight from them, we're going to get 16 we're going to get 20% of their profits. Okay. Then they said, Ooh, that's some good money too, but they were paying people to transport it. So I would come to Joe Rogan ink and go, Joe Rogan every week, Tuesday you're going to transport 2000 kilos. At 5,000 of Kalo. Okay, that's it. We're going to do that to you, and then they did that. Then Carlos laid dead, got out of prison and went to the cartel and says, what we're going to do? I'll be a new fucking partner.

Speaker 2:          02:03:47       50% you're going to process it. You're going to do this. I'm the one that's going to take it up to the state, sell it, set the pricing, control the routes. He got the island off the coast, whatever, and he got the island there, so now they, they ran it from a to z. You're following me. They control different a to z. They just weren't coke dealers. No more. The same thing's going to happen with this weed. The same thing is happening that these guys are getting a pound. They turn and half of that to Keith. They turned the other half into edible and they, the other half, they sell at 20th fucking grant. There's no loss in wheat. When they take the stems off. Now they'll just throw that into mixing the edible weed they found floating off please. But it's Mexican weed, so he only cares about that. I didn't hear about it. Yeah. Yeah. There's some kind of like, oh my God, 2000 times or something like that. Right. Fucking magic dumped from like a probably I guess

Speaker 11:         02:04:38       could be right.

Speaker 2:          02:04:39       They might've been running out of gas. They had to toss it over, but

Speaker 12:         02:04:43       what would the best me right here.

Speaker 2:          02:04:45       Why is it even on the ocean? So where was it coming from? 180 bails. Oh my God. 8,000 pounds of weed. Holy fucking shit. 180 bales of we'd found floating in the ocean. And what do they do about that? Did they have to burn it now? Can't take it. They put it somewhere. Then when they do a big cookout, well, what's the navy have? Medical Marijuana. Why doesn't the government sell it? We could use that money. Well, first off, they found the bales. How much water got into those bales? Sell it cheap. Let me tell you something. I smoked fucking weed that's been dry from bales in the early eighties really fucking horrible. It tastes like salt water. Oh really? Fucking horrible. Blow the seeds that weeds got season. We don't want them to do, but that we could use that for edibles. But the thing with that weed is they'll take it off.

Speaker 2:          02:05:34       How many bales? Hundred and 80 by the time they burn those bands, that government gets the burden. No beat. 92 bales left. Really think I was fairly well covered. Tell please. So what about the, the salt water and all that shit? Some poor soul or fucking some porcelain like North Dakota where you can't get good. Need more fucking brother that likes to smoke blunts and make videos at his house. What's the hardest spot in the country to get weed? Where's the hardest part? Front of the Capitol in front of the camera right in front of the cow might be the easiest. I know you ain't gonna get no weed at the fucking White House. I think you'd get weed everywhere. I think now in this country it's wide open. Could you go on the streets like the old days? I think if you had to yet. Hey Dude, pull up Penn Jillette's rant on Obama and we'd Penn Jillette fucking nailed it. The, you know,

Speaker 3:          02:06:24       Penn Jillette has a podcast now on Sundays and uh, Adam Carolla's a network and a, it's called Penn Sunday school. And he went on this rant about how fucked up it is that that marijuana is illegal and that people are in jail for it. And one out of six people in jail are in jail for marijuana. And he, he went on his fucking brilliant rant, man. And it's, it really is. It's a shame. Like what, what, what's going on right now, arresting people for marijuana with all the information we have about how we, you know, we know it's not dangerous. We know the laws are ridiculous. It's a real shame when you see people getting arrested for, and he makes this intense point about it.

Speaker 12:         02:07:03       Business.

Speaker 11:         02:07:07       We know this president has said his own book dreams from my father, 1995 before entering politics, he admitted that he had used marijuana and maybe a little blow, maybe, maybe a little blow, which as you know is crazy talk. Maybe a little blow is what someone who uses marijuana every weekend says, man, I used cocaine once. It was crazy, but he used every or two ago. Maybe a little blow. That's true. That's such an odd casual way to say, ah yeah, maybe a little now he is not left us to state's rights. As you know, a medical marijuana as our good friend Joe Rogan will point out to you any time medical marijuana you can get in California and the feds are coming in to try to stop this. They're showcasing piece of states' rights. Don't mean Jack Shit to the Obama administration on anything except a sub gay marriage.

Speaker 11:         02:08:09       What troubles me about this is, and there's, it is not hypocrisy because as everybody knows, hypocrisy doesn't bother me very earthy and so Obama and yet you feel this is, I think it's beyond hypocrisy. I think it's something to do with class. You know, in a lot of people have accused Obama of class warfare, but in the wrong direction. I believe this is Obama chortling with Jimmy Fallon about lower class people. Do we believe, even for a second, anybody believe that if Obama had been busted for marijuana under the laws that he condones would his life have been better if Obama had been caught with the marijuana that he says he uses and maybe a little blow blow cocaine blow felony conviction. This casual attitude towards drugs, a casual attitude door, drugs that makes him really cool on the, on Jimmy Fallon makes him the hip president.

Speaker 11:         02:09:14       I'm the cool president. I'm happy. Happiest happened as president. I say weed, I say blow. It's all a big deal. Hahaha. Huge laugh from the college students. And if he had been busted under his laws, he would have done hard fucking time. And if he had done time in prison time in federal prison time for his weed and a little blow, he would not be president of the United States of America and he would not have gone to his fancy ass college. He would not have sold books that sold millions and millions of copies and made millions and millions of dollars. He would not have a beautiful, smart wife. He would not have a great job. He would have been in fucking prison. And it's not a God damn joke. People who smoke marijuana must be set free. It is insane to lock people up. Now, people bust me all the time for carrying on about how, I've never had a sip of alcohol, never had a puff of marijuana, never done any drugs in my life. They say, why do you always bring that up? Well, maybe in this case it's okay to bring it up. Okay. I've never had a puff of marijuana. I've never had maybe a little blow. I've never even had a glass of wine. All right?

Speaker 2:          02:10:34       None of that shit. But the people who do any of this stuff do not deserve to be in prison. Throw some numbers at me. Good. No, 750,000 people in jail for a victimless crimes. Uh, uh, uh, a great number of which are marijuana. One in six, one in jail are there for about one in six people. A victimless crime. Now when it's ignored, people in prison, one in six people in prison. What? Brilliant rent's six people in prison, hinge and listening. I those love the rent and if you want to listen to it, pendula at Sunday schools is fucking amazing. I want to meet him so bad. We didn't figure this out 10 years ago, but come on. That's a great, that's a great Rancho de wasting my time with the shift came to the talk to you while I'm talking to you right now. Welcome me about what?

Speaker 2:          02:11:27       It's a business. What the fuck do you want? Nobody knows prison is a business and that's what it is. It's a fucking business guides. It's important when a guy like pendulum, I said, boy, guy do for you break the fucking law. You go to jail, you sell weed. I guess the law in 10 bales, you get caught. You go to jail. I went to jail. I'm responsible. I learn how to fucking, that's it. What are you going to do? There's a law. You cannot fucking do it. You're going to go to jail. Jail and prison are a fucking business. They're a business. That's why you get a ticket driving with the phone. How much they tell you this, how much they tell you this, I don't know. $25 until you go down to La County and it's $225 because you've got to pay the court costs.

Speaker 2:          02:12:08       The prison fee, the judges vacation. It's a, it's a fucking business guys. They're gonna raise the taxes now, uh, for fucking parking tickets. It's a business. What the fuck you want me to do? This is the oldest conversation. The book, they should have legalized this after they shot Kennedy. They didn't. We fucking fortunate that we live in California and we don't have to abide by this. When was the last time you would've stolen? They kicked the door down. Joe Rogan. How about you my friend? So all this shit, you guys talked about them kicking the doors. The feds, I have never seen it. I go get weed every day. Stop scaring these fucking white kids and getting them talking. This is nonsense. This is nonsense talk and that they should kinda with Jim when I never drink it. So what? So who gives a fuck? It applies for everything going.

Speaker 2:          02:12:51       There's a lot of people who are in jail. They get out every day on a DNA or whatever. You break the law. You sell five pounds a week, you got to go to jail. It's a business. You didn't do nothing wrong, but it's a business. They have guidelines. If you get caught with dirty 28 grams a blow, you have to do a certain amount of fucking time. You get caught with a quarter rounds. So we have to do a certain amount of time. You got caught with it. Why are you crying to me for you got caught with, I was a criminal for 30 years. You ever, somebody gets caught with blow. We either blow. No, you follow me. There's a way to do it and as a way not pile. Fuck. Are you going to get caught with fucking weed and not think you're going to go to jail if you live in fucking Ohio and in fucking Kentucky or wherever you're gonna go to jail. I kind of see your point, but I also see his, cause it's a, it's an important mind. It's brilliant though. It's important. It's not together with Fallon and the presence hip or what? I don't give a fuck dog. You don't care. I'm smoking. Look, look. This is what I think about your whole drug thing. Looks like the same thing I've rubbed my balls with for the last 32 years with the sativas and the bullshit. Just get high dog.

Speaker 2:          02:13:53       You'd be playing too much drama to the gift that God gave us. A getting high. You got too much drama. I can't. I've got to put a Dang at the end of the joint to be cool. And even while you're smoking electronic cigarettes, he's fucking electric. What? I'm smoking it. Think about that. I'm smoking. Oh, that's all that matters at the end of the week. That's all that matters. Fucking people want to be intelligent all the time. We can't wait to share the stage tonight. Not fucking stupid rare form. And three out of four people in there for rape and murder. What do you, what are you telling me? Who gives a fuck? Who gives a fuck and to show people that you give a fuck. Who gives a fuck? I don't give a fuck. I don't give a fuck. I don't want people locked up in jail for weed.

Speaker 2:          02:14:36       You know what my favorite thing Joe, they came in here. Jack boot thugs. Marilyn fucking high your way for your little pencil comedian for 20 years. I drink from time to time. Did ever get behind the car when I'm drunk and got a Dui. That's a choice. You make these all the choices you make bro. So what are we getting at? I know it's illegal. I know it should be illegal and I know that John Lennon is going to make a comeback, but for today, but for today, 2000 tonight, but for today, if you get caught smoking and fucking in New York, you're going to jail. I don't care what you said, bro. I love hearing your talk. Fuck, I'm going to put up with this nonsense pendulum but will give them, I was going off yesterday, I was saying how Joey Diaz will get mad about ketchup because there'll be one thing it would just fucking Heinz Ketchup or ranch.

Speaker 2:          02:15:27       Oh, I fucking hate rant. I don't know how the fuck people delete that shit. I don't know how people could eat rat. I like when I go to a place and I say you all, you have wings and they say it comes with ranch. I get up and leave even if I don't get the wings. Because if you're going to serve wings ranch, I don't want to do business with you but I don't want to do business with you. I'm very easy. I'm very fucking easy. So if you fuck up pork fried rice, what are we got to talk about? Wings must be done with blue cheese. Yeah, like the wave they invented in Buffalo, New York and we got to do something. Who would original? You're going to show up with that rant. As small as like somebody is at [inaudible] ranch is starting to replace ketchup. Yeah, that's good. If you're a fucking hillbilly and you want to taste the ass in your mouth all fucking day. I hate that fucking rich shit. Don't put it close to me and I'll put it around me and see the blue cheese with wings and go fuck your mother. That's the next year. All right, please give me a fucking rat. Would fuck a wing.
