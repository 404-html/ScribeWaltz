Speaker 1:          00:00:04       Four, three, two, one.

Speaker 2:          00:00:09       Hey, what's going on? Hey, how do I get that quick, quick fix. Oh my God. It's so amazing how fast it came back to me. Like the addiction of playing that game over and over again. That it's a real problem. Yeah, we've been going crazy. Jamie has been fucking me up to. So today I got lucky that he had to help you get his shit together. He really killed that. He's been fucking me up. Yeah, you don't really play quake, right? You just from playing a fortnight and stuff. I tested myself a little bit because I knew that this was gonna happen eventually, so I had to get some practice with some rockets that at some point and yeah, but it helped. It honestly helps to warm up with quake to play for at night or play pub g or something like that because the quick whatever it is of aiming, you don't do it that much.

Speaker 2:          00:00:50       So like when you're doing it three times, you've already done it 55 times playing quake just in one round. So like your little interaction you have with someone a shotgun. Usually when so quick. It's so fast paced. Yeah. We're playing quake for. It's like Jesus Christ. I haven't played that game and maybe 15 years. See Two. You're ever going to do it again? I probably shouldn't, but what I noticed is my eyesight's sucks now. My eyesight is not nearly as good. It's interesting. From 42 to 46, there was a big dropoff in at 46. The fucking floor fell out. Now it's like my eyesight's Shit Gamer glasses. It takes me a minute when I play games to one game isn't enough yet. It probably takes 10 minutes, maybe less, but like to just start tracking things, getting your eyes up to speed. The distance you are away from that screen.

Speaker 2:          00:01:37       I'll all. It takes a little bit of time to get in there. Yeah, man, it's, we're right now we're just playing it on the local area network. But uh, once you start going online and playing other people, that's when it gets super, super addictive. People that still play that game must be insane. Oh my God. I don't want to be anywhere near psychopaths if they're playing that game. It's because they're really good at it. Probably, you know, like who else? Like young kids aren't buying that game. Back in the day you even had a Joe Rogan a level that somebody created. Remember that somebody created a level. That's right. Was that what game with three or four? I think it was for. Was it really for. Was 11 though, didn't it come out in 2011? Maybe it was three days. Might have been three wasn't it? Wasn't rock arena arena for.

Speaker 2:          00:02:20       I don't know. Oh my gosh, I don't remember. I don't remember. I know there was rocket arena for quake two and there was rocket arena for quake three because I started with rocket arena for quick two, which have you played today? You would think the graphics are hilariously bad, but uh, it's a good game. It's a little slower. The fast game was like quake one was really fast, too quick too, is slower and then quake three became more like quake one combination of quick one quick to do. It's pretty fast. Quick us. Perfect. Miss it. And you tried to play the new quake but you didn't, you didn't like it as much as that. The only problem is it's fun. We had a good time. The only problem is you have to do through their servers.

Speaker 3:          00:03:00       So it takes time. It's got a load and it's like, it's not. I'm inpatient, right motherfucking child. That's crazy. Yeah. You, you, you refused to try any of the other ones, right? Like they're all just new addictions, you know, waiting to happen. I just feel like if I got one addiction,

Speaker 4:          00:03:20       uh, this weekend on Saturday, they had a concert in fortnight. Yeah, marshmallow. It was crazy. Yeah. What does that mean? I think it's tough to explain what they had. It's called an event, what they're calling it. A second event. So at 2:00 everybody showed up at the game in this fucking concert started. It was all the avatars were together, like in one gigantic were normal mode, you know, you played at just like normal and then all of a sudden like two minutes to go. They took everybody's guns away and like you all just sort of congregated around the stage and the music started to show started. They started doing interactive things with all the avatars and everything and like 10 minutes later just it cut off, but it turns out it was actually live. He, he was tweeting about it all day because for promotion and whatnot. But people were asking like, how'd you do that? How'd you work it out? His voice was going live to everyone and was playing. It was probably millions of people and it was just normal dj voice stuff like, hey jump guys. Hey, what is it? They were just like, hey guys, come on. Like he wasn't interacting too much as much as he probably does during a normal set when he's playing to 20,000 people in Vegas or whatever. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:04:24       So when he does it, he probably has like a really good microphone to like, it's not like the microphone that you talk shit on, right? Yeah. Yeah. They had something else set up yet. When we first started doing quick known you had a type. Yeah, that's how goofy it was. You to. You couldn't talk shit. Like now people are talking like they're all in a group together talking shit. Right. I have a voice changer now too, but doesn't have talking shit. Get in the way. Like if you hear people talking, it gets in the way of hearing. Sounds like sound cues.

Speaker 4:          00:04:49       Yes. Yeah. Tell your teammates shut the fuck up. You can turn that off also. Oh, you can. I like to hear the footsteps going around coming around the corner and stuff.

Speaker 3:          00:04:56       It's makes it scary. Yeah. It's part of what's scary about quake is like you, you hear someone running grow and you know the right around the corner, you can control all that. It's all up to you. Volume settings and all that kind of very, very addictive game. So we should talk about this, uh, the Jack podcast because everybody got so upset about it and let's clear up a few things. First of all, the guy seems to be willing to talk about anything. It's not that I didn't want to talk to about those things is just he was being a, I wouldn't say he's evasive, but it was basically just saying what he knew based on the company policy. I didn't know what else more to ask him and people felt like I didn't press him hard enough and he to his credit, reached out to me and said that he would offer to do another one to ask more questions.

Speaker 3:          00:05:45       That's cool. I said that would be awesome. So I said, well, this is the thing that people seem to be upset about. It seemed to be upset about very specific cases where people showed. I'm like, if people were right wing and they were posting things, they were banned. Whereas people who are left wing or maybe people of different races or allowed to post racist things or more offensive things and even docs people and didn't suffer any consequences for it. This is the argument, my problem is I don't spend enough time reading this stuff. I don't know. Like this is like when people get banned. Like Anthony Kumi is a friend of mine. I don't really know why he got banned. I don't know what happened. There was that incident with that, that woman that punched him and he ended up getting fired. He was drunk and he said a bunch of really stupid shit on twitter and then later apologized for it, but I don't know if that's what got him fired.

Speaker 3:          00:06:40       Kicked off twitter. But he's my friend. So what I'm saying is all these other guys that have problems, I don't know what the fuck happened, man. I'm busy. I really don't. I don't know. I don't even know what got Alex Jones kicked off, which is why I asked him because that was one of the last platforms for Alex Jones was twitter, but something got him kicked off their take on it was it. They never kicked him off before because he didn't violate their terms of service. And another thing that's very encouraging that Jack said, and I know it's, it's fun to get mad at things, it's fun to get mad at him. It's fun to get mad at me for it. I get it. I'd probably do the exact same thing. I totally understand it, but one of the things that he said was that he believes that the ability to communicate on the Internet through twitter or through these platforms is a basic human right.

Speaker 3:          00:07:30       That's how he looked. Like I said, do you think of it like a network like NBC, like if you're on NBC, they can decide what's on and what's not on, or do you look at it like a utility? And he specifically said that he looked at it more like that, that he thought it was a basic right. That's very encouraging. He also said that he would bring on whoever it is in his team that's responsible for these things so we could hear from the actual person who decides who's getting banned and why they're getting banned and what is. What's the decision making behind all of these things. So we can go over all of them. I didn't think the podcast would create such a controversy, but that's probably poor prior planning on my part because my thought about it was, hey, I want a fucking crazy to be running twitter.

Speaker 3:          00:08:22       Like it's crazy that this thing exists. The president uses it as a platform. I want to talk about the dude who created this and what does this like to have this thing evolve to become what it's become because it didn't start out that way. It started out like fun shit like at Brian red bands going to the movies, you know what I mean? Like that's what people used it for. And then along the way became this global method of distributing information where people use it in war zones, man, they use it to, to tell people where attacks are the user for all kinds of crazy shit. It's like a, it's a really powerful but strange medium. I didn't think about getting into the weeds with all the very specific people that got banned. I just wanted to find out why they banned people. That was my take on it.

Speaker 3:          00:09:05       I know there's a lot of conservative voices that have never been banned. I don't think Steven crowder has been banned. I don't think Cernovich has been banned as he'd been banned. There's a bunch that have not been banned. Right. So it's not like they banned all right wing voices. So what is it? I don't know what it is. I think it's what he said. People reporting the tweet and then somebody looking at it going, well this does violate our policy and maybe you know, all these people that that got banned violated the policy somehow. You know, it's probably as simple and clean as that. You know, it's, it's not that simple, right? Because they make their own policies and it's also not that simple. If people are allowed to say similar things that are very racist in vast generalizations about white people, which seems to have been the case and at least a few instances where people reported that people said fucked up things about white people, but there was no repercussions.

Speaker 3:          00:10:05       And you know, that's where the argument becomes. These people are more oppressed and so the white people were thought of as the oppressor, so you have this white privilege thing that people love to use now as a reason to to decide to like silence someone like check your white privilege. That's a. that's an interesting thing that's happening, so if, if there's this genuine movement where people think that it's okay to say things about one race, whether you like it or not, that's racism and if you're allowing that from any one side and not allowing it from another side, it seems hypocritical. Look, it's very distasteful. The idea of racism against black people in this country is very distasteful to everybody. Almost everybody who's not a racist, right? Because of the history of this country, because of slavery, because of all these things. It's a different connotation, but if you just allow people to say terrible things about any race, it's racism.

Speaker 3:          00:11:05       You are allowing a, like a predetermined attitude about a race. Some people have done this, they have made generalizations, generalizations, a racist statements about white people. The really weird thing that people are thrown around these days is that you can't be racist against white people because racism is about power and influence. It's about using your. You're in that black people are not powerful to white people or power from the white people were the ones who are oppressed, so it's impossible to be racist against them. That sounds like horse shit to me. I'm not buying that. That doesn't make any sense. It's not beneficial to anybody to generalize. This is what we got to get it in our head. It doesn't matter if you're black or you're white or if you're whatever the fuck you. It is not beneficial to generalize, to take a person out of the group that we think of as just human individuals that you have to be an individual.

Speaker 3:          00:12:05       I mean, I acknowledged the fact that people look different. They have different heritages as the heritage. Iss, they have different, different ancestry, the different occupations. There's different parts of the world. There's all these differences, but at the end of the day, the only way we're all going to get true equality and true kinship and comradery as human beings is that if we recognize we're just all a human being, that's it. There are very big differences in the way we look and the things we like. That's cool, but as soon as you. You can say shitty things about white people or white men, that leaves everybody who doesn't fit that description guilty in this weird way or presumed guilty because of a racist statement. That's all it is. It's not good for anybody. I get it that it's different than racism against black people in America, a country that was built essentially in a lot of ways by slavery.

Speaker 3:          00:13:03       There's a war for slavery in this country and that it is a crazy reality that it's not your responsibility. It's not mine. I didn't do it. You didn't do it, but it's real. Therefore, as a person who's aware of his history, the history of this country, racism against white people seems different, but it still sucks to be racist against a racist against black people. Rather, it seems different, but it still sucks to be racist against white people. Sucks to be racist against Puerto Ricans. It's not good. It's not good for anybody. It's that's what we have to understand about this social media thing. What actually did happen and what is happening, why is it happening, and if it's just some social justice warrior ethic that you're not debating, it doesn't seem fair. It seems like there should be a conversation about this and I bet they're super reasonable, really intelligent people and it's possible they can come to a good place that we can all agree to.

Speaker 3:          00:13:59       That is possible. I'm not a cynical person. I'm sorry. I know a lot of folks who just want those that just want the guests what they already have it. They have more money than they could ever spend and my dealings with Jack as a person, he seems like a very nice guy and a very smart guy and and a very empathetic guy. I just think he's in a crazy unmanageable situation to be running something like twitter. Yeah, and there's probably people that did something that they should have done in terms of silencing people moving things around. It's probably happened. It's a weird thing when people have influence over people and there have been videos had been proven. We're executives from a bunch of different social media corporations have talked about how to silence certain voices, how to push down certain voices. Um, this is something that needs to be discussed.

Speaker 3:          00:14:52       Like is this a policy as a whole? Is it, you know, is it because you think you're pushing the right message as soon as someone thinks they're pushing the right message but they don't have, there's no debate about that, right? They just decide our way's the right way and they're pushing this and there's a radical opposition to that message from half the country like that, but usually like, no, no, no, but this is the one that's in control. That narrative. This is the one that's in control of social media. It's this far left leaning ideology and the other part gets pushed aside. That's a very bad situation for all of us because there has to be conversation, there has to be debate because if there's not, it's just shores up the differences between two people and they fucking hate each other even more. I did not take that into account and I fucked up.

Speaker 3:          00:15:42       That's my mistake. That is my mistake when I made that podcast, but I didn't take it easy on them because I didn't want to discuss those issues. I just didn't think enough of it in advance. I'm not as involved in it as other people are. I'm aware that there censorship and social media. I'm aware my. My ideas going into that conversation were more about how insane this method is for distributing information for the people that have been banned and for the people that were fans of the people that are banned. I can understand whether it be upset at me. It has nothing to do with any preconceived notions that I had is just how the conversation took place, so all it is, and if you felt let down by that, you didn't feel like it was an extensive enough. I'm more than willing to do it and go further into it and we're going to and Jack offered it and he's going to bring someone else who's gonna explain things to us.

Speaker 3:          00:16:36       I think this will be very beneficial for everybody. I also think that there should be a road to redemption. I think if you've got something that's important as twitter or facebook or instagram, if you're not stealing someone stuff like, you know, using copyrighted music or something on an instagram page where you get banned over and over again for doing it, but you keep doing it. If it's not something like that, if it's, if it's, uh, an ideological difference. If you maybe you crossed a line that they, they decided was align, you should be able to work your way back. You the should. There should be a way where you can sign up again, meaning, like get a new email address. I don't mean that I be the same person. You should. You should be able to be the same person. There should be a way where there should be different levels.

Speaker 3:          00:17:23       Definitely everybody. People fuck up, man. They fuck up. And they make mistakes, right? And people also grow. I mean there's this guy that was on Sam Harris' podcast. I'm Christian ecoline I think is his name. He was a fucking white supremacist, a full on white supremacist and now he is the exact opposite. He's like this very progressive guy who gives speeches on the dangers of racism and that and the idle ideology, how it caught up with him now if he got banned when he was a young man and making terrible decisions and then became a better person. Shouldn't we give it a guy like that? A chance to get back in a platform? Right? And without making a whole new screen name, like maybe it would be. And I don't think there's anything wrong with the anonymous model. There's some things that are really good about it, right?

Speaker 3:          00:18:15       Like people like Jack even talked about this, that people can report news stuff and not worry about fear of retribution that they can. They can whistle blow and not worry about fear of retribution if someone's life is on the line, but they're trying to provide a service to the general public or they're trying to give people information that maybe might even save lives but could put them at risk, especially in like third world countries or war torn countries. That can be a huge problem if you have to post, you know Brian Red Band, this is the only way you can get this information out. You have to use your whole name, but it probably be better off for everybody if people had a way of communicating with each other like it's just person to person and I think the real problem is when people try to engineer these conversations, and this is another conversation about youtube.

Speaker 3:          00:19:10       People have said that we're deleting comments on Youtube. We're not deleting anything. We haven't deleted any comments. I don't know how it works. I don't read them. I'm sure people say mean things. Have a good time. The thumbs up, thumbs down thing. Look, we we, we don't have to have that on there. You don't have to have comments on their youtube gives you the option to have comments on and to have the thumbs up, thumbs down. I'm not taking those off. He could have a good time with it, but we're not fucking with that. There's something that they're doing that's not. It's not. I post at 3:41 and Jamie posts it 3:42 and this is the line of the comments. It's not like that. They've got their own way of doing it. The question is why does youtube do it? What's their what? What are they trying to do is are they trying to block out spam?

Speaker 3:          00:19:59       Are they trying to block out hate speech or are they trying to engineer conversation? Talking about comment, order comments on note, comments disappear. They go away. A lot of times it's automatic. If somebody flags a comment that just take the comment away until it's like looked over upon only one person. Yeah, on. I think on youtube that that happens quite often. Probably be as little as one or two people. Yeah, so that is probably what's happening to all you folks that think your comments are getting deleted. No one's deleting shit. Look, I'm. I'm not attached to what I do in the sense that I'm unwilling to look at what I do wrong. I tried to look at everything that I do wrong in concluding this, so if you were upset of this podcast because you thought somehow another I sold out because I didn't ask him anymore questions.

Speaker 3:          00:20:46       I just asked the questions I wanted to ask. I understand you have more costs, more questions, and I do too. I have more questions too, especially upon seeing people's reaction to it and upon making myself pay more attention to all these various stories. Matt sent us a list of them. Some of them are really fucking crazy. There's some crazy things people have said and not gotten in trouble for. Whereas other people said things that really weren't that bad and got in trouble for it. Why is that? That's a good question to ask, so we'll. We'll concentrate on that. We're just going to work out a date, so my humblest apologies to all of you. Don't not trying to let anybody down. I always try to do my best. That's it. And, and also here's another clear one. No one tells me what to do. There's no one, there's no secret person behind the scenes.

Speaker 3:          00:21:35       If I fuck up, it's because of me. It's my fuck up. I should've prepared more. I should have thought about it more, but I didn't realize like how upset people would be. I think he did a great. I thought it was a great interview and I didn't even think of that. I thought you kind of touched on it a little when you were talking about Alex Jones and I think that was like, okay, you know, this is what happens. Well, it's a very specific group of people that are upset. Right wing guys is, there's a lot of American flags, a lot of pepe the frog. It's all right. People, which look, man easily could've been me at many points in my life easily. Especially being a troll online. You know, if you're working in some fucking job and you make him pepe the frog memes and you're fucking with people, I get it.

Speaker 3:          00:22:16       I get it. It's one of the things I like about the internet, like I don't, I don't want to be comfortable. I'm like, I don't, I don't want to be comfortable all the time I want. I want a little bit of chaos. I like the fact that there's people like, they're like that fucking. I was upset that that radio, that podcast, they took it down where they were fucking with Shiela bu with those guys from four Chan and the way they took it down was they contacted radio lab and said those guys are white supremacists and they support white supremacy. You know, and then you just, you know, you made these people that are awful, terrible people that write terrible things. You, you, you gave them props. But the thing about something like four Chan is no, you might read some terrible things, but you've got to realize you're also reading terrible things from anonymous people that are working at their jobs most of the time and they're trying to fuck with people's heads and the trying to get people upset.

Speaker 3:          00:23:06       They're there. They're having a good time fucking with people if you want to take them as that, that's like them, like giving, giving a talk to a dear friend or them giving you an affidavit in court. Well, you're missing the whole thing. It's entertainment like half of the whole reason why they're doing it is entertainment. They didn't go steal shiela booze flag and go and go right into the camera and go fuck Shiela. Bu By using coordinates from photographs of the sky where they figured out where the fucking with the constellations lie and then drove around honking their horn so that they could locate where it was by using the Webcam and listening to how close they got to it. I mean it's fucking genius shit and it got taken down just by this accusation of them being racist. But the thing about a forum like four Chan or Reddit or anything, you have so many fucking people.

Speaker 3:          00:23:56       You have 3000 and thousands and thousands of people. If you have 10 clients posting jokes about black people, that's all you need to ruin the reputation of thousands of people. So for someone to say that everybody that was like, fuck Shiela, Bu is some racist and the white supremacist, that's a cheap way out. That's a cheap way out. I bet. More likely it's some duties board and he's sitting in front of his fucking computer and he works all day and this is where he escapes. He escapes and types in writes things. Then check some later and then it goes back to and type thing and checks and it keeps him sane and the stupid fucking cubicle. That's a lot of the people. So they pulled that whole amazing podcast down because of that. Look what He. The Shiloh booth thing was ridiculous. He will not divide us. Come on, stop.

Speaker 3:          00:24:50       Stop. We get a chance at everywhere. It's funny what they did. They mocked something that's their way of mocking it. Nobody got hurt. They made it out like it was really awful crime. They committed on this. This amazing person who's just trying to change the world. No, no. They prank Ceaila Boo. And they said, fuck Shiela bu this is that as of the above, whatever it is. Shiela buff special. He's a nice guy too. He probably did something silly. It's a little silly. He will not divide us. What they. What they did was funny. It's a funny reaction. I. I liked that. I like that this is an important part of this thing. If it wasn't for people like that, there would be no podcast. Now the like to dislike ratio that you see on youtube videos is fascinating, right? Because it's weaponized and they're thinking about trying to ban that now because so many people use it to fuck with people. I hate to say this about you folks, but every time we have a chicken here, they get fucking torture. The like to dislike, right? Like it's ruthless. Except Rhonda. Patrick said

Speaker 2:          00:25:56       Rhonda Patrick, but it's just like it's weaponized. It's the. They're just going to dislike it because. Because it's fun because it's fun because it's fun. It's also fun to throw a rock at a window.

Speaker 3:          00:26:06       It's fun. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:26:08       Some of them probably didn't even watch the podcasts like thumbs down gives them a disliking. It gives a little bit of power and the algorithm ofd ranking. It affected something and people who liked it, there's a probably a lot of them that didn't even watch it. There's a button you can press. People are weird, you know, but it's clearly it shows by the amount of dislike. The people moved on it and they were upset about it.

Speaker 3:          00:26:29       So it's basically it. We'll see.

Speaker 2:          00:26:32       There's a lot of cool, interesting questions that to ask him. Like I always thought shadow banning was a real thing, but I think he came out and said that that's not a real thing. I've, I've seen it in my, in person where I'll type

Speaker 4:          00:26:44       somebody's name in and usually it's splits to come up on the searches, but it doesn't in our

Speaker 3:          00:26:50       planning is if it is a real thing, like that's another one, like shadow banning for what? Like if it, if it's not something that is. If you're not doing something that you could get kicked off the platform for it. Right. You're not kicking them off, you just pushing them down. Weird place. But if you're doing that, like why are you doing that? Like what?

Speaker 4:          00:27:09       Because like, but what would be the justification from the ones that I have seen three used to even be a website that you could type in somebody's user name to see if there are shadow bands, so that's kind of interesting, but a lot of porn stars or shadow banned because they don't want. If you're looking up Christina applegate, they want Christina, you know, apple bottom or something like that. You know what I mean? So it's, it's, I, I, I still believe that's a thing, but I'm pretty sure he came out and said it wasn't a real thing. Technically shadow banning Justin Bieber from the trending topics. Right. I mean they have publicly said that that's not a shadow ban. That's a strategy.

Speaker 3:          00:27:41       Well, no, they were kind of forced into it because Justin Bieber was so. His fans trend so hard. They hashtag the shit out of that thing and they just took over the trending.

Speaker 4:          00:27:51       That's probably happening for other equally popular celebrities too, like Taylor swift's and beyond time.

Speaker 3:          00:27:56       Yeah, yeah, yeah. You're probably right. You're probably right. So whatever they're doing at youtube with comments and whatever they're doing with twitter, here's the real conversation, right? The real conversation is, do we want that? Do we want them to cure rate? Do we want them to decide whose youtube videos you can subscribe to and who do they unsubscribe people? Is that real or is that a glitch? I. Yeah. Who knows? I don't think they unsubscribe. I don't think so either, but people have. Well, let's listen. If they're willing to move justin bieber from the number one trending because he'd number one trends too hard and they think it's ridiculous. Not to just acknowledge that our culture, there's certain humans in our culture, we're spending an exorbitant amount of time thinking about that. Beautiful Man, right? There's a lot, but why do we want to lie and pretend that it's not as big. So if they just. I'm not saying they shouldn't, but if they did that just. If they did that, you go, okay, are we through the looking glass? Now you can change the data. Like what? What do you lend? When do you decide who gets pushed here? Who gets pushed there

Speaker 4:          00:29:05       side? Definitely the trending page on youtube is 100 percent controlled by a human. I don't know if they've said that, but there are videos that should be there that aren't based off of the data. You see Youtube has got some weird things going on with it. Like there's a. The video is that they go, you might like type thing. They did it. You might like to me a couple months ago where it was just videos of a guy towing cars in dallas like out of their parking lot and he made these funny cute little videos with a little commentary using videos from the security cameras. Anyways, I don't know why I it, but I started watching it and I was like, you know, this is interesting. So I tweeted it out like random video I just got addicted to on Youtube. Everybody was like hundreds of people who are like, I just started watching that.

Speaker 4:          00:29:52       Youtube recommended that to me. Like how did that happen? You know, this little guy with a tow truck company has now pushed on everybody's laps and now he just went over 100,000 subscribers the other day and it was like months ago that he was just had like 10 that, that. That's the argument some people have made that that's how fast the Paul brothers, they grew and they grew so fast on youtube that some people thought there was something up that game like millions of followers within a week or two of being on there and then they were coming from another platform.

Speaker 2:          00:30:18       Well it's also coming from another platform is giant, but it's also all it really takes is one person deciding that whatever the fuck you did was funny or weird or crazy. Like that cashew outside girl.

Speaker 4:          00:30:31       Yeah. Well there's that girls are managed by the same people that own tmz and that's why you see it on tmz every. I was going to bring up, if you want to fire the fire festival documentary, there's a, an explanation of this show. How this, uh, they spread of the Fuck Jerry guys, the marketing team spread that with the orange picture. It was a coordinated event over hundreds of different social media accounts for her, for the cash me outside girl. For the FYRE festival. Yeah. Firefox to catch everybody's. Because there are a team of people. There are agencies that have all this influence or accounts. They paid them. They don't have to accept the money or accept the offer except the campaign, but oftentimes they do. So it's like a talent agency. One hundred percent. Yeah. Yeah. Interesting. I don't need to share a new person, you know, launch the next, the next voice, and it's like, oh, here's a new song. There's a new movie. It's just a new way to suppress stuff. It's pretty cool watching how many people are unsubscribing to fuck Jerry and the fat Jew though. That's.

Speaker 2:          00:31:26       But are they? I looked at the other day was the day of like $14 million. 500,000 dollars a week. Weekend real estate, a significant amount of time. I was 14 point seven then it was 14 point one. Haven't looked today, but that's coming from I think of video. Someone to shared this week. I think vic Berger made a video that got spread around and they took his video. Right. I, maybe that's what he said. I think I saw it on burgers page. Here's a few comics I've posted videos like, hey, you know, fat Jews stole this, you know, and I tried to reach out and they never got back to me. He got 10 million. What do you think about this idea though? Like that's kind of piracy, you know? And so instagram's allowing twitter's allowing piracy. Well I think they're allowing these people to post videos because you don't really know where it came from.

Speaker 2:          00:32:15       There's no proof. Right? Like if you find a meme, like how many times he posted a Meme, I pee, I repost whoever sent it to me. If someone sends it to me, but sometimes I'll just find it in a google search and you've got to figure out who made that meme and if I find their instagram account that I'll try to find it and repost it, but some people don't and I haven't in the past. Like I did that one with a baked Alaska got mad at me because there was one with Alex Jones sitting in hot tub

Speaker 3:          00:32:40       and it's uh, it's like when your friends are trying to chill and, but you have to keep dropping truth bombs. It was hilarious. I didn't know it was his right. I just posted it because someone said to me, someone sent it to me in a text message, I think. But those things have a creator. Right. And I know Pete, like Eddie Bravo makes his own. He makes them sometimes, but he'll send some to me or post some online that he finds that are funny too. And everybody tries to credit the person who did it right. But now what they do is they, they take it and they credit the person, but they didn't

Speaker 4:          00:33:14       for so long. They only attempt. They're accrediting fake accounts. So they'll make, they have. So they're not getting busted in the way. You're just explaining. I've seen that too. Well, what is that about though? Because that seems like deception. It's just the way around the back door and that that qualification of it needs to be on an account. We need to point to somebody, okay, well we'll point to this account, but it's not even a real account and if they find like they'll post stuff and then later add the person because the person contacts them and they're almost like that's admitting to piracy like we did hire because if they just reposting it, a lot of folks including me do that. Yeah, but they're making the person making money or not.

Speaker 3:          00:33:51       Yeah, that's important. I don't make any money off my instagram. Right. They're making millions. I've been offered to post stuff up and I'm not saying that I wouldn't. If something was fucking killer and they wanted to give me money, I'm greedy. I'll take some money, but it wouldn't lie about it. I haven't yet. I've never accepted any money yet.

Speaker 4:          00:34:14       Yeah, because it's also, I think in instagram's a law that you have to put that it's an ad if you're making money off of it and so that's another thing that both fuck Jerry and fat Jew or not doing. They're not putting the cad is. I just wanted like to devil's advocate this though is is there a place for them for those accounts? Like is there a place to be the re tweeter have the means to be that guy to be that account, you know, like isn't that valuable source? It is a curator position.

Speaker 3:          00:34:42       Yeah. It's kind of valuable. But the question is like if it, if it is valuable and it becomes something almost like redistributing your standup. If you're doing a set, like if standup sets where you know something that you just, you could get everywhere and you could just repost it on your page but then your page becomes super popular because you are all these people stand up sets. You know like spotify, spotify gets ads right? But they don't really. They pay the artists a little bit, but mostly they make all the money.

Speaker 4:          00:35:08       Yeah. And you know like if it's, you use like say sorry later, you just do it and say I'm sorry, we'll figure it out after the fact. Or you figure it out. Business oriented things that have art in them as opposed to art

Speaker 3:          00:35:21       oriented, things that start making money. There are two very different things, so this is not an art thing. This is a. They find other people's art and they sell it. They're pushing it, they create these accounts. The accounts get giant. People pass it around because they're just finding funny things and then they start profiting, but all the people that created all the intellectual property gets zero money. Which is weird. I don't remember, but I only learned more about this when exit through the gift shop came out. Isn't that what Andy Warhol sort of did? I don't know and I don't care. I mean maybe he did. Maybe he did, but the thing about it is that this is happening right now on the Internet. It's a totally different animal. I mean, Andy Warhol wasn't running around taking exact photo duplicates and putting them on his website for sale like these.

Speaker 3:          00:36:08       This is when someone's doing on an instagram page is like you could within seconds take a piece and put it somewhere else. It's seconds. Brian posts something. I think it's funny. Ha, I go to copy, I go to the fucking repost at a APP, I put it in there, I'll repost it. It's seconds later. You could do that all day and if you hire kids, I don't know if he has people working for them, but if these guys do, they hire people for fucking 20 bucks an hour or whatever and these people just do it all day long. They just find funny shit all day long. They look for certain hashtags. Meme factories or what they're calling. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And there's some people like, you know, that have made some funny ones all their own, you know, a lot of people that are just doing that all. I know Dalea has done a bunch of them and then there's also one that they do where they steal people's act and make a meme out of it and then posted it on their page.

Speaker 3:          00:37:01       That's where it gets even more slippery because you're talking about like standups acts that you're, you're making money off it. How much are they making off each post? I mean, I don't know, but these are multimillion dollar business and the punchline, so now you have this 10 minute joke that everyone has the punchline because they saw it on facebook. That's like, spoiler alert one for sure if you're still doing that material because it wasn't on Netflix or a comedy central special or something. For sure. That sucks. I guess it's always happened though, hasn't it? TV shows have been accused of stealing a stolen. It's happened on. Do they did it to Kevin James? I saw it happen. Kevin James was at the uh, he had a development deal for NBC back in the, a back when we were young pups. Both of us were like 27 or some shit.

Speaker 3:          00:37:48       Maybe he's a little older than that. Maybe it was actually, that was like during the news radio days, so we're probably like in our thirties and he had this development deal, nice development deal. They're paying them a lot, a lot of gas, a lot of paper and they were setting up a sitcom around him. So they had him do a set at a theater in Hollywood and I was there. And he does this set and has all these writers from various sitcoms and the very next season, one of his best jokes is on an episode of a television show that's very popular. Very popular. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And uh, they fucking stole his bitmap. I guess that's where I was going because that was in the nineties. So like we're now 25, 20, 25 years later. The popular medium

Speaker 2:          00:38:36       is instagram and social media different is that.

Speaker 3:          00:38:39       Well, it's different because there's accountability now because now people know that if you wrote a meme and you put it up on your site and then fuck jerry comes along and steals your shit and doesn't credit you for it, just puts it up there. You know what they did, unless someone sent it to them and didn't attribute it to you, which is possible, but it seems much more likely that what they're doing, they were doing on purpose for the longest time. And they just did. They thought that's what you could do on the Internet. It's a wild west. You could just take memes and you can become famous and looked at fat Jewish guy, did it. I mean that guy became famous. What whether you agree with his methods or not. It worked. He got his crazy hair. He shows you, you know, like he's just crazy looking guy and he has all these funny memes that somebody else wrote and they're all up on his instagram page and it worked and people don't like him.

Speaker 3:          00:39:30       Now there's a lot of people that don't like him. People will get real shitty with them in person. They don't want them to do an appearance because they know what he did. So there's a certain number of people that go, hey man, you're a thief. Like this is not cool. Like what you did is not cool. But then there's certain people that don't care and then there's certain people that think, well, what he did was just what anybody did back then. It was the wild west. No one thought about it and once he established that business model and it was effective, it was probably very hard for him to slow it down or to attribute things to people or to admit that he didn't do it for all. That amount of time

Speaker 2:          00:40:05       just bugs me that companies pay these guys knowing that they do this or like as a Jew, he's like, see, he's signed with caa who's signed with a bunch of comedians they probably took, you know, they're taken from the same basket. So it's like, it is weird, right? Yeah. Now if he was going on stage and doing their acts, she's been doing appearances. Right. He's got a book. He's been on TV shows. Well, I don't know. I don't know what he's doing. He's doing by maybe showing up, but he's. Look, he's obviously used it for profit. He's figured out a way to profit. It's weird. He must be weirded out by this fuck jerry thing too, because you might be. Must be sitting there going, okay, all right, here was going to leave me alone.

Speaker 3:          00:40:46       It's, um, you know, comedy central was advertising on the fuck Jerry page, which is like Jesus folks. I didn't know that. Yeah. It was like Jesus folks, can I just sit you guys down? Go over a little history.

Speaker 2:          00:41:02       Sure. Comedy. Well, I mean it might've been car. They didn't learn that either, you know. Well that was while it was happening, you know, they, they did learn eventually they let it go eventually. But that was also because the ratings have dropped through the floor or

Speaker 3:          00:41:15       you know, comedies on fucking easy to make up, you know, especially like meme kind of comedy that's done by folks that are working in offices, meme kind of comedy, some of the funniest fucking comedy on earth. And it's done by regular people. It's not like a, it sound like most

Speaker 2:          00:41:34       memes are written by high level satirists that worked for the New Yorker. No, they're fucking regular folks who think something's funny. You know, I think what's going to happen is that as technology improves, the like being able to scan a photo and go, well we could tell the first time this was ever put on the Internet with from this little girl, she took a photo of it has all the data in the picture and that's now used on this mean that's making this much money in this game. Then it's gonna be kind of broken down like a, you know, any kind of artists. Yes, yes. I mean the idea for the buyer and the argument for the block chain getting involved in here because we could tie that. You can, I guess it can be in the data and the bins like. No. Let me ask you this.

Speaker 2:          00:42:14       What if someone uses a picture of your band, so you have a band, they use a picture of your band and then they have a funny meme under the picture of your band who owns that? Then that's what like, I think beyonce tried to get that picture taken off the Internet from her from the super bowl a couple years ago because it was like a bad picture. She didn't like how she looked in it. That's hilarious. Yeah. That's how the fuck is that lady to take a bad picture. I just, she doesn't talk to her. Go listen. It's good. It's not your best, but you look fucking great. Like if that shit was on tinder, you know, you wouldn't be on like did it? Who? If someone was paying for that meme should be onstage gets some of the money or that's. That's the question you would have with like a corporation.

Speaker 2:          00:42:56       Right? Which should someone be able to grab photos that are out in the public domain, make something with it and then profiting. That's the, that's. There's been a lot of bands. I'm sure that that's why I said bands because they're like really good at protecting copyright and their logo and shit. If you had like the kiss band logo, you don't think gene Simmons would come at you. He's coming at you with some lawyers, 100 percent, right. That's just what he's going to do, but it's who owns those photos? If it's like Gene Simmons, like spitting fire out and I think if you took the photo and the cameras were allowed inside the event you took it, but it's not for what the cases though. Most of the photographs or people that are putting out there, just putting them up online and someone takes it. It's like say if you gene simmons spitting fire and then it has a joke about eating hookers, pussy or something like whatever it is.

Speaker 2:          00:43:43       Like make something funny there. If that's online and that becomes this giant meme that gets all these likes and that somehow or another someone, how the fuck do you profit from you? From instagram? You don't profit from individual posts, but those individual posts will boost your signal. Yeah. Some posts are profit. Instagram, you have to say add on it to say sponsored post, right? Yeah. What legally exposed to, but I'd probably say 90 percent of them aren't. Right. A lot of people don't write, especially if it's like instagram is you can get away with it. Instagram models talking about t I e s t, eh? Yeah. It's a whole instagram model is a fucking hilarious position. It really is. Powerful position. Yeah. It's hilarious though. It's, it's amazing how many of them there are and they make money. No, it's smart. It's amazing how butts are such a big thing now.

Speaker 2:          00:44:38       Yeah. And like when I was a kid that no one cared about butts. It was big. But you're like, Ooh, listen, wait. Yeah. We talked about this before when I said let's start mixed a lot of change the game and everybody's like, oh you like big butts. Hey, I kinda like for whatever reason, it wasn't even an issue back then. Girls would have giant fake boobs and tiny flat butts and they were perfect. My grandmother would have millions of instagram model hits. Fat bottom girls was before that slightly, but no one really. It didn't make the rock world go round. That's a great God damn song. I didn't see Bohemian rhapsody. Did you? Did you see it? I heard it wasn't that good. What the fuck are you guys talking about? I heard it was amazing. Did you? Yeah, I did. I'm a giant queen fan though.

Speaker 2:          00:45:25       I love them. That's my number one cryogenic song when I'm in the crowd chambers dragging attack to do because you got to move around when you're in that 240 degrees below zero. It's hard to just sit. Still do a little dancing in there. Uh, he did a rainy Malik, I think is the, the actor's name that played him Freddy Mercury. Oh, good job. But before it happened, Sacha Baron Cohen was sort of in talks for it, but you wanted to take the character in a different direction that no one was really comfortable with it. I would've rather have seen that. No Man. What does that mean? That's a weird thing, man. You can't because it's been said to that get spicy talk, but you can't just add stuff. My wife an art piece like Bohemian rhapsody, although it is an art piece, it's a documentary of a guy's life.

Speaker 2:          00:46:19       Like in some ways you're documenting it right? Like it's supposed to be his life, you can't make up things that never really happened or I forget what movie, but it's like a, it's the difference between like a bio pic and an actual biography or documentary. Like what is the difference you're making a Hollywood movie versus. But what is the difference in terms of the story creative? I think creative control. I like being creative with some. Like we know this event happened in this event, happened that day before and in the middle. What would happen where one one is knowing all the facts, the foxcatcher versus a documentary about Mark Schultz parts in there that you specifically know. Yes, we're fucked with for no resistance sake. Not just the parts that I know, but I didn't even talk to mark about the movie, but there was a bunch of parts that I think he was furious about where it made it look like they were doing blow and maybe doing some gay stuff. It looked, it was, uh, it was, there was a lot of weird scenes that things were implied or just seemed odd. Like, how do you know this happened in less mark told you? And so, and mark was furious at the end, uh, after it was released. And then on top of that, I like the big one was that they changed his opponent when he fought in the UFC. They gave him a Russian guy when he in fact fought big daddy

Speaker 3:          00:47:30       goodrich who's a legend, like big daddy goodrich's an MMA legend. He was a pioneer. He was in the early UFC, the giant yoked black dude with the Geeky. I mean he would fight with the guy. He has one of the most brutal knockouts in the history of the sport where he fought this wrestle. Paul Herrera and Paul took him down and they got into a position where a big daddy goodrich was lying on him sideways and he elbowed him in the face like 10 times in the course of like three seconds. And it's so horrific. You watching his head just bounce off before they stopped the fight. It's fucking brutal. Like one of the most brutal Kales you'll ever see in your life. So this guy wasn't a just a regular guy like you just substitute them out and make the guys named Tom Instead of Bob. No, it was big daddy goodrich.

Speaker 3:          00:48:24       That's who mark Schultz fought when he fought in the UFC. Watch this, watch this. Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. I mean that guy is cop out and his arms are trapped in his legs. A trap. Big Daddy's got him in like a, a like a crucifix position and it's from Paul tried to take him down. I mean that was a. So that guy, big daddy goodrich is a. he's a famous fighter. It's not like they took some nobody and removed him from the movie and changed the name of someone where it was. It didn't really matter. It was a historical event in mma. That's the reason anything.

Speaker 2:          00:49:04       No one knows. Some crazy producer. I think you should fight the Russian guy because this is. We're in the cold war again baby. I don't know. You boot and I don't know how you feel about politics and some producer. Just one of the judges on the soup. Some writer just wanted to cup his own balls, squirt one off into the fucking stew. That's probably what happened. Yeah, the screenplay to make it to watch better. Who knows? The only other thing that makes sense is maybe they would've had to pay get daddy goodrich. Right. And they didn't want to pay him. Maybe. I don't know if that makes sense. That makes sense. I mean like Mike Tyson, you know, he had that video game a long time ago with Nintendo and they had to pay him to use Mike Tyson's punch in, punch out and then after like a couple of years he was like, I hadn't done like this in.

Speaker 2:          00:49:48       So now it didn't. It was just called punch out. It wasn't even Mike Tyson in the game anymore day. Like take it off. Some new dude. Yeah. Have you done the Vr boxing game yet? I haven't done the Vr boxing game, but it looks cool. Like the rocky one. Is that what it is, is a whole bunch. A whole bunch of them too. They're amazing. Yeah. It's like a regular boxing game. You playing on TV is so stupid. I mean they're fun, but in comparison to a vr game, in a Vr game, you're boxing, you're, you see your hands in front of you, the guy's throwing jabs, you're slipping, you're like standing in front of them. You can catch punches with your hands, you can throw shots to the body. It's crazy. You get tired doing it. Like you could really get a workout doing it. It's amazing.

Speaker 2:          00:50:28       And this is it right here. Like this, what you had sent us, the new rocky when they just updated clubber Lang. Mr. T's in it or is it just random guy with Mohawk? Well, that's clubber Lang. But look, look how everybody is. Imagine if people were really that Jack Town. I mean this is. So what does that Drago and he's fighting. There's drago versus rocky. Yeah. But we can't see. You want to see what it looks like from your eyes. And this is a, um, that's a regular video game or that is just for testing of the. And this is just a teaser that showed. I guess I was looking for the updated. You want to see what it looks like when you've got those gloves in front of you. Have you tried Vr pull yet? No. No, no. I like regular pool. Vr are so great.

Speaker 2:          00:51:13       I love it. I just need to get it out of my living room. It's just too much for my living. There's things that you couldn't do with Vr pool that you need to understand. If you're actually playing pool with real pool, you need friction. Wow. This looks great. It's crazy because it looks nice. It looks a little bit of haptic feedback for this to get maybe the next step to look how he's using his hands to block too crazy. The thing is, man, when when someone swinging on you, when this fake person in front of his friends, it's nerve wracking. You think you're going to get hit and when you do get hit and you see red where you see white rather, you just killed them. It's funny watching the guy. It's pretty amazing how vr really gets immersive like where you were like the resident evil video game.

Speaker 2:          00:51:58       I mean, that's scary as fuck. You really think zombies are coming after you. You. Yeah. You really do. You know that game. The thing about that game though, it doesn't necessarily. Boxing thing does not necessarily reward perfect technique. It's just you could kind of just do this and do that. So you'd have to like be. If you wanted to use it as a workout, you'd have to actually be disciplined and use good technique. Well you'd probably do is put gloves on, put some velcro gloves on and put the, the, the little fucking hand thing glove close to. They're better than the next year. Two. You can just duck tape it year or two. It'll be in the glove itself. Yeah, there's actually a, I think it's called the knuckle controller is the next version of the vive controller. It fits around your hand like a glove. It's not just goes around your neck if you don't have to grab sort of in the same way.

Speaker 2:          00:52:43       Right? Yeah. Cause um, when you have your hands this way, like with thumbs up, thumbs up shows the gloves like this on the screen for some strange reason. So when you're throwing punches, it doesn't look right, they need to change that, but other, because they, it's like they want you to just do this, but that's freaking me out. But when you're actually doing it though, if it looked like your hands in the same position as your hands, it would be a worthwhile way to learn. Like a guy like Freddy Roach could literally do a game where he showed you, all right, I want to see the gap right here, right here, right pop. And then here comes the hook, duck under, and then we'll go to the body, go to the head, and you could do that and do drills

Speaker 3:          00:53:26       with a guy. And actually you could pick up real skills in a vr game, especially with boxing, boxing, particularly kickboxing, maybe a little less because you're moving your legs, you're not just moving your hands, like you'd have to have some sort of sensors on your legs so I can know what you're doing to make sure you're not showing bad technique. Like your knee might be down or you might be doing something funky. But if you have boxing, those two things are just like gloves, all you need to learn as all the other things you need to learn how to punch it out and move around, but you can effectively with just holding onto those things, you're, you're staying in the same position that you would be if you were really boxing and you can move around the ring too. Like it's a, it's an area like the size of this desk maybe like a little bit more so it's not like you're in one place and you don't have footwork. You could actually develop footwork too, so they can have like a facility Loma Chanko doing like footwell drills, footwork drills rather where you would learn on a virtual reality thing, where to step, that'd be fucking bad ass. All that stuff that you could learn some shit from those things.

Speaker 4:          00:54:29       I like how the Vr is. There's an amusement park or a buildings now, kind of like chuck e cheese where it's just vr rides now we're just like, oh, you're a parachuting or you're on a rollercoaster and stuff. I like how they're doing that now. A lot of malls have that

Speaker 3:          00:54:44       now. Yeah. Yeah. I've done those. I've done the little spaceship ones too. When you roll a Dune buggy around on the surface of that.

Speaker 4:          00:54:50       Have you done the star wars one in Vegas yet? I guess you actually have like five people in your group that you can see in the game and there's like a, you know. Have you played at the Glendale Galleria? They do, yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:55:02       Do the dopest one they have. Is that the Disney land? The same Disneyland village, but the Disneyland village one is. There's a start star wars one and then there's also a wreck it Ralph one. The record. Ralph one is fucking amazing. Is the same company avoid? Well yeah, that's it. Same place. So they have the star wars one sometimes, so they'll have like one game set up for like a couple of weeks and then they'll have the other game. We went to Disneyland and that was the dopest thing. It didn't really. Yes. By far. Fucking amazing dude. You wear the suit. Okay. So you have this vest on, so you're feeling when you get hit, you feel in your chest, you feel heat. They have moved places where you walk through and it's like lava below you. You feel he was the star wars one.

Speaker 3:          00:55:47       When you're getting shot, you feel it in your chest. No Shit. You pick the gun up off the wall and you've got like storm trooper arms. You see you're holding the gun in front of you. It's crazy. Awesome. I didn't know that was in Glendale do. They're getting so good. This still. You still are super aware that you're in a game for now. But this, you know, go from Pong to fucking what's the best red dead redemption. That's probably the best graphics. I mean fucking insane graphics. That's what does that 30 years, 30 years they went to that these virtual reality games, 10 years from now are going to be insane. No one's gonna want be in regular life.

Speaker 2:          00:56:24       Regular life's going to suck. Yeah. There's not going to be at Disneyland or Disney world anymore. It's just going to be vr. It'll still be there, but you'll be able to get on every ride.

Speaker 4:          00:56:34       I haven't watched this myself yet, but the MBA makes a viewing and vr available now. Not every game, but it's like once a week they have a particular game you can. You can log in and watch that. They changed the cameras a little bit. I don't think it's perfect yet. Holy Shit. Very cool though, Dude. Like watching this on the floor. You're on the floor and they'll. But they'll move you around so you can sear in the footage to it. I think they have a separate announcing team, so they're. They're talking about what you're seeing versus like listening to the normal TV. Quite not there yet. We filmed a couple episodes of kill Tony and Vr and we had some of the top of the line cameras for it and still wasn't there yet. It was more hassle than it was worth.

Speaker 2:          00:57:16       This seems like something that would be fucking amazing for the UFC though. Oh yeah. I mean this would be a major basically have your view. Yeah, except you. The cage. The cage would be in the way, but there's gotta be a way that they could film through the cage if they just had a camera in a reinforced position where it was far enough back behind foam that there's no way it could interfere if someone crashed into it but yet close enough that it could see through an actual hole. You could get the entire octagon if you did it with several. Several different ones. Are those

Speaker 4:          00:57:53       they had or they had it at least at this, isn't it? I guess, but it was a ground level. I think they call it the Phantom Cam, but maybe it had a different name and it was vr. It wasn't vr. Know the UFC is used it a few times. They always try out things there. They're very experimental. They don't always show everything they're trying out though. But problem with. Cool to try. Maybe one time. Ideally you'd want it right in the middle. Like not above or two below. Okay. And it would have to have because it has cameras all around it. So

Speaker 5:          00:58:21       you know.

Speaker 4:          00:58:24       Now that's hard to do with the cameras. I guess a without getting in the way, if everything.

Speaker 2:          00:58:32       Yeah, you'd have to. You'd have to find a good spot for it, put it on a burst buffers head and let him just go to town. Well, they used to do that with pride. Pride used to have like they would wear glasses with like cameras next to the glasses and you'd get the referee vision. Yeah. It was crazy. It's cool separating fighters and breaking it up and waving the fight off. Yeah, that's Kinda cool. Yeah, it's pretty bad ass. Yeah, it is. It's A. I guess it's just a little team. Marshall camp is what? It's going Pov Cam, but that's just point at me, man. Sometimes. Yeah. There's one like that that's pointed at me. Oh yeah. I guess. Sure. I have seen that there. Yeah, they use that sometimes when you know, when we go crazy when we jump up fights happening. I didn't know that was even. I didn't know that's what they did it for until one day I saw online. I go, oh,

Speaker 3:          00:59:21       that makes sense. That's a smart thing to do because sometimes we do get animated. There's been several fights were me, anik and DC or dominick Cruz. We're all standing up like, well, while the like the end, like Amanda Nunez when Amanda Nunez knocked out Cris Cyborg, we just, we were like, what? Like your whole body is like, she's us. What the fuck did I just say? Sometimes you just can't sit down. You just, your buys just like God damn it. It just goes. You don't, you're not even trying to control it and you just let it go. When you see somebody do something fucking insane. Like there's some wild crazy francis in Ghana knocking out Alistair overeem type punch. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:00:06       Yeah. It's me and Dominic and John Eck and annex up and I'm leaning back. It's crazy job, man. It's crazy job. So that was the moment. And you see the one below it. See that? Go back to that. So that one below it where I'm staring at the camera in the upper right. I know that froze up video taken by John Wayne. Par. John Wayne Parr who is a multiple time world champion and friend of mine, a great guy who lives in Australia, was there at the fights in Australia when Holly Holm knocked out Ronda Rousey and he filmed Holly Holm head kicking Ronda Rousey and then turns to me and I turned to him and I was like, what the fuck just happened? I was like, Whoa, whoa. But when you see it, like in that moment when you see, when you see something that, that fucking nuts in that moment, you're like, oh, I can't even believe what I saw.

Speaker 3:          01:01:04       That was mailer. I looked at him and he looked at me and were like, Whoa, dude. That was crazy. There's no sport like that. Some sports just, you know, they just have this moment where everybody gets a jolt of a drug. You know? Everybody just gets it. I mean, that didn't happen last night at the Super Bowl for you. I left before it ended. I was at a friend's party, went to a superbowl party. It was fun. The lowest viewed one in the last 10 years. Are you serious? But not by a lot, but yeah, it's because they knew that that handsome man was going to take your shirt off. Oh Levine. It's beautiful man. No nipples, nipples. Now he has a Nice Brown Nicholas. But then we're like Janet Jackson, like the big crazy. Why is he loved shows nipples. So both. This is bullshit, sexist bullshit. And his Dick Route. This is. Oh my God. He had decreased showing God is bullshit. He just wanted. Everybody knows he's got beautiful tattoos and a fairly good body. Doesn't move. He does a lot of squats though. Right? That's what's interesting. He's around like the greatest super athletes in the known universe. Actually. It was pretty good. Right for

Speaker 2:          01:02:20       today. He was pretty good in those. Random for today was. I mean, he's not always around the greatest super athletes, right? No, no. Yeah, yeah. Um, yeah. It looks pretty good. It looks like he's in good shape. Happy to take your shirt off with this California stomach tattoo. But the point being that guy is around, he's around six foot five, 290 pounds super athletes who could jump over his fucking head. They literally could run through 100 of him, like they were paper walls, just raw. That's what he's around. He's around the fucking super bowl, the greatest physical specimens in the known universe. And he takes his shirt off like, hey bitches, I'm here to. They had an event set up over the weekend. Uh, some people could test their 40 speed up against other NFL teams, whatever. They had this hilarious Hussein bolt did it and it's in his shoes. They said street shoes or whatever. But she didn't have cleats on. He tied the fastest ever. NFL 40. He's probably did with a full stomach. It probably just a track a couple of beers. Fuck it. I'll show these bitches what's up?

Speaker 2:          01:03:30       Yeah. It's just, it was weird like watching on tv, it's due to shirt off, like, oh, this is a different thing now. Now this is like a sexy concert for. It was like a football and that's what I think he's getting shit for it because he didn't need to take a shirt off. Right. You know, he, he, he had his shirt on and then like after the second songs, like, you know what, let's get sexy in the super bowl. No, no, but I mean, why else would you take this shirt? At least make it Hashtag. Hashtag sexy in the superbowl. Gets sexy up in this bitch. Well, he's a sexy man. Can't, don't be hating. Beautiful Man. Yeah, I mean, but. But that's the whole thing that your audience is a bunch of guys jacket on with Jack and on. Well, it was cold out at first, but then he started to warm up a sweat.

Speaker 2:          01:04:14       Never trust white men with Nicholas's. That's my message for the one now he's got the little necklaces and the bracelets for the falcons land on. Wait a minute. Those are spiritual Nicholas's. If you have wooden beads for whatever reason that makes you spiritual hemp or gold. I can't even tell you allowed to wear necklaces because like people go, oh, you like really indoor ganache stuff really into macro, but that's gold is gold. Yeah. That's the other one was just a weird lighting. I can't wear necklaces, man. It bugs me. Did you ever wear necklaces? Necklaces? Sure. Yeah. It's never been a staple, but it's a, it's a, it's a weird thing if, first of all, if it's, if it's big enough, it's like this target, right? If you have like a bill gold necklace, people want to steal it. Right? There's a lot of Nicholas snatchers out there.

Speaker 2:          01:05:02       Brian, I don't know if you know that. Yeah. But then the other thing is, uh, like what are you doing? We're doing with that big old shiny thing around your neck. Are you doing. What? Are you a chick? Remember it in the nineties, chokers were thing and I used to wear a choker. How gross is that? Like dog choker, just a really tight necklace. Yeah, hemp necklaces. Oh yeah. Those were the little bead. The bead at the bottom. The beads. Critical. Kind of have the bead. Yeah, multicolored bead. Think over. You're cool. Yeah. Like, it's weird, like, like some guys will wear like little anklets with beads and they tie them off and they'll walk around barefoot and you're like, okay, what's kind of like that? Look that you're not shop. Look where you have like the really tight, like your pants go up so you can see your socks, you know, you show a little leg. You know why they do that or sneakers. Those guys show off the sneakers. False. That's what she told me to do that Jamie. That's what my parents have that actually for it.

Speaker 2:          01:06:03       That's how the uh, that's funny. That's how the pants are made. You don't buy those pants, man, that you're not buying pants. Where do you buy your parents? Lady store. Do you buy? Do you buy it at coach? Do you buy those pants? Icu Doc on? Gosh, that's hilarious. Do you don't do that too? You know? How dare you, how dare you have a pair of a very comfortable underarmor running shoes on? How are those trouble? That was in your shoes the other day. Um, they're a little too tight for me. Okay. They bind my feet a tad bit. When I got to the store, I had to swap them out for A. I had a pair of converse all stars, which you might go to. You Got Yeezys right? Jamie gave me a pair of yeezys about a year ago and he just to talk to them. You just keeping them on ice dead.

Speaker 2:          01:06:45       Socked him. Is that always called that stock dead stock. Dead stock. Oh. Do you know a dead naming is? Do you know what dead naming is of? No, no, it's a new thing that's illegal on twitter. It just something I wish I knew I didn't know until after the podcast, but dead naming is a. it's banned. So say if you decided tomorrow to become a woman and you're like, I'm not no longer Bryan. I'm Bryan INA Brianna. That's what have you thought the servers. So I'd be like, okay, Brianna, but you're still a man. And then boom, that's deadnaming you can't call someone something other than their preferred gender. So like if that identify as a woman, but their biologically male, you're not allowed to say their biologically male, uh, you're not allowed to call them a man because that's deadnaming. You not allowed to call them.

Speaker 2:          01:07:40       Like you couldn't call Caitlyn Jenner. Bruce. If you called her bruce, you'd be dead naming her. But that's just like, that's not illegal or I mean like, oh, it's winter rule. If it is a new poll, please pull that up. I did not know this. I did not know this. It. It's been around for awhile, but I'm checking the twitter. That's kind of weird. Dead Name. He has been banned for a while or don't know. The term term has been around. I just found out about the term maybe a couple weeks ago. I had heard the term for the first time somebody wrote dead naming and I was like, what? What is that? And then I had to look it up. I saw the new rules. We have to deal with that fucking article. There's an article that I was reading. Go ahead. I'm looking right at their terms of service. It's directly word for word in there. Okay. Where's this?

Speaker 3:          01:08:27       Okay. Dead naming of transgender individuals repeated or nonconsensual slurs or epithets? Racist and sexist tropes or other content that degrade someone. Okay. Well hold on a second. Like what does degrade someone? So if you. If you contact me and say, hey bro, you're fucking short. You're not funny. That's degrading, like is that not allowed? That's crazy. You have to. You have to have that be allowed. We are targeting individuals with repeated slurs, tropes or other content that it tends to dehumanize, degrade, or reinforce negative or harmful stereotypes about a protected category. See, that's where it comes from. Like white people are not protected. This includes targeted mis-gendering or deadnaming of transgender transgender individuals. Oh, I love how they just went with the giant corporation and they just went with some new word that's only been around for like a month. How long has deadnaming been around for

Speaker 2:          01:09:33       the urban dictionary? Had It in there from 2014. He never even heard that, but they're on the ball. Tell you that, but you to stay ahead. Twitter still allows goat season and all the porn you want. It was interesting to me. Yeah. Well, porns consensual. I love that. That's hilarious. I love that. That's all. I love the. I love the chaos of it all. I love the fact that

Speaker 3:          01:09:56       trying to sort everything out. I just think it's. The whole thing is crazy. It's so bizarre that they're trying to, in that sense with that like that's so vague to dehumanize or degrade what every joke about someone, every joke about trump, every single joke about trump that every single comedian and slash or commentator in or person makes is in some way degrading. When you talk about how fucking stupid. It's like Rob Reiner had a joke about him, called him a piece of shit or call them a piece of crap yesterday and said he couldn't believe how fucking dumb he is.

Speaker 2:          01:10:34       Trump talking about hillary though. He's doing it to him.

Speaker 3:          01:10:37       Percent. One hundred percent. One hundred percent. So that's so vague. That's so vague

Speaker 2:          01:10:42       and dead naming is not a real word. So like how are they using fake words in this?

Speaker 3:          01:10:49       They're trying to say it is now. It is a real real word. Yeah man. I don't know if your name used to be bruce and you change it to Caitlin. I can't say that. That seems bananas. That seems bananas. So like if you're fucking with somebody, say somebody became a woman and it's still an asshole. Like you can't call him Mike, you know. Hey Mike, look, I'm sure you're bitter about this whole changing your sex thing. You can't bring that up. But uh, you're still an annoying guy. You just don't have your deck anymore by like if someone says that they can't say that, why can't they say that they should. That's to me stupid. Why? Well, I'm not saying that that's hurtful, I guess to transgender people and that's can be considered hate speech or hate whatever but own. But only when it comes to like gender, right? Like if you could tell someone, hey, you're short and fat and stupid and they don't. No one cares. True. Right? You could say you, uh, you're ugly as fuck your noses. Disgusting.

Speaker 3:          01:12:01       What happens there? Is that the same? What is it the same thing? It might be if you do it repeatedly, right? If, once you just throw one out there, probably. Okay. Probably one time you could shit on someone's looks. But it's like what? Like deciding what you can and shit on someone for like what I'm saying is if someone's an asshole and they're like, here's a perfect one. That woman who used to be a man, she's transgender woman who was in a store screaming at this kid behind the counter that it's ma'am, it's man, this is a perfect example of that guy was terrified. She's fucking huge and she used to be a guy and clearly still looks like a guy and she's saying it's fucking ma'am. Like you mentioned, knocked some shit over. She got violent. Yeah. In that situation you're telling me that it's not cool to say, how about you settle the fuck down because you look like a guy. You're acting like a violent guy and you used to be a guy. Pardon me if I think you're still a fucking guy

Speaker 3:          01:13:03       that's deadnaming. But that's a good thing to say in that particular instance. So without nuance, right? Without context, it's saying you can't say anything to degrade someone. Well clearly that would degrade that guy, but if that guy was saying, fuck that kid, he did it on purpose. On twitter you're saying someone can't respond, hey man, I'm sure you're really upset that you got your Dick or moved and these still look your guy, but fuck you. Like why can't someone say that? Because that's people communicating how they feel about you being a dick. Like if you start out being a dick and then they communicate about you being a dick by being a dick as well. Are we banning? This is the product is covering their butts and there's probably not like of like Jamie said, it's dangerous in a lot of ways. It's dangerous to control people's thoughts and behavior because who are you to say and when does it end?

Speaker 3:          01:13:51       You know? It just keeps going and going and going and going. It gets. It gets very slippery when you have one group that thinks it's right and they're trying to control another group that thinks they're right. Man, that is a. it's. It seems so simple when you just talk about deadnaming transgender people or not degrading people based on their or their ethnicity or their this or that, but what you're doing is you're trying to dictate how humans communicate with each other and people don't like it when you tell them what to do. The problem with telling people what to do is they want to do the exact opposite is one of the first things you realize when you have kids like, oh, they don't want to listen to me. Like I got to figure out a way to sneak information into them. You know, or you gotta you gotta figure out a way to not be too bossy.

Speaker 3:          01:14:34       People don't want someone telling them what to do. This is what I missed when I was editing, headed into that conversation. I missed how other people looked at that guy and what he stands for. I don't think it's correct. I think it's way more complicated. I think it's an insane business to run it. I don't think he really knew why Alex Jones was band or anybody else has been. I don't think he really knew. I think he's dealing with a giant corporation and he's a young guy anywhere. Sandals titling company here. Wait, wait. What kind of Sandoz is a weird ones. Like the Nice Guy. Let's just choose. He runs a couple of different companies. He's not. He's not sitting at twitter office. That's another thing that Alex Jones brought up today that he sponsors the podcast through the cash app, which is also. He also runs 100 percent true, but I would have, and I think we talked about it on the podcast.

Speaker 3:          01:15:26       We even talked about the cash app being a sponsor and about how it's helped. Justin wren is fight for the forgotten charity. So Alex Jones erroneously said that I didn't mention it, so we did mention it. It's worth mentioning and Alex Jones is a having to like respond to people that want to know if I've seen what Alex Jones has said about me lately is one of the weird things that I have dealt with because first of all I've always had good dealings with Alex in person, person to person, but he's obviously in a world of shit right now. There's a lot going on with him with the sandy hook stuff and he wasn't entirely honest with me about what he had said about Sandy Hook. Maybe he didn't remember. Maybe a. He was trying to phrase it in a way other than the way I interpreted it when I saw the videos, but there is a media matters video that shows all the time where he said that Sandy Hook was fake.

Speaker 3:          01:16:23       This is a very complicated. To me, this is one of the reasons why I struggled with bringing him back on the podcast. That's very complicated. It's that is. Even though I've known the guy since 1998 and if I'm around him, I'd say that's my friend Alex Jones. He's a friend. He's awfully. He obviously did something fucked up and the parents that had to deal with what he did. There's parents that had to deal with people calling them a crisis actor. They had to deal with people harassing them at the courthouse and harassing them if they met them in public because they were saying that they were lying about their kids being killed. So not only are their kids being killed, but they have to deal with someone harassing them and saying, you're a liar and you're enactor. It's insanity and I wouldn't. I would think about it differently.

Speaker 3:          01:17:16       I definitely think about differently if I wasn't friends with Alex, but I would also think about it differently if he hadn't made shit up about me. He said that I was told to stop talking about conspiracies are they threatened my family that's 100 percent horseshit and he has my phone number he could have called me. I called him after I heard about it. He told me that someone told him that. I told. I talked to the person who told him that I'm like, this is fucking bananas. Like you out of your mind, call me. This is so stupid. You think I'm not talking about whatever. Fill in the blank. Whatever. Ridiculous conspiracy, the rothschilds, the Rockefeller's, whatever it is. I'm not talking about that because the government threatened my family. That is fucking wrong. It's ridiculous. And now you've put it out there. So Alex Jones went on afterwards and he apologized and corrected it.

Speaker 3:          01:18:08       Then recently, because I haven't had him on the podcast, he decided to start saying that I worked for the CIA and that, um, uh, George Soros talking points, which I don't even know what these fucking talking points, our talking points about him and specific not talking to anybody. No one's giving me talking points, not George Soros, Eddie Bravo has been saying he wasn't good. He got good information. Even say that. So stop. Joey Diaz did fuck with it for awhile though. But, but the point being, the point being Alex is you're out there. I still like you as a person. If I saw you, I'd still give you a hug, but you're making shit up. And this is, this is not helping anybody wants to defend you. It's not helping me as a person. Talk about the good qualities in you and you know, the, these things that you're saying are made up.

Speaker 3:          01:19:01       You're making up the fact that I'm in the CIA. You're making up for the fact that the Hollywood insiders have given me information and tell me what to say. That's not true. You know, it's not true. You know me. I don't have time to be a CIA insider. I can't take on another job and between doing standup and podcasts and UFC commentator, running a family, I can't do it. I wouldn't do it. I'm not interested. I'd rather stop doing everything than work for any government organization. No one's ever approached me. No one's ever approached anybody I've ever heard of. I don't even know if that really happens. I don't know if that's a real thing. The thing is they always say is that the CIA would talk to the people in Hollywood and tell them what to say in terms of propaganda and maybe. I don't know.

Speaker 3:          01:19:48       I don't have any personal knowledge of it. I'm sure someone has decided that if they're going to make a movie about like zero dark 30, that they have to get some sort of approval and I'm sure that a lot of movies that are very inspirational that have to do with the military would be great for recruitment. So I'm sure there's some involvement. I'm sure there's also some patriots that work in show business that want to put out these movies about the government and about the military in a very positive way. That's probably the case in some instances too, but not everything's a fucking conspiracy and this is why it's stupid. It's stupid is some things are fucking conspiracy. And Alex Jones has talked about some things that were real conspiracies, that nine slash 11 documentary, the road to tyranny details the world trade organization protests where they sent in these agent provocateur tours that which are essentially soldiers.

Speaker 3:          01:20:43       They send in soldiers and military people dressed up in all black and cover their face and they smashed windows and tip over things and they take a peaceful protest and they turn it violent. So then the police can move in and shut down the protest. And then not only did they do that, but they made a no protest zone. And the United States of America, uh, no protest zone. Was it the United States of America? Wasn't Vancouver, was. It was Seattle, I think Seattle coover. No, I think at Seattle World Trade Organization protests template with the boots and they all have that shit, but Alex detailed this in detail and it was real when he makes things up. Like there was one recently, the David Pakman show had on about Alex talking about people eating babies pituitary glands and scattered vandalism of downtown Seattle. Yeah, seattle. So the enforce a no protest zone. That was in 2009 in 1999 rather.

Speaker 3:          01:21:39       Was It [inaudible] 99. December first 1999. The October 27. Two thousand nine was the article. Yeah, Alex did that. That was real. That was legit and it was very informative because I didn't know that that is how the government operates sometimes. Did you contact him the second time and go, what the fuck are often. I send them a text message, so this is why I won't talk to you. You say crazy stupid shit like this, but I don't hate the guy. He's, you know, he'll scream and yell and call me a demon. He's not a good place. You're not in a good place when you're defending against that. And what all these other conspiracies, like it's all fun and games until you're talking about people's kids getting murdered and then all of a sudden people are like, fuck you. And that's basically what happen with him.

Speaker 3:          01:22:22       If he was just ranting about government conspiracies or you know, who shot this guy or who's stealing money from here. Some of what he talks about is beneficial. But Alex is not. I don't think he's in a good place. I don't think he's in a good place mentally. And I don't. I don't think he's in a good place in terms of his situation with the law. Don't hate you. Alex Jones. If you listen to this, if I saw you, I'd still give you a hug. I'll still even do your fucking show when I come to Austin. I don't care. You can, we can come and hang out, but just stop making shit up. It's silly. And you know, I'm sorry if there's bad stuff between us. A more. Sorry of what you said about those kids. I'm sorry about everything. It's, it's unfortunate. It's all terrible now. Something like that. What's the road to redemption for someone like that because some. This is the thing about people is, and I think this is also what's going on with Alex. people need a road to redemption. Like if if someone fucks up horribly and does something terrible, should that be the end of them? This idea that we don't need them anymore, no matter who it is.

Speaker 3:          01:23:36       I mean what? What does a person have to do to grow and learn and for people just accept them again and lead them on to all platforms again. What, what? What does a person have to do? It's a real good question. I think it's

Speaker 4:          01:23:50       per person though. Like somebody like Alex just seems like he's getting worse and worse. Like this seems like what he did teach us. You mad at me because I haven't had them on that. He, I'm sure to you he asked you or if he was in town?

Speaker 3:          01:24:03       No, no. Do you not listening? I said I didn't want to have them on one. I was trying to figure out whether I would have him on, but when I watched the media matters video, it was very clear to me he wasn't being on. I asked him if he had said that it was fake and he said he questioned whether or not it was real, but then eventually he acknowledged that it was real, which he has done, but there was many times where he said it was fake. Not One, many times. It's absolutely fake. It was 100 percent fake. There's video of it. I didn't see the video before. We did our nine slash 11 podcast. I've seen it now and I still thought about having them on. I still thought about talking to them about it and talking to them about all this shit and what it's like.

Speaker 4:          01:24:44       I think it's. He plays a character. Honestly. I don't think so. I mean with the reptiles guys and people and the things that he says, none of it. Half of it's just like, what the fuck are you talking about?

Speaker 3:          01:24:54       I think he. He definitely goes, goes crazy with some things, but I don't think he's doing well, but he was talking about eating babies. Pituitary glands were found fondant. David Pakman video. David Pakman, who's a progressive, a commentator online. He, he was going, look, something's wrong with him. Like he's playing this video, like what he's talking about them breaking into

Speaker 4:          01:25:18       what is happening in the Alex Jones. Yeah. See if you can find the part on the video where Alex is talking. It's early on. It sounds like schizophrenia. It sounds like any episode of live pd or cops and people are talking like, I saw aliens upstairs in my house, you know, like the other guy, Owen Benjamin, look at him, see, play this place real quick.

Speaker 6:          01:25:37       It's all in plain view of these people. They're just putting it in our face. They want a system where we can't do anything to stop them. That's like Bill Maher, the name of his production company as a kid. Love, which is enabled slogan. Basically. They make jokes about having sex with kids all the time and she says it's okay to have sex with. You know, kids don't have section 35 year olds when they're 12, just incredibly evil, pathetic stuff of these solas demons like Bill Maher. But Josh was saying he had a theory, the only one walnut saw says USA. It's the pituitary gland because they confirm that Jimmy Chevelle and others would a torsional kids to death, but they couldn't get regular ones to kill. Her favorite thing was to grab a kid, run over with the car so they could say, oh, there's a police report. They are run our. But they would hurry to the morgue and they work with different, different government controlled morgues and eat the pituitary gland as quickly as possible, uh, and, and, and get high off of it. So yes.

Speaker 2:          01:26:41       Yeah. That's this. First of all, Bill Maher's done a fucking pedophile. This, this is crazy. This is like a weird rambling and this is not alex that I knew from 1998. So it's not, it's not the same guy. This is a guy who's not doing well. So my apology, um, as a human being to Alex Jones, if uh, you were hurt that I didn't have you back on the show if you were hurt that I occasionally poke fun at you. I have to. You're hilarious unfortunately. But, uh, I don't hate you. Don't wish you wish you badly. And uh, back in the day I enjoyed a lot of your stuff. People lose their way, you know, so I think that, um, it's a real bad feeling being stuck on the outside too when they all band together and kick you out and everybody kicks you out. Everybody, twitter and facebook and everybody and Youtube and twitter was the last one.

Speaker 2:          01:27:46       But uh, that was Jack Dorsey didn't even know why Alex Jones got kicked off twitter and people like, well, let them back in. Then like, yeah, but somebody knows somebody. Like, I don't think Jack Dorsey is really the guy who's looking at each individual person that gets banned. I just have a feeling that that stuff is compartmentalized. Right? I told you 100 percent, 7 million monthly active users. Right? But how many people are. I'm responsible for banning people and real high profile people though. I'm sure there's a whole, like maybe 12 people. They have to have a meeting. Then they, you know, maybe they talked to Jack, maybe they don't. Maybe they, they position who. Yeah, right. He, maybe he doesn't. We don't know. I'll ask that for sure. But maybe he didn't know when people got banned until he liked maybe got accompany memo. Maybe he wasn't involved in the course.

Speaker 2:          01:28:36       Maybe. I don't know. Maybe he's the one that called them up and said, get rid of this motherfucker that's possible too. Like, here's another one, right? Here's one that people had an issue with. And one thing you could say, okay. I'm like, uh, when Kathy Griffin held up the, the, the trump head, remember that? Um, did she do that on her own twitter account? Uh, yeah, she, yeah, she, well, she, a photo of it. When she posted, she posted on instagram or twitter. I think it was on both. I'm not 100 percent sure. Right. So that it's A. is it allowed? It's allowed because it's newsworthy because it's a celebrity and the celebrity is threatening a public figure who is also the most powerful person in the world. So it's. Okay. Did that, why that is. I think she posted it because it was an art piece that was kind of controversial.

Speaker 2:          01:29:29       Oh No, no. I know that. And that's what I'm saying. Why are saying why is it okay? Why is she still allowed to be on the platform? And Alex Jones case kicked off. That's a, it's an interesting question, right? Like, what do you need to do to get kicked off? Because that's not the only thing that Kathy's done. Um, recently she was one of the people that was calling for the name for that young boy who was, um, with that native American in front of his face beating the drum. She's crazy, irresponsible, you know, I'm sure she feels bad about it now in retrospect, especially if she's watched the video, but you got carried away and she thought, what we all thought when you saw the picture that smirking can't have a kid that got in the face, this beautiful indigenous man is singing his, his rain dance cry or whatever the fuck he's doing.

Speaker 2:          01:30:10       Yeah. That's not what it was though. We found out afterwards it was much more complicated. What is their song? What were they saying? Sounded cool. They should make a record. Yeah. Do you like that shit? That shit's cool to listen to. When you work out, if you could get like some, some legit native American chance like that puts you into a trance. Right? If you don't know what they're saying and you just go running and you listen to that. Took a little couple tokes. Go for. Go for a jog in the woods, listening to native American chance on your air ponds. That was an interesting video though because I mean I was a one 80 after just hearing the second side of the story, like 12 hours later people still were calling for that guy's head. Yeah. And people. I saw someone who said, um, what's his name?

Speaker 2:          01:30:56       Ron Perlman? No, who's the guy who was a hellboy? Ron Ron Perlman was like, motherfuckers telling me that I'm not seeing what I'm seeing. And she said something about some white prick or white motherfucker. I'm like, oh, okay. People try so hard. Like you, you are seeing what you're seeing. You're seeing what you're saying. Well, you're not seeing is a video that shows how it occurred. That's all it is, you know? So why is that? Okay? Right. Why is that okay? Why is it okay for some journalists to say horrible things about white people? Why is that okay? Why is that okay? It seems weird. What if it encourages violence against a innocent white person? Just one should be responsible. What if they say, why did you do that? Well, I read Blah, blah, blah as a tweet. And I was like, you know what, I am going to go out and punch a white person. Fuck that. I just found some white old lady and I beat her ass. Like if someone decides that you're not responsible for that or yeah, probably not. But you kind of feel

Speaker 3:          01:32:00       like you played a part in the way people look at things, especially people that are very easily influenced, you know? It's just also, it's gross. He reads something really racist against white people. You're like, that's gross. Like you think all, all people are like that. A whole group of people that don't have as much melanin. They're all shit. That's ridiculous. You're ridiculous person. I don't care if you're brown or black or yellow, you're ridiculous. That's silly because we have to decide.

Speaker 3:          01:32:28       It's got to decide like what the fuck we're doing. If we keep letting illogical behavior be normal, like breaking us off into fucking groups like that and thinking that you know, all men are great or all women are great or all gays are great and never all straight cisgendered men can go fuck themselves. All right, that's, that's silly talk. I don't care who you are, you're not allowed to do that, but we let people do that. If they're a part of a marginalized class, if someone's a part of a marginalized class, then you get to shit on everybody. In a weird way. You get to like reinforce racism. It's really. It's so fucking counterproductive too because if you do that then it just makes people just get defensive on the other side. They don't even want to even think or empathize with how you are.

Speaker 2:          01:33:16       What social media has really made. Everything annoying has made me think great too though. Both do twitter is like we're saying when someone says something dumb like trump will say something dumb sometimes and I'll just go there for the memes and I'll just read his post and it'll get me going in the morning. I'll get like 15 minutes of [inaudible]. Probably missed the story yesterday. Have you heard any of the 21 savage news? Oh, you got deported, right? Because everyone found out yesterday that he's apparently from the UK and so like the story. There's two stories that as part of the story, but memes of him being from the UK and the British rapper that's rosie from Atlanta really took over to the fact like Demi Lovato tweeted it and she got shit on and she's deleted her twitter now because of the response to that. Did you know who this guy was before?

Speaker 2:          01:34:03       No, but I'm 51 years old. Yes, man. Number one, like Oh shit. Number one, write record. And now like in the country. Really? But Jamie's on black twitter, twitter. But you're on black twitter. Sure, sure I'd be. I. Oh yeah. My father. A lot of them. I don't know any of these. Tech Nines and Sushi for fucked that. Takeshi. Six nine. He's fucked. Maybe. What do you mean? Maybe he's talking. He's still fucked. He's. He's fun. He's going to jail for a long time with a tattoo of six, nine on his face. He's going to jail. Who's going to have real problems? That ain't good. You read the list of charges. There's murder involved. Murder conspiracy of him supposedly calling a hit on someone. Oh Jesus Christ. Oh my God. Oh, he's fucked.

Speaker 3:          01:34:54       Even if he cooperates, if they put a hit on someone because he said it,

Speaker 2:          01:34:58       Jesus he'll hear, won't get like the death penalty, but now he'll be like life in prison or you know someone's fleshlight. Yeah. Heck yeah. It's a real problem. Soldier boys in jail too is. I mean it is. For what got arrested. Did he beat up his girl and his girl beat him up? No, no, that was a little bit while he's son of a bitch. You just shamed soulja boy for no reason. With your shitty pot. Adult memory, right? I know. It was a little bow. Wow. No, there was something else. Hold on. Yep. Is Accused of kidnapping a woman happy. I'm sorry. So you got the stories conflated. Kidnapping. Because even worse, he tied a girl to a, a, a chair using an extension cord and kept her for six or seven hours in his garage. Oh yeah. Oh, he's going to jail forever. Prom. What did he do that. But that's someone's daughter wouldn't do that for a jealousy. I think it said.

Speaker 4:          01:35:53       This is apparently according to celebrity news outlet. The woman whose name I will not say apparently was backing out of a driveway in her car, hit soldiers la home when she hit the curb or at his house when she hit the curb. From that point on, his assistant reportedly became upset and started fighting with her from there. Soldier allegedly stepped outside and tried to break up the fight. The woman says that he began punching and kicking her when she was on the ground and then tied her up for six hours.

Speaker 2:          01:36:21       God, Soulja boy. Well, at least Nintendo one wish that cooler heads will prevail, but that sounds like that sounds like a fucking disaster. Jesus Christ. You never hear about the spin doctors causing any problems. Right guys? She hit a curb. This all started. She heard it. She hit a curb with his car or something. She's curb one of his wheels. Wasn't enough information on there. I don't know. Yeah, she probably curbed one of his wheels. It was a nice car and she didn't know what the fuck she was doing. I can drive what a Dick tied her up and beat her up, allegedly, allegedly. Right, right, right. You got to always say that. Denied by this. Did you see that video, that old man putting the ice on the ground and then pretending he fell. Oh, that's. Yeah. Allegedly brilliant. Allegedly, allegedly. Allegedly. There's no allegedly lead for that.

Speaker 2:          01:37:13       It's amazing. It's amazing to watch because he didn't know there was a security camera there. Tried to collect. Yeah. There's a lot of people that do that, man. I've seen videos of people doing that at the mall. They'll like throw a drink down and then slide down on the drink. We had a guy do it once at a movie theater I worked at and we had it on video also and we just showed them the video and then he left and never heard anything about it, but he was bitching up a storm like he was hurt was me. This guy, this guy's hilarious. So he's walking. He looks around chuck some ice on the ground. A little bit of a nightstand. No big deal. I'm gonna go over here and la Di da Di da. I left this fall. Watch this. He looks around and make sure no one's looking. Oh. Even felt like a bitch. It's like holding is the most ridiculous look. That silly,

Speaker 3:          01:37:56       silly, silly man. The thing about those guys is like anybody that does that kind of shit, I think the cops, all they have to do is go, sure what's your social security number? And they look up all the shit that he's also done. Like you don't that even just a little bit of a scam.

Speaker 4:          01:38:13       That's a guy who's been scam and it's like in Russia and stuff or other countries where everyone's doing the insurance scams. And so to the point where everybody has to have dash cams on their car. Now there's a lot of that just triggered a story I heard over the weekend. There was a not, it's, I think this is a story happening in Houston where the cops broke into a house where they had heard that there was or they think they had a warrant. A report was that neighbors had called and black tar heroin sales or something like that at this house. So they broke in without knocking. It was like a no knock warrant. Uh, the guys like 57 in the house, here's someone break into his house, gets a shotgun, shoots one of the cops that killed him. His wife is like, what the fuck's going on? She goes to try to grab the other cops gun that had just fallen. She gets shot, two people are dead and they didn't find any heroine. Oh Geez. There's like some weed in there or something like that. And some people are like, they didn't have a history of doing much from what I read. That's why I thought of it because they look back with these guys. Do they have an arrest history or anything? And it wasn't anything that they had found, at least what I read about it.

Speaker 3:          01:39:18       Do you remember the one where there was a mayor outside of Washington DC and he, uh, they were using his house as an address and it was something with the mail delivery guy was running weed. And so the mail delivery guy would come by and uh, the package was addressed to him, but he would just keep the package because he knew that this was this guy's house. It was on his route and that way, you know, as the package came into mail would be his to deliver, but instead of delivering it he would hold onto it. So they break into the mayor's house? No. You know the whole shoot his fucking dogs shoon his dog and he had like one of my dog like Marshall. So like a super duper sweet dog, either yellow lab, which is real similar. I think it was a yellow, might've been golden retriever.

Speaker 3:          01:40:05       Either way they fucking shot at least one of his dogs. How did they not know that was the mayor's house you think that would be like on a list day, didn't Google shit or maybe they did. Maybe they thought fucking the mayors. A drug dealer. Maybe they really thought that, but that kind of shit is dark man. We just go shoot a golden retriever. Come on, you're not a pussy and I know you're going in there because you think that this is a real drug running operation because the cops just got bad information. Right? But you're not a pussy. You don't have to shoot a fucking labrador stop. You think that things going to bite you will when it does shoot it then. So I'm going to play you the fuck out of here. That's a weird power trip. Shit thing. Shoot all dogs know if. Look, if a guy's got a wolf and it's off the chain, it's running out you. Yeah, shoot it. You break in into some guy's house and then you shoot his fucking dog. What if you're wrong? Look, you are a lot. You cool with

Speaker 2:          01:40:53       shoot and someone's fucking dog in front of their kids. That's what happened to the mayor of this town. The fucking mayor. I bet the guy was a mail carrier. Just thought it was cute to use the mayor's address. Get all the weed delivered. Maybe you didn't. Maybe voted for his opponent. He thought it was safer to do it that way. Oh, did you get a tesla? Are you just driving around? Oh, God was telling me how. How do you like it? I had to get one. I told them, you live in Moscow. I would get one guy did my podcast. I almost solid. I'm a man of my word. Uh, it's a fucking spaceship. It's the weirdest thing I've ever driven in my life. It doesn't even make sense. It's not even. Not even. There's not a single car that I've ever driven that's even close to his fast.

Speaker 2:          01:41:40       Nothing like, my porsche is so slow. I have a gt three Rs. It has 518 horsepower. Waste 3000 pounds. It sounds like a dragon. And that Tesla would leave it in the dust. I mean, leave it in the dust like zero to 62 seconds quicker. It's fucking insane and out of a no. Ludicrous. Yeah, I did. I put it in chill mode for a little while, but you could drive chill with ludicrous mode. Always available. You don't have to keep switching back. And little mode is just crazy, like the fastest and it kills your battery. Well, it kills your battery quicker, but the thrust that you get is a roller coaster ride. It's insane. I mean, you can't believe how fast it is. It doesn't even. It literally doesn't make sense. It doesn't seem right. It seems like like it's punching its way through a wormhole use an alien technology.

Speaker 2:          01:42:32       Meanwhile I posted, it seems like something Bob was our snuck out of area 51. I get all these messages from people. <Unk> has been debunked. That's controlled opposition. That's a fake story. It's fake news bro. They got you with the Bob Story. Do you like all the tech in it? That's the same one. It's too much almost because it's this giant screen. Like I had a dim it where the fuck down because I was looking at it like you're so pretty, so pretty. It's so pretty. Dream car. It's very comfortable. How long? Super comfortable. Now do you have a supercharged station at your house yet or do you thing on the wall? At my house that I can plug it into a supercharger. It takes like eight hours. Eight hours or more. And how many miles, but I'm going to get one of those. I'm going to get one of those fast charger in the house because allegedly, and I mean allegedly 311 miles.

Speaker 2:          01:43:21       Do you have the fuel? But here's the problem. I drive like a mall wrong, so it's not going that far. Did you get, is there a few option for that model and like are you cool? I think there's a fuel add on that gives you an extra like, oh, that's an option. Like I thought you meant a fuel gasoline. Yeah, I know. What are you talking to? Some models will not tesla. Okay, good. Just making shit up bro. Some, some. Uh, I think it was car. It is extra for like one gallon of gas. So like

Speaker 4:          01:43:52       if you ever lose your battery. I have heard of that. Yeah. What was that? I thought Tesla had that. No,

Speaker 3:          01:43:57       no, no, no. There was like a Prius. Prius is our mixed. They're hybrids. Prius's use gasoline, but a very stingy amount of gasoline. They run partially on electric motors. So Do, uh, the Acura NSX. The ACURA NSX has two electric motors, but I think you don't ever charge it. I think the electric motors are powered by the gasoline engine and electricity in the car, if I remember right. That's supposed to be the motherfucker like the Acura Nsx is supposed to be the car that people are underlooked under looking for whatever reason, it just doesn't get the love that it deserves. And apparently the 2019 models even more insane.

Speaker 4:          01:44:39       I can't wait to the day where like your garage floor is like a wireless charging mat. You just pull right up into the mat or they would never would be because it's rubber. Well there I'm sure they're fine because like there's a, there's, there's like if you, if you take your phone and put it on a wireless charger, there's like a little room that if you don't have to touch it, like maybe that's the whole reason why you're safe from getting hit by lightning bro. Yeah, I like that. The rubber protects you from electricity. Parco a little thing comes down to the ground. Like that thing falls out while you're driving your car over. Or did they? If the streets like if somehow like if you were riding on the highway and if you want to fuel up that you can like fuel up using the road. Like pay like a fee or something.

Speaker 3:          01:45:19       Ideally it would be great if solar panels had gotten so powerful. They can charge it just with the sun, especially because southern California is always fucking sunny except for today, but it's a matter of time. The cars of the future. That's what it is. It really is. Look, I'm a giant fan of American muscle cars there. My all time favorite cars in terms of like to drive to hear the rumble of the engine and that I love them. I love them. Maybe I'm some crazy old dude from the fucking eighties that still loves 19 sixties muscle cars. Maybe. I don't care. I love him, but that fucking cars, that future, that Tesla is the future. Like when you drive it, you realize, Oh, other cars are stupid. Is that.

Speaker 4:          01:46:01       That's that new room. New Crazy rocket today. Shooting rockets out in his backyard. Is that his house? Is there anything that you don't like on the day or something that kind of bugs you that you wish was like, oh, I don't have. There's no door handles. No,

Speaker 3:          01:46:14       no, no. Nothing. You just got to figure it out. It just takes a little while to figure out what all different buttons do and how to, how to get things to happen, but it's really well thought out. It's a look. He's a legit genius, you know, and what he's doing is unprecedented and you know, this is gonna sound like I'm kissing his ass because I liked him because he did the podcast and then I became friends with them. Know he's important. The guys got ideas that are of a magnitude that dummies, like you and me are never going to come up with any of those ideas ever. If we lived a thousand lives, we would never figure out space x.

Speaker 2:          01:46:50       it's just not in our wheelhouse. We would never make a fucking electric car. We never make one of those things. Never make a. That Tesla roadster that's going to come out. That goes zero to 60 in one point nine seconds and looks like like a spaceship, like a, like a race car spaceship from the future. We're not doing that dude. We need people like that. Those guys are super important. This guy is a. he's like a a culture changer, like a legit culture changer. He got him to smoke weed. Jesus they want to do is the ad blocker bus to want. I'm looking forward to new Toyota supra. That's the new one. Looks Dope. So this is the a space x rocket. So what does it say at the top? It says, built a stainless steel rocket ship in Texas that looks like liquid silver and might launch in February.

Speaker 2:          01:47:41       Didn't what year? What Day is this article? January 11th. A couple weeks ago. Okay. It fell over and I know that they've been doing stuff more with it, but I just how cool it looks it looks like. But I mean it did now. It fell on the ground while I was standing there. Yeah. Yeah. It got blown over the wind. It looks like a drawing for a rocket from the 19 hundreds. I don't know if he did it on purpose, but it looks just like. It looks like a fucking movie. Like buck Rogers Rogers rocket. You're right. It looks dope though. Roger's do. Driving that car really feels like like the future. And did you get the best model or is that. Of course he did. But yeah, I got the model s p 100 ds. What it's called. I just paid off my car and might just sell it and get one of those.

Speaker 2:          01:48:31       So have a place to park it that has a little charge port. Yeah, I mean I have it in a power outlet. I think you'd probably convert it. Yeah, yeah, yeah. There's a couple of superchargers in Burbank. Yeah, there's one across the street, but it's always taken. I don't know what the. You know, what's weird man passing by gas stations and going, I'm never going to use it with this. I've never pull it in there unless I want a soda. Look at that thing. That's zero to 60 in one point nine seconds. And I'm telling you, man, that's not an unrealistic number. Six hundred 20 miles. Yes. Wait, when does this come out? A couple of years. It's going to be awhile. Uh, I'm going to get at 100 percent by your old one. This is such a dope car, man. It doesn't even make sense.

Speaker 2:          01:49:12       Why has it not have a side mirror? It's got no side mirrors as cameras. Fuck the rendering of it. Probably shut your mouth. God Damn side mirror you. Sons of bitches. I, I love my camera cameras on my car. I don't even use my side mirrors. It's so much better having that look at that thing. How much is that? 600. Twenty miles. I Dunno. Probably stupid. Expensive. Look how pretty it is. It's too pretty to be cheap. Got fucking sick. That thing looks. Look at it. I mean it's like the ultimate sports car like that looks like a. That easily could be a new nine slash 11. Like from that angle particularly. And then the roof comes off. Cameras Look at those game receipts right there. Well not only that, but. Well that's what racing seats. That's why they were racing seats first and then became gamers.

Speaker 2:          01:49:57       But the steering wheel's wonky steering wheels. Like a [inaudible], like a formula one car. See it? Oh, it's like square. Yeah. Yeah. It's like you grab it by the handles. Maybe they want to make sure that you don't do this kind of shit like you. This is so fast. You probably need to hold onto it in a different way. Dude, I'm telling you that the car that I. That I got beautiful. I've never experienced anything like that before. You don't think it's real. You don't think a car can do that? Doesn't make any sense. Why do you want her $45,000? Damn. Chop back chat. Oh my gosh, that's five plus the 5,000. Fifty thousand to 50. Yeah. It's probably gonna sell out in five seconds to pay it. Every. Every dickhead in Hollywood will have one. Look at me. I'm environmentally conscious, but still success look like I'm an open shirt to do.

Speaker 2:          01:50:49       Do, do, do, do, do. I went into a volt the other day as an uber. Now is amazed by that. Pretty sweet. I think that's a hybrid right now. It's all electric. Yeah. I mean it had like five different cameras and it was pretty sweet. Did he ask him how long the range is a he? Yeah. It wasn't as good as I think of. It's like 2:30, I think he said that's not bad though. If you drive it around Hollywood, you could probably get a whole night and you know if you're ubering. Audi just announced theirs yesterday with a super bowl commercial. Oh, it looks nasty. I've seen it. It looks for honesty. Yeah, it looks nasty. Like Jesse Jackson. Nastier bad nasties. Ms Dot Jackson and it looks like A. I think it's a different one. I'm thinking of the r eight they took kit that I get the look, that stupid girl.

Speaker 2:          01:51:32       It looks like a regular Audi's what it looks like, but a Audi. Google a audi electric sportscar. There's one that doesn't look bad. It looks like a stock standard suv. That looks pretty good. Second Mile on that thing. What's the mileage? The range. The range is everything on these fucking. Exactly. Because if it's anything below like 300 miles, 100 back up comparing it, it's comparing the amount of time you charge it and what it takes to charge to get certain things. Oh, the model. The final model. Excellent. He does 144 miles and 160 miles. That ain't good. It's on that trip. On that kind of charger or something like that. Dude, don't estimate. That ain't good after 30 minutes. It's only after 30 minutes. Oh, how much you get in 30 minutes? Well that's not. That's pretty good info. So you can get 160 miles where the charge in 30 minutes.

Speaker 2:          01:52:25       That's not bad. Faster. That's a long time though. If you've got to go somewhere. If you're in a rush, you can't just pull it and get gas, but you don't want the kind of power that would it take. I mean, you imagine how many dip shit. That's it. That's the. That's the Audi. Look at that thing Brian. Oh yeah. I like that. I like that better. No, that's, that's the one. So it's basically an Audi r eight, a next generation Audi r eight. Go to the one. That's what it looks like. That's a nasty looking car. So dope electric e-tron that says that says 2016 when they announced it back at the car shows and whatnot. It's just probably what they're calling. See Google, see if it actually is a real thing or is it still just a concept because a, they always like, there's a lot of those cars.

Speaker 2:          01:53:16       They'll disappoint shit out of you. Two hundred $79. Million Miles. Oh, it's. So it's a real thing. When is it available? Wonder when that's going on. Said Twenty, 22 right there. 20, 22. Yeah. So that's probably the same time the rose just coming out. But look how they get your Dick hard years in advance. She could have ordered it in 2015. So rude though. Oh Man. So rude to get your dick hard so far in advance. Yeah. You know, like if you're like, yeah, I'm going to be fucking super environmental but I'm going to show, but it would still be stunting. Wow. Do you see the new Volkswagen Dune buggy? That looks pretty fun. No. What is that? It's a cell. A Dune buggy. It was just announced. Uh, I'm not sure if when it's for sale or if it's for sale, but it looks pretty fun. It's a, it looks like a classic Dune Buggy, but they vote Volkswagen date and it has no roof, but it was like a little fun car and on the third see a picture of that and um, yeah. All right.

Speaker 2:          01:54:18       It's a new one. Yeah. So it looks kind of cool. Right? Whoa. You could drive that on the road. Yeah. So it's a road car, but is it still a Dune buggy? Twenty to 25 again, you sons of bitches. That looks fun. Well, they were supposed to announce the new Bronco. Everybody thought it was going to happen at the Detroit auto show, but it came and went, came and went with no bronco. That makes no sense that because it's actually on their website, like they were going to announce it soon as for sale. I thought, I don't think they said that they were gonna they probably don't have it down. You know, sometimes when they're working on these experimental vehicles they uh, they'll develop something but then they don't like certain aspects of it or then maybe they are aware of a competitors work that might come out with more horsepower.

Speaker 2:          01:55:07       So they have to, like for instance, like the, um, the gt $500 from Ford, uh, it was on its way out there. There we're going to put it out the new one, but they were saying that it has over 700 horsepower. That's a. They never say that. They always give you the exact specific number. They always say 750 horsepower is coming in 20, 20 there website. Okay. But did, they didn't show it at the. Not going to make a special day for that. That might be interested in going to be nasty. Look and see what it looks like. It looks cool as fuck, right? That's right. It's the Ford website doesn't have pictures of it because they haven't released it yet. Um, but uh, what was I just saying?

Speaker 2:          01:55:52       What was I just saying? I said we're talking about what before the Bronco, the Volkswagen Beetle bug. Oh, you were saying the Bronco. I don't remember. Jamie fucked me about how that's getting pushed back because you know, somebody who might like, this car's faster. Yeah, that's right. The shelby gt 500. They said it's only so it's over 700 horsepower. The reason why they said that is because dodge came out with the demon and then they came out with some other version of the hellcat. It's also an 800 horsepower, so if you come out with only 700 horsepower, it's hard because is ridiculous as that sounds. Some people gonna think you, but it's not the Zr one that's good. Seven 50 or it's not that this or that. So they. They haven't said exactly what the horsepower rating is because they're still trying to juice it up. That might be the case of the Bronco too.

Speaker 2:          01:56:49       They might be trying to fix things and choose things, but look how good that looks. Red with the black stripes. Good Lord. Love black seat. That cars are reckless person's car. That's the difference between that and like a tesla. What's exciting about that car? The way it looks, that is a ridiculous person's car. I can drive around every day. Your fucking madman. You probably a little tipsy. Sometimes you drive, you know you might smoke cigarettes, you definitely smoke cigars, you know, you probably order shots, right? That's a ridiculous person. So Fun ass fucking car. But yeah, Quito on weekends. Look at the. The transmission. Not only is it an automatic, it's a wheel. So you spend a drive like fuck you. First of all, give me a goddamn stick shift like an American. I want to stick shift with the fucking American flag as the boot of the stick shift. It's one of the last places on the planet. We could still get a goddamn stick shifts. Sports car and what it's for. Do they release the GT 500 with an automatic. How dare you? Don't talk to me about paddles both. You can shift it manually with the paddle.

Speaker 2:          01:58:02       That's not a manual transmission, sir. That's shifting. And with the paddles. Where's my. What's my left foot doing? Should I pretend? How about give me a fake clutch. Clutch record. Pretend they looked dope though. We've got it. Good. That silver one? It looks sexy. Several with the black stripes. Goddammit. So the red one with the black stripes too. So these come out later this year at the end of the year Kinda? Yeah, I think so. Are they. I guess they haven't announced it yet so I don't think they have announced a specific data comes out, but it looks like it's got wider bodywork too, doesn't it? Like the fenders are wider and the rear and the front. But you if you want, if you don't want to wait, you can get something even more powerful. That is available right now with a manual transmission.

Speaker 3:          01:58:42       You get the shelby super snake Google that you want to see America at. It's rock hard, finest. Two thousand 19 or 18 shelby super snake, 800 motherfucking horsepower wide body Mustang with a manual transmission and they say don't even fuck with the automatic because the automatic transmission is the transmission from a regular automatic Mustang and it just doesn't know what the fuck to do. I mean it's just, it's, it's confused by this thing. The car is 800 horsepower. Turn that volume up

Speaker 7:          01:59:29       to me, that's sexy, but net worth 117 pounds

Speaker 3:          01:59:33       getting a communist mouth. That is a monster of a car. Good Lord, that's a beautiful thing

Speaker 2:          01:59:40       on your tesla. Can you download sound effects that sounds like that. You don't want that. You want to just just be cool. Just chill. Tesla's like you're, you're a man of leisure. You're a man of leisure and driving around. Comfortable and quiet is it flies around. It's like it's going through a wormhole everywhere. You drive it. Very strange car. Have you tried to self driving? Have you? Um, nerve wracking, isn't it? Having prayer. It took me on at once and it's pretty scary. Yeah. Bryan county does that thinks beaten awful lot. Was driving. Put Porn on that big screen on here. You can know. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          02:00:22       That's great. Can you imagine just driving, people are on autopilot just beaten off to porn. That giant ass screen.

Speaker 2:          02:00:28       Does it have a web browser in it seems like I haven't even looked, man. I'm sure it does something. Yeah, you could probably get online if it's parked or something ridiculous like that. It's a crazy car, but it, it, it's, it's, it seems like such a leap from anything that I've ever driven before. Like, I've never,

Speaker 3:          02:00:45       I've never experienced anything remotely close to it, so let's go fucking play some quick. So, um, I said everything I wanted to say about the, the Jack Dorsey thing, um, I've said everything I wanted to say to Alex Jones, so my olive branch extended to you, Mr Jones. I wish you well in this life. Um, and everybody else will do better. We're going to definitely have jack back on and we're going to have jack back on and review some of these cases with some of the people that are in charge with it, um, of it rather. And we're going to compile a list. We're going to try to get someone to compile a list of what they think would be contradictory cases or hypocritical cases are interesting cases or just fuel for conversation and we'll figure it out. And uh, and yeah, the cash apps. One of the sponsors of the podcast, I'm 99 point nine percent sure we said that I'm not positive we did because we talked about Justin wren fight for the forgotten charity about what that code word Rogan is doing for pygmies in the Congo.

Speaker 3:          02:01:47       When they do that, I swear to you, even though you don't have to believe me, that did not affect how I talked to that guy. I don't have a problem getting sponsors. I got plenty of sponsors. It's a good sponsor. I liked them. They do good things. They donate $5 to UFC fighter Ray Borg son's medical bills for every time someone uses the code Joe Rogan. So I like them. If I had them as a sponsor and I couldn't talk freely with him, I would be happy if they dropped me, I would be way happier for them to drop me than I would for me to say something different or not say something because they're a sponsor. Again, that sounds very self serving, like you would say that. Right? But it's true. So that's all I can tell you. All right, so that's it for today. Bye. Bye to everybody. I see ya.
