1
00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.520
<v Speaker 1>Millennials,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you grow up in a world of</v>

2
00:00:07.521 --> 00:00:09.170
<v Speaker 1>abundance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're basic needs are met,</v>

3
00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:14.060
<v Speaker 1>so like that's just an expectation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course I'm going to get a salary and</v>

4
00:00:14.061 --> 00:00:17.660
<v Speaker 1>of course I'm going to get benefits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I want is a job that has meaning to</v>

5
00:00:17.661 --> 00:00:22.661
<v Speaker 1>me that connects to my life purpose and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can only have that if you have a</v>

6
00:00:23.571 --> 00:00:26.600
<v Speaker 1>really strong culture that says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's who we are as an organization.</v>

7
00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:28.580
<v Speaker 1>Here's what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's what matters,</v>

8
00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:30.860
<v Speaker 1>here's why it matters to us to be this</v>
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

9
00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:34.110
<v Speaker 1>Organizations that are clear on that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to be more appealing to</v>

10
00:00:34.111 --> 00:00:36.230
<v Speaker 1>millennials than the organizations that</v>
<v Speaker 1>simply say,</v>

11
00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:37.393
<v Speaker 1>we do xY,</v>
<v Speaker 1>,</v>

12
00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:40.250
<v Speaker 1>z work and we have this opening position</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you should,</v>

13
00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:42.530
<v Speaker 1>you should work for us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And and that's it.</v>

14
00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:45.320
<v Speaker 1>The organizations we saw,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're doing this or designing their</v>

15
00:00:45.321 --> 00:00:47.270
<v Speaker 1>organizations around the needs of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>employees,</v>

16
00:00:47.271 --> 00:00:51.530
<v Speaker 1>not the needs of management and they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>making it work,</v>

17
00:00:51.531 --> 00:00:55.640
<v Speaker 1>experience customizable and they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>building in continuous innovation and</v>

18
00:00:55.641 --> 00:00:57.980
<v Speaker 1>improvement into management,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is new,</v>

19
00:00:57.981 --> 00:00:58.250
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

20
00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:02.180
<v Speaker 1>We used to sort of come up with our best</v>
<v Speaker 1>practice and as soon as we have that,</v>

21
00:01:02.181 --> 00:01:04.150
<v Speaker 1>we did that for the next 20 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

22
00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:06.590
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't work anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have to be more fluid.</v>

23
00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:12.010
<v Speaker 1>The traditional organization a relies</v>
<v Speaker 1>heavily on hierarchy and heavily on a</v>

24
00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:18.230
<v Speaker 1>paying your dues,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

25
00:01:18.231 --> 00:01:22.100
<v Speaker 1>So in order to advance in the company,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the standard rule is you have to come</v>

26
00:01:22.101 --> 00:01:22.881
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to work,</v>

27
00:01:22.881 --> 00:01:25.640
<v Speaker 1>you have to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to do work you don't like for a</v>

28
00:01:25.641 --> 00:01:28.640
<v Speaker 1>certain period of time so that you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>graduate to a different level where you</v>

29
00:01:28.641 --> 00:01:32.210
<v Speaker 1>get to do work that's a little bit</v>
<v Speaker 1>better and then work some more and then</v>

30
00:01:32.211 --> 00:01:35.570
<v Speaker 1>eventually start managing people and</v>
<v Speaker 1>eventually started having authority to</v>

31
00:01:35.571 --> 00:01:40.400
<v Speaker 1>make decisions or do things on your own.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That organization just doesn't make</v>

32
00:01:40.401 --> 00:01:42.200
<v Speaker 1>sense to millennials.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

33
00:01:42.201 --> 00:01:46.070
<v Speaker 1>we interviewed millennials for this book</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the general theme from our response</v>

34
00:01:46.071 --> 00:01:48.950
<v Speaker 1>from the millennials was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why are you guys running it like this?</v>

35
00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:51.500
<v Speaker 1>Like they're literally scratching their</v>
<v Speaker 1>heads saying,</v>

36
00:01:51.501 --> 00:01:53.630
<v Speaker 1>why would you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why would you run an organization like</v>

37
00:01:53.631 --> 00:01:56.420
<v Speaker 1>this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why would you not empower people who are</v>

38
00:01:56.421 --> 00:01:58.190
<v Speaker 1>closest to the customer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for instance,</v>

39
00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:00.320
<v Speaker 1>to make a decision?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why would you,</v>

40
00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:04.900
<v Speaker 1>why would you not share information like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a huge women organizations and</v>

41
00:02:04.901 --> 00:02:09.140
<v Speaker 1>millennials don't get to some extent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the earlier generations are going to</v>

42
00:02:09.141 --> 00:02:11.780
<v Speaker 1>have to learn to give up control.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

43
00:02:11.781 --> 00:02:13.970
<v Speaker 1>that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a big theme I'm seeing in</v>

44
00:02:13.971 --> 00:02:15.240
<v Speaker 1>organizations that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

45
00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:18.260
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of our management systems are based</v>

46
00:02:18.261 --> 00:02:22.730
<v Speaker 1>on control being a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm finding organizations that give</v>

47
00:02:22.731 --> 00:02:24.650
<v Speaker 1>up on that actually you get to achieve</v>
<v Speaker 1>more.</v>

48
00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:29.090
<v Speaker 1>And so I think the smart organizations</v>
<v Speaker 1>are going to get clear looking at their</v>

49
00:02:29.091 --> 00:02:31.850
<v Speaker 1>millennial workforce,</v>
<v Speaker 1>much of much of whom are going to be</v>

50
00:02:31.851 --> 00:02:35.240
<v Speaker 1>entry level to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know you're entry level,</v>

51
00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:37.730
<v Speaker 1>but in this area I'm going to let you</v>
<v Speaker 1>run with it.</v>

52
00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:41.090
<v Speaker 1>Like within these walls,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can do whatever you want,</v>

53
00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.070
<v Speaker 1>you can experiment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can be in charge.</v>

54
00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:45.530
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so you've just got to be clear about</v>

55
00:02:45.531 --> 00:02:49.190
<v Speaker 1>where those walls are so that they don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>have huge impacts on the rest of the</v>

56
00:02:49.191 --> 00:02:50.720
<v Speaker 1>enterprise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

57
00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:54.140
<v Speaker 1>but find places early on to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they have the experience of making</v>

58
00:02:54.141 --> 00:02:57.080
<v Speaker 1>their own decisions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I also think in general,</v>

59
00:02:57.081 --> 00:02:59.870
<v Speaker 1>organizations will be pleasantly</v>
<v Speaker 1>surprised when they start letting their</v>

60
00:02:59.871 --> 00:03:03.110
<v Speaker 1>employees experiment because I think</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll start seeing results that they</v>

61
00:03:03.111 --> 00:03:04.460
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't have predicted that they</v>
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't get.</v>
