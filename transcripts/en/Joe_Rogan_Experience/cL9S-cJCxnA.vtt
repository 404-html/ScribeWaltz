1
00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:06.400
<v Speaker 1>You asked me if I knew the person's</v>
<v Speaker 1>looking for truth.</v>

2
00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:07.610
<v Speaker 1>You see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a scientist,</v>

3
00:00:07.611 --> 00:00:11.940
<v Speaker 1>we're even today like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Earlier I talked about the fact that all</v>

4
00:00:11.941 --> 00:00:15.840
<v Speaker 1>we can do in science is construct</v>
<v Speaker 1>theories and that means,</v>

5
00:00:15.841 --> 00:00:18.870
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that what we're ultimately doing is not</v>

6
00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.400
<v Speaker 1>about the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a confusion I think that exists</v>

7
00:00:21.401 --> 00:00:25.260
<v Speaker 1>in many people's minds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Science is not about finding the truth.</v>

8
00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.040
<v Speaker 1>What scientists about is making our</v>
<v Speaker 1>beliefs of nature less false.</v>

9
00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.460
<v Speaker 1>These are two different things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the second one involves mathematics,</v>

10
00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:38.820
<v Speaker 1>imagination,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the ability to measure.</v>

11
00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.500
<v Speaker 1>So we're making our beliefs less false.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're not necessarily finding it through</v>

12
00:00:43.501 --> 00:00:45.030
<v Speaker 1>the fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure.</v>

13
00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.140
<v Speaker 1>Truth actually exists in science and</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is in fact a very famous statement</v>

14
00:00:49.141 --> 00:00:53.520
<v Speaker 1>that Einstein made that he is not sure</v>
<v Speaker 1>what truth means in the context of</v>

15
00:00:53.521 --> 00:00:54.990
<v Speaker 1>science.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So No,</v>

16
00:00:54.991 --> 00:00:56.190
<v Speaker 1>I'm not searching for truth.</v>

17
00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:01.190
<v Speaker 1>That's certainly not what I'm doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes when I look at my own career,</v>

18
00:01:01.711 --> 00:01:06.120
<v Speaker 1>I feel a little bit like Captain Ahab</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think probably a lot of us feel</v>

19
00:01:06.121 --> 00:01:08.520
<v Speaker 1>that way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that this is a great white whale that we</v>

20
00:01:08.521 --> 00:01:12.270
<v Speaker 1>saw once and we're trying to capture it</v>
<v Speaker 1>in my own life.</v>

21
00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:14.400
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I earlier spoke of this</v>

22
00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.510
<v Speaker 1>interdisciplinary collaboration of</v>
<v Speaker 1>mathematicians and physicists and</v>

23
00:01:18.511 --> 00:01:20.760
<v Speaker 1>computer scientists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're,</v>

24
00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:22.570
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

25
00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:27.570
<v Speaker 1>on the p Quad chasing my white whale.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's this one problem that I know</v>

26
00:01:27.571 --> 00:01:30.000
<v Speaker 1>about that I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been able to develop some</v>

27
00:01:30.001 --> 00:01:35.001
<v Speaker 1>particular insights into.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this collaboration is actually</v>

28
00:01:35.131 --> 00:01:38.640
<v Speaker 1>pursuing this problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've been able to turn sets of</v>

29
00:01:38.641 --> 00:01:43.260
<v Speaker 1>equations that the sorts of pictures and</v>
<v Speaker 1>these pictures can be processed.</v>

30
00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:48.030
<v Speaker 1>And by manipulating the pictures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're massively using them to</v>

31
00:01:48.031 --> 00:01:52.650
<v Speaker 1>understand properties are the equations</v>
<v Speaker 1>I call these pictures of Dinka and</v>

32
00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:53.760
<v Speaker 1>thinkers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A very interesting word.</v>

33
00:01:53.761 --> 00:01:57.210
<v Speaker 1>It comes from west Africa and it</v>
<v Speaker 1>basically means pictures that have</v>

34
00:01:57.211 --> 00:01:59.550
<v Speaker 1>hidden meaning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's what we've applied to</v>

35
00:01:59.551 --> 00:02:02.100
<v Speaker 1>these mathematical objects.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so yes,</v>

36
00:02:02.101 --> 00:02:04.440
<v Speaker 1>I have my own personal moby Dick that</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm after.</v>

37
00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.430
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't plan to suffer the fate of the</v>

38
00:02:07.431 --> 00:02:08.850
<v Speaker 1>peak wise and it's capital.</v>

39
00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:16.760
<v Speaker 1>No</v>
<v Speaker 1>theoretical.</v>

40
00:02:16.761 --> 00:02:20.770
<v Speaker 1>Physics doesn't really make that kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>company contribution to our</v>

41
00:02:20.771 --> 00:02:22.630
<v Speaker 1>understanding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

42
00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:28.650
<v Speaker 1>one of the another thing I tell people</v>
<v Speaker 1>about what science is versus other forms</v>

43
00:02:29.441 --> 00:02:34.441
<v Speaker 1>of knowing the universe in science and</v>
<v Speaker 1>in particular in the physical sciences,</v>

44
00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:40.690
<v Speaker 1>you can imagine a family that lives in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>home and you could say,</v>

45
00:02:40.691 --> 00:02:42.190
<v Speaker 1>well Gee,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to study this situation,</v>

46
00:02:42.191 --> 00:02:44.710
<v Speaker 1>but I want to put all the people out of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the house.</v>

47
00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:49.120
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to study how the house works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what the physical sciences do in</v>

48
00:02:49.121 --> 00:02:51.950
<v Speaker 1>our universe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The social sciences,</v>

49
00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:54.550
<v Speaker 1>the liberal arts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the arts themselves.</v>

50
00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:58.660
<v Speaker 1>You'll put the people back in the house</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you asked how the whole system works</v>

51
00:02:58.661 --> 00:03:00.400
<v Speaker 1>together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in physics,</v>

52
00:03:00.401 --> 00:03:04.440
<v Speaker 1>we don't answer the question of how the</v>
<v Speaker 1>house behaves when the families in the</v>

53
00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:08.400
<v Speaker 1>past.</v>
