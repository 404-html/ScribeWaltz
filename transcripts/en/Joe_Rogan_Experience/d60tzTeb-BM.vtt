1
00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.790
<v Speaker 1>I think we're in a kind of period of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2
00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.050
<v Speaker 1>late modernism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>renewed modernism in which,</v>

3
00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.960
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the modern style,</v>

4
00:00:15.961 --> 00:00:20.961
<v Speaker 1>which was mistakenly given up for dead</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the 80s with postmodernism,</v>

5
00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:25.830
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has kind of come back reinventing itself</v>

6
00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.160
<v Speaker 1>much more urbane correcting some of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>mistakes of modernism first time around</v>

7
00:00:32.131 --> 00:00:34.380
<v Speaker 1>when it was so anti urban,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

8
00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:40.010
<v Speaker 1>and with much more either restraint in</v>
<v Speaker 1>some cases and clarity and almost</v>

9
00:00:42.661 --> 00:00:46.080
<v Speaker 1>sometimes minimalism and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

10
00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:51.110
<v Speaker 1>or a kind of more expressionistic strain</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that we see different strains.</v>

11
00:00:52.111 --> 00:00:56.850
<v Speaker 1>And I do not think that this is a time</v>
<v Speaker 1>that can be summarized in any single ism</v>

12
00:00:56.851 --> 00:00:58.020
<v Speaker 1>anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

13
00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:00.000
<v Speaker 1>there's too many different things going</v>
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>

14
00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:01.650
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

15
00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:06.030
<v Speaker 1>probably the one that is kind of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>most,</v>

16
00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:09.600
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unifying or compelling of the time to</v>

17
00:01:09.601 --> 00:01:14.601
<v Speaker 1>the extent that anything can pull a</v>
<v Speaker 1>diverse time together would be this sort</v>

18
00:01:15.211 --> 00:01:18.330
<v Speaker 1>of late,</v>
<v Speaker 1>modernist moment that we're in where</v>

19
00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.250
<v Speaker 1>really good architects are reinventing</v>
<v Speaker 1>the modernist vocabulary</v>

20
00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.230
<v Speaker 1>where we're at right now.</v>

21
00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:31.200
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to ever encapsulate that with</v>

22
00:01:31.201 --> 00:01:32.100
<v Speaker 1>a single building.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

23
00:01:32.101 --> 00:01:33.480
<v Speaker 1>there was a time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

24
00:01:33.481 --> 00:01:37.530
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't years ago when frank,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gary's Guggenheim museum in Bilbao seem</v>

25
00:01:37.531 --> 00:01:39.900
<v Speaker 1>to sort of sum up everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it did and it,</v>

26
00:01:39.901 --> 00:01:40.310
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

27
00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:45.120
<v Speaker 1>it was really the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the symbolic beginning of a whole age of</v>

28
00:01:45.121 --> 00:01:49.620
<v Speaker 1>architecture and they age of intense</v>
<v Speaker 1>engagement with architecture and with</v>

29
00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:53.790
<v Speaker 1>doing buildings in some cases were</v>
<v Speaker 1>really quite wonderful and brilliant</v>

30
00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:54.660
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

31
00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.910
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>profound even,</v>

32
00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:58.590
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>other cases,</v>

33
00:01:58.591 --> 00:02:00.120
<v Speaker 1>buildings that would just sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>excessive.</v>

34
00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.750
<v Speaker 1>Right now we've kind of pulled back from</v>
<v Speaker 1>that a lot,</v>

35
00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.670
<v Speaker 1>but we're not entirely sure where we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>going.</v>

36
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.820
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a tremendous interest in</v>

37
00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:13.260
<v Speaker 1>sustainability today and in</v>
<v Speaker 1>environmentalism and buildings being</v>

38
00:02:13.261 --> 00:02:15.940
<v Speaker 1>responsible from a green standpoint,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

39
00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:19.170
<v Speaker 1>which is all to the good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a greater sense,</v>

40
00:02:19.171 --> 00:02:22.530
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the building as part of a larger,</v>

41
00:02:22.531 --> 00:02:27.030
<v Speaker 1>whole and less as an individual</v>
<v Speaker 1>standalone monument.</v>

42
00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:31.140
<v Speaker 1>So we're more concerned with urbanism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how buildings relate to each other on</v>

43
00:02:31.141 --> 00:02:33.990
<v Speaker 1>the street and as part of a community,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're more concerned,</v>

44
00:02:33.991 --> 00:02:35.970
<v Speaker 1>I think with planning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to hope.</v>

45
00:02:35.971 --> 00:02:37.320
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

46
00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:41.550
<v Speaker 1>we're not believing that you can keep</v>
<v Speaker 1>growing and spreading out forever and</v>

47
00:02:41.551 --> 00:02:43.320
<v Speaker 1>ever across the landscape that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

48
00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:46.740
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've got to make our cities denser and</v>

49
00:02:46.741 --> 00:02:49.350
<v Speaker 1>tighter in part to preserve the land.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

50
00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:54.360
<v Speaker 1>I sense a lot of that right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Much more willingness to begin to</v>

51
00:02:54.361 --> 00:02:59.361
<v Speaker 1>consider alternate forms of housing as</v>
<v Speaker 1>reflections of alternate forms of living</v>

52
00:03:02.321 --> 00:03:04.750
<v Speaker 1>and alternative family structures and</v>
<v Speaker 1>things like that.</v>

53
00:03:04.751 --> 00:03:05.800
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

54
00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:10.830
<v Speaker 1>for a long time we've just assumed that</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody would fit into the same little</v>

55
00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:16.510
<v Speaker 1>pigeonholed box,</v>
<v Speaker 1>either a little suburban house or an</v>

56
00:03:16.511 --> 00:03:20.260
<v Speaker 1>apartment in the city or whatever that</v>
<v Speaker 1>was designed for a very traditional</v>

57
00:03:20.261 --> 00:03:22.120
<v Speaker 1>nuclear family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

58
00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:25.840
<v Speaker 1>family structures are different now and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're changing and they're more</v>

59
00:03:25.841 --> 00:03:28.210
<v Speaker 1>options.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so why aren't there more housing</v>

60
00:03:28.211 --> 00:03:30.340
<v Speaker 1>options at the same time to reflect</v>
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>

61
00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:33.610
<v Speaker 1>You hear more people at least talking</v>
<v Speaker 1>about that now.</v>

62
00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:38.260
<v Speaker 1>And I think if we were not in this</v>
<v Speaker 1>difficult recession where it's tough to</v>

63
00:03:38.261 --> 00:03:41.290
<v Speaker 1>build anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'd actually see more real stuff</v>

64
00:03:41.291 --> 00:03:43.570
<v Speaker 1>happening right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But with luck,</v>

65
00:03:43.571 --> 00:03:48.571
<v Speaker 1>we can use this time to plan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to sort of develop ideas and be ready to</v>

66
00:03:48.581 --> 00:03:51.160
<v Speaker 1>do more interesting stuff when the time</v>
<v Speaker 1>comes.</v>

67
00:03:51.161 --> 00:03:52.180
<v Speaker 1>Hopefully pretty soon.</v>
