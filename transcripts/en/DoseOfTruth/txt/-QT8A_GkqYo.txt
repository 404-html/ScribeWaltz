Speaker 1:          00:00          No, that the snake is utilize conceptually and metaphorically as representation of transformation, right? Because the snake is something that can shed its skin and be reborn. We know that a snake is something that's innately attractive and terrifying human beings and other primates, so that if you come across a snake, you're likely to be at least startled, if not horrified by it, but also attracted to it in a way that is underneath your voluntary consciousness, right? Because snakes attract orienting reflex isn't they activate the systems underneath your consciousness that actually govern the structure of that consciousness. We know that the snake can be well represented as well as internal chaos. So imagine this, imagine that it's not unreasonable for a self conscious mind searching for a mode of self representation to remark on the parallels between the structure of the snake and the spine and the brain. Given that a snake is essentially a spine with a brain. And then imagine as well that the most archaic aspects of our nervous system, those that govern novelty and orienting and anxiety responses are in fact precisely those that were described by Mclean as nested inside the reptilian brain. And then imagine along with the Hindu Yoga, is that the purpose of Kundalini Yoga is to activate the circuitry that's associated with that snake, so to speak, to produce a permanent state of alert wakefulness. It's associated with consciousness.

Speaker 2:          01:34          Ooh,

Speaker 1:          01:36          so imagine this, imagine an animal like like a zebra grazing mindlessly in the herd with no consciousness whatsoever. And then imagine it's relatively undeveloped cortical structures activated suddenly by the movement of a lion off in the perimeter. And then imagine for that brief moment that thawed zebra is actually conscious, a state that requires a tremendous amount of energy on difficult to maintain, but because the threat and the uncertainty manifest itself within the zebras mode of consciousness, it wakes momentarily. And then imagine that human beings are like that. Zebra always because we've become self conscious because we know that the unknown is around us all the time. Even when we think we're safe, we're never safe. Imagine that. The reason we're so conscious is because as a consequence of our discovery of the possibility of our own mortality, all of this underlying circuitry that in other animals is only apparent when they're startled or afraid or interested or curious.

Speaker 1:          02:40          In human beings. It's on all the time. And that's what makes us conscious. And the reason for that is because we developed enough cortical elaboration to note that we're always threatened by everything that's around us. And then imagine that, well, that's pretty awful, isn't it? Because it's at the basis of all our innate existential, but then imagine as well that without that terror pushing us forward and and our constant reference to the dangerous aspect of the unknown, we would have never been motivated to produce the kind of societies that we've produced, which are essentially very remarkably elaborated devices that enable us to find some protection from that unknown and to manipulate, manipulate it effectively. And then remembering that story we will return to genesis young says the snake, his was regarded by early gnostic Christians as a kind of daddy who's faculties were more developed and advanced than the original daddy that actually structured the world.

Speaker 1:          03:43          The idea there being that the world initially was a pretty dismal place. Everyone wasn't conscious. We all existed at the level of the animal and then the snake came along and said, wake up, wake up. And the movement from that state of unself consciousness paradise to this profane state of awakening can be regarded not so much as a descent, but as an asset of sorts, even though a painful one. And then you have your, at this commentary from Mephistopheles, his representation of Satan and his capacity for temptation, who says, follow the adage of my cousin's snake from dreams of God. Like knowledge. You will wake to fear in which your very soul shell quake a statement associating the human tendency to attribute to all revolutionary sources of new information, uh, kind of demonic being. And then you have the problem of the woman. Now we know that within the context of the Judeo Christian tradition, women have unduly suffered for their role and tempting humanity in the embodied form of Adam towards higher order self consciousness.

Speaker 1:          05:02          And then you think, well, let's just take a look at how human beings and their mating relationships differ from those of other animals like chimpanzees to whom we are very closely, genetically related. And if you look at the mating strategies of female chimpanzees, you see that they really don't care who they sleep with, so to speak. Any old chimpanzee will do. Now the last dominant male chimps tend to be chased away by the more dominant male chimps. But if a female and less dominant chimp can get the hell away from the watchful gaze of the dominance hierarchy, they're perfectly happy to mate. Human females are not like that. There is selective matters, and there's a tremendous body of evolutionary psychological information that suggests that although both genders value intelligence and physical appearance, females value the ability to attain dominance, hierarchy status in men far than men, admire the ability to attain dominant status in women, which is to say that men don't care what a woman has with regards to potential for attaining status.

Speaker 1:          06:08          Whereas with women, it's one of the strong determinants of mating preference. So Len, let's say, look, we don't know why the hell our cortex is expanded so rapidly, somewhere between five and 3 million years ago. Let's offer this as a hypothesis. The women started to get choosy, and because they were so damn complicated, the whole human species had to exaggerate it's cortical growth prior to any even use for that cortical growth, just so that the men had an even hand in the competition, right? So women put tremendous selection pressure on the human being to develop tremendous, tremendous cortical expansion. Now, we already know that from a mythological perspective, that women are frequently casting to the same conceptual domain, the temptress domain as the benevolent aspect of the unknown. And we know as well from representations of hero mythology that it is the individual who goes out to confront chaos, who's most likely to free from the Dragon, not only treasured, but a virgin, say in the case of mythological representations like Saint George and the Dragon.
