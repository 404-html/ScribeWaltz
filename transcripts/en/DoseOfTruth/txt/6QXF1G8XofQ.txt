Speaker 1:          00:00          Dr peterson was the party. Thank you both for being here today. Um, when political scientists have studied is to solitary and regimes. I'm sorry, I'm going to move this a little bit. Just feel weird. Totalitarian regimes. I've studied. I tried to look at the Iranian revolution and the Islamic Republic of Iran and I've argued how the Shia Islam that is teached in the Islamic republic is very close to a totalitarian regime, but now I live in a country where my ideas are considered controversial. If you believe in God, if you believe in family, if you believe in having responsibility and traditional values, I feel ostracized by the community here. I came from UC University of Calgary over there. I didn't feel this way. There was more welcoming. Here I feel marginalized and I do feel alone and when I see this, it disgusts me that here they can do this, but I couldn't go to their events, do anything.

Speaker 1:          00:48          I'd have to shut up the disciplinary committee for me, but for them they can break windows to God knows how old this building is and it's okay for them to do that. So my question to you is now being here, experiencing this, I'm starting to second guess that maybe the totalitarian Islamic regime that I was so, you know, talking about and critical of back in Iran isn't so bad when I have a choice between having to be here and be oppressed and be there and at least have my ideas be okay with the regime. So my argument is if this free speech and the arguments you guys are making here, it doesn't work, would that not be the next step for people to go towards totalitarianism? If dialogue fails, then isn't force of arms the only thing left? How can people compromise when they don't want to talk, when they want to yell? Thank you.

Speaker 2:          01:35          Thank you.

Speaker 3:          01:42          I think you make a very good point. I don't think we should fool ourselves. This is about force and it is a. it's almost a dare to suggest that that certain elements are not allowed to enforce their view of the world and that speaking contrary to it, isn't that a front to those values and they won't shut you down. I mean that, that, that is what is at stake. We, we are, we are, we are no longer really in a situation where this will all be resolved through sort of gentle, reasonable civil dialogue that, that happens on the side, but it's not real anymore. It's not really where the fight is happening. This is a, an imposition of the force of the state and it is skewed, it is skewed a certain way and we are getting to the point where a certain kind of language or certain kinds of dialogue is, is approved and all right and a certain kind is not. And that is the campaign that is going on to, this is all part of. And I have to say that, that your presence here and your endorsement of this kind of event is the kind of thing that has the major pushback to trend, but the trend

Speaker 4:          03:00          is continuing and is a very dangerous one. And uh, this is, uh, a difficult moment in the life of this country. Would you, would you say Jordan? So, so some, some comments about, about your career. Let's say. Okay, so you're a young mountain. And you've got lots of years ahead of you, so you know, you want to prepare for the war, not the battle, right, okay. Because there's going to be many battles for you personally and perhaps politically and all of that. And so you want to make yourself as articulate and educated as you can and you want to have patients. I would say that there is no cause for despair, you know, I believe that the, the, the people who are attempting to radicalize our society and to transform it into a battleground of identity politics are in the distinct minority. And I think that I think that there is no reason to assume that we can't push the devil back into the, into the bottle, so to speak, to push the genie back into the bottle.

Speaker 4:          03:56          And so don't despair. Now from a personal perspective, it's like we've got lots of things to learn and you've got lots of things to say and to write and you're going to find now and then that you were imposed upon in a manner that you don't find tolerable, right? You think, I can't live like this, right? It's going to distress you in, well then, then you've come across your moral conundrum, right? It's specific to you and then you have to. That's when you have to grow up and think strategically. It's like you decide, are you willing to live under those conditions? If you're not, then you develop a strategy. It's like, okay, I'm going to. I'm going to fight this. I'm going to fight it carefully, intelligently, thoughtfully on multiple fronts and I'm not going to back down and you don't make that decision lightly.

Speaker 4:          04:47          You know most things you should let blow by you because there's not that much of you and there's lots of things, but now and then you'll find a stumbling block that you can't get over it because it hurts you. It damages your soul. That's the right way to think about it. Well then that's the time for you to put your education to use. No, and you'll be able to do that. I mean, you don't want to underestimate the utility of of deep, forthright speech. I don't believe that anything can stand in its way. It have the courage of your convictions, but don't give way to despair like this battle is by no means over. No, I know meets and it isn't even obvious that the bad guys are winning, so to speak. You know? I mean here we are, we're having this talk. The university came out forthrightly in favor of free speech for.

Speaker 2:          05:38          Thank you.

Speaker 4:          05:51          No one so far. All the questions today have been thoughtful and intelligent. You seem like informed so like don't underestimate your strength. And so, and mcmaster just published a set of guidelines governing this sort of behavior so that it will no longer be acceptable to disrupt perfectly reasonable proceedings on university campuses in the. And so the, so the discussions like this can continue properly. I mean there's definitely a place for a give and take and for informed opposition let's say, but there's a difference between informed opposition in child childish grandstanding. And I think people know the difference between that. So don't, don't be desperate about it. Pick your battles. A little courage goes a long way, right? Because other people see it and

Speaker 3:          06:43          there's a. There is I think a silent majority out there that is silence and is scared, but if they see courage from somebody, they responded to it. Well, I think you described lawyers in a way that appealed to me once. He said, I think I know that's rare, but you said lawyers. I think these are the words you said lawyers are difficult and emotionally stable and is the combination of those two things. The willingness to be difficult but not to be emotional about it. Don't, don't, don't wear your emotions to the fight. Take a step back, engage in it. Say what you think. Be Courageous, but don't get wrapped up in it. Don't be emotional about it, but you know, retain your strength for the long haul.

Speaker 4:          07:36          Well, you know, one of the things I've learned strategically, and this is really worth thinking about too, is that when you're engaged in a public dispute like this, it's not obvious when things are going your way. You know, you think, well, this protest is not such a good thing. It's like, I wouldn't be so sure about that. You know, what's happened to me in the last 18 months is that virtually every time that I've been attacked and some of the attacks have been quite well, I wouldn't say brutal because we haven't got to that thank God, but they've certainly been, um, they've taken me aback. You know, it's not, it's not a straightforward thing to be in a hall with this happened at mcmaster with 100 people yelling at you and blaring air horns and all of that. But that wasn't a bad thing as it turned out because it was filmed and it was put on Youtube and it was terrible for the people who protested, you know, it wasn't good.

Speaker 4:          08:34          And so you got to detach yourself to, you know, if, if you say what you think and you're careful about it, it's going to have some short term effects and it's gonna have some medium term effects and it's going to have some longterm effects. And one of the things that you need to do, I would say, and this is an element of courage, is you have to have faith that the medium to longterm consequences of you saying you have to say as clearly as possible, it's going to be positive and you have to act on that supposition. You don't know, right? You can't know that that's the existential leap of faith is you can't know, but you act anyway. And my experience has been that you don't wanna. You don't want to make judgment too quickly because it's not always clear when things are going your way. So when you know you might stand up in a class and say something that people react negatively to eat and you might get pilloried for that by some people, but you never know who you're touching in the crowd and you don't know how that's going to unfold across time. And then you have that might be a defining moment in someone else's life to watch you stand up and say what you have to say. So don't underestimate the power of truth and courage really. So

Speaker 2:          09:46          thank you.
