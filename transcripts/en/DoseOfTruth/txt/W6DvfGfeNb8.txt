Speaker 1:          00:07          Idea of individual responsibility through through 12 rules, while we might say we might begin by thinking about how that's related to the idea of free speech. It's like you have to find your way in the world, let's say with all of your peculiarities, your idiosyncrasies and your differences and the way you do that is by acting in the world, but the way you prepare to act is by thinking and really what you're doing when you're thinking. There's a philosopher named Alfred North Whitehead who said something very intelligent about thinking. He said that the reason we think is so that our thoughts can die instead of us. Right? And it's a Darwinian idea. So the way animals adapt to the world across time is that animals produced variance very into offspring. Many of them, and most of them were unsuccessful and die, but a few of them are successful enough in that time and place to reproduce.

Speaker 1:          01:10          And so the animal keeps living across the millennia varying slightly as it does. So to adapt to the transformations of the environment. Human beings do the same thing, but we also have figured out how to abstract that and so what we do when we think is that we produce a fictional world that's a simulation of the real world and we populate that simulated world with simulations of us and then we let those simulations play out in the simulated world and the ones that are successful, we embody and act out and the ones that are unsuccessful. We abandoned and let die and we do that. When we're thinking in dreams and we do that when we think in stories and we even do that when we think in words. Although it's not as obvious when you argue internally, which is what you do when you think you have an Avatar that manifests itself as one point of view and an Avatar that manifests itself as another and you let them engage in conflict and the one that loses you let go off.

Speaker 1:          02:11          That's a sacrifice and if you're discussing something with someone and it's important that you both put your viewpoints forward and you analyze the consequences of the dispute and then you walk away with any luck, why is there then you were so that you can embody a motive being that's more likely to be successful and you do that in part in large part by exercising your freedom of speech and you might think, well, why? Freedom of speech and freedom of thought, and the answer to that is don't be thinking that you think because thinking is very hard and most people can't think at all and even if you can think you're not very good at it. I mean think about what you have to do technically to think. First of all, you have to formulate the problem that's hard enough and you have to formulate it precisely.

Speaker 1:          02:58          Then have to generate multiple potential solutions to the problem and then you have to let those solutions argue themselves into a hierarchy internally and so you have to be able to tolerate that stress, right? You can't just be one thing if you're going to think because thinking isn't just saying that. What I think is right, that's not thinking at all. Thinking is questioning whether or not what you think is right is right and that's really hard. It's very demanding and so and you can do that to some degree, but you're not as good at it as you think. Even if you're a pretty good thinker. Mostly the way you think is by talking and you talk and mostly when you talk and think it's contentious as you know if you've ever had an intimate relationship with someone because an intimate relationship, if it, if it has any worth at all, is a place where there's tremendous contention but it's bounded within something approximating mutual respect and the willingness to continue to play the game across time and the reason that an intimate relationship is contentious because life is very, very difficult and people are different and we face extraordinarily complex problems together.

Speaker 1:          04:07          Like how to make a living and how to. How to operate properly in our careers and how to rank order the importance of our careers and how to manage our domestic economies and how to discipline our kids and whether or not to have kids and how to enter middle age and how to grow old gracefully and how to live productively and where to vacation and all of these things which are extraordinarily difficult problems and the only way that we can solve them is by butting heads to some degree and communicating freely about what the possibilities are and negotiating a solution and that's thinking and in order to do that thinking, you have to be able to speak freely and you certainly have to be willing to offend someone. I mean, of all the stupid questions I've ever been asked by journalists, the question, what makes you think you have the right to offend someone by what you say is by far the most miraculously ignorant and I say that because,

Speaker 2:          05:03          well,

Speaker 1:          05:07          no, it just. It just sets me back on my heels to some degree because I think, well, what's your claim here? Your claim is. Your first claim is we could hypothetically discussed something important without one of us getting upset. It's like, that's not gonna happen. If you ever discuss anything important with anyone, including just discussing it with yourself, not only are you going to get upset, you're going to get so upset that you probably won't even do it. You know, you think, well, I have a difficult problem. What do you. What's your first reaction? Well, I'm going to sit right here and think about that. It's like, no, that isn't your reaction. Your reaction is to go like play a video game or watch a youtube video or or vacuum your bedroom or do the dishes or whatever can do not to think about that.

Speaker 1:          05:58          That's what you're going to do. So you know, and then if you're going to have a discussion with your wife or your husband or your kids and it's about something important. It's like if you're a normal person, your heart rate goes up and it's like it's demanding and then you have to think it through and then you're probably wrong and you're going to stumble over your words and God only knows if you're going to reach a solution and you can't tell if it's going to mean the end of your damn relationship and like the catastrophe lurks everywhere when you're discussing difficult issues and the rule is something like, but you can't offend anyone. It's like, well then okay, fine. Then you never get to talk about anything that's important with anyone ever including yourself. So like that's supposed to be the rule. Then you think, well even if it's not quite that bad, it's like let's say, so here I'm addressing about 850 people, something like that.

Speaker 1:          06:46          It's like, what's the probability that I could talk about anything that any of you would ever want to listen to for more than about 15 seconds, you know, that would grip your interest without me or offending at least one person in this room with each sentence. There's a thousand people in here, you know, and some people are unbelievably easy to offend. There's that. They're just looking for a reason to be offended, so, so there's that problem. But if we're going to deal with things that are, that are solid and contentious and why, talk about things that we already all agree on. We've already solved those problems. We can only really talk about things we don't agree on. It's the only thing worth talking about. Well, of course everyone's going to be offended. And so for a journalist to ask that, it's like, what the Hell's with you? What? What planet do you inhabit? Don't you understand that your entire discipline is predicated on not only your right to offend someone, but the responsibility that you have to offend people. It's like that's it's

Speaker 1:          08:06          cool thinking isn't offensive act, which is why tyrants hated, right? Because one of the rules and tyranny is don't think why? Because I already know all the answers and you're supposed to accept my answers as the tyrant and so there's no need for your thinking. And you might be saying, well, my life isn't going as well as it could, and the tyrant says, well, you don't get to think that because in my utopian tyranny, everything's perfect. And if you're suffering, that means you're politically suspect because you're suffering. Your inability to recognize that the utopia has already manifested itself. Your unhappiness is actually a political crime, but if you just keep it to yourself, well we'll let you keep your head, but you have the the. If you're driven to the extreme where you have to express the fact that you're unhappy, perhaps that your child doesn't have enough to eat, then it's off to the Gulag with you and all your family as well because there'll be no thinking here and even if there is, they'll certainly be no talking.

Speaker 1:          09:16          Here's something that happened recently in Venezuela, Mrs. Worth Thinking about for all the people who harbor collectivist Utopian Dreams, Venezuela, the Venezuelan government about two months ago, this was reported in the New York Times, which is not a newspaper. I would say that would be intrinsically biased against Venezuela. Said that it was now illegal to diagnose the cause of a child's death in a Venezuelan hospital as starvation because the Venezuelans, Venezuelan government's answer to the problem of children starving was to make it illegal to notice it in hospitals. And that's a tyranny, right? That's a place where thought is not allowed. That's a place where free speech is not allowed. So it seems to me that that's not a good place to go to say the least. And we've gone there many times in the last one, hundred and 50 years and we should perhaps think very hard about whether or not we ever want to go there again.
