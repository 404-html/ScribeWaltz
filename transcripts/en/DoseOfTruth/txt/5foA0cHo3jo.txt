Speaker 1:          00:00          You also felt that sort of embedded inside the shower where the contract sexual tendencies and so for example, sometimes you see people who are well developed. Men let say, and we can. We can also talk about women in this regard. Men who've integrated their shadow often also develop a kind of peculiar grace that would be a consequence of not only allowing their aggressive side to step forward, but also their, their feminine and in Compassionate side that might, that they may have kept squelched because of embarrassment about it or because they'd been harassed for being weak or any number of things. So, but the practical approach for developing your shadow, I would say is to contemplate and consider your resentment and notice what it says and because your resentment will also tell you what you have to say. You know, so look, look at what happened at Google this weekend.

Speaker 1:          00:48          You know, James Damore wrote that memo and you can imagine he was pretty angry and perhaps even somewhat resentful at having to attend that diversity seminar. And I'm really just using this as an example. But what he did was decide that that meant that he had something that he had to say and then look at the consequences of that man. It's an absolutely unbelievable. And so you know, if you're feeling oppressed at work or you're oppressed in your life or, or you know where you're oppressing yourself, then you got to notice that you're feeling oppressed. Then you have to notice that you're feeling resentful, resentful and angry and bitter, and maybe even like Cain in the story of Cain and Abel because Cain is sort of the archetypal bitter man. And then you have to decide what it is that you need to do in order to remove from yourself that bitterness.

Speaker 1:          01:31          And that's usually means that there's something that you have to say and then you have to say it because you're sold depends on it. And not only does your soul depend on it. I would say the fate of the world depends on it because you know you might be wrong and then you should be straightened out. Maybe you're just being whiny and you have to talk to somebody about that. But it may be that you're actually detecting something wrong, some tyranny that's directed towards you and other people, and it's like your moral obligation to speak up about it. And so many workplaces become toxic to use a terrible cliche, cliche because the people in the won't speak up for what they actually want, or they speak up too late and then they're all twisted up about it and, and you know they're torturing other people because they're so unhappy and so forth and so on. So practical approach for developing your shadow fundamentally is radical. Honesty and young said that in a genuine moral effort was a good substitute for psychotherapy.
