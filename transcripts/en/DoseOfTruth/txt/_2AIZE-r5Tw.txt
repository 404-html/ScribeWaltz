Speaker 1:          00:06          Let me, my life for the last year has been so busy that I haven't had proper time to reflect on what's been happening. And even if I did, I wouldn't, I'm not exactly sure I would be able to understand it anyways because it isn't sure I'm not, I don't think I have a framework of reference within which to put it. So I started working for this company called Television TV Ontario about 1516 years ago. I had talked to a producer, his name was Waldeck Shimberg, he's emigrate, Polish Jew and a really smart guy. And he phoned me up at the university. And one of the things that distinguishes me to some degree from my colleagues is that I'll talk to the press and that I'm actually not afraid of them or distrustful love them. Like a lot of my colleagues, not all of them are like, they're critical of the press, partly in an arrogant way and partly in a defensive way.

Speaker 1:          00:58          They say, well, they always get it wrong. It's like, well, first of all there isn't that they and they don't always get it wrong. And you know, they, they, they'll also shy away from the press as if they're being intruded upon when the truth is generally speaking, the ideas that they're putting forward aren't of sufficient interest to draw public attention anyways. And so, but I talked to what EC for a long time and he invited me to go on a couple of, of shows and then uh, then I ended up on [inaudible] the agenda, which is a pretty good public affairs show. It's one of the few, I would say deep new shows left that that are on normal broadcast TV and you know, they go into issues in some depth, although they fragmented that up a bit in recent years. And I became a fairly common guest on those shows and people seem to like what I was saying, which always surprised me.

Speaker 1:          01:49          I mean, but, but it was good because you know, it must be pretty damn horrible to put yourself out in the public eye and face primary criticism for what you're doing. I think that would be unbearable in some sense unless you were very, very strongly constituted. And then, well that went on for awhile and we'll deck was running this a series called big ideas, which was actually quite prescient, you know, so he had lecturers come to Toronto and, and he had all pretty much all the major public intellectuals in the world over a period of about five years or six years or so, come and deliver bare bones lectures of this sort fundamentally need taped them and put them on TV, you know, and, and uh, that was sort of unheard of. The production quality was well high but not overproduced weren't multiple cameras and edits and, and intelligent commentary from people in the background.

Speaker 1:          02:42          It was purely content driven, you know, and it actually got pretty popular on, on iTunes and you can still find the lectures there, but Tvo couldn't they, they, they, they, they pulled the show even though their primary mandate from the government was to educate the public. And this was a very low budget show with very high quality minds that people were actually watching and downloading a lot on iTunes. But they, they didn't seem to take the non standard media with any degree of seriousness. And you know, that's kind of a common human attribute, which is that if you don't know about something, you don't take it seriously. Right. And it's, it's, cause if you don't know about it, well, it's just gray and fuzzy, right? You have no differentiated knowledge. So it's easy to oversimplify it.
