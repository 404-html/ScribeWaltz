Speaker 1:          00:07          and was promoted and not liking it because I have to adjust massively. Is there a difference between liking your job and the lack of discipline to perform a change? Are there, are they connected? Yeah. While they're definitely connected. It's a tough one. Um, the first thing I would say is that if it was a real radical change, you know, it takes people, unless they're very young, it takes people about a year to adjust to a really radical change, like to move to a new city, to, to adjust to being married. That can take longer than a year to adjust to having a new baby to, to getting over a relatively serious loss, like a death in the family a year, you know? And so the first thing you might ask yourself is, are there things that are good about the promotion? The second is, do you have the capacity to do the job or to learn how to do it?

Speaker 1:          01:01          You could talk to someone about that. And then the third thing is have you given yourself enough time to adjust? Because one of the things I often recommend to people when they've made a radical change, like going leaving home and going to universities, don't pay any attention to how you feel for a year because everything is so much up in the air that you can't really trust your own judgment. So you have to give yourself time to adapt and um, you can't expect that that's going to happen overnight. It, it's certainly not. And to put that expectation on yourself increases the probability that you're going to feel bad about it.
