Speaker 1:          00:06          We also have discount by the way, my partners and I decided to,

Speaker 2:          00:14          mmm.

Speaker 1:          00:15          Encourage everybody to

Speaker 2:          00:17          make a,

Speaker 1:          00:20          their new year's resolutions in a sophisticated and comprehensive way. And so we have this program. Some of you have heard about this@selfauthoring.com called future authoring. And the future authoring program helps you write out a vision for the future to think through what you'd like your life to be like if you were taking care of yourself properly, to consider your friends and your family and your career and your education and your use of time outside of work and your ability to resist temptation, the kind of temptation that might drag you down and, uh, and how you might take care of yourself mentally and physically. And to write about that and then to write a counter,

Speaker 1:          01:03          uh, story, which was where you might be three to five years down the road if you let all your bad habits get out of control and then to write a strategic plan. It's a very useful program. We've used it with lots of university students in particular, although it's for, for adults of all ages. Um, and if you're a university student and you complete the program, it seems to increase the probability that you'll stay in university by about 25% something like that. Um, it seems particularly useful by the way, for men, for reasons that we don't exactly understand, maybe because they're underperforming women academically and it also improves people's grades. But there's a large literature in the industrial organizational area also indicating that if you're like, if you're working and you make a personal plan of this sort, then your overall productivity increases by about 10% which is a lot.

Speaker 1:          01:56          And you're, you're more likely to be physically and mentally healthy. And so I would really recommend trying this. Even you can try the program, you don't have to do a perfect job at it. It doesn't really matter because it turned to set out a bit of a vision and a plan for your life. And you need that because you need direction and you need purpose and you need the constraints of a vision to help you be less anxious and uncertain. And, and you, you have that anxiety and uncertainty reduction does occur if you have a decent map of where it is that you're headed.
