Speaker 1:          00:06          Cause that's, I agree exactly with what you just said. So what I, the views that I've come to and study moral psychology is that we is that humans are ultra social apes. We evolved to live in these small groups that are fighting with each other. Uh, we evolved to have these low level animistic religions. That's our steady state. That's the way we were for at least a hundred thousand years are much more, probably closer to a million in some form. Um, so that's sort of our design. That's what we were designed for in a sense. Um, and in that sense were as individuals really kind of stupid tribal creatures designed to do post hoc reasoning. Um, but if you put us together in the right way with the right checks, with the right, the right systems, um, the whole can be vastly smarter than the components that go into it, which is true of the brain, to the brain is composed of neurons.

Speaker 1:          01:04          Each neuron is really kind of stupid little switch. We can put them together in the right way and you get something really brilliant. And in the same way. Um, I don't know the history here, but my understanding is that science begins, or the culture of science, the scientific revolution begins in Europe. Uh, in the 17th century. As you begin getting, you get the printing press so people can share their ideas, but you get communities of people who are challenging each other's ideas. And that's what makes it so brilliant is that is that people have to do their best. We're really bad at this confirming our own ideas. It's very hard to make it very hard to do that. But you put your ideas out there and then everyone else is motivated to challenge them. And so if you put us together in the right way, the truth comes out. And so adversarial systems of law journalists know this. They have to listen to both sides. Scientists know this. Social scientists should know this.
