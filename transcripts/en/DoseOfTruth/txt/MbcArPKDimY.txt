Speaker 1:          00:06          You know, lots of times soldiers develop post traumatic stress disorder because they go out in the battlefield, they're kind of naive. They're young guys, you know, and, and, and, uh, it actually is worse if they're not that bright. It turns out because having a lower Iq is one of the things that predisposes you to post traumatic stress disorder. But anyways, they go out in the battlefield and they see what they're capable of under battlefield conditions. And like, you know, we, we've been fighting wars for a very long time, millions of years. You know, chimps basically have wars with other chimps, the troops, right? Cause the juveniles will patrol the perimeter perimeter of their territory. And if they find other chimps from other troops that they outnumber, they will tear them to pieces like in chimps are really, really strong. And so when I say they'll tear them to pieces, I mean that literally, you know, they, they tear them to pieces.

Speaker 1:          00:56          And Jane Goodall discovered that originally in 1970s she didn't even report it for a while because she was so shocked. You know, she kind of assumed like most followers of roots so that the human proclivity for warfare was part, that part that was something that was a uniquely human. You know, it had something to do with our, our unique self consciousness or our intelligence or something like that. She had no idea that it was rooted that deeply. You know, we split from chimps about six, 7 million years ago, something like that. And so we were patrolling territory. We were gang members 7 million years ago. And you know, it that that's, that's minimum estimation because of course that ancestor shaded back maybe 20 million years into entities that were roughly primate like, and so territoriality and a, and a proclivity to defend territory is so deeply embedded in us. It's, it's, it's like, it's, it's like it's the control center for our whole brain.

Speaker 1:          02:03          And so there isn't anything more important to us, I would say. Then maintaining the match between what we want to have happen and what other people are doing in response to our actions. Like that's that that's what we want. And as long as that match is maintained, then our emotional systems, and I would say anxiety's probably primary in that regard. Our emotional systems remain inhibited. They're on, they're ready, like, like a nuclear reactor. Rods are on and the rest of the brain dampens them down. But it's like it, you don't want them to take time to start it up, man. You want them to be on at a, at a 10th of a second's notice when it's necessary. And so, you know, that's kind of why, well if you look like look at a wild animal, it's like it's alert, it's ready to dark this way or that way, especially a prey animal instantaneously.

Speaker 1:          03:00          And it has reflexes built into it. As you do that, we'll respond way before your conscious. So for example, if you happen to be walking down a trail and you detect something snake, like in the periphery, you'll leap away before you even know that you lapped. And, but that's because it takes a fair bit of time to actually see a snake. By which I mean form a conscious representation of the snake, you know? And maybe it takes a quarter of a second or something like that, or even longer, but it doesn't matter. Maybe it takes, you know, 20th of a second, a 10th of a second. But the thing about the damn snake is it's way faster than that. It's really fast. That thing and it coevolved with primates by the way. And so it can nail you like way faster than you can look at it. So you have your eyes map snake like objects right onto your reflexes so that the eyes go, the eyes make you jump, and then they see after that it's like, yeah, well now you can see that's no problem. You know, so all right. All right.

Speaker 1:          04:07          Now what I would say that what we do is we live in a shared story and the story is a way of looking at the world and its way of acting in the world at the same time. And that story has to operate within narrow parameters. And this is something that's extraordinarily important to understand because, and this is something I think that Piaget figured out, John Piaget figured out better than anyone else. I think he really got this right. And by the way, one of the things that Piaget was trying to do, you never hear about how strange these great thinkers are. But Piaget was a very strange guy and he was a, he was a hyper genius and he was offered the curatorship of a bloody museum when he was 10 years old. You know, cause he wrote this little paper on molluscs which parent?

Speaker 1:          04:47          It was a very good, so they offered him the curatorship of a museum and his parents wrote back and said, well you know, no, probably not because he's, he's actually 10 and so that was Piaget man. The guy was a genius. And you know, he, he was actually motivated by the desire to reconcile science and religion. That was, that was actually his entire motivation for what he did. You never hear that. But that's, that's the case. And so Piaget was very interested in how you produce structures that enable you to regulate yourself. Cause you're like a kind of a, a colony of strange sub animals that have to figure out how to get along so that you can sort of be one thing. You kind of learn that, I would say between the ages of two and four as you're being socialized, you know how erratic two year olds are.

Speaker 1:          05:34          I mean, they're a blast. And it's partly because they were erratic. It's like they're unbelievably happy and then they're unbelievably hungry and then they're really hot. And then they're really upset and crying, you know? And then they're really scared. It's like, and all of that's just untrammeled. And so it's really fun to be around them, especially when they're happy because they're so happy that it's just, you know, you don't ever get to be that happy. And so it's nice to be around a two year old because you can kinda feel that again, you know? And a lot of what the, one of the horrible things about being a parent is that you spend a tremendous amount of your time making your child less happy. And the reason for that is that positive emotion is a very impulsive, you know, and you know, cause everybody says, well you should be happy.

Speaker 1:          06:18          It's like, well no, when you're happy you're actually quite stupid. And so because happiness makes you impulsive, happiness makes happiness, says, hey, things are really good right now. Get Wet. You can while the getting's good. And so as a like if you're a hyper optimistic manic, we'll say it's like every stock investment looks like a really good stock investment. It's like you won't spend all your money because look at, there's those wonderful things everywhere and you could do such great things with them. And then, you know, you spend all your money and then you crash and you think, Oh God, my life's over. You know, cause I just, I just spent all my money on all this useless stuff. And it's all under the grip of impulsive, positive emotion, you know? And so when, when you're telling your kids to be quiet and settled down, it isn't because they're making a lot of noise.

Speaker 1:          07:08          Being in pain is because they're running around like wild baboons having a blast. And disrupting things like mad, you know, and say, wow, you got kids, you got to settle down, you know, like quit having so much fun. And it's, it's kind of awful that you do that, but, but you do. And that's because the emotions and the motivations have to be brought into like a relationship with one another within the person. So that, you know, one thing I remember with my son who is quite, he's quite disagreeable by temperament, which is actually a good thing as far as I'm concerned, although it brings its own challenges. And so with my daughter, when she was misbehaving, she was pretty agreeable and uh, you know, if she was misbehaving, I can basically just look at her and then she'd quit, you know, but my son, it was like, that was just nothing.

Speaker 1:          08:01          You're looking at me. It's like, no, that's just not going to go anywhere, man. And so then I'd like tell him to stop. And that really wasn't having much of an effect either. He just sort of maybe laugh or run away or whatever. I mean, he was a tough little rat. And you know what? I would do with him is he would be doing something and identity or, and he'd get upset and you know, angry. And so then I get them to sit on the steps and I had told him, this is when he was about to, I said, look, you're going to sit on the steps. That's time out. You're going to sit on the steps until you've got control of yourself and you can come back and be and play the family game again. I basically said, be a civilized human being and then you're welcome again.

Speaker 1:          08:42          And so he'd sit on the steps. It was so interesting to watch because he was just enraged. He'd sit there like if you ever seen a two year old have a temper Tantrum, it's really quite the bloody phenomena. If you ever saw an adult do that, you'd like, you'd call nine one one right away. It's like, oh my God. And I've seen adults do that. You know, because people say with borderline personality disorder will have temper tantrums and it's like, man, you want to be about 30 feet away from that person. That's for sure. It's really, but in kids it's like, well first of all, they're only this long, so how much trouble can they really cause? But it's like, you know, they're just completely gone there. Like on the floor or their face is red. They're just furious. Like way more furious than you ever get if you're even vaguely socialized there.

Speaker 1:          09:26          Just outraged and they're kicking and hitting the ground and like, it's like a little epileptic fit of anger. You know, they're completely controlled by their rage. And we took care of one kid for a while who he was actually a pushover, that kid, you could get them to behave by, you know, kind of shaking your finger at him. But his mother thought he was really tough because he had her, he had her figured out and one of the things he would do is have a territory temper tantrum. And during the temper tantrum he would hold his bloody breath until he turned blue. It's like, try that. Like, you know, as that's your homework, go home and go home and have a temper tantrum and while you're doing it, hold your breath until you actually turn blue. It's like you won't be able to do it.

Speaker 1:          10:06          You don't have the willpower of a two year old now. That's for sure. That little varmint man, he just have a fit. Then he'd hold his breath and then he'd turn blue. It was like, wow, that's, that's amazing. And we would just like, let him do it. You know, he turned blue and everybody would be gone and he'd come out of it, you know, and it didn't work. So he just quit doing it. I think he did it like twice and he figured out, oh well that's a lot of work for very little outcome. And you know, it's not like two year olds are stupid. They're, they're not stupid. They're probably smarter than you, but they're not civilized by any stretch of the imagination. And so anyways, back to my son, I'd put him on the steps and he'd be like, [inaudible] just like aged and, and trying to get himself together, you know? And I wait a few few, I kind of strict rule, which was as soon as you're done, you're welcome again. So it's completely under your control. You, you get yourself calmed down, you come and talk to me again. If you're calm enough, so I like you, then you're welcome back in the family. No grudge or nothing.
