Speaker 1:          00:07          Okay. So now tell me how many, how many members, you don't have to discuss any of this obviously, but how many members of Heterodox Academy are there now? We have 1300 members. So once we opened up, it's originally was just where we searchers who were studying this problem, but we had lots of people wanting to join. And so we said, well, okay, why not? And so we just said, all right, if as long as you're a professor, um, that is, you have a phd, you're living more or less the life of a professor, you have a university affiliation. So we now take adjuncts if they have a phd, uh, we take postdocs basically if you're in the guild, if you're living the life of a professor and you're concerned about the rise of intimidation, frankly, if you're concerned that our wonderful institution I love, I love being a professor.

Speaker 1:          00:54          I Love Adam and I feel like it's not just losing public respect, it's losing its ability to, to function. It's losing its ability to teach and do research on politicized topics. So there were more politicized topics all the time. That's, that's right. And there are few in the natural sciences, not many, but there are some of the natural sciences as well. Anyway, my point is we're now growing very rapidly and something I'm very excited by is since we've started having more violence on campus with beginning with birth and Middlebury, we're seeing a pervasive sense among people on the left that there really is this problem here that something has to be done. And so we are finding much more acceptance now, um, from professors on the left. So I like to think about there's the liberal left, which is the great majority, and there's the illiberal left.

Speaker 1:          01:40          We did a factor analysis of politically correct beliefs and found exactly that and that the, and that the illiberal left was also high in orderliness. That's interesting. That's the authoritarian. Exactly. Predisposition. Yeah. And also kind of markedly declined. It was also characterized by a market, lack of verbal intelligence. Oh, that's 0.4. Well that, oh, that's beautiful. That's beautiful. Because one of the simplest formulations I've heard really great formulation from Mark Lilla. So Mark Lilla wrote this fantastic op ed. The New York Times week after Trump was elected saying identity politics is a really foolish thing to do. It pushes lots of people over to Trump's side. The identity politics as part of the problem. Well, he writes this hotbed and one of his fellow professors at Columbia, I forget how she does it, but she basically says something about the, you know, the mask with eye holes falls from his face.

Speaker 1:          02:31          Like, you know, he's a Ku Klux Klan members, something like that. And so Lilla Lilla who isn't humanities, he's an intellectual historian. Lilla has this simple formulation. He says that's a slur, not an argument. And once they had that simple formulation, I realized, wow, that's almost all the push back I've ever gotten. It's somehow, you know, oh, you know, you're winking at Nazis or your comfort to me over and over. I was just, my neighborhood was just posters with all that intimidation. So, so this is really key. We're supposed to be all about, you can say anything you want, you can make any argument you want. If you can support it, if you can back it with reasons. This is critical thinking and this is what we're supposed to train our students to do. Well. And not only that, you can say anything, but you can say it.

Speaker 1:          03:18          There's a boundary on that, which, especially if you're a scientist, less so in the humanities. But if you're a scientist, the things you say have to be vetted by people who are going to be critical of them. Right. So, so not only do, not only [inaudible] there's accountability built into it. That's right. So I didn't mean to say you can say whatever you want, this brand. I mean you can put forth any idea you want, if you can back it up. What we're seeing with anything politicize is it's not about backing it up. Students are learning rhetorical techniques to link their enemies to something racist. Contemptible some tangible that's bad. Those are the things that are not only worthy of being destroyed, but that you have a moral duty to destroy. Exactly. So that's right. So it's almost like the immune system, how exactly it works.

Speaker 1:          04:04          But there's some cell that tags Acel as you know, enemy, enemy. And once that tad was put on the cell that attracts other, I forget what kind of cell to [inaudible]. And so we should look into this, this metaphor of the immune system, because you know, once they know, once you're labeled as a racist, students don't have to read you that. It doesn't matter what you actually say. You will now be a tap. It's also too that once you're labeled that way, if someone defends you, the label is contagious. And it's our dynamic. That's how we know where in this super religious territory of witch hunts that if you stand up for someone, you are tagged and then you will be mobbed. Right? And that's why there's so much disease that, and that's why there's so much cowardice on campus among both students and faculty. People are afraid to stand up, even if the majority think that what's going on is nuts or is unfair.

Speaker 1:          04:53          They're afraid to stand up. And that's in part due to social media because it's just, I mean, students today had been raised with various platforms that make it easy for people to join in attack someone they look at who liked what. So if in that article we just saw on read, uh, there was a bit of a counterrevolution and read the students had to get together somehow and decide should I like that post? How about if we all liked it at the same time, then we'll get in less trouble. Okay. Okay. So to what degree, so let's talk about the aims of the Heterodox Academy. So you've brought people together who are in principle interested in a diversity of opinions and, but, but in what manner is that going to be utilized to, to, to, I don't want to use the word combat, but to, but to deal with this emergent problem of ideological rigidity in the university.

Speaker 1:          05:44          So, uh, two useful concepts here. One is the emperor's new clothes. Um, we all know that story. Um, even if most people, even if everybody sees this is nuts, the empress walking around with no clothes, they're afraid to say it until one person says it. So, and this is also the ash experiment. Everybody says that that line is the same as that line is obviously not true. If one person says the truth, then nobody conforms after that. So the mere presence of a group of people who say, you know what, we actually need a diversity of opinions. And the fact that on our site we'll publish things. So sometimes when professors are mob, like when Bret Weinstein, you know, was mobbed, you know, so I wrote an essay that stood up for him. Uh, we've done that for some of them. It's happening so fast. I can't keep up.

Speaker 1:          06:24          I can't, I've got books to write and I, you know, every week there's some new member was getting mobbed. And so we're going to develop a team of people who will write. But just knowing that there are people who will stand up for you, um, knowing that there are people who will say, wait a second, this is not what we do in the academy. So that's one thing is we just stand up for each other too, is we develop products that we think can basically fix the situation. So one of our products is called the campus expression survey. It's a survey designed to actually measure who was afraid of speaking up about what topics and why, what are they afraid of? And it turns out everyone's afraid of the students more than the faculty. Uh, they're afraid of mostly to talk about race. What about the administrators?

Speaker 1:          07:06          Everyone's afraid of the students. They're afraid of the students. So I don't have, we've not sorted them. I've only surveyed students. Okay. But from what we hear, um, uh, people are afraid of, of the students, um, you know, well, that's what your hauling, hauling in its own manner. Like was that real of leaders? That's for sure. They let those kids come into the classroom, the actual classroom and disrupt a class on an ongoing basis. I mean, yes and I couldn't understand that exactly. I mean, my response to that would be first I would tell them to leave. Second, I would call campus security. Third, if something wasn't done about it, I just wouldn't teach the class. So I don't understand like it, it seems to me that it's also up to individual professors to draw a line, which is that if you're being intimidated, dated by students, why do you, why do you show up and teach the class?

Speaker 1:          07:57          I don't understand that. Yeah. So again, people are afraid to stand up if it means that people will call you a racist, Cabot God. I mean it's, it's weird and that situation though, because it's carried to third to go to your class, you know, and there's a much more proximal thread there. That's what I mean. What I'm most alarmed by is the rise of intimidation. Intimidation is now a factor in many aspects of academic life. And that's just terrible. That's completely incompatible with, with what we do and who we are. Well, it's especially, it's especially appalling given that whatever happens in the university campuses, you know, like one of the questions I've faced in Canada as well, why should we care about what's happening in the, in the Ivy Tower is going to hire these people next year. You are? Yeah. Well it's the heart. Like what's happening in the campuses is going to happen in society in five years.

Speaker 1:          08:45          It's already hot goats. It's already happening. So this is actually an important, um, I, I just gave a talk at a, at a big law firm here in New York where they're very devoted to diversity, but they're doing it right. They're really about diversity. Why is diversity good? And so they have a whole month on viewpoint diversity, which is just fantastic. And what I'm learning from talking to a number of people in the business world is that in the last year, they're now all these pressures on leaders to endorse this condemned that signed this open letter and coming into human resources. That's right. That's right. But it's the same dynamic we have on campus and the answer to it. So if anybody, anybody watching here, if you run a business, if you have friends who are in business, I think the only, the, the, the, they're only two stable equilibria.

Speaker 1:          09:27          One is that every organization is just either, all right wing were all left wing, but that would be disastrous. So you, so are there, you just say, okay, we're on one side, that'd be terrible. The other is what we call the Chicago principles of free expression. The University of Chicago has the best statement out there on how the university provides a platform on which multiple views can contest. The university does not take anyone's side. That's the only other stable alternative. And I think leaders need to do this in business. It certainly universities. So we're encouraging every university to adopt the Chicago principles because a lot of what mass action is, is an attempt to compel the authority to come in on your side and punish your enemies. Yup.
