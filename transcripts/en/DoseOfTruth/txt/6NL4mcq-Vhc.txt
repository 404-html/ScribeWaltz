Speaker 1:          00:00          Hmm,

Speaker 1:          00:06          I would like to move onto discussing myths. This is so interesting. So I would just say one more thing because I, if you, uh, if you talk to these people about how we can reconstruct homosexuals, I mean, can you send, can you send them to a straight camp? I mean all of them would say that's horrible, but if you ask about how can you deconstruct and then reconstruct boys and their masculinity, all of them are aboard. So. Yeah. So, so it's, it's a very inconsistent. Well, I mean, one of the things I complained about last year with regards to this build cc see legislation in Canada, as I said, look, you're instantiating a social constructionist view of gender, gender, expression, sexual proclivity, all of these things into the law. Okay? So it's socially constructed. Okay. So wake up. The Conservatives who have been, uh, opposing homosexuality for the last hundred years have used nothing but social constructionist arguments.

Speaker 1:          01:15          They basically say, well, if it's socially constructed or an individual choice, which is, by the way, now it's stantiating into Canadian law, then why the hell can't you just be reeducated out of it? Or just drop it if it's just an individual choice. Well, I tried to say you're, yeah, you're playing with fire the fire that will consume you. Okay. But you know, okay, nobody, nobody. No, I shouldn't say nobody. These arguments are, these arguments are subtle and, and they're not easy to follow. And so, and the problem is, is that the consequences of producing legislation like that unfold over decades, not minutes. Yeah. So I don't know. Did you see what happened at Wilfrid laurier university in Canada last week, two weeks ago? Lindsay Shepherd. Does that ring a bell? I listened to the conversation. She recorded. Yeah. So in Canada now, three things are happening.

Speaker 1:          02:17          The first is, despite the fact that I predicted this and that the only reason my reputation was ever let's say tarnished, was because I predicted that this was going to happen. I'm still being vilified by people who, even, who, who are admitting nonetheless, that what happened at Wilford Laurey was reprehensible. Okay? So that's one thing. The second thing is the people that Laurie, who used, who accused Lynsay of breaking the Canadian federal and provincial laws are being accused of misinterpreting those laws, which they aren't as far as I'm concerned, but that enables people to save face. And third and most a fair number of faculty members and public commentators are claiming that Ramboo, Kana and pim lot and Joel, who were the interlocutors in the inquisition are the true victims, but really? Oh absolutely. Because now, now that people have been. Well, first of all, they were only standing up for trans rights and second, well because they've been the target of substantial criticism, let's say like overwhelming, punishing, brutal criticism on ending for weeks while they're that they're now victims because that's just not fair.

Speaker 1:          03:38          And so when the president could Wilfrid laurier university apologized to lynsay shepherd, she also said, but you know, I also feel, I also feel that what has happened to the faculty members in the aftermath of this faculty members and administrators was also raw. So like, it's that typical thing. You know, you see this when kids get bullied in schools. Now is that the idiot interveners and they're and they're blind. Humanitarian impulse is bringing the bully and the victim into the principal's office to discuss it, assuming equal, equal causal, what would you call it? Responsibility on the part of the victim and the perpetrator, and they think that, well, if they just had a nice talk about it, then we could be settled. Not understanding at all that the bully who's, let's say one of these, one in 100 Predator types, it's just going to stand on the outside of the school ground and wait for the victim to come by and just pound the hell out of him because that's how bullies work. It's like, well, we could settle it like reasonable people. And he's like, yeah, right. You're so God damn naive that you know, if evil ever popped out and made a face at you, which would likely will. You'd be scared into posttraumatic stress disorders so fast. You wouldn't know what hit you. And I've seen that plenty of times in my clinical practice.
