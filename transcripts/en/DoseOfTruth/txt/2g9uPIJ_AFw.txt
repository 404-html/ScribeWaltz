Speaker 1:          00:07          Position would be would be that,

Speaker 2:          00:11          okay,

Speaker 1:          00:12          you should try to become aware of the totality of your subjective experience, so not only do you feel it in an embodied sense, but that you represented at a that you represented and the representation would be mostly in terms of articulation. It isn't clear that Roger is considered other forms of representation, but Roger's the movement towards health is an integrative process and it's very body focused, but the outcome of that integrative process which Rogers would say is the ability to live the good life is that your language is no longer instrumental. What you're doing instead is attempting to state the truth as you see it because of course your truth is a partial truth. Obviously the basket you can do is, well, I really think the best you can do is not live if you can't tell the truth because you're too damn stupid, right? You don't know enough to tell the truth, but you can certainly do your best to represent what you know is clearly as you possibly can in your communication with other people. And so rogers believed that it was the moral responsibility of the therapist to do that personally and then to the degree that that was being done in the therapy and the therapy relationship in the therapeutic relationship, that that in and of itself would be healing. And so basically Roger's theory is that honest communication heels. No, you know, that's quite an interesting theory.

Speaker 1:          01:55          No, it's not. It's not completely unaligned from Freud's earlier claims, right? Because Freud basically presumed that it was.

Speaker 1:          02:09          I didn't put so much of a moral element on it. He really viewed the person more as as being trapped between titanic opposing forces, the IED underneath and the superego and top important illegals are crunched up in the middle and as a consequence of being pulled and product and crushed by those titanic forces, pathology was likely to emerge and he talked about repression, but for tended to view repression as an unconscious process for for Rogers, the moral element of the therapeutic process is much clearer, I believe, and most of the time when you listen to Rogers or you read what he had to say, the injunctions that he's laying out or moral injunctions. Now, it's quite interesting because you don't necessarily think of psychotherapy as a moral endeavor and I really never thought about it that way fully until I read. I was reading Rogers at the same time, but you don't tow weight out the proposition in this book that most of the problems, many of the problems that people came to see a therapist about, we're actually moral problems and they were moral problems of various sorts. Now sometimes the person was in trouble because they had done something seriously, seriously wrong.

Speaker 1:          03:32          He had one client, if I remember correctly,

Speaker 1:          03:38          and he discovered, if I remember correctly, that she had killed her children and she did that when they were young. She had them. She let them become exposed to tuberculosis. I think it was. She didn't take the proper precautions and the reason she did that was because she wanted to marry someone and he wasn't very interested in her children. So you might consider that a moral problem on your. Apparently apparently it was weighing on her conscience, you know, as it might. Well now it's a strange thing because in some sense what she did was turn a blind eye to something she could have prevented it in legal terms that's known as willful blindness, but she knew whatever that means. Well, there's lots of different levels of knowing, right? You can know something in your body, you can know something in your imagination. You can know something in articulated form, you know, so the whole issue of knowing is a very complicated. But Rogers definitely believed as far as I can tell, that there was a moral dimension to life that it was identifiable. That in some sense, it was linear that had had an observable process, which was the continual integration of experience within the phenomenal field, the ironing out of contradictions within the phenomenal field.
