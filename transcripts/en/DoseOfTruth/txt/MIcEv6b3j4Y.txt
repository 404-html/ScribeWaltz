Speaker 1:          00:06          Would you consider a more official consultancy role with Andrew Scheer's Conservative Party? Uh, it's very difficult to say what I would consider. It isn't obvious to me that Andrew Scheer would particularly like to have me as no official consultant time kind of a, what might you describe a controversial? Yes, that's the word right now. And so, you know, it's funny though because I was making this new video today, which I alluded to earlier, using good old, what's this character here? A Hitler, the Hitler, the spokes frog. And uh, I, I went back and looked at my comments on bill [inaudible] last year, which, which were the comments that originally got me in hot water and had me accused of all the things I've been accused of Transphobia, bigotry, racism. Um, what else? Oh, you fascism being on the far right. And then finally, and to top it all off, Hitler himself.

Speaker 1:          01:06          And one of the things that I realized was that, that I was really calm during that video. You couldn't have really. I couldn't have offered a more mild mannered criticism, a bill [inaudible]. And it's pretty funny because, you know, I'm this scandal that engulfed Wilford Laurey a this week is the worst scandal that I remember involving a university in, in, in my memory, going back to the 19 seventies. And what happened at Laurie was exactly what I predicted would happen except it was actually worse because they did accuse Lynsay of breaking the law spill, see 16 specifically. And if contravening the Ontario Human Rights Code, which I, you know, for all I know she might've done. So we're, we're at this situation where a Ta showing a video of someone discussing pronouns and candidate can now be termed a hate crime and illegal provincially and federally. And like all the usual suspects have come out of there.

Speaker 1:          02:10          Their caves, let's say. I'm like Brenda Cossman, the lawyer I debated last year and said, well, it's a real stretch to assume that what Lindsay Shepherd did was, was, you know, sufficiently reprehensible to actually constitute a violation of the Ontario Human Rights Commission guidelines, policies, uh, hits a stretch. So I guess we're supposed to feel good about that. But, um, I'm probably a little bit too hot right now to serve in any official consultant role. Uh, that doesn't mean that I wouldn't be happy to speak to, you know, political figures who might be interested in speaking with me because, you know, I generally speak to people who asked me to speak to them. So, um, as reprehensible as that might be.
