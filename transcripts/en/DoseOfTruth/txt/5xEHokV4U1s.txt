Speaker 1:          00:08          I probably Matt, Matt massacre that name says who has a higher Iq. I really gifted mathematician or a really gifted painter, very difficult to say. Um, but I would say that gifted math, because if they're both gifted, they both have high Iq, so you can be certain of that. It's very difficult to do anything that's truly gifted, say above the average, above the norm without being, without having a very high Iq and in a creative realm. I mean you hear about these idiot savant who have like one area of extreme expertise, but generally in those cases it's not so much that they have one area of extreme expertise, it's that they have one area of above average expertise that really contrast with the rest of their impairments, but they rarely if ever, make it into the, you know, the very short list of true geniuses.

Speaker 1:          01:01          Mathematicians are kind of an odd bunch though because you, they peek really, really early. Like if you're going to be a mathematician and truly gifted, then you're going to show signs of that when you're like 17 to 20 something like that. Whereas painters can, can be creative through their entire lifespan. Um, I would say probably on average, I would guess this is a guest that if you took a hundred really gifted mathematicians and a hundred really gifted painters, that the mathematicians would have far higher nonverbal Iq, but the painters might have higher verbal Iq was. So that also complicates things seat with Iq. Also, you know, there's, there's this factor called the g factor, which is the central element of intelligence. And it seems to be associated with such things as head size and brain size relative to body and neural conduction speed and simple reaction time, like really basic physiological markers. Um, and it's a pretty tight single factors say as opposed to the personality dimension domain where there's five quite clear factors. But I think it was Earl hunt research indicated that as people get smarter and smarter, the variability between the subsets of their intelligence starts to increase. So it's sort of like, there's a lot of ways to be really smart, but there's only one way to be not very smart. So, um, that's another little tidbit of information with regards to Iq.
