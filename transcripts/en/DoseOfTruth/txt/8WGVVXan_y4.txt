Speaker 1:          00:00          Hmm.

Speaker 2:          00:06          What is the experience of believing in God and how is that qualitatively, qualitatively different from a person who says that he doesn't?

Speaker 1:          00:15          I see what you mean by that is that is part of the question. The question is here while the. When someone says, do you believe in God? No, there's three parts to that question. The first question is who is the you to which they are referring? Let turns out to not be it. A simple question. I mean Neesha did a very good job of taking apart the idea of the eye, you know, because he was, he was critiquing descartes' I think therefore I am. And, and so the idea, the first question is, well, who is the you to which you are referring. The second is what do you mean by belief? The third is what do you mean by God? It's like you can't just leap to the assumption that the person asking the question and the person answering the question have the same views on those and I think that that's, that's part of the reason why I don't like the question.

Speaker 1:          01:05          You know, like I said, well I act as if I believe in God, and so I would say that's the more, that's the most fundamental manifestation of faith, but I could also say I believe and don't believe in God and saying, well, you can't. You can't think both of those things at the same time. It's like, well, hell yeah, that's what you think. It's, it's, it's in, in. When you were asking something that complicated, then there's absolutely no reason to assume that you can't have paradoxical responses to it. So you could. You could even say maybe that the injunction in the old testament is something like, you should believe that not believe in God [inaudible]. It's very complicated. It's not. It's not by any means. A simple question.

Speaker 2:          01:55          I don't remember his name though, but I think perhaps it was a burger or something like that. He said that myth is about reconciling contradictions within the human.

Speaker 1:          02:07          Exactly. That's exactly. Well, that's what a successful myth does and part of the reason that these ideologies that we've been discussing feminism power so much power is because they actually draw their motive force from an underlying religious substrate, but they only tell half the story and that's what ended theology is. So when the feminists say, culture is that tyrannical patriarch, it's like, yeah, that's true, but it's also the benevolent wise king. So like, well then they say, well, I can't be one and the other at the same time, and the answer is, well, it's a multidimensional phenomena that you're encapsulating within a single category. It can contain contradictions. In fact it does because society obviously constraints and and kills you even like you dye into your neural configuration because when you were first born, you have more neural connections than you will ever in your life and most of them die.

Speaker 1:          03:07          And so so you dye into your four year old self and then between the ages of 16 and 20, you dye into your adult self. And so the idea that the society that you're in is a terrible tyrant. That shapes you by death is exactly true, but by the same token, it's also almost everything that ennobles you and enables you to function in the world. And so the critic, critics of the Patriarchy say tyranny, tyranny, tyranny. And it's like, yeah, yeah, tyranny, but not only tyranny. And they say evil man, evil man. It's like, yeah, obviously, but not only evil man. Not only that, and that's why a genuine mythologies, and I would put Freudian Psycho analysis in that category because Freud had a very balanced view of the nature of being talks about both parts of the paradox at the same time, you know, it's the dragon and the gold. It's the terrible devouring mother and the, and the Virgin Mary. It's the tyrant and the wise king. It's Christ and sait. It's all of those paradoxes stacked on top of one another. And then the story about how you go about dealing with them. That's a true religious myth.

Speaker 2:          04:24          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          04:25          And, and the dog just takes a part of that and says, this is the whole.

Speaker 2:          04:31          In early Christianity, there was a large battle between many keiths and, uh, the. And what would turn out to be the Catholic Church and the mainstream church and, and they said that the evil evil was the world we live in is created by this other force, the demiurge so that the, they had a very split vision of good and evil. But what you're saying and what you were saying about these ideologies is that basically it's perhaps it's a new formal theological battle between glowsticks and the people that say that this is, we have both sides,

Speaker 1:          05:15          both sides. That's a perfectly reasonable way of looking at it, you know, and like young tended towards Manichaean as to some degree because he was so struck by say the evils of, of have nazi-ism. And he, he had a hard time with the idea that evil was only the absence of good. But, and I thought about that a lot because I'm a great admirer of Yoga and you criticize anything he said at your peril, you know, because he was a great genius. But I think that, I think the Manichaean view is wrong. I think that what evil is, is the absence of good. And then it takes on its own life. I think it's, I mean, I've written about this in my new book quite extensively because I have a book coming out in January called 12 rules for life, an antidote to chaos and I'd be trying to take those ideas apart and to grapple with, well, with the fact that human beings hate themselves because they're vulnerable and malevolent, which, which is original sin, you know, which is something I'm a great believer in.

Speaker 1:          06:13          Um, I think it's an unbelievably sophisticated way of looking at the world. You know, that there's something that, there was something damaged in the fabric of being itself. I, I believe that to be the case. I think we experienced that as human beings and that our ethical obligation is to rectify that and to determine how to rectify that, to overcome the vulnerability and malevolence that like the terror of vulnerability and the subjection to malevolence that characterizes our day to day existence. That's our, that's our primary mode of proper being in the world. That seems to me to be correct. So, and again, that's the sort of thing that I've been trying to tell. Well those who will listen, let's say, but it's so far, it's mostly been young men who are dying for this message. Like they're dying for it, you know, it's really Connie's, I go to these talks now, you know, public talks and where I speak about responsibility and truth and like after the talks, there are crowds of mostly young men who line up and say, you know, I was nihilistic, I was desperate, I was suicidal, I was malevolent and resentful and like going bad places.

Speaker 1:          07:30          And I've started listening to what you've been saying about myth and it's like brought me out of that horrible hole. And it's just one person after another says the same thing. You know, it's so, and I've had thousands of letters like that and maybe tens of thousands now I can't even begin to keep up with them. And well, thank God for that. You know.
