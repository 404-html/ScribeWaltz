Speaker 1:          00:00          I have her friend lives in Montreal, his name is James. Simon is a great painter and he's taught me a lot of things, helped. He's helped me design my house and beautify it and I bought some paintings from him a couple of years ago and he did this series of paintings where he went around North America and stood in different places and then he painted the view from here down and so it's his feet planted in different places on roads in the desert on the ocean. I have one actually hanging over my toilet, which is him standing at a urinal. Yeah. Well, you know, he was trying to make a point and the point was that wherever you are, it's worth paying attention and that's because you know, so all these places that he visited, he looked exactly where he was standing by the side of the road and the desert sort of mundane in some sense, but then maybe he put 40 hours into that painting.

Speaker 1:          00:51          You know, when it's very, very realistic painting with really good light. And what he's telling you as a painter is everything is worth paying attention to. An infinite amount, but you don't have enough time and so the artists does that for you, right? The artist looks and looks and looks and locks and locks and then gives you that vision and so then you can look at the painting and it reminds you that, right where you are is there's every. Everything that there is is right where you are and that's a hard thing to realize, but it's actually true.
