Speaker 1:          00:09          The player formerly known as most cops is. What do you think the role of the psychedelics will be in the future? Marijuana will most likely be somewhat legal everywhere in the u s and this may push someone to try stronger. Psychedelics. Is this bad? Let's start with the first one. I have no idea what the role was. Psychedelics will be in the future. I know that the FDA just cleared ecstasy for use for pro post traumatic stress disorder. So that's very interesting. I know there's some very interesting work being done at Johns Hopkins on silicide mushrooms, which seemed to be very effective for example, in helping people stop smoking. I think that we don't know anything about psychedelics at all. I mean we know that they seem to have an effect on the serotonin system, but that's a pretty broad brush stroke. Um, I think there incalculably um, peculiar and that they reveal things about the structure of the world that we are beyond ignorant about beyond ignorant.

Speaker 1:          01:05          But I have no idea what role they'll play in the future. I don't know what to think about psychedelics at all. Um, marijuana will most likely be somewhat legal everywhere in the u s and this may push some to try stronger psychedelics. Is this bad? I suppose it depends on how they're used, whether or not it's bad and what the intent is. I think there are very bad party drugs. Psychedelics aren't, aren't for fun. I don't think that that's the right way to use them at all. I think they need to be used seriously and they need to be used in a manner that's life affirming and they need to be used in a manner that's commensurate with genuine exploration and they need to be used carefully or they can cause a lot of trouble. So Carl Jung said, beware of unearned wisdom. And I think that's very wise. So, um, anyways, I hope that we continue investigating them scientifically because there's much to be learned there much more than we can imagine as far as I'm concerned.
