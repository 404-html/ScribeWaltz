Speaker 1:          00:09          After the big ideas thing, a act came into my classes and tape maps of meaning and made 1330 minutes, uh, TV shows out of them. And that was pretty interesting. And they were broadcast and kind of evanescent because at that point they weren't put on the web. So they're broadcast, they pretty much disappear. Right. And um, so, so, so, so fine. So, and I got some degree of, what would you say I got? I was exposed, my ideas were exposed to a large number of people, tens of thousands of people as a consequence of that. And that seemed to go pretty well. And so then youtube came along and I thought, well, I don't know what this is, this youtube thing, you know, the comments section makes you like, what would you say wary about being human? I would say generally speaking, and you know, there was a lot of, well there were a lot of things that it would be easy to be contemptuous of on Youtube, like the canonical cute cat videos.

Speaker 1:          01:12          But I'm actually not so contemptuous of that or the interesting animal videos because I think they actually speak to a part of people that's actually quite good. We like cats, we like dogs, we think animals are kind of cool. And you know, we take a break and look at, look at something that's pleasant and cute and maybe that's not so bad. It's not serious, but it's certainly not malevolent. And that's something. So I thought, okay, well I'll find these old videos I did for Tvo and I'll put them up on youtube and maybe I'll just take my classes. And so I set up because I have this theory that if it's worth doing, it's worth doing badly. Which you know, it's true, but it's also true that if it's worth doing, it's worth doing well. You just need to know when to apply those two principles.

Speaker 1:          01:57          And if you're loath to do something and procrastinating, then sometimes it's better to do it badly. And I thought, well I can't get a whole production studio up and running and cause I just don't have the time. I'll get an IPAD and learn to use it. And get an level ear mic and just set the thing up or maybe have a student film it. And so I did that for a couple of years for my personality class in this maps of meaning class, which is the class where I outlined this sorts of ideas that I just described to you. And, uh, last April I noticed that I'd had a million views and about 15,000 subscribers, you know, and I thought, Huh, million views, hey, that's an actually a lot of views. It's like if I, I've never write a scientific paper that's been read a million times, no one has, that just never happens.

Speaker 1:          02:45          Right. That's happened zero times. If it, if you have a paper that's cited, you know, someone else refers to it and one of their scientific papers a hundred times, it's like, that's a home run and a thousand times is a miracle. So, and then if you write a book, you know, there's, I think 1.2 million books published last year, something like that. And I think 500 of them sold more than a hundred thousand copies. So that's a sea of books, right? It's, it's an ocean of books and all of them fail really. So, so many of them fail that you might as well never write a book because the probability that it will fail is like 99.99%. And that would be very depressing if it wasn't the case that that's the case for anything creative you ever do. So it's just baseline probability. But I thought, well, if I wrote a book and it sold a million copies, man, I'd be out dancing in the street.

Speaker 1:          03:34          Uh, probably not. But you know, you get the idea. So what does it mean to have a million youtube views? Well, who the hell knows? Right? I mean, we don't have metrics for that. We don't know what sort of influence that's having. We don't know anything about that. We don't know whether we should take it seriously or, or if it's or who you're talking to or anything. But I thought, well, still it's a million then that's a lot. And I thought, well, maybe this is, this is more serious thing than I initially envisioned. And then I really thought about it and I thought,

Speaker 2:          04:08          okay,

Speaker 1:          04:08          oh, I get it. Here's a hypothesis. You know, back in the medieval times and before if you wanted to book someone had to copy it by hand. And so there weren't any books and they were very expensive. And so, and then Gutenberg came along and invented the movable type press and it was like poof. Books were inexpensive and everybody could have them and not like was that was a major revolution, right? It within 400 years, almost everyone in the western world and then very rapidly, almost everyone in the entire world was literate. He could read silently even, which was something that before that was reserved for a very small number of people because most people read out loud when they read it all. So that was a massive revolution. And then I thought, wait a minute, maybe youtube is a Gutenberg revolution because it allows the spoken word to have the same reach and longevity as a book

Speaker 1:          05:04          for the first time in human history, spontaneous speeches can reach an infinite audience for eye for an unspecified duration of time. Well, that's a whole new thing. That's a, that's an entirely new thing. And maybe it's easier for people to listen than it is for them to read. You know? I mean, I'd rather read than listen cause I can read way faster than I can listen. But people will listen to a youtube video at twice the normal speed, sometimes more. So you can circumvent that. And then also with a youtube video, if you convert it into a podcast, let's say, which I'll get to to a moment, you all of a sudden have way more time than you used to have because you can listen to a podcast while you're doing other things. So you can do mundane, the mundane things that you have to do from day to day, like commute and so on.

Speaker 1:          05:54          But you can listen to a podcast. And I've found that my, my young students are now listening to podcasts instead of music. And that's really something, you know, because music of course, it's been an unbelievably dynamic cultural force for maybe the, the primary artistic cultural force for what maybe maybe since the 1950s anyways. And that's being supplanted to some degree by podcasts. And that's really something. And then it also turns out that people have an appetite for long, detailed podcasts that are deep and informative. It's like, who the hell would've guessed that? Like no one. It's it. It just sorta came out of nowhere. And so I thought, well, maybe this is worth taking seriously.
