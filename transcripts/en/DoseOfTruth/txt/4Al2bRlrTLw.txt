Speaker 1:          00:00          What is my opinion on open relationships, polyamory, other forms of non monogamy? Well, I think that as a medium to longterm strategy, they're completely untenable because human beings, as far as I'm concerned, are fundamentally pair bonding and you know, if you're just talking about casual sex, first of all, I think casual sex is a contradiction in terms. I don't think there's anything about sex that's casual and I think that people are deceiving themselves badly whenever they think so they might like to live in a, you know, 19 seventies playboy, adolescent fantasy. But I don't, I've never seen that work under any circumstances whatsoever. And I think people get hurt badly. It's also a bad medium to longterm strategy because, you know, pair bonding is a, is the most stable arrangement we know of at least so far. Well, I won't even put it that way.

Speaker 1:          00:47          It's the only stable a mode of being that we know for the long run and that's especially the case when you bring children into the equation. So, um, I think it's delusional fundamentally. And I think that people who are, who believe that such things work. I mean, sometimes they're open people in their creative and their exploratory and all of that and fair enough, but often they're just unconscientious and they don't want to take any responsibility and they want to live in this wish fulfillment fantasy where everybody can have all the sex they want all the time and it's always wonderful and no one gets hurt and it's like, sorry, that just doesn't work in the real world.
