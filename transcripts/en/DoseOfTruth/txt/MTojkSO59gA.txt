Speaker 1:          00:00          Right

Speaker 1:          00:07          David Maxwell, I scored the Zeros percentile for conscientious in the 84th for neuroticism. How do I improve these scores? Well, okay, so the first thing David you might want to think about is like if all of your scores were low, then there's some possibility that you're being too hard on yourself. And what I would recommend Danny's get a couple of friends to fill out the questionnaire for, for you to describe you and then see if first of all, if there's any agreement to see if they've. They are easier on you than you are yourself. So, but let's assume that you are rather low in conscientiousness. The next question would be, well how young are you? Because younger people tend to be lowered conscientiousness, so if you're like 16, well that's low but it's not catastrophic. If you're like 40 and you're not depressed and zero is, you know that's low anyways.

Speaker 1:          00:56          If you are that low in conscientiousness, one of the things I would recommend is a, make a plan and be learn how to use a schedule a calendar and do it badly to begin with, like electronic calendar, like Google calendar, that's the best thing I know of, to improve conscientious, to make a plan so that you've got something to a mat and um, use a scheduler and maybe you have to, you know, talk to someone to help keep you on track. Now the other question would be, do you have other personality traits that are really high, like openness because if you're really high in openness, then it might be that you're more inclined towards being motivated by spontaneous interest and in the artistic direction. And if you're really high in extroversion, then you're going to be motivated by being around people you know. So it also may be that in order to be conscientious about something, you have to pick a domain that you're suited to like socializing or artistic endeavor and try to work on being conscientious in those domains. So that's it.
