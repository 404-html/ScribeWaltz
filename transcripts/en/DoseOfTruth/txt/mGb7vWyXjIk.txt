Speaker 1:          00:00          You know, another thing that struck me about your book that was quite interesting I thought was that you list the names of a very large number of totally unsung heroes, you know, those are people and we have a very interesting table near the beginning where you list, I think about 10 names, maybe 12 of people who've saved between hundreds of billions and billions of lives with their scientific, with their incremental scientific productivity. And yet those are people that are by no means household names. That's another place where things don't make the news.

Speaker 2:          00:32          Yes, absolutely. And it's a, it's funny how our moral, a crediting our moral, our awarding of World Brownie points doesn't quite correlate with how much good people often doesn't at all correlate. And the case of the inventors of synthetic fertilizer, of vaccines, of chlorination, of public water, supplies of the green revolution in agriculture are, are pretty much unknown. And they literally say billions of lives a. whereas various reformers and, and, uh, uh, profits and agitators are a pretty well known. A number of, uh, uh, certainly people who are painted by the Roman Catholic Church who have to perform a miracle that might resolve resulted saving one life, of course in fact did not because miracles don't happen, but the fact that that definition of saint has nothing to do with saving lives on scales of millions or billions to shows like human moral sense is not really well calibrated to morality as we would have defended myself.

Speaker 1:          01:42          I think it was stolen who said something like a single death is a tragedy, but a million deaths is a statistic. Maybe didn't say it, but, uh, but it's, it's a conventionally attributed to him. So let's say for good reason. I mean, I suppose I could have said it to or I guess maybe the same thing plays in reverse say, is that the saving of a single life has a narrative punch and the incremental savings of 100 million lives, especially through prevention. That's another problem, right? Because prevention isn't dramatic because the terrible thing merely doesn't happen.

Speaker 2:          02:19          And that's, um, I, I rather cheekily wrote an article on the human moral sense that began with a, who do you, who do you think is most a morally Praiseworthy Mother Teresa or Bill Gates or Norman Borlaug. And this was before a gates is pivot from a computer technology to philanthropy was, was well known. It was about 10 years ago. And I set it up as a bit of a trick question because of course everyone would say mother Teresa, even in our field and in discussions with moral psychology, whenever a speaker has to pull out of the air and example of a particularly moral person, Mother Teresa is the stereotype. Even though if you ask people, well, what did she accomplish? Uh, how many lives did she save? How many sick people did she actually cure? A, it's very hard to come up with, for actual accomplishment. What does Bill Gates has already been credited with saving perhaps $100 million lives through his efforts to eliminate affection, infectious disease living world. And Norman Borlaug won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1970 for his role in a fermenting. The green revolution probably saved a billion lives, selective breeding of hybrid crops that required less fertilizer that could be grown twice a year, less water, higher yields, less susceptibility to disease, which countries like Mexico and India from a from basket cases to exporters of food in, in, in less than a decade.

Speaker 1:          03:47          Right. Do you think that would be a story that everyone in in elementary and junior high school would learn because it's such a remarkable. It's an absolutely remarkable story and no one. I mean, I don't know what percentage of people would know his name, his name, but I don't imagine it's. It's. I suspect it's in the low percentages if that.

Speaker 2:          04:07          I, I, I'm sure that's right. I think there may have been a change. I seem to recall a, although I hate to begin any sentence with when I was young a day, but we, we did read heroic biographies of Medical Pioneers like annotating the discover of sewage and that Thomas Edison, and I don't know if that kind of a heroic biography of the innovator of the inventor a scientist is as common at children's education.

Speaker 1:          04:38          Yeah, I suspect, I strongly suspect not. It certainly wouldn't be in Canada given the tilt that our education system has taken.
