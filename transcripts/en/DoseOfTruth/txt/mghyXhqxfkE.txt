Speaker 1:          00:00          You're going to be resentful and bitter in many situations because you don't get what you want and if you watch that resentment, bitterness, clc, that it produces fantasies that can be unbelievably dark and that can be very frightening and you might not want to admit to yourself that you're actually capable of having fantasies like that or impulses of like that or aggressive feelings like that. But the thing is is that if those aggressive feelings and impulses and fantasies are integrated into your character, it's like you're opening up a dialogue with a part of yourself that can be very forceful and strong and dangerous, and it's really useful to be dangerous because if you can, if you can be dangerous, you often don't have to be, and it's often weak. People, for example, it's weak men generally speaking, who rape. You know that that's a very, very common occurrence and that's a violent act, but it's born out of weakness, not out of strength.

Speaker 1:          00:51          That's for sure. And so anyways, you attend to your resentment honestly, and you observe yourself and what you're actually like. You got to pay attention as if you don't know yourself as if you might harbor hidden devils and then maybe they'll emerge. Now. Young also felt that sort of embedded inside the shower where the contra sexual tendencies and so for example, sometimes you see people who are well developed men let's say, and we can. We can also talk about women in this regard. Men who've integrated their shadow often also develop a kind of peculiar grace that would be a consequence of not only allowing their aggressive side to step forward, but also their feminine in Compassionate side that might, that they may have kept squelched because of embarrassment about it or because they'd been harassed for being weak or any number of things so, but the practical approach for developing your shadow, I would say is to contemplate and consider your resentment and notice what it says and because your resentment will also tell you what you have to say.

Speaker 1:          01:50          You know, so look, look at what happened at Google this weekend. You know, James Damore wrote that memo and you can imagine he was pretty angry and perhaps even somewhat resentful at having to attend that diversity seminar, and I'm really just using this as an example, but what he did was decide that that meant that he had something that he had to say and then look at the consequences of that. Man. It's an absolutely unbelievable and so you know, if you're feeling oppressed at work or you're oppressed in your life or or you know where you're expressing yourself, then you got to notice that you're feeling oppressed. Then you have to notice that you're feeling resentful, resentful, and angry and bitter and maybe even like Cain in the story of Cain and Abel because Cain is sort of the archetype of bitter man. And then you have to decide what it is that you need to do in order to remove from yourself that bitterness.

Speaker 1:          02:37          And that's usually means that there's something that you have to say and then you have to say it because you're soul depends on it. And not only does your soul depend on it. I would say the fate of the world depends on it because you know you might be wrong and then you should be straightened out. Maybe you're just being windy and you have to talk to somebody about that, but it may be that you're actually detecting something wrong. Some tyranny that's directed towards you and other people, and it's like your moral obligation to speak up about it.
