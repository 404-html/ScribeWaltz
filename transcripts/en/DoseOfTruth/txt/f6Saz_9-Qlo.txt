Speaker 1:          00:06          The idea about having a coat of many colors would be that the person who is the appropriate leader because we met, or the proper person, which would be the same thing. One of the things that these old stories are trying to express and to figure out is how is it that you should act, which is the same as what constitutes the ideal. Those are the same questions and the hand here with Joseph is while you should wear a coat of many colors, which means that you should be able to go have a drink in the pub with the guys who were, you know, dry walling year your house and you should be able to have a sophisticated conversation with someone who's more educated in an abstract way and that maybe you should be equally comfortable in both situations, right? Because you might think, well there's more.

Speaker 1:          00:54          One of the indications that there's more to you is that you can be put more places and function properly. And that would be a good thing to aim at. Because here's the other issue is that you know perfectly well that the fundamental tragedies of life and your exposure to malevolence in the course of that life. So those being the worst things, there's not a lot you can do to alter that fundamentally because their conditions of existence, you're going to be subject to your vulnerability and your going to be subject to malevolence. That's that. And you can't hide from it cause it actually makes it worse. So you're stuck with it. So then the question is, well, what are your options? And one option is to curse the structure of being for being malevolent and tragic and fair enough. And now there is to make yourself so damn differentiated and Dynamic and Abel that you're more than a match for that. Now that's not an easy thing, but it doesn't matter because what's the alternative? There's no good alternative. And that's also worth knowing.
