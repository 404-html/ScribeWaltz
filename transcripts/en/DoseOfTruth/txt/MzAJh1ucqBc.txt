Speaker 1:          00:08          Anyways, back to the Hypothalamus, roughly speaking, and I'm no expert on hypothalamic function and I had to pound by way through Swanson's paper because it's quite complex, but the hypothalamus is sort of the nexus between the brain, the mind and the body. That's one way of thinking about it and it's very good at monitoring your body, the states of your body and it can figure out basically when your blood sugar's too low and when you need water and when you don't. Exactly remember how it's, uh, associated with the regulation of breathing because I suspect that that's a different system and I don't remember that being a subcomponent of the hypothalamus, but it does also regulate things like sexual behavior and sex, sexual attraction and temperature regulation and excretion and, and you know, all the things that you would associate with the basic biological functions that come along with being a complex animal.

Speaker 1:          01:01          And you know, we share those functions way down the evolutionary chain. You know, we share a lot of the functions with everything that moves, approach and avoidance. We share with pretty much everything that moves. And by the time you get to the higher mammalian functions, you know, we share those with pretty much all mammals. That's partly why we can understand mammals pretty well. You know, once you can kind of have a lizard as a pet and some of them are more social than others, but you know, to really have a pad, it has to be a mammal and it's even better if it's a social mammal like a, like a dog because you know, you can understand dogs and they can understand you because they are hierarchical animals and they have the same roughly the same set of biological functions that you do. You know, their brains are organized around smell and not around vision. And almost all animals are like that except for people. And maybe hunting birds, you know. So that's one thing that really distinguishes us from dogs, but we're similar enough in neuron body behavior so that we can directly relate to dogs. And you know, they can even play.
