Speaker 1:          00:06          So let's, let's look at that user interface idea. Obviously what happens when you're looking at a computer screen is that the complexity of the screen is reduced to a set of icons that can serve as tools. And I think that that's a reasonable way of thinking about how we look at the world

Speaker 2:          00:23          flex in it, in that Hoffman's theory is that natural selection didn't select our brains to, to record an accurate representation of reality. Like the scientific model we'll attempts to get ever closer to what reality is really light. No natural selection just wants us to escape predators. It doesn't matter what they look like, what the icon is in your brain of breaths, that's brain or whatever, as long as you survive, that's all that matters. So, uh, this is why we're so easily deceived by illusions and magic tricks and things like that, that, you know, our brains aren't really wired to, to represent reality as it really is. Whatever that means. And, um,

Speaker 1:          00:57          yes, I can say that without human consciousness, the iconic reality that we inhabit would not exist.

Speaker 2:          01:04          Right. Okay. Did that slightly is that, um, is I told them so let's say, uh, you know, what's it like to be a dolphin? I don't know. Okay. So some kind of echolocation system. So, and his point is, well there, you know, the sharks are dangerous, so, uh, his, they avoid charts. But the question is what does a shark look like in Dalton's brain versus what it looks like in our brain? It's probably quite different and I really have no idea what a shark looks like two adults, but I do know this, they're really our shirts and they really have sharp things on one end and a tail on the other and they're eating machines and you should avoid them. So yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:42          that's actually a weakness of the icon claim I would say, because it looks to me like here, here's the twist on it. What we see in our conscious experience are functional icons, but they're also low resolution representations of the things that are actually there. And, and I don't think that computer icons are low resolution representations of the things that are there. They're just functional icons. Now. I might be wrong about that because, because it's hard to to conjure up that analysis on the fly. But the Trashcan, for example, on your desktop is actually, it's actually a low resolution representations of an actual trashcan, not a computer trashcan, even though it functions the same way. Right. So, so I think I liked the icon idea, but I think it misses some element of the actual relationship between the perception and the reality. We definitely see in low resolution, which is why we can stand animated pictures like say the Simpsons, you know, where, where everything is one extremely low resolution, but that makes no functional difference to us whatsoever.

Speaker 1:          02:50          And we definitely see and hear in low resolution, but the resolution like I think what we see or something like instead of icons, they're more like thumbnails that are functional. That's a good analogy. Well, I like it because the thumbnail, the thumbnail actually is an unbiased sampling of the actual object, right? Because a photograph is relatively unbiased sample of an object and you can compress it. You can, you can, you can until it, and what you're doing is blurring out distinctions between, you're blurring out distinctions between different aspects of it without, without losing the relationship between the parts. It's something like that.

Speaker 2:          03:32          Yeah, that's right. Yeah. In a way, much of science operates at a metaphorical level, you know, that string, you know, have you ever seen a string theory documentary that didn't have violins featured in it? You know, that, that the computer, the brain is like a computer. It's like a dual processor. Yeah. Because we have to talk and we have to transfer the literal meaning of metaphors to move something from here to there in the original Greek. So, you know, we tried to capture some idea that's really hard to get that buy something we're very familiar with. So.
