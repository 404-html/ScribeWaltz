Speaker 1:          00:06          Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:09          believe some other things. This is where I think he gets a little bit optimistic, but Rogers is one of those optimists you really have to contend with. Now he believed, and I think this is a classical Protestant belief, this as well, that what evil was was basically the absence of good and that people had a strong intrinsic impulse towards the good that you could help them realize and the way you help them realize. That was by setting the preconditions for the emergence of that good and he believed that the preconditions were the provision of a space for communication where there was no judgment in the sense of rejection. And so here's the Rogerian theory with regards to therapeutic endeavor.

Speaker 2:          01:14          Now the first thing is, and this seems critical and I think Rogers was right about this, that the client has to want to change, and this is. This is a funny thing about therapy because my observation has been that it's not something you can impose on people unless they've decided that things could be better and that alterations in, in, in something they're doing might make it better. It's a nonstarter. And so I've had clients who were court ordered to attend therapy and that's just complete waste of time, especially if they're more on the psychopath, that gift of things because you're just, if they don't want to change, they're not going to learn. And this is actually another Rogerian principle and because Roger's had an educational philosophy as well and the educational philosophy was students will not learn things that are not relevant to them. And so one of the teachers duties was to make the material at hand relevant because that would help the students remember it.

Speaker 2:          02:17          Why remembered if it's not relevant to. One of the things I tried to do in my lectures, I try to tell people when I'm lecturing, why they should know this. And the fundamental answer always, if you push it down far enough, is that if you know this, your life will go better and so will the life of people around you. So you should listen. Because then there's some things that are sharp and pointy that you will run into while you're wandering around in the fall. So, and, and that's the fundamental issue. It's, it's necessary to know these things and so if you're dealing with someone who hasn't decided that there's something wrong and that they have something to do about it, then maybe they could change that would make things better. You're not going anywhere, and Rogers would also say that's actually a precondition for a relationship period because he didn't really make much of a distinction between a therapeutic relationship and a genuine relationship because he thought the genuine relationships with therapeutic and so one of the principles that you can extract from that is that if you're in a relationship, one useful proposition is that, well, you're pretty perfect, but you're probably not quite as perfect as you could be.

Speaker 2:          03:25          And so it's possible that your partner, no matter how deeply flawed they are, might now and then have something to say to you that would, if you incorporated, would bring you to an even higher state of perfection. Right? And so that's, that means you have to listen. And it's worse than that. And this again is a Rogerian observation. You might have to help them criticize you because maybe they're not very good at it. You know, and so there's something they're trying to tell you and they're stumbling way and it's, it's an actual thing, but they can't articulate it and so it'd be easy for you just to, especially if you're trying to use language instrumentally and to get away with it just to, while you could even make fun of the way they're poorly articulating the problem, that's a really good one because then you can convince them not to do such things in the future.

Speaker 2:          04:15          But if you take the other stance, which is, well, I've got some things to learn and you've got some things to learn and you've got some things to teach me and I've got some things to teach you and God only knows when that's gonna happen, but it might happen. So the object of the conversation is for each person to help the other person make their point. You know? And that's a lot different than winning the argument. And I can tell you one thing, you will not win an argument with any intimate partner ever because you're not playing the game of the argument. You're playing the game of iterated arguments across time and so if you win an argument, you just set up another one winning and solving the problem and the same thing, so from a Rogerian perspective, winning would be the maintenance of your current self structure at the cost of failure to integrate some disintegrated element of the phenomenological realm.

Speaker 2:          05:06          Maybe it'd be the unhappiness of your partner. That might be one of them. Now you can. If you win the argument, that's the rationalization issue. Fundamentally you don't have to change, but the fact is you do have to change because the way you are is giving rise to this situation and that's not going to change unless you fix it. So winning an argument and fixing something. Those are completely different things. You fix the thing. It goes away and often couples have to have conflict because there's no difference between conflict and thinking. Thinking is a form of Lore. It's just that you, you, you make it an interior form of war, right? You can't have accomplished without conflict because life is different, difficult and people differ from one another. So they have different value structures and so you can't just ignore that you have to set up a dialogue because it's not necessarily obvious clues, right?

Speaker 2:          05:58          Of course rogers bleed that in the therapeutic round two. So he thought if therapy is something that emerged as a consequence of the adoption of certain axiomatic presuppositions and those were things could be better than they are and you could make them that way and that's also true for me. And then the next presumption is, well maybe we can figure out how to do that in a collaborative with collaborative communication. So Rogers believed that the therapist was just as transformed during the therapeutic process as the person. In fact, if that wasn't happening then whatever was happening wasn't the kind of healing therapy that Rogers would like to have happen. And he also said that's all. I'll read you something he said later, but he also pointed out quite strongly that that's why people don't really like to listen. You know, like maybe there's some flaw in yourself.

Speaker 2:          06:51          Structure at some fundamental level, fundamentally axiomatic level, you know, maybe you're narcissistic. That'd be a good one. And you know, if you listen to people, they're going to tell you you're narcissistic. Well, you don't want to find that out because it's going to blow a huge hole and you're gonna blow a huge hole in yourself. Structure that's not very fun. But hypothetically, that beats running into the obstacles that you will run into if you're narcissistic repeatedly as you move forward through life. So you can either live with your flaws are correct. And then the, the pathway to correction is dialogue, communication.
