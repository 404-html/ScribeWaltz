Speaker 1:          00:06          Well, when you delve into the literature on Judaism, Christianity and Islam and their versions of the afterlife and heaven, they're quite different in the Jews are far less obsessed with going some place after death. In fact, originally they had. They were going no place at all. Shell was just nothing. It was just. He returned to where you were before. You're allowed just no place, uh, and so, so that, that religion is far more focused on the here and now. Like we have a moral duty to help people, the poor and so on now and to live better lives and more lives of dignity and honor and let now and at Christianity really started off more like that. Then kind of morphed over the centuries and it particularly in fundamentalist and evangelicals in the 20th century toward this place. We're going to go right now. Yeah. You kind of had the schism in Christianity today between the kind of the, the fundamentalists that are constantly talking about the afterlife and accepting Jesus and they're focused on missionary, working into birding people versus say maybe the Rick Warren's of the world that want to put their money into a soup kitchens and helping the poor and, and, and, and Christians have a moral duty to help those in need and not so much focused on the next life.

Speaker 1:          01:24          And yeah,

Speaker 2:          01:25          it's funny because there, there are real dangers associated with both those kinds of conceptualizations mean you alluded to one danger that was associated with, let's call those who are concerned more with the immediate present. And that's the starting to manifest itself in these, in these, um, technological immortalists. They're saying, well, we should transform the nature of being extraordinarily radically right here and now so that we have heaven in immortality here. You think, well, what do we lose by doing that? You know, that's the question that's really worth asking because if we're transhuman then we lose being human. And it may be that we actually don't want to lose being human. Even though being human means suffering and malevolent, something like that, it's a very hard question, but then the Christians, this is what we need. She went after the Christian. Since it's such an ax. He said, well, if you despise the current world and you leave everything to be rectified in the afterlife, then you just abandoned life itself and you're really trainers to life. How, how to steer through those to shoot two shows, let's say is thing or to cliff's. That's a very difficult proposition.

Speaker 1:          02:35          Well, it's the message. My message in the book to, to the military eons and the cryonics and transhumanism and so on is I'm glad you're working on this problem. You know, but because I say to Schermer don't you want to live to be a thousand years and my response is look, just get me the 90 without cancer and 100 without Alzheimer's and 110 without being plugged into machines and lying in a. because that's not alive. And so I'm glad people are working on like, what's the best diet, how much? What can we do to improve our memory? And so on. That's all. Great, and I'm glad and I'm glad Kurzweil is now the chief engineer of all Google. I mean he's got some resources to do something about this, but that this focus on living a thousand years, your first one you may miss the little incremental things we can do, but also you're missing out now.

Speaker 1:          03:29          There's this fell in my right about, in the book I'm on Ray Kurzweil. It's a little kind of biographical film of him, a transcendent man and he's constantly talking about, you know, living forever and so on and he's obsessed with his father. His father died when he was 51. The father was 51 and, and ray was kind of missed out having a father figure because the father was always working and ray was a, you know, a, a real entrepreneur achiever from his teenage years. So he was always working and the film kind of follows him around collecting everything he can about his father and he keeps it in the basement of his house and he wants to resurrect his father and a computer and it's like, Whoa, boy. Freud would have a field day with this Indian guy, but there's something, there's something going on there. This sort of rose, you know,

Speaker 2:          04:16          I see this, this strange dichotomy and attitude that you just described. Even characterizing use that in my own life because I'm very interested in technologies that stave off aging, dietary manipulations, and I have this machine in my basement that's intense pulse light, late intense pulse light machine that's unbelievable skin rejuvenator. It's an absolute miracle. This machine. And it'll take, it'll take sun damage from your skin completely. And forced rejuvenation. It's like, it's just like using photoshop on your skin. It's amazing. And, but, um, but, and so I think, well, isn't it interesting to do everything possible to prolong youth in life? But at the same time there's another part of me that's thinking, well, this is something I wrote about it in this new book that I'm publishing. I'm just thinking about socrates and his ability to accept his death. No. And what socrates seems to have revealed in his acceptance of his death was that if you live your life properly, then you may be.

Speaker 2:          05:24          You lived your life in some sense, you've exhausted it in some sense. The question is if you, if you lived a thousand years, well, what exactly, what exactly would you do? You know, like I've had kids and I loved having kids, but I wouldn't have them again. Like I wouldn't do that again, I don't think. And I have a grandchild and that's fine, but that's a new thing. Like I've had a career and I as I get older, the idea of having 10 more careers seems. It's not like I'm not interested in it, but it doesn't grip me the same way that it would have say 20 years ago. And so I wonder like I wonder if it is the case that life is in some sense structured so that its finitude as necessary and not something that should be well casually transcended. Let's say.
