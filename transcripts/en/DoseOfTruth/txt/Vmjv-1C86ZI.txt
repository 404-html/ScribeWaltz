Speaker 1:          00:08          One more. Daniel, shall I like this question? How would you give a speech to soldiers entering the army about responsibility? I will command and basic training unit and address young soldiers advice. Daniel, what I would do is you can take about this, you could ask them to complete the future authoring program. I think that would be a really good idea. But if you don't want to do that, but you should ask them to like get them to sit down for 90 minutes or an hour even. I would use the future authoring program cause it's just easier. But ask them what sort of soldiers they want to be in three to five years. Like if they could put themselves together and be the best military and serve the purpose that they enrolled in the military for in the best possible manner, what would they look like as their own future ideal?

Speaker 1:          00:55          They have to think it through. So, and then the other thing you can ask them, and this is also part of the future authoring program, is like what would your life look like three to five years down the road? If you fail in your, in your desire to, to become a proper soldier, what sort of hell are you cording by failing to take on the responsibility. And if you can get them to think that through, you know, the probability that they'll do a good job, we'll fastly increase, really vastly increase. Lots of young people have never thought about who it is that they could be if they started to be the person they could be. And so getting them to think about that and write about it would be extremely important. So what I would do first of all is get them to do the writing and the thinking and then give the speech. And maybe once they've done it, you know, you could ask them if they'd be willing to share with you some of what they've written. I wouldn't make that mandatory because then they might not be able to write about it honestly. So that's how I would go about it.
