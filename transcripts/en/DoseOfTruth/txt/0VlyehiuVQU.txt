Speaker 1:          00:07          Your idea of realer than real appears to parallel Plato's theory of the forms? Is this the source of the idea or are you reconsidering ancient philosophy? Well, God only knows what the source of an idea is, you know, um, uh, my sense of Plato's forms was it was that they weren't exactly narrative instructure although I think that, I think that there isn't at least an analogous relationship between the idea of archetype and the idea of form. Um, I think Plato was talking more about forms of, of tangible objects in the world. You know, where I'm talking more about permanent patterns of behavior, you know, because,

Speaker 2:          00:53          okay,

Speaker 1:          00:54          what are, what our culture is essentially is a dance of permanent patterns of behavior. I mean, there's a fair bit of variability in the, in the patterns. Like there is variability in a basketball game or a soccer game or something like that. You know, there's obviously predictability and variability, but, um, what's the predictable elements are the, are equivalent in some sense to the platonic forms, which is the point that you're making and it's the discovery of those more permanent forms that emerges. As a consequence of the spinning of stories, you know, because we're watching each other constantly and we're articulating what we see and then we're amalgamating the articulations and we're sifting them for, for fundamental patterns. Like a good example of that. It's something I just recently discovered when I did the biblical lectures on Abraham. You know, I, I didn't understand that Abraham was a late bloomer.

Speaker 1:          01:52          You know, he was like the guy who stayed in his mother's basement for too long. I mean, he's 75 when God calls him on an adventure and God basically tells him to leave his family and his countrymen and his kinsmen and to go into the land of the stranger. And that's, see there's an archetypal pattern there. And the pattern is, while it's the pattern of the call and it's, it's deeply, it's something that people experience, you know, like an adolescent, a healthy adolescent wants to get away from his or her stultifying, uh, um, dependent upbringing and go out into the world of adventure, you know, in, in the biblical stories, thoughts that's symbolically represented as something akin to a divine call, which, which I think is quite interesting because, you know, we don't understand these calls. You know, you have an impulse to do something, something captures your interest, something captures your motivation.

Speaker 1:          02:53          It's, it's not like it's self-generated. Exactly. You know, the, the, that the call to adventure is produced by something like a transcendent deity is a really interesting idea. Now. It depends on what you mean by, I didn't know you could think about it as an ancient brain circuit, I suppose. Although I don't know if that really makes it things any clearer. But there is an impulse within people that pulls them out into the world to go away from their safe circumstances and to make their fortunate where there's famine and tyranny and, and threats to the integrity of the family, which are all things that Abraham immediately encounters when he listens to God. And so that seems to be something like something that's realer than real because everyone experiences that to some degree or everyone can relate to it. It's a deep, deep theme. And you know, what I'm looking for in the biblical stories, in other mythological representations is these deep universal themes. Now is that a reconceptualization of ancient philosophy? It's really hard to say because, you know, I derived the idea of the archetype, at least in part from reading young and young of course, was influenced because he had a great classical education by the ancients. And so exactly where these ideas come from isn't clear. So, um, so I guess that's pretty much all I, all I have to say about that.
