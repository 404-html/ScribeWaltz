Speaker 1:          00:00          It isn't that the only that, because if you're healthy and energetic, you're much more likely to be successful because it's very hard to be successful if you're ill obviously. I mean so because the competition is just too high. And both, both genders, both sexes select each other for attractiveness, both select for intelligence, both at select for personality, although the different, there are differences there in terms of what's what stressed. But so, so, so I think you can derive a couple of things out of out of this. And this is where I think people are different than, than other animals. Importantly different is that, so you imagine that there's tremendous selection pressure to, uh, towards the production, let's say of men who are good at climbing male dominance hierarchies or are climbing the male dominance hierarchy. But the thing that's so interesting about people is that we've multiplied our dominance hierarchies.

Speaker 1:          00:51          You know, if you take an animal that's got a rather static behavioral pattern, then there's, there's a single hierarchy. Elephant seals are a good example of that. So elephant seals, the males are absolutely massive. They're way, way bigger than the females. And they basically have harems roughly speaking, and they use physical prowess as their marker of status essentially. And obviously size is a huge part of that because otherwise the male elephant seals wouldn't be as, they're massive. These things are absolutely enormous. And so it's just power slash health, you know, maybe aggression, something like that. It's whatever makes them more um, suitable for the kind of physical combat that elephant seals engage it. So, and the degree to which power is associated with dominance status in those sorts of situations seems to be associated with the size differential between males and females. So the more power is an issue with regards to male competence, the larger the bales are compared to the females and the more likely the males are going to have a harem relationship with the females.

Speaker 1:          01:57          And you see that a little bit in human beings because men are bigger than women. They're not overwhelmingly bigger. That's sexual dimorphism. And you know, there's some men that are smaller than some women, but on average men are tolerant there. They have more upper body strength and so forth. So there is a power element to male competition, but it's not as extended as it would be among animals. Say like, like elephant seals. So in the elephant seal you see maybe there's one stable set of traits that's being selected for that makes the males more likely to reproduce. But human beings, we're very weird creatures because we're so conceptually flexible. And so what seems to have happened, maybe we started males started selecting each other for don in dominance competitions for something like cognitive flexibility and conscientiousness. It's something like that. So that would be the ability to abstractly represent the world and then the ability to operate effectively within it, to represent yourself socially in a way.

Speaker 1:          02:54          And then to carry through with that because that enables people to trust you. So it's something like, and so that produced cortical expansion and then women were selecting men who are good at that, in that produce cortical expansion. And then there's an arms race between women and men with regards to intelligence. So the women kept up or they certainly kept up with, with, with intelligence as, as the evolutionary cycle continued. But one of the consequences of selection for cortical expansion and increased cognitive flexibility was that the number of dominance hierarchies that human beings could produce started to multiply, right? Because there's all sorts of ways that you can be successful. There's you think about how many ways you can be successful in a modern culture and and you can be successful in dimensions that aren't really even associated with each other. So you can be successful socially that that's what an extrovert would do.

Speaker 1:          03:49          You could be successful in terms of intimate relationships. That's what a agreeable person would do. A disagreeable person would be more successful with regards to competition. A person who's high in neuroticism would be, would be tried to protect themselves and to establish some sort of security and open person would be looking for a flexible creative environment. And so there's this multiplicity of, of ways that you can establish a dominance hierarchy and be successful in it. And if you're creative, you can come up with your own damn dominance hierarchy, which is exactly what you're doing. If you're creative, right? You, you spin up a game that's your game and then you, you make the rules. And that's hard because if you make a new game with new rule, if it's hard to monetize it, but you can be the best at playing that game. And so that's a huge advantage to being creative if you can pull it off.

Speaker 1:          04:36          So then you think, well, what's happened among human beings is the multiplication of the set of possible dominance hierarchies. So it's become very broad. And then you could say, well, what's, what's driving selection now is the ability to be successful across multiple sets of dominance, hierarchies. And that accounts, at least in part for our cognitive flexibility. And so that's really what a human being is. A human being is a creature that has high potential for succeeding across a very wide range of potential human dominance hierarchies. And so that gives us our transformative psyche. That's the niche that, that's the niche that we've both produced and occupy. And I think it's out of that, that hero mythology emerges fundamentally because I think what the hero is, the mythological hero is a representation of that part of the psyche that's particularly good at being successful across sets of dominance hierarchies.

Speaker 1:          05:27          It's a very, very biological way of thinking about it. And I thought about this for a long time. I can't see any way that that just can't be the case. And how else, how else could it work if we had a fixed behavioral pattern like beavers, you know you're the most successful beaver. If you build the best damn, it's like fine. Then you know what's going to be selected for it. But that isn't what people are like and it's also why we're so multipurpose. You know we have hands. What's a hand for? What's the evolutionary of a hand? Well you, you can't specify that. You could say it's something like, well the hand is useful for doing a whole bunch of different things with well and mouth. Tongue, same thing. What are words for while it's the same thing, therefore very there for communicating a very wide range of information.

Speaker 1:          06:15          It's something like that. So were were these weird general purpose animals, you know, we're not great at any one thing, but we can swim better than most terrestrial animals. You know, we can run faster than most animals and we could certainly run longer. Like a human being can run a horse to death over the course of a week if they're in good shape. So like, we're really good at being multipurpose entity, like a rat, you know, were they call rats, weedy species because they can be anywhere. They don't have a specific niche. Like, you know, there's animals down in, in, uh, the Amazon that are specialized for like one tree, you know, or one type of tree in one tiny little area. That's not what human beings like is, were we're like, cockroaches are rats, which is nasty comparison, but we can go anywhere and thrive. And so, and so being particularly good at that, being particularly good at being able to go anywhere and thrive also seems to me to be a canonical element of the hero mythology. So, so, okay. All right. Now.
