Speaker 1:          00:07          David Jackson. What are your thoughts on Sophia citizenship status? That's the robot. I believe that the Saudi, the Saudi Arabians made into a citizen here. I've got a thought. Wouldn't it be nice if the Saudis actually let their women be citizens? That's what I, that's my thoughts. So I don't think that the rest of the world is in any position to take any lessons on what whatsoever, on what constitutes citizenship from the Saudis. That's my feeling about that. I'm not, I'm not a fan of Saudi Arabian culture. I'm not a fan of the way that they treat their women. I'm not a fan of the way that they disseminate Wahhabi propaganda into the west. I'm not a fan of the way that they, they despise work. And, and I'm not a fan of the Saudi Arabians and the fact that they, granted Sophia citizenship status is a publicity stunt of the worst form as far as I'm concerned. So.
