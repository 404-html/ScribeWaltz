Speaker 1:          00:02          I also spent a lot of time reading Carl Young and it was through [inaudible] and also John Piaget who was a developmental psychologist that I started to understand that are articulated systems of thought are embedded in something like a dream. And that dream is informed in a complex way by the way we act. So you know, we act out things we don't understand all the time. And if that wasn't the case, then we wouldn't need a psychology or a sociology and anthropology or any of that because we would be completely transparent to ourselves. And we're clearly not. So we're much more complicated than we understand, which means that the way that we behave contains way more information than we know. And part of the dream that surrounds our articulated know of his being extracted as a consequence of us watching each other and behave and telling stories about it for thousands and thousands and thousands of years.

Speaker 1:          00:55          Extracting out patterns of behavior that characterize humanity and trying to represent them, pardon me, through imitation, but also through drama and mythology and literature and art and all of that to represent what we're like. So that we can understand what we're like. And that process of understanding is what I see unfolding, at least in part, the biblical stories. And it's, it's halting and partial and awkward and contradictory and, and all of that, which is one of the things that makes the book so complex. But I see in it the struggle of humanity to arise, to rise above its animal forebear say, and to become conscious of what it means to be human. And that's a very difficult thing because we don't know who we are, what we are, where we came from or any of those things. And you know, the light life is an unbroken chain going back three and a half billion years. It's an absolutely unbelievable thing. Every single one of your ancestors reproduce successfully for three and a half billion years. It's absolutely unbelievable. We rose out of the dirt and the Muck, and here we are conscious, but not knowing.
