Speaker 1:          00:07          One of the things that I've been realizing as a consequence of going through these stories is that

Speaker 1:          00:17          the degree to which there are about individuals is quite remarkable and I think that's really telling, you know, one of the reasons I prefer Dostoyevsky Tolstoy because Tolstoy is more of a sociologist. He's more interested in the relationship between groups of people. This is an oversimplification because obviously Tolstoy, he's a great author, but yeah, I like Dostoyevsky better because he really delves into the souls of individuals and I think it's remarkable the degree to which all of the stories that we've covered so far in genesis are about individuals and they're quite realistic, which is quite remarkable too. They're not really romanticize to any great degree because all of the people that are regardless, regardless, let's say as patriarchal or matriarchal figures in genesis have no shortage of ethical, different, no shortage of ethical flaws and also no shortage of difficulties in their life and the difficulties are realistic there.

Speaker 1:          01:15          They're major league problems, you know, like familial catastrophes and famine and war and revenge and hatred and all those things. It's not a, it's not a pretty, it's not a pretty book and that's one of the things that makes it great. I mean that's one of the things that characterize this great literature right, is that it, it doesn't present you with a whitewashed view of, of, of humanity or of existence. And that's really a relief I think, because as you all know, because you're alive, there's no such thing as a whitewash existence like your to be alive is to be in trouble ethically and existentially.

Speaker 1:          01:56          I've been reading this book recently, I'll talk about it a little bit later. It's called better never to have been. And it was written by a philosopher in South Africa in Cape Town named Ben Atar, that's his last name. And he basically argues, I think it's a specious argument and I think it's artificially constructed, but he basically argues that because life is so full of suffering, even good lives are very much full of suffering. That it's wrong to bring children into the world because the suffering outweighs the good even in good lives. And it's actually wrong. It would also be better not to exist for exactly the same reason. And my sense in reading the book is that he came to that conclusion and then wrote the book to justify it, which is actually the reverse of the way that you should write a book. What you should do when you're writing a book is you should have a question and you should, it should be a real question, right?

Speaker 1:          02:55          It should be one you don't know the answer to. And then you should be studying and writing like mad and reading everything you can get your hands on to see if you can actually grapple with the problem and come to some solution and you should walk the reader as well through your process of thinking so that they can come to the, well, not necessary to the same conclusion, but it at least track what you're doing. And I don't think that's what he did. I think he wrote it backwards, but then an a and so I was thinking about it a lot because that's actually a question that I've contended with in my writing. There are Memphis to Ophelia and are satanic figures, for example, in girth is Faust and also Ivan in the, in the, in the brothers Karamazov who basically make the same case, you know, that existence is so rife with trouble and suffering that it would be better if it didn't exist at all.

Speaker 1:          03:46          And the problem I've had with that, there's a variety of them, but one of the problems I've had with that is what happens if you start to think that way? Because what I've observed is that people who begin to think that way, that isn't where they stop. Like it, they get angry at existence, which is what happened to Cain as we saw in the Cain and Abel Story. And then the next step is to start taking revenge against existence. And that cascades until it's revenge against. While I think the best way of thinking about it as revenge against God for the crime of being, which is I think the deepest sort of hatred that you can entertain. And, and, and when you're in the grip of a really deep emotion, like a really profound emotion, right at the bottom of emotions, you're in something that's like a quasi religious state.

Speaker 1:          04:30          And that's more or less independent of your belief, say in a transcendent deity. I mean, you can be in a profoundly emotional state that's as deep as it can be and it can have religious significance without that necessarily signifying anything about a transcendent be it, you know, but, but then I was thinking, you see, the problem with that argument is you can gerrymander it endlessly. You know, because first of all, how do you measure suffering and how do you measure happiness? It's like how do you assign weights to them? And God, there's just no way of doing that. You have to do it arbitrarily. And so you can make an argument that the suffering outweighs the happiness. You just wait the suffering more heavily than you wait the happiness. And that's the end of that, you know? And so that's, that's a problem. But I think there's a deeper problem.
