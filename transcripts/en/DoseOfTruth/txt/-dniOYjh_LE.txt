Speaker 1:          00:07          So Jacob goes back to Israel and he's terrified even though it's been 14 years. He thinks maybe his hotheaded brother hasn't calmed down yet and he has good reason to think that I would say so he sends messengers to Isa who then sets out with 400 men. And so Jacob is not very happy with this whole idea. And he breaks his people into two bands so that maybe half of them cannot be killed. And then he takes from his large flocks a bunch of animals and a bunch of servants and he sends them out to meet. He saw basically to say look I'm I'm a jerk. Sorry about the whole birthright thing. And. And here some animals and you know maybe maybe that's the beginnings of of an apology. It's something like that. And so but he's not very convinced that that's actually going to work.

Speaker 1:          01:01          But he saw who actually turns out to perhaps have matured in the interim. Perhaps that's one way of thinking about it. Meet Jacob and says that just seeing him is enough. But Jacob insists that he takes the gift and so accepts and which is probably a wise thing because even if you saw is ninety five percent convinced that just seeing his brother is enough there's probably five percent of them that still really not all that happy. And so you have to be careful. You know when you say that you forgive someone because there might be a part of you that really doesn't that really need something else before you can actually say OK look fight you know and you don't want to fool yourself about that because that 5 percent that hasn't been completely convinced will find its voice at some point and then maybe undermine the whole reconciliation process.

Speaker 1:          01:55          You don't want to think that you're any better than you are any nicer than you are it's not helpful. And so you saw as smart. I think so while Jacob smart to say no no like thanks a lot but take the damn goats. And Jacob and Esau a smart enough to accept that and he might do that maybe to you know to please Jacob but also I think so that there really is the possibility of establishing peace because hypothetically the gift that's being offered is of sufficient magnitude to erase the debt of the loss of the Birthright. It's something like that right it's it's it's it's the payment of the real debt. And Jesus said what I mean is that by all this drove which I met and Jacob said these are to find grace in the sight of my lord. And he so says I have enough brother Keep thou keep that that thou hast unto thyself and Jacob said this is interesting statement I think no I pray you if I have now found grace in nice sight take the present at my hand for therefore I have seen thy face as though I had seen the face of God and now was pleased with me.

Speaker 1:          03:17          And so that's so he's he's taking the. Honourable judgment of his brother because it is honorable because he saw did get betrayed so he has a right to be standing in judgment and he equates that judgment with with what would you say with the highest of virtues it's appropriate judgment and so he wants to make complete amends to ease so as if he saw as a representative of the divine element of justice and I guess that's convincing to you so it's quite a thing to say. You know that I need to be reconciled to you because that would simultaneously reconcile me with God. It's like it's crucial. This is between us. But it's there's a higher principle at stake that's vital. And I think that is the case with betrayal that's very frequently the case because if you betray someone you really have violated you've deeply violated what can only be called a sacred trust.

Speaker 1:          04:15          It's the right terminology for that. Take it. I pray the my blessing that is brought to the because God has dealt graciously with me and because I have enough and he urged him and he took it so you know this story seems to be something like Well Jacob was kind of an arrogant crooked deceitful character maybe over impressed with his own ability he thought it was pretty amusing to pull. A fast trick or two on his brother. Then he ran off which is not all that brave. And then he got walloped a lot and perhaps learned something. And then when he came back you know he was a different person.

Speaker 2:          04:56          And so that's a that's a reasonable story. And you know he he has to repent completely of about what he did before he can rectify the situation properly and he's willing to do that.

Speaker 1:          05:16          So that's an interesting idea too because it's it's it's an early reflection of the idea that it is if you do something wrong in the past a that you can learn from it. Right. So that you're actually capable of learning and b that you can set the. Balance right in the present. Those are very optimistic ideas you know because you might say well once you've committed some sort of crime that's it there's no hope for you but that's pretty rough because the probability that you've done unethical things at some point in your life is 100 percent. And so if there was no way of setting the balance right after that then everybody would be doomed.
