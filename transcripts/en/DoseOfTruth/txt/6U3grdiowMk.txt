Speaker 1:          00:06          So don't want to be a person is the point of no return. Dr Peterson, when we look at what's happening in the US, I don't think we're at the point of no return. I don't think that things are more fractious than they were in the 19 sixties. You know, there were plenty of riots in the 19 sixties. There was a lot of racial tension, there was a lot of social upheaval. I don't even think we're at that. I don't even think that the level of social upheaval that we're experiencing right now is at that level of magnitude. But I think it is higher than it's been at any point since the 19 sixties. And I think the problem is is that the postmodern radical types have got a stranglehold on the administrative level of many institutions. But I think what they're going to find is that the rug is going to be pulled out from underneath them in ways they don't expect.

Speaker 1:          00:59          So for example, as the press has become, let's say more ideologically oriented, the CBC is a good example of that. I mean, I used to like the CVC, I've been, I was treated more unprofessionally by the CBC, I would say this year. Then by any other media organization that I've been in contact with anywhere in the world which is saying something and multiple times, not just once. And I've never, I mean I'm not complaining about that, I'm just pointing it out. But what's going to happen is that as the media becomes more ideologically committed, it's going to become irrelevant faster and faster. And I think the same thing's gonna happen with the education system, the public education system, and maybe even the universities, the harder they push in the ideological direction, the faster technological transformation we'll pull the rug out from underneath their feet. And I think that could happen.

Speaker 1:          01:55          Like I think that the, the, uh, the classic news media, so to speak, his dad for anyone under 40, certainly for anyone under 30. So. And so that actually. Yeah. Well then you can just see it. If you pay any attention to youtube where you have the rise of people like Joe Rogan who gets a one point $8, million downloads a year and use these long format interviews of three hours where you can go into things in depth, so I'm not. I'm less worried than I was a year ago. I would say because what I've seen happening is that there are many ways that systems can be pulled out from underneath the people who are attempting to manipulate them and I think that there's a diverse enough range of people out there who are smart enough and fast enough on their feet so that the institutions that have become corrupt will just die.

Speaker 1:          02:54          That's what it looks like to me. Now. That doesn't mean that we're not in. For some rocky times. We are the shake out in the public education system is going to be seriously ugly over the next five years when as parents and teachers increasingly wake up to the degree that that they ideological domination has occurred. I guess what worries me is all the hr departments and the direction that they're leaning, and even at our event, some people have brought their syllabus as in just show me they read, always studying and I was reading them. First of all, these syllabuses are pages long A. I remember mine were only like a page long or two and it was just all sorts of things like queer theory and radical black feminist theory and this and that, and when they graduate they're going to be teachers. Yeah. Well the problem with those sorts of approaches is that they're actually not good for anything and so I think that if you're marketing education that doesn't educate, that people will stop buying it a lot faster than you think the universities are still running on there previously established reputation, but they're making so many mistakes right now that I think they're right for, for painful transition.

Speaker 1:          04:11          I mean there's already speculation in the US that thousands of universities and colleges are going to go bankrupt over the next 10 years. Okay.
