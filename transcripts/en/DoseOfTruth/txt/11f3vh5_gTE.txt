Speaker 1:          00:06          That's funny, I was just talking to one of my graduate students, we'd be looking at the determinants of male attractiveness by the personality of female viewers. Okay. And so what we found is that there are some personality affects. So I'm extroverted, enthusiastic women tend to rate men generally speaking as more attractive than introverted, introverted, less enthusiastic women. And um, and so, so there are some just straight personality effects, but the biggest effect by far we found was the proclivity of, of women in general to rape men as less attractive as the women's Iq increased.
