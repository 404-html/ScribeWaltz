Speaker 1:          00:00          Hmm,

Speaker 1:          00:07          roughly 95 percent of the lyrics in pop culture or about mating or there about mating rituals. There are about courtship rituals and you as a person who is white, the meeting has been upgraded by the best and now includes, okay. God knows what it was trying to tell us. So at any rate, um, you have just emerged from childhood, um, your hormones, your sexual hormones and begun to act girls as young as 11 can become pregnant already and you were obsessed with finding your place in the world and finding a mate and courtship rituals mean an awful lot to you there about to what they're there, what you were about to embark on for the next 10 years of your life at least. Um, and so this obsession with courtship rituals with mating and dating and breaking up and, and be trail and all of that kind of stuff makes, makes absolute sense.

Speaker 1:          01:04          Right? Exactly. Well, and the thing is music frames that too because it gives you something that's in common with your potential mate. And it also gives you a set of rather, I wouldn't say stereotyped activities, but at least predictable activities that are associated with courtship and made again, so that would be going to concerts and going to movies which are heavily musically influenced and dancing and, and even discussing your, your shared immersement in whatever that subculture happens to be. Right. And my guess is that at some point music provokes oxytocin because oxytocin is the ultimate bonding hormone and music is a bath in the sense of human belonging in the field. But even if you're alone and you're listening to Pandora or spotify all by yourself, it feeds you social, bread and meat. And in the, in the nervous system, the central nervous system, everything boils down to inhibition or excitation. There is a hormone of excitation and it's glutamate is a hormone of inhibition, and that's the Gaba and oxytocin feeds down into the Gaba system. The system that keeps you calm down. Basically, it gives you a sense of peace.
