Speaker 1:          00:07          I don't know what to do stupid things that you're doing and that's a good start because it starts to clear your, so if you, if you don't know what to do but you do know that you're doing things that maybe regret, you could start by just eliminating it slowly to the basket of your started to become ethical rules. Seven ethical rules with any live long enough, then you'll get this, but we have a clear vision and then you might be received the way forward more. You might see a way forward for more intensity rather than merely what you should avoid. So that's a good initial practical issue is because everyone knows perfectly well that there were things you were doing. You know you shouldn't do it, but you don't stop.

Speaker 1:          01:12          Start stopping because that's part of this idea about putting your house in perfect order before you criticize the world because there's a question. It's always open and that was the question, so to speak, that God placed in front of me is like, well, how do you get on the road? Would be a terrible place. He weren't such a wretched thing. Maybe it wouldn't be. You might say, well, that's very casual answer. What would you say? The people who has a parent who's dying of Alzheimer's disease for example, it's like whether they're going to get their act together and fix that. It's like it would make it a hell of a lot better than it would be. Otherwise. I can tell you that, and that's something because it's nice to have someone who's dead and your family without having a credit of unnecessary pathology. Gather around that and make something that could be nearly tragic into something that sounds right and that happens to people all the time and so even if it's not a perfect solution is the best solution that you have and then the next part that is when I suggest to people that they do the future authoring program and they're.

Speaker 1:          02:18          They're leery about doing it. I asked them to do that because a bad headline is way better than no plan because if you implemented that plan, then you learn why that plan. Exactly. Not Hypothetically, but exactly in the world and then in the news that information above your failure to retool. A better plan and so to be able to manage, if you're tracking a destination that's moving, it's some kind of ideal you, your vision is blurry, you don't know where to look and so you're going to go this way and then you can go this way, but if you keep doing that, then the deviations from the right path to decrease with time and eventually you'll be walking forward in an efficient manner and you might have to be all sorts of errors before you managed that, but I've watched people long enough in my clinical practice to know that waiting for Godot was a very bad idea and not employee.

Speaker 1:          03:16          That is a very bad idea. It's like implementing the best plan to have a camp and learn from her and that works and you get sharper at making your planners and then the other thing that we do in the future authoring program, the school, we asked people, well maybe you can decide what your passion for your calling you should be. That's a pretty global question, but you might ask yourself some questions like, well, is there something you could do to improve your interpretation ship? One thing, is there a way that you can improve your friendships? Is there something you can do at your job that will make it better than it is now? Even if it's something you preventable? Could you do something more productive and meaningful with your time outside of work? Could you be slightly better handling temptations that come your way? Could you take care of yourself?

Speaker 1:          04:11          Something like better mentally and physically and you know the answer is all of those questions is Jennifer. Yes, and then you can even ask yourself a simpler question which would be, oh, if there is something that you could do that would make one of those things married, is there also something that you would do and you can ask yourself that you know instead of telling themselves that you should, which isn't the same thing might say, well, I would like my marriage to be better. You can ask yourself, well, how can my marriage be better? And you'll get a bunch of answers and most of them you will, because if you really ask myself a question like that, the part of their brain that's imagined and it's looking for new answers will tell you and it looks like a bunch of things you don't want to hear at.

Speaker 1:          04:54          A lot of them will be things you already know and some of them will be things that there's just no damn way they'll give you know that you should, but some subset of those might be things that you should do that by your own definition that you actually would do. It might be trivial things in or hooked trivial, but at least they're a step in the right direction. So take whatever step in the right direction. You're willing to take day by day and that's incremental progress and it'll. It'll spiral upward. It does spiral up, or there's a statement in the New Testament, which actually happens to be a true statement, which is to those who have everything more will be given and it's a reflection mind phenomena that looks like phenomenon that looks like a natural laws. As things start to accrue to you, the rate at which they will further approved will increase.

Speaker 1:          05:46          That's a natural logs. Price's law sometimes with the court parade reflect greater distribution, so there's a chapter in 12 rolls, life called don't compare yourself. Compare yourself to who you were yesterday, not to someone else's today, and it's in conjunction for incremental improvement. If you don't know where to go in your life, think about where you are and see if today you could make where are you, are somewhat better on some dimension so that when you go to bed at night, you're not as wretched as you were when you woke up in the morning, and so if you do that for two years, it was one thing a day, just a small thing, something you could actually do that you would do, then your life will be waived it and at the end of that you might have enough clarity of mind to start to understand where you go if things worked out for you properly in the world. So that's the answer. That question.

Speaker 1:          06:43          Thank you. All right. Here's another way that you figure out how to act. Let's say your child and there's a lot you don't know almost everyone, so how do you handle that? Will you stay in a simplified environment, right? You don't crawl out onto the street with your 10 months old. Parents aren't allowed to do that. They keep you in a bounded did and they keep you close to them and what you do is backed up what you know isn't very much most based on things in your mouth and investigate them because that's what kids do at the smiling play, that it's a fragile space of knowledge and it's easily when it's disrupted, you cry and not signal of disruption and then your parents move in with greater knowledge and they fix whatever the problem is and what you do. As you watched that and then you have a job.

Speaker 1:          07:55          It's not like you don't let the rep count because you're not sophisticated enough to know what they're up to. No child childhood give a full account with the behavior of their parents. Know parents will give a full account of her own beginning, so you certainly can't expect that from a child, but children are obviously grow up to take care of their own children, just like image to take care of their own offspring, never knowing what they're doing. Exactly. So you learned about your invitation. Now what that means is that collectively we faced things that we didn't understand for very, very long period of time and we've figured out how to act so that it works out. We don't know. We don't know the rules that underlie that exotic. We don't know exactly what that means. We just figured it out. So there's A. There's a way of being a good father.

Speaker 1:          08:44          Let's say there's a way of being a good mother and mostly you understand what that is. When you fail or when your child accuses you of failing gap, right? Because it's only in the failure, but you realized that you deviate for whatever the ideal is because you're not. Who the hell knows what the rules are for being a good father? It's very difficult to detail though, but you know when you've failed. Okay, so you know how to be a control and you know that because you invitation to your father, he and his father and his father, and it's like way back as far as you can possibly go. That's the goal. We also know that. Here's. Here's an example of why having a clock call colleague at the University of Toronto who spends in maternal behavior in rats raptured actually very sophisticated. They have somewhat of a culture statement pass on through imitative learning. If you take away from.
