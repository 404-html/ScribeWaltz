Speaker 1:          00:07          Have you watched Rick and Morty? No, I haven't. Many people have told me to watch Rick and Morty, although they said it's very dark and well that doesn't bother me so much I suppose. Although I'm plenty dark perhaps without adding too much. So, but um, I would like to watch it and I probably will. So I would love for you to do come and do a talk in Montreal. Well, you never know what that might happen. I've been talking to God side of bolt out a fair bit. You know, he's coming to Toronto November 11th so we can do the talk. That was shut down by Ryerson back in August. So I'm looking forward to that. So

Speaker 1:          00:43          what's the best way to stop drinking alcohol and start doing my best in my psychology degree, it's affecting my study, but I can do very well if I stop. I'm 26. Well, Paul, what I would say is I think you should do the future authoring program and you should really concentrate. There's a section in it that helps you determine what your positive view of your future would be, but another section that helps you determine what would happen in your life if you're negative habits got out of control. And one of the things that can really help you control your alcohol intake is to really, really think through what you're giving up and where you could be in five years if you don't get it under control. And proclivity to alcoholism can be a really vicious thing. You know, lots of people get dragged down into the mud by alcohol excess alcohol intake, especially if they're sensitive to the opiate response that alcohol can produce.

Speaker 1:          01:43          You can tell that if you, when you drink, you know, you get alert and, and, and uh, let's say more enthusiastic and energetic and then you don't want to stop drinking. That's uh, that's definitely a bad sign with regards to developing alcoholism. So I would say you need to figure out something that's, that's more important to you, that drinking and also think through very hard. The negative consequences of continuing it. You're, you're at about the age 26 where you should stop. I mean guys who are going to stop generally start slow down pretty, pretty intensely around that age. Um, you know, get also treating your psychology, studying as a full time job can also be helpful. So, you know, get up at eight in the morning or seven 30 in the morning and start hitting the books by nine and put in a six to eight hour day. And then even if you do keep drinking, at least you're moving forward. So that's what I can say about the APP.

Speaker 1:          02:39          Are you a science fiction fan? You referenced timelines, starship troopers in a lecture, and your ideas often remind me of Harry Selden's plan from Asimov's foundation series. Hey, well, when I was a kid, which is quite a long time ago now, um, I lived in this town called Fairview, Alberta, which was a town of about 3000 people way the hell north 350 miles northwest of Edmonton. And I have this neighbor across the street across the Ellie actually, and he had a huge science fiction library. It must've been, I dunno, 5,000 books there, 1970s, 1960s, 1970s classics, like Heinlein and Asimov. And he would let me go over there and take like 20 books at a time. And I was reading about a book a day at that point. And I read science fiction like mad probably till I was about 19 or so, and maybe a little younger than that and then turn more to classic literature when I got to college. And, and, uh, also partly as a consequence of some lessons that the local library and taught me about what to read. So I was a science fiction fan. Um, I haven't read science fiction for a very long time, although I was pretty happy with it when I was a kid. So.
