Speaker 1:          00:11          You're trying to match matches your weaknesses. The Parker, pretty much everybody knows what those weaknesses are. You know, some people would smoke too much, too much, and some people would be unfaithful and have a comfort productive areas. Some people would end up on the street because they would generate. Everybody kind of knows how they fall apart if they fell apart in their own idiosyncratic and spectacular manner. Those sorts of things that keep you awake at night. If you. If you contemplate them deeply, where would you be interested? Five years. If you let her go directly to hell, that's useful. That's useful because then see it's one thing that want to make yourself because you see them. What you're doing is moving. You have something that you want, but that's whole hope is a powerful emotion, but terror acts and so one of the things out with my clinical clients, it's their baby.

Speaker 1:          01:19          They don't have a job. They really like, you know, and it's grinding away at your soul and just leave your job into another job. That's actually a really complicated problem, right? If you don't like your job, it's not just a psychological problem, have to have a job, otherwise you die. So it's a cycle. And so just changing the battery, just adjusting yourself psychologically. You might be planning to change your job, you have to update your CV and maybe you have to make your skills and we've gotta figure out how to be a little more credit, Melinda, an interview and you have to overcome your fear of rejection. Like there may be all sorts of things that African set yourself up to move laterally or let's say to a different position when it's more engaging and uh, you know, you might be, you might be willing to do that.

Speaker 1:          02:10          Um, and so you were afraid of doing now and you think, well, if I'm afraid of it, why should I do it? People ask themselves the same question like I have a difficult conversation to have with their wives or their children or their parents, you know, because a lot of us are very conflict diverse and there are difficult conversations to have. And the reason is is because they're awkward and make us afraid. So you might think, well, why the hell is it makes you afraid? Why not just not, which is one of the ideas that keeps people in jobs they hate and in relationships with and, and it stops them from repairing or relationships with some very difficult thing to do. And the answer is, well, let's imagine that you just keep doing the thing that you don't like, that you don't change it because you're afraid to, well, are you afraid of what happens if you don't change it?

Speaker 1:          03:14          And if you lay out this little hail, but I described it really in a one way so you know where you would degenerate if you were going to degenerate. And then you look at life and say, well here's a bunch of things that are not doing because I'm afraid that's, you know, keeping me secure. It's like, no, it's not. It's just taking you to that place that you lay down. It's an absolute catastrophe. And so sometimes the answer to why should I do this thing that I've been putting off is well, otherwise they end up in this particular hell. I already know. I already know the parameters of and so hope can help you move out of that. It would be better if I did this, but fear of not doing it and the consequences. That's where you've been and what's better yet is to have both of them working in tandem, so psychologists figured this out when they were looking at sphere years ago because I'm trying to figure out how to motivate them to do things like run down a major update and reward.

Speaker 1:          04:12          Turns out that a hungry, hungry, rapid run down. A little bays quite rapidly get a cheesy, but if that brand is, if you. If you have the hungry wrap and you walk in some capital, expats are terrified of cats and even if they've never met a capital, just a different smell. The cash, they know what cat smell like and like. And so if you take your hungry, grab and throw in a little caterpillar, he'll sit down that runway like nap much faster than one that's just hungry. So running away from something that you're terrified out. We're avoiding something that your property terrified though and running towards something you want is a good way of being maximally motivate people and so with the second part of that program we have people, they don't have very detailed plan about their position in the briefing. If April's prior quiz tools and figure why would you be better if he would take the first goal was how would your families be better?

Speaker 1:          05:14          Also with maybe how it would be a benefit to the community if you would take that book because it'd be nice if you could sort yourself out in ways that also sorted out your family and then also sort of your community and since you're making a plan, but where the hell no name for all three. It's more sustainable anyways. Right. So this broke the famous psychologist show, Piaget hold, that included a braided state. He said that it's like a game that everyone wants to play with. It's better if you're going to play a game to play a game that everyone wants to play and that's a good. That's a good indication that it's a good game. And so if you could figure out how to fix yourself off in a way that would simple phineas, they fix up your family and your community. It's like, hey, everybody wins and maybe it would be good to play a game that everybody wins.

Speaker 1:          06:03          So we don't think of games that often, but it's certainly possible in 25 exists and so well back to courage and that free speech. One of the things that I do recommend that people who try these programs is that they do the map because if that plan has been that the no plan at all and you're going to come up with a better plan because what they have and you know, and so it's either a bad plan or no plan and no Glenn is way worse than a bad. At least when you implemented that plan and you start walking towards what the plan lays out, you'll see specifically where it is that you're an error like specifically. And you'll learn from that. And then you can use what you learn while you're making the mistakes. Implementing your plan to make a better plan. And if you keep doing that eventually, like there'll be a lot of failure along the way. That's the adventure of your life, by the way. If you do that and you keep laying on plant and learning painfully from your failures and then correcting the planet, what'll happen is that you get on target as you move through life, and even though you're hitting a moving target, because life is complicated.
