Speaker 1:          00:07          My chapter on theisms versions of Heaven, I sloped the idea. I probably won't be accepted by evangelicals and fundamentalists, but you know, when Jesus talked about the kingdom is within a images, there's not as, not as often as I would've liked, but I think he's referring to the fact that habit is within us in the sense that we should be aiming to improve ourselves. And you know, that Christians and atheists of conflicted over this passage where he says, uh, you know, Matthew Sixteen, Twenty six, I say unto you, there are some standing here which will not taste death until they see the son of man coming in his kingdom. And, you know, of course atheist, go, ha, ha, ha, he's still not here. Uh, but, but what if he meant something else that heaven is not a place to go, but a way to be

Speaker 2:          00:54          here. And now I'm very, I'm very, what would you call a viewpoint that I think is very much worth pursuing? I would also. But I also think there's something deeply strange about that too because, um, I think that if a psychological state becomes profound enough, it starts to become a social state. And so I would say that that, that Kingdom of God that's within, which is something tolstoy wrote a lot about, by the way, that was a book that he wrote, a book called the Kingdom of God is within us and that profoundly influenced Mahatma Gandhi by the way. And they had lengthy correspondence which was part of the reason that Gandhi became a non use nonviolent resistance right in his fight against the English, which was quite interesting. But I think that there is, there is there look something like this, maybe when you go to a concert, it's a great concert and you're having a very profound psychological experience of, of unity and harmony, which of course is what you get into concert.

Speaker 2:          01:54          But if the experience is profound enough psychologically and individually, it also starts to encompass and envelop the people around you. And so I think the Kingdom of God that Christ was talking about with something like this is why I like jumped piaget so much. It's something like the and equilibrated state where things are working out really well for you when you're deeply immersed in a meaningful experience, but at the same time that meaning is structured so that it's maximally beneficial for the people who are immediately around you and for the people who are distantly related to you. And so everything stacks up and some that's some. That's something like the idea of the ladder to have under the stairway to heaven, did everything stacking up properly and then there's an. There is. See, I think when people experience that, and this is where the metaphysics touches the material. I think that when people. Yes, exactly that precisely got yes. Precisely that.

Speaker 2:          02:45          Well, did you notice that the demons are upside down going down, right? Which is exactly right. That's exactly the right way to conceptualize it. So I think that when people have an experience of that stacking of meaning, that they also have an intimation of immortality that goes along with that. That's embodied and that that's partly why they're metaphysical speculations about the reality of the Kingdom of Heaven. There'll be merged because it's not just conceptual right there. There is embodied experience and people report the same thing when they have transcendental experiences of various sorts and those, and we know from a scientific perspective that those can be very reliably induced with the use of agents like psilocybin.
