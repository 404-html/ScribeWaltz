Speaker 1:          00:06          Is this pace from search for the holy grail. The Holy Grail is a myth that was constructed in Glenndon and the math goes something like this. There was a cop, the grail used to hold Christ's blood and that cop has a redemptive significance and it's been lost. And the night's King Arthur's night to go off to look for the holy grail or after this cup. So it's a redemption story, right? It means the world's damned unredeemed. There's some object that can serve as as the source of redemption, the source of nourishment, say, thinking about it from a symbolic perspective, and it's worthwhile to go on a quest of that sword. And the King Arthur's story is set up in an interesting way because there's a King Arthur, but he has all these nights, these nobles and they all sit at a round table and they're at a round table because they're equals.

Speaker 1:          00:56          So although it's a hierarchical story, there's a motif in it that transcends the hierarchy. It says, well, yeah, under normal circumstances, everyone's in arranged in a hierarchy, but when you're out to seek whatever you need, then everyone's an equal. And so fine. So they sit at the round table and then they go off to search for the holy grail. And the story opens with a very interesting Motif, which is the nights look at the forest and then they try to find the part that looks the darkest to them and then they go that way. That's the marker for their mission, right to go to the darkest place. And of course each night goes off in a different direction because the world looks slightly different to each night. So objectively speaking they're going to a different place, but psychologically speaking they're going to the same place. Right in that place I suppose is being represented in mythology and literature is the heart of darkness. And if you're ever curious about why people aren't enlightened, since it seems to be a possibility, you can always think about the story of King Arthur and the knights of the holy grail and think, well do you really want to enter the forest at the darkest place? And that's what that is. Of course. No, because the darkest place means precisely that place you least want to go. And it's the same for everyone.

Speaker 1:          02:16          So then I have this little nephew, although he's almost 15 now, he had this dream when he was four years old. And the background to the dream is this, he was waking up in the middle of the night for months screaming, he had night terrors and this went on for like six months. And what was happening in his life was two fold. There was some instability in his family because his parents got divorced about a year after that. And also he was at the transition point from staying at home to going to kindergarten. So you know, not only was he making the big move out there into the terrible world, but the stable point from which he might like to have moved was shaky. So you know, he wasn't having that great a time. So anyways, he's screaming away at night and this is pretty unsettling, right? Cause night terrors are no joke.

Speaker 1:          03:01          And so he's upset about it. His mom's upset about it and so I'm watching him and he's running around the house. He's only about this high, very verbal kid. And he's got this night hat on in this sword and the shield and he's running around the house being a night and at night he takes his night hack and his shield and his sword Tibet. Thank, oh that's pretty cool. And you can see how that makes sense, right? And you can see how it's an inactive reality cause children enact or act out their reality before they can explicitly understand it just like we do. And so I'm staying there. One night he wakes up and he has it, you know, one of these fits and then the next morning it comes to breakfast. And I said, hey, did you have any dreams last night? And he goes, yeah, I had a dream.

Speaker 1:          03:43          I said, well tell us the dream. And there's six adults sitting around the table. And then he says, okay, I, I was out in this field and I was surrounded by beat dwarves and they came up to my knees. And so these doors, they had no arms, they just had shoulders and powerful legs and they're all covered with hair. And they had a cross shaved on the top of their head and they were all covered with grease. And everywhere I went these doors would jump up with their beaks and bite me. And we're looking at, I'm like, that accounts for the night terrors, right? And so then he says, yeah, and there's more to it too. If you, if you looked in the background behind all the doors, there was a dragon way in the background and it was puffing out fire and smoke and every time it puffed out fire and smoke a whole bunch more of these dwarves would get made.

Speaker 1:          04:31          And you think that's pretty cool. That's a hydra story, right? Remember the story of the Hydra, you cut off one head, two more grows. It's one of Hercules, uh, trials. And that's an observation about the world, which is you solve one problem and like two more problems pop up and then you solve those. And anyways, he says, okay, well I've got this dragon back there. And so this is his problem, right? He's being eaten by beat dwarves and that's not good. And there's not much sense fighting them off because there's just more of a made every time this thing lurking in the background breeds. So I said, what could you do about that? It's like his brain was working all these ideas around and he'd heard lots of Disney stories and had lots of books read to them and had abstracted out a lot of information, but he hadn't quite got it right.

Speaker 1:          05:14          And it was all seeding around in his head. And I just said, well what could you do? Tap. And he went, oh, I know what I could do. I could take my sword and I'd get my dad, which is a good notion, right? Cause he's small. And then I jump up on the dragon and I'd pop out both of its eyes with the sword so it couldn't see me. And then I'd go down its throat to the box where the fire came out and then I carve a piece out of the box and I'd use that as a shield. And I thought, great, you really got the story and the story. Something like this, right? If you're being plagued by midget dwarfs and you wipe them out and they keep multiplying while you're obviously aiming at the wrong target, right? You should be going to their source.

Speaker 1:          05:53          So he went after the dragon, but not only after the dragon, he went right down the throat of the Dragon, which is, you know, a fairly brave thing to do. And then right to the place where the fire, the transforming element was being produced. And he took a piece of the device that made the transforming element and he used it as a shield. Okay, well that's really cool. And the story is better than that I think. And it's true even so it's not one of those fake, he was dreaming and then woke up sorta stories. This actually happened. He didn't have any more nightmares. So when I checked with his mother repeatedly after that, because I thought, well, this is too good to be true, right? It's got this terrible night terror thing. He does one little mythological dream thing and bang, he's, he's better.

Speaker 1:          06:33          But that's the case. He didn't have any more nightmares after that. And I think that's because he don't almost already got it right. He's running around like a night. He knew almost just had to be made a little more explicit and not even not explicit cause it was still a story. Uh, he didn't know you should go to the source of your anxieties, right to the thing that plagues you the most. And you should explore that in detail until you find the information that it contains that will protect you against it. He couldn't say that, but he can tell the story and he could act it out and that looked like it was good enough. So that's pretty cool. So he basically, you know, he managed this, essentially, he fought the dragon of chaos and pop back up as what, as he who can obtain victory over the dragon of chaos. And that's a pretty good story because it says, well, if your frame of reference gets blown away by something you don't understand some new challenge, and you face the challenge at least courageously and humility and humbly, which means you know you're not gonna run away on, you still have something to learn, then you can extract something out of the battle that will enable you to withstand.
