Speaker 1:          00:07          What happened, the academy has, has always leaned left in the 20th century, but leaning isn't the problem. So people think, oh, viewpoint diversity we need, we need everybody. We need Nazis. We need. No, we don't need everybody. What we need is no orthodoxy. That's what's fatal orthodoxy. So if you have a, if you have a field like sociology or social psychology in which it's two or three to one left to right, that's totally fine with me. That's totally fine because if someone makes some claim that's just like ideologically blind, someone will say, uh, you know, common sense, other evidence that you've missed and then the system works. But what I learned when I started down this road in 2011, I gave a talk at the big conference with social psychologists. I gave a talk about this problem that we're losing our diversity, that I could only find one conservative in the entire field.

Speaker 1:          01:03          And I gave a talk on this. Um, and um, um, and so what I've learned since then is that the ratio in psychology was between two to one and four to one left, right? All the way up to the early nineties, we've gathered together all of the studies we could find. So all the up to the early nineties, it's only three or four to one left to right, which would be okay. Um, but then between 1995 or four and 2010, it goes to a 14 to one. Do you have any idea why and why that time? Yes. So, um, so you get the same story whether you look at Republican, Democrat ratios or liberal conservative there, they tell the same story. So the two of the big things going on there are one is that the greatest generation which had a lot of Republicans, um, so a lot of men go off to World War II.

Speaker 1:          01:54          They are there on the Gi bill. They entered the academy in the 19 fifties. A lot of them are conservative or Republican and so you have a lot of them, but in the sixties and seventies, one of the main reasons to go to Grad school and the social sciences is either a to stay in school to escape the Vietnam war draft or be to fight for social justice and against racism. So in sociology and psychology in particular and political science maybe I'm not sure. You get a huge influx of left leaning people who are there to pursue social justice so you know the motives are fine and if it was balanced to be totally fine, but as you get these young junior people on the left come in in the seventies and eighties and then you get the older people that are more politically balanced, retiring of the eighties and nineties.

Speaker 1:          02:38          By the time you get to the late nineties it's all baby boomers and so do you get a. You get a positive feedback loop developing their. Like you said, if it's like three to one, it's okay, but maybe when it hits four to one it goes to like 20 to one. Then you stick. Exactly. So then, so then you start getting hostile climate. So I wrote a review paper on this with a, with Joe Duarte and Phil and lead Justin Jarrett, Crawford, um, um, and um, um, and we, uh, we reviewed everything that we could find and we concluded that most of what's going on is self selection. That is people on the left are more open to experience. They're always going to get self selection. But then there's really good evidence that there's also hostile climate. I mean, it's undeniable now that if you are not on the left in a Grad program, there's just constant little subtle or not so subtle reminders that you don't belong.

Speaker 1:          03:29          And in the academy we're all about saying, Hey, if there are subtle hints here and there, you can't succeed. Right? I mean, that's what we do for a living is when we say that little things will stop people. Um, well, little things are put in the way of anyone who doesn't fit politically. Uh, and so you do get hostile climate, you do get over discrimination. There's evidence of that. And then there is also, it is part of the story here that what it means to be a conservative in the nineties and especially 2000 has changed. So, um, it is true that you know, that, that the, the conservative, we're not in any way anti-science, um, until much more recent times. Now actually both sides are anti-science about different sciences. But I'm in America, the right wing, the Republican Party has, it's controversial, but I do believe that the polarization starts with the right moving further out.

Speaker 1:          04:18          So what it means to be conservative to the anti anti evolutionary, which is actually what's happening on the left now to exactly. That's. Yeah. So, well as modern laptop to Bret Weinstein the other day. And you know, he, he, one of his claims is that evolutionary biology has something in it to offend everyone. So it's a, it's a science that's very likely to be targeted by extremists. You also brought up something that actually touches on the site on the difficult problem of how it is that you might define someone who is ideologically possessed, let's say, or ideologically rigid, because the idea was that you can make a valid case for the utility of free information flow and the free flow of people that would go along with that and you could make a good case for the danger of that. And so the idea might be that if you're only making a case for the danger of that, then you're tilted too far to the right.

Speaker 1:          05:07          And if you're only making a case for the utility of that, then you're tilted too far to the left. Exactly. That's right. And so we can look at immigration as a nice example. There was a recent essay in the Atlantic, I think it was by Peter Beinart, where he, um, he reviews. He had started with a lot of quotes that are pretty nuanced positions about immigration from Barack Obama. Paul Krugman, a bunch of other people on the left who used to be able to say, on the one hand, you know, compassion, economic, on the other hand, you know, we have to have a legal process and there's a threat to low wage workers, so people on the left, you still have to talk about immigration and talk about the pros and cons, pluses and minuses, but beinart shows how in the last four or five years you can't if you so much as suggest that will maybe immigration is a net good, but it might have some deleterious effects on certain classes of of low wage American workers.

Speaker 1:          06:00          You could get in big trouble, right? Because that's instantly prejudicial because immigration has become a sacred topic. So this is the key thing that I want everyone to keep in mind. We are fundamentally religious creatures were built for religion and it's a great achievement to create a scientific establishment and an academic establishment that keeps that way of thinking out. Scientific thinking is not natural thinking. Religious thinking is natural thinking and what's happening to us in the last few years especially is a flooding in of religious thinking and so let's get a bunch of social scientists talk about immigration. What are they going to do? Look at the data, way up. The pluses and minuses. No, they're going to. Many of them feel they're on a team and that team is fighting the right. The right is anti-immigrant. It includes racist elements there for that justifies us in being pro.

Speaker 1:          06:50          Immigration and social sciences are always. There's always ambiguity. There's always conflicting stories, multiple causal factors. Is that always in the social science study? That's right. So [inaudible] point was that the left used to be able to think straight about immigration. Clearly it had a, you know, it was generally pro immigration, but it used to be able to think straight, but in the last few years a religious orthodox mindset has overtaken it. Okay. So we might as well also pointed out that it's a primordial religious mindset, right? Because I mean there are definitely Christian or Jewish, I mean ancient tribal, small scale, lots of gods. Right, right. Well, so then one of the things that you might suggest is that when you throw out a sophisticated religious structure in unsophisticated religious structure comes in to fill the gap. I do. So that's true. That's definitely worth thinking about. So that's right.

Speaker 1:          07:41          So that's right. The thing with religions, we have to clarify, fundamentalism is the problem, not religion. And so if you close tribalism, that's right. If you get a fundamentalist, you know, I'm happy to say, and if you have people applying to a Grad program in psychology and I find out that they're Christian, that's fine. There's no problem. But if they're fundamentalist Christian, I would think, well let's say let's say it's not psychologists, it's a geology. So somewhat applies to a geology program. There are fundamentalists, young, earth creationist. Are you gonna admit them? No, I don't think you should. They're not able to do the right kind of thinking based on what we know to be the case there. They're not in the scientific paradigm, not in the sand type. That's right. So, so if we wouldn't admit a fundamentalist Christian to a geology program, why would we admit someone who is just as fundamentalist about certain moral and political issues into a sociology program or into a psychology program if they come in knowing what the right answer is, committed to that right answer, likely to get angry at anyone who contravenes that right answer.

Speaker 1:          08:47          Um, and, and showing signs of close mindedness. I don't think they belong in the. I guess the question is how in the world do you set up mechanisms to ensure that you're not swamped by fundamentalists of any sort? So those are people who are reducing everything to a single cause. It's something like that. How can you implement a structure that protects the organization against that without the structure itself becoming totalitarian? Because these things, these things spin out of control so fast. But so, you know, I think what we have to realize in the academy is that we face, I think we face an existential crisis. Um, we rely on an enormous amount of public goodwill. We get enormous tax subsidies, a direct research support and recent polling shows that while Democrats have always had a higher opinion of the universities and Republicans until two years ago, everybody thought universities are a good thing.

Speaker 1:          09:42          They make life better. So Americans have been very supportive of higher education. There have been rising gripes on the right, but it's only between 2015 and 2017 that now republicans go from saying mostly universities are good things in two years. They go way down and say universities are bad things. They're making things worse. Now, how is this news greeted? Pundits on the left are saying, oh, those republicans are so anti science. Look how ignorant they are. They now hate universities. Come on. Anybody who's been watching the news, anybody who's seen the mobs, the shout downs, the illiberal behavior, you know, the metaphor I use is like, you know, Americans on the right and left are really supportive of the military. We have. It's one of the few institutions that we still hold in highest team on both sides. And so the Republicans more than Democrats.

Speaker 1:          10:29          So suppose you had Gallup poll and I, uh, showing Republicans liked the military more than Democrats, but both really liked it. Then suddenly in 2015 we started seeing video from all over military bases and military academies in which the, the military leaders are overtly right wing. They're there, they're saying terrible things about leftists and progressives and the midshipmen and the cadets and everybody is mobbing the occasional liberal and to behaving in a really despicable, scary and intimidating way. What do you think the left would now think about the military? Obviously support for the military would plummet and that's what's happening in America with universities. We are losing the support of half the country. This is unsustainable, especially in red states where, you know, they control the purse strings. So I think we have a major crisis. I think we've got to go into crisis mode and we've got to clean up our act. So just as we're doing in psychology with replication project where we recognize that our methods weren't good enough and we're doing a crash course, a thanks to Brian Nosek and others, the open science project, we're really trying to improve our game. Thank God we need to. I think we have to do the exact same thing about partisanship and our on our duty.
