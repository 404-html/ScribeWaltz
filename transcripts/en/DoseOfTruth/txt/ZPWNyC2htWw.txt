Speaker 1:          00:06          I think it was the Ernstein Herrnstein and Murray I think did the calculations back in the bell curve that indicated that if you imagine that you could, you are a fairy godmother and you have your newborn grandchild in front of you and you can grant them three standard deviations above the mean, um, in terms of wealth at birth. Or you can grant them three standard deviations above the mean in terms of Iq at birth. And then you want it to determine which would work better for them by the time they were 40. And the answer to that was quite clear is that Iq Trump's wealth to right, it'd be able to predict a positive future.

Speaker 2:          00:46          So that's why I'm so interested in the concept of increasing Iq or increasing the g factor, not just the Iq score, but really what under this reasoning ability. So you know, some people have tried to teach college students critical thinking. Yeah, I think that's a good thing. You can get it and you can think critically so much the better. Exactly. You know, and you know, it may sound to your listeners, I just want to take a moment out here. It may sound to your listener, it's like, here are these two guys pontificating about what it's like to be smart, what it's like to be not so smart. I mean, the point of this, the point of neuro science research, all intelligence. So what I hope to achieve by writing the book was to show that that the genetic aspects are not deterministic. It's the opposite. So our probabilistic, so the extent to which something like an intelligence is genetic, in my view, is the extent to which we'll learn how to change it for the battery. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:52          Because people do tend to think about biological factors is deterministic and that that's a mistake because they can be shifted.
