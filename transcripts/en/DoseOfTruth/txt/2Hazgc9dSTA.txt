Speaker 1:          00:07          How could I overcome my fear of driving on freeways? Well, one of the things you could do, this is Ellis is do a fair bit of imagining driving on freeways and try to make the imagining as realistic as possible. But then the other thing you can do is it's again, it's graduated exposure. If you're afraid of driving, go drive with someone you trust in a parking lot on Sunday morning when there's no one there and then drive around the block and a street that isn't busy and then go to a slightly busier street and then go to a slightly busier street and then find a highway that's like a just a two layer so that you know you could practice merging and that sort of thing. And you got to build a plan, say with 20 degrees of difficulty with the highest degree of difficulty, maybe being more merging onto a busy four lane highway.

Speaker 1:          00:55          And you could go at night and practice merging onto the busy highway because it won't be busy at night. So I would say what you do is you break it down into small steps and then practice each step until you're bored with the step. And when you're bored with it, that means you're no longer anxious about it and don't quit. You know, like stick at it because it's really useful to overcome a fear. And once you've identified a fear, then you've identified something to overcome that can definitely make you stronger. So like, good luck with it and get professional, like take a driving course if you need to as well, and find someone to work with. It isn't going to make you nervous and isn't going to harass you, but don't quit. It's really important to overcome a fear. Lucked out.
