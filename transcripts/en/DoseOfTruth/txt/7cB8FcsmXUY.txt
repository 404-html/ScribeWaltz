Speaker 1:          00:06          On the radical left and they're superficial view, belief and value on the environment. How has this influenced by their own raw emotions inviting, questionable, immoral, and dangerous actions despite good intentions? Well, I don't really buy the whole good intentions thing. I mean, I think that it's really hard to have good intentions. Like John the, the question I just answered, you know, John said, looking at myself honestly, I'm deeply envious and resentful of others happiness. Well, if you listen to the Lindsay shepherd recording at Wilfrid laurier university and you listen to the professors and that the administrators, I think that it's, uh, it's, it's absurd to start with the presupposition that they have good intentions. I don't think they have good intentions at all. So, um, but you know, we could give the devil his due and say that there are people on the left end of the spectrum, like, like there are all parts of the spectrum who are, are trying to do good things, but having good intentions and figuring out how to do well in the world are our good intentions are only the beginning.

Speaker 1:          01:14          And people are always influenced by raw emotions and fuzzy thinking and it's hard to think critically and it's hard to plan strategically and it's hard to, to intervene in the world in a way that doesn't cause trouble, which is partly why I recommend to people that they start local, you know, you can't even trust your own good intentions to some degree because you have to test out what you do when you have good intentions and see if it actually produces the result that's intended. But I wouldn't make the case to begin with that. Um, especially on the radical end of the left, I think it's unbelievably motivated by resentment.
