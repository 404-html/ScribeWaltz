Speaker 1:          00:06          So let's say, let's say you go into a, you can do this in a room, it's quite fun to do it just when you're sitting in a room like a room, maybe your bedroom, you can sit there and just sort of meditate on it. Think, okay, if I wanted to spend 10 minutes making this room better, what would I have to do? And you have to ask yourself that, right? It's not a command. It's like our genuine question and things will pop out in the room that you know, you like there's a stack of papers over there that's kind of bugging you and you know that maybe little order there would be a good thing and you know, you haven't. There's some rubbish behind your computer monitor that you haven't attended to for like six months and the room would be slightly better if it was a little less dusty and the cables weren't all tangled up the same way.

Speaker 1:          00:49          And like if you, if you allow yourself just to consider the expanse in which you exist at that moment, there'll be all sorts of things that'll pop out in it that you could just fix. And you know, I might say, well, if you were coming to see me for psychotherapy, this easiest thing for us to do first would just be to get you to organize your room. You think, well, is that psychotherapy? And the answer is, well, it depends on how you conceive the limits of your being. And I would say start where you can start, you know, if, if something announces itself to you, which is a strange way of thinking about it, as in need of repair that you could repair, then hey, fix it. You fix 100. Things like that. Your life will be a lot different. Now, I often tell people to fix the things that you repeat every day because people tend to think of those as trivial, right?

Speaker 1:          01:45          You get up, you brush your teeth, you have your breakfast. You know, you have your routines that you go through everyday. Well, those probably constitute 50 percent of your life and people think, well there Monday and I don't need to pay attention to them. It's like, no, no, that's exactly wrong. The things you do every day, those are the most important things you do hands down. All you have to do is do the arithmetic. You figure it out right away, so 100 adjustments to your broader domain of being and there's a lot less rubbish and there's a lot less rubbish around at a lot fewer traps for you to step into and so that's in keeping with [inaudible] idea about erasing the dis. Once you've got your mind and your emotions together and once you're acting that out, then you can extend what you're willing to consider yourself and start fixing up the things that are a part of your broader extent.

Speaker 1:          02:40          Now sometimes you don't know how to do that, so you might say, imagine you're walking down bloor street and there's this guy who's like alcoholic and schizophrenia and has been on the streets for 10 years. He sorta stumbled towards you and you know, incoherently mutters something. That's a problem and it would be good if you could fix it, but you haven't a clue about how to fix that. You just walk around that and go find something that you could fix because if you muck about it that not only is it unlikely that you'll help that person, it's very likely that you'll get hurt yourself. So you know, just because while you're experiencing things announced themselves as in need of repair, it doesn't mean that it's. You write that in there that should repair them. You have to have some humility. You know, you don't walk up to a helicopter that isn't working and just start tinkering away with it.

Speaker 1:          03:29          You have to stay within your domain of competence. But most of the time if people look at their lives, you know, it's very interesting thing to do. I liked the, I liked the idea of the room because you can do that at the drop of a hat. You know, we go back to where you live and sit down and think, okay, I'm going to make this place better for half an hour. What should I do it they have to ask and things will just pop up like mad and it's partly because your mind is a very strange thing. As soon as you give it a name, a genuine aim, it'll reconfigure the world and keeping with that aim that that's actually how you see to begin with. And so if you set it a task, especially if you have to be genuine about it, which is why you have to bring your thoughts and emotions together and then you have to get them into your body so you're acting consistently.

Speaker 1:          04:16          You have to be genuine about the aim, but once you aim the world will reconfigure itself around that aim, which is very strange and, and it's, it's, it's technically true. You know, the best example of that, you have all seen this video where you watch the basketballs being tossed back and forth between members of the white team versus the black team. And while you're doing that, a gorilla walks up into the middle of the video and you don't see it. It's like you know, if you thought about that experiment for about five years, that would be about the right amount of time to spend thinking about it because what it shows you is that you see what you aim at and that man, if you can get one thing through your head and as a consequence of even being in university, that would be a good one.

Speaker 1:          05:01          You see what you a map and so because one inference you might draw from that is be careful what you aim at. Write it. What you aim at determines the way the world manifests itself to you, and so if the world is manifesting itself in a very negative way, one thing to ask is, are you aiming at the right thing? Now, you know I'm not trying to reduce everybody's problems to an improper aim. People get cut off at the knees for all sorts of reasons. You know they get sick, they have accidents. There's a random element to being, that's for sure, but and so you don't want to take anything. Even that particular phrase too far. You want to bind it with the fact that random things do happen to people, but it's still a great thing to ask. Okay, so rogers was a phenomenologist and he was interested in.

Speaker 1:          05:50          He didn't start his philosophy from the perspective of subject versus object or from the idea of psyche, like sort of inside you, your mind with its layers. That's not how we looked at it and so let's go through. Well, I'll introduce you to rogers I think, and then we'll talk about it more next time. I'm going to start though with something that I learned from him that I think it was of crucial importance and so we'll set the stage for the further discussion with this and I'm going to read it to you. Assuming a minimal mutual willingness to be in contact and to receive communications. We may say that the greater the community, the communicated congruence of experience, awareness and behavior on the part of one individual, the more the ensuing relationship will involve a tendency towards reciprocal communication with the same qualities, mutually accurate understanding of the communication's improved, psychological adjustment and functioning in both parties and mutual satisfaction.

Speaker 1:          06:51          In the relationship, it's quite a mouthful. What does it mean? Assuming a minimal mutual willingness to be in contact and to receive communications. Okay, we're having a conversation. I'm deciding I'm going to listen to you. Right? That's different than how people generally communicate because usually when they communicate, they're doing something like, okay, we're going to have a conversation and I'm going to tell you why I'm right and all win. If you agree or maybe you're having a conversation where I don't know what you're trying to do, maybe you're trying to impress the person you're talking to so you're not listening to them at all. You're just thinking about what you're gonna say next. Okay, so that's not this. This is. You might have something to tell me and so I'm going to listen on the off chance that you'll tell me something that would really be useful for me to know, and so you could take about it as an as an extension of the Piagetian.

Speaker 1:          07:47          Piaget talks about the fundamental, the fundamentally important element of knowledge being to describe how knowledge is sought, the process by which knowledge is generated. Well, if you agree with me and I find that out, I know nothing more than I knew before. I just know what I knew before and maybe I'm happy about that because it didn't get challenged, but I'm no smarter than I was before, but maybe you're different than me and so while I'm listening to you, you'll tell me something I wouldn't. I don't like. Maybe it's something I find contemptible or difficult, whatever. Maybe you'll find you'll tell me something I don't know and then I won't be quite as stupid and then maybe I won't run painfully into quite as many things. And that's a really useful thing to know. Especially if you live with someone and you're trying to make longterm piece with them as they are not the same as you and they're away.

Speaker 1:          08:35          They look at the world and the facts that they pull out of the world aren't the same as your facts and even though you're going to be overwhelmed with the proclivity to demonstrate that you're right, it is the case. The two brains are better than one, and so maybe nine of the 10 things they tell you are dispensable or maybe even 49 out of 50, but one thing all you need to get out of the damn conversation is one thing you don't know. And one of the things that's very cool about a good psychotherapeutic session is that the whole conversation is like that all you're doing is trying to express the truth of the situation as clearly as possible. That's it. And so now rogers' proposition, and I'll tell you why he derived it, was that if you have a conversation like that with someone, it will make both of you better.

Speaker 1:          09:33          It'll make both of you is psychologically healthier. So there's an implicit presupposition that the exchange of truth is curative. Well, that's a very cool idea. I mean, it's a very deep idea. Uh, I think it's the most profound idea. It's the, it's the idea upon western civil upon which Western civilization, although not only Western civilization, is actually predicated the idea that truth produces health. But for Rogers, that was the entire purpose of the psycho therapeutic alliance. You come to see me because you want to be better. You don't even know what that means necessarily. Neither do I. we're going to figure that out together, but you come and you say, look, things are not acceptable to me and maybe there's something I could do about that. So that's the minimal precondition to engage in therapy. Something's wrong. You're willing to talk about it truthfully and you want it to be better.

Speaker 1:          10:25          Without that, the therapeutic relationship does not get off the ground and so then you might ask, well, what relationships are therapeutic and answered. That would be if you have a real relationship, it's therapeutic. If it isn't, what you have is not a relationship. God only knows what you have. You're a slave, they're a tyrant. You know you're both butting heads with one another. It's a primate dominance hierarchy dispute. Oh, I don't know what you're like, two cats in a barrel or two people with their hands around each other's throats, but what you have is not a relationship.
