Speaker 1:          00:01          Crippled religions, that's the right way to think about them. They're like a religion that's missing an arm and a leg but can still haul bill along and it, it provides a certain amount of security and group identity, but it's, it's warped and twisted and demented and banter and it's a parasite on something underlying that's rich and true. And that's how it looks to me anyways. And, and so. So I think it's very important that we sort out this problem. Um, I think that, I think that there isn't anything more important that needs to be done than that. I've, I've thought that for a long, long time, probably since the early eighties when I started looking at the site, the role that belief systems played in regulating psychological and social health, um, because they, you can tell that they do that because of how upset people get. If you challenge their belief systems, it's like, why the hell do they care?

Speaker 1:          00:55          Exactly. What difference does it make if, if all of your ideological axioms are 100 percent correct? Like people get unbelievably upset when you, when you poke them in the axioms. So to speak, and it isn't, it is not by any stretch of the imagination, obvious why, you know, but there's some, it's like there's a fundamental truth that they're standing on. It's like they're on a raft in the middle of the ocean and you're starting to pull up the logs, you know, and they're afraid they're going to fall in and drown. It's like drowning. What and what are the logs protecting themselves, protecting them from and why are they so afraid to, to move beyond the confines of the ideological system. And these are not obvious things.
