Speaker 1:          00:00          I realized that a belief system was actually a set of moral guidelines and moral guidelines are guidelines about how you should behave. Also, how you should perceive, and the reason that a moral guideline is necessary for you to perceive is that you can't look at anything without a hierarchy of value, right? Think about it like how many things in this room could you look out? There's an in innumerable things in this room to look at. There's just all this squares, the little tiny squares in this fabric. You could look at those things for till the end of time, one at a time, but you don't do that. In fact, if I took most of you out of this room, there's a very low probability that you'll be, you'd be able to tell me what color the walls were, or even if those things were on the walls.

Speaker 1:          00:50          And the reason for that is that who cares? As long as the walls don't move, colors irrelevant, and there's no reason for you to remember it. It has no emotional significance. It has no value. And so what you do instead is, well, this is what you're doing. So why are you here? Do I don't mean in the broad metaphysical sense? I mean specifically, why are you here right now? And I would say, well, you're a students obviously and you're trying to get a degree and you know, you believe that that will have some functional utility. Maybe you'll be a little wiser and a little more literate and a little and be able to think a little better and be able to write a little better. And so you'll actually be more functional in the world. That would be good. You know, and, and maybe you're interested in, but anyways, it's, you're in this particular lecture so that you can take this particular class so that you can get a particular kind of degree so that you can launch your life.

Speaker 1:          01:50          And then in your life you're probably going to meet someone that you have a longterm relationship with and you're going to have children and you're going to partake in the society. And that's why you're here. All of those reasons simultaneously is why you're here. And so then that helps you decide what to look at. And so what you look at is at the moment, or listen to is me, because in principle, I'm the gateway to that set of accomplishments at this moment. And so you focus on me and that's because you value that. And so what that means.
