And that's what persona means is the mask that you wear to convince yourself and the world that you're not a terrible monster. So that when you look at yourself in the mirror, you don't have to run away screaming. You know, when you might think, well that's a bit of an overstatement, but you'll was very interested in phenomena such as, um, say psychological, the psychological phenomena that would characterize the actions of someone who might be an Auschwitz camp guard for example. And uh, you know, that's pretty monstrous form of behavior. And the thing about Auschwitz camp guards is that there's no reason to assume really that they were much different than normal people. Now, there would have been exceptions obviously, but, and what that means is that perhaps you two could be an Auschwitz camp guard and perhaps he would even derive some enjoyment out of it. And you might think not, but you shouldn't think not so quickly. And what that also implies is that if you could see what that meant when you looked in the mirror and looked at yourself, you might run away screaming because you'd have a revelation of just exactly what the human being is capable of. And that's a very unpleasant revelation. And also one of the things that stops people from being enlightened because that revelation of the evil of the self is part of the journey to enlightenment and an early part.
