Speaker 1:          00:10          Okay. Let's see here. I'm a British conservative millennial training to be a school teacher. How can I protect children age five to 11 from postmodernism, which is everywhere in school. God, that's a good question. That's Freya Hana. That was the main video I was making today was about that.

Speaker 2:          00:31          Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:32          Teach them what you believe to be true. Right? Formulate for yourself. A philosophy of education. A serious one. Write it down, right. You can think about it as a mission statement, but write it down. Spend some time on it man. Cause You're devoting your whole life to that. Figuring out what kind of teacher you want to be and come up with articulated reasons why you're going to be that sort of teacher and then do it come hell or high water. You know like often there's kids out there that only have to run into one good adult and that will set them on a proper course through the life. And you could be that one good adult. So I would say learn everything you can about paws postmodernism. So you're a master of it. Decide what sort of teacher you want to be. Implement that, and, and you'll, you'll be a bulwark against that kind of catastrophic foolishness and, and help many, many people.
