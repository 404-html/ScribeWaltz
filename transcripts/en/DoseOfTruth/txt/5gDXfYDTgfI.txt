Speaker 1:          00:00          Wow,

Speaker 1:          00:09          the next part of the story, there's some parallels with Abraham and that's built into the narrative, I think because Isaac is Abraham's descendant and so we have to keep the narrative echoing forward. Otherwise it loses its, it's continuity. And um, there was a famine in the land that Isaac Isaacson and God tells him to stay the course anyways, repeating the promise. He, he gave Abraham, although Isaac goes to Abdel Malek, also telling the king and people that Rebecca was his sister, which is exactly what Abraham did when he went to Egypt. And so there's another echo there of the same, the same. It's as if the story is being told for a second time essentially. And that's supposed to remind you of the, of the previous story, but they're careless. The king sees that Rebecca and Isaac are intimate together. And um, luckily he doesn't have them put to death.

Speaker 1:          01:03          He just tells everybody in the kingdom that there to be left the hell alone. And then Isaac prospers in that land, just like Abraham did in Egypt until the Philistines asked him to leave. He's just getting too rich and powerful. Things are going too well for him, so he's asked to. He's asked to leave. Now, in the meantime, Esau gets married and this is a funny little story. He says he marries two women who give grief to Isaac and Rebecca, so they, whoever he saw Mary's, they're not popular with his, with their in laws, not in the least. That actually becomes relevant a little later because they drive rebecca quite mad. So I get a kick out of that because that's very common. You know, it's not easy to integrate new people into your family and hope that that will go smoothly. It's actually one of the real catastrophes in life, right?

Speaker 1:          01:52          You have a kid, maybe you get along with them and maybe you don't, but let's assume you do, but then they marry someone that you just don't like and or maybe you think is wrong for them. I mean, that's really rough. That's what are you going to do about that? You know, because you're, you're basically screwed both ways. If you have the person you love around, then you have to put up with this horrendous creature that they allied themselves with. And if you, if you get rid of them completely, well then you know you don't have your child anymore. So it's very, very difficult position. And so that's another example of the realism, I think, of the stories. Now, Isaac, who's hypothetically on his deathbed asks Esl to hunt for Venison because he likes venison and he's happy that his son is a hunter and Rebecca overhears this so she conspires with Jacob, um, to, to slaughter to small goats and make his father is some stew because he wants to make him stew out of venison.

Speaker 1:          02:49          But Rebecca, who's being, I would say, let's say slightly deceitful or horribly lying that would be more accurate. Um, she conspires with Jacob. Jacob kills two little goats kids and boils, APA stew. And then he puts on some, uh, are goatskins because Esau was a hairy character. And, and Rebecca Dresses Isaac in east clothing because Isaac can't see very well at this point. And so then Jacob goes into his father with the stew and he's trying to disguise his voice, but it doesn't work very well. And so Isaac asks them to come close and Jacob puts out his arm with the goat skin on it and, and Isaac smells him too. And he smells like Esl and, which maybe wasn't the best thing, but, um, and feels like, um, and so, uh, because Isaac thinks he's on his deathbed, he decides to deliver a blessing to hypothetically to Esol.

Speaker 1:          03:48          And so, but it's Jacob. And so that's a big deal too because the blessing is actually, as I said before with these ancient people, it appeared as though once you said something, you didn't get to take it back, you couldn't say, well look, you've deceived me. So it doesn't count. It was like I did. They weren't maybe as as well, week might be one way of thinking about it, but another way is they weren't quite as attentive to context, you know, because if I make you a deal and then it turns out that you betrayed me, I may feel that the deal is no longer valid because the assumption was you were being honest to be given within that violates the whole spirit. But that isn't how these people thought. They said once he promised man, you promised, and that was that. So Isaac Blessed Jacob. He says that God give you the dew of heaven and the fatness of the earth and plenty of corn and wine.

Speaker 1:          04:41          Let people serve you and nations bow down to you. Be Lord over their brethren that's going to be rough on Esl. Let thy mother's sons bow down to the cursive. Be everyone that curse if the blessing, he blesses blessing. And so there's a credit remarkable painting of that. So there's Rebecca, she's looking pretty old and Isaac's looking pretty blind and Jacob's taking directions from his mother and we might say he's perhaps a little old to be taking more or lessons from his mother, especially given how she's acting. And so it's a pretty ugly scene altogether, especially that we also know that Jacob already tricked Esau out of his birthright. And so now he's like taking the birthright and he's taken the blessing. And so as I said that Jacob, he turns out to be the father of Israel. It's like he's a reprehensible character. These are major league betrayals that he's engaging and it's not trivial.

Speaker 1:          05:35          He really, really pulls the rug out from under his brother and you know, you could say, well Esl is not as awake as he might be. You know, he's kind of a wild man and fair enough. But it certainly seems to me that, that the predominant moral error falls on Jacob's shoulders. It's very treacherous behavior. What he's doing. So then Esau shows up and he's got a Nice Steg for his dad and it's like little late for that. And he states that his brother was rightly named Jacob, which means supplanter because he's been deceived twice and Isaac says, Isaac answered. He's, he's asking for Esl, was asking fundamentally if there's anything at all leftover for him. And Isaac can't give him the same blessing because that's already been given. So he has to think of something else. And Isaac says, behold, I, I've made him my Lord, and all his brothers I've given to him for servant, which includes you and with corn and wine, have I sustained him?

Speaker 1:          06:33          And what shall I now doing tv my son. And Esau said unto his father, how have you even one blessing for me, my father bless me also. And An esaw lifted up his voice and wept. And you know, we already know that Esau is a pretty tough guy by all appearances. And you know, he's out there hunting on his own and camping. And it's like he's no pushover. And the fact that this reduces him to tears is an indication of the magnitude of the betrayal. And Isaac says, behold, thy dwelling shall be the fatness of the earth and of the dew of heaven, from above and by Thy Sword, thou shall live, and thou shalt serve your brother, and it shall come to pass when you will have the domain Indian and you'll break the yolk. His yoke off from died neck. And the Esol hated Jacob because of the blessing where with his father blessed him. And Esau said in his heart, the days of mourning for my father are at hand. Then I will slay my brother Jacob. So fundamentally, you know, if Isaac dies or when he dies, then we'll mourn for him. And then Jacob better look the hell out because it's like it's serious death coming his way.
