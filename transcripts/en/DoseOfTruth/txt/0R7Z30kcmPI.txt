Speaker 1:          00:07          That was my next point is obviously those letters are on the intranet. So I was able to read them that various professors and a certain um, faculty, um, had signed. And because you're tenured in many ways that's a, that's a very strong safety net. But do you ever have those moments where you really feel like they are, that you, that there is a very strategic attempt to demonize you and to isolate you in the university as much as possible almost to the point that you would, God forbid it feel like you needed to leave or resign?

Speaker 2:          00:46          Well, I think that my job actually was in danger for about three months in, in the year ago when all of this broken, the diversity didn't really know what to do. I think that they got themselves together by December and then I went back teaching in January and that went very well. I've had zero negative interactions with students. None and no negative interactions with faculty members or administrators for that matter? Like not personally. I think that there's a coterie of people, um, the women and Gender Studies Institute, for example, in and of course all the people whose disciplines I've vilified. Yeah. And rightly so in my estimation because I don't regard them as disciplines. There are pseudo disciplines and they're corrupting the university and more than the university. So I feel no compunctions whatsoever about what I've said about those disciplines. I think there, I don't, it's, I would be hard pressed to say anything good about the whatsoever.

Speaker 2:          01:44          Um, and of course, and I've, I've really gone after the Ontario Institute of Studies of Education. I think I've referred to it repeatedly as a rat's nest central, which I really believe, I think it's an unbelievably dangerous organization. And so it's not surprising that people are, especially the people who were associated with those areas are not happy about me, but, um, that's okay. They can be unhappy about me. That's not a problem. Um, yeah, I think that'll change, but I don't think they have any ability whatsoever to move me from my position. I think the faculty is, like a month ago, the Faculty Association wrote a letter to the university condemning me because of this website I had talked about making, um, which I'm still toying with. I, I'm redesigning it to her. I think I'm going to set it up so that they will identify non postmodern courses instead of identifying postmodern courses. I think that's a better tack. And uh, but you know, they, they accused me of setting up a hate list of doxing and all sorts of ridiculous things, but it's just not getting any traction. Serena, it's,

Speaker 1:          02:57          it was almost inevitable. The, you know, as you became more popular in your videos are being watched by millions and your reach, and they're scaremongering tactics haven't worked that they would actually resort to some more desperate measures to vilify you. And I think the latest thing they found was this website that you're planning.
