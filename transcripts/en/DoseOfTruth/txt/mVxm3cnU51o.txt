Speaker 1:          00:06          I would like to ask you about this as well, because as a, as a man would go yuck pain in a country like Sweden, you have to, I would say that I think a lot of boys at least, or I'm confused what it means to be a man. And then you have these public figures, adult males admitting to collective guilt and trying to be sort of the new new mail, uh, which admits to gill feminist, the good man. And if you are

Speaker 2:          00:40          fat Tomcat of a man resting on top of the warm TV, who's, who's, who's, what would you say moral virtue consists in his harmlessness exactly.

Speaker 1:          00:53          What, what's, I mean how, what's the advice to give to, because what I find, I see a lot of men trying to find their way and find out what it means to be a man. And I think that's a lot of them turns to you and a, or a person like Jocko Willink and let, let interviewed you. And because you're, you're, uh, and why do you think that it's, I mean, is it the because it doesn't seem so you, you're not sugarcoating life that you're not giving them

Speaker 2:          01:27          no. Well, the funny thing about, well there's a couple of things that I'm doing that are different from what people usually do. You know, so in the last 20 years, the constant message to young people is self esteem, self esteem, feel good about yourself. It's like, I don't buy that. I think that you look at yourself in the mirror and you think, Jesus Christ, I could be a hell of a lot better than I am. And so, and the thing is there's nothing more complimentary to tell a young person than that. So like, look at you, you're a wreck.

Speaker 2:          01:57          Grow the hell up. There's so much more to you than your manifesting. Then you can hardly imagine it. It's like, well, you think that's a criticism? It's like, no, it's not. It's a great compliment. It's like, look at how much more you could bring out into the world. Get your aggression under control, strengthen yourself. Like take on some responsibilities. See if you have enough bloody courage to tell the truth. Put your life together. Stop whining. Hmm. The man eat that up because no one's ever told them that. Which just makes breaks my heart. Yeah, it's so bad. And you know, the boys are pulling out of everything. They're pulling out a university, they're pulling out of life, they're pulling out of marriage, and, and because of that, they're more awkward and unsophisticated than they would otherwise be in much more prone to make sexual errors, some of which are, you know, predatory malevolence in a small proportion of cases.

Speaker 2:          02:55          But it's another one of those situations, you know, like imagine that one in a hundred men are sexual predators. Yeah, probably. Maybe it's one in 50 but let's go with one in a hundred. Well, they, that small proportion commit all of this sexual predation. Like if you look at criminals, it's a parade. Oh, distribution. Again, 5% of the criminals produce something like, well, the overwhelming majority of the crimes, right? It's a small coterie of specialized people who are responsible for all the criminality. Lots of people are in prison because they did one highness thing, you know, like they got enraged or drunk and did something violent. But there's the serial criminal types and they're the ones that are, they do all, they, they like we had one guy in Toronto for example, who ran a bike theft ring and they finally nailed him. And like there weren't any bikes stolen in Toronto after that. It was just him and his little coterie of, you know, organized bike thieves and these guys that are being outed, the serial predators, they are responsible like one, one spread predatory guy can prey on who knows, 500 females, thousand females in the lifetime, you know. So

Speaker 1:          04:16          it's almost seems like, I mean this is a lot of guys, I was one of these guys who sort of turn away from society for, for awhile, like into computer games, like the slacker identity where, which is sort of, I guess it's always been there like you turned to a like away from all responsibilities, but the opportunities to do this, it's so much Florida now, right?

Speaker 2:          04:47          Yeah. Well, it's, it's the lost boys, like in Peter Pan Right there, it never land and they never grow up. And Peter Pan is their leader. That's, that's the story. And it's not surprising because it's easier to do. It's easier to occupy yourself trivially than it is to do something difficult. So like there's a big tendency in that direction to begin with because it's easier to do nothing than to take responsibility. It's easier to play games than to plan for the future. It's easier to be resentful and angry than it is to be, you know, to shoulder you're vulnerability properly. And then when you add on to that, the idea that if you go out into the world and try to strive forward, that you're nothing but a predatory patriarch, then well, it's just one more. It's just the icing on the cake. You know, I had a friend who was like that he pulled back from the world, um, and bill because he believed that active masculinity was a pathological force.

Speaker 2:          05:50          And um, he poisoned himself terribly because of that. And he committed suicide when he was 40. He hooked an exhaust, you know, up hose onto his exhaust pipe and gassed himself up in the mountains in Alberta. And that was the logical consequence of, of his self hatred. It's like, well, if you're so pathological, why don't you just do it yourself in and hiding like that is, you know, it's not, that's obviously not the full fledged manifestation of that, but, but it's, it's, believe me, it's on the road. So, and so, yeah, I've been talking to all these young guys, they come to my biblical lectures for example, and the message is always the same. It's like stand the hell up. Get the hell out there in the world. Take local responsibility, put yourself together because there's nothing more dangerous than a weak man. And the problem is, is that we're encouraging men to be weak because we have this pathological idea that there's that strength and tyranny or the same thing. And that's that Animus I was talking about earlier though women, it's not only women, but the feminist types, let's say, who insist upon the pathology of the Patriarchy cannot distinguish between competence and power. They see everything because they have this vague and undifferentiated sense of masculinity. They say they see everything that is associated with authority as equivalent to tyranny.
