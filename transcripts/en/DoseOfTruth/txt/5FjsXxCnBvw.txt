Speaker 1:          00:06          I constantly cannot verbalize my thoughts, written and focal regardless of topic and my level of knowledge. Tips for verbalizing, thoughts to get them into writing and therefore speech. Well, what I would say Lauren is do this like read something, put a decide, try to summarize it in writing and talk while you're doing it. And then write down what you say and don't edit while you're doing that. See what are the problems that people have when they're trying to write is they try to write a good sentence. They not only tried to write a sentence, but they try to write a good sentence and you can't do that. You have to write a sentence that's hard enough and then you have to edit it. So allow yourself to write badly. I'm dead serious about this. Like write a bad, bad, bad first draft and then edit it if you get rid of 70% of it.

Speaker 1:          00:59          So what? That's exactly what should happen. So like if you want to write a thousand word essay, you should start by writing a really bad 2000 word essay and then you should get rid of the worst 50% you can do that iteratively. I have a document online. It's, it's, if you go to my website, under courses, there's psychology for 30 is the course. I should make this more public. But under cycle psychology for 30, there's a template for writing. And if you went and looked at that template, it tells you it answers your question. I, I produced this little guide book for, for writing that will help. And if you write enough, you'll learn to speak. The other thing I would say too is that it might be anxiety that's doing, you might think about joining a club like toastmasters or maybe if you're a university student to public speaking, uh, something where you'd get in front of people. And then when you're in front of people, don't talk to the group, talked to the individuals within the group and let yourself be bad at it. You'll get better as you practice.
