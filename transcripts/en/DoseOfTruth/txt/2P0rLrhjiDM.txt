Speaker 1:          00:06          Oh, Rogers was a phenomenologist. It's useful to know what that means because you hear people use words all the time, like why? Maybe not all the time, probably not usually like phenomenology or existentialism, postmodernism and structuralism and all those things. It's not. It's frequently the case that it isn't that easy to figure out what the dark cloud. That's because they don't know. No, because it's actually quite difficult to make a reasonable conceptual distinction between all those different modes of thinking and phenomenology came out of philosophy and its earliest advocate was a guy named Edmund and its most famous proponent was probably heidegger, heidegger garden, lots of trouble because he ended up supporting the Nazis at least to some degree, so that's pretty good reason to get in trouble. All things considered, you know, although you know most people in Germany, so not that's any excuse obviously.

Speaker 1:          01:20          It's hard to exactly get your head around what the phenomenologists are talking about. I was reading about David chalmers this morning. I don't know how many of you know about David Chalmers, but he's a philosopher who started the Tucson conventions on consciousness and chalmers. I'm not sure what I think about gentleman. He's very charismatic. He's got a way with words and setting up those convention center has done a great deal for the study of consciousness. But um, sometimes I think that what he pointed out to scientists was obvious. It was funny, you know, when they're, when psychology was primarily behaviorist, which was back in the fifties, it came as a big shock to psychologists when certain psychologist started to talk about cognition. They called that the cognitive revolution and you know, I think it was obvious to everybody, but psychologists at that point that people fought and I think it was perhaps the same situation with philosophers and it's pretty obvious to everybody that consciousness was a tough nut to crack. But the philosophers kind of ignored it and chalmers brought it back into the academic mainstream. The phenomenologists are really all about consciousness. They just accepted as a fact. I'm rather than trying to deny its existence because it can't be easily reduced to its material. Substrate. Chalmers big point was that he couldn't understand why evolution couldn't have produced creatures exactly like us who have no conscious awareness that you called them, fundamentally said that the existence of consciousness is an enduring mystery.

Speaker 1:          03:07          Well, I think that's true. I don't. I'm not sure that we've got anywhere in terms of figuring out exactly what consciousness is, despite a lot of time and effort put into it and despite a lot of tremendous amount of work done on the brain, but anyways, the phenomenologists are. They just took it as a fact. Now, heidegger believe that western philosophy had lost its way really since the time of the Greeks, and he thought that phenomenology or the philosophies, primary field of focus should be being itself, not reality, but being. And it's not easy to understand what he meant by being, but the phenomenal field. The idea of a phenomenal field somewhat captures it. So for Heidegger, reality was what you experienced. So he sort of, you sort of tip the tables instead of presuming an objective world and then deriving the subjective from it. He presumed that the entirety of your experiences were real and that included your emotions and your felt motivational states and your dreams and your fantasies and even your delusions. Now, that doesn't mean that people like heidegger thought that all the elements of lived reality belonged in the same category, so if you thought that dreams and the reality that you've shared with other people were indistinguishable from one another, you'd be just as pathological to a phenomenologist as to anyone else,

Speaker 1:          04:52          but they were trying to get back to the central mystery of life, which is that there is something rather than nothing. I suppose the neck. We experienced it and that's the place where Roger Starts. One of the presumptions of, of the Rogerian is, is that in order to help someone, you have to put yourself in their shoes fundamentally. So you have to try to see the world from their perspective, and that means adopting the viewpoint. It means adopting the reality that manifests itself to them so that you can develop an empathic understanding, body focused understanding of the person that you're talking to you.
