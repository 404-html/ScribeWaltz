Speaker 1:          00:06          Well, it all started in 2007 when I was lucky enough to have a full on medical level of depression. I'm really, really bad. I talk about it in some sort of detail in the, uh, in the book I realized it's actually a level of which I don't even, I realized I wrote about it with details of my youth. My wife doesn't know. There's a weird privacy thing that sometimes happens when you're talking to know dictating into a computer that you kind of like this just between me and the computer and now I realize it's probably the most public thing, but the thing that saved me, the thing that ultimately helped me deal with my depression in general was cognitive behavioral therapy. I'm, in a sense, it's sort of like applied stoicism. You just look at your own thoughts back to the really exaggerate once you've labeled them as cognitive distortions that these include things like generalization, catastrophizing, binary thinking, thinking, everything has to be there, all good or all bad.

Speaker 1:          00:59          I'm actually particularly guilty of these. Yeah. And Amazingly, if you just actually learn what these distortions are and practice every day to sort of talk back to sort of the more anxious or depressed voices in your own head, it's an incredibly effective treatment for depression, anxiety and it changed, absolutely changed my life. Meanwhile, as this is changing my life, I still work. I'm still the president of fire, which means I defend free speech and due process and academic freedom on campus. And um, and while I was learning all of these intellectual habits, all these ways to sort of talk yourself down, I was looking around at what administrators were doing and saying to myself, wow, it's actually kind of like the administrators are saying, oh by the way, do engage in cognitive distortions, do engage in binary thinking, do overgeneralize and most of all, catastrophizing all the time.

Speaker 1:          01:49          And I remember thinking somebody will be affected as well. Thank goodness the students don't seem to really be buying it. And that's what changed in 2013, 2014 prior to 2013, 2014 since I started in 2001, the worst constituency for free speech on campus was actually administrators best, most reliable fans of free speech you could run into on campus were generally the students themselves. And then sometime around 2013, 2014, we saw a, suddenly there were demanding everything from trigger warnings to microaggression policies to December for even people. But, but both on the left and the right on the spectrum. And it seemed like we said it seemed to happen almost overnight and this and when I went to talk to John About it, now we've become friends through mutual friends. And I said it's almost. I talked about my whole theory that we're teaching a generation the habits of anxious and depressed people from cognitive behavioral therapy.

Speaker 1:          02:45          John got really excited about the idea, um, and asked if I wanted to write about it. And I was already a fan of John's work. So I was like, absolutely. Yeah. So I thought that his, his insight into what had changed was absolutely brilliant. I had just begun to notice this in my own teaching. I'd been teaching since 1995 at University of Virginia originally, and it was seemingly overnight, right around 2014. These new ideas, students, of course, political, they protest, they object to things, but what was new grid? Put his finger on it. What was new was the idea that these words are going to harm me, not just defend me, not just be unjust. Pardon me? We have to protect. It was this idea that students are fragile and need protection and the protection should come from administrators, from adults. That's what was new and disturbing.

Speaker 2:          03:31          Yeah. Will you guys talk in the book about Concept Creep?

Speaker 1:          03:35          Hmm.

Speaker 2:          03:36          The overgeneralization of the idea of trauma. You know, one of the things that's really struck me as interesting about the safe space movement and the microaggression policies and all of that is that it does run so contrary to what every clinician worth his or her salt, those about treating anxiety or depression

Speaker 2:          03:55          and so, so that's kind of a remarkable. A phenomenon in itself is that what we know clinically has been absolutely inverted by people who are hypothetically agitating on the part of students' mental health and it's not as if the mental health community has stood up on moss and denounced this. So. And I also don't. I don't understand that. I also don't understand how we got here. You guys talk in the book a little bit about your little bit of. You hypothesize a little bit about the internet generation. Right? And those were the kids born after 1995. You don't put the finger on the millennials but. But let's talk a little bit about why you think things changed in 2013. In 2014.

Speaker 1:          04:42          Let me just first say your point about these new ideas are not clinically supported. Something that we suggest in the book. We don't know. We don't know if this is going on. To what extent is this a sincere desire for protection and a sincere belief that students are fragile and to what extent is it the pursuing of a political agenda and, and, and making political points and using mental health as a cover? I think both are operative and, and so, and it may depend on the context.

Speaker 2:          05:15          Why do you think the first one is operative? Because this runs so contrary to everything that's known about the actual protection of mental health. I'm very skeptical about attributing a positive motivation to it. Like it seems to me that it's fundamentally driven by resentment.

Speaker 1:          05:33          Well, it's so, uh, so you're absolutely right that the psychological community does not support this, but yet has not stood up very vocally to condemn it. So we are hopeful that psychologist and psychiatrist, everyone we spoke to agreed that wrongly, that's exactly the worst thing to do for someone who suffers from ptsd, is to sweep their daily life of reminders, thereby denying them the chance to, to, to, to the situation, to decondition the, uh, the power of these triggers in the real world.

Speaker 2:          06:11          It's worse in some sense because one of the things you do when you expose people who have anxiety disorders to the things they're anxious about is not make them less anxious but make them more courageous. Yeah. Right. And that's why generalizes because the psychoanalysts thought that exposure would just mean the fears would pop up somewhere else, but they don't and it's because people learn that there's more to them than they thought, and then when you protect them, not only do not expose them, which is a big problem, but you also teach them to generalize the idea of their weakness, which is a really terrible thing to do to people. So you couldn't invent a more counterproductive mental health movement. And instituted on campus is if you set out to design it.

Speaker 1:          06:54          That's something that we always try to emphasize and so interesting for us to look at was the one thing, because you know the third anti free speech movement is coming from students in the relatively recent past, so late eighties and early nineties for example. But the thing that was so striking was that they were medicalizing all, all of these claims, of course, they're sitting there going like, that doesn't sound right. And I talked to John and he was like, that doesn't sound right. And we interviewed for the original article, maybe seven different, the clinical psychologists, cbt experts, uh, you know, for example. And the thing I keep on trying keep on explaining it as it's, as a fraternity of what could be a minor version into something more like a phobia because we're giving it so much more power. And the worst thing of all that we're doing so much of our campuses, we're turning it into a Schema. We're turning the idea that I've broken into, um, into. It's a permanent sort of self definition. So that's why I do think that there's sort of a mixed motive thing going on here. I think that we have a self fulfilling prophecy going on to some degree because I do think that some of this kind of hopeless ideology, he's actually genuinely Harvard students actually making them more anxious and depressed.
