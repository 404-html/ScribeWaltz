Speaker 1:          00:00          Hmm.

Speaker 1:          00:07          If you hold something sacred, then your team's circles around it and it's only those who circled around with you and sometimes literally circled around like Muslims at prayer in Mecca, they literally circle the kebabs. Circling is a very primitive, ancient. It feels right to circle something, but even if even if you do it symbolically or you all bow at the same time that binds you together, children do that with their mothers when they, when they engage in exploratory behavior like, well they use their mother as a center of the world and children differ in the degree to which they'll move outward from their mothers. So they move out until they, they, they trip over their uncertainty threshold. Neat. Is it a distance, like it's a district that is. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. And so, so the more exploratory kids who are lower negative emotion will go out farther before they come back to their mother.

Speaker 1:          00:54          So the mother is the center and you know that that would be associated symbolically with the idea of the center has a motherland or potentially as a father like that's right. That makes sense. So this way that we're, we're incredibly symbolic creatures. We're not just out to make as much money as we can. Where's the symbolic and social creatures and this psychology of sanctity or purity has become really important, not just on the right. It's always been important for especially religious conservatives were beginning to see it even on the campus left, and this is why I think we see some of the odd things we see on campus that the campus must be kept as a sacred and pure space. One of the things that really alarms me about what's happened on campus and last couple of years is that the older idea we had that it's a place for contesting ideas.

Speaker 1:          01:40          It's A. It's a zone of enormous choice. People can take what courses they want, say what they want. It's kind of a wonderful free for all with some with norms of respect. It's now becoming much more of a religious zone where the perimeter of the campus is the boundaries and within it they're almost their blasphemy laws basically. And I really started noticing this. When you look at the videos of the Middlebury, a protest when Charles Murray spoke at Middlebury and as, as everybody knows, he was shouted down so the students are chanting and they're chanting in unison and it seems like a religious revival meeting and they're swaying and they're saying they're sacred, you know, racist, sexist, antigay, Charles Murray go away. It's like a ritual incantation. Um, so that all the space is safe and it's safe and maternal. Not yet. So far all this happening is they're binding together.

Speaker 1:          02:32          They're moving and you know, synchronous movement and call and response. So it's using a lot of tropes from religion and religious worship. But here's the cool thing, when the administrator, I forget who it is, comes on to say, okay, we have moved, we're moving the talk. And then you hear a couple of people screaming up off campus off campus and he says to another location on campus and there's like, oh no, no, because you know, no one had to go to this talk. So everyone could have just stayed at home and the students did succeed in shutting down to venues. They could have declared victory, but it's not a full victory unless he is physically off the campus. We can't have him speaking on campus because that defiles us. That pollutes us. We must shut that down. And that's where I started saying, wow, this is like full blown psychology of religion, Durkheim, sanctity, purity blast for me. And that I think, you know, that doesn't describe most students, but that describes this sort of the core. Those who who really have their identity is wrapped up in this movement.
