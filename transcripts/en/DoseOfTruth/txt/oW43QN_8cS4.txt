Speaker 1:          00:07          Yeah. Books we read to our young children. Well, it depends on how young, really young. There's this book called how to teach your child to read in a hundred easy lessons, all type that. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:26          no, I've done something technical. It's called how to teach. I mean, something technically poor your child to read in 100 easy lessons. That is an excellent book because you can actually teach your child to read in a hundred easy lessons. Very smart, very, very smart book. Very well developed psychologically older kids. I really liked the Harry Potter books. I think that rolling nailed the mythological structure. Um, what else? I mean, I'm in collaboration with my daughter. I'm putting together a reading list for young people for, for kids and young adults. So I guess I'll have to answer it that way.
