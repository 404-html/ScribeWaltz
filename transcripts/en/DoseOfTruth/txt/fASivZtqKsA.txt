Speaker 1:          00:09          So, and I also think, and I think this is laid out very thoroughly in the biblical stories as well, is that if there are enough people who are admirable, then things work and if there aren't and things, things are terrible, you get wiped out. You remember when Abraham is bargaining with God with regards to Sodom and Gomorrah, he asks God to save the city. If there's like 40 admirable people, right? Respectable, let's say admirable, right? I don't want it, I don't want to say good because good is being corrupted in some sense. By casual usage. I mean admirable noble people, right? Yeah. I think Abraham bargains God down to like 10 if there's 10 of them in the city, the city won't be destroyed. And that, that's not very many in this city. So there's an interesting idea there, which is the there. There doesn't have to be that many people in a group who have their act together, but zero is the wrong number.

Speaker 1:          01:05          And if it's zero then then we're seriously in trouble. And I think that goes along with the idea of the pareto principle in economics too, which is that it's a small minority of people who do most of the productive work in any given domain. But so, so a small number of, of properly behaving people might have enough of an impact to keep everything moving. And that might also, they might actually be true, but it can't fall below some crucial level. And I do think that we're in some danger of allowing it to fall below some crucial level because our society seems to be at war in some ways against the idea of the individual and individual character per se. And I think that's absolutely right.
