Speaker 1:          00:06          And so not only do you need the value structure so that you don't just deteriorate and die. You need the value structure so that when the flood comes in your life as it certainly will, that you have built a vessel that will sustain you through the catastrophe and that's not this pursuit of happiness. It's not even the pursuit of security. It's none of that. It's the orientation that you've managed to produce in your own life towards a higher good that's so high that it's worth bearing the burden of being to produce. You implement that in the world. You produce a hierarchy. Now you might say, well, and then you have the problem of hierarchy in the problem of hierarchy is a very few people are going to be very good at whatever that hierarchy does and then you have the second problem with hierarchy, which is the problem I just laid out when I asked you about your spectacular levels of attainment and found out that they were very, it was very unlikely.

Speaker 1:          01:04          I'm not saying that you haven't detained worthwhile things. That's not my point. My point is, is that very high levels of attainment are extraordinarily rare. And that's an inevitability. As soon as you decide that something's worth doing to inevitabilities, people stack up at the top minority of people stack up at the top and take most of the proceeds, whatever they happen to be or deserve them or earn them, whatever. However, I don't care how you conceptualize it and almost everybody else stacks up at the bottom. And so the problem with hierarchies is that even though they're necessary, they tend to produce a situation where most people stack up at the bottom. And so that's the next thing that we have to contend with. You can't get rid of the hierarchies because if you get rid of the hierarchies, there's no value structure. And if there's no value structure, not only do you deteriorate and die, you want to deteriorate and die, and that's not a good solution.

Speaker 1:          01:58          But if you do generate a hierarchy, then you have the problem of the hierarchy. And the problem is the hierarchy is that it will dispossess most people now to the degree that the postmodernists have something to say, that's what they say is hierarchies. Dispossess okay. And then we can look at that clearly and carefully. And we can say that doesn't mean a, that hierarchies themselves are corrupt or that we can dispense with them. But it also doesn't mean that we have no moral obligation to the dispossessed. And we say, well, how do we deal with that politically, conceptually. And the way we deal with that, at least in part, is to produce a political spectrum that ranges from left to right that deals with hierarchy and the problems that hierarchies because so one of the things that you can reliably assume about someone who's on the right is that they will be patriotically in favor of the current hierarchy or even more abstractly, they're in favor.

Speaker 1:          02:59          The idea of hierarchy itself. And you say, well, more power to the people on the right because you need hierarchies. So they should support them. But then you have to take the people on the left who say, yeah, but what about the people who are dispossessed by the hierarchy? And what you have to say to them is, yeah, we actually have to do something about that. And you think, well, how did we do something about that? And the answer is we don't actually know because there's no permanent solution to the problem of dispossession by the hierarchy. We don't know how to fix it. You say, well, we could flatten the hierarchies. It's like not without disrupting the value structure. That's a price you don't want to pay. Well, we could take from the top and put it at the bottom. It's like, yes, hypothetically we could.

Speaker 1:          03:49          But it turns out that when you try that in practice, it's very, very easy to rapidly go too far. And then what you end up with not is less dispossessed. You end up with no one who has anything. And that's not a good solution to the problem of scarcity, right? To make everyone equally dead or equally starving, which is essentially what the communists states did across the entirety of the 20th century is not the proper way to address the problem of hierarchy. Now it has to be addressed even if you're on the right because here's one thing that happens. Hierarchies tend to Ossify, you know, because what happens is that the people at the top, maybe they got there by merit, but it's easy for them to Gerrymander the system so they can stay there without merit. Or perhaps their children can stay there without merit or they can, or the hierarchy becomes corrupt so that people who only use tyranny and power can climate, and so you don't have a hierarchy of competence and value anymore.

Speaker 1:          04:53          You have a hierarchy of brute power, which looks like a tyranny, and so there's all sorts of ways that hierarchies can deteriorate and we have to be awake to ensure that that doesn't occur. Also, if the hierarchy gets so steep that everybody stacks up at zero and no one can climb it, which is basically the definition of a malfunctioning tyranny than all the people at the bottom rightly think, well, why don't we just destroyed the game because we're already at zero? So what the hell do we have to lose? And so one of the things that you want to do if you're a sensible conservative, is make sure that the hierarchy maintains its rooting in competence, that it's transparent and that it's climate bowl. Because otherwise it will also Phi and steepen and then it will destroy itself. And if you're a conservative and you value stability and the hierarchy, then you don't want to set up a situation where the most likely outcome is that the hierarchy destroys itself.

Speaker 1:          05:52          So, so we can be intelligent about this. We could say, look, don't be thinking can get rid of hierarchies they've been around. This is why I wrote chapter one I talked about lobsters. The reason I talked about them is because not only is the hierarchical structure itself as a permanent feature of existence, at least a third of a billion years old, which by the way means that you cannot attribute it to capitalism, the free market or the corrupt patriarchal west, unless you're willing to make the case that all three of those elements contributed to the existence of dominance hierarchies among crustaceans, which seems highly unlikely. So, and, and this is actually something that's, that you can think about it as an idea that's actually directed towards the productive left. If you want to help the dispossessed, don't blame the existence of hierarchies on capitalism because it's wrong.

Speaker 1:          06:51          It's wrong that the problem is way deeper than that. And here's something else that's very interesting about capitalism. Couple of things you might consider, you know, we have become spectacularly wealthy since 1895 right? First in the West Icelands at classic example. I mean you guys are so much more wealthy than you were a hundred years ago that it's absolutely impossible to believe. And so that's first happened in the west to exponential economic growth starting in about 1895 there's a long tail. I mean, people were improving before that, but it really kicked in around 1895 and first happened in the west and now it's happening everywhere in the world. I don't know if you know this, but you know, um, the UN set a goal in 2000 to have the level of absolute poverty in the world by 2015 which is the fastest rate of economic growth ever recorded. We attained it in 2012, three years ahead of the most optimistic projections.

Speaker 1:          07:46          Right? And so people are being lifted out of poverty at a rate that has never been seen in the history of the world hooked to the power grids provided with cell phones provided with free, with access to fresh water provided with access to medications that decrease child mortality. Like if you look at the statistics, there are so many things getting better so fast you cannot even believe it. And that's, and here's that's a consequences as far as, as far as the data indicate of the operation of the free market system, which does produce inequality. That's the thing. But as far as I can tell, the only system that has ever produced wealth and as law or has every system produces inequality, but the only system we know of that produces, produces wealth and inequality is the free market. So here's a question for everyone left and right.

Speaker 1:          08:38          How many units of inequality will you tolerate to produce one unit of wealth? And if the answer is zero, then you've gone too far. You're outside the appropriate political debate. That's the wrong answer. And if you try to impose all there will be as mayhem because the price we pay for wealth is inequality. Now that doesn't mean that you can let inequality run to its ultimate extreme because then you run into the other problem, which is the monopoly problem. You've all played monopoly. I presume what happens in every monopoly game, if you lay it out, everyone's stacks out at zero, zero except one person. Now if you play it 50 times, you'll find that it's hardly ever the same person because it's basically a game of chance and there's a fair bit of chance, by the way, operating in the distribution of money in the world.

Speaker 1:          09:30          It's not all chance, but there's a fair bit of chance. But the logical conclusion to a hierarchy that can play itself out totally is that one person has everything and everyone else has nothing. Obviously that's not a useful outcome. So, so you know, the way there are ways that we fix that in our society, we have progressive tax policies and you can argue about their utility, but that's one way of rectifying it potentially. Another way of rectifying is that we don't have one game right? In a pluralistic society, we have many, many games that people can play. And so if you can't be a successful lawyer, then maybe you could be a successful plumber. And if you can't be a successful plumber, maybe you can run this small restaurant or you know, there's a diversity of games. And so that's a good way of, of allowing, of, of increasing the robustness of the system so that you don't get hierarchies that are so steep that they collapse in and, um, in an, in an, in upon themselves.

Speaker 1:          10:27          And so those are sophisticated approaches and perhaps your other approach is to, but it's an intractable problem. It says in the New Testament, it's one of the things you'd swear would be edited out because it's such a harsh statement. The poor will be with us always. Well, what's that in reference to? It's also in reference to the Matthew principle, which is another new testament statement and happens to be an economic axiom to those who have everything more will be given from those who have nothing. Everything will be taken. That's the structure of the world and you can't lay it at the feet of the West. It's the structure of the world now. That means we have to contend with it. And it's not an easy thing to contend with. And part of the reason that we have a continual political dialogue and that we need to have a continual political dialogue, is to make sure that our hierarchies exist and remain intact, but don't become so steep and corrupt that they destroy themselves. And you need a left and a right for that. And if and, but that means the left half has to admit that hierarchies are not only necessary but valuable. And the right has to admit that despite their necessity in value, they tend to stack people up at the bottom. And that actually constitutes a continual problem.
