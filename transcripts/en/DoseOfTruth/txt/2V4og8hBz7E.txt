Speaker 1:          00:06          There are a variety of very complex things facing us and one of them is called the Iq issue that we talked about. Another is this polarization between left and right. That seems to be characterizing everywhere in the West, you know, it's the same in Australia, New Zealand, all through Europe, in Canada, in the US. I think you guys are actually a little more protected against the most places. But um, and then the other one is, well we need a dialogue between Islam and Christianity and Judaism for that matter. But I mean the big, the big clash for, for the Western world is, is Islam versus Christianity and you know, people don't think about it in those terms because many intellectuals in the west think of themselves as secular, but it's a massive, it's a massive problem. And I'm hoping to conduct a whole series of conversations with, with Muslims, a former and present pro and anti to try to facilitate a dialogue because there's lots to talk about.

Speaker 1:          01:08          I mean, I've studied religious thinking a lot and I'm pretty ignorant about Islam because it's complicated system and it's difficult to get into. But I can tell you that what I've read about Islam has not made me feel better about the chances of reconciliation between the Christian and the Islamic world. So like I don't know what to make of the fact, for example, I mean if you look at the figure of Christ and I don't care if you're religious or not, and I don't even care a Christ existed or not, and I certainly don't care at the moment about claims to divinity or the lock there up. I'm just speaking as let's say I'm speaking as a secondary intellectual mean as a figure. He's a figure of peace. I don't think that that's disputable. I mean, he certainly, he wasn't a war Lord. That's one thing.

Speaker 1:          02:01          That's for certain he never led armies, you know, whereas that's not the case with Mohammed at all. Muhammad was clearly and indisputably a war Lord. And so it isn't the obvious to me what to make of that except that it's bloody complicated. Had a child bride as well, I believe. Yeah. Well, that one is somewhat less problematic to me because I think that you can write that off to the cultural mores of the time. Now I'm. I know that there's a weakness in that, but I don't think we have to address that, but the wind, the founder of your religion spread that religion by the sword. It makes it rather difficult and when your religion has been embroiled in a vicious civil war from the day of Mohammed's death, which is exactly the case in Islam between the Sudanese and the and the Shiites, that war started literally the day that Mohammed died. It's very difficult for me to see how that could be reconciled with the claims that Islam is a religion of peace.

Speaker 2:          03:05          Yeah. We solved that one when Martin Luther hammered some stuff on a door a long time ago and the Protestants and the Catholics just went their separate ways and I mean there's been some rough feelings over the years I suppose, but no generational wars that I can think of. I mean, right.

Speaker 1:          03:22          Yeah. Well, I mean there was plenty, you know, as you said, there were. There's been plenty of Christian schism, but the other thing too is that it's not that easy to lay those at the feet of Christ. No, because because just even merely as an archetypal figure, you know, as, as, as, as the western world's hypothesis of the ideal man. I mean, as a moral character, he was pretty much above reproach and I don't. Well, it's difficult for me to say the same thing about Muhammad now. That might be because I'm an ignorant all western white guy, but like I'm doing my best man. I'm a big buyer of Taoism for example, and there's great wisdom in Taoism and I've found value real value in, in so much of the religious reading that I, that I've done, but I'm really stumbling with Islam. It's really hard for me to, to see it as other than a primarily political system

Speaker 2:          04:23          and did. And that's how it's being imply enforced right now with wwe, that's what Isis is all about. Their estate establish a religious caliphate, you know, across the borders of two, two countries. It's, it's less about. When I think of religion, when I think of the Christian religion and how it's applied here in my home state of Georgia, you know, it's when, when, when we go to church and we tie, that has very little to do with politics at all. There's, there's, there's this huge, massive separation between religion and politics for the most part in the US and to be, there are moments of ambiguity and, and tempers flare over and I'm a monument on this piece of property or no, but that's as stiff as it gets. Like, like the scariest bit of that that I can remember. Some drunk fellow ran over a monument or the 10 commandments a few months ago and tipped it over. Like, like, like that's what happens when

Speaker 3:          05:12          I agree to your point, like if you're not a Christian Kyle and you're, you know, Christian kind of alcove there in Georgia, no one ever is going to come to you and say you have to pay a different rate of taxes. You have to go to different stores. You have the religious law will not be enforced

Speaker 2:          05:28          as a law. You know, I'm not gonna lose any hands. Uh, if I, if I, I can, you know, the Bible has many restrictions that it places on Christians and I ignore all of them virtually, you know, like, but I don't, I know there's no, like there's no religious police to come and kick my door in and drag me away and torture me and threatened my family and, and.

Speaker 1:          05:50          Well, let me, it's also, there's other, there's other cataclysms that are on the that exist on the conceptual, the conceptual realm as well. So you know, the, the, the state's dominated by Islam are not economically productive and that's quite an interesting mystery and they're not. And many of the many of the Islamic states that we purport to regard as allies hold values that are antithetical to our system and a, Saudi Arabia is a classic example of that. And I cannot for the life of me understand, except in a psychoanalytic matter why the radical feminists tolerate America's ally. America's lie. The fact that America is allied with the Saudis, it's just absolute. It's like, it's like it's not much different as far as I'm concerned that it would be if black people didn't say anything. If America was allied with a slave owning a black slave owning state, which of course also happens in Saudi Arabia by the way, and not

Speaker 3:          07:00          so when did the feminist. It's gotta be because Muslims right now are higher up on the victim hierarchy than then, so even if it's way over there, they're not allowed to speak out against them.

Speaker 1:          07:10          I think it's their unconscious wish for brutal male domination.

Speaker 2:          07:17          No, I like that. That's fun. I think it's the left's ability to apologize for anything that's wrong. I think the people on the left, and maybe I'm just as crazy as you guys are, like I said, the Muslims are oppressed women. Oh, that's cultural. We need to understand that. Oh guys think they're girls that you know, hey, we need to understand where they're coming from. Everything. They're so open minded to it, even if it's horrific. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          07:42          That's also the agreeableness say that we were talking about earlier. Yeah, because agree, agreeable people agree, you know, that's why the term exists and yeah, so there is a real apology and if you ally that with high openness, which is that open mindedness, you know, that that's associated activity, you get agreeable openness and yeah, that's definitely.

Speaker 2:          08:04          And then it even goes, I'll call and I'll forgive you beating your wife and if you're low in conscientiousness, everything keeping really goes. Then Bill Moore puts it nicely when he says, you know, the lift would not for one second be okay with apartheid in South Africa, right? They were just banging that drum hating every second of the way, but for some reason the oppression of women in Saudi Arabia has gotten a complete pass. Yup. And it's a real deal. You know, what the heck? Just the driving thing alone. Taylor, can you hold it that they liked her? Yeah, I broke up. You broke that. We couldn't hear what you were saying that you're still a little frozen. So, um, uh, but yeah, just taking away their ability to drive. Right? Women don't have mobility without men. That is hugely oppressive. If you made that change in America and none other than our wellness stuff, dude,

Speaker 1:          09:04          you actually don't see a more concrete embodiment of the idea of individual autonomy than the automobile. You know, I think maybe it was the Soviet Union's import and then, and then, uh, a manufacturer if the automobile, the doom, communism because nothing screams autonomous individual like a car, right? You will derive it yourself. You can go on any road. No one tells you what to do. It's like it's freedom. And the fact that women can't drive in Saudi Arabia, it tells the entire story. And so the fact I cannot understand for the life of me why we are so blind in the west, that we make the assumption that those people are our allies. Like in what way?
