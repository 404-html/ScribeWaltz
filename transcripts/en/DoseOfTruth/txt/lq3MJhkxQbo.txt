Speaker 1:          00:02          Oh this observe one another. They observe people and they represent what they see and they transmit the message of what they see to us and they teach us to see, and we don't necessarily know what it is that we're learning from them, but we're learning something. Or at least we're acting like we're learning something. We go to movies, we watch stories, we, we, we, we immerse ourselves in fiction constantly. That's an artistic production. And for many people, the world of the arts is a living world. And that's particularly true if you're a creative person and it's the creative, artistic people that do move the knowledge of humanity forward. And they do that with their artistic productions first. They're on the edge and the dancers do that. And the poets do that. And the visual artists do that in the musicians do that and we're not sure what they're doing.

Speaker 1:          00:48          Like we're not sure what musicians are doing, what the hell are they doing? Why do you like music? You know, it gives you deep intimation of the significance of things and no one questions it. You go to a concert, you're thrilled. It's a quasi religious experience, particularly if the people really get themselves together and get the crowd moving. You know, there's something incredibly intense about it, but it makes no sense whatsoever. It's not an easy thing to understand. Music is deeply patterned and I, and patterned in layers. And I think that has something to do with it because reality is pattern and deeply patterned in layers. And so I think music is representing reality in some fundamental way, and that we get into the sway of that and sort of participate in being, and that's part of what makes it such an uplifting experience, but we don't really know that's what we're doing. We just go do it. And, and, and, and it's nourishing for people, right? I mean, young people in particular that lots of them live for music. It's where they derive all their meaning, their cultural identity, everything that's nourishing comes from their affiliation with their music is part of their cultural identity. So that's an amazing thing.
