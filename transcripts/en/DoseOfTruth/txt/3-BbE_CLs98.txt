Speaker 1:          00:07          Hi Dr Peterson, thanks for coming. My question is a little bit off topic from everything else tonight, but I really wanted to hear what you had to say about it. Um, I work in residence life here at UBC and in the community where I am. We were recently effected by a suicide of someone who lived in our community and I was upset about it, not just because obviously it's a horrible thing to have happen, but also because res life in the university, like they talk all this talk about like self care and your mental health is so important to us. But then things like this still happened. So I wanted to know like if you think like, what do you think the university should be doing to keep stuff like this from happening in the future?

Speaker 2:          00:54          Well,

Speaker 1:          00:58          it's not self evident that it's the university's responsibility and the reason for that. I'm not saying it isn't. Okay, I'm saying it's not self evident that it is because different institutions can only do so many things, you know? And, and we were already requiring the universities to educate and to act as substitute parents. Increasingly. And to take on the role of judge, jury and executioner as there are more, what should be criminal cases are being handled within the university. Say,

Speaker 2:          01:35          um,

Speaker 1:          01:40          having said that, you could ask the broader question is, well, what do you do to help people be sufficiently in love with life so that they don't wish to end it now? And I've tried to puzzle through that for a long time and that's partly why I've written the things that I've written. It's partly why I've produced the online programs that I've produced. No one. So we know that if you do, if you have students do the future authoring program, for example, they're much less likely to drop out of university about 30 percent less likely and their grades go up. And that's especially true if they're male and marginalized. It has a bigger impact on those communities. And so, you know, I've tried to get universities interests now the data's there, but they're not. And it's very difficult to get a big bureaucracy to move.

Speaker 1:          02:25          A big, big is immobile. So I'm not sure there's anything they can really do about it. It's certainly possible that the things that they're trying to do about it or making it worse. Yeah. That's another thing that you learn if you're a good social scientists, just like there was evidence, and I don't know if this is still the case, but, but there was good evidence. I looked into this about 15 years ago. Say you want to prevent suicides or suicide hotline in your town and you advertise it. What happens? Suicide rate goes up because you're advertising suicide, right? And lots of lots of interventions are like that. It's really, really hard to make things better and it's really, really easy to make them worse. And so that's another problem. You get these big bureaucracies, let's say, and there hypothetically motivated by positive intentions and I would say hypothetically, again, because it takes an awful lot of work to help someone straightened out. It's no joke, especially if they're in real trouble and they put in place these structures that are designed to help but they don't ever evaluate them and they could easily be making it worse. So.

Speaker 1:          03:37          So I don't have a straightforward answer to that question.

Speaker 2:          03:40          Um, I think that.

Speaker 1:          03:44          Well, that's, that's the only answer I have. Yeah.
