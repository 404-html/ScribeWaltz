Speaker 1:          00:00          Right,

Speaker 1:          00:07          so there was a new article, I think it was published in nature, I'll try to find the link for it. It's about a year old that, that was based on high resolution imaging of new connections. It's actually reviewed and Kurt Sal's Kurzweil's book. How to build a mind. I think that's the name of it. Um, and so it turns out that the Cortex is made out of these columnar structures that are pre-organized units of neurons and they're replicated across the entire cortex. Basically the same structure. And like the, the, the older, let's say connectionist idea was that neurons that fire together wire together, right? That, that's happened. Of course that's pretty standard neurology, but the, the columns are already pre wired, so it's actually columns that fire together, wire together, but there's. But there's even more with the high resolution scanning. So it turns out that underneath the columnar structure, there are these prebuilt highways that are connected, connective tissue that are pre, pre prepared.

Speaker 1:          01:04          So the columns have the option to connect to the, to the underlying highway, and that highway can connect other columns. So it's as if implicit in the brain organization, and this is at the cortical level, say nothing of subcortical organization, there's already preexistent uh, uh, likelihoods that certain neurons will fire wire together. Yeah. So, and, and what else is cool is that this is actually architecturally quite a regular. So they found that the, these superhighways arranged in lines and, and, and, and in, at right angles to one another. So it's almost like a three dimensional structure of why your cubes that underlies the neuronal structure. So that's some neurological evidence for the archetypal idea.
