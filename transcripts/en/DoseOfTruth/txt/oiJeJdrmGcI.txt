Speaker 1:          00:06          I don't know if you've seen the sort of ridiculous a animation to be used animated drawings like the ginger, the genderbread person or the gender Unicorn.

Speaker 2:          00:17          Yeah, yeah, yeah. I have.

Speaker 1:          00:20          Yeah, and so those are being pushed forward very hard in institutions all across Canada, elementary schools, junior high schools, the military, the police, you name it, where there's this tremendous emphasis on the social construction of identity and it's as if the social constructionists have taken to the law to enforce what they cannot prove scientifically what they failed to prove scientifically or what's even being disproved scientifically, which would be more accurate way of thinking about it. Then the fact that there was an all out assault on, on biology by the left is unbelievably. I'm ominous in my estimation.

Speaker 2:          00:56          Yeah, I agree. Just two things on that. We've got an article coming out on written by two evolutionary psychologists on the false dichotomy between sex and gender and they give it some historical context. So the fault. That false dichotomy I think started with Moonee. Yes, exactly. And it's. And then it was weaponized by feminists to deny biology entered denied sex differences. Basically. So that's it.

Speaker 1:          01:32          Very strange thing for feminists to do. One of the things that James Demore has just pointed out lately, he's the guy that wrote that memo for Google, is that the problem with denying the sex differences is that you automatically make the argument that if there are sex differences, essentially they're making the argument that the female differences or something like inferior because why would you object to their existence otherwise? And memo was actually quite careful because he said, well we should take a look at these differences and if we want to maximize the economic utility of women, which seems to be a reasonable thing to do, then we should actually have a serious discussion about what the differences are and see if we could set up our institution so that we can take advantage of the, of the difference in perspective and orientation. But the two sexes might bring to bear on the, on the workplace and on economic issues in general. And you don't use that happening because people are starting to sort themselves out into occupations bisects essentially. And you know, the longterm social consequences of that aren't obvious. And we don't know how to balance that, but it's, it doesn't, it isn't necessarily the case that it's a bad thing.

Speaker 2:          02:47          No. Yeah. And my position has always been that women have probably more to lose when sex differences are denied. I think because of women's biological clock and the, the fact that we bear much more of a burden when it comes to child bearing and child weary. If you denied that women pay a huge price, if, if you denied the fact that what women go through that to bear children. Firstly, I think we need to separate mothers out from women. There's this sort of a conflation when we talk about things like the gender gap where there's a lot of the rhetoric implies that all women are discriminated against the women who pay a penalty, our mothers and we, we need to talk about that more and we, we shouldn't minimize the, the work and the sacrifice and, and all of the, the, the, the costs and the energy that we've been pouring into that. And I think when we do ny sex differences, we sort of, um, we, we do, we minimize and we, um, sort of dismiss everything that women do that is female normally receive, such as caring and, and, and working for others and sacrificing pay for their children. And you know, all of these things.

Speaker 1:          04:22          Right. Well, no, I agree with you. Maybe a month ago we were talking to her last night. She's trying to finish up her degree. She's also had some health problems that have interfered with that. You know, she was talking to us last night about that. She looked tired. She had bags under her eyes. I mean she's very happy to have the baby and it's going very well and all of that. But the first year after you have a baby, you're basically done. You don't get it. You don't get any sleep. You're absolutely overwhelmed, especially for the first six months with a new instance, especially if you're a first time mother because like, what the hell do you know about taking care of this incredibly complicated thing. And it produces all sorts of biochemical changes and it's really hard on your body and there's a long recovery period and you're much more dependent on your familial structure than you were before.

Speaker 1:          05:10          And the, I like, I like, I mean, it's crazy that we even have to have this conversation, but I like your distinction between women and mothers and you know, there's one of the problems that I've had with, with classic feminism, if you could use that term, is that there's absolutely no respect built into it for the maternal role. And I really think that that's, that's appalling on a variety of levels, including appalling for men because like one of the things I've experienced is that I've had a pretty intense career. I would say. I've been very fortunate in that manner. I've had a lot of familial support and support from my wife for that. And you know, we kind of parsed our life up in a relatively traditional manner because she was quite interested in having children by the time we got together. And um, I was perfectly willing to go along with artists if I could also continue what are my career pursuits, which were also necessary for our financial stability.

Speaker 1:          06:07          But for me, like the domestic realm has been an incredibly meaningful part of my life. Like I, I, I'm really happy in my marriage and blast I would say in my marriage. And I loved having kids and, and for me, my home has always been a refuge from, from the insanity of the world in some sense. And I think our society is, it's so crazily skewed towards public performance, let's say that we've denied the utility of the domestic sphere and that really is terrible for women because especially with regards to kids because that is their, that is the role that they dominate, let's say, or, or Dominique did they contribute most mightily to, let's put it that way. And it, it's almost as if our society regardless, that is kind of an emphasis on, you know. And I think it's crazy. I think it makes people miserable.

Speaker 2:          07:04          And I understand why the early feminists sort of downplayed the domestic sphere because they, they were trapped in the domestic sphere and they wanted opportunities and I'm a, I'm one of those women who would have been an early feminist probably because I crave intellectual stimulation and I would have been, if I'd never had an opportunity to have a career, I would have been bored and that kind of thing. But now in 2017 I can go and get a job as a psychologist that can run a website and, you know, I can do everything that a man can, but I'm still biologically a female. And so when it comes to having kids, a cost is on me and the women in my life, for example, um, my, my own mother who super maternal and comes and helps with the children. I see how we don't keep that status and prestige anymore. And it's, it's just this a male normative sphere where you can monetize something or something, like you said, public performance. We can, we afford that status and prestige. But this invisible caring work that women are so good at. And some women are exceptional that it's supported, no prestige whatsoever. There's often not

Speaker 1:          08:26          you know, or notice for little kids, for example, even though our little kids were very well behaved, that she was treated, she wasn't treated well in the public sphere, she wasn't treated well in restaurants. I think people were afraid. I think that was part of it in some sense. You know, they were afraid that if she showed up in a public place with children that there would be disruption of one form or another. So, but it was certainly the case that I would say she received the opposite of respect and look deeply into architect will symbolism and the function that it plays in. Of course, one of the divine images that sits at the bottom of western culture and Western culture is the image of the divine mother and the mother of the savior of humanity, which is an archetypal idea because every baby has the possibility of growing up to be a redemptive figure.

Speaker 1:          09:13          Now that's, that's the reason that that's an archetypal figures because any society that doesn't worship but so to speak doesn't give it a very high value, will nourish. Now the fact if the declining, the catastrophic declining birth rate in the West is a real example of our willful blindness towards that sacred image and it's a big problem and it is the case that I think if, if the, if the feminists we're actually working on behalf of femininity, which is essentially what they claim, that they would be working a hell of a lot harder to elevate the status of mothers. You know? Yeah. Other than women, I think that's a really good distinction that you're drawing. Even though it seems rather self evident, it's, it's not, and you're not the same. Once you become a mother, you're a different sort of person. And I also think women who don't have children or rather intimidated and afraid of that, and that's perfectly understandable because it isn't radical transformation.

Speaker 1:          10:10          But I would also say, and I've thought this for years, that you don't actually become mature. You don't actually become an adult until you have children. And I know that that's a statement that irritates the hell out of people, but it's something that I stand by it. You're not an adult until someone else matters more than you do. And to make real sacrifices. Yes, exactly. Well, and especially as a mother, you sacrifice yourself as the person of prime importance and, and, and you know, you, you do it, I suppose happily in some sense because generally you fall in love with your baby relatively rapidly and thank God for that because their lots of trouble. Um, you know, I was recounting the story of my daughter and she is trying to. She was planning to take a course in biology online this, this semester in order to move towards the completion of her degree. And we told her last, she said she was overwhelmed when we went and talked to her last night and we told her just to leave it be because first year is so intense that you're, you're completely overwhelmed by it. And it's necessary because you want to get your baby off to a good start and get that relationship functioning properly.
