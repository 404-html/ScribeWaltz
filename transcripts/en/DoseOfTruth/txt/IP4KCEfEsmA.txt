Speaker 1:          00:06          I wrote a book from 1984 to 1999 called maps of meaning and a lot of the things I talk about come out of all the reading I did during that period because I was reading an insane amount and thinking really nonstop 16 hours a day. Like the only way I could stop myself from thinking was to go work out with weights. I couldn't shut off by my concern with the issues that I was dealing with and I was spending about three hours a day writing and I did that everyday for 15 years and that was the consequences. That was the book. And the writing also helped a tremendous amount because it helps clarify your thinking, writing, you know, because actually you're smarter when you, right? Because you can externalize your thoughts and then you can, you can use your working memory to analyze what you've written instead of remembering the thought. And so you're, you're externalizing your memory. You can analyze what you thought, you can refine it, you can reorder it. You can edit like mad with a word processor, which is also a very new thing to it. Editing is very difficult. If you have to do that with pen and paper with a typewriter, it's like, forget it. You, you get your first draft and that's it.
