Speaker 1:          00:06          Jobs are just disappearing. Now let's ask the question. Is there anything that could be done about that? Well, your Western society is tried very hard with a number of environmental environmentally based interventions, early childhood education. By the way that you said the. The literature in organizational psychology is very clear. The winter jury is equally clear in educational psychology. Oh yeah. Well the relationship between Iq and learning is more powerful than the relationship between Iq job performance, that that's right, which is kind of common sense or matches are common sense, but you know, if you put a bunch of variables into a regression equation to predict academic achievement and you have all these variables and teacher quality variables and cognitive variables of the students and what you find is the teacher variables and the quality of the school variables to gather barely account for 10 percent and I know, I know.

Speaker 1:          01:16          It's terrible. It was terrible. You know what I told? He's the guy who ran admissions at Harvard. I taught at Harvard for a while. His name was dean with law and he is a really smart guy. I really liked the, and you know, he was, let's say he was on the right side of the human race and he was really trying to figure out how to run the admissions policy at Harvard so that it did the best for everyone concerned and he had run an interesting series of analysis that I don't believe he ever published. And one of them was um, well let's say you segregate the Harvard population into the relatively low Iq kids. So maybe they only have an Iq of 130, you know, and the relatively high Iq kids who were pushing up towards 160. So you are two competing hypotheses. Fair one would be that the lower Iq kids come to Harvard, this remarkable environment and they, and they and they, they thrive because of the high educational quality so well that they close the gap between them and the one 60 kids. And that's just completely, completely wrong. What happens is you put both those groups, they're both very, very highly selected, but some, you know, in this, in a sort of superman rage intellectually. And what happens is the gap just gets bigger and bigger as they progress through university. And it's a dreaded example of that, uh, matthew principle that the economists talk about, which is no to those who have more will be given. And from those who have nothing, everything will be taken.
