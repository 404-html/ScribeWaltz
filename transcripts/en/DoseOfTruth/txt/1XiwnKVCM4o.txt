Speaker 1:          00:00          You your, you wrote your amcap cause you want to go to medical school, right? And so now the envelope comes and you're shaking away and the open and it's like you got 25th percentile just like a quarter of the people who take the test. Well what, what does that mean? Well this is Sir all blown to hell. That's for sure. And so God only knows how many of these things are going to go to. Maybe your study habits really need to be, you know, you have to reconstitute yourself all the way down to the level of your habits. It's, it can be devastating news. Now, one of the ways to protect yourself against something like that, it's like don't have one plan, right? If you're going to stake yourself on something, you should throw a couple of alternative scaffolds up beside you so that you have somewhere to go.

Speaker 1:          00:43          You want to be a doctor? Okay, well you could be a nurse. It's like it's not a doctor, but it needs cutting your throat. You're still doing 80% of what you wanted to do. So you want to and you want to think about this during your whole life, man, if you're going to take a high risk, you want to scaffold yourself and other areas so that if it fails, you don't bother them, doesn't drop out and you die. And it's also very much worth thinking about with regards to setting up your life in general. It's like if you concentrate solely on your career, you can get along way in your career and I would say that that's a strategy that a minority of men preferentially do that that's all they do. They worked like 70 80 hours a week. They go flat out on their career.

Speaker 1:          01:28          They're staking everything on the small probability of exceptional status in a narrow domain. But it's, it's hard on them. They don't have a life. It's very difficult for them to have a family. They don't know how to take any leisure activity like they get very one dimension. Now it may be that that unit dimentionality is the price you have to pay to be exceptional at one thing, right? Because if you're going to be something like a genius level mathematician and you want to do that for, or a scientist say, it's like you're in your lab, you're in your lab all the time, you're working 70 hours a week or 80 hours a week, you're smart, you're dedicated, you're unit dimensional. And that's how you get to beat all the other people who are doing that. It's the only way. But the problem is you don't get a life.

Speaker 1:          02:11          Now, if you love being a scientist and you have that kind of focus of mind, well first of all, you're a rare person and second you're going to pay for it, but fine. More power to you. But, but it's, uh, it's a risky business to do that. You sacrifice a lot for it. You know? And I would say most often if you're speaking about having a healthy life, that isn't what you do. You spread yourself out more. So, you know, you have a family, you have some things that you do outside of work that are meaningful to you and useful. You, you have a network of friends. Um, that, that those three things, a loner for things, a loner, plenty to keep you well oriented. And then if one of those things collapses, you know, everything doesn't go now. The, the price you pay for that is, the more you strive to optimize that balance, the less likely you are to be fantastically successful at any single one of them.

Speaker 1:          03:08          But you might have a very, you know, if you can consider your life as a whole, that might be a winning strategy. One of the things, Carl Young sad, I really liked this. He thought that men went after perfection and when women went after wholeness, so there are different, they're different value. Their did their different. There's something different at the top of the value hierarchy. So perfection would be steak it all on one thing and look for radical success. Not all, not that all men do that cause they don't. But we're, we're talking about extremes and at least with regards to the men that do that, the wholeness ideas more like, well, I want, I want, it's like I want one thing in my life to be 150% or I want five things in my life to be 80%

Speaker 1:          03:56          well there, there's a lot more richness in a life where you have five things operating at 80% but you're not operating in any of at any of them at 150% so, and I really believe this because I've watched men and women go through their careers now for a long period of time. And one of the things that, there's lots of things that produce this, but one of the things that I've noticed is that mostly women in their thirties bear bail out of unit dimensional careers. They won't do them. They won't, they won't put in the 80 hours a week that they would have to put in in order to dominate that particular area. And it isn't. The reason that they won't do it is because they decide it's not worth it. And no wonder because why would that be worth it? You have to ask yourself though. It's like, well you want to be an outstanding scientist. It's like okay, really, really that's what you want because that means that's what you do.

Speaker 2:          04:50          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          04:51          Cause you're competing with other people. You know they're smart, they're hardworking. And if you want to be at the top, you have to be smarter and work harder than any of them. And working hard means working long hours. I mean it also means working diligently. But in the final analysis it's all also an additive issue. If I'm smart and hardworking and I can crank out for 70 hours a week and you do it for 30 it's like until years, I'm so far ahead of you, you will never ever catch up. So anyways, and I think partly may be part of the reason too that women are oriented that way more than men. I think there's two reasons. One is socioeconomic status does not make women more attractive on the mating market, but it does make men more attractive. And the second is women's timeframe is compressed, right?

Speaker 1:          05:35          Cause guys can always say, well I'll have kids later and they can say that until they're like 80 whereas women, it's like, no way man, you gotta get you gotta get it together by the time were let's say 40 but really probably by 35 but definitely by 40 cause otherwise it ain't happening and that's bloody dreadful. Like the most unhappy people you ever see. Hmm. No, no. One of the common roots to extreme unhappiness is to want children and not have the, I wouldn't recommend that. You know, you see couples who were in their thirties one couple in three over the age of 30 has fertility problems. That's defined as an inability to conceive after one year of trying one in three, it's worth thinking about because people are very, very unhappy if they want to have kids and then they can't, man, you're in the medical mill for 10 years, if that's, if that's what happens to you. So, okay. So anyways, back to this.

Speaker 2:          06:30          Okay.

Speaker 1:          06:31          I think what I'll do, what time it is, it is it, because I'd have to open up a whole new can of worms so to speak, to do the next part. So I think actually what I'm going to do is just recap what we did and then stop. Or maybe we can have some questions or maybe we can call it an early day. Okay, so what, what is the fundamental issue here? What did we discuss today? All right, so you're in a frame and we've laid out its characteristics. It has a goal in it, it has a current position and it has rules for operating within it. It governs your perceptions, which is really critical thing to understand and well governing your perceptions. It's, it tells you what's useful to you and what gets in your way. But most importantly, it tells you what, you don't have to pay attention to it.

Speaker 1:          07:14          So as long as your damn frame is functional, you can ignore most of the world. And that means your stress level is way lower than it would normally be. Okay. So perception, motivation, all of that's integrated into those frames. And then the emotional element comes out in that with it. When you're within a frame, things that move you forward and validate the framer positive and things that get in your way and invalidate the frame are negative and then the next issue is, well, if your frame is invalidated, exactly what does that mean? And you can't answer that without thinking about the hierarchy of frames because if you're lucky, it just means your frame needs a minor alteration that would be equivalent to Piaget did in assimilation in some sense. Right? You can stay in the frame. You just make a small adjustment. I think the Piaget idiom distinction between assimilation and accommodation is technically inaccurate because it's a continuum, right?

Speaker 1:          08:08          I mean if I, if I want to grab your pen, I have a little frame that will enable me to do that. You say, well I'm staying within the frame to move that out of the way, but actually I'm not. What I'm doing is doing a very, I'm doing a small micro revolution in the frame, moving that to pick that up. And so it's, I think accommodation, there's no hard distinction between assimilation and accommodation. It's a continuum. So you'd say, well, if, if the top end of your map gets blown out, that requires accommodation. And if it's just a little micro change at the bottom, that's assimilation. But there's no, there's no real difference between this except for scale. And there's kind of a continual scale, not an absolute dichotomy. So, okay. So anyways, back to the back. The emotion. Okay, something happens and it isn't what you wanted. What does that mean? Well, it could mean anything. What you do is you start trying to micro adjust the frame at the highest level of resolution, but then you might find that you can't do that. So you have to jump up to the next one. You have to jump up to the next one, you have to jump up to the next one. And each time you do that, the psychophysiological cost increases. So,

Speaker 1:          09:28          okay. So, so we talked about the cost end of the spectrum and then we also talked about the engagement end of the spectrum. And so the idea would be, well, if you're, if you're very much engaged, say in

Speaker 2:          09:42          cool, do that again.

Speaker 1:          09:46          If you find it very engaging to play with your baby,

Speaker 1:          09:50          then you might be doing it in a way that's an indicating that you're taking good care of your family, that you're being a good parent and that you're being a good person all simultaneously. And there's rich meaning in that and you're the systems that orient you with regards to meaning are saying, look, you're doing this microaction in a way that benefits the maintenance and maybe even the expansion of all the frames that exist above it. And that's, that's, that's exactly what you want. You want to be doing that all the time if you can. And so that implies that you want to delineate out a pretty well developed value system so that you're not acting at odds with yourself. And you also want to have that integrated within the broader society so that society isn't existing towards you as a continual obstacle and making your life miserable.
