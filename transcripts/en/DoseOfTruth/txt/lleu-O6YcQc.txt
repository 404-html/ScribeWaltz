Speaker 1:          00:07          What has been the consequence of consequence was wild sexual experimentation. And why not? What would you expect? It's like all of a sudden reproductions under control. But does that mean that women can be as promiscuous as men? Well, maybe that's what it means. We don't know. So that was part of the big sixties experiment and it isn't obviously obvious the debt went particularly well. Um, it's certainly led to the pornography location of our society, which I think is, I really think is actually quite dreadful. Um, maybe that's my innate prudishness, but I don't know, it seems to me that pornography demeans the participants as well as the viewers. There's something second rate and furtive about it. And I think that everybody who engages in it knows that, um, it's, it's, uh, it's, it's an, it's a substitute for the real adventure of life. And I do think that it leads to a certain kind of, uh, perhaps contempt.

Speaker 1:          01:09          It leads to contempt. Um, and, and that can't be a good thing. I mean, I don't ever think, and you guys can ask yourself this question. I mean, have you ever met anybody who can finished masturbating and then was proud about it and who stood up straighter because of it? The new felt that they've really conquered life as a consequence? I mean, I just don't believe that that's the, that that's the, the general post masturbation feeling. I don't believe, I believe that it's, it's, it's, it's like, uh, it's, it's something you do when you, when you don't have the right thing to do and, and it's an admission that you're a second rate player essentially. Something like that. So the pornography vacation was a bad thing.
