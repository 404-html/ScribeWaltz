Speaker 1:          00:07          You once mentioned you were planning on making an Iq test available alongside the big five aspects scale. One, is that in the works? Yes, we have an Iq test that we use for business testing. Um, although we haven't made it available publicly yet. It is in the works but not for a while what we're doing instead. And that's because it has to be while there's a bunch of work we still have to do on it to generate the report so that they're going to be truly usable to people. Now that I would say is about three or four months. Work is necessary to do that. Um, what we are doing right now with the big five aspect scale though. So that's how understand myself.com is producing a dyad version. And so we're working on the boyfriend girlfriend version right now. So what that'll mean is that when you go there and you do your personality test and your girlfriend say, does her personality test that you'll both be able to generate a dual report that describes the similarities and differences between you and your partner and where you're likely to see eye to eye on things where you're likely to defer and what that's going to mean and what you might want to do about it.

Speaker 1:          01:13          If you know what you might be able to do about it. And this we're hoping this will be really useful because temperamental differences are a lot of the reason that people have a hard time getting along that and complete inability whatsoever to state what they actually want and to negotiate. Which is a completely different issue. I want to build a program to help people negotiate to at some point in the future. That's part of our future plan, but the next development plan is to. Well, there's two of them is to get the high school version of the cell phone program up and running and that my program or keeps promising it in two weeks and I. These things always take longer than expected, but I'm sure we'll get it out in the first quarter of 2018 and then also the dyad version of the big five aspects scale that should be out in the first quarter of 2018 as well.

Speaker 1:          02:01          And then I'm not sure if the Iq test will be next on the development track. See, one of the things we'd like to do with understand myself is to expand it out into a career I'm planning process because look at it this way. You know if you have an Iq of 100, which is the average Iq, so that would place you sort of in the middle of the average high school class. Being a lawyer is probably not a great career choice for you unless you're unbelievably conscientious because you're going to be competing with people who have a verbal facility say and a problem solving capacity that far exceeds yours. And you're going to have to work like mad to just be reasonably competent. And so what seems to be more logical is to take a good look at your intellectual prowess as given because it's very powerfully biologically influenced and to pick a domain of, of career that you could excel in because why not pick a domain that you can excel and there's lots of different things that you can be.

Speaker 1:          03:08          And so you want to consult your temperament. So if you're agreeable, then you probably want to work with people. And if you're disagreeable, you probably want to work with things. And if you're extroverted, you want to have a job that involves sales and social activity. And if you're introverted, you want to work alone. And if you're open, you need to do something creative and entrepreneurial and so on. So you have to consult your temperament to see where you would be properly slotted. And then you have to consider your intelligence so that you can find a niche where you're most likely to excel. And those niches exists. So we'd like to combine the Iq test with the big five aspects scale. So that we can give people reasonable career advice. It's been a longterm goal and so those are all on the table and I have good program team working on them, but they're very complicated things and they take a lot of time and we don't want to make a mistake and all of that. So. But maybe the couples version and the high school version of the couple's version of the personality test and the high school version of the self authoring in this quarter and maybe maybe the career counseling version of the big five aspects scale in the next year. That would be lovely. That's probably overly optimistic for the second part, but.
