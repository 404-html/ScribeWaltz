Speaker 1:          00:08          Eric says, apologies to the weird question. Have you ever performed a ritual sacrifice? No, I haven't. And it is a weird question, although I can understand why you would ask it.

Speaker 1:          00:27          I have performed psychological sacrifices, you know, I suppose when I decided to give up something that I needed to give up so that I could move forward into the future. Right. That certainly happened when I quit smoking and when I more or less quit drinking, I still have a drink from time to time now, but I quit for 20 years and that was a sacrifice. I couldn't continue to drink again. I said I was from northern Alberta. It was pretty hard drinking culture and I really liked alcohol, but I couldn't drink and write and do my phd and manage my family responsibilities. It was too much. And so I stopped and that was a good thing. So that was a sacrifice.
