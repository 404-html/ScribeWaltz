Speaker 1:          00:06          Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:07          I don't think my wife loves are internationally adopted daughter and she won't go to counseling with me. My house is filled with tyranny and anger. Any advice? Anonymous. Wow, that's a loaded. That's a set of loaded questions, man. I don't think my wife loves are internationally adopted daughter. Well, the first question would be why not? Was she in on the adoption, for example, was it partly her decision? Here's a possibility.

Speaker 2:          00:58          Maybe you could ask her under what conditions. Ask her more specifically why she doesn't like your internationally adopted daughter. It's too vague. I don't think my wife loves are internationally adopted daughter. Break it down. Maybe it's something like there are 15 things about our life with our internationally adopted daughter that my wife does not appreciate. Now maybe some of those things are the way that the daughter behaves. I don't know how old she is or anything else about her and differentiate your problem. It's too vague. You'll never solve it this way because love isn't the right word. See if you can write down 30 reasons why your wife is annoyed about your current situation and maybe you'll have to differentiate each of those 30 into 10 more, right? Maybe there's 300 reasons and then see if you can start asking her about fixing some of the reasons that you differentiate it because obviously you can't go up to her and say you have to start loving are internationally adopted daughter that's just not gonna work and you already know that. But if you break that down into the 20 reasons why she doesn't like your daughter, then maybe you can figure out a way that some progress might be made on one of those problems. And maybe if you take that approach for a whole year, then she'll go from like, she'll at least hit neutral or something like that. Um,

Speaker 2:          02:27          that's the best I can do given that I only have three sentences to go on. So differentiate the problem and then solve the smaller problems.
