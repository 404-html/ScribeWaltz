Speaker 1:          00:02          So niches idea was that human beings, we're going to have to create their own values essentially. Now he understood that we had bodies and that we had motivations and emotions like he was a romantic thinker in some sense, but way ahead of his time because he knew that our capacity to think wasn't some free floating soul, but was embedded in our physiology, constrained by our emotion, shaped by our motivation, shaped by our body. He understood that, but he still believed that the only possible way out of the problem would be for human beings themselves to become something akin to God and to create their own values. That was, that's and he thought that the person he talked about the person who could create their own values as the overmanned or the superman, and that was one of the parts of Nietzschean philosophy that the Nazis, I would say, took out of context and used to fuel their superior man ideology. So we know what happened with that. That didn't seem to turn out very well. That's for sure.
