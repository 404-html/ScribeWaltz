Speaker 1:          00:00          You have said that the only moral absolute is always to tell the truth. What if you have Anne frank and the attic and the gifts Stapel at your on your doorstep. Then I would say that there has been a lot of lies that have got you to that point. So you may be in a situation where you're damned if you turn right and you're damned if you turn left. And what that means is you made a lot of mistakes along the way. You know, so if the totalitarians or knocking at your door, if the totalitarians or knocking on everyone's door, that means everyone should have spoke up a lot sooner. And then they wouldn't end up in a situation where the Gestapo was out the door and Anne Frank was in the owl is it was in the attic. So you'd now, and then you end up in a situation where you've made so many mistakes that all you've got is hell around you.

Speaker 1:          00:43          And that was certainly the case in Amsterdam say, or an in, in when the Nazis came in on, I mean the Dutch and admirable people, and I know they were invaded by the Nazis and that was a terrible thing, but many, many, many, many, many people made many terrible moral errors for all of that to occur. And you have to be awake and do everything you can to make sure your society doesn't, this is the answer. You be away. Can you make sure everything you society does doesn't lead to the point where the Gestapo is at your doorstep and you have Anne Frank in the attic. It's a little late to be thinking then I would say.
