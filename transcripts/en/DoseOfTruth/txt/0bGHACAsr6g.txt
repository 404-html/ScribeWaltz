Speaker 1:          00:07          Hi, Dr. Peterson. Um, so what the story of Jacob today, there was a theme of betrayal and you can see that from the beginning because he was very angry and jealous of his brother. And I was thinking, are there any stories or we can say about betrayal that does come from a loved one, right? Where it's not from a place of so black and white of anger, resentment and bitter, and how the parties, um, kind of recover from that. Or is there any way to reading dot. Or is it as black and white us if you'll be traced on one, then there it's like Jacob where he's, he was bitter. He was planning

Speaker 2:          00:37          hatred, no one. And in fact, in this story, it's not black and white because we know we're only halfway through it. And, um, one of the things I've noticed as a clinician, let's say, is that an, as an observer of people in general, is that I've never ever seen anyone get away with anything. And Jacob doesn't get away with any of this. And so, um, you know, he's humbled by his eventual experiences and he learns that he did it wrong. And there's reconciliation that happens throughout the story of Jacob. So, and there's minor betrayals and major be trails. You know, that some of them have tremendously serious consequences and some of them have lesser consequences, but there is an underlying idea that things can still be set right. Even though it's, well, I think it takes Jacob some 20 years, something like that to set things right. And even then, it's like touch and go. So if I answer your question, okay, yeah.
