Speaker 1:          00:09          What should teaching and research in the humanities look like? I'm going to Grad School for literature and I don't want my work to serve the ideological possession.

Speaker 1:          00:28          Well, the thing is, first of all is that it kind of have to educate yourself. When you go to graduate school, you know you have your courses, but I don't think that you learn more than about 10% of what graduate school can teach you by taking the courses you have to read. And the mistake that most people read is make is that they only read what's been published in the last five or six years in their own narrow field and that's increasingly a bad idea. Um, the libraries are full of classic books and I would say take your field, go back to the beginning of the field. At least read the people who wrote the classic works. Bring yourself up to date and then familiarize yourself with as much history, as much history of art, as much history of literature and literature as you can possibly manage.

Speaker 1:          01:25          You want to learn as much as you can about everything. I would also say you have to ally that with a certain degree of specialization. You have to pick one topic and really become expert at it, but it'll serve as a doorway to, because everything's connected, it'll serve as a doorway to what's behind it. So you focus on one thing and read as much as you can on that. That's your specific discipline. Then outside of that, read as widely as you possibly can manage. The other thing I would really recommend, and this is also true if you're going to university, is it isn't enough to read. You also have to write and if you're going to go to graduate school, you should write every day. It's a good idea for anyone who wants to develop themselves intellectually, but even half an hour a day, you know, that's 180 hours a year.

Speaker 1:          02:08          That's a lot of thinking because writing is thinking and you should be writing out your understanding of what you wrote or what you read and the questions you have about it and trying to formulate what you regard as clear questions and problems and also clear answers. Uh, both of those. And that's how I would say you should approach graduate school. Have you thought about slowing down there? Were people worried about how hard you're pushing yourself with the countless commitments? Yes. Well, I would say that those people worried about that include, ah, I don't know if it's me, but certainly my family, they're worried about it, but I'm putting competent people around me increasingly to handle the scheduling of the public events, for example. And I have good agents in a good publisher and, um, I'm learning how to manage this. I think I've, I'm not really interested, I suppose in slowing down, although it has been a bit much in the last year and a half. I'm, I do better in some ways when I'm working flat out. Uh, if my health was good, it's better than it was by a large margin. And maybe it's still getting better. If my health was good, this, none of this would be an overwhelming challenge. But I'm trying to do everything I can to put my health in order and many, many things have been fixed. So, yeah, I thought about slowing down, but I've decided against it I guess is really the final answer to that. That's the other thing. You know there are times in your life where it's not time to slow down. It's time to,

Speaker 2:          03:50          yeah,

Speaker 1:          03:51          become more efficient. That's the thing. You can become so efficient, you know, you end up doing things in five minutes that would otherwise take you a week might. That might seem like an exaggeration, but, and I suppose it is to some degree, but it's not that much of an exaggeration. So as you take on more responsibilities and you determine that you're going to become more efficient, the responsibility pushes the efficiency. So what do they say too? There's time enough to sleep when you're in the grave. Many who respect your work feel your tweets are often impulsive or even expedient. Very funny. In certain interactions, would you consider a change in the way you tweet? Well, I've been considering that for a very long time. One of the things I did in the last month, which that I think was productive. Twitter's a hard disc, hard medium to manage because it rewards impulsivity and uh, I have somewhat of a temper and I suspect that it's maybe I'm more susceptible to being, um, to being tempted to respond in a too forceful manner. Maybe I'm more tempted by that than I should be. Um, but Twitter is real useful. I mean it does keep me updated with regards to the ongoing, let's say, war that's raging at the bottom of our culture and it does enable me to stay in contact with people, at least to some degree. And it's a great way of communicating, um, small but at least in principle important ideas and also to let people know about what I'm doing on youtube and with the tours and, and all of that. People seem to

Speaker 1:          05:55          respond positively to those of notifications. So what I did do in the last month was to find people. I tweeted out one day, I asked people to send me the Twitter handles of organizations or individuals who were reporting on positive developments in a credible and realistic way. Human progress.org seems to be doing that really well. I thought it would be good to tilt my Twitter feed toward or my Twitter, uh, my actions towards things that are positive and also true as much as possible. And so I've started doing that in the last month. Um, I feel somewhat of an obligation to, if I'm being discussed publicly by journalists or, or other professors and they misrepresent me or misrepresent the ideas that they're purporting to discuss, then I feel like I have a moral obligation to, I suppose one is to defend myself, I suppose, and certainly to object to the miss utilization of ideas by my fellow academics. I don't know if that's a,

Speaker 2:          07:15          yeah,

Speaker 1:          07:16          I don't know if that's reasonable or not. It's not easy to figure out in a situation like this, how much you shut up, how much you stay patient, how much you push back, how much you fight, how, how firmly you respond, whether or not to use wet mean. The rule I tried to outline in, uh, in my book 12 rules for life. There's a chapter called,

Speaker 2:          07:45          yeah,

Speaker 1:          07:46          don't let your children do anything that makes you dislike them. And there's a philosophy of discipline in there and, and it really has two dimensions, let's say, or two. It's, it's at the juncture of two ideas. One idea is that you don't want to make any more rules that necessary because you get tangled up in them. So minimum necessary rule. So that's a good guideline for setting up any structure even in dealing with yourself. And then if you're going to have rules, you have to enforce them because otherwise they're not rules. And so how do you enforce them with minimal necessary force? And some of that has to be played with, you know, and experimented with. So you know, what minimal force is. Those are really good principles and I try to govern myself by them in my Twitter behavior, but, and I hope that that successful, um, you know, sometimes when I've gone after people, I went after a couple of journalists in Canada last year who wrote I would, what I regard as scurrilous and incompetent articles. That's a bad combination. You know, it was kind of a harsh exchange I would say, but it isn't clear that it was the wrong thing to do. So

Speaker 1:          09:14          it's hard to know how much you have to skirt the ragged edge of disaster if you want to do things right. So anyways, I am changing the way I tweet because I'm trying to make it the bulk of it informative and positive. I guess I should say something about that too. You know, there's a lot of really good things going on in the world. So we have poverty, absolute poverty between the year 2000 and 2012 which was three years ahead of what the UN had hoped would happen. You know, and cynics say, well you have the absolute poverty, but the cutoff was kind of arbitrary. It was a dollar 90 a day, if I remember correctly, which obviously is quite low. Um,

Speaker 1:          10:00          so it's not a real transformation. It's like it's a real transformation. Some number had to be picked to represent that absolute poverty. And I don't suspect the UN erred on the side of capitalist over optimism. Perhaps they did, but hundreds of thousands of people are being connected to the power grid every day. Fresh water's available, not to fewer and fewer people, but to more and more people. And that's happening extremely rapid, rapidly. No starvation in India and China is a thing completely of the past. You never hear about that. And that's pretty much the case for the rest of the world except now. And then for political reasons. So you know, everybody's got a cell phone or an oil on anybody who doesn't, is going to have one in the next 10 years. And that puts in people's hands, uh, a degree of communication and access that would have been absolutely incomprehensible even 15 years ago. So it seems to me that the reason too that I changed, it seemed to me that it was worthwhile to change the way that I was using Twitter because all these good things are happening and just concentrating on this polarization process that seems to have gripped us in the West seems counterproductive given all those good things that are going on in the background. Now that doesn't make what's going on in the west with regards to political polarization, trivial, but it does set it inside a much more positive context. So that's something to keep in mind.
