Speaker 1:          00:07          If you plan on doing meetups with more intellectuals like Timmy Olin and Sam Harris, who would be your pick?

Speaker 2:          00:14          MMM,

Speaker 1:          00:14          well I'm going to meet Jonathan Heit. That'll be good. I really admire his work. I think he's a really good guy. So I'm looking forward to talking to him. I'd like to talk to Thomas Soul I or I think it's so, I think that would be interesting.

Speaker 2:          00:28          MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:30          The rest of it. I have to think more about that. I mean, but those are two that I would definitely like to talk to you. I'm going to speak with Jocko Willink. I think I mentioned that. So that might be interesting.

Speaker 2:          00:41          MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:42          Will there be a third talk with Sam Harris? Maybe this time with Sam as you gay your guest and you taking your gloves off. I don't have any plans for a third talk with Sam. I wouldn't be opposed to it, although I think we, I think we've probably got about as far as we were going to get in or a second discussion. I think the two discussions together actually worked quite well. Um, so I think, I think, and this is no, um, I'm not saying this in any negative way, but I think a third discussion might be, might be beating a dead horse.

Speaker 2:          01:16          Um, and

Speaker 1:          01:18          like, I'm not interested in particularly in putting Sam on the spot and, and, you know, and it's also possible that he would put me on the spot. It isn't necessarily the guy would come out victorious, so to speak. I mean, he's a very sharp guy and there's many, you know, compelling arguments to be made in favor of atheism, even though I think that overall it's, it's, it's, it's a stance that lacks, I don't think it contends with its opponent fairly, because I don't think that the atheist community in general takes the thought of serious religious thinkers. Seriously. I think they tend to Straw man.
