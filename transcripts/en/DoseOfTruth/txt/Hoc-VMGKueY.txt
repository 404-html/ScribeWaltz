Speaker 1:          00:06          So today I'm going to tell you the best three stories that I know. I think these stories are absolutely phenomenally potent and the reason for that is that I think they illustrate in an extraordinarily powerful way the nature of the processes that led to the establishment of Western democratic ideals. Rosia Aly outta whose work I rely on substantial substantially to make the following argument has taken Western academic culture to task in a manner that hasn't fully been revealed yet. He said that like all human cultures, the West is parochial and narrow in its viewpoint and although over the last 300 years there's been a substantial amount of cross cultural intermingling and a potential broadening of philosophical and religious horizon. That broadening has not been sufficiently complete.

Speaker 1:          01:13          If we build on the viewpoint that I've been developing with you over the last few courses and make the presupposition that religious modes of thinking are more phenomenological than they are rational, which means that they deal more with what you experience say. Then with the objective world. If we look at our Keck religious stories through that Lens, then they can start to open up and so given that I want to open up three religious stories to you today too in depth and one only in passing because we'll return to it later. I'll start with a Judaeo Christian myth of genesis. When I say myth, I don't mean untrue, I mean a form of knowledge that's narrative instructor and predicated on presumptions that aren't empirical. A myth describes processes of transformation. A myth describes the process whereby elements of experience come into being and transform. The fundamental structural elements of genesis are the word of God and chaos and Hebrew words for chaos and waste.

Speaker 1:          02:27          Our town for chaos and tow who for waste and Tom in particular, although tto who as well are very interesting words because you can track their derivation historically and sometimes if you can track the derivation of words historically you can get some sense of the culture mill you out of which the word spraying. And we know what time at means because we have written records of a story that involves a character named ty Matt. And timeout is a dragon who lives at the bottom of the ocean. In the oldest myth we have, which is the Enuma Elish, the Samarian creation myth, Sumeria, Babylon Acadia, rightly regarded as the birthplace of modern western civilization

Speaker 1:          03:18          in genesis two, processes unite to produce being the first of those processes are states, is chaos represented by Taya Marto, who the second of those processes is logos. And Logos is another word that has an extraordinarily broad range of meaning. It's generally transcribed in the Christian tradition has the word, and it's identified with Christ, which is a very peculiar identification because it's the word of God that creates order out of chaos. And of course, the word of God in Genesis is a phenomena that predates the birth of Christ infinitely from a classical religious perspective. So the fact that the two beings are identified as of great peculiarity and also of great interest.
