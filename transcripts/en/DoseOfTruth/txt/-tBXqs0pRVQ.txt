Speaker 1:          00:04          It is gradually become clear to me what every Greek philosophy up until now has consisted of namely the concession of its originator and the species of involuntary and unconscious autobiography. Well, that's deceptive. That's the deceptively simple sentence. Even though it's not a particularly simple sentence because it stands on its head. What people generally assume about the process of thinking.

Speaker 1:          00:37          You generally think that when you're thinking, you're thinking about, as I mentioned before, the structure of the objective world need is making an entirely different point here and what he's fundamentally doing is treating the philosopher not as a rational being, but as a living being, and there's a big difference between being a rational being and being a living being. Because if you're living being your primary goal is to do whatever it is that furthers your life and if you're a rational being, then your primary goal is to do whatever it is that a rational being. Mike Do, and you could say that a living being should first and foremost be a rational being and in some sense that's the message of the of the Western enlightenment. But it's by no means self evident that that's the case and it's certainly not something that Nietzsche Nietzsche, who doesn't believe that people are rational beings, certainly not primarily, and more importantly, he isn't exactly convinced that they should be so. So for example, one of niches, most famous maximums is that truth serves life and that's a very difficult different idea. Then the purpose of truth ses, the accurate representation of the objective world. Those aren't the same thing at all. Now you could ask, well, what does it mean for truth to serve life? And if you construe truth that way, what would truly look like? And you know the mere statement that truths should serve life doesn't offer you the answers to those questions, but

Speaker 1:          02:06          what did? It's the beginning of a different metaphysics and in some sense of metaphysics, which is say the universe within which a philosopher might operate a metaphysics is the initial structure of presuppositions within which a view of the world is organized. One presupposition might be human beings are rational and that we're attempting to formulate and improve our sense of the objective world, our formulation for the objective world, and another would be that you would be aren't rational or irrational and that we're. What we're motivated to do is to live whatever that means and that the purpose of our thinking and our philosophy should be to facilitate our living. And that's niches. That's one of the foundation blocks of philosophy. So He's a moral philosopher fundamentally because morality is about values and the values. Essentially values are

Speaker 1:          03:10          you could say values are what you aim for, but it's more complicated than that. Values actually constitute the lens through which you view the world. So it's partly what you're aiming at, but it's also partly your conception of who you are now and where you are. And it's also partly your conception of how you're going to get to where it is that you want to be. And it's also partly the psychological system that you use to parse up the world so that it reveals to you the pathway that you could take to get to what you want, values, all of that, and then it's more than that because you could say that you have added value

Speaker 1:          03:46          which contains all of that, but then you can say that you have a set of values which is the arrangement of all of that out, and then you could say that you have a set of values that's the range, but of all that, that you have to arrange with other people and then you could say that you have all that and you have to arrange it with other people and you have to arrange it across different spans of time because what you want today and what you want next week and what you want next month are not necessarily the same thing and one does not necessarily lead into the other. So to be a moral philosopher is to examine how that, what that system is and how it operates and how it came about. Now, one of the things that need to says is it has gradually become clear to me what every Greek philosophy up until now is consisted of namely the confession of its originator and the species of involuntary and unconscious autobiography. So his claim fundamentally is that no matter what the philosopher thinks he's doing well, he's reading philosophy. What he's actually doing is revealing and articulating his being,

Speaker 1:          04:48          and then you might say, well, where did that come from? And the answer to that is, well, partly it's you could consider it a biological function. In so far as that we have value structures that are built into us that are the process. We would say the process of a very long evolutionary history, but because you're also a cultural phenomena and because the manner in which you've arranged your values and your desires has been conditioned to the last degree by the process of enculturation that you were subjected to when you

Speaker 1:          05:23          confessed and an autobiographical manner and articulate that what you're also doing is really capitulating the entire structure of your culture. It's in you and you might say, well, where is it in you? In that and what does it you mean, part of it means is that you act out a pattern of behavior and that pattern of behavior is like a dance that someone is manifesting to a symphonic score. It's unbelievably complicated and it has its psychological elements and some of those are conscious and some of them aren't. Some of them are just implicit, embedded in the way you act and the way you perceive and what the philosopher is attempting to do is to reveal those to himself and to articulate them so that the entire structure can be analyzed well. So niches. First proposition is that when a philosopher is thinking that what he's doing is not thinking, it's revealing himself and an autobiographical sense under the guise of rational thinking and so then it becomes something more like a story and well, any covers all that in the first two phrases. So that gives you some example, some indication of what this book is like.
