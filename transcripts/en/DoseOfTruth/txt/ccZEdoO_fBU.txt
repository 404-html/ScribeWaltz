Speaker 1:          00:03          Two years ago or whatever it is, maybe you don't want you to face on. And Great Clinical thinkers of the 20th century, you know, some centers will be surprised is that tried to take what I'm ready to is still proudly useful. You know, I'm not taking credit and bad credit for that red [inaudible] work of many, many extraordinary awful. It's held meetings about, they say I was having a rough time, one thing or another and I started, you know, formulating a vision for my life and I'm starting to try to tell it to them more and take more responsibility and things are way there. And thank you. And so we got that. Do you ask people what I want for my birthday? Well, this is curt now. Our next like a dozen people. And what paypal was the finger? Very happy with the counter. What I've been doing it the device and how [inaudible] feminism [inaudible] or on slips [inaudible] form because I do the crowd sitting here. We [inaudible].

Speaker 1:          02:06          So, um, and so here's the theory and but what, that's not the boring, but here's the point will be visual that they're happy, encouraged. I know I'm, you're going to call home because I see it. I'm Pena and ms argument, the constant clinical workers who are afraid of have a problem, they're afraid to do be a in fair enough [inaudible] but they're not nearly enough of launching. [inaudible] can feel better about change. Jogging. You feel way worse about [inaudible] forgive me the path you would just discount this and maybe your retirement, your boss, it's made me bitter and cynical and resentful and cost are impressive and got all of those where you go from there, addicted, violent, and then work. So it's like what do you frame it? How nature interview early frame. That one, she free fat. And that's [inaudible] bones, right? You don't want to be lulled into thinking that you've got an option in terms of goal terror. And so of we want to do is take your terror please to the right place. We say the fear of God was the beginning of wisdom. Right now, I'm not making a religious cease to matter.

Speaker 1:          03:55          I don't think I'm brave face. And so the loose start started talking over in general for years goals because about her, even when I put my foot on the political now in Canada years ago, each issue, you know, personally nervous, I go to three anyway, put asleep and I thought, wow, what's turned out in farming in the city in that regard, we think we'll want to take the risk with the alternative is to take out the risk, which was to not say something. It's like, no, I wasn't taking notes down as a worsened his plan, a huge, massive, no separatism, Tiernan free [inaudible] becoming worse because good people shop [inaudible] well okay, we'll just refer to us just to get worse. It's a real nabb [inaudible] early in the knock on effect because you've never been, well I didn't want to recall turnoff.

Speaker 1:          05:26          So that's just one group. We say, well that's small, like the outlaw, which most social settings, so 20 of us. I'm probably wrong because I'm assuming, can you tell me if you're in your apartment, but at least to get you to say, maybe we can offer a kit [inaudible] work as well, where in the case if you think something, the probability than most other people also thinking very hot, a spectacular jeans and just absolutely original [inaudible]. You know, it's hard to [inaudible] but anonymously, so, but other than that, if you're a reasonable person face on, everyone else is thinking too. And just we'll say, if you say, well then maybe we'll say, and you've been talking about convenience, you know, [inaudible] types of comedian because comedians to that whole entire Taiwanese was thinking off, say, here's some of the whole thing.
