Speaker 1:          00:00          I've said that some people will tell you that the purpose of life is to be happy and those people are idiots and was a bit of a rough statement, but I what I meant by that. It was actually inspired by a statement by Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn who was the great critic of the Soviet prison system and he commented that happiness is something that's done in by the first harsh blow that reality deals you and I believe this to be the case. There are many circumstances in life where happiness is not only the wrong response, but also where the expectation of happiness as a response. We'll put you, the person attempting to be happy in absolutely the wrong psychological state. To be prepared for what must be done. People are built so to speak, to experience a very wide range of motivational and emotional states that only bear a tenuous relationship to one another.

Speaker 1:          00:55          And the reason for that is that the environment that human beings inhabit is so complex that are adaptation depends on a variety of very finally differentiated responses. And so there is a time to be compassionate and there's a time to be aggressive and there's a time to be in pain and there's a time to be anxious and there's a time to be joyous and a time to be satisfied and the healthy and well adapted person has a very wide range of finally differentiated response which cannot be boiled down to a single dimension. Say happiness versus unhappiness. A life is not that simple. And if it was, we'd only have one emotional system.

Speaker 2:          01:35          Happiness. All it is is it's a barometer. It's Dr Phil One-on-one. Dr Phil always asked, how are things working for you? And if you say things are working well, that's pretty. That's pretty much what we're meaning by happiness. Happiness does not propel us forward. So it's very weird to meet the objective of your life. And what I mean by that is while I love being a father, I can, I will tell you point blank with my wife listening, that it has not improved my happiness, meaning and purpose in life through the roof. Happiness. I was much happier as a 30 year old having a lot of time with friends and a lot of time to travel and a lot of time to basically do whatever the hell that I wanted to, so in terms of my happiness is detracted from it. Are there moments of the most profound pleasure of the most profound spirituality that I would die for these sacred vessels that I have in my life? Absolutely, but that's not happiness, that's spirituality to me is striving for the sacred and the sacred is things that you would be willing to die for. What? I'd die for a sense of satisfaction in my life. No. What would I be willing to take the bullet over my kids? Absolutely

Speaker 1:          02:50          making happiness. The focal point of your life trivializes your experiences because in order to regard anything as truly,

Speaker 3:          03:00          you also have to regard it's loss as truly meaningful, and that means that to open yourself up to experiences of deep meaning also simultaneously means that you have to open yourself up to the possibility of deep hurt and sorrow and you do that anytime, for example, that you make a relationship profound. You put your emotions on the line and that has to be real or the relationship can't be real and to hope that that sort of risk could be obliterated by the indulgence in a simplistic form of happiness is to shrink. I think in cowardess from the demands that real human existence place on people.

Speaker 4:          03:48          This is ideas in Canada on CBC radio, one across North America on Sirius Satellite Radio, Channel One 59 and around the world on CBC dot Ca. I'm Paul Kennedy. You're listening to CBC, producer Frank Foulkes say no to happiness. The renowned psychiatrist and concentration camp survivor Viktor Frankl wrote what man actually needs is not attention list state, but rather the striving and struggling for a worthwhile goal of freely chosen task. There is much wisdom in the words of Nietzsche. He has a why to live, for can bear almost anyhow. We now return to frank's documentary, say no to happiness

Speaker 3:          04:39          at every moment. We're surrounded by what we know and can understand, but outside of that, we're surrounded by all the things that we do not know and cannot understand and that can manifest themselves at any moment. So we're like small islands of tentative certainty and a massive sea of uncertainty in ignorance. That's our existential condition. It's really our environment. Even from a scientific perspective. It's the environment that we've emerged into and have adapted to and we have to take that into account when we deal with our lives because that's the truest nature of our life. It's ordering the midst of infinite chaos. The human problem is how to make sense out of the constant investor play between that tentative order in that infinite chaos.

Speaker 4:          05:30          Jordan Peterson is a professor of psychology at the University of Toronto. He is also the author of maps of meaning, the architecture of belief. His book explores how religious and mythological stories shed light on our existential predicament and in turn can provide a sense of meaning and purpose. In the Old Testament in genesis, it's one of the most profound ideas ever expressed. The Old Testament God in

Speaker 1:          05:57          generates order out of chaos and upon doing so, he states, man and woman are made in my image. What does he mean by that? Well, he dignifies the human soul with that statement, but the attribution of dignity is based on a psychological and an ontological reality and that reality is that what the individual consciousness confronts is equivalent in some sense to the chaos that God originally turned into order at the beginning of time. In that what you confront moment to moment is the potential of being. That's what consciousness does. It takes unformed potential and makes it manifest and each human being has the choice about which direction that potential will manifest itself in, but not about whether or not that manifestation will take place. Because it takes place no matter what and that's why the moral obligation of existence is incumbent on our being.

Speaker 3:          07:03          Existence implies coexistence to be is to be involved with the life of others. We delude ourselves if we think that we're simply innocent bystanders and life being is never neutral. What we do matters. You can be a creator of things positive or you can be a creator of things negative or you can be a creator who abdicated their responsibility, but in all three situations, you are participating in the process that turns chaos into order and there is no escaping that. When the high school kids, the chart up columbine wrote about their philosophy and

Speaker 1:          07:49          the most telling aspect of their philosophy was their judgment of exist in state and they did. You can read this on the net. Their conclusion at the great age of 19 was that the tragedy of existence was such that being itself was corrupt. That because people suffered and because of the world was a dangerous and terrible place. That being itself should be eradicated and this is a very common judgment, is far more common than people think. And once you forego the luxury of deciding in a sense to hell with everything that that everything is so corrupt that it's unredeemable, once you forego that luxury, then it becomes incumbent on you to try to work for the betterment of being in that requires faith and and the reason it requires faith is because a, you don't know if being can be bettered, and B, you don't know if you're the creature to do it, but the peculiar thing is is that you will never find out if being can be bettered or if you're the creature to do it, until you assume

Speaker 3:          08:56          that it can be bettered and you assume that you are that creature to do it. Critics of religious thinking believed that what faith means is the willingness to suspend rational judgment and swallow any old thing. No matter how absurd. And that's not what faith means at all. What faith means is the willingness to put yourself on the line in pursuit of those things that you find deeply meaningful. And that's why so many great philosophers such as Soren kierkegaard emphasize above all the role that faith plays. I'm a clinical psychologist. I have an active practice, 20 clients and I see them weekly and I'm a professor of psychology at the University of Toronto and so it might be surprising that I use religious language, but it's not surprising because as soon as you start to talk about the deepest meanings of life, the language that is most appropriate is immediately religious and the reason for that is that religion is precisely that element of human existence that deals with the most profound elements of human being.

Speaker 3:          10:12          I believe that the reason for this is this, in some sense, human existence is so contradictory that it's in in a manner technically impossible. We're limited creatures and we face unlimited catastrophe in in that everything we know will disappear and everyone we love will die. And so that makes existence. Human existence in a sense existentially impossible, but the religious impulse combats that in a sense because the religious impulse opens up to the human being the possibility that there is sufficient absolute within to serve as an antidote to the absolute without and the notion that it's necessary to have an individual relationship with the absolute. With God, for example, is a statement of the fact that we are in fact adapted to the nature of reality, and if we draw on everything that is within ourselves without fear, then we can develop the sorts of personalities that are powerful enough to confront the horrible absolute and to consider that justifiable and worthwhile.

Speaker 5:          11:31          I want to put it in a good word coming from the Jewish tradition, a good word for happiness. It's, it's, it's striking to me that the very first word in the first verse of the First Chapter of the Book of Psalms is a word that is probably best translated as happy, so it says in Psalms happy is the one who does not stand in the way of the wicked or walk with sinners or sit in the company of but whose delight is in the law of the Lord in God's law. Does he meditate day and night? Happiness is a, I think a not a bad thing. It's certainly better than its opposite, but, but clearly it is inadequate as a goal for our lives. If that's all that we can aspire to, then our lives to become trivial, then they become insignificant. The happiest creature in the world I think is a lizard sitting in the sun, and if all we want to be or lizards sitting in the sun, it won't work for us because we have an awareness that lizards don't have.

Speaker 5:          12:27          We have an awareness that there is something greater than ourselves, greater than our material, corporeal being that there is the infinite. Dan Polish is the author of talking about God, exploring the meaning of religious life with regard boober Tillich and Heschel in his book, Polish explorers. How each of these thinkers understand the human encounter with the infinite. The Danish Christian philosopher Soren Kierkegaard coined the term anxious or anxiety to describe our experience as limited beings overwhelmed by the infinite. Paul Tillich, a Christian theologian talked about the courage to be in the face of our existential predicament. The Jewish theologian, Martin Buber talked about the importance of holding ourselves open to the unconditional mystery that we encounter in every sphere of our life. Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel spoke of knowing life has ultimate meaning. Though we can never fully comprehend that meaning only sense it, all of them could be characterized is existentialist thinkers, by which I mean that they like other existentialists recognize that as Shakespeare said, there's more in heaven and earth than there is in your philosophy of ratio.

Speaker 5:          13:46          They don't focus on creating theories. They know that the mind can go only so far so they don't start with theory. They start with a with human experience it religiously. That means that they are less interested in talking about what God is a then it talking about how we human beings respond to God rather than trying to define that which they recognize ultimately as beyond the capacity for human beings do either define or even understand and that unless we find a way of living constructively with the infinite are living in the infinite. Unless we find the courage to have faith in that which we cannot begin to understand or begin to articulate a, then we're then we're going to suffer what kierkegaard called [inaudible]. We're going to suffer that anxiety. Character guard by all accounts was not a happy fellow. He suffered a major romantic disappointment as a young man and eventually retreated into a solitary life of study and writing when it came to achieving happiness in this life. He didn't

Speaker 2:          14:51          believe it was possible. The best we can do is aspire to diminish the anx that defines human

Speaker 5:          14:59          existence. As for the other three, the who lived in the 20th century that that I've written about his show, Uber Tilak, all three of them knew a great deal of suffering in their lives so that the idea of happiness being something paramount, I think we'd look ridiculous to them. All three of them were forced to leave Germany and Europe when it fell under Nazi domination. Heschel, of course, came to the United States before the full horrors of the Nazi reality acted itself out in Europe. He was living in Cincinnati, Ohio when he got word that his whole family had been exterminated.

Speaker 1:          15:43          I've said that some people will tell you that the purpose of life is to be happy and those people are idiots, and it was a bit of a rough statement, but I. What I meant by that, it was actually inspired by a statement by Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn who was the great critic of the Soviet prison system and he commented that happiness is something that's done in by the first harsh blow that reality deals you and and and I believe this to be the case.

And so there is a time to be compassionate and there's a time to be aggressive and there's a time to be in pain and there's a time to be anxious and there's a time to be joyous and a time to be satisfied and healthy and well adapted person has a very wide range of finally differentiated response which cannot be boiled down to a single dimension. Say happiness versus unhappiness. A life is not that simple. If it was, we'd only have one emotional system.

Speaker 2:          17:18          Happiness. All it is is it's a barometer. It's Dr Phil One-on-one. Dr Phil always asked, how are things working for you?

Speaker 3:          18:33          making happiness. The focal point of your life trivializes your experiences because in order to regard anything as truly important, you also have to regard it's loss as truly meaningful, and that means that to open yourself up to experiences of deep meaning also simultaneously means that you have to open yourself up to the possibility of deep hurt and sorrow and you do that anytime, for example, that you make a relationship profound.

Speaker 4:          19:31          This is ideas in Canada on CBC radio, one across North America on Sirius Satellite Radio Channel One 59 and around the world on CBC dot Ca. I'm Paul Kennedy. You're listening to CBC, producer Frank fulks say no to happiness. The renowned psychiatrist in concentration camp survivor, Viktor Frankl wrote what man actually needs is not a tension

Speaker 5:          19:57          duration of for us to live in ways that transcend simple selfishness, simple egocentricity, simple focusing on ourselves. Ryan hold neighbor who was actually a very close friend of Heschel, said that life has no meaning except in terms of responsibility. I'm sure how she would he would shake his head absolutely. One of Heschel's earliest books is called the image of God in this world. Humanity. Human beings are God's image in this world. Our goal in life is very clear to be in this world what we would want God to be in this world,

Speaker 6:          20:46          for us to our actions and our behaviors and our engagements, to manifest God in the world, to be radically discontent with the things that exist in this world, to be radically discontent with the social evils that we see around us. Do what we can to write them because we are God's own self is at work in this world, which actually would say means where we finally become the most human.

Speaker 2:          21:35          I've gotten very interested in the psychology of morality because we often push it aside to just religious teachings, religious ideas, and when we're making moral decisions on a daily basis, and it makes me think of exemplars of people that have profound meaning and purpose in life, but are probably average to below average on happiness and Martin Luther King happens to be a real great example of this. Todd Cashton is associate professor of psychology at George Mason University in Virginia. He is the author of designing positive psychology, a book on the science of wellbeing. Professor cashton regularly gives talks and workshops on how to live a worthwhile and meaningful life. This is someone in context who had extreme righteous indignation. This is a, this is just a manifestation of anger, of the mistreatment of other, of other fellow human beings on the lack of equality and fairness. These are fundamental moral principles and his life was devoted to this.

Speaker 2:          22:43          Um, if you're talking about pursuing goals that are outside the parameters of happiness, look to Martin Luther King, the idea of absorbing the blues, the hatred, the prejudice, the discrimination for other people to make a point that these, these behaviors are not indicative of what a good society is built on, and Martin Luther King is not the only person. He just happens to be a public exemplar. You have people in schools right here in DC where I'm sitting right now who are devoting themselves in inner city kids. You've got teachers that are creating a safe space for them, a place where they can actually learn and grow and become a moral outstanding citizen. We're talking about people that are taking time away from their own happiness to do something that really matters and but lead to a sense of morality, meaning and purpose in life. They just don't fit on the same spectrum. Now, there are multiple pathways to living a good life and I think a better approach than having happiness as the ultimate end point is to do things you care about. We're not talking about happiness. We're talking about engagement. We're talking about meaningful pursuits.

Speaker 1:          24:03          Nothing can drive you to find the deepest meanings of life without first realizing the absolute fragility of life because there's nothing that's sufficiently terrifying as realization of that absolute fragility and it's necessary to be profoundly terrified before you can be motivated to seek out those things that are of the highest value as a consequence of considering these ideas for many years and especially considering the role that evil has played, say in the 20th century and also the role that suffering plays in life. I've asked myself deeply what the purpose of life might be and and it seems to me that life requires virtue and so then you might ask, well, what do I mean by virtue? And what I mean by virtue is following whatever it is in your life that manifests itself to you as meaningful and right. And there's quota sales to that. For example, in order to determine clearly what's meaningful and right, you have to stop light because if you lie to yourself or you lie to other people, you blind yourself and then the things that might appear to you as meaningful are no longer trustworthy because you're using an instrument that you voluntarily damaged to perceive reality and that will lead you astray and virtue requires well requires humility because you have to stop thinking that you know, and so humility and honesty are absolute preconditions.

Speaker 1:          25:38          Courage as well as necessary because you will have to learn to come to terms with your own capacity for anxiety and dread and aggression and the and even your capacity for welfare, terrible acts, and to continually set yourself right is to walk down the path I believe of moral virtue.

Speaker 2:          25:57          I would contrast the difference between having happiness as a desirable thing, which it's incredibly desirable to be happy, but what I like to talk about is thinking about this as a compass provided navigator of which direction to go into. It doesn't tell them what direction it says, here's the direction that you're facing. If happiness is your compass to navigate through the complexities and ambiguities of life, it means when something is negative or problematic, that's the wrong direction to move into. When it's your values become your compass, it's very different. Let me give you example, so one of my fundamental values, I have twin four year old girls, is to try to be a good father and instill good values in them and try to cultivate their strikes and so when I'm faced with conflicts, which we all are faced with, I love writing. I love doing science.

Speaker 2:          26:54          I loved teaching and I'm in the middle of a great writing session. Eight hours, I'm in flow of the words were just spilling out of my brain onto the page and I look at the clock and I realized it's almost time for their bedtime. I've got a conflict here. Do I continue with this incredible writing session or do I make sure I've seen my kids before I go to sleep, read them a story, tuck them in, showed them some affection, and maybe come back to this. Am I writing? Might not be as good afterwards knowing that my values are to trying to be a good father and instill values in them helps me with the decision and it helps them decide if know what I'm going to go home, spend some time with my children, come back to my work. If happiness is my objective, it leaves me in a much bigger quandary of all of these conflicts of what do I do with the limited amount of time and energy I have in any given day and all of these competing things that are fighting for my attention, meaning and purpose in life and values is a very stable compass.

Speaker 2:          27:55          This is a way to create a life, to feel good about who we are, to have an understanding of what type of person we want to be and try to close the gap between what we do and what we strive to become. I want to make my personal signature on my work so that I leave the world a little bit of a better place.

Speaker 7:          28:15          Yeah.

Speaker 3:          28:24          There's an old idea of deeply embedded, again in western religious thinking that reality is in some sense, incomplete, unfinished or broken, and that the role of the human being is to complete it, to perfect it, to finish it and see the idea that reality is in some sense unfinished and hence it's tragic and incomplete manner, and that the role of the human being is in some sense to participate in its perfection is a concept that is so profound that it makes happiness as a concept designed to encapsulate the meaning of life so shallow that it instantly becomes virtually negligible.

Speaker 1:          29:14          We have a hypothesis here that the purpose of conscious being is for those beings who are conscious to transcend their mortal limitations and to work for the perfection of all that exists as a goal that justifies suffering. That's unbeatable. I think because what it does is broaden and deepen your life in a manner that you might compare to the difference between elevator music. A Beethoven symphony.

Speaker 3:          29:43          It's not that the symphony is in any sense happier than the Muzak, and in fact quite the contrary, but it's deeper and more profound. Enricher and incorporates more and justifies itself more and that's the right metaphor for life, not happiness, but, but depth and and, and differentiated quality and profundity to match the profundity of the necessity of suffering.
