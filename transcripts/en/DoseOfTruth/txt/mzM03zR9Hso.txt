Speaker 1:          00:02          Once leadership, it's the capacity to see what the hell's in front of your face and maybe in every direction and then the capacity to use your language properly in a transformative manner and to transform chaos into order and God only know how those, how long it took the Mesopotamians to figure that out and the best they could do is dramatize it, but it's staggeringly brilliant. No, it's. It's by no means obvious and this chaos is chaos is a very strange thing and this is the chaos that God wrestled with at the beginning of time. Chaos is what? It's half psychological and half real. There's no other way to really describe it. The chaos is what you encountered when you're thrown into deep confusion, right? When your world falls apart, when, when you encounter something that blows you into pieces, when your dreams die, when you're betrayed, it's the chaos that emerges and the chaos has everything at once and it's too much for you and that's for sure, and it pulls you down into the underworld and all. That's where the dragons are and all you've got at that point is your capacity to bloody well, keep your eyes open and to speak as carefully and clearly as you can and maybe if you're lucky, you'll get through it that way and come out the other side and it's taken people a very long time to figure that out.
