Speaker 1:          00:14          Kids and that doesn't necessarily sound very important. They're just really, again, is actually a microcosm of world just like any play. Normally the microcosm of normals are capitalism and say you've been learning people about like playing because even though it's the board is real, people with real emotions that will be relevant in real until you can see what their funding, if they're funding play in winning, he attributes it detached themselves from a little bit so that it's easy. Hey, remember that it's like the sophisticated things. It's fundamental a rate by testing to play with your testing, how well they match was and so that's what kids do. Play Games with their friends too. It's more complicated because those games, especially if they're pretending. So let's say kids freaking excited, going to play house. This is a common kits and pavement first thing that it was negotiation, so screenwriters and say, will you be the mom that you need the data?

Speaker 1:          01:49          You know, you can be the cat and then if everyone wants to play that role, but that's the first thing the kids have. All the kids have to one play voluntarily or not, so that's a good thing to keep in mind. Everybody accepts the goal and then you might say, well then they go and imitate the mother and the father and the cap, but they don't actually imitate them because like if I was entertaining, you would move exactly the same way you will, but if I was caricatured review, let's say I got to know you a little bit, then I can kind of adopt the spirit of your voice and your mannerisms. Whatever they are, I could extract from you a pattern of church artist doing. I could avoid that pattern on some long more sophisticated interest invitation and that's what the kids are trying to do when they play house and I'm indicating their father because they weren't doing exactly the same movements that the father was doing.

Speaker 1:          02:40          They've watched the quad that need the father over multiple contexts and they've extracted on the commonalities across those contexts and portrayed that with the term terms. You can think about that as a spirit. It's the spirit of that being the partner across multiple contexts and then they're acting that representing a play and so they can say what they're doing and they can't tell them what the rules are, but they can use their own body to represent this incredibly complex thing that they don't understand and they could do the same thing with mother. They can play with a goal and feed it and do all those things, but the mother doesn't can practice being a mother, so they learn how to do this ideal. Describe it. There's a lot of things that we knew like that and so we know how to act out things that you don't understand it now.

Speaker 1:          03:33          Eventually we figured out collectively over the 10 years you've been trying to figure things out, how to act in a manner that makes us essentially civilized, civilized. That enables us to sit in this group even though we don't know each other and to all the same thing, to all the same posture and to all about essentially the same attitude, Nsap, emotional state, and to thereby being predictable to one another and to be safe with one, which is what we're doing right now. It's a ritual. Everyone understands it's a theatrical Richard that everyone understands and the fact that everyone is doing the same thing means that we can all be virtually assured that at the moment we're all holding the same ideal and that's why we're not terrified because if someone, all of a sudden I stood up and branch to 90 nineties, this was not be the same place.

Speaker 1:          04:22          Right? It was seriously, you don't want the same place and you wouldn't be using the same part of your brain to process. It would switch instantly and you'd be possessed by ancient motivational states, terror and rage and the preparation for action. That would be completely outside of the neurological systems that you're using to orient yourself at this moment and people do not like it. When that happens. We don't like even if someone, you know what that's like, if you're walking down the street and you see someone who's doing something that isn't normal, like maybe they're muttering to themselves preaching a little bit or something like that and they're a little disheveled, you'll do what almost everyone does, which is we'll give them a wide berth and you'll keep on walking and you probably do what you can not to make eye contact because that's an invitation, so you're, you're.

Speaker 1:          05:15          You walk down the street and you think, oh, there's some unexplored territory circumvented that, and then you continue on so everything you can as a consequence of your options to stop yourself from being exposed to anything that disrupts the stability of the theory that you're using to orientate yourself in the world. That's why people hold onto their theories because underneath that is like terror rage and you don't want that coming up and so we don't take it kindly. People come along and masks are the axioms of our theories. We seriously look like that and that's partly why people are so motivated to protect their belief systems. Right? It's not only that we construe the world with our belief systems, we organize our social behavior, we started building systems, and so if you mess with the belief systems, you mess with the structure that makes everyone predictable to everyone else.

Speaker 1:          06:06          And that is not. There's nothing been down that path, that's for sure. Alright, so now we've learned how to act out this pattern. It makes us acceptable and desirable project and we're constantly reminding each other how to do that because like if you go to a party, you're gonna want people who knows when you walk by. If you're the typical person, a typical reasonably well socialized person, you're going to want people to like you more than they dislike what you're going to want to pay some attention to you. You're going to want to engage people in interesting conversation. Maybe you're going to want people to appreciate you and you know if you want to have a good time to have a good time party needs to act in a certain way that elicits a certain set of responses from other people. And if you fail it, that they will tell you, they'll ignore you, they won't laugh at your jokes, you know they'll move away from you.

Speaker 1:          07:03          There's all sorts of reasons. There's all sorts of things they will do to broadcast at you, your deviation from the ideal. And that can be very painful, right? Especially if you're very deviant from the ideal because it opens up this realization that you just don't know what they hell you're doing at all, and that either means that other people are contemptible and horrible and something should be done about that or that there's something seriously wrong with you that needs to be rectified. And neither of those options are very pleasant. So we carry within us, let's say, implicit ideal that we carry within us. A counter idea as well. The opposite of that. That's an introduction in some sense to the landscape of good and evil because the ultimate ideal is whatever is good, that the ultimate counter ideal is whatever's evil. So that's the space within which we map our behaviors and we can't help but map out that space because it's.

Speaker 1:          07:58          It constitutes the most extreme version of this structure that we use to evaluate everything everyone else does in everything we do. We also know that that's the case because when you go to a movie, even though you don't know that you know it's the case, you go to a movie, let's say it's an action group or it doesn't matter. It could be a roadmap. Maybe those are the two basic categories of foods. Naturally he has a hero if you're is either greg or partially do like a complex here, but in kind of a flawed and interesting way. Right? And then of course in an action movie, there's the evil bad guy as well, but hopefully he's not good enough because otherwise it's a caricatures, but always into movies. You have that hero and the villain and the intermodal maxwell that you have the person who's the love interest in all those who've failed to measure up.

Speaker 1:          08:48          And so it's the same thing. It's just played out for different reasons. So you know it's, it's difficult to understand that if you go to see your movie, which is fiction, isn't real, then it's also more real than real because otherwise you either watching it, you don't want the movie director to show you how many times the protagonists links before they get out of bed in the morning. It's not interesting when you want them to do is to take the full panoply of here with behavior and only extract from it those instances that are particular interest in relationship to the portrayal of that ideal or the counter id. You want to see why they're bad guys bad and you want to see why the group guys good and that's more real than reality because it's abstracted from reality. It's more real than reality. Like numbers are more real than the things that are derived from some form of abstraction.

Speaker 1:          09:49          Right? And it doesn't. It makes perfect sense that when you want to extract from fictional representations, there's represent representations of what's good and what's evil, so that in principle, assuming that this is what you want, you could do a better job of embodying what's good because then everything would go well for you in the world world, assuming that that's what you want, so there's probably nothing more important than you could possibly do that. No do that, and that's why you treat it like it's more important than anything else. You can do this. If you think about it, you will go to a movie and you'll line up and you pay to be exposed to that kind of information and that's an. That's an indication of exactly how it is, right? You actually find most of you, and if it isn't movies slogan, it's it's fiction or or stories that people tell you, no interest whatsoever in people and that's very rare. If even if that's the case, you'll find that science fiction or something else like that where the mythology creeps into the technology doesn't really matter. It's going to come at you one way or another and the fact that you will pay to expose yourself to that and then also that when you go into those venues, be entranced by it despite yourself, despite the fact that you know, is real, is an indication of exactly how important that information is.
