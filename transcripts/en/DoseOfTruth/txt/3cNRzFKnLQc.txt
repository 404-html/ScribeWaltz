Speaker 1:          00:07          Assuming a minimal mutual willingness to be any contact and to receive communications, we may say that the greater the communicated congruence of experience, awareness and behavior on the part of one individual, the more the ensuing relationship will involve a tendency towards reciprocal communication with the same qualities, mutually accurate understanding of the communications. It probed psychological adjustment and functioning in both parties and mutual satisfaction in the relationship. Pretty good hypotheses. So basically what he's saying is that,

Speaker 2:          00:41          okay,

Speaker 1:          00:42          if we're communicating and I tell you what's actually going on with me the best I possibly can and try to get rid of all of the motives that have nothing to do with communication, then that's going to work out quite nicely in the long run. It's gonna work out for both of us and for the relationship. So like it's good. It's an interesting hypothesis.

Speaker 1:          01:07          I can tell you that people don't do this. You know, I showed you that Gottman, I don't know how many of you looked at that blame the Godman studies on marital satisfaction. Right? But I thought that was really interesting because I've seen people like that lots of times, you know, they're on the surface, everything's fine, but well sometimes the tension is so high, you can hardly even stand to be in the room with the people you know, because you, you can just add, add, add, add an embodied level, you're mirroring the distress, you know, we get a pit in your stomach, it's hard to breathe and you just know. It's probably smell, I think is what it's trans as what it's communicated by, you know, smell affects us and all sorts of ways we don't understand. So here, here's an example. Women like the smell of tee shirts that men wore if the men are symmetrical better than if the men aren't symmetrical. So that's a good example of how smell affects you. It affects you in lots of ways. So anyways.

Speaker 2:          02:01          MMM.

Speaker 1:          02:05          What godman observed was that basically that the capitals that weren't getting along, we're just lying to each other all the time. Right? Because they were pretending that everything was all right. When in fact nothing was all right at all. Their bodies were going haywire. That's a technical term haywire. So it was way too stressful for them. And you, you might say, well, why is that bad? Why shouldn't you be like that? Because that's a good question. Well, one is if your stress responses are to elevated, we know what happens. That's the general I stress response. Your cortisol levels go up and then well then you age the fast. So if you want to age fast, that's a very good way of doing it. But if that's not your goal, your goal is peace and harmony. Then pretending that everything's all right without communicating isn't going to work. And so the couples aren't saying things like there's something about the way we're talking, it's making me extremely nervous, you know? And then actually tried to figure that out. It's like, I wouldn't say, well, you're making me nervous because, well, maybe you are, but maybe not. Maybe I'm just a nervous type. God only knows. Let's see if we can sort this out. Or maybe I'm nervous about something else completely. You know, maybe I'm nervous about women.

Speaker 1:          03:17          So there's lots of digging to do. Okay. So you can think about that and think, well, is that a reasonable proposition now?

Speaker 2:          03:28          Okay,

Speaker 1:          03:28          you can try this. This is an excellent, this is, I'm not going to t tell you many specific psychological exercises, but this is a really good one. It's hard to,

Speaker 2:          03:40          okay,

Speaker 1:          03:40          Rio communicational curves and the evaluative tendency avoided when we listen with understanding. So the evaluated Roger's theory is, is difficult to understand with regards to the relationship between the evaluation and unconditional positive regard because he tends to speak as if the valuation is bad. But really what he means is hierarchical elevate evaluation, which is you're worse than me or I'm better than you. It's like those things might even be true in any given case, but they're not relevant to what we're doing. Right? We're trying to do something, I'll do it than that. So when that creeps in, I think of that as dominance, hierarchy, maneuvering, not Africans all the time. When people are talking, you know, they're just maneuvering around in a dominance hierarchy. They're not trying to communicate. So that's the evaluative tendency. What does this mean? It means to see the expressed idea.

Speaker 1:          04:29          And attitude from the other person's point of view to sense how it feels to him to achieve his frame of reference in regard to the thing he is talking about stated so briefly. This may sound absurdly simple, but it is not. It's an approach which we have found extremely potent in the field of psychotherapy. It's the most effective agent we know for altering the basic personality structure of an individual and improving his relationships and his communications with others. That's a quite the statement. You know the most effective agent we know for altering the basic personality structure of an individual. If I can listen to what he tells me, if I can understand how it seems to him, if I can see it's personal meaning for him, if I can sense the emotional flavor which it has for him, then I will be releasing potent forces of change in him.

Speaker 1:          05:17          If I can really understand how he hates his father or the university or columnists, if I can catch the flavor of this sphere of insanity or his fear of atom bombs or of Russia, it will be of the greatest help to him in altering those very hatreds and fears and in establishing realistic and harmonious relationships with the very people and situations towards which he has felt hatred and fear. We know from our research, by the way, Rogers was one of the first clinicians who empirically evaluated the outcome of psychotherapy and so he actually more or less established the idea that therapy outcomes should be measured scientifically. And, and in doing that, he, in some sense, he set down one element of the standards by which modern clinical psychologists are actually trained in practice because the modern clinical psychologist is a scientist practitioner. So the idea is that you should be trained as a researcher and as a practitioner and that's quite unique.

Speaker 1:          06:14          Doctors, medical doctors for example, are not trained that way. Although you could make a very strong case that they should be. We know from our research that such empathic understanding, understanding with a person, not about him. It's such an effective approach that it can bring about major changes in personality. Now, some of you may be feeling that you listen well to people and that you've never seen such results. The chances are very great indeed that you're listening has not been of the type I have described. Fortunately, I can suggest a little laboratory experiment, which you could try to test the quality of your understand. The next time you get into an argument with your wife or your friend or with a small group of friends to stop the discussion for a moment and for an experiment institute this rule. Each person can only speak up for himself once he has first restated the ideas and feelings of the previous speaker accurately and to that speaker satisfaction.

Speaker 1:          07:13          Now, that's the annoying part, right? Because if you're in an argument, you're going to use all sorts of rhetorical devices in order to win. One of the most obvious of those rhetorical devices is that you make your case. And I only half listen cause I'm formulating what I'm going to say to you next. And then I pro I impose a bias in my processing of your argument. And so that what I address when I talked to you is the sort of argument that you'd make if you were weak and stupid and contemptible and then I go after that and that's basically a straw man approach, right? I take your, I take your position and I try to make it into the scrawny as little ratty ass thing I can possibly manage illustrating that it needs to be rubbed out and then I'd rub it out. It's like the rigid approaches are actually exactly the officer.
