Speaker 1:          00:07          Alright, so postmoderns and we talked about it a little bit, we'll return to it. Now we're going to talk a little bit about Marxism. I've got a quote here from mark's. The proletarians have nothing to lose, but they're chains. Uh, well, that was pretty good for like 1880 or 1890 or whenever it was. He wrote it. Somewhere around that period of time it turned out the proletarians had a lot more to lose than their chains. They had their lives and their families to lose. That was demonstrated and play as a consequence of the, what would you call it, the sociological movements that were put into place when the Marxist presuppositions began to govern societies like the Soviet Union. So, all right, so let's take the same postmodernist approach. So here's some basic tenants of Marxism. It's Berge Lousy against proletariat and the bourgeoisie year. They're capitalists, the property owners, those sorts of people.

Speaker 1:          01:02          The proletariat, the working class, for all intents and purposes. The basic idea is that history itself is nothing but the, what would you call it? The documentation of the struggle of one class against the other. Okay. No, like, that's wrong, but it's okay because it's too simple. Obviously. It's obviously too simple. There's all sorts of motivations that people have. Some of them are economic, some of them are associated with power. Um, but that's okay. We will leave that. Let's, let's give the devil his due and say, well, yeah, fair enough. There is still a fair bit of tension between the haves and the haves and the have nots. And maybe that was even more intense and previous societies than it is now. And it's no, there's no doubt that economics plays a role in, in virtually everything that human beings do in a fairly significant role.

Speaker 1:          01:52          So let, let's, let's accept that as a potential theory. It's, it's simple, but maybe it's practically useful. And then there's kind of an offshoot of that theory, which is that, well, if you're a Marxist, that means you have sympathy for the working class. Right? Because that's what you're saying all the time. It's like, well, the poor working class, they're all oppressed. The poor, poor proletariat, you know. And then you're also saying, well, we're the good guys because we're standing on the side of the oppressed. And so then you might also ask what you're marginalizing when you claim that you're the good guys because one of the things that you would be marginalizing is all of the ways in which you're not the good guys, but we can leave that aside for a moment to. So there's the claims is that, you know, there's the working class against the ruling class.

Speaker 1:          02:36          Another claim is the ruling class is the ruined class because they exploit the working class basically stealing their excess labor from them. Um, another very, very, uh, what, uh, surfacely attractive claim that lacks any reasonable justification, you know, because it's predicated the idea of the world as a zero sum game. And clearly the world is not a zero sum game. So when someone creates wealth, when someone is wealthy, it can be at least at times because they created it, not because they swiped it from someone else. I think, you know, you can think of someone like Bill Gates or Steve Jobs is a good example of that.

Speaker 2:          03:17          Um,

Speaker 1:          03:18          you know, they're, they're what they produced pad and value that far exceeded what they garnered as a consequence of their production even though what they garnered was fairly substantial. So anyways, but we'll get, like you said, we're going to give the devil his due. Okay. It's the bourgeoisie against the proletariat will accept that. It's class warfare is the primary historical mover. No problem. Now, but here's what I'm not willing to give away so easily. Uh, we have sympathy for the working class primarily, and we're good because of that. No, I'm not gonna just give that away. So simply. So let's investigate that a little bit. Let's see if we can actually figure it out. If that's true. We'll say a use a pragmatic approach because I'm a pragmatist. I'm in the William James Sense. Ah, uh, or maybe you can think about it even more deeply in anciently. Uh, there's a statement in the New Testament, I think it's by their fruits, you shall know the fine.
