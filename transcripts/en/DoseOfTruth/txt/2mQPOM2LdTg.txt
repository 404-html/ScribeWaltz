Speaker 1:          00:06          Okay, now you know what you see on the left there at the top on the. Sorry, on the right at the top you see a picture of an old man kissing Joseph Stalin, which is quite a weird thing to do. Given that Joseph Stalin was probably responsible for the deaths of some number of people in excess of 10 million, perhaps an excessive 30 million people argue about this all the time. He certainly starved 6 million Ukrainians to death in the 19 thirties, which is something that you know, for some reason you don't hear much about your education, but you know, 6 million Ukrainians probably worth noticing a little bit, but it doesn't matter because this old man, this was taken after the fall of the Berlin Wall. He's nostalgic for the times when everything was certain you know, and the, the Gold Statue of style and his representation in some sense of a day of five leader.

Speaker 1:          00:55          And the old man is there is in a position of worship and then captain hook there at the bottom on the right hand side. He is quite an interesting character because he's basically a tyrant. And the Peter Pan Story is very interesting because Peter Pan Pan Sorta means everything and Peter Pan is the sort of person who wants to retain the dynamic potential of childhood because when you're a child you're not anything but you could be anything. So you're pretty much only potential. And then you might say, well why should you sacrifice that potential to become something actual? Because in some sense it's actually a limiting process. So for example, and I mean this in the most concrete possible way, you have more neural connections when you're born than you do at any other time in your life. And most of those die by the time you're too. So you go through this tremendous pruning process from when you're born, from when, til two.

Speaker 1:          01:51          So it's like you're dying into your childhood personality. And then again, the same thing happens at the end of adolescence between say 16 and 21, which is also the peak time for risk for the emergence of schizophrenia. And some people think that's the pruning process gone wrong. But you know, as an adolescent you also shed childhood potential to become the limited. But specialized and potentially useful thing that you will become. And so you might say, well, is it worth it? Is it worth shedding that potential? And Peter Pan's answer to that is, well no, he wants to remain in Neverland as a magical boy forever and he's King of the lost boys, which I would say is not a very. That's not much of a dominance hierarchy, right? It's like you're, you're the king king of the King of the losers, so to speak. People who can't get their act together and mature now.

Speaker 1:          02:42          And you notice in Peter Pan, peter pan doesn't grow up. He doesn't establish a relationship with Wendy who's actually real. He has to settle for Tinkerbell who is a ferry and they don't exist. And so she's really in some sense of figure of his imagination because he won't mature. He have an actual relationship with, with a genuine person. So he has to satisfy himself with while it's something like a pornographic fantasy actually. So seriously it is. It is like that. I mean, it's, it's, it's toned down a lot in the movie version obviously, but still, that's what's underlying it. Now you might say, well why doesn't Peter Pan want to grow up? And the answer is the only figure of authority that's around for him. His P, his captain hook, and he doesn't like Captain Hook. And that's because captain hook is a tyrant. He's brutal, you know, and he's also a coward because he's, he's lost a hand already to a crocodile with a clock in its stomach.

Speaker 1:          03:34          That's chaos and time, you know, that's the dragon that lives underneath everything. It's like the basset lists can Harry Potter and that Damn Crocodile's already got it. Piece of him, which is exactly the case. That crocodile has got a piece of me, you know, I'm older than 50 and so time is already got its grip on me. And you know, part of the problem of being adult is that you also have to take the fact that your finite and limited into account. And if you're terrified by that, which people tend to be, then it can easily turn you into a tyrant because you're afraid of everything or disgusted by everything and you have to ramp up the amount you control it. And so Peter Pan looks at Captain Hook and he thinks there's no damn way. That's what I want to end up as. So he's got a bad role model, you know. So Captain Hook and Stalin and this sort of devouring monster are good representations of the negative or tyrannical element of the great father. So that's the tyrannical element of the dominance hierarchy.
