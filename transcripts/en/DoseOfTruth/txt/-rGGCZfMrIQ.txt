Speaker 1:          00:07          First of all, one person can wreak an awful lot of havoc. There's absolutely no doubt about that. And as we get more technologically powerful, that becomes even more relevant and important and crucial. You know, one of the things that you said was that we had to wake up because we are too technologically powerful to be as morally asleep as we are and that seems to me just to be self evident. That's. Yeah, for sure. That's true. We're, we're, we're half asleep with nuclear bombs. It's not a good idea. It's seriously not a good idea.

Speaker 2:          00:37          And so.

Speaker 1:          00:41          Well, and then you might ask yourself too, you know, like what is the ultimate potential of a fully developed human being and well we certainly know that you have admiration for people who are more developed rather than less. That's, that just happens automatic or resentment that. But that's okay. It's the same thing. It doesn't matter, but it's not like you can identify that you can identify them and they're put forward to you in, in, in drama and fiction and all of that constantly. So that's another form of moral intuition. You know, you can read, you can discern the wheat from the chaff, let's say. And, and so the other thing that I was thinking about it's worth consideration too, is that, you know, and maybe this is, maybe this is petty, but I don't think it is.
