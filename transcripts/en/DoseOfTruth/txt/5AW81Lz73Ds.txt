Speaker 1:          00:06          Oh, the transhumanist would respond to that. You're just used to this idea of only living 80, 90 years and then you're done. Uh, that we would adjust to that. Well, maybe

Speaker 2:          00:17          the other question would be who would be the weed that would adjust to that?

Speaker 1:          00:24          Yes. You would no longer okay to get there. We would really no longer be human there. The idea of the transhumanist and singularitarian people is, is truly, you're not human anymore. We have brain, like the cochlear implant for hearing is a kind of brain transplant device. Well, they want to ramp that up and put chips in your cortex and you'd hit said essentially have Wikipedia in your brain. It's for instant access and so and, and so it, it would truly bring new meaning to what it means to be human.

Speaker 2:          00:53          Right. You could also argue that that's a form of death because if you transform yourself, so without it, you're unrecognizable. Then what? Where's the continuity with what you once were? You know, this is one of the reasons I have some real sympathy for many reasons. I have many reasons for this, but one of them that I have very much sympathy for. The idea, the Christian idea that's that's associated with the mortality of the resurrection of the body because the Christians insisted that this is not some sort of abstract life like it's, it's not uploaded into a computer. It's not blowing out all of your limitations. Now, you know, you might ask what the resurrected body would be and of course that's a particularly, that's a perfectly fine question, but it doesn't, it doesn't. That doesn't move you around the fact that there was a question that was really to be grappled with there because what the Christians were trying to do was to have their take and eat it too in some sense and to say, look, there's some out salute utility to the limitation that's imposed upon you by a mortal frame. Right. That's the characteristic element of being human and that perhaps there's a way of having that in transcending it up at the same time. Now what that would look like is obviously by, right.

Speaker 1:          02:08          I deal with that and Evan's on her to have a chapter on the soul and you know, post Descartes, Christians became more doulas before that they were more focused on the physical resurrection of the body. There are still some Christian sex today who think that they'll physically be resurrected but most more of them, most of them are do list and it's just your, it's just this kind of nonphysical thing that goes and, and be and is with God and Jesus and so on. Uh, but, but, but they actually debate this question of identity, the problem with identity because he say, well, if you're physically resurrected in heaven, what's, what's there? How old are you? And some of them actually have an answer. You're 30. That's like the ideal age physically I suppose mentally to be third and also Jesus was 30 maybe. Okay. So, but, but then the question is, is know, and I ask this question for the mindup loaders and the transhumanist, it's like there is no fixed self, first of all, all your cells near the ad, almost all the atoms in your body or recycle about every decade or so.

Speaker 1:          03:12          So there is no defined physical self of you. You know that theses ship, you replace all the wood and the ship, we still call it. It's the pattern structure. That was Schrodinger's term, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah. So, okay, so it's the pattern of information that is your memories, your memory cells, memory cells. Okay. Yeah, yeah. Okay. That's better. But at what age? You know, because I have memories now that I didn't have when I was 30 so what happens if I'm resurrected at age 30 where's all the memories of my last, I'm 63 now. The last 33 years of memories of that. I want those too. And so just okay, you can have all those memories, but wait, the memories I have now at 63 of when I was 30 are very different than the memories when I was 30 of of what I was like at that time.

Speaker 1:          03:58          And so there's no fixed set of memories even that represents you. Cause those are constantly edited and changed and reinterpret it. And it's like, okay, now I understand. When I had that 10 years as a bike racer in the 1980s I, you know, I was just sort of going through doing my thing and now I see in context what that meant for my life. But I didn't know it at the time. That's true for everything we do. That's why I always laugh when people write memoirs in their twenties or thirties. It's like how can you write a memoir? You don't have no idea what you're doing going now is going to meet in 30 years. And so in religious, so both, both scientific attempts at immortality mortality or the afterlife or whatever, and religious, they have the same problem. Uh, you know, what is up there that's being resurrected because there is no fixed self.

Speaker 1:          04:41          It's a constantly dynamic changing system. And then there's one more problem that I deal with the point of view self, the Pov cells, you know, there's uni looking out through your eyes and you Jordan go to sleep tonight. You wake up tomorrow morning and you're groggy for a few minutes but, but your, your point of view returns and you know the, the singularity people, they think, well, we'll copy all your memories and put them in a computer and it will turn it on and you'll wake up and you'll, you'll be looking out through the little camera hold. They're like Johnny Depp in transcendence and you'll be in there. No, I don't think so. Why would your point of view all of a sudden leap from your current body into the computer in the same sense that instead of sacrificing your brain and slicing it up and scanning, this is the current thoughts scanning every sinaps. What if in a hundred years from now we had a sophisticated Fmr I machine that could scan your brain and scan every single synapse and reproduce it. We had a computer big enough, Moore's law doubling and so on. It would be enough to just to reproduce your entire connectome and turned it up, but you're you Jordan Peterson, he's still standing there right next to the computer and they turn it on. You're not all of a sudden the absolute, well, there's other problems with that too, is that, you know, if I remember correctly, you

Speaker 2:          05:58          have more neurons in your autonomic nervous system then you have in your central nervous system.

Speaker 1:          06:04          Well,

Speaker 2:          06:05          what are you going to do about this man? And that isn't in your head,

Speaker 1:          06:10          not just your brain. So you have an extended buddy, so you ionics people, they love up the head. We're just going to clone your butt. Okay, this is getting too complex, but they really need the whole body.

Speaker 2:          06:20          Yes. Well that's again, that's the physical resurrection issue is that the idea that, and I think that you put your finger on the floor in the, in the, in the, in the new immortelle, in the new immortality crowd. You know, they think they really are [inaudible] and they think of your consciousness is something that's, well, they're confused about it in some sense because they think of it as a kind of soul, which would be a pattern. And that pattern is only instantiated in the brain. It's like, well, physiologically that's just not the case. It's like what about the hormones? What about like there's a look, there's a lot of things going on in the brain that aren't easily reducible to synaptic patterns, especially when you consider also its connection with the body and you have to consider that.
