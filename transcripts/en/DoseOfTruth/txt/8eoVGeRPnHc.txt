Speaker 1:          00:07          Did you please offer advice for individuals with high intelligence but low extroversion and low agreeableness and making and maintaining social connections and friendships? Well, I would, that's Roger, Roger. I would say make a plan. Again,

Speaker 1:          00:26          spend some time on it weekly. Go to things like meetups. There's a site called meetup.com that's a good place to meet people. Do whatever you have to do. Meet people, take a course, strike up a conversation, you know, and, and ask questions and listen that, that's particularly good. If you're low in agreeableness, um, people really like to be listened to. You know, you don't want to pester them with questions too badly, but you can get an awful long ways by listening to people and asking them questions. It's a, people hardly ever get listened to and they're so damn help, happy when you do it, that, um, that, that they're likely to open themselves up to you very, very rapidly. So get them talking. And when they say something, you don't quite catch your understand, ask them about it and, and that can help you move forward.

Speaker 1:          01:14          But put some time into it. Like you need to be going out at least once a week, um, and find some social places that you can go to regularly. That's another thing you can do, you know, was the pick a couple of hangouts, like a local bar or something like that or whatever. But go there regularly and say hi to the people who own it and run it. Then, you know, eventually you'll be irregular and then you can start to meet people by doing that. But, you know, it might take you two or three years to get good at it. Um, I've seen people go to go from being afraid to strike up a two to have a conversation with a friend in a, in a coffee shop, you know, like have a panic attack. Thinking about that to actually doing stand up comedy. So you can really move yourself along ways if you, if you make a long time plan.
