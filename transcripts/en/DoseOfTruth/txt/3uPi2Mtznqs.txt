Speaker 1:          00:07          Thank you. So, so let me ask you another question about that then. So she, one of the problems that I've had because I've been trying to look out at the, the potential for our true relationship between Islam and Christianity. You know, to the degree that I understand Islam or Christianity, which of course there's plenty to understand about both. So it's no easy thing to manage. But there is this claim as well that, that that's widespread and rather vague that that Islam is in essence a religion of peace. And, but when I look at the historical data, say stemming from Medina, the Medina time and then moving forward and the fact that Muhammad was definitely someone who engaged personally in warfare and in an expansionist warfare, it's not, it's not an easy thing for me to make the leap to uh, to comprehending or being able to accept the claim that the fundamental doctrines of Islam are peaceful, are, are, are associated with piece.

Speaker 1:          01:03          Because it looks to me like there's an element of it that's quite militaristic. And I've also thought that, let's say there's a religious element to Islam. And I mean this is not an original thought. Obviously there's a religious element to Islam, but there's also something that's clearly more like a political movement and more like a governmental movement. And that's also complicated by the fact that there isn't any clear separation between church and state in Islamic doctrine as far as I can tell. So when we hear claims that are, when claims are made that Islam is essentially a religion of peace, then that doesn't seem to be the case with the Medina end of the theological discourse or the actions that that emerged thereof. And then part of the problem is how do you reconcile that with the contradictions in relationship to the earlier, earlier, as you say, Meccan doctrines and it isn't clear to me how that can be done. So

Speaker 2:          01:53          mostly as a political community that the believers should. Of course, they are in that position today. Right? Right. That did not give you the lessons choice. He's insane. Or can have your brides are like, his message was you guys are Washington follow spots. These are items you live in a time and signals and I left the last message conveyed to you the light and enlightenment and come with me. No please. [inaudible] records. Lots of messages. It's the fact that cooking apply of course, fortunately the other end of the mixture attacker, the records described in Rosina, yes he does that

Speaker 3:          02:50          walk the wall.

Speaker 2:          02:53          The numbers were [inaudible] and these are people who come from of them. Then you see everywhere where people access as law, that is destination seniors live only after you accept Islam. As long as you refused to abide by Islamic law or accept to be subdued by Islam, you are at war. That's why they limit make this distinction between the House of Islam and the House of war. Right. And the House of war is everywhere where there are infidels and it's the job of the Muslims and the house of peace to convert.

Speaker 1:          03:31          So it's a religion of peace in so far as it's final utopian aim is the cessation of conflict, but it's the cessation of conflict in part as a consequence of of conquest. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Well, that was more or less how I understood it. So when the claim is made that it's a religion of peace, then that isn't precisely, it's, it's a slight of hand in some sense. With regards specifically to that phrase.
