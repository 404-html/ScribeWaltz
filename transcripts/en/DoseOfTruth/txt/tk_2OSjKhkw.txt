Speaker 1:          00:06          Should artists wastes their time in art school? No, you shouldn't waste your time ever. I think your question is, is it necessarily a waste of time to go to art school? And I would say it depends very much on the art school and they're on what you do while you're there. Um, if you go to art school and you really work at it like mad and you devote yourself to it and you're in the library and you're studying the great masters and you're crafting your technique and you're at a school where that's actually possible, then you can educate yourself and going to art school can give you an identity that allows you to investigate that possibility free from undue social pressure for some period of time, which is really the case with an arts degree or something like that as well. So if you can take advantage of it, if you're disciplined enough and if you can find a school that isn't completely appallingly postmodern and and social justice oriented instead of oriented towards art, then I don't think it has to be a waste of time. But I think there's a high probability that it will.
