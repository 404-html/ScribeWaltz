Speaker 1:          00:00          Hmm,

Speaker 1:          00:07          among the youngest as the approach maturity go through a hysterical or history crisis, but sometimes their vocation manifests itself at an earlier age. The boy runs away into the mountains and remains there for a week or more feeding on animals, which he terrorists to pieces with his teeth. He returns to the village filthy bloodstained, and it's only after 10 or more days that have passed that he began to babble incoherent words. The strange behavior of future showman's has not failed to attract the attention of scholars and from the middle of the past century, several attempts have been made to explain the phenomena as a mental disorder, but the problem was wrongly put four. On the one hand, it is not true that showman's always are always have to be neuropathic, mentally deranged. On the other hand, and this is the critical issue, those among them who had been healed become shamans precisely because they had succeeded in becoming cured.

Speaker 1:          00:57          So it was not the descent into this strange subterranean psychological state that constitutes the transformation that makes the showman, but it's the emergence back out of that and that's a journey to the underworld and a and a rebirth. Right? And so, and there's this great book, this is a great book by a guy named Henri Ellenberger Shay, and he was an existential, a psychoanalyst and philosopher, and he wrote a book called the discovery of the unconscious, which I would highly recommend it. It's on my list of recommended readings. It is a great book if you want to know about the psychoanalytic tradition, uh, it's the best introduction there is. And he discusses Adler and young and Freud and does a very credible job of all three but also takes the history of psychoanalytic thought back three or 400 years before Freud. And so it's very engaging, reading and, and, and, and very interesting.

Speaker 1:          01:50          And one of the things Ellenberg shape points out quite clearly is, and, and he associates this to some degree with the shamanic tradition that both Freud and young, young in particular underwent very intense periods of psychological disturbance. Let's say, and I would say what was happening is that because they were questioning their axioms at the most fundamental level, they were deranging their cognitive and perceptual structures, right, and young was also experimenting with imaginative techniques, with visionary techniques which he, which he did lot and there was a period of his life where he was having constant, a constant stream of visions which you wrote down in a book called the red book, but at the same time he was still functioning as a psychiatrist and operating normally in the world and so people have suggested that what he had was a psychotic break. But that's ridiculous because you don't don't.

Speaker 1:          02:41          That's not how it works, man. If you're having a psychotic break, you, you're not being an effective psychiatrist. Those things do not go together, especially not for a long period of time. And so there, there's the possibility of extreme experience without cyclocross psychopathology. And so, um, and Elena Bursa, he just, he says much the same thing about Freud and about Charles Darwin as well, who underwent a terrible period of, of, of mental confusion, I would say, as a consequence of formulating his theory of evolution, which was really hard on him because he was a, he was a die hard Christian and he knew what he knew, what the implications of his theory word. He didn't know what to do about that, you know, so it was very, very hard on him. So it's quite common for people of genius to go through an intense crisis, psychological crisis, but then resolve that.

Speaker 1:          03:32          And the genius is in the resolution, right? The precondition for the genius is the dissolution in some sense because you have to be obsessed with a problem. It has to grip you completely before you're going to concentrate on it. So obsessively that you might come up with a solution. But it's the people who come up with a solution that are the prophets in the Sharmane and so forth and so on and, and, and so that's not. This isn't something that only characterizes our cultures. We just don't recognize it in our own culture properly and, and that's a problem. Well, sometimes we do. Right? You remember that in, in, in the lion king, right? That Rafiki shows up. He's the chairman. He, he, he brings, he brings up Simba down that tunnel dark tunnel. That's the dark night of the soul. He has them reflect upon himself and a pool.

Speaker 1:          04:19          When he reflects upon himself, deeply sees the reflection of his father, then that becomes a thing of cosmic significance. And his father appears in the sky just like God appears to Jacob and basically tells them that it's time for him to grow the hell up and to return to the devastated kingdom and to set it right. You know, and so and that's right. That's exactly right. I mean, we live in the devastated kingdom. That's an eternal truth and it's the responsibility of the individual to grow the hell up and to set it right because when it's devastated and when things are not in place, then everyone suffers too much and that's not good. And there's no excuse for not doing something about it because you don't have anything better to do so. And even like children's movies tell you this.
