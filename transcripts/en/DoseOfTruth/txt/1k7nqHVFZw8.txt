Speaker 1:          00:10          Those things have to be pretty extreme to have an effect, and those effects may not be permanent studies, deprivation of people who suffered deprivation during the Second World War, uh, that suggest that those really severe deprivations didn't have lasting effects on tough. So I'm inclined to agree with that.
