Speaker 1:          00:10          What happens in the shop manic experiences that Scherman has the experience of being reduced to a skeleton first. So death, a death experience on very realistic death experience. And then the next thing that happens is that he finds himself in a place where he's communing with his ancestor, the ancestral spirits. And then after that there's the climbing of something like the ladder, Jacob's ladder say, and an encounter with God for all intents and purposes. And uh, it's very widespread, um, phenomena.
