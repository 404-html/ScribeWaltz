Speaker 1:          00:07          Postmodern view is like the hobbs of view in some sense, except you want to replace the individual with, with, with pyramids of, of social organization, so hierarchies of social organization that are based on group identity, um, and the landscape in which those pyramids exists is one of unbroken enmity and inability to communicate. So it's a very dark view as far as I'm concerned and I think it's fundamentally wrong and in many ways, I mean it's right in that there are groups of people and there is some difficulty in communication between them. And that power is an element in the formation of hierarchies, but you can't reduce hierarchy or group relationship to those premises. It's too simplified because people also cooperate. We're also not groups. Men, we, many of us belong to many groups, so it's to the actual situation is far too complex to reduce it to that degree, to reduce it to that degree.

Speaker 1:          01:11          Even though you can come up with a good explanatory story if you do so, it doesn't capture the nuances and they're not just nuances. It doesn't capture the essence. Now, the thing is is that when you make the presupposition that the reason that hierarchies exist is because of power, then essentially what you do is turn to every hierarchy into a tyranny. And so if you, if there is a hierarchy, then you assume it's a tyranny. Well, that's really the patriarchy. The Patriarchy is hierarchy assumed as tyranny, and that's also just not true except in pathological hierarchies. So for example, we know from the psychological literature that the best predictors of longterm life success, our intelligence and conscientiousness in western countries at least. Well, that's what you'd hope for it, right? More or less, if you, if you want to even just set up a society, even if you weren't particularly smart or hard working, you might want to set up a society where intelligence and hard work, we are good predictors of success because then the people who were smart and hardworking would produce a bunch of things that you could have if you could trade for them.

Speaker 1:          02:14          And of course that is actually the situation that most of us are in. So, and of course the other thing about people who believed that hierarchies in the West are only composed of of power and tyranny is that their own actions belie that because whenever they make a decision to interact with that hierarchy, they attempt or to make a purchase or or to make a trade, let's say, or to obtain a service, a service of any importance, let's say a medical service, they are going to definitely act as if there are less and more competent people within that hierarchy and seek out the ones that are more competent obviously, which you don't do if the. If the hierarchy is only composed of tyranny and power, there's no point looking for. But anyways, in the west and in functioning societies, hierarchies are basically predicated on competence and not power.

Speaker 1:          03:06          And and you might say, well that's pretty naive. It's like, no, actually it's not very naive. I'm not saying at all that inappropriate power plays don't play a role in corrupting hierarchies of competence. That happens, but generally what happens is if the hierarchies of competence get corrupted enough by power, then they crumble because they can no longer function. So, and the, you know, the evidence that are hierarchies of competence. Work is everywhere because everything around us works all the time ion hers. The two interesting stories in her book, infidel, which is a great book by the way, um, she came from Africa and from a country that wasn't very functional and when she came to Holland she said there were two things that really amazed her, um, and this really struck me because, you know, now, and then you get lucky and you can see the, the world you live in from an outsider's perspective, right?

Speaker 1:          03:56          You get to see through someone else's eyes. Um, she said the first thing that knocked her off her feet was waiting for a bus and in Amsterdam and on the, you know, she's standing at the bus stop and there's a pole there and there's digital sign on the pole and the digital sign says when the next bus is going to come and counts down. And then when it hits zero, the bus appears and she, she just, she just, she absolutely could not believe that that would happen, that there could be a sign that told you when the bus would come and that it would change and the bus would actually appear and you think, well, yeah, no, that's a miracle man. That's an absolute miracle. It is. It is. You got to think that through, you know, the amount of timing and organization and, and, and, and reliability, mechanical reliability and sociological or social organization and dedication on the part of the bus drivers and the entire company and the Organization of the whole city and the state to make that possible is absolutely beyond belief, especially when it's time to, well perhaps not the second but to 10 seconds or something like that.

Speaker 1:          05:00          That is absolutely beyond belief and her inability to comprehend. That was the correct response. And then the other things she was amazed by was that you could go talk to policemen and they would help you. That was just, that was just a no go for her because for her, her experience was policemen were there to shake you down and and hurt you, and so you think, well, you know, well, I won't. I won't dwell on that point any longer. The point is, is that it's absolutely ridiculous, blind to make the assumption that the hierarchies in functioning Western democracies are fundamentally predicated on power and tyranny.
