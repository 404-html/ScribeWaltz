Speaker 1:          00:10          Specialized sub circuits and they're variable in their expression. And what that basically means is that on average across people, they're likely to be located in the same place. Now there's, there's, there's some discrepancies cause lefthanders are different than right handers and people also have mixed dominance. And so their brains can be organized in ways that are not exactly cononical. So we're saying roughly speaking, and it extends, it extends in some weird ways to phenomena that you wouldn't necessarily think could possibly be organized in that manner. So for example, the part of the brain that you use for silent reading and the visual Cortex is back here. And then the auditory cortex is about here. And then the part of the brain that you use for silent reading is where the auditory and the visual cortex overlap. So that's pretty cool. So what it means is that you look at words and you'll hear them because your eyes are using the auditory cortex as a representational structures.

Speaker 1:          01:09          That's pretty cool. And so it turns out that people who silent read pretty much used the same brain area to do that. And so you might think about that as biological preparedness in some sense. But of course, people didn't learn to read silently til 500 years ago, roughly speaking. You know, even the earliest literate people, most of them read out loud, silent reading was a very, very rare phenomenon. Julius Caesar could read silently and people thought that that was part of his magical power because it's, well, it's pretty damn weird. You know, that you can use your eyes to here, you know, cause you can all do it. You think, yeah, anybody can do that. But you know, it's a pretty new thing on the evolutionary horizon. And to be able to hear with your eyes, it's like good work guys. That's, that's not an easy thing to manage.
