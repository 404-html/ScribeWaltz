Speaker 1:          00:00          Hmm,

Speaker 1:          00:07          so back to discuss, to discuss. So I'm. So the fundamental thing that I learned from Paul Rosin is to see us as these amazing omnivores. This is part of our survival strategy even more than other other apes. We are just brilliant omnivores and we have the Omnivore's dilemma, which is we've got to be interested in all kinds of new stuff. We're not tied to one place. We can roam onto a whole new continent. So we were interested in stuff, but stuff has all kinds of toxins and microbes. We have to be careful about that stuff. And so these motives have to be intention and this is actually an interesting way to understand the left right? Difference. You have to have both motives, but if so imagined two siblings, one of whom is set more towards trying new stuff, seeking out new stuff, and the other is a little more fearful and we're like, Whoa, no, let's, you know, let's not try that.

Speaker 1:          00:55          That stay with what's tried and true. I mean that's progressivism and conservatives and that's the origins of it. And if you look at kids' behavior at the age of two or three, it does predict how it will vote much later. Not Hugely, but there is a clear prediction there. So, um, so disgust is part of a regulatory system about our engagement with the world and whether we are just sorta out there and, you know, we, we, we seek out variety and diversity. I think diversity is just a great thing or whether we want a little more order structure, predictability. Conservatives are neater than a progressive's if you take photos of their rooms, um, um, you know, you can actually use the cleanliness and organization. You can predict how they vote, um, discussed. It turns out what's really cool about disgust in modern politics is if you look at all the different things that we're fighting over, especially in this country, our culture wars over, you know, going back a few decades, you know, sex, drugs, the flag, immigration, all of these things.

Speaker 1:          01:54          Um, I have a study with my colleagues was led by Seneca Leyva, um, in which we asked all these cultural war attitudes of people. And we also had their scores. And the discus scale, but one of the foundations of morality is sanctity and purity and it relates to discuss. What we found is that if you know, if you know what people's left, right, how they place themselves in the left rightscale, you can pretty much predict where they fall on most cultural war attitudes except for those that load on or implicate sanctity or purity. So what I mean his flag burning. Okay. Do you think, you know, do you think that people should have the right to burn the American flag or country's flag as an expression, as a political action? What do you think people can give some answer in a one to seven scale and people on the right?

Speaker 1:          02:40          Think more like the say no. People on the left, yes. People who score high on loyalty are more likely to say no. People who have low run it say yes, and that's even taking account of where they are on the left right dimension. But here's the cool thing. Um, it's only if you add in the purity or sanctity thing, but you can really understand what people are doing because people see the flag not as just a piece of cloth. They see it as having some innate essence, some something sacred about it which must be protected. And so, um, so this is true. They think of it as a unifying center. Exactly. That's right. So if there's something sacred, and this is the, this is the central piece of my work around politics and morality is the psychology of sanctity.
