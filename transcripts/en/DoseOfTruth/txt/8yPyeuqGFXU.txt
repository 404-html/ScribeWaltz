Speaker 1:          00:01          So anyways, you can think from the phenomenological viewpoint of your experience as a whole instead of you being a subject in an objective world. And so here's another way of. Here's something that's quite useful. [inaudible] talked about this because he was moving towards a phenomenological perspective later in his life. The last book he wrote was called mysterium conjunction us and he talked about three conjunctions that needed to take place in order for someone to be well constituted psychologically. And you know how piaget talked about learning that you could not only follow rules but that you could make rules for new games as sort of the highest level of moral development. I would say you extended the Piagetian moral continuum up past what piaget had envisioned. Now he didn't. He didn't do that because he wasn't trying to extend piaget's model, but. But you can think about it the same way and it's not easy to come up with a moral motive being say, that transcends the ability to make rules for new games.

Speaker 1:          01:02          That's damn smart man. That's, that's, that's a major home run by piaget as far as I'm concerned. But Young said something like this said, look, when you're going through the process of psychological integration, here's a way of conceptualizing it, and he thought about this as symbolically as male, female pairings, because as I've tried to point out the most, one of the most fundamental character categories that are mythological imagination uses to structure the world is the category of masculine and feminine. And it moves that around. You know, it's, it's a fundamental metaphor. So you can move that around anywhere. And so young thought, well, one of the things that you're trying to do is to get your thoughts and your emotions integrated. And so, you know, the Classic Enlightenment Viewpoint, roughly speaking, is something like passion is the enemy of reason, right? And so to the degree that your rational, it's sort of afraid of viewpoint.

Speaker 1:          01:57          It's because he got your emotions under control and there's some truth in that, but not enough truth. I like the psg an idea better, which is that, no, no, that isn't what happens. What happens if you're playing the proper game is that you integrate your emotions underneath. You're thinking something like that. So they're all working in the same direction, you know. So for example, you can make your anxiety work against you or for you. And one of the ways I get it, I made a program called the future authoring program that I think helps people do that because one of the things you see when you're talking to people and they're trying to solve problems is that they're afraid to face the problem and so then their anxiety is working against them and you can think about it as a, as antagonistic to rationality, but then I could say, well, why don't you think for awhile about what your life would be like if you didn't face this problem?

Speaker 1:          02:49          Because if you think that through, if you have a problem and you really think through what the consequences are going to be in three to five years of not facing it, then you're going to get more afraid of not it then facing it. And that's great because then your anxiety, instead of standing in front of you, instead of you having a dragon guarding the path in front of you, will you have one chasing you down the path from behind? That's a lot more useful. And so you know, that's just a minimal example of the utility of getting your emotions and your and your thoughts aligned the same way. The same thing happens with aggression. You know, one of the most common reasons that people come and seek psychotherapy really is because they're too agreeable. But what that means is they're not assertive enough. They haven't integrated their capacity for aggression and so other people can push them around and, and there are very conflict avoidant and and so the consequences of that across time is that you don't stand up for yourself well enough and you get taken advantage of and that spirals badly downward.

Speaker 1:          03:51          And so partly what you do when you're doing assertiveness training with people is you find out what they're angry about and there are usually angry, angry if they're not assertive enough because other people are taking advantage of them or you could say because they're not putting their own necessities forward with enough force. It's hard to distinguish between those two things. But anyways, you know, you get them to talk about what they're angry about that often makes them cry often many times. And then you get them to kind of envision what they would want to have instead, which they're often afraid to do because people are afraid to think about what they want because that makes it more clear when they're not getting it. And that's painful, right? Or maybe they're afraid of hoping so they won't specify a clear aim. But anyways, you get them to think about what they might want.

Speaker 1:          04:39          Instead you get them to think about the costs of not pursuing that. And then you help them develop strategies for integrating their aggression and with their thinking so that they can come up with a plan to approach the world. In a more confident way, so for example, someone might come to me and say, I'm being bullied badly at work, and so then I'll say, well, what are your options? You have to put up with it. Well, we'll, we'll figure that out because maybe you do. Maybe you don't have options, but here's how to find out. Get your damn cv together so it's pristine, right? It's, it's ready to go. Get over your fear of a new interview because it people are generally afraid of that. Get over your fear of applying for a new job. Start thinking about what it would mean to have a different job.

Speaker 1:          05:24          Start thinking about what it would mean to have a better job even because maybe your fear is just making you stuck here, but I can tell you one thing. If someone's picking on you at work and you don't have options, you lose so you get the person to start building a strategy. It's like, okay, if you're going to tell this person to stop, you have to know how to make them stop and one and the one thing you need for sure is an option. And if you can't, if you don't have an option, then maybe we start thinking about the fact that you need some more training or something like that because you cannot negotiate if you don't have any power. So because while, especially if you're dealing with someone who's really out to get you or really disagreeable, if you don't have a leg to stand on, they'll just push you over and maybe they'll jump on youtube because that's what they're like and they enjoy it anyway.

Speaker 1:          06:10          So it's no joke. So you put your options behind you and then you start to think about strategy. So I tell people, look, if you're being harassed at work, you documented every time it happens and you write it down so you've got like 20 stories about it and it's fully documented and then you go confront the person at some point, but with at least three pieces of evidence and you have some sense of what you tell them about what will happen if they don't stop. So you have to figure out, well, if they don't stop, what are you gonna do about it? Leave. Not if you can't leave. So you, you have to be able to wield a big stick and speak softly, but you see that way. It's. That's how you take your aggression, which is an absolutely necessary part of your psyche and manifest it up into a sophisticated means of dealing with the world.

Speaker 1:          06:59          You don't just suppress it. You say, well, I should be able to put up with it, or I wish I wasn't so angry or something. It's like, forget that. That's all that'll happen is your blood pressure will stay high and you'll die of a heart attack. Because anger for example, is a very toxic emotion and it does cause heart damage over time. It's the only emotion that we really know that's been linked to things like cardiovascular risk and anger is is toxic because it's like you're driving a car. You've. You're stepping on the gas and pushing on the brake at the same time because anger tells you to run away and to attack at the same time because you don't know what's gonna happen and so it. It really amps up the physiological demand on your body. And so if you are including your heart and your musculature, so if you stay like that for like 10 years, you know you're going to age 20 years and that's a bad plan.
