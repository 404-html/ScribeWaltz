Speaker 1:          00:00          So the question was, um, positive emotions mediated by dopamine. When you're advancing towards something, say, or when you have a cue that something good is about to happen, what is the system that mediates positive emotion at the satiation level?

Speaker 2:          00:16          Yup. Yup.

Speaker 1:          00:20          Okay. Okay. Well, let's start with the satiation issue that seems most deregulated by Serotonin. The opiate issue is there are other forms of specific reward that don't seem to be merely motivated or merely underpinned by dopamine. And the opiate system would be one of those. There's an oxytocin system as well. So there are other biochemical systems that are involved in more specific forms of reward. But the thing that's common among instances that make it appear that you're moving forward is the dopaminergic element, roughly speaking. And then one of the things that happens if you're higher in Serotonin because you're more dominant, is that you're more satiated all the time. That's why people who are low in the dominance hierarchy with decreased levels of Serotonin are more impulsive and also more emotionally dysregulated. They're more impulsive because, hey, you take your positive thing when you can get it.

Speaker 2:          01:22          Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:22          And so they're, they're more dissatisfied. They're more looking for anything that will produce a positive outcome. And then they're also more likely to experience diffused negative emotion. Partly because their serotonin systems are lower, indicating their tenuous status in the dominance hierarchy. Meaning that everything they do that's uncertain is far more dangerous.

Speaker 1:          01:47          So this is also why it's very difficult often when you're trying to treat someone who's depressed. Because you could say there's not much difference between being depressed and existing in the biochemical state. That being at the bottom of the dominance hierarchy would produce. In fact they're the same thing. Well then the question is, are you depressed or are you just at the bottom of a dominance hierarchy? Because those are not that like the, the symptomatology is very, very similar. But the cause and the cure are not the same. You know, cause you might be at the bottom of the dominant Turkey because you're just, everything about your life is ruined. So, and of course your suffering. Are you depressed? No, not exactly. You just have nowhere to go. So other questions? Yes.

Speaker 2:          02:42          Pursue Muller. They don't produce this residence.

Speaker 1:          02:50          Okay. So the question is, why don't, why do people pursue rewards that don't produce this resonance? They don't have a value hierarchy. So pleasure. It's a good example. Those kids that were brought there were lost. So they didn't, they didn't have anywhere to go. They didn't have an identity. So they default to local pleasure, and that's better than none. Although the problem with local pleasure, wild as the narrative made clearer is that you better look out if you're impulsive because it's going to kick back on your heart. And the reason is you're only considering the immediate timeframe. And the problem is, is that things propagate across all the timeframes. And so just because something works really well, this second cocaine for example, doesn't mean that it's a tenable solution to the class of all problems. So usually, often people pursue local pleasure because that's the best they can imagine.

Speaker 1:          03:48          It's the best they've been taught. They don't see another alternative. So it could be ignorance. It can be, they don't want to adopt the responsibility because part of the problem with working at every level of the hierarchy simultaneously is that it's, it's, well, it's like dancing to a very complex waltz, let's say. You have to be paying attention to a very large number of things simultaneously and doing things right. It requires responsibility. And so you know, that's, it's a pain. It's a weight. Part of the reason people drink alcohol is to get rid of their responsibility. I mean that's, you know, you hear people drink because they have problems. It's like, yeah, yeah, no. Some people drink because they're anxious and alcoholics drink because they're in withdrawal. But young people drink because they're sick and tired of being responsible because it's annoying. It's like, so I'll drink enough. I won't care about the medium to longterm consequences because alcohol, that's exactly what alcohol does. It doesn't make you ignorant of the medium to longterm consequences, but it makes you not care about them. And partly it's because it dampens anxiety, so it dampens anxiety, leaves your positive emotion circuits intact. So then you can go out there and do stupid, fun things. And that's like, that's a party really. Let's go do stupid fun things. That's a party. But the medium to longterm consequences are,

Speaker 1:          05:14          it's risky. It doesn't mean you shouldn't do it, but it's risky. So yeah, they don't know better. That's the answer I would say. So yes.

Speaker 2:          05:26          Well, if you're talking about responsibility, it seems like that balance of person to a certain frame.

Speaker 1:          05:35          Now that's why conservatives and liberals don't get along because conservatives do bind themselves to a particular frame and they're conscientious and low and openness. And the Liberals say, doesn't that just bind you to a particular frame? And it's like, yeah, that that's, it does. And that's a problem. So yes,

Speaker 2:          05:54          but in terms of being aware of the multiple levels, um, it takes within a frame, it takes a certain amount of tolerance of the unbearable present for that to reach the edge of that frame, to force a person to see a different frame. Because that's something that sentence.

Speaker 1:          06:13          Yes. And that's, that's actually where I stopped today because that's a, that's exactly right. So you're, you're, it's good because both the questions you asked indicated that you're sort of at the next step in the, in the logic process. Cause you asked about the relationship between these frames with, with, you know, in relationship to one another and that is the next issue. It's like

Speaker 2:          06:32          there's something about responsibility and individuality, but I'm curious about responsibility implies a connection to other people. Okay.

Speaker 1:          06:39          Well what are the things, one of the things we are going to talk about in the classes is how you address the problem that you just described, which is that this is the Peter Pan Story, roughly speaking is Peter Pan is this magical boy pan means pan is the god of everything roughly speaking. Right. And so it's not an accident that he has the name Pat and he's the boy that won't grow up and he's magical. Well that's because children are magical. They can be anything. They're nothing but potential. And Peter Pan doesn't want to give that up. Why? Well, he's got some adults around them, but the main adult is captain hook. Well who the hell wants to grow up to be captain? Hark. First of all, you've got a hook. Second year a tyrant and third you're chased by the dragon of chaos with a clock in its stomach, right?

Speaker 1:          07:28          The crocodile, it's already got a piece of view. Well that's what happens when you get older. Time has already got a piece of you and eventually it's got a taste for you and eventually it's going to eat you. And so hook is so traumatized by that that he can't help but be a tyrant. And then Peter Pan looks out traumatized Herc and says, well no, I'm not sacrificing my childhood for that. So that's fine, except he ends up killing in lost boys. It never loud. Well, Neverland doesn't exist and who the hell wants to be king of the lost boys? And he also sacrifices the possibility that to help it real relationship with a woman, because that's Wendy Wright and she's kind of conservative middle class London dwelling girl. She wants to grow up and have kids and have a life. She accepts her mortality, she accepts her maturity.

Speaker 1:          08:17          Peter Pan has to contend himself with Tinkerbell. She doesn't even exist. She's like, she's like the fairy of porn. She doesn't exist. She's the substitute for the real thing. And so, but the dichotomy that you're talking about, it's very tricky because there's a sacrificial element in maturation, right? You have to sacrifice the pleura potentiality of childhood for the actuality of a frame. And the question is, well, why would you do that? Well, one reason is it happens to you whether you do it or not, you can either choose your damn limitation or you can let it take you unaware when you're 30 or even worse when you're 40 and then that is not a happy day. You see, I see people like this, and I think it's more and more common in our culture because people can put off Matt maturity without suffering and immediate penalty.

Speaker 1:          09:12          But all that happens is the penalty accrues. And then when it finally hits, it just wallops you. Because when you're 25 you could be an idiot. It's no problem. Even when you're out in a job search, it's like, well, you don't have any experience in. You're kind of clueless. It's, yeah, yeah, you're young. You know? It's no problem. We can, that's what young people are like, but they're full of potential. Okay, well now you're the same person at 30 it's like people aren't so thrilled about you at that point. It's like what the hell have you been doing for the last 10 years? Well, I'm just as clueless as I was when I was 22 it's, yeah, but you're not 22 you're an old infant. Right? And that's an ugly thing and old infant. So they, the reason, part of the reason you choose your damn sacrifice because the sacrifice is inevitable, but at least you get to choose it.

Speaker 1:          10:00          And then there's something that's even more complex than that in some sense is that the problem with being a child is that all you are is potential and it's really low resolution. You could be anything but you're not anything. So then you go and you do adopt an apprenticeship, roughly speaking, and then you become at least you become something. And when you're something that makes the world opened up to you again. You know, like if you're a really good plumber, then you end up being far more than a plumber, right? You end up being a good employer. Not, not that plumbers, I'm not putting plumbers town. It's like more power to plumbers. They've saved more lives than doctors. So hygiene, right? So you know, if you're a really good plumber, well then you have some employees, you run a business, you, you, you make you, you train some other people, you enlarge their lives.

Speaker 1:          10:48          You're kind of a pillar of the community. You, you have your family. It's, you can, once you pass through that narrow training period, which narrows you and constricts you and develops you at the same time, then you can come out the other end with a bunch of new possibility at hell at hand. And you haven't talked about that. A thought that the proper part of the proper path of development in the last half of life was to rediscover the child that you left behind as you were apprenticing. And so then you get to be something and regain that potential at the same time. Very, very smart. While he was very, very smart. So that's very wise, very wise thing to know.
