Speaker 1:          00:07          Dr. Peterson, I'm really hoping you can share your thoughts on the day. Just shooting. Yeah. Well, what I would do is recommend the biblical lecture I did on Cain and Abel, I would say, because I think that that's a good summary of the state of mind that somebody has to be in in order to do what was done at Los Vegas. So you have to be very, very embittered by life in order to do that sort of thing. And you have to be searching for revenge, I would say. And it's not, you know, you might think, well, it's only revenge on other people because you've developed hatred for people, but it's deeper than that. It's not just hatred for people. I would say it's hatred for being itself and, and the desire to take revenge on being for the outrage of the tragedy and suffering that's associated with being, um, and maybe the tragedy and suffering that's being part and parcel of your own life.

Speaker 1:          01:04          And that makes you embittered. And then past embittered becomes outraged and past outrage becomes well homicidal or even genocidal. And that's a terrible state of mind to begin. It's a hellish state. Um, I believe that the best way to conceptualize the state of mind that someone has to be at in order to do something like the Columbine shootings for example, or what happened in Las Vegas is that you're really an, now you have to speak about it and religious languages. You're really out for revenge against God, for the outrage of creation. That's what it looks like to me. And that's a state of mind that's truly hellish and you could get there by broody long enough. Now it's also possible, I mean this guy didn't have any previous history, criminal history or anything like that and he's pretty old. So you know, there's also also also the possibility of some kind of neurological pathology that that might be characteristic of him.

Speaker 1:          01:57          You know, some degenerative neurological disease. There was a kid years ago at the University of Texas at Austin who climbed up on the tower there and shot a number of people with a high powered rifle and he had a fast growing tumor on his hypothalamus and had reported like these being overcome with extreme feelings of rage. And so that's another possibility. But I would say the, uh, embitterment hypothesis is the strongest one. I would also say too, I noticed the Steven Pinker tweeted this today, is that one of the ways of controlling this sort of thing would be for the press to agree, not for there to be a blanket agreement, not to publicize the name or any other identity markers of the people who do the shooting. Because there's also this really, what would you call it? Arrogance. It's a kind of arrogance and pride last ditch, arrogance and pride that that is associated with the fantasies that drive this sort of behavior.

Speaker 1:          02:57          And the fantasy is like, well, after I do this, everyone will sure know the who, who the hell I was. You know, even though maybe I was ignored or unhappy when I was alive after I'm dead, everybody's going to know who I was and what idea did you know? So there's this underground desire for fame, I guess it's notoriety, but notoriety might be preferable to being ignored. And so, you know, there's a lot of talk about gun control and that's understandable, especially with regards to automatic rifles. Um, although I also understand why the people who are gun owners are afraid of, of, of, um, allowing what they regard as one of their fundamental rights to be infringed upon. But it would certainly be useful if we stop giving people who do this sort of thing, not $100 million worth of free publicity and all the notoriety they can manage. So, you know, that's another way of thinking about controlling it. So

Speaker 2:          03:55          yeah,

Speaker 3:          03:55          one of the things you'll see if, if, if you're interested in this sort of thing, if you ever go read the writings of, of the Columbine killers that the teens, they're very interesting. They're very much worth reading, especially I think it's Dylan Klebold who was the more literate of the, of the two. But he tells you exactly where he went after brooding and brooding and brooding on his, his isolation and segregation from mankind. So he's out there beyond, he's out there in a chaotic domain and because he's tortured by that, his thoughts taken unbelievably dark turn, like it's unimaginably dark. Um, if you're interested in that sort of thing, you could read that. There's another book you could read called Pans, Ram, p, a, N, zed, r, a, m. And it's a fascinating book. It's about this guy who I think he raped 1200 men. So that sort of tells you what sort of guy he was extraordinarily physically powerful and brutal and malevolent.

Speaker 3:          04:48          And he was kind of a juvenile delinquent type and they put them in a reform school and he was not well treated it. Now in reform school, it's sorta like the worst of the Canadian residential schools. And when he came out, he was not a happy boy. And so he spent the rest of his life trying to be as destructive as he could possibly imagine and purely consciously with malevolent intent. And then, and, and believe me, he was pretty destructive. He kept track of the dollar value of all the buildings he burned down. He tried to start a war between Britain and the United States. Like he was an all out for all out may ham, his dying words, they are going to hang him. Um, he told the guy who was going to hang them too. He said, hurry up you who's your bastard? I could kill 12 man in the time it takes you to hang me.

Speaker 3:          05:34          And that's exactly the sort of person he was. And he made friends with this physician in the, in the prison who he thought was like the first person who ever did something nice for them, gave them a dollar for cigarettes if I remember correctly. And the physician encouraged him to write his autobiography. And so we did. And it's available. And so if you want a view, because you know you, you always think of people, you think well people have good intentions, you know that you specially things out if you're naive and agreeable. So all of you who are sitting there out there thinking people have good intentions, you're probably high in agreeableness, but that's not always the case. People can have very dark motivations that are fully conscious and very well elaborated and pans around was no, he was smart and his book is very well written and he tells you exactly why he thought the way he thought.

Speaker 3:          06:23          And so it's a good glimpse of exactly this sort of thing where you can get to if you want to buy brooding on your specific misfortune. You know, in his, his basic credo was that human beings were so reprehensible that they should just be eliminated and believe me, that's what he was trying to do. And these people who do terrible things like the Columbine shooters, that's exactly what, for lack of a better word, they're possessed by it's sheer malevolence. And the Columbine kids had a much more spectacular catastrophe plan than the one that actually occur. And they knew it was going to be a full blown media circus. And lots of these people who engage in these sorts of mass murders, they know about the other mass murderers and they're engaged in a competition. And the competition is who can do the most brutal thing the fastest, something like that. So you can't just be thinking about people who've, you know, who have good intentions, but if somehow gone wrong, if you ever meet someone who isn't like that and you think that you're just a tree with ripe fruit to be plucked.
