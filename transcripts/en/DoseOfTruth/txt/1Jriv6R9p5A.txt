Speaker 1:          00:06          Yes, authentic leftism is populous. It is based in working class style, working class language, working class, direct emotional openness and brushing stuff. Speech. Okay. Not this fancy, contorted jargon of this udall leftist of academe who are fraud. These people, these people who managed to manage to rise to the top and at Berkeley and Harvard and Princeton. Okay. Do you have any of these people are radical? They are career people. Their corporate types. Okay. Then who like who succeeded in it? They love the institutional contacts. They know how to manipulate the bureaucracy, which is totally invaded in usurped. Okay. The academe everywhere. Okay. These people are company polit players. They could have done well in any, any field. They love to sit in endless committees. They loved bureaucratic regulation and so on. There's not one, not one leftist. Okay. And American academe raised his or her voice against obscene growth.

Speaker 1:          01:01          Growth tuition costs which have bankrupted a whole generation of young people. Not, not one voice. Okay. To challenge that. That that invasion by the bureaucrats. Okay. Actual fascist bureaucrats. Okay. Well, if we added the cancer risks. Okay. There are so many of them because the faculty have completely lost any power in American academia. Okay. It's us. It's a scandal. What has happened. Okay. And they deserve the president's servitude that they're in right now. Okay. Because they never protested. When I. my first job at Bennington College, Ninety, 76. I was there when there was an uprising by the faculty against encroachment, by the board of trustees and the president. Okay. And it was a huge thing. It was, it was. It was reported on the New York Times and so on. And we. And we pushed that precedent out. Okay. And, and there's not been a single uprising of mankind against, against encroachment, by the trustees and by the administrations and all these decades. Okay. Pass them slaves. Slaves. They deserve their slavery.

Speaker 2:          01:57          Yep. I couldn't agree more. I thought the same thing about university professors for a long time is that they get exactly what they deserve because they never stand up and say no. And the fact that in the United States, it's not quite as bad in Canada, I wouldn't say, but the fact that the students have been essentially handed a bill of indentured servitude here for the student loans is absolutely beyond comprehension. You know, it seems to me that the bureaucracy has basically conspired to determine how to pick the pockets of the students' future earnings. Right? And they do that by offering them an extended adolescence with no quality control, something like that. So it's a real bargain with the devil.

Speaker 1:          02:35          And, and I told the abandonment of any kind of education actually in history and culture. All right, everybody got along with it. That is the transformation into a cafeteria kind of a menu. Okay, we can pick this course or that course or this course without any kind of guidance from the university about a central core curriculum that teaches you history and chronology and introduces you to the basics, right? Because what are our professors are prima donnas. They can only teach and their little areas. So we have this total fragmentation and the the, the great art history survey courses are being abandoned steadily because why? Because graduate students are not trained to see the great narratives or the network because we are taught now that narratives are fault.
