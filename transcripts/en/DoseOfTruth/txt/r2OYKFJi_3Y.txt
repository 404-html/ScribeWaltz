Speaker 1:          00:00          There's an old psychoanalytic idea, which is really worthwhile. It's like a surgical tool. And I would say if you're going to use it in your own life, use it carefully because you don't want to do unnecessary surgery. And the rule is, and I think this is union rule, but I can't remember exactly where I read it. If you can't understand why someone is doing something, look at the consequences of their actions, whatever those might be. And then in further motivation from the consequences. So if you see someone who seems to be doing nothing except making everyone around them and themselves miserable and you can't understand why, one of the hypotheses that you might entertain is that they're trying to make everyone around the miserable as well as themselves. And that's actually their goal. And it's hard for people to understand these sorts of things because when we see phenomena like the columbine shooters, you know, we always assume that the reason that these people are doing these sorts of things is for other reasons.

Speaker 1:          00:58          Then the reasons they, that the reasons that appear to motivate them or even the reasons they say they're doing it because the columbine killer, especially the more literate one, he said exactly why he was doing what he was doing. It's not, it's as clear as it could possibly be. All you have to do is go online and read what he said and he tells you what he was up to. But people don't like to think that way because they don't believe that anybody could be consciously possessed of that much malevolence without there being some other kind of cause. Like, you know, he was bullied at school or you know, he was an outcast and those things were only vaguely true and they certainly weren't more true of having them. They were true of, you know, how many people in high school or you know, bullied and somewhat outkast. Jesus, it must be 10%. It's probably more like 30 you know, that doesn't mean that the schools are blowing up all over, you know, all over all the time. It's a completely insufficient explanation.
