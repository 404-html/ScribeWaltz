Speaker 1:          00:06          There are a variety of very complex things facing us, you know, and one of them is while the Iq issue that we talked about, another is this polarization between left and right that seems to be characterizing everywhere in the West. You know, what's the same in Australia, New Zealand, all through Europe, in Canada, in the US. I think you guys are actually a little more protected against the most places. But um, and then the other one is, well we need to dialogue between Islam and Christianity and Judaism for that matter. But I mean the big, the big clash for the Western world is, is Islam versus Christianity. And you know, people don't think about it in those terms because many intellectuals in the west think of themselves as secular, but it's a massive, it's a massive problem. And I'm hoping to conduct a whole series of conversations with, with Muslims, uh, former and present pro and anti to try to facilitate a dialogue because there's lots to talk about.

Speaker 1:          01:08          I mean, I've studied religious thinking a lot and I'm pretty ignorant about Islam because it's a complicated system and it's difficult to get into. But I can tell you that what I've read about Islam has not made me feel better about the chances of reconciliation between the Christian and the Islamic world. So like I don't know what to make of the fact, for example, I mean, if you look at the figure of Christ, and I don't care if you're religious or not, I don't even care if Christ existed or dog, and I certainly don't care at the moment about claims to divinity or the lock there up. It's just speaking as, let's say I'm speaking as a secular intellectual as a figure. He's a figure of peace. I don't think that that's disputable. I mean, he certainly, he wasn't a warlord. That's, that's one thing that's for certain, he never led armies, you know?

Speaker 1:          02:04          Whereas that's not the case with [inaudible] at all. Mohammad was clearly and indisputably a warlord and so it isn't the obvious to me what to make of that except that it's bloody complicated in a child bride as well, I believe. Yeah. Well that that one is somewhat less problematic to me because I think that you can write that off to the cultural morays of the time now. Um, I know that there's a weakness in that, but I don't think we have to address that. But the, when the founder of your religion spread that religion by the sword, it makes it rather difficult. And when your religion has been embroiled in a vicious civil war from the day of Mohammed's death, which is exactly the case in, in Islam, between the Sunni's and the, and the Shiites, that war started literally the day that Mohammed died. It's very difficult for me to see how that can be reconciled with the claims that Islam is a religion of peace.

Speaker 2:          03:05          Yeah. We saw that one when Martin Luther hammered some stuff on a door a long time ago, and the Protestants and the Catholics just went their separate ways. And I mean, like there's been some rough feelings over the years, I suppose, but no generational wars that I can think of. I mean, right.

Speaker 1:          03:22          Yeah. Well, I mean, there was plenty, you know what, as you said there was, there's been plenty of Christian schism. But the other thing too is that it's not that easy to lay those at the feet of Christ. No. Because, because just even merely as an architectural figure, you know, as, as, as, as the western world's hypothesis of the ideal man. I mean, as a moral character, he was pretty much above reproach and I don't, well, it's difficult for me to say the same thing about Mohamad. Now that might be because I'm an ignorant old western white guy, but like I'm doing my best man. I'm a big hit by, or a dow is in for example, and there's great wisdom in Daoism and I've found value, real value in and so much of the religious reading that I did, I've done, but I'm really stumbling with Islam. It's really hard for me to, to see it as other than a primarily political system

Speaker 2:          04:24          and did, and that's how it's being a imply enforced right now with WWE. That's what Isis is all about. You know there were state establish a religious caliphate, you know, across the borders of two two countries. It's, yes, it's less about when I think of religion, yeah. When I think of like the Christian religion, how it's applied here in my home state of Georgia, you know, it's w w when when we go to church and we tied, that has very little to do with politics at all. There's, there's that, there's this huge massive separation between religion, politics for the most part in the u s and could be, there are moments of ambiguity and, and tempers flare over and I'm a monument on this piece of property or no, but that's as stiff as it gets. Like, like the scariest bit of that that I can remember some drunk fellow ran over a monument for the 10 commandments a few months ago and tipped it over. Like, like, like that's what happens when,

Speaker 3:          05:12          and a critical point, like, like if you're not a Christian Kyle and you're, you know, Christian kind of alcove there and Georgia, no one ever is going to come to you and say you have to pay a different rate of taxes. You have to go to different stores, you have to the religious who are, will not be enforced

Speaker 2:          05:28          as a law. You know, I'm not going to lose any hands. I, if I, if I, I, I can, you know, the Bible has many restrictions that it places on Christians and I ignore all of them virtual, you know, like I don't, I know there's no, like there's no,

Speaker 4:          05:43          yeah,

Speaker 2:          05:44          religious police to come and kick my door in and drag me away and torture me and threatened my family and, and well,

Speaker 1:          05:52          it's also, there's other, there's other cataclysms that that are on that exist on the conception in the conceptual realm as well. So, you know, the, the, the states dominated by Islam are not economically productive. And that's quite an interesting mystery and

Speaker 1:          06:14          they're not, and many of the, and many of the Islamic states that we purport to regard as allies hold values that are antithetical to our system. And a Saudi Arabia is a classic example of that. And I cannot for the life of me understand, except in a psychoanalytic manner why the radical feminists tolerate America's Lli. America's lie. The fact that America is allied with the Saudis, it's just absent. It's like, it's like, it's not much different as far as I'm concerned, that it would be if black people didn't say anything. If America was allied with a slave or a black slave owning state, which of course also happens in Saudi Arabia by the way.

Speaker 3:          07:00          So when did the feminist, it's gotta be because Muslims right now are higher up on the victim hierarchy than then. So even if it's way over there, they're not allowed to speak out against sir,

Speaker 1:          07:10          I think it's their unconscious wish for brutal male domination.

Speaker 2:          07:16          I know. I'm, no, I like that. That's fun. I think it's the left's ability to apologize for anything that's wrong. I think that people on the left, maybe I'm just as crazy as you guys are, like the Muslims are oppressed women. Oh, that's cultural. We need to understand that. Oh guys think they're girls. That's, you know, hey, we need to understand where they're coming from. Everything. They're so open minded to egg excuse making, even if it's horrific. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          07:43          That's also the agreeableness say and we were talking about earlier. Yeah. Because agreeable, agreeable people agree. You know, that's, that's why the term exists. And yeah, so there is a real uh, Poland and if you ally that with high openness, which is that open mindedness, you know, that it's associated creativity, you get agreeable openness. Yeah. That's definitely,

Speaker 2:          08:04          and he goes wrong. And I'll forgive you beating your wife often if you're low in conscientiousness, everything you keeping really goes, then bill more puts it nicely when he says, you know, the left would not for one second be okay with apartheid in South Africa. Right. They would just banging that drum hating every second of the way. But for some reason the oppression of women in Saudi Arabia has gotten a complete pass. Yup. And it's a real deal, you know, say it's real deal. Yeah. Heck, just the driving thing alone. Yeah. Taylor, can you hold that? They liked her. Yeah. I broke up. You broke it. We couldn't hear what you were saying. You're still a little frozen. So, um, uh, but yeah, just taking away their ability to drive, right. Women don't have mobility without men. That is hugely oppressive. If you made that change in America and none other than when you're walking stuck at home than you actually don't see

Speaker 1:          09:06          a more concrete embodiment of the idea of individual autonomy than the automobile. You know, I think maybe it was the Soviet Union's import and then, and then, uh, uh, manufacturer. If the automobile, the doom communism, because nothing screams autonomous individual like a car, right? You drive it yourself. You can go on any road. No one tells you what to do. It's like it's freedom. And the fact that women can't drive in Saudi Arabia, it tells the entire story. And so the fact I cannot understand for the life of me why we are so blind in the west, that we make the assumption that those people are our allies. It's like in what

Speaker 2:          09:49          Jay

Speaker 1:          09:50          and things have switched around the lot. I mean, America is now an oil exporting country again, and you guys have been doing pretty good on the fracking for natural gas front. And you know, the other thing that's quite a bit worth considering is that if the west wanted to reduce its reliance on Middle Eastern oil, it can turn to Alberta and the tar sands. There's enough bloody oil there for, for, for the rest of humanity for the rest of time. You know, and it's a bit messy, but it isn't obvious to me that it's better than, it's worse than dumping $1 trillion every five or six years into the coffers of the Saudi princes. Especially given there are obvious responsibility for distributing the most, the most vicious Wahhabis propaganda all over the world with the, which is, which is something that a fair chunk of that petro money goes to.
