Speaker 1:          00:08          Hello Dr Peterson, so I've been listening back to all of these biblical lectures for the second time now and um, I wanted to show you an observation I came upon because I was trying to find a question that you haven't been asked before, which is harder than doing my ryerson exams, that's for sure. So, so I've noticed, I think you're getting funnier. Oh yes. Oh No. I think Michael Koren said that this week I think, but the word he used was bizarre. I think actually I'm feeling better, so that's. I actually have a sense of humor. It's hard to believe that, but. So it sort of comes back when I'm not feeling like I'm going to die at any moment. So I basically noticed one, you're making more attempts a jokes, so that's great.

Speaker 1:          00:58          Okay, thank you. Those jokes are landing more often, but then there's this third element which I think was what Steve Martin quit because of, which is that I think the audience is anticipating jokes more and they're actually, you know, I've noticed people laughing more at things that aren't intending to be jokes. So I was just wondering what you make of that and um, their intended. I'm hoping they're intended. Just because I keep a straight face doesn't mean they're not intended to be jokes. So. Yeah. No, it's good. Look, one of the things is like, it's, and I've tried to keep this, I learned a while ago probably about it five years ago, and even when you're dealing with really serious matters that if you're not handling it with a light touch, you're not an expert at it. You're not a master at it. And you'd think while there are some things that are so deep and dark that you can't handle it with a light touch.

Speaker 1:          01:50          And that's actually not true. You can. That doesn't mean you make light of them. It doesn't mean anything like that. It's that you don't, it's minimal necessary force, something like that. You don't hit it any harder than you have to. And it's a, it's an art when you're discussing serious matters. And so, well, one of the upshots of that is that because we're discussing serious matters and because serious matters are being discussed in the ultra at large right now, it would be really good if everybody could keep their sense of humor, you know, and I see positive signs of that. Like there's a lot of satirical activity on the net, you know, and that could easily categorize into horror mob. But it isn't, it is, it is. That's happening to some degree, but a lot of it's satire and comedy and as long as we can keep a sense of humor about this, then I think, well we're not as close to disaster as we might be.

Speaker 1:          02:42          And so what? One of the things that I have found rather ominous is that there are comedians, first of all, being persecuted for under free speech restriction legislation, which I think is absolutely appalling. But also that there are comedians now who won't perform on university campuses. John won't Seinfeld as like, well, you know how offensive he is. It's no wonder that. I mean he's like the straightest nicest comedian you could possibly imagine. He won't perform on college campuses, I think Louis Ck won't perform or or anywhere else, but it's a bad sign. But no humor. Humors is good and it's interesting because I've been kind of watching how I'm represented on the web weirdly enough and there's all these memes that have emerged, I don't know, thousands of the bloody things and most of them are comical and that's good. Like people are, are, are, they're there, whatever it is that they're doing. I don't know what the hell it is, but it's being done with a relatively light touch and that's really, really good. That's how it should be. You got to have a sense of humor. I mean, it's one of the things that makes life bearable so, or maybe even better than bearable. So.
