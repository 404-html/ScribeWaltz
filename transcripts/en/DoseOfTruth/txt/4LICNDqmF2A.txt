Speaker 1:          00:06          Success breeds success and failure breeds failure. And it's not necessarily linear. And that's a really difficult thing to deal with. And it's hard on societies because one of the things we do know is that, you know, as you stretch out the inequality you make men particularly on the lower end of the distribution, more and more likely to be aggressive. It's sort of like, imagine every man has a threshold for violence. Um, and status is important to men, knocked that it's not important to women, but it's different. It's a different kind of status. It's status is important to men because it's one of the things that makes them marketable as partners to women. So it actually turns out to be quite important to man them. Men tend to compete with one another for status, hierarchy position and in a really unequal society. If you're like a low rung guy then and you don't have any opportunity to rise because the society isn't structured so that there's mobility, then the more aggressive guys tend to turn into criminality and you know, and so you could say there's a threshold for criminality and the more inequality pressure you put on a particular area, geographic or political area, the more inequality pressure you put on it, the more men slip past that threshold and into criminality.

Speaker 1:          01:36          And you know, there's been pretty good studies done of drug gang in Chicago. That was the best one. It's sociologist actually went and hung out with a drug gang for, he got into it, I guess the drug gang leader was, you know, I wouldn't say necessarily narcissistic, but that might be a reasonable way of thinking about it. And he was kind of happy with the idea of maybe being a subject of a book and, and so this guy was able to associate with them, got to know them quite well. And then the housing project in which the gang was housed was slated for demolition. And the gang broke up and he got the books because they kept books. And what he found was the average street drug dealer, first of all was employed in another job as well and was making far less than minimum wage now. But the guy is, you know, further up the chain of course followed the Prieto distribution. And so there was a tiny minority of them who were raking in a tremendous amount of loot. And the guys at the bottom, we're just waiting around for the possibility that they could rise up the hierarchy and you know, it's pretty violent game. So the chances that someone is going to be taken out is pretty high and then a little slot up for some opportunistic second rater and perhaps he can move up the hierarchy.

Speaker 2:          03:09          Okay.

Speaker 1:          03:11          So the burrito distribution governs all sorts of other things too. I mentioned it governs the popularity of box, the sales of books, but it also, it also characterizes the distribution of everything that people produce. So if you think of creative production of any sort of artistic production, industrial production, it doesn't matter. Almost everything fails.

Speaker 2:          03:40          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          03:41          And a few things succeed beyond anyone's wildest imagination. Apple's a good example of that. No, I mean the iPhone, they have their competitors, but it's an extraordinarily dominant product and they rake in billions of dollars, I think. I don't know if apple is valued at $1 trillion, but it's close to that. And that's a lot of money. And I think if I remember correctly, it's something like this, I probably have the figures wrong, but like the top 40 people, the richest 40 people in the world have as much money as the bottom 2 billion right now. You know, it's not like they're stuffing their mattresses with that money or they have a skyscraper full of cash. That money is out in the economy doing whatever money does. So you know, you can't spend $28 billion. So, and sometimes you can even do some good with it. You know, Bill Gates seems to be doing something reasonable with his money. But the reason I'm telling you this is because one of the things you should know is that this proclivity for inequality is pervasive among the creative products of human beings. It's the case with with goals scored in hockey. My son told me, and he's a reliable source on hockey statistics that,

Speaker 2:          05:00          okay,

Speaker 1:          05:00          if Wayne Gretzky, if you don't count any of the points that Wayne Gretzky managed with scoring is still had enough points just with assistance to have more points than any hockey player that ever played. So you know, you even at the upper end of of of the distribution, there's some person who's ha there are so good at what they do and then there's another person that's so much better than them that it's not even comparable. And so, and the benefits flow to people who are in that position. And you can understand why. I would say, because I all, let's say you start writing and you get a book and a rare things, very rare things to have happen. And then some people read it and they like it. And then of course it's much more likely that you'll get a next book. And if people like that, while it's even more likely that you'll get a third book and then people start to know who you are and then because they know who you are, they phone you up on offer you opportunities and your network grows.

Speaker 1:          05:56          And it's like this exponential increase in your reach and your capacity for production and more and more flows to you. And, and then on the other hand, if you start to fail and you know, why would someone fail? Well, God, you know, one idea that's very common in our culture is that poverty is caused by lack of money. And that's a really stupid idea because money is very difficult to handle. I have clients who were drug addicts and the worst possible thing that could happen to them was that they got some money, but they're just done. First of all, you know, they were hanging around with people who were little on the sociopathic side. And so, especially if they weren't that bright and couldn't defend themselves very well, as soon as they got money while it was off to the bar with all the friends and you know, one guy I remember in particular, you know, every time he got his, his disability check, he was gone for five days, usually found him in a ditch.

Speaker 1:          07:03          You know, cause he just go to the bar, spent every sandy had on alcohol and cocaine and wake up in a ditch, three quarters dead, uh, eventually completely dead. And you know, then he was ashamed and horrified and repentant and he'd straightened himself out again. And then that was all well and good until, as long as he was broke until the next check showed up and then bang the same thing. So, you know, it's not like money is necessarily a good for everyone. It's hard manage money. It's really easy for it to disappear. I mean, elderly people have a hell of a time now because you know, crooks are contacting them all on the Internet nonstop. And so just giving people money, money's like, it's like pouring water in their hands is not that helpful. Not necessarily that helpful. And then of course contributors to poverty are, well it's not so good to have a low Iq.

Speaker 1:          08:02          You know, people don't like the idea of Iq because it seems so arbitrary. You know you have a high Iq. Well it's not like you deserve that. Exactly. It's, you set up that way pretty much right from the beginning. It's very, very, very, very stable. You can make a high Iq person stupider by you know, not educating them up to the level of their possibility but taking someone who has a low Iq and trying to raise that. It's like if you can figure out how to do that, well you know it's Nobel prize time for you because people have tried that a lot and most recently with those, you know Luminol Lumosity games and that sort of thing. And the evidence that those produce anything other than brilliant performances on the Lumosity game itself is basically zero. We haven't been able to figure out how to see cause I intelligence a cross domain phenomena and you can get really good in a single domain by practicing like mad and what you'd want is to practice like mad in a single domain and hope that it generalize to other domains. That's the holy grail of intelligence increase. It's like, no, no one's done it. People claim it, but the claims never hold up and people have been trying for a long time to do it and they haven't been able to do it. And

Speaker 1:          09:24          differences in Iq really make a difference. You know, I mean you guys, average Iq is probably one 25 one 30 at one 15 you're at the 85th percentile and one 15 would barely get you going for, for Harvard University one 30 you're probably graduate school and material, you know one 45 you're up there at the range where you can probably do pretty much whatever you want. Although as you get smarter, the scatter between your abilities increase it. So you might have a very high verbal Iq, but not be so good at mathematics or the other way around. But it's a massive contributor to lifetime success. And I don't know what to do about that. I mean, why do smart people make more money? Well, they get to where the edge of production is faster. So if you have a thousand people and you rank order them by Iq, the smart people are going to come up with a new ideas first and they're going to have more ideas and they're going to strategize better. And you know, with an Iq of 90 which is 15% of the population, you think about that 15% of the population. That's pretty much the threshold for reading instructions and being able to follow them.
