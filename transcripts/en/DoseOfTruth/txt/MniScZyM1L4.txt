Speaker 1:          00:09          No on Rio and birthday, who was an existentialist psychotherapist, um, and who was a leader of the existentialist movement in the 1950s and also a profound student of psychoanalysts. Psychoanalysis talked about something he characterized as a creative illness, which was something that manifested itself in Freud and in you and in other people like Viktor Frankl for example, who went through periods of extreme and Darwin, extreme periods of chaotic disruption has their new theories were manifesting themselves because the new theories tore them apart as they were being developed and they paid a tremendous personal price for that. But generally they were able to reorganize themselves within the context of the new theory and that made their stance more powerful and more complete than it was before he described the characteristic elements of the creative illnesses follows. It succeeds a period of intense preoccupation with an idea and search for a certain truth. It's a polymorphous condition that can take the SAPE of depression, neurosis, psychosomatic ailments, or even psychosis, whatever the symptoms they are felt as painful, if not agonizing by the subject with alternating periods of alleviation and worsening it's route. The onus. The subject never loses the thread of his dominating preoccupation. It's often compatible with normal professional activity and family life.

Speaker 2:          01:30          Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:30          But even if he keeps to his social activities, he's almost entirely absorbed with himself. He suffers from feelings of isolation, even when he has a mentor who guides them through the ordeal, like the showman apprentice with his master. The termination is often rapid and marked by a phase of exhilaration. The subject emerges from his ordeal with a permanent transformation in his personality and the conviction that he has discovered a great truth or a new spiritual world also happened to Piaget. Many of the 19th and 20th century figures recognized universally is great nature. Darwin, Dostoevsky, Tolstoy, Freud, young. We're also additionally characterized by lengthy periods of profound psychological unrest and uncertainty. Here's our dream that my daughter had when she was three, and this is quite a cool dream. I caught it. I was able to write it down verbatim because I was writing at the time.

Speaker 1:          02:21          So she came in to tell me this dream. So I typed it out because it's not that easy to catch a kid's dream. So here was the situation. So when we brought her brother home from the hospital, he is two years younger than her. We didn't know, you know, if there's less than a three year gap between siblings, there's a high probability of sibling rivalry because the old siblings still needs a lot of attention. But you know when you have a two year old you think man that's a baby. But when you bring a newborn baby home, that two year olds in adult, like there's such a radical difference between a newborn and a two year old. And so it's hard on the two year old, right? Cause they have to grow up right away and maybe they don't get as much attention. So we taught her to, we taught her to come for a hug when she needed to by practicing that.

Speaker 1:          03:01          And we also prepared her and told her that, you know, there was going to be some trouble but she could get some attention from this new baby. And that was also her baby. So she was all prepared for that. And so she took a lot of care of that baby and she thought it was her baby and she liked this baby. And so she called him baby and then, you know, he started to toddle around and, and uh, and we told her one day, well, he was being toilet trained. We said, look, Mckayla, he's not really a baby anymore. And she didn't like that because she thought, hmm, I like that baby. And now whatever this creature is apparently is not that baby. And so what am I supposed to do about that? And not as a profound question because there are lots of parents who don't let their children progress past the stage of baby because they don't want to lose the baby. And so it's like she was onto something major. So, um,

Speaker 1:          03:53          so this is what she said, this is your dream. Julian is the name of her little brother. Julian's eyes falled out. And then he falled into pieces and I said, what, what sort of pieces? And she said, Julian pieces. It's like, yeah. And then his bones falled out too. Then a whole garden and there was water in it. And when he came out he was big and my wife said, Julian isn't a baby anymore. And mckayla said, no, he's a big boy and above with legs got him out cause bugs can swim and the hole was in the park and the park and it moved into the backyard and he felt he falled in it, a tree burned and left the hole. So that was pretty cool. That's pretty good. Grade three, you know, three year old kid. And so the park, they started, the place was 42 acres and it was like a real forest and park.

Speaker 1:          04:39          And I used to take the kids there like at twilight and you know, we creep around in there and it was pretty scary and exciting for them. So it was sort of an Ick, scary and exciting place. It was full of trees and so it was the unknown outside of our little house. And so her dream said, well the unknown had moved into the backyard in the form of a tree and the tree burned down. And a tree is often a symbol of the psyche. And it left the hall and the hall was full of water and then the little baby went into the water, dissolved and went into the water. And then this weird bug guard them out. So it was some alive thing, bug. It's actually, it was a bug like Jimminy cricket in Pinocchio, You know, cause that's a bug and it's abundant leads transformation by the way. So anyways, the bug got him out and then he was a big boy and what she was dealing with was the nature of radical transformation. How one thing could turn into something different and then reconstitute itself as something else. And she did that on a symbolic level. So what time is it?

Speaker 3:          05:35          Three rats.

Speaker 1:          05:41          All right, well I'll tell you this little story for one minute. So I had a five year old nephew and he was having night terrors, so we'd wake up at night screaming and happened a lot. And uh, there was some trouble in his family at that point. His parents ended up getting divorced, but anyways, he'd wake up screaming and he also was running around during the day with a little night hat on and like a plastic sword. And so he was like, Joe night, you know, and, and then when he went to bed, he had the little night out by him and also the sword. And so one night when I was there, he had one of these night terrors. And so I will, I was there that morning and I said, well, did you dream anything? And this is what he said, dwarf like beat creatures who came up to his knees, had he was out in the field and they were like, so these little things about this big, they had no arms, they just had a big head that was beaky a beak and they were jumping at him with the beak and like chomping him.

Speaker 1:          06:30          And on the top of their head they, it was all hairy and greasy and on the top of their head they had a cross shaved in it. So it was like everybody shut up at that breakfast. I can tell us like, oh, that's what's happening. It's no, no wonder you're screaming. And then so he is fighting away with these things and they're jumping on him. But the problem was I said, he said he, there was a dragon in the background and what was happening was the dragon was breathing out fire all the time and the fire and the smoke, we're turning into these boring, you know, little dwarf bird things that were biting him. And it's like perfect, right? It's such a perfect representation. He can't fight off any one problem cause it's sort of pointless because there's something in the background generating problems like mad.

Speaker 1:          07:11          It's like a hydra cut off one head, seven more grow. So I said, what could you do about that? Which is a leading question, right? Because it implies that he could do something about that. So then he said, I would take my dad and we would go after the dragon. I jumped on his head and poke his eyes out with my sword and then I go down its belly to where the fire comes out. And I'd carve out a piece of the firebox and I'd make a shield out of it. And I thought, yes, that's right. Yeah. So, and one of the things that's very interesting, and I know this is hard to believe, but it's absolutely true. He did not have any night terrors after that was extra cool. And it was the leading question. It's cause he's like victim, right? It's like, oh my God, horrible bird headed biting things, you know, which is pretty good. It's like that's what the world's like. And then there's something in the background generating these things. What do you do? You go to the source of the trouble and you find something that shields yourself from it in the encounter. Brilliant. All right.
