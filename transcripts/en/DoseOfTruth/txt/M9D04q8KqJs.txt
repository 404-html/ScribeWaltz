Speaker 1:          00:01          Lots of times when, when I'd been treating people for depression, for example, or anxiety, they have existential issues. You know what, it's not just some psychiatric condition. It's not just the third tapped off of normal because their brain chemistry is faulty. Although, you know, sometimes that happens to be the case. It's that they are overwhelmed by the suffering and complexity of their life and they're not sure why it's reasonable to continue with it.

And it's not a good thing. It's not a good thing and it's, it's really not a good thing because it manifests itself not only an individual psychopathology but also in social psychopathology. And that's his proclivity of people to get tangled up in etiology.
