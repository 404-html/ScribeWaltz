Speaker 1:          00:07          I read some, a dissertation about how male feminists think about themselves and how they go about having sex. For example, every one of the men said that he's, he's way to approach sex was that he didn't take any initiative because he would, he would foul, uh, the, the file, the, the whole situation and the woman.

Speaker 2:          00:27          Yeah. Well, it's like Andrea to work in a back in the 70s that horrible. She's a horrible creature. Andrea at the work. And, uh, you know, she said that it's men engaged in sexual behavior with an erect penis. That that was, ah, that, that was equivalent to violence. Right. That was equivalent to rate. Yeah. So, I mean, I don't even know what to say about that, except that that's exactly what Andrea to work and was like. And she was a real heroine to the radical feminists, you know, Harun where someone else around that period of time, dude, Catherine Mckinnon, I think her name was equally, equally

Speaker 1:          01:07          well, I think a red book.

Speaker 2:          01:11          Yeah. Well, you would've, you would've. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, from my perspective as a clinician, those people have clear every indication of serious personality disorders. And I actually think to some degree that we've made a haven for people who have serious personality pathology in these, in these pseudo disciplines, in the universities. And you know, you said something interesting you said that, uh, you know, when you went to, to when you took your sociology degree, that these were basically fringe views. Now their center views in the university, but also implying that they're increasingly dominant views in society. And that's the thing is that people think that these are somehow ivory tower arguments. But what happens in the university's happens in society five to 10 years later. And so, and that's exactly what's happening right now. So

Speaker 1:          02:04          I think these, these leads us into the me to a debate because will you have people in Sweden right now? I think the, me too phenomenon is much larger in Sweden than in any other country. I mean, it's, it's dominated the media for one month now. And, uh, every profession has, uh, uh, uh, has an mi to a sort of article with thousands of women, uh, signing on to it. So the teachers and the lawyers and the doctors. So what one thing is interesting about this is how the men are handling it because

Speaker 1:          02:50          um, there are a lot of men writing that I as a man, uh, have a responsibility for this happening. I a man as a male, I'm responsible and I'm guilty and actually it was one. So there are a lot of articles like that. And then one of them, one of the men that was accused of doing something inappropriate, it was the former leader for the left Radical Party. And if the thing he had done was, was not so reprehensible, he had approached a woman and then she had said no and he had apologized, but then she didn't accept that. Then now he's under investigation police investigation and we have this sort of witch hunt

Speaker 2:          03:36          is that almost all, all manifestations of male sexuality are going to be brought under legal control. And he actually wrote

Speaker 1:          03:45          the article that said, yes, I am responsible because I say I'm responsible. I'm better than the majority of men's reactions to this. So actually he turned the thing that he was being under investigation into because he showed that because he admitted he showed that he was better.

Speaker 2:          04:02          Yup. So, so it's very our stay, I mean the whole idea was that you were supposed to come to terms with your class guilt and then confess and then, and then indicate that you could be brought back into the etiological fold properly. The thing is, it's a lot of muddy thinking. It's like, well man should take responsibility for their aggressive sexuality and they should incorporate it. Right. Because if you repress it, it just comes out in the most ugly way. So I mean, part of the ideas that men, boys should be socialized like little girls, you know? But that's complete rubbish. In fact, even little girls perhaps shouldn't be socialized like little curls, but whatever. I mean that's beside the point that that aggressive capacity that's associated with sexuality as well as Freud pointed out so long ago, needs to be integrated within the personality so that it's under control, right?

Speaker 2:          04:52          And then it's, it's the hint of darkness and it's the capacity for malevolence, but it's, but it's brought under, but it's brought under civilized regulation. And so then you get to have your cake and eat it too, right? You can be strong and potentially dangerous and mysterious and all of those things that, that are definitely attractive. That's an attractive features of men, not only to women, but also to other men. So you have to take responsibility for that. But that doesn't mean that you should identify yourself as the member of a guilty group because of a class based accusation. Right. That's just, you're not guilty as the member of a class. I mean, that's part of the reason that I've been pushing so hard against these postmodern, neo Marxist ideas because one of their essential predicates is that you can be guilty as the member of a class. And that is, I don't know if there's a more dangerous idea then, then that there might be, because you know, there's a very large number of extremely dangerous ideas, but that one's, that one's up near the top. Yeah. It's happening to great degree in the United States to lesser so in Canada, but every day there's another slew of, of influential man who are being outed for their past sexual misbehavior and, you know, and that, and, and that's, that's, uh, I don't have much to say about that except that to use that as evidence for the

Speaker 2:          06:24          group-based guilt of men as such. Yeah. Well, whatever, whatever, I'm going to get a hell of a lot worse before it gets better, I'm afraid.
