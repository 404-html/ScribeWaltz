Speaker 1:          00:06          So, same thing here, they're selling, you know, ha, he's the great father of the family and these, these kids are, they're kind of like the Soviet equivalent of cub scouts. They're sort of worship a game. And then I really liked the other one on the, on the right, because I mean, you could hardly find a more hellish representation of a tyrant than that. Right? I mean, it looks, and this is quite interesting, it looks like Stellan is standing in front of a man. Door lock is Amanda Orla is a shape like this and all shape. You see that in renaissance art all the time. It's an extremely old symbol. It's the oldest symbol that people have ever found evidence for. And the thing is on fire. It's like Stella, there he is, King of Hell. And it's exactly right. You know, it's, it's, it's eerie that that's the mode of representation that emerged for them, but it's certainly accurate.

Speaker 1:          00:59          So, you know, the whole tyrannical end of the great father is, this is the sort of thing that results from it, you know, it's like the, the, uh, elevation of the person at the top of the dominance hierarchy to the status of some kind of quasi identity certainly happened in Hitler's case. And then the brutal murderousness that can emerge from that, those are pictures from the concentration camps at the end of World War Two. So, you know, so I told you that the feminine can be rep that terrible unknown things can be represented by the feminine, sort of a monstrous figure, you know, but it's certainly the case that the monstrosity of culture is roughly equivalent to the monstrosity of nature. You know, and one of the things you might think about is that common India tend to utilize these symbolic categories. It's almost as if they appropriate them.

Speaker 1:          01:49          So the environmental movement, for example, basically says benevolent nature, right? So that's the positive feminine negative culture because that's cultures out there, rapaciously destroying the pristine wilderness of Mother Nature and the negative individual too. Because you know, human beings are part of that as individuals and we're kind of a cancer on the face of the planet, if you know, I mean that's pretty dark way of looking at it obviously, but it's one sided because you could easily say, yeah, well, you know, we're in a war with nature because obviously she's trying to kill us as fast as possible and we better have some culture because otherwise we'd be sitting outside in the freezing snow and you know, you might be a re patients consumer, but on the other hand you're just trying to survive and it's not that easy. And so, you know, you need to have both of those stories together before you have a reasonable representation of the world.

Speaker 1:          02:38          It's not easy to cope with something like, well like that. It's not easy to cope with something like that in every institution has this potential and this element because institutions tend towards bureaucratization and tyranny as they develop. They close up and become rigid. And so, you know, that's a rough thing to deal with. And then of course is a rough thing to deal with too. So you might think, well, you could have a little bit of sympathy for human beings, not just throw them in the horrible rapacious creature category, which I think is an extraordinarily pathological and also a pre genocidal thing to do, you know, because you hear environment to lists for example now, and then say the planet would be better off without people on. It's like, well, you know, that's Kinda what Hitler thought as well about certain kinds of people anyways. And God only knows where he would have stopped. So you know, when someone says something like that, one of the things you might think is you should take a good look at your unconscious structure there Bucko, because fundamentally you're, you know, there is a genocidal ideology at the bottom of your thoughts structure. And you know, you might think that you're an environmentalist but you're actually possessed by a genocidal etiology and you better do something about that. Because if you ever get any power, you're going to be one dangerous creature.
