Speaker 1:          00:06          And then what seems to go along with that is something like truth in conception and action. You know, even people like Jacob who are pretty damn morally ambivalent to begin with, get hammered a lot by what they go through. And what seems to happen is that they're hammered into some sort of ethical shape, right? So by the mid point of their life's journey, there are people who are solidly planted who you can trust and who don't betray being or themselves or their fellow Matt. And so it's an interesting, I mean it seems reasonable to me to first assume that you have to establish a relationship with something that's transcendent. It might even be just the future version of you. And then second that you have to align yourself with reality in a truthful manner. And that that's your best bet. And the biblical stories are actually quite realistic about that too, because they don't really say that if you do that, you're going to be instantly transported to the promised land. Like even Moses, as we'll find out in the accident, his stories, he never makes it to the promised land. And so it's not like you're offered instantaneous, final redemption. If you move out forthrightly into the world, establish a faithful relationship with being and attempt to conduct yourself with integrity, but it's your best bet and it might be good enough. And even if it's not good enough, it's really preferable to the alternative, which seems to be something closely akin to hell, both personal and social.
