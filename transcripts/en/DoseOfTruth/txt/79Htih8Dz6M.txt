Speaker 1:          00:06          So you might say, well, what happens when you, when you feel one way and you say something else, I mean you're all in, you're all perfectly,

Speaker 1:          00:16          it's the middle year with that experience. In fact, my experience with people has been that, and this is another issue with instrumental use of language. You know, you say, well what are you using your language for? Well, have to get what you want, but that can be consciously manipulated. Then maybe we'll say, well that's what the psychopath is like except the psychopath is not only consciously manipulative, he's also unconsciously manipulative because he's been practicing it for like three decades. So all the little machines in his head or deceptive too, and they run on automatic. So he'll just lie just to see if he can pull one over on you because that demonstrates that not only is he smarter than you, but that you deserve to be victimized because you're such an idiot. So, but people use instrumental language like that. Not only consciously to get what they want, but you know, it's something that we definitely think of is characteristic for example of teenagers. Right? I mean, there isn't a teen movie that's be made in the last 50 years. I don't think. It doesn't deal with the negative consequences of using instrumental language. Right. Basically the team has put in some position where they're being pulled, pulled by maybe various social forces, different friendship groups or, or there's a,

Speaker 2:          01:27          um, but there was a

Speaker 1:          01:31          contradictory relationship between what their friends want and their parents want or what their friends want and there's school wants or what they want and their friends want or what the school wants. So all of these things are pulling and pushing in different directions and the directions are essentially in some, in some sense the directions or moral because they're all about what to do. And the, the plot of the movie is how the teenager, it's usually a Rogerian plot. It's usually about how the teenager comes to more to fuller self realization. Right. And that they're able to, that they're able to stave off the, the temptations that are posed sometimes by the authorities, so they don't become too obedient and sometimes by their peers so that they don't become only a reflection of peer pressure.

Speaker 2:          02:17          Question. I was just going to say, wouldn't care. Absolutely. Peer pressure, peer peer pressure is absolutely that.

Speaker 1:          02:29          And so if you're using language to fit in, well that's also instrumental use of language and for, and for Rogers, that would be one of the sources of pathology. Now it's very much worth taking this seriously. So

Speaker 1:          02:47          here's an example that I thought about a lot. What do you do if you're at work and someone tells you to do something that you don't want to do? And I don't mean that, forget, assume you're disciplined, you know, assume that you're not just lazy and worthless. And that's why you don't want to do it. And you want to ask yourself that first, right? Because maybe you're just being lazy and worthless and you should pull yourself together and do the thing you know. So, but failing that, let's say that you're being asked to do something that you're finding, you're having a very difficult time to get motivated to do. So that'd be one clue. And that it's also making you uneasy. So you're waking up in the middle of the night and you're being anxious and it's running through your mind. And what should you do?

Speaker 2:          03:34          Well, it's your job.

Speaker 1:          03:39          Someone who is in the hierarchy above you is telling you to do it. Maybe you should just do it. Well then you might ask yourself, well, why can't you just go ahead and do it? You know, you might say, well, maybe it's because I criminal and you're afraid of getting caught, but let's forget about that for a minute. Let's assume that the probability, maybe it's a low level moral transgression, it's not precisely illegal. And even so the probability that you're going to get caught is very low. Why would it bother you and should you take that seriously? Now Rogers would claim that the reason it would bother you is because it would make the structure of yourself system inconsistent.

Speaker 2:          04:23          So

Speaker 1:          04:26          imagine you're trying to organize a group of people to do some tasks. You know, like maybe they were in a row and you have to fill it in a hole in the road. And so you have to put people in a row and you've, you handed rocks down the line. You know, if you got one person in there who is trying to put rocks, make the rocks go the other way or dropping them or something like that, well then obviously the entire structure is not going to function properly. And it's because there's an internally to consistency in 10 you know, it's a fundamental presupposition of, of, of logic. It's maybe the most fundamental principle of communication that a thing can't be itself and something else at the same time. That's the principle of noncontradiction. Right. And so the hypothesis here would be that you have to follow the principle of noncontradiction with regards to the organization of your own self.

Speaker 1:          05:17          The self would be, Roger's thinks about that as an are a differentiated field, subfield of the phenomenal field. Right? So you're always experiencing things and part of what you've experienced is that you at the center of that and that's the self as far as Roger's is concerned. And the proposition would be you have to organize the self in a non contradictory manner or well or what well or you feel negative emotion. Now he would think about that as anxiety general. Yes we can start the narrative around, well that might work. You know, I mean that's a very good and complicated question because what you're asking is, well why, why can't you rationalize effectively? That's really, well

Speaker 1:          06:18          that's a postmodern theory I would say in some sense because the postmodern like to claim that there's nothing outside of the text. Right? And then things in some sense are infinitely malleable and that the malleability comes as a consequence of the different narratives that you like might weave. But Rogers would point out that, well the first thing he pointed out is that stupid, which it is. I mean there's all sorts of things that are characteristics of your characteristic, of your experience that haven't gone. Pets like phenomenology, you know, like I think it's very, very difficult to claim that pain is, is textual, you know? And we do know that you can,

Speaker 1:          07:01          you can manipulate the way an organism feels pain quite extensively. So, for example, if you whack the dog on the nose with a newspaper, every time it goes to eat, it will starve to death. You can teach it not to eat very rapidly. And so what you're doing is you're teaching the dog that hunger is punishing and then it transforms hunger into anxiety and then it go heat. So the reason I'm telling you that is because even something as fundamental as hunger, which you might think about as a basic phenomenon, can be modulated by learning, but there are limits to that. There evident limits to that. Now, I think the problem with weaving a narrative is that even if it's complex and sophisticated, and so you've convinced yourself, that doesn't necessarily mean that the actions and perceptions undertaken as a consequence of that formulation are going to be commensurate with the rest of your personality.

Speaker 1:          07:51          It's a big risk, you know? So and I think it is the risk that people run when they tell themselves or act out at the false owed. No, because for Rogers, you could also act out false hoods. Right? In fact, the philosophers call that a performative contradiction. That's when you say one thing and do another, it's a form of lie, but it's an embodied line. Rogers was, he was a very, he was very cognizant of embodiment as a, as a central human feature. So, you know, he was very concerned about the fact that the representational structures had to take into account the realities of the underlying biology and those. So those would be felt states in a sense. So I think the Rogerian answers, you can't get away with it that easily. What that'll do is it'll produce contradictions as you move forward. And those contradictions will, will unsettle you either in a minor way or in a deep way.

Speaker 1:          08:47          Now, as far as I can tell by Rogers, never really formalized a theory about why something is deep and why something was shallow in terms of it's misrepresentation. But we've already talked about that. If you think about the hierarchical structure that I showed you many times, the idea there is that higher level of the abstraction that you mess around with, the more of your personality you pathologize. And I, I've been thinking this week too that, that that hierarchy, you know, the one I showed you many times, I believe I have any ways little eggs in rows. I think that's the structure of the unconscious actually. So, and you miss about without at your peril because you're programming your own perceptions and your actions. And so the Rogerian presupposition, and this is why I'm talking about the presuppositions that underlied is thinking because the Rogerian approach is based on a deep presupposition, which is that honest integration matters.

Speaker 1:          09:48          Now you could say, well, perhaps not. It's like, well, that's been the question that people have been debating since the beginning of time. But my experience as a therapist, just so you know, I've never seen anyone get away with anything. I think every time you do something that you know isn't right, you're going to get wall up for it. Sooner or later. Now you may be, may have blinded yourself so badly because of your ms apprehensions and deceptions that you can't see the causal connection between what you did and the punishment. In fact, sometimes it takes years of psychotherapeutic investigation to, to lay out the causal narrative, you know? But why, why would anybody ever think they can bend the structure of reality and get away with it? You know? To me it's like, you know those plastic rulers, it's like you can hold one of those in front of your nose and bend it forward and that's fine. But as soon as you let go, it's going to hit you in the face. And so, you know, then you're going to curse, faced fake because you got hit in the face, but you've been the down ruler.
