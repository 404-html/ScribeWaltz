Speaker 1:          00:00          Right. Hello Dr. I am a 23 year old male with paranoid schizophrenia. However, I feel like controlling 95 percent of it. Okay, so let's say I think you mean that you're controlling 95 percent of it. I desire to seek a partner, but I am afraid how to reveal it. Any advice on how to approach it? Oh God. Steven, that's a really hard question. Well, look, you're not under any obligation when you first meet someone to drown them in information about your identity. So I would say the devil's in the details. Fundamentally, if you have a relationship with someone and it's progressing and you're being honest, my suspicions are that it will come up with its own accord. You know, that you'll be able to tell in the situation when the right way to introduce it is, um, you know, if, if you're asking me this because you've been in a relationship for a long time and you haven't revealed it, then I don't know what to tell you about that because an [inaudible] I wouldn't give someone general advice about that. You know, if, uh,

Speaker 1:          01:18          sorry if I, if are we speaking to a client and I had some real detailed information about their current situation, I would sit down and help them strategize about that. Ask about the person you're telling. Figure out how long you've gone out with them, figure out a way that it might be revealed that you would be comfortable with. I suspect probably what you should do is find someone you trust to talk about it. If you're already in a relationship, and if you're not, then assume that if going into the relationship, your basic goal is honesty. That you'll handle it appropriately. When the situation comes up.
