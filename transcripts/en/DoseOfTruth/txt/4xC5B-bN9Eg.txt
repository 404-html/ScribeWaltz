Speaker 1:          00:06          Okay, so this is the individual instead. So we have explored territory, unexplored territory or the known and the unknown or order and chaos. And then we have the thing that mediates between them. And that's the individual. And this is of medieval representation, which I really love. You know, there's the dome of the sky there. It's a very archaic idea that the earth is a dome because it kind of looks like that if you go out in a flat field, you know, if you're out in the ocean, the way the world looks like a dome on a disk. And so that's sort of the representation here. It's a very ancient idea. And this guy at the bottom left of the pictures poking his head through the comprehensible world and looking at the chaos beyond. And so he's a heroic figure. So the knower is the individual is always the hero of his story, right?

Speaker 1:          00:54          The protagonist of a story. Now it can be an antihero too because just like the known has a negative element and a pause development and the unknown has a negative element and a positive element. The individual has a negative element and a positive element. And so there's the hero and the adversary roughly speaking. And you know, there's all sorts of movies where the protagonist is an Antihero, you know, and those movies are usually there to show you bad examples in some sense. Or you get mixed characters like Batman and he's tangled up with the joker. And as the joker points out in that brilliant performance, they're mirror images of one another. And so the jokers and adversary, it's, it's, it's more complicated than that. But so some of the symbols that commonly represent the individual in symbolic representations are while, and also conceptual representations are ego consciousness. The trickster bugs bunny is a good example of a trickster, the fool, the hero, the coward spirit as opposed to matter or as opposed to dogma, the son, the son of the unknown, and the son of the king. So, and those are very, very common figures. And I'll walk you through some of that as we progress today. So, and then there's the figure of the adversary. So you see on the right hand, left hand side there, you see.
