1
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:08,490
I am a web software developer.

2
00:00:08,491 --> 00:00:09,350
Are you hiring your,

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:10,590
can I volunteer for anything?

4
00:00:10,591 --> 00:00:11,610
I could build anything.

5
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:12,810
I can automate things.

6
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:14,940
I could simply be an assistant of sorts.

7
00:00:14,941 --> 00:00:16,050
Thank you for your time.

8
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:16,801
Well,

9
00:00:16,801 --> 00:00:18,870
what I would like to
say about that is first,

10
00:00:18,871 --> 00:00:19,820
thank you Adam.

11
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:24,890
It's much appreciated and a lot of people
have volunteered their time to me and

12
00:00:25,441 --> 00:00:26,630
their and their,

13
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:27,480
um,

14
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:29,100
technological expertise.

15
00:00:29,101 --> 00:00:31,860
And as much as I'd like to make use of it,

16
00:00:31,861 --> 00:00:36,861
that simple truth of the matter is that
I'm sufficiently overwhelmed by the

17
00:00:36,901 --> 00:00:38,700
complexity of my life at the moment,

18
00:00:38,701 --> 00:00:42,360
that it's very difficult to undertake a
new collaborative project with anyone.

19
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:43,290
I mean,

20
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:44,460
generally speaking,

21
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:46,560
before all this political,

22
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:48,953
um,

23
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:54,150
what would you call it before all these
political events overtook my life.

24
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:57,780
I was already scheduled probably
about six months to a year out.

25
00:00:57,781 --> 00:00:58,350
You know,

26
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:00,000
all my time was already eaten up.

27
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,230
And of course the addition of everything
that's happened in the last year or two

28
00:01:04,231 --> 00:01:08,640
that has occupied my time
to a degree that is was,

29
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:11,370
is really somewhat unimaginable.

30
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:16,320
And so I just can't
take on additional help,

31
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:20,340
which is so strange because you'd think
that help is help and that it would save

32
00:01:20,341 --> 00:01:20,611
time.

33
00:01:20,611 --> 00:01:20,971
But you know,

34
00:01:20,971 --> 00:01:25,170
it's very difficult to
enter into a collaborative
relationship with someone and

35
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,080
especially if you want to give
them credit and do things properly.

36
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:29,273
So,

37
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:30,780
um,

38
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:35,640
at the moment I'm afraid that I can't
entertain any such offers even though I'd

39
00:01:35,641 --> 00:01:36,091
like to,

40
00:01:36,091 --> 00:01:37,680
and there may come a time in the future,

41
00:01:37,681 --> 00:01:41,910
especially when I'm hopefully starting
to work more on this online university

42
00:01:41,911 --> 00:01:42,744
project.

43
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:43,620
Um,

44
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:47,340
I've got a few projects to finish up
before that to the new personality task,

45
00:01:47,341 --> 00:01:49,380
which we've just about got
all the bugs worked out of.

46
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:54,240
And also the high school version of
the future authoring program are all,

47
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:56,520
we're all set up long
before any of this happened,

48
00:01:56,521 --> 00:02:00,330
so I have to clear them out before I
can concentrate on a new project that I

49
00:02:00,331 --> 00:02:05,331
finished a book over the last couple
of years to called a 12 rules for life,

50
00:02:05,431 --> 00:02:07,050
an antidote to chaos,

51
00:02:07,051 --> 00:02:08,730
which is now available by the way,

52
00:02:08,731 --> 00:02:11,640
if you're interested
on Amazon for preorder.

53
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:12,833
Um,

54
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:14,910
and so anyways,

55
00:02:14,911 --> 00:02:17,820
this is my roundabout way of
saying thank you very much,

56
00:02:17,821 --> 00:02:22,821
but I can't accept more help at the moment
because my time is too restricted to

57
00:02:23,911 --> 00:02:25,020
make proper use of it.

58
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:25,350
So.
