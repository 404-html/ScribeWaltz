1
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:10,250
Would it hurt to define of what a
religious experiences in this case then?

2
00:00:10,251 --> 00:00:12,330
Because I feel like the semantics of like,

3
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:15,710
I'm not sure if what you're saying
about a religious experience is what I'm

4
00:00:15,711 --> 00:00:16,580
understanding.

5
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:17,851
Well,

6
00:00:17,851 --> 00:00:22,560
generally a religious experience is
something like an experience of the,

7
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:24,300
of the renewal of the world.

8
00:00:24,301 --> 00:00:25,430
That might be one way of,

9
00:00:25,431 --> 00:00:30,120
of thinking about it so that everything's
sort of leaps forward as crystal clean

10
00:00:30,121 --> 00:00:34,980
and perfect as if you had been viewing
it from behind the mask before.

11
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:39,060
Another would be a sense
of the Union of everything.

12
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:43,950
And so you're a singular being and you're
isolated and in religious experiences.

13
00:00:43,951 --> 00:00:44,641
So for example,

14
00:00:44,641 --> 00:00:47,520
there's a book written
recently by a neuroscientist,

15
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:48,720
uh,

16
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:49,950
my stroke of,

17
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:52,523
what's it called?

18
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:54,720
My stroke of insight.

19
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:54,961
Yeah,

20
00:00:54,961 --> 00:00:55,471
that's right.

21
00:00:55,471 --> 00:00:58,920
And I believe she had a
left hemisphere stroke,

22
00:00:58,921 --> 00:01:00,180
if I remember correctly.

23
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:01,920
And she was

24
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:07,800
sufficiently well developed
neuroscientists to understand
what was happening as

25
00:01:07,801 --> 00:01:08,820
she had the stroke.

26
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:09,900
And,

27
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:14,700
and she had a intense religious
experience as a consequence of that.

28
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:20,060
And she experienced it as a dissolution
of the ego into this state of union with

29
00:01:20,311 --> 00:01:20,911
everything.

30
00:01:20,911 --> 00:01:25,230
And this transcendent
experience of awe and and the,

31
00:01:25,231 --> 00:01:27,510
oh well I don't remember the rest of it.

32
00:01:27,511 --> 00:01:30,570
I mean there are other elements
of religious experience
that are quite common.

33
00:01:30,571 --> 00:01:32,400
The idea of the opening of the heavens,

34
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:33,443
that's one.

35
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:35,250
The communion with the ancestors,

36
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,000
that's another the reduction
of the body to a skeleton,

37
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:42,670
that's another the movement
up into heaven there.

38
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:46,440
These are well documented phenomena
and a lot of them are associated.

39
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:49,890
While a fair number of them are
associated with psychedelic use,

40
00:01:49,891 --> 00:01:54,540
but that's not the only
avenue to experiences like
that and epilepsy can produce

41
00:01:54,541 --> 00:01:59,160
experiences like that too and people
usually report near death experiences as

42
00:01:59,161 --> 00:01:59,560
well.

43
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,091
And you know,

44
00:02:00,091 --> 00:02:04,890
people usually report that
those experiences have
life altering significance.

45
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:10,250
Now that in and of itself only proves
that people are capable of having

46
00:02:10,531 --> 00:02:12,420
subjective religious experiences.

47
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:13,343
Right.

48
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:17,700
It doesn't definitively proved that
there's anything outside of that.

49
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,740
So Young Carl Young for example,

50
00:02:19,741 --> 00:02:22,140
most of the time he didn't talk about God.

51
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:24,510
He talked about the God image,

52
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:28,650
which is not the same thing because you
could have a god image that was even

53
00:02:28,651 --> 00:02:33,651
evolutionarily instantiated without that
necessarily being rep related to any

54
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:37,440
transcendent being beyond the image.

55
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:38,303
Right?

56
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:40,560
So who knows,

57
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:41,513
who knows?

58
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:42,773
Um,

59
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:43,261
again,

60
00:02:43,261 --> 00:02:47,370
I think it depends on what you're
willing to accept as proof.

61
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:48,630
Now the proof,

62
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:51,870
the it's beyond question that could,

63
00:02:51,871 --> 00:02:54,720
people can have life changing
religious experiences.

64
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:59,440
Another example of that is that the best
treatment for alcoholism is religious

65
00:02:59,441 --> 00:03:00,274
conversion.

66
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:04,210
It's well documented in the literature
and I studied alcoholism for a long time.

67
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:09,450
So one of the cures that
sticks is religious conversion
and the 12 step programs

68
00:03:10,451 --> 00:03:13,180
essentially attempt to
instantiate religious conversion.

69
00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:18,570
And it's hard to document their success
because they succeed for the people who

70
00:03:18,641 --> 00:03:19,510
stick with it.

71
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:21,880
But that's not a very good measure.

72
00:03:21,881 --> 00:03:22,121
Right?

73
00:03:22,121 --> 00:03:22,954
It's sort of,

74
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:27,220
it's sort of self evident that they
work for the people who stick with it.

75
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:30,760
I'm not cynical about about
alcoholics anonymous or anything,

76
00:03:30,761 --> 00:03:32,200
but we don't have good data on,

77
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:33,070
on outcome.

78
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:38,730
But there is good data
showing that religious
transformation is a good cure for

79
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:39,873
alcoholism.

80
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:41,140
So,

81
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:44,030
and that's an interesting phenomena to um,

82
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:50,470
it's too complicated.

83
00:03:50,471 --> 00:03:51,304
They're probably can't.

84
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:54,601
Okay,

85
00:03:54,601 --> 00:03:54,961
I'll try.

86
00:03:54,961 --> 00:03:56,220
I'll try this for a second.

87
00:03:56,221 --> 00:03:58,710
So here's how I think a
religious conversion might work.

88
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:01,680
So imagine you've got the
left hemisphere and it's,

89
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:04,770
it's the place where your
habitual interpretations reside.

90
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:08,550
So I can give you a quick example of this.

91
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:11,260
So this Guy Arama Shawn Ryan,

92
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:13,760
who's a neuro physiologist or a,

93
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,633
I think that's his,

94
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:15,900
that's his field of study.

95
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:17,670
I think he's at Ucla.

96
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:20,160
He studied people who had neglect.

97
00:04:20,210 --> 00:04:22,200
And neglect is a very,

98
00:04:22,201 --> 00:04:23,310
very bizarre phenomenon.

99
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:26,640
So if you have a stroke that
damages your right parietal lobe,

100
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:29,820
you'll lose the left part of your being,

101
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:31,080
not just your body.

102
00:04:31,081 --> 00:04:32,040
It's really weird.

103
00:04:32,041 --> 00:04:32,580
It's like,

104
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:33,361
so for example,

105
00:04:33,361 --> 00:04:37,590
if you have a right parietal
stroke and you look at a clock,

106
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,420
you only see you only,

107
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:41,460
only half the clock exists for you.

108
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:43,830
It's not like you only see half the clock.

109
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:44,820
It's weirder than that.

110
00:04:44,821 --> 00:04:47,910
It's that there's only the
right side of the clock.

111
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:49,560
There's only the right side of you.

112
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:51,480
There's only the right side of my body.

113
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:53,610
I don't know that this exists.

114
00:04:53,611 --> 00:04:56,340
And so sometimes people
with right parietal damage,

115
00:04:56,341 --> 00:04:56,620
we'll,

116
00:04:56,620 --> 00:05:00,900
we'll wake up after the stroke and
grabbed their left arm and throw it out of

117
00:05:00,901 --> 00:05:04,200
bed and or their leg and throw it
out of bed because it's not theirs.

118
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:05,820
And then of course they fall out of bed,

119
00:05:05,821 --> 00:05:06,990
which is quite a shock to them.

120
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:09,390
So and so,

121
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:11,820
and they'll only eat half
the food on the plate.

122
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,520
Nobody can really understand
this phenomenal logically,

123
00:05:14,521 --> 00:05:14,761
right?

124
00:05:14,761 --> 00:05:17,280
Because we can't Magine
what that must be like.

125
00:05:17,281 --> 00:05:18,420
I think it must be like,

126
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:21,390
you know how you know
there's things behind you,

127
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:23,610
but you don't not see them.

128
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:24,870
They're just not there.

129
00:05:24,871 --> 00:05:26,520
It's not like it's black or anything,

130
00:05:26,521 --> 00:05:27,540
or there's a space,

131
00:05:27,541 --> 00:05:29,340
it's just not there.

132
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:34,620
And so I think what happens is the not
there extends to three quarters of the

133
00:05:34,621 --> 00:05:36,270
field instead of half the field.

134
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:37,860
That's a guess.

135
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:38,401
Anyway,

136
00:05:38,401 --> 00:05:40,110
so Ramesh,

137
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:40,411
now,

138
00:05:40,411 --> 00:05:43,650
the funny thing about people with
neglect is that if you tell them,

139
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:44,910
if you point it out,

140
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:45,361
you say,

141
00:05:45,361 --> 00:05:45,571
well,

142
00:05:45,571 --> 00:05:48,540
I noticed that you're not
moving your left foot today.

143
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:49,291
They'll say,

144
00:05:49,291 --> 00:05:49,740
well,

145
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:50,280
it's,

146
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,150
it's arthritic.

147
00:05:51,151 --> 00:05:53,160
And I can't move it and say,

148
00:05:53,161 --> 00:05:53,311
well,

149
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:54,270
why don't you just try to move it?

150
00:05:54,271 --> 00:05:54,541
So no,

151
00:05:54,541 --> 00:05:54,811
look,

152
00:05:54,811 --> 00:05:58,220
doctor already told you it's in too
much pain to move it working fine this

153
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:01,220
morning and that can be
months after the the accident.

154
00:06:01,221 --> 00:06:06,221
So it's a denial and people
thought actually that that
was trauma induced denial

155
00:06:06,261 --> 00:06:09,020
for a long time before they figured it
out was actually a consequence of the

156
00:06:09,021 --> 00:06:10,490
neurophysiological damage.

157
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:15,820
Now Rama Shondra and found that if
you irrigated the contralateral ear,

158
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:21,860
say now if you pour cold
water in someone's ear,

159
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:25,520
it upsets their vestibular system and
their eyes will move back and forth like

160
00:06:25,521 --> 00:06:26,330
this.

161
00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:28,160
You can try that at a party if you want.

162
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:29,303
And

163
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,110
anyways,

164
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:35,150
Ramachandran was testing
vestibular function on these
patients and he irrigated

165
00:06:35,151 --> 00:06:38,810
the right ear with cold
water and they woke up.

166
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:42,830
And maybe what happened was
that that was shocking enough.

167
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:47,630
So imagine the networks in
the right hemisphere were
degraded but not completely

168
00:06:47,631 --> 00:06:51,830
gone and they needed a really high
threshold of activation to snap into

169
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:52,610
function.

170
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:53,810
So here's an example of that.

171
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:55,940
If you have Parkinson's disease managing,

172
00:06:55,941 --> 00:06:56,870
you're frozen there.

173
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:57,740
Okay.

174
00:06:57,740 --> 00:06:58,880
And I throw a ball at you,

175
00:06:58,881 --> 00:07:00,710
you'll go like this and catch it,

176
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:02,990
but you can't throw it back.

177
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:04,640
So you can,

178
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:06,260
the stimulus is enough.

179
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,720
That's enough to push you past threshold.

180
00:07:08,721 --> 00:07:10,220
But you can't do it voluntarily.

181
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:11,390
Now if you have Parkinson's,

182
00:07:11,391 --> 00:07:13,460
like right to the nth degree,

183
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:14,750
you won't even be able to catch it.

184
00:07:14,751 --> 00:07:16,880
But there's a stage where
you could still do that.

185
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:21,320
There's a great case study where
this grandpa was in a wheelchair,

186
00:07:21,321 --> 00:07:25,460
he had Parkinson's and his young grandson
was playing out on the dock and fell

187
00:07:25,461 --> 00:07:28,760
in the water and started to drown
and he got out of his wheelchair,

188
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:30,560
went into the ocean,

189
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:31,610
rescued him,

190
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:33,080
brought him onto the beach,

191
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:36,200
sat back down in his wheelchair
and was paralyzed again.

192
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:37,281
So that was enough.

193
00:07:37,281 --> 00:07:39,710
So you can imagine there
was enough network left.

194
00:07:39,711 --> 00:07:44,711
So if the emotional tension became high
enough that the degraded circuits could

195
00:07:45,051 --> 00:07:45,890
still function.

196
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:47,000
So,

197
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:47,301
okay,

198
00:07:47,301 --> 00:07:49,850
so back to remise Shondra
so you irrigate the year,

199
00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:53,470
all of a sudden the right
hemisphere connections flash,

200
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:56,810
the remainders managed to
connect and the person goes,

201
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:57,531
oh my God,

202
00:07:57,531 --> 00:07:58,670
I've had a terrible stroke.

203
00:07:58,671 --> 00:08:00,260
I've lost the left side of my body.

204
00:08:00,261 --> 00:08:01,370
They're crying.

205
00:08:01,371 --> 00:08:03,620
They're like completely catastrophic.

206
00:08:03,621 --> 00:08:05,000
Lee overwhelmed by it.

207
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:09,680
And then 20 minutes later the they
effects wear off and they snap back in and

208
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:11,113
now they,

209
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,590
they've lost her left side again.

210
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:13,430
They don't remember it.

211
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:18,820
And so what seems to happen is that
the right hemisphere is collecting a

212
00:08:20,301 --> 00:08:21,680
normalist information.

213
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:22,910
That's what it does.

214
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,560
That's what it does when you're dreaming,

215
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:25,011
it's,

216
00:08:25,011 --> 00:08:25,251
it's,

217
00:08:25,251 --> 00:08:26,084
it's,

218
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:31,240
it's representing that
anomalous information in
image form and sort of slowly

219
00:08:31,491 --> 00:08:34,730
passing it to the left hemisphere
so it doesn't overwhelm it.

220
00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:36,530
And maybe if it gets overwhelming,

221
00:08:36,531 --> 00:08:39,800
you wake up and you're afraid and you
tell someone about the dream that helps

222
00:08:39,801 --> 00:08:40,940
you figure out what it was.

223
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:41,983
But anyways,

224
00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:46,400
so that the right hemisphere is always
trying to tap the left hemisphere into

225
00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:47,900
transformation,

226
00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:49,003
right?

227
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:53,900
So now imagine that that can
happen a little bit or a lot.

228
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:57,600
So maybe you're just ignoring a
little bit of anomalous information.

229
00:08:57,810 --> 00:09:00,720
You just have some mildly
frightening dreams.

230
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:04,080
Or maybe you've just stacked up a whole
bunch of things that you're ignoring.

231
00:09:04,081 --> 00:09:08,310
And there's some major league monsters
that you haven't contended with.

232
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:13,370
Maybe there's situations where the right
hemisphere is stored up enough counter

233
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:17,400
enough of a counter hypothesis,

234
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:17,971
let's say,

235
00:09:17,971 --> 00:09:20,760
about how the world
works make making sense.

236
00:09:20,761 --> 00:09:25,761
Out of all those things that you've
ignored that one day it just goes snap and

237
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:30,840
you're a new personality and maybe
the new personality isn't addicted.

238
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:34,590
So it's something like
it's something like that.

239
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:35,880
I think.
