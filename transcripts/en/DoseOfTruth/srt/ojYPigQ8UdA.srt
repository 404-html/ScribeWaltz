1
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:07,201
It was a,

2
00:00:07,201 --> 00:00:10,560
it was about advancement and it was also
about the claim that somehow they have

3
00:00:10,561 --> 00:00:11,760
like special expertise.

4
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:13,470
This is a special technical language.

5
00:00:13,471 --> 00:00:14,460
No one else can understand it.

6
00:00:14,461 --> 00:00:15,420
Only only weekend,

7
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:19,590
but what's absurd about it absolutely
ludicrous is that these people,

8
00:00:19,591 --> 00:00:19,820
these,

9
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:24,820
these American academics are imitating
the contorted language of French at the

10
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:27,420
translations from the French.

11
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:28,240
Okay.

12
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:30,360
When lack call is translated into,

13
00:00:30,361 --> 00:00:31,440
into English,

14
00:00:31,441 --> 00:00:31,710
right.

15
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:33,180
There's a contortion there.

16
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:33,690
Okay.

17
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:33,961
What he's,

18
00:00:33,961 --> 00:00:34,191
what he,

19
00:00:34,191 --> 00:00:37,080
what he was trying to do
in French was to break up,

20
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:37,291
okay.

21
00:00:37,291 --> 00:00:40,890
The neo classical formulations
that descended from Ross scene,

22
00:00:40,891 --> 00:00:42,000
there was something that was going on.

23
00:00:42,001 --> 00:00:44,370
Those are sabotage of the
French language going on.

24
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:45,780
There was necessary in France,

25
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:47,340
not necessarily in English.

26
00:00:47,341 --> 00:00:50,510
We have this long tradition
of poetry going back to Judah,

27
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:51,690
Shakespeare and Chaucer.

28
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:52,230
We have,

29
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:53,910
we have our own language.

30
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:56,160
We're far more vital than
that than the French.

31
00:00:56,580 --> 00:00:58,650
The French constrained
their language all the time.

32
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:02,840
By my dear absurdity
in the amateur is ism.

33
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:03,350
Okay.

34
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:07,050
Of of American academics
trying to imitate,

35
00:01:07,051 --> 00:01:07,470
okay.

36
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:11,970
A translation of lack hall when
like doing something in France.

37
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:16,080
That is absolutely not necessary and
indeed wrong to be doing in English,

38
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:19,410
but the other cynical abandonment,

39
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:19,651
okay.

40
00:01:19,651 --> 00:01:20,930
Of the great tradition of,

41
00:01:20,931 --> 00:01:21,091
of,

42
00:01:21,091 --> 00:01:21,271
of,

43
00:01:21,271 --> 00:01:21,900
of,

44
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:22,201
of uh,

45
00:01:22,201 --> 00:01:26,700
of the English departments and I felt
that the true radicalism was not about

46
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:28,740
adding on other departments.

47
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:28,921
Okay.

48
00:01:28,921 --> 00:01:31,170
So we have African American
studies and you know,

49
00:01:31,171 --> 00:01:32,790
end to end in women's studies and so on.

50
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:36,510
The true radicalism would we have
been just to shatter the departmental

51
00:01:36,511 --> 00:01:37,021
structure.

52
00:01:37,021 --> 00:01:37,950
That's what I wanted.

53
00:01:37,951 --> 00:01:41,100
I feel that was the authentic
revolutionary 1960 going to do.

54
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:41,620
Right.

55
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:43,530
Do I look to them to
blend all the literature,

56
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:44,340
literature studies?

57
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:44,470
Yeah.

58
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:45,271
It's all these together.

59
00:01:45,271 --> 00:01:45,870
Okay.

60
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:50,040
Do have to make easier to make an
interdisciplinary kind of organization,

61
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:50,520
you know,

62
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:53,850
a little bit closer to the British
model where a person can pursue related

63
00:01:53,851 --> 00:01:54,301
subjects,

64
00:01:54,301 --> 00:01:55,440
overlapping subjects.

65
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,081
I did it,

66
00:01:56,081 --> 00:01:56,330
it,

67
00:01:56,330 --> 00:01:56,560
these,

68
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:56,850
these,

69
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:58,170
this departmental models.

70
00:01:58,171 --> 00:01:58,471
Okay.

71
00:01:58,471 --> 00:01:59,030
Are,

72
00:01:59,030 --> 00:01:59,340
were,

73
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:01,260
were to me totalitarian to begin with.

74
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:01,441
Okay.

75
00:02:01,441 --> 00:02:04,120
Separating language into fiefdoms and,

76
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:04,521
and what,

77
00:02:04,521 --> 00:02:06,570
what does the to create English,

78
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:08,070
WWE women's studies department.

79
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:08,850
Absolutely.

80
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:09,900
I out of the air,

81
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:11,940
just snap your fingers and
create women's studies.

82
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:14,550
The English department had
taken a century to develop.

83
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:14,821
Okay.

84
00:02:14,821 --> 00:02:16,350
The way it was a huge argument.

85
00:02:16,351 --> 00:02:16,531
Okay.

86
00:02:16,531 --> 00:02:17,060
Within,

87
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:17,650
within it.

88
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:18,090
All right.

89
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:19,620
And all of a sudden to create,

90
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:19,921
okay.

91
00:02:19,921 --> 00:02:20,820
It department,

92
00:02:20,821 --> 00:02:22,840
would they politicize
agenda from the start?

93
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:23,280
Hey,

94
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,630
by people without any training,

95
00:02:24,631 --> 00:02:25,890
whatever in that field.

96
00:02:25,891 --> 00:02:26,130
Right.

97
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:26,790
What should be the,

98
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:27,960
what should be the
parameters of the field,

99
00:02:27,961 --> 00:02:29,290
which should be the
requirements of their field.

100
00:02:29,291 --> 00:02:30,750
How about biology?

101
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:31,110
Okay.

102
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:32,520
If you're going to be discussing gender,

103
00:02:32,521 --> 00:02:34,650
that should have been a
number one requirement.

104
00:02:34,651 --> 00:02:35,130
Okay.

105
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:37,410
As part of any women's
studies department or program.

106
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,250
But no.

107
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:38,700
Okay.

108
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:39,810
It was all hands off.

109
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:43,950
It was just the administrators want it
to solve a public relations problem.

110
00:02:43,951 --> 00:02:44,310
Right.

111
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:46,710
They had a situation with
very few women faculty.

112
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:49,530
Are you nationwide at a time
when the women's movement had,

113
00:02:49,531 --> 00:02:50,430
had just started up,

114
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:52,030
the spotlight of attention was,

115
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:52,913
was on them.

116
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:53,401
They want,

117
00:02:53,401 --> 00:02:54,870
they needed women faculty fast.

118
00:02:54,871 --> 00:02:57,600
They needed the women's
subject on the agenda fast.

119
00:02:57,601 --> 00:02:57,870
Right.

120
00:02:57,870 --> 00:02:58,980
So they just like Poof,

121
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:01,150
let there be women's studies.

122
00:03:01,151 --> 00:03:01,451
Okay.

123
00:03:01,451 --> 00:03:03,430
And now we'll just hire some women.

124
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,110
It usually from English
departments and you know,

125
00:03:05,111 --> 00:03:07,810
he hit here and there and
we'll just throw them together.

126
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:08,930
You invent it,

127
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:09,850
you say what it is.

128
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:14,880
So that's why women said he's got frozen
at a certain point of the ideology of

129
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:18,070
the early 1970s I was
already in revolt from it.

130
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:18,460
Okay.

131
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:21,870
I was a precursor in terms of my
endorsement of feminism before,

132
00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:24,130
before even now it was created.

133
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:24,670
Right.

134
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:25,410
But I couldn't,

135
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:25,620
yeah.

136
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:28,150
I couldn't even have a conversation
with any of these women.

137
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:30,640
They were hysterical about
this subject of biology.

138
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:32,470
They knew nothing about hormones and I,

139
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:33,021
I mean I,

140
00:03:33,021 --> 00:03:35,020
I w I probably got in
fist fights over this.

141
00:03:35,021 --> 00:03:35,261
They went,

142
00:03:35,261 --> 00:03:37,870
people were so convinced
that biology had nothing,

143
00:03:37,871 --> 00:03:39,820
whatever to do with gender differences.

144
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:44,410
That also seems to me to be related
to the postmodern emphasis on power.

145
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:44,830
Yes.

146
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:45,910
Because there's a,

147
00:03:45,911 --> 00:03:49,390
there's something terrible under round
going on there and that is an eye.

148
00:03:49,391 --> 00:03:52,840
I think this is the sort of thing that
was reflected in the Soviet Union to in

149
00:03:52,841 --> 00:03:53,080
the,

150
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:56,350
especially in the 20s when there was
this idea of radical idea that you could

151
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,150
remake human beings entirely,

152
00:03:58,151 --> 00:03:58,391
right?

153
00:03:58,391 --> 00:04:00,160
Because they had no essential nature.

154
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:05,320
And so if your fundamental hypothesis
is that nothing exists except power,

155
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:06,340
and you believe that,

156
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:08,620
then that also gives you the right,

157
00:04:08,621 --> 00:04:13,090
in some sense to exercise your power
at the creation of the kind of humanity

158
00:04:13,091 --> 00:04:15,040
that your utopian vision envisions.

159
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:16,640
Then that has no that,

160
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:20,950
and that also seems to me to justify the
postmodern insistence that everything

161
00:04:20,951 --> 00:04:22,540
is only a linguistic construct.

162
00:04:22,541 --> 00:04:24,640
It again goes down to the notion of power,

163
00:04:24,641 --> 00:04:25,241
which Dera,

164
00:04:25,241 --> 00:04:27,790
dawn's Sukkot and lockout or
some bloody obsessed with.

165
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:28,571
And so,

166
00:04:28,571 --> 00:04:30,650
and it seems to me what
they're trying to do is to,

167
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:35,410
to take all the potential power for the
creation of human beings to themselves

168
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,690
without any bounding
conditions whatsoever,

169
00:04:37,691 --> 00:04:38,170
right?

170
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:39,010
There's no history,

171
00:04:39,011 --> 00:04:40,180
there's no biology,

172
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:41,350
there's and,

173
00:04:41,351 --> 00:04:44,950
and everything is a fluid culture
that can be manipulated at will.

174
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:46,290
And so I mean in,

175
00:04:46,291 --> 00:04:46,901
in Canada,

176
00:04:46,901 --> 00:04:50,290
there a terrible arguments right
now about biological essentialism,

177
00:04:50,291 --> 00:04:50,810
let's say.

178
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:52,240
And one of the things that happened,

179
00:04:52,241 --> 00:04:54,970
which was something I objected
to precisely a year ago,

180
00:04:54,971 --> 00:04:59,230
is that the social constructionist view
of human identity has been built now

181
00:04:59,231 --> 00:05:00,340
under Canadian law.

182
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:04,690
So there's an insistence
that biological sex,

183
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:06,310
gender identity,

184
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,450
gender expression,

185
00:05:07,451 --> 00:05:12,130
and sexual proclivity very independently
with no causal relationship between any

186
00:05:12,131 --> 00:05:12,964
of the levels.

187
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:14,230
And so that's in the law.

188
00:05:14,231 --> 00:05:15,490
And not only is it in the law,

189
00:05:15,491 --> 00:05:16,720
it's being taught everywhere.

190
00:05:16,721 --> 00:05:18,100
It's being taught in the armed forces,

191
00:05:18,101 --> 00:05:19,300
it's being taught in the police.

192
00:05:19,301 --> 00:05:22,930
It's being taught to the elementary school
kids and the junior high school kids.

193
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:24,250
And underneath it all,

194
00:05:24,251 --> 00:05:28,810
I see this terrible striving for arbitrary
power that's associated with this

195
00:05:28,811 --> 00:05:30,310
crazy utopianism and,

196
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:31,110
and,

197
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:31,660
and,

198
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:33,520
but I still don't exactly understand it.

199
00:05:33,521 --> 00:05:34,241
I don't like,

200
00:05:34,241 --> 00:05:35,290
I don't understand that.

201
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,870
What seems to be the
hatred that motivates it,

202
00:05:37,871 --> 00:05:39,190
that you see bubbling up,

203
00:05:39,191 --> 00:05:39,791
for example,

204
00:05:39,791 --> 00:05:41,170
in identity politics and,

205
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:45,280
and in the desire to do nothing but
let's say demolish the patriarchy.
