1
00:00:02,650 --> 00:00:07,140
You bring to bear on the world
and a priori perceptual structure,

2
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:11,970
and that's really an embodied structure
and it's a consequence of the three and

3
00:00:11,971 --> 00:00:15,840
a half billion years that you've
spent putting your body together,

4
00:00:15,841 --> 00:00:20,370
which is a tremendous amount of time
and not only your body but your mind of

5
00:00:20,371 --> 00:00:20,761
course,

6
00:00:20,761 --> 00:00:24,810
because your mind is part of your
body and very much embedded within it.

7
00:00:24,811 --> 00:00:25,340
You know you,

8
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:28,500
you tend to think that you have your
brain in your head and it's sort of

9
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:30,480
floating separate from
the rest of your body,

10
00:00:30,481 --> 00:00:31,830
but it's not really true.

11
00:00:31,831 --> 00:00:36,831
Your tremendous massive system of
neurons running through your entire body,

12
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:43,260
autonomic neurons in the
autonomic nervous system.

13
00:00:43,261 --> 00:00:44,820
Then there on the central nervous system.

14
00:00:44,821 --> 00:00:45,900
So that's a lot of neurons.

15
00:00:45,901 --> 00:00:50,640
And then your central nervous system of
course enables you to exercise voluntary

16
00:00:50,641 --> 00:00:54,690
control over your musculature and
also to receive information from it.

17
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:56,700
Your brain is really
distributed through your body.

18
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:01,920
One of the things you may not know is
that people who are paraplegic can walk.

19
00:01:01,921 --> 00:01:02,370
If you,

20
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:04,050
if you suspend them above a treadmill,

21
00:01:04,051 --> 00:01:06,960
their legs will walk by themselves
with no voluntary control.

22
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:10,440
So your spine is capable
of quite complex activity.

23
00:01:10,441 --> 00:01:10,831
In fact,

24
00:01:10,831 --> 00:01:11,401
when you walk,

25
00:01:11,401 --> 00:01:15,300
mostly it's a controlled fall and
mostly your spine is doing it and so,

26
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:18,090
so anyways,

27
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:23,120
the point of all that is that you don't
have a blank slate consciousness that's

28
00:01:24,451 --> 00:01:29,451
interpreting a world that manifests
itself as segregated objects in some

29
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:30,991
straight forward.

30
00:01:30,991 --> 00:01:35,880
Since you have a built in interpretive
system that's extraordinarily deeply

31
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:40,440
embedded and invisible because you
might think about it as the implicit

32
00:01:40,441 --> 00:01:41,940
structure of your unconscious.

33
00:01:41,941 --> 00:01:46,941
It's what it's what gives rise to your
conscious experience and and it presents

34
00:01:46,981 --> 00:01:48,060
you with the world.

35
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:50,920
That's one way of thinking about it and
it's a good way of thinking about it.

36
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:54,840
It's the psychoanalytic way of thinking
about it as well as the neuroscientific

37
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:58,590
way of thinking about it because one
of the things that's pretty interesting

38
00:01:58,591 --> 00:01:59,880
about modern neuroscientist,

39
00:01:59,881 --> 00:02:01,230
especially at the top rate ones,

40
00:02:01,231 --> 00:02:03,960
and those are usually the ones that are
working on emotions as far as I've been

41
00:02:03,961 --> 00:02:08,961
able to tell are are often quite
enamored of the psychoanalysts.

42
00:02:09,721 --> 00:02:14,610
Jaak Panksepp was a good example of that
because they came to understand that

43
00:02:14,611 --> 00:02:19,611
the psychoanalysts insistence
on underlying unconscious
personified motivations

44
00:02:21,061 --> 00:02:23,670
was actually an accurate
reflection of how the brain worked.

45
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:28,590
And sort of think of yourself as a
loose collection of autonomous spirits.

46
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:31,940
It's governed by some
overarching identity is,

47
00:02:31,941 --> 00:02:32,201
is,

48
00:02:32,201 --> 00:02:33,930
is a reasonable way of thinking about it.
