1
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:09,270
Here today in Manhattan,

2
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:13,250
talking to Doctor Jonathan
Heit who's a professor at Nyu.

3
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:13,770
And,

4
00:00:13,770 --> 00:00:14,603
uh,

5
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:16,130
I'm here for a bunch of reasons.

6
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:18,770
Jonathan isn't extremely
interesting researcher.

7
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:22,490
I've been following his work on disgust
and political belief for literally,

8
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:23,510
literally for decades.

9
00:00:23,511 --> 00:00:27,260
It was one of the first people who
started to do serious research on disgust,

10
00:00:27,261 --> 00:00:30,740
which is its own emotional system and
therefore very much worth attending to.

11
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:31,580
Um,

12
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:34,640
but we also have some
other interests in common.

13
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:34,880
Uh,

14
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:38,570
Jonathan also started this institute
called the Heterodox Academy,

15
00:00:38,571 --> 00:00:42,620
which is attempting to bring back
a reasonable diversity of views,

16
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:46,370
what he regards as a reasonable
diversity of views to university,

17
00:00:46,371 --> 00:00:47,204
faculty and,

18
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:48,750
and campuses and discussion.

19
00:00:48,751 --> 00:00:49,584
So,

20
00:00:49,630 --> 00:00:50,180
um,

21
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:51,410
I first met Jonathan,

22
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,950
it's going to be just about 30 years ago,

23
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:56,570
25 years ago,

24
00:00:56,580 --> 00:00:57,770
eight 2014,

25
00:00:57,980 --> 00:00:58,161
yeah,

26
00:00:58,161 --> 00:00:58,420
20.

27
00:00:58,420 --> 00:00:59,000
I'm sorry,

28
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,200
the 1994.

29
00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:00,381
Oh,

30
00:01:00,381 --> 00:01:01,430
it was in 1994.

31
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:01,730
Yeah,

32
00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:02,000
yeah.

33
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:02,330
Right,

34
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:02,630
right.

35
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:03,321
So yeah,

36
00:01:03,321 --> 00:01:05,230
you came to do a job talk at Harvard too,

37
00:01:05,231 --> 00:01:07,220
at for an assistant
professorship position,

38
00:01:07,221 --> 00:01:10,080
and I'd been aware of your
work on discuss then and,

39
00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:14,030
and agitated hard for them to hire
you because I thought it was of great

40
00:01:14,031 --> 00:01:14,661
significance,

41
00:01:14,661 --> 00:01:16,520
which turned out to be exactly the case.

42
00:01:16,521 --> 00:01:18,140
So what do you remember about that?

43
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:21,200
I remember I was so excited to
have an interview at Harvard.

44
00:01:21,201 --> 00:01:23,660
It was my only interview
if I didn't get that job.

45
00:01:23,661 --> 00:01:25,910
I had no job for the following year.

46
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:31,280
And it was a very strange day in which
I didn't feel particularly welcome or

47
00:01:31,281 --> 00:01:31,731
wanted.

48
00:01:31,731 --> 00:01:36,731
And then I had my session with you
in which he was this guy who was had,

49
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,550
he actually got a job at Harvard
and he was studying young,

50
00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:43,220
which is like almost taboo.

51
00:01:43,221 --> 00:01:45,470
And he was talking about
dreams and creativity.

52
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:46,820
And so I just,

53
00:01:46,821 --> 00:01:48,380
that was the really bright,

54
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:51,710
that was the bright memory of the
day was our hour long conversation.
