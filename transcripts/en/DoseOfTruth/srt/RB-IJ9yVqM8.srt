1
00:00:06,490 --> 00:00:07,323
Learning theory,

2
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:08,793
behaviorism,

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:09,910
there are in conditions,

4
00:00:09,911 --> 00:00:10,744
rewards.

5
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:13,630
Those are rewards you don't have to learn.

6
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:17,530
Those are the things that bring
a motivated state to its closure,

7
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:19,240
roughly speaking,

8
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:21,640
and that makes you satisfied.

9
00:00:21,641 --> 00:00:22,330
Satiation.

10
00:00:22,330 --> 00:00:24,460
That by the way is
associated with Serotonin.

11
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:27,790
Serotonin is a satiating neurochemical,

12
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:30,490
so if you're hot levels
of Serotonin are high,

13
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:31,660
you're kind of satisfied,

14
00:00:31,661 --> 00:00:35,380
which means you don't experience a lot
of positive emotion or a lot of negative

15
00:00:35,381 --> 00:00:35,681
emotion.

16
00:00:35,681 --> 00:00:36,940
You're just kind of satisfied.

17
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:38,500
It's a high dominance thing.

18
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:42,100
It's like all the consumer story
rewards are there when you need them.

19
00:00:42,490 --> 00:00:44,920
You don't have to worry and you
don't have to get too excited.

20
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:51,250
Conditioned rewards or incentive rewards
indicate progress towards a consumer to

21
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:52,390
consumer Tory reward.

22
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:54,250
They can be learned or condition,

23
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:57,940
but they can also be a Nate and their
associated with dopaminergic activation

24
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:01,390
and that's the exploration circuit
that comes out of the hypothalamus.

25
00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:04,900
Half the hypothalamus
does goal specification.

26
00:01:06,110 --> 00:01:06,600
Okay,

27
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,160
and the other half does exploration.

28
00:01:08,161 --> 00:01:09,660
And so again,

29
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:14,040
if you're pursuing something that's
an identifiable goal and you fail,

30
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:16,890
well then you're going to back off.

31
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:17,880
That's negative emotion.

32
00:01:17,881 --> 00:01:21,300
Then you're going to start to explore
and that's that dopaminergic circuit.

33
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:25,700
What's associated with
dopaminergic activation,

34
00:01:28,370 --> 00:01:29,121
exploration,

35
00:01:29,121 --> 00:01:29,751
extroversion,

36
00:01:29,751 --> 00:01:30,381
happiness,

37
00:01:30,381 --> 00:01:31,040
play,

38
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:31,970
enthusiasm,

39
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,760
assertiveness and the
positive element of novelty.

40
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:35,631
Okay,

41
00:01:35,631 --> 00:01:36,770
so that makes sense.

42
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:38,300
Anybody have any questions?

43
00:01:38,301 --> 00:01:42,290
I know that's a lot of information but
I kind of designed this part of the

44
00:01:42,291 --> 00:01:46,370
course so that at this point the levels
of analysis would stack up so that you

45
00:01:46,371 --> 00:01:48,170
could understand them simultaneously.

46
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:53,720
So the hypothalamus sets up
your frames of motivation

47
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,760
running one of those to the co two.

48
00:01:58,761 --> 00:02:00,220
It's positive conclusion.

49
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:01,240
That satisfying.

50
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:03,070
That's innate.

51
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,110
It's because it's conservatory reward.

52
00:02:05,111 --> 00:02:05,950
You'll work for that.

53
00:02:06,610 --> 00:02:08,800
Anything that indicates
that that might happen,

54
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:10,690
that's incentive reward.

55
00:02:10,691 --> 00:02:11,411
You can learn that.

56
00:02:11,411 --> 00:02:12,850
But some of it's also a Nate,

57
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:16,660
which is where the behaviors didn't
know that cause they thought of all the,

58
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:19,540
all the secondary stuff that
condition stuff has learned.

59
00:02:19,541 --> 00:02:20,470
Its not all learned.

60
00:02:20,471 --> 00:02:21,640
Some of it's already prepared.

61
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:22,900
You see a snake,

62
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:23,680
that's a threat.

63
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,730
You don't have to learn that.

64
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:28,090
So fires sort of like that as well.

65
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:28,810
Um,

66
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:29,950
blood is like that.

67
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:31,270
Teeth are like that.

68
00:02:31,271 --> 00:02:32,740
Staring eyes are like that.

69
00:02:32,741 --> 00:02:34,780
Predatory postures are like that.

70
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,153
Um,

71
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:37,923
loud,

72
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:39,550
loud vocalizations,

73
00:02:39,551 --> 00:02:41,860
especially if they're like low,

74
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:44,020
low in frequency,

75
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:45,700
they indicate a large animal.

76
00:02:45,701 --> 00:02:48,730
All those things are things you don't
have to learn to be afraid of because

77
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:52,690
they've been so consistently dangerous
in the past that you've built up a

78
00:02:52,691 --> 00:02:55,390
circuit that aren't responds
automatically to the question.

79
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:02,110
It seems like there will,

80
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,560
at least in the example that he did,

81
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:05,550
but I'm kind of mutually eggs

82
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:08,140
or did you know what I mean?

83
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:08,551
Yeah,

84
00:03:08,551 --> 00:03:09,390
it's complicated,

85
00:03:09,391 --> 00:03:09,670
you know,

86
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:12,270
because they do play a
bit of an inhibitory role,

87
00:03:12,271 --> 00:03:13,620
but they're separate circuits,

88
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:14,611
you know,

89
00:03:14,611 --> 00:03:17,970
so you can be very extroverted
and very high in negative emotion.

90
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:18,610
Okay.

91
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:19,443
So,

92
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:24,870
and you can be very emotionally stable
and very low in extroversion too.

93
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:25,561
So,

94
00:03:25,561 --> 00:03:27,810
but they are definitely
separate things now.

95
00:03:27,811 --> 00:03:28,350
It's hard,

96
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:28,950
you know,

97
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:31,470
you can flip from laughing
to crying very rapidly,

98
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:32,431
you know?

99
00:03:32,431 --> 00:03:36,420
So people are very much capable of
experiencing mixed states of positive and

100
00:03:36,421 --> 00:03:37,254
negative emotion.

101
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:40,980
Plus there are forms of manic depressive
disorder where people are manic and

102
00:03:40,981 --> 00:03:42,420
depressed at the same time,

103
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:45,750
which I would recommend the
people I know that have had that,

104
00:03:45,751 --> 00:03:47,970
they seem to think that
is certainly not fun.

105
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:49,373
So

106
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:52,703
agitation,

107
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:54,990
tremendous agitation.

108
00:03:55,530 --> 00:03:58,770
So you're probably sort of like that
when you're deeply confused and you're

109
00:03:58,771 --> 00:03:59,970
really bothered by it,

110
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:01,800
cause then the thread circuits are going,

111
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:03,660
but you're also sort of
wandering around going,

112
00:04:03,661 --> 00:04:03,841
oh,

113
00:04:03,841 --> 00:04:04,800
what am I going to do?

114
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:05,843
That's all.

115
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,120
That's all like approach
behavior approach.

116
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:11,130
Motivation isn't always positive a,

117
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:12,420
I mean most of the time it is,

118
00:04:12,421 --> 00:04:16,140
but intensity measures and
controllability matters too,

119
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,393
so,

120
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:18,653
okay.

121
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:21,420
Unconditioned punishments,

122
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:23,910
fundamentally they produce pain.

123
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:29,120
They also tend to Ha if you
run a behavioral routine
or a motivated framework

124
00:04:32,251 --> 00:04:33,510
that results in punishment,

125
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:36,240
you're less likely to run
it again in the future.

126
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,193
That's learning.

127
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:39,900
If you run a motivated frame and it works,

128
00:04:39,901 --> 00:04:41,460
you're more likely to
run it in the future.

129
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:42,840
That's learning too,

130
00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:46,530
so I'm conditioned.

131
00:04:46,531 --> 00:04:49,290
Punishments decreased the probability
that you're going to run to given

132
00:04:49,291 --> 00:04:51,600
motivational frame because it failed.

133
00:04:51,601 --> 00:04:51,841
Right.

134
00:04:51,841 --> 00:04:52,080
Do you,

135
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,580
you ran out and you got hurt.

136
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:54,960
It's like don't do that again.

137
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:58,380
That's part of the purpose
of memory and the pain,

138
00:04:58,381 --> 00:05:00,150
like emotions just to say it again.

139
00:05:00,151 --> 00:05:00,984
Our pain,

140
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:02,280
frustration,

141
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:03,143
disappointment,

142
00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:04,140
grief,

143
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:05,850
sadness is in there as well.

144
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:08,040
So those are paying
like states of emotion,

145
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:10,470
conditioned punishments.

146
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:14,100
Those are things that indicate
that a punishment is likely.

147
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:16,230
Some of them you can learn.

148
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:20,850
Some of them you don't have to because
they're already built into the negative.

149
00:05:20,851 --> 00:05:23,040
Emotions are dampened by Serotonin.

150
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:25,470
That's the fundamental brain system.

151
00:05:25,471 --> 00:05:26,290
Fundamentally,

152
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:29,130
it's the serotonergic system is
like a conductor of the orchestra.

153
00:05:29,131 --> 00:05:30,300
It keeps everything in,

154
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:32,910
in balance and Gaba.

155
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:36,000
Gaba is a anxiety or lytic,

156
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:37,350
it makes people less anxious.

157
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:38,243
It's indogenous.

158
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:39,240
Your brain produces it.

159
00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:42,690
If you take Valium or barbiturates,

160
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:44,580
they act on the Gaba system.

161
00:05:44,581 --> 00:05:45,600
It's so does alcohol.

162
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:49,380
That's part of the reason why people
like alcohol because it dampens anxiety.

163
00:05:49,381 --> 00:05:50,280
Now for some people,

164
00:05:50,281 --> 00:05:53,460
alcohol or also produces
dopaminergic activation,

165
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:58,220
so they really like alcohol because it
calms them down like they're not anxious

166
00:05:58,221 --> 00:06:03,221
anymore and it also feels it produces
incentive reward activation like cocaine.

167
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:05,030
So for some people,

168
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:07,010
alcohol is and absolutely deadly drug.

169
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:11,930
You can probably find out if you're
susceptible to alcoholism quite

170
00:06:11,931 --> 00:06:12,860
straightforwardly.

171
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:14,930
If you want to find out,

172
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:16,640
sit in a bar,

173
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:17,840
take your pulse

174
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:20,031
down,

175
00:06:20,031 --> 00:06:21,080
five shots,

176
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:23,211
four shots.

177
00:06:23,211 --> 00:06:24,044
If you're little,

178
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:25,281
you got to get your,

179
00:06:25,281 --> 00:06:28,730
you got to get your blood alcohol level
above legal intoxication or you won't be

180
00:06:28,731 --> 00:06:32,420
able to tell and then take your pulse
again 10 minutes later if your pulse has

181
00:06:32,421 --> 00:06:33,254
gone up,

182
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:34,850
eight beats are more,

183
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:39,440
watch it because you're probably
producing an opiate response to alcohol.

184
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:43,190
Secondary consequences of the opiate
responses is a dopaminergic response.

185
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:47,060
Reasonable probability that you'll
like alcohol enough to find it.

186
00:06:47,061 --> 00:06:48,500
Difficult to stop drinking.

187
00:06:48,501 --> 00:06:49,340
Once you start.

188
00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:50,660
Some of you are probably like that,

189
00:06:50,661 --> 00:06:50,871
right?

190
00:06:50,871 --> 00:06:51,561
You have a few drinks.

191
00:06:51,561 --> 00:06:52,880
It's like he ha,

192
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:55,730
that's how we do it in Alberta anyways,

193
00:06:56,090 --> 00:06:56,923
so,

194
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:01,700
so part of that killing the incentive
reward system and because it's an approach

195
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:04,490
system and it's being cued by the alcohol,

196
00:07:04,491 --> 00:07:09,491
you just continue to hit it and the
dopamine kicks only occur as your blood

197
00:07:10,671 --> 00:07:12,200
alcohol level is rising.

198
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,420
So you have to keep nailing it,

199
00:07:14,690 --> 00:07:17,720
nailing yourself with alcohol because
otherwise your blood alcohol level won't

200
00:07:17,721 --> 00:07:22,070
keep rising and you won't get that nice
enthusiasm and assertiveness that goes

201
00:07:22,071 --> 00:07:23,420
along with the pause.

202
00:07:23,421 --> 00:07:25,220
Development of alcohol,

203
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:27,831
neuroticism.

204
00:07:27,831 --> 00:07:29,750
So this is the neuroticism dimension.

205
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:31,063
Um,

206
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:34,070
there's this gender
difference in neuroticism.

207
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:36,890
Women are about half a standard deviation,

208
00:07:37,010 --> 00:07:38,900
higher negative emotion than men.

209
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:42,110
It's seems like a cross
cultural universal,

210
00:07:42,410 --> 00:07:44,000
the differences more enhanced.

211
00:07:44,001 --> 00:07:46,400
And he galitary in
states like Scandinavia,

212
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:49,280
which is exactly the opposite
of what you'd presume,

213
00:07:49,281 --> 00:07:49,461
right?

214
00:07:49,461 --> 00:07:50,120
If you were,

215
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:50,953
say us,

216
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:51,800
uh,

217
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:52,800
a radical,

218
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:55,970
can't remember the name.

219
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:58,910
If you are someone who believes that
everything occurs as a consequence of

220
00:07:58,911 --> 00:07:59,840
socialization,

221
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:02,120
as you equalize the society,

222
00:08:02,121 --> 00:08:05,660
the gender differences in personality
become larger rather than smaller.

223
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:06,620
So,

224
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:06,981
which is,

225
00:08:06,981 --> 00:08:07,520
you know,

226
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,780
not what anybody expected.

227
00:08:08,781 --> 00:08:09,680
But that's what happened.

228
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:14,060
So boys and girls seem to have about
the same level of negative emotion.

229
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:15,530
But as soon as puberty hits,

230
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:18,830
women become higher negative
emotion than men on average.

231
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:23,000
There's still a lot of overlap between
the genders and it never goes away again

232
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:24,500
across the life course.

233
00:08:24,501 --> 00:08:25,760
Once it kicks in in puberty,

234
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:27,050
and the reasons for that,

235
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,760
women are smaller,

236
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:29,210
they're,

237
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:30,710
their upper bodies are weaker,

238
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:31,910
so they're more physical.

239
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:33,920
They're there at a physical disadvantage.

240
00:08:33,921 --> 00:08:35,420
If they're in a dominance dispute,

241
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,100
they're sexually vulnerable,

242
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,140
plus they have to take care of infants.

243
00:08:39,141 --> 00:08:43,700
So I think those four things are probably
enough to tilt the nervous system of

244
00:08:43,701 --> 00:08:46,700
women more towards
negative negative emotion.

245
00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:50,300
I've often thought maybe that
women's Nate emotional systems,

246
00:08:50,301 --> 00:08:54,080
the negative ones in particular are
actually not tuned to the woman.

247
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,570
I think there are tuned to
the woman incent combination.

248
00:08:58,350 --> 00:08:59,350
So you know,

249
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:00,960
if you think about it from an,

250
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,330
if you think about it for bait,

251
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:07,110
it almost has to be that way because an
infant has to be carried around for like

252
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:07,470
a year and a half.

253
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:12,210
And so at that point when you have an
incident and maybe you're going to have 10

254
00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:13,470
you know you guys won't,

255
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:14,770
but in the evolutionary paths,

256
00:09:14,771 --> 00:09:15,630
that would have been the case.

257
00:09:15,631 --> 00:09:16,780
You'd have an infant for a much,

258
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:19,680
much of your life and then you'd be
a grandmother and have an incident.

259
00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:20,963
It's like,

260
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:25,350
why wouldn't your nervous system be tuned
at puberty for the two of you instead

261
00:09:25,351 --> 00:09:26,184
of one of you?

262
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:29,130
So how could it be any other way?

263
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:30,353
Anyways,

264
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:35,430
so you've got your hypothalamus and then
on top of that you've got some circuits

265
00:09:35,431 --> 00:09:36,810
that deal with memory and emotion.

266
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:39,840
So I'm going to run you through the
hippocampus and the Amygdala relatively

267
00:09:39,841 --> 00:09:40,590
quickly.

268
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:44,700
So this is a theory that was basically
put together by Sokolov who was a Russian

269
00:09:44,701 --> 00:09:48,720
neuropsychologist back in 1962 but
it's a variant of a theory that Norbert

270
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,540
Wiener developed back in the
forties so here's the idea.

271
00:09:52,890 --> 00:09:54,720
You wander through the world and you,

272
00:09:55,170 --> 00:09:56,880
if you're in a place that you know,

273
00:09:58,490 --> 00:09:59,323
okay,

274
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:00,630
your memory systems,

275
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:02,560
okay,

276
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:07,560
the HIPPA campus looks inside your
memory systems to see what it is that you

277
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:11,470
want to have happen based on
your understanding of the world.

278
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:12,790
Okay?

279
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:15,770
So you're in a motivated state,

280
00:10:15,771 --> 00:10:19,280
but you have certain expectations
that makes sense within that state.

281
00:10:19,281 --> 00:10:22,520
So the hippocampus is watching
what you think is going to happen.

282
00:10:22,521 --> 00:10:24,050
But remember that's motivated.

283
00:10:24,051 --> 00:10:25,310
It's not just the expectation.

284
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:29,150
And then the hippocampus is
also looking at the world.

285
00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:36,650
Now it's looking at it interpretation
of the world because you can't help but

286
00:10:36,661 --> 00:10:37,500
interpret the world.

287
00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:41,190
But fundamentally the hippocampus is
looking inside you and outside you.

288
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:46,290
And then it seeing if what's happening
inside and what's happening outside are

289
00:10:46,291 --> 00:10:47,124
the same,

290
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:51,150
which means you know what you're
doing and you know where you are.

291
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:52,590
And if they're the same.

292
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:53,910
So if it detects a match,

293
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:55,530
then the hippocampus,

294
00:10:55,531 --> 00:10:59,610
the inhibits the Amygdala
and the hypothalamus,

295
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:00,391
roughly speaking.

296
00:11:00,391 --> 00:11:01,860
Now what it actually seems to do,

297
00:11:02,490 --> 00:11:05,310
there's a little circuit in your brain
stem called the reticular activating

298
00:11:05,311 --> 00:11:05,970
circuit.

299
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:07,860
And it's the thing that
turns your brain on at night.

300
00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:10,470
If you're sleeping and you hear
a noise that you shouldn't hear,

301
00:11:10,471 --> 00:11:11,191
it's like bang,

302
00:11:11,191 --> 00:11:12,000
you're awake.

303
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,470
It's the reticular activating system.

304
00:11:13,471 --> 00:11:14,670
Way Down in your brainstem,

305
00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:19,350
puts your cortex into a
high arousal state and Poof,

306
00:11:19,351 --> 00:11:20,184
you're conscious.

307
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:25,550
Now the hippocampus tells the reticular
activating system to basically remain

308
00:11:26,011 --> 00:11:27,420
calm as well as,

309
00:11:27,421 --> 00:11:32,421
as long as what you're expecting and
desiring and what's happening are the same

310
00:11:33,211 --> 00:11:33,750
thing.

311
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:35,130
So it's sort of like it's saying,

312
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:37,880
I know you could jump up
and freak out and run about,

313
00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:41,100
but you don't have to right now because
everything's going according to plan.

314
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:44,520
But as soon as there's a
deviation that's an normally say,

315
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:45,870
then the hippocampus says,

316
00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:46,704
Whoa,

317
00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:48,270
something's wrong here.

318
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,350
And uh,

319
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:53,470
it does inhibits their
reticular activating system
that turns on your emotions,

320
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:54,640
especially your negative emotion,

321
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:58,420
but it primes your positive emotion
and it primes some of the hypothalamic

322
00:11:58,421 --> 00:11:59,860
circuits to or disinhibiting them.

323
00:11:59,861 --> 00:12:04,660
Because one way of solving the fact that
something isn't going well is to switch

324
00:12:04,661 --> 00:12:05,710
to something else.

325
00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:09,760
So it's sort of like there's a
bunch of circuits on underneath you,

326
00:12:10,090 --> 00:12:15,090
but they're being held back like race
horses in race horse and then something

327
00:12:15,431 --> 00:12:16,600
that you don't expect happens.

328
00:12:16,601 --> 00:12:19,720
And the gates come up a little
bit because then you're prepared.

329
00:12:19,721 --> 00:12:21,190
Now a lot of that's negative emotion.

330
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:21,611
Oh,

331
00:12:21,611 --> 00:12:22,600
you don't know where you are.

332
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:23,670
But a lot of,

333
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:26,770
a lot of the rest of it is be prepared
to do whatever the hell you might need to

334
00:12:26,771 --> 00:12:27,604
do next.

335
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:31,640
And so what normally the
hippocampus detects a,

336
00:12:31,641 --> 00:12:35,440
normally that's something unexpected
and then it does inhibits your lower

337
00:12:35,441 --> 00:12:37,390
circuitry and it gets you ready to go.

338
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:39,490
Now the problem is,

339
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:41,170
okay,

340
00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:44,140
how worried should you be when
something that you don't expect happens?

341
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:45,560
Okay.

342
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:47,420
An answer to that is you don't know.

343
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:51,380
That's a big problem with life
because now something went wrong.

344
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:52,760
Here's the possibilities.

345
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:54,410
You're not looking at the world,

346
00:12:54,411 --> 00:12:55,100
right?

347
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:56,750
So it's actually a perceptual problem,

348
00:12:56,930 --> 00:12:57,763
right?

349
00:12:58,170 --> 00:12:59,720
Like gray for example,

350
00:12:59,721 --> 00:13:01,940
believes that you just see
the world just like it is.

351
00:13:01,941 --> 00:13:03,140
Cause he's sort of a behaviorist.

352
00:13:03,141 --> 00:13:04,190
It's full of stimuli.

353
00:13:04,191 --> 00:13:05,210
You don't have to interpret them.

354
00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:06,081
That's wrong.

355
00:13:06,081 --> 00:13:07,010
You have to interpret them.

356
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:08,360
So if something goes wrong,

357
00:13:08,361 --> 00:13:10,340
it might be that you're
looking at things wrong,

358
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:12,380
your perceptual systems are out.

359
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:13,101
It's unlikely.

360
00:13:13,101 --> 00:13:14,570
But sometimes that's the case.

361
00:13:15,770 --> 00:13:16,461
But forget that.

362
00:13:16,461 --> 00:13:19,940
Let's say that you're looking at the
world correctly and you know your

363
00:13:19,941 --> 00:13:21,650
inferences about what went wrong,

364
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:26,960
what went wrong isn't the consequence of
you misperceiving it's a consequence of

365
00:13:26,961 --> 00:13:30,200
some stupid problem with your stupid plan.

366
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:33,440
The problem is you don't know
where the error is located.

367
00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:37,670
And that's why I think
there's temperament.

368
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:41,450
Sometimes if something unexpected happens,

369
00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:43,190
you should really freak out.

370
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:45,140
Other times you should ignore it,

371
00:13:45,530 --> 00:13:48,020
but you can't tell which of
those is true right away.

372
00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:51,560
So what happens is there's a
distribution with a little thing happens.

373
00:13:51,561 --> 00:13:55,430
Some people really get upset about it
and other people hardly care at all.

374
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:58,280
And sometimes the people who get
really upset about it or write,

375
00:13:58,460 --> 00:14:00,800
and sometimes the people who
don't care at all are right.

376
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:03,320
And that's why there's
variability in neuroticism,

377
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:05,091
okay?

378
00:14:05,091 --> 00:14:09,500
Now what you do when you're exploring
is you start to decompose your plan,

379
00:14:09,501 --> 00:14:09,830
right?

380
00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:10,131
If you're,

381
00:14:10,131 --> 00:14:10,491
if you,

382
00:14:10,491 --> 00:14:11,360
if you can manage it,

383
00:14:11,361 --> 00:14:11,781
if you're not,

384
00:14:11,781 --> 00:14:14,720
so like grip my anxiety
that you're paralyzed.

385
00:14:15,050 --> 00:14:16,490
Then you go into your plan and you think,

386
00:14:16,491 --> 00:14:16,940
well,

387
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:20,810
am I a complete like loser or is it
some micro thing that's gone wrong?

388
00:14:20,811 --> 00:14:23,600
And then you can start to decompose
it and reconstruct your plat.

389
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:24,650
Okay?

390
00:14:24,650 --> 00:14:25,483
So,

391
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:27,230
yeah,

392
00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:28,063
the other,

393
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:31,760
the other thing that this little
diagram helps you understand.

394
00:14:31,761 --> 00:14:32,091
It's like,

395
00:14:32,091 --> 00:14:32,331
look,

396
00:14:32,331 --> 00:14:35,190
what happens is when
you're laying out a plan,

397
00:14:35,191 --> 00:14:36,110
a motivated plan,

398
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:37,610
and a hole appears in it,

399
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,680
you have to figure out
why you fell in the hole.

400
00:14:39,681 --> 00:14:43,040
And then what you have to do is you have
to take that motivated plan that's kind

401
00:14:43,041 --> 00:14:46,490
of running on automatic and you have
to remember what it's made out of.

402
00:14:47,210 --> 00:14:48,990
And so what opens up underneath you when,

403
00:14:48,991 --> 00:14:51,350
when you've made a
mistake is the complexity,

404
00:14:51,530 --> 00:14:52,363
the plant,

405
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:56,180
and then also potentially the complexity
of the world on the off chance that

406
00:14:56,181 --> 00:14:57,260
you've misperceived it,

407
00:14:57,261 --> 00:14:57,471
right?

408
00:14:57,471 --> 00:14:58,010
You're just,

409
00:14:58,010 --> 00:14:58,843
someone might say,

410
00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:00,860
you're not understanding me properly.

411
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:01,641
You know,

412
00:15:01,641 --> 00:15:04,310
maybe there's something wrong with you
that's interfering with the perception

413
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:07,830
and then you have to do this massive
search to try to figure out where their

414
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:08,713
lives.

415
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:09,673
Now,

416
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:13,670
part of the reason I believe that
people stick to their beliefs so hard is

417
00:15:13,671 --> 00:15:17,450
because people don't like it when
the hole appears in one of their big

418
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:18,650
abstractions,

419
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:19,281
right?

420
00:15:19,281 --> 00:15:23,060
So they've got these high
order representations of the
world that are shorthand,

421
00:15:23,061 --> 00:15:24,440
ways of representing something.

422
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:26,360
They're sort of like axioms of faith.

423
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:27,733
And if they,

424
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:30,200
if a hole appears in one
of the axioms of faith,

425
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:34,010
then all this complexity comes
rushing up and it's overwhelming.

426
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:39,100
And so people hate it when you undermine
one of their high order abstractions.

427
00:15:40,010 --> 00:15:41,660
And so I think I told you this before,

428
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,460
don't do that in relationships,

429
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:43,881
right?

430
00:15:43,881 --> 00:15:45,800
It's best not to do it
to yourself as well.

431
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:47,630
I'll start with this.

432
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:49,130
These are Medusa's.

433
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:52,280
And what happens when you see the Medusa?

434
00:15:53,890 --> 00:15:54,071
Okay,

435
00:15:54,071 --> 00:15:54,480
so what,

436
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:55,550
what might that mean?

437
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,313
You bet it's the,

438
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:00,460
it's a prey response.

439
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:02,440
And so that's a sort of,

440
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:05,080
that's the sort of thing that occurs when

441
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:10,900
you're moving towards your goal in
your frame and the bottom drops out.

442
00:16:10,930 --> 00:16:11,260
It's like,

443
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:11,561
oh,

444
00:16:11,561 --> 00:16:12,394
what's there?

445
00:16:13,930 --> 00:16:14,763
You don't know.

446
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:16,960
So what's the logical first response?

447
00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:17,501
Well,

448
00:16:17,501 --> 00:16:18,460
if you're high in neuroticism,

449
00:16:18,461 --> 00:16:20,200
it's going to be this in a freeze.

450
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:21,633
And then,

451
00:16:21,970 --> 00:16:22,810
and only then,

452
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:24,850
if nothing else terrible happens to you,

453
00:16:24,851 --> 00:16:26,440
you'll start to relax a bit.

454
00:16:26,441 --> 00:16:29,160
And then maybe you'll start to
investigate the structure of your plan.

455
00:16:29,161 --> 00:16:31,630
And maybe you'll start to investigate
the structure of the world.

456
00:16:32,050 --> 00:16:34,390
And then from a
constructivist perspective,

457
00:16:34,391 --> 00:16:35,830
say once you start to do that,

458
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:38,200
you gather information from the world,

459
00:16:38,201 --> 00:16:41,410
and then you remake your plan and you
remake your conception of the world,

460
00:16:41,411 --> 00:16:42,700
and then you could move on.

461
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:47,170
So you do that under the guidance of
the positive and the negative emotions.
