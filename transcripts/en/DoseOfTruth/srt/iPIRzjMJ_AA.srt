1
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:08,423
Well,

2
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:11,100
so there's malevolence that
has to be contended with.

3
00:00:11,101 --> 00:00:14,880
And then the other element is that you
have to contend with the tragedy of life.

4
00:00:14,881 --> 00:00:16,140
And that's so in the,

5
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:18,840
in the passion of the Christ
did that and that story.

6
00:00:18,841 --> 00:00:21,210
Christ of course encounters
Satan and the desert.

7
00:00:21,211 --> 00:00:21,930
And so that's,

8
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:22,860
and he's tempted there.

9
00:00:22,861 --> 00:00:26,310
And so that's the encounter with
evil archetypically speaking.

10
00:00:26,311 --> 00:00:30,330
And then the crucifixion itself is the
encounter with the tragedy of life,

11
00:00:30,331 --> 00:00:30,541
right?

12
00:00:30,541 --> 00:00:33,210
It's betrayal and death
voluntarily accepted.

13
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,680
And so I understood that that was a
symbolic representation of the logos and

14
00:00:37,681 --> 00:00:40,260
that that was the they,

15
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:41,101
what would you say?

16
00:00:41,101 --> 00:00:46,101
The embodied manifestation of this heroic
path that mediated between these two

17
00:00:46,141 --> 00:00:48,120
extremes that was really useful.

18
00:00:48,121 --> 00:00:50,490
Like that was a really
useful discovery for me.

19
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:53,100
And because there was
implications to it too,

20
00:00:53,101 --> 00:00:53,790
and,

21
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:58,140
and profound implications that also seem
to work out in relationship to what I

22
00:00:58,141 --> 00:00:59,940
was learning about clinical psychology.

23
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:00,151
So,

24
00:01:00,151 --> 00:01:00,751
for example,

25
00:01:00,751 --> 00:01:03,450
one of the things you do if
you're a clinical psychologist,

26
00:01:03,451 --> 00:01:08,451
as you help people learn to encounter
things that they're afraid of in a

27
00:01:08,461 --> 00:01:09,510
controlled manner,

28
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:10,590
and they get less,

29
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:11,640
they don't get less afraid,

30
00:01:11,641 --> 00:01:12,480
they get braver.

31
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,170
So you actually act out the process
of confrontation with tragedy,

32
00:01:16,171 --> 00:01:18,000
voluntary confrontation with tragedy.

33
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:19,170
And that's curative.

34
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:22,800
It doesn't matter if you're exposing them
to their past or the present or things

35
00:01:22,801 --> 00:01:23,970
they're worried about in the future.

36
00:01:23,971 --> 00:01:26,190
As long as they decide
to do it voluntarily,

37
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,930
they get stronger and better.

38
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:28,771
So you think,

39
00:01:28,771 --> 00:01:28,891
well,

40
00:01:28,891 --> 00:01:30,180
what's the limit to that?

41
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:35,100
All the limit is to accept the
limitations and catastrophes of your own

42
00:01:35,101 --> 00:01:36,690
mortality voluntarily.

43
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:37,310
And,

44
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:40,230
and that's the potentially the
proper pathway through life,

45
00:01:40,231 --> 00:01:43,740
or at least it's the least
bad pathway through life,

46
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:44,910
which is something,

47
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:45,241
you know,

48
00:01:45,241 --> 00:01:49,950
and then I think the same can be said
fairly decisively for the willingness to

49
00:01:49,951 --> 00:01:50,910
grapple with,

50
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,190
with malevolence,

51
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:53,700
uh,

52
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:55,740
on a personal and individual level,

53
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:56,070
you know?

54
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:57,690
And so anyways,

55
00:01:57,691 --> 00:01:59,280
I started to lecture about that and,

56
00:01:59,400 --> 00:01:59,880
and,

57
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:03,450
and to lay out those ideas more and
more clearly over the years as I've been

58
00:02:03,451 --> 00:02:03,941
lecturing.

59
00:02:03,941 --> 00:02:06,390
And that's what I did for TV Ontario.

60
00:02:06,391 --> 00:02:09,960
And I think that that's why the
lectures became popular because,

61
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:10,861
you know,

62
00:02:10,861 --> 00:02:15,120
I'd put some words to ideas that people
already knew and could revitalize a

63
00:02:15,121 --> 00:02:18,360
symbolic vocabulary that people
had become divorced from.

64
00:02:18,361 --> 00:02:18,840
And,

65
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:22,800
and that there was a hole in the culture
exactly where those ideas needed to be.

66
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,930
And so people found that they were,

67
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:25,951
well,

68
00:02:25,951 --> 00:02:27,720
people tell me when they
come and talk to me,

69
00:02:27,721 --> 00:02:28,051
they said,

70
00:02:28,051 --> 00:02:28,884
well,

71
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:29,731
when you're talking,

72
00:02:29,731 --> 00:02:30,151
it's like,

73
00:02:30,151 --> 00:02:31,620
I already know what you're saying,

74
00:02:31,621 --> 00:02:33,090
but I don't have the words for it.

75
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,021
It's like,

76
00:02:34,021 --> 00:02:34,171
well,

77
00:02:34,171 --> 00:02:38,580
that's exactly what our marketable story
is like is that you all know the story.

78
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:39,421
You just don't know,

79
00:02:39,421 --> 00:02:40,910
you know it or you know,

80
00:02:40,911 --> 00:02:43,110
at a level that you can't articulate,

81
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:47,220
but you still recognize it when you see
it and you still act it out and you see

82
00:02:47,221 --> 00:02:48,090
it in other people.

83
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,080
But it's really,

84
00:02:49,081 --> 00:02:49,531
really,

85
00:02:49,531 --> 00:02:51,690
really good to have the words.

86
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:55,380
And that's partly why you should be
very careful about what you say and

87
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:57,840
particularly careful about what you write.
