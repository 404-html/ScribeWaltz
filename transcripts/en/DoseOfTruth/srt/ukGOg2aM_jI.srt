1
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:01,610
Um,

2
00:00:01,610 --> 00:00:06,610
can we revive the state of
Western civilization using
the new idea that God is

3
00:00:06,861 --> 00:00:07,694
dead?

4
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:08,783
Well,

5
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:13,290
it's the wrong question in some sense
because I think it's too diffuse.

6
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:14,730
To me,

7
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:19,110
they issue more is do you have problems
in your life that you're not addressing

8
00:00:19,111 --> 00:00:20,310
that you could solve?

9
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:22,050
And the answer is yes.

10
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:23,970
And it's an easy thing to figure out.

11
00:00:23,971 --> 00:00:25,710
You sit on your bed one morning and say,

12
00:00:25,711 --> 00:00:26,544
okay,

13
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,020
there's some things that need to be done
that I don't want to do that I could do

14
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:33,330
that would make things
better by the end of the day.

15
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:34,763
What are they?

16
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:35,341
Well,

17
00:00:35,341 --> 00:00:36,174
your,

18
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:38,190
your conscience will
deliver those suckers,

19
00:00:38,191 --> 00:00:39,400
no time flat map.

20
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:40,980
And then you might have to say,

21
00:00:40,981 --> 00:00:41,221
okay,

22
00:00:41,221 --> 00:00:44,550
well how do I entice myself
into doing a few of those?

23
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:46,530
And if you ask,

24
00:00:46,531 --> 00:00:48,540
instead of trying to
force yourself to do it,

25
00:00:48,541 --> 00:00:51,300
like you're a tyrant and
a slave at the same time,

26
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:55,710
you can usually negotiate with yourself
so that you'll start to sort those

27
00:00:55,711 --> 00:00:56,544
things out,

28
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:57,780
sort them out,

29
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:00,810
put your house in order and then move out.

30
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:03,060
Move on and out.

31
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:06,453
Yes.

32
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:08,190
That's a Freudian slip by the way.

33
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:09,733
Yeah,

34
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:11,960
so it's important
because the thing is you,

35
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:14,810
you have a practice domain right there.

36
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:18,840
There are things that are within
your grasp that you can fix,

37
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,540
fix them and you'll learn.

38
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,580
You'll learn cause it's
harder than it looks.

39
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:27,780
Fix them and you'll learn how to fix
things and then something else will beckon

40
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:29,580
as another problem that you could fix.

41
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:30,630
You know,

42
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:32,220
you all have your problems.

43
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:33,240
What does that mean?

44
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:35,190
Like there's an infinite number
of problems in the world.

45
00:01:35,191 --> 00:01:36,420
Some of them happened to be yours.

46
00:01:36,421 --> 00:01:37,254
Why is that?

47
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:38,820
I don't know exactly,

48
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,530
but you have your problems.

49
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:41,573
Great.

50
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:42,420
Solve them.

51
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:43,470
You know,

52
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:45,060
one of the things I
learned as a therapist,

53
00:01:45,061 --> 00:01:49,050
every therapist has to learn this is
because one of the things you wonder when

54
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:53,370
you're first starting to be a clinician
is how do you not take the catastrophes

55
00:01:53,371 --> 00:01:54,690
of your client's home with you?

56
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:57,990
And the answer to that is
because it's immoral to,

57
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:00,630
they're not your problems.

58
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:03,870
They're their problems like their,

59
00:02:03,871 --> 00:02:04,111
their,

60
00:02:04,111 --> 00:02:04,980
their life.

61
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:05,511
You all,

62
00:02:05,511 --> 00:02:06,900
your problems are your life.

63
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:10,410
You don't want to solve someone else's
problems for them because you take away

64
00:02:10,411 --> 00:02:11,210
the,

65
00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:12,150
the deep meaning.

66
00:02:12,151 --> 00:02:15,810
That's to be found in having them work
through the problems on their own.

67
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:17,430
And then you steal the credit.

68
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:19,200
Well I can help you with that.

69
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:19,980
It's like,

70
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:21,870
well yeah maybe,

71
00:02:21,871 --> 00:02:24,360
but I don't help you with
the next problem then.

72
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:26,280
So in any case,

73
00:02:26,281 --> 00:02:29,790
you sort of sort out the problems that
are right in front of you and you will,

74
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,380
it will make you grow very,

75
00:02:31,381 --> 00:02:34,620
very rapidly and then you'll be able to
sort out more complex problems without

76
00:02:34,621 --> 00:02:35,520
making them worse.

77
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:37,043
So,

78
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:41,630
so you mentioned that through
discussion and dialogue,

79
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:43,250
we can order the chaos,

80
00:02:43,251 --> 00:02:44,061
the world together,

81
00:02:44,061 --> 00:02:46,400
but do you not think that there
needs to be a higher creator,

82
00:02:46,401 --> 00:02:47,530
an essence of grapes?

83
00:02:47,531 --> 00:02:47,750
Fuck,

84
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:48,740
it would be possible.

85
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:51,350
Like how can we each being flawed,

86
00:02:51,351 --> 00:02:54,290
still even working together
create meaning or something good.

87
00:02:57,870 --> 00:02:58,703
Okay.

88
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:04,700
I,

89
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:06,680
we don't understand what we are,

90
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,950
we don't understand our own consciousness.

91
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:13,550
It has a quality of
some sort and it meant,

92
00:03:13,551 --> 00:03:15,170
it manifests itself within us.

93
00:03:15,171 --> 00:03:16,760
It's an orientation towards the good.

94
00:03:16,761 --> 00:03:18,410
That might be one way
of thinking about it.

95
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:20,090
Freedom to do evil,

96
00:03:20,091 --> 00:03:21,740
but an orientation towards the good.

97
00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:26,690
And so you participate in whatever that
transcendent element of you is while you

98
00:03:26,691 --> 00:03:29,720
try to speak the truth
and sort out the world.

99
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:31,220
It serves as a guide.

100
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:35,120
So I know that you're making a,

101
00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:36,523
uh,

102
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:41,930
a query about some transcendent reality
may be the transcendent reality of God,

103
00:03:42,410 --> 00:03:44,360
but that's the best answer
you're going to get out of me,

104
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:47,480
okay?

105
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:48,313
Yes.

106
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:54,831
Okay.

107
00:03:54,831 --> 00:03:55,551
Two questions.

108
00:03:55,551 --> 00:03:58,580
What's my opinion on the alt right
and what's my opinion on cultural

109
00:03:58,581 --> 00:03:59,414
appropriation?

110
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:02,540
The idea of cultural appropriation
is absolute nonsense.

111
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:08,490
That's that [inaudible]

112
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:10,390
no,

113
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:13,540
there's no difference between cultural
appropriation and learning from one

114
00:04:13,541 --> 00:04:14,374
another.

115
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:15,760
They're the same thing.

116
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:17,290
Now that doesn't mean I can't,

117
00:04:17,530 --> 00:04:21,070
that doesn't mean that there's
no theft between people.

118
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:22,413
There is,

119
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:22,901
you know,

120
00:04:22,901 --> 00:04:26,650
and it doesn't mean that just because
you encounter someone else's ideas,

121
00:04:26,651 --> 00:04:29,770
you have an immediate right to those
ideas as if they were your own.

122
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:34,870
But the idea that manifesting
in your own behavior,

123
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,250
some element of another culture,

124
00:04:36,251 --> 00:04:39,160
the idea that that's
somehow immoral is insane.

125
00:04:39,161 --> 00:04:41,770
It's actually one of the basis of peace.

126
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:42,220
You know,

127
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:46,360
one of the things that the various
groups of human beings that exist have to

128
00:04:46,361 --> 00:04:49,180
offer each other is the
tremendous value of their culture.

129
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:50,290
You know,

130
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:51,850
it's been really interesting to me,

131
00:04:51,851 --> 00:04:52,421
for example,

132
00:04:52,421 --> 00:04:56,800
to watch the responsive
of wall of everyone.

133
00:04:56,801 --> 00:04:58,430
But for this argument too,

134
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:00,490
for young Caucasian males to hip hop,

135
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:01,481
you know,

136
00:05:01,481 --> 00:05:04,630
there's an aggressiveness about hip
hop that's pretty attractive to young

137
00:05:04,631 --> 00:05:05,351
Caucasian males.

138
00:05:05,351 --> 00:05:06,700
And there's something absurd about,

139
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:07,960
about the,

140
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:08,830
the,

141
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:13,830
the spectacle of the young Caucasian
males taking on the persona of inner city

142
00:05:14,831 --> 00:05:16,210
black gang members,

143
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:17,343
you know,

144
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:17,920
but,

145
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:21,760
but I'm sympathetic to it because
there's an aggressiveness to that,

146
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:27,060
to that art form that's a necessary
corrective to the insistence that the

147
00:05:28,001 --> 00:05:31,270
highest moral virtue for a
modern man is harmlessness,

148
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:32,770
which is absurd.

149
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,930
Women don't even like cardless man,

150
00:05:34,931 --> 00:05:35,800
they hate them.

151
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:36,933
They liked that

152
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:39,083
park.

153
00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:42,030
Women

154
00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:47,030
want are dangerous men who are civilized
and they want to help civilize them.

155
00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:50,430
That's beauty and the beast.

156
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:51,361
So,

157
00:05:51,361 --> 00:05:51,661
you know,

158
00:05:51,661 --> 00:05:54,750
I'll tell you a funny story and only
engineers could have come up with this

159
00:05:54,751 --> 00:05:59,660
because they are the only ones that have
the unparalleled blindness to social

160
00:05:59,661 --> 00:06:01,790
convention that would
allow them to discover it.

161
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:03,620
So the Google engineers,

162
00:06:03,621 --> 00:06:04,880
I like engineers by the way,

163
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:06,110
cause they're very straightforward.

164
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:10,340
The Google engineers wrote a book awhile
back called a billion wicked thoughts,

165
00:06:10,341 --> 00:06:12,650
which was a study of Internet searches,

166
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:13,970
billions of them literally.

167
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:16,460
And they were looking a
lot at pornography use.

168
00:06:16,461 --> 00:06:19,100
And while there's lots of known
about male pornography use,

169
00:06:19,101 --> 00:06:20,840
partly and it's easy to understand,

170
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:25,870
I mean males are pretty visually oriented
and what attracts them to pornography

171
00:06:25,971 --> 00:06:27,580
is fairly straight forward.

172
00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:28,550
Um,

173
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:31,580
you can tell that if you look at
graffiti and a men's washroom,

174
00:06:31,581 --> 00:06:31,881
you know,

175
00:06:31,881 --> 00:06:36,590
it's like two circles and a triangle
and the men are absolutely transfixed.

176
00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:37,523
Bye

177
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:47,340
[inaudible].

178
00:06:49,730 --> 00:06:50,563
So

179
00:06:52,450 --> 00:06:53,040
for women,

180
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,380
his story is more complex.

181
00:06:54,381 --> 00:06:55,490
They use pornography too.

182
00:06:55,491 --> 00:06:58,730
But it tends to be literary because women
tend to like words more than they like

183
00:06:58,731 --> 00:06:59,600
visual stimuli.

184
00:06:59,601 --> 00:07:04,020
And so the Google guys tried to track
down the architectural structure of all,

185
00:07:04,021 --> 00:07:06,560
they didn't use those words
of female pornography use.

186
00:07:06,561 --> 00:07:11,420
And so some of you know how many of
you know what a Harlequin romance is.

187
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:12,650
Okay,

188
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:12,951
good.

189
00:07:12,951 --> 00:07:14,480
So those are archetypal stories,

190
00:07:14,481 --> 00:07:14,661
right?

191
00:07:14,661 --> 00:07:16,460
That's the taming of the wild man,

192
00:07:16,461 --> 00:07:17,420
essentially by the,

193
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,430
by the desirable in virgin a woman.

194
00:07:19,431 --> 00:07:21,680
And if you think women don't want that,

195
00:07:21,681 --> 00:07:25,520
then you better bloody well come up with
an explanation for 50 shades of grey,

196
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:26,661
right?

197
00:07:26,661 --> 00:07:27,494
Which is the most,

198
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:32,240
the most rapid selling novel in human
history and merged at exactly the same

199
00:07:32,241 --> 00:07:35,930
time that all of this noise about the
lack of the absence of gender roles is,

200
00:07:35,931 --> 00:07:36,950
is being produced.

201
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:37,221
You know,

202
00:07:37,221 --> 00:07:37,850
on mosques.

203
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:39,500
It's like perfect female fantasy.

204
00:07:39,501 --> 00:07:41,300
It's exactly Arkan typically correct.

205
00:07:41,301 --> 00:07:42,200
It's beauty and the beast.

206
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:46,820
So what the Google guys showed was
the structure of beauty and the beast,

207
00:07:46,821 --> 00:07:50,210
although they didn't use that as a
reference that the female pornographic

208
00:07:50,211 --> 00:07:52,250
fantasy was wild guy.

209
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:53,300
Um,

210
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:53,720
you know,

211
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:56,630
somewhat careless about the
wants and desires of others,

212
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,980
attractive to everyone.

213
00:07:57,981 --> 00:08:02,270
Therefore High Status Tamed by the Magic
of a single woman and brought into a

214
00:08:02,271 --> 00:08:03,350
relationship with her.

215
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:04,071
Okay,

216
00:08:04,071 --> 00:08:04,371
so,

217
00:08:04,371 --> 00:08:05,660
but here's the comical part.

218
00:08:05,661 --> 00:08:06,830
This just made me laugh,

219
00:08:06,831 --> 00:08:07,131
man.

220
00:08:07,131 --> 00:08:07,790
It was like,

221
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:12,790
why were the five categories
of most desirable male
entity used most broadly and

222
00:08:13,461 --> 00:08:14,600
female pornography?

223
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:15,470
Oh,

224
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:16,310
it's so embarrassing.

225
00:08:16,311 --> 00:08:16,581
Women,

226
00:08:16,581 --> 00:08:17,660
you have to cover your head.

227
00:08:17,661 --> 00:08:17,841
Well,

228
00:08:17,841 --> 00:08:20,450
I say this because vampire,

229
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:26,980
we're both billionaire surgeon and pirate.

230
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:37,843
All

231
00:08:41,430 --> 00:08:42,263
right.

232
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:44,370
Another question.
