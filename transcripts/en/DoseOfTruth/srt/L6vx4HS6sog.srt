1
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:09,500
Why are you now Francoise
seat orange asked,

2
00:00:09,501 --> 00:00:09,781
why are,

3
00:00:09,781 --> 00:00:10,021
you know,

4
00:00:10,021 --> 00:00:12,570
hiding the amount you
receive from Patriot?

5
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:17,370
I found it very motivating to see the
amount skyrocket and telled glad to be

6
00:00:17,371 --> 00:00:19,290
part of this as if you were an artist.

7
00:00:19,291 --> 00:00:22,380
I now feel more like I'm buying a
product and I find it less appealing.

8
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:22,981
Yeah.

9
00:00:22,981 --> 00:00:26,160
Well it's one of those things where I'm
kind of damned if I do and damned if I

10
00:00:26,161 --> 00:00:26,611
don't,

11
00:00:26,611 --> 00:00:27,300
you know,

12
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:29,370
and I don't know what's correct.

13
00:00:29,371 --> 00:00:31,410
I guess I probably got tired of,

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:32,610
um,

15
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:36,270
the sort of more left leaning,

16
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:41,040
let's say radical left leaning press
people jumping up and down on me every

17
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:44,610
chance they got because people
were donating money for,

18
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:47,610
for services that I s particularly rent,

19
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:48,061
you know,

20
00:00:48,061 --> 00:00:50,790
that I render essentially for free.

21
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:52,343
Um,

22
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:53,461
you know,

23
00:00:53,461 --> 00:00:53,730
I,

24
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:57,210
there must be 10 articles in the last
week following the Lindsay Shepherd

25
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:02,600
incident pointing out that I'm
somehow being manipulative and,

26
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:03,571
and,

27
00:01:03,571 --> 00:01:04,404
uh,

28
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:08,130
evil in a capitalist
sort of way for daring to

29
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:10,100
okay,

30
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:13,970
allow people to donate money
to help support what I'm doing.

31
00:01:13,971 --> 00:01:15,770
And it gets kind of tiring.

32
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:17,840
And so I dunno,

33
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:18,530
I just,

34
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:21,140
and I guess I also thought that
maybe there's a part of it.

35
00:01:21,141 --> 00:01:21,974
It's like,

36
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:23,241
well,

37
00:01:23,241 --> 00:01:25,100
I wouldn't exactly call it bragging,

38
00:01:25,101 --> 00:01:26,510
but because it's not,

39
00:01:26,511 --> 00:01:27,344
but

40
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:30,530
ah,

41
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:31,640
that spoke good enough.

42
00:01:31,641 --> 00:01:32,210
I mean,

43
00:01:32,210 --> 00:01:33,830
it was an appeal to privacy,

44
00:01:33,831 --> 00:01:34,341
I suppose,

45
00:01:34,341 --> 00:01:34,971
in part two.

46
00:01:34,971 --> 00:01:36,350
I Dunno if it's the right thing.

47
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:38,900
I could do a poll on Twitter and find out,

48
00:01:38,901 --> 00:01:40,580
I guess I did that first.

49
00:01:40,581 --> 00:01:41,690
Some other things this week.

50
00:01:41,691 --> 00:01:42,710
So anyways,

51
00:01:42,711 --> 00:01:43,190
that's,

52
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:44,240
that's the answer to that.
