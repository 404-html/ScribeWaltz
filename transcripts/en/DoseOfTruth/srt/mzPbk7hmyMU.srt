1
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:09,930
Do what is meaningful,
not what is expedient.

2
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:14,880
And when you do what is meaningful,
you stay in the kingdom that you've

3
00:00:14,881 --> 00:00:18,450
established,
but you don't stay completely in it

4
00:00:18,451 --> 00:00:21,720
because you need to challenge yourself
and grow.

5
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:26,960
And so you put one foot tentatively out
into the domain that supersedes your

6
00:00:28,891 --> 00:00:33,330
competence and you maintain stability
and grow at the same time.

7
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:38,720
And when you're doing that properly,
then the f psychological consequences of

8
00:00:40,531 --> 00:00:44,790
that is the immersement in a meaningful
experience.

9
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,570
It's a deep instinct.
So when you know,

10
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:49,950
if you watch yourself,
you say,

11
00:00:49,951 --> 00:00:51,840
well,
I had a particularly good day at work

12
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:54,300
and what does that mean?
Well,

13
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:57,840
it means that you lost your sense of
time,

14
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:00,210
right?
Because when you're having not a good

15
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:03,840
day at work,
it's like first it's one minute to three

16
00:01:03,841 --> 00:01:04,674
and then it's

17
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:09,270
45 seconds to three,
and then it's 30 seconds.

18
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:11,460
That's what school was like for me.
It was like

19
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:16,350
click.
So funny.

20
00:01:16,351 --> 00:01:17,580
You know,
I went to,

21
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:22,140
I went to my daughter's school,
I used to get in trouble for talking all

22
00:01:22,141 --> 00:01:23,100
the time.
Surprise,

23
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:28,170
surprise when I was a kid and uh,
and I was bored stiff in school and so I

24
00:01:30,001 --> 00:01:33,630
would misbehave upon occasion out of
pure boredom.

25
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:39,260
And about 21 years ago,
I went to my daughter's school to sit

26
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:46,360
for a class.
It was about an hour long and uh,

27
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:50,940
I was sitting there and the teacher had
all the kids on the floor and was having

28
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,720
some of the kids read to the others and
some of the kids who were reading

29
00:01:54,721 --> 00:01:59,460
couldn't read at all.
And I had exactly the same experience.

30
00:01:59,461 --> 00:02:00,840
I was sitting there,
it was like being,

31
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,810
it's like being seven years old again
and I could see the clock going,

32
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:07,790
tick,
tick.

33
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:09,020
And I thought,
you know,

34
00:02:09,021 --> 00:02:10,670
if I was in this classroom for three
days,

35
00:02:10,671 --> 00:02:13,820
I would misbehave,
fit 40 years old,

36
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I would miss behave exactly like I did
when I was when I was six.

37
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,700
No,
well that's no place to be right because

38
00:02:22,701 --> 00:02:24,830
that's,
you don't want to be in a place that

39
00:02:24,831 --> 00:02:27,290
stultifying you don't want to be in a
place where there's no challenge.

40
00:02:27,291 --> 00:02:29,390
You might even quit your job if there's
no challenge.

41
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:30,890
Say,
well that's a good job.

42
00:02:30,891 --> 00:02:32,510
It gives you security and you think,
God,

43
00:02:32,511 --> 00:02:34,640
I can't stand this.
It's eating away at my soul.

44
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:38,270
It's all security and no challenge.
So why do you want a challenge?

45
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:42,260
Cause that's what you're built for.
That's what you're built for.

46
00:02:42,261 --> 00:02:45,380
Your built to take on a maximal load,
right?

47
00:02:45,381 --> 00:02:48,410
Cause that's what strengthens you.
And you need to be strong because life

48
00:02:48,411 --> 00:02:49,790
is extraordinarily difficult.

49
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:53,570
And because the evil king is always
whittling away at the structure of the

50
00:02:53,571 --> 00:02:57,560
state and you have to be awake and sharp
to stop that from happening so that you

51
00:02:57,561 --> 00:03:01,060
don't become corrupt and so that your
family doesn't become corrupt.

52
00:03:01,061 --> 00:03:04,330
And so that your state doesn't have to
be come become corrupt.

53
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:08,020
You have to have your eyes open and your
which sharp and your words at the ready.

54
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:11,290
And you have to be educated and you have
to know about your history.

55
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,030
And you know how have to know how to
think.

56
00:03:13,031 --> 00:03:15,730
And you have to know how to read and you
have to know how to speak.

57
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:19,210
And you have to know how to aim.
And you have to be willing to hoist the

58
00:03:19,211 --> 00:03:21,190
troubles of the world up on your
shoulders.

59
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:24,400
And what's so interesting about that,
so remarkable,

60
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:28,210
and this is something that's really
manifested itself to me as I've been

61
00:03:28,211 --> 00:03:29,380
doing these public lectures.

62
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:31,600
I've been talking about responsibility
to people,

63
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:34,030
which doesn't seem to happen very often
anymore,

64
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:38,770
and the audiences are dead quiet.
And I lay out this idea that life is

65
00:03:38,771 --> 00:03:41,830
tragedy tainted by malevolence and
everyone says,

66
00:03:41,831 --> 00:03:44,050
yeah,
well we already always suspected that,

67
00:03:44,051 --> 00:03:46,030
but no one has ever said it quite so
bluntly,

68
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:50,200
and it's quite a relief to hear that I'm
not the only person who has those

69
00:03:50,201 --> 00:03:53,200
suspicions.
And then the second part of that is the

70
00:03:53,201 --> 00:03:55,210
better part,
and it's the optimistic part,

71
00:03:55,211 --> 00:04:00,211
which is despite the fact that life is a
tragedy tainted by malevolence at every

72
00:04:02,111 --> 00:04:05,230
level of existence,
there's something about the human spirit

73
00:04:05,231 --> 00:04:10,231
that can thrive under precisely those
conditions if we allow that to occur.

74
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:15,100
Because as difficult as life is and as
horrible as we are,

75
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:20,520
our capacity to deal with that
catastrophe and to transcend that

76
00:04:20,621 --> 00:04:23,500
malevolent spirit is more powerful than
the,

77
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:25,030
than that reality itself.

78
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:30,070
And that's the fundamental issue.
I think that's the fundamental issue of

79
00:04:30,071 --> 00:04:33,700
the Judaeo Christian ethic with its
emphasis on the divinity of the

80
00:04:33,701 --> 00:04:37,390
individual.
As catastrophic as life is and as

81
00:04:37,391 --> 00:04:42,391
malevolent as people can be.
And that's malevolent beyond belief.

82
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:47,940
Fundamentally,
a person has in spirit the nobility to

83
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:53,460
set that right and to defeat evil and
that and that more than that and that

84
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:58,300
the antidote to the catastrophe of life
and the suffering of life and the

85
00:04:58,301 --> 00:05:01,660
tragedy of life that can drive you down
and destroy you,

86
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:05,440
is to take on exactly that
responsibility and to say,

87
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,140
well,
there's plenty of work to be done and

88
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:13,090
isn't that terrible and there isn't
anything so bad that we can't make it

89
00:05:13,091 --> 00:05:15,970
worse and certainly try very hard to do
so.

90
00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:20,950
But I have it within me to decide that
I'm going to stand up against that.

91
00:05:20,951 --> 00:05:23,020
I'm going to strive to make the world a
better place.

92
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:27,070
I'm going to strive to constrain the
malevolence that's in my own heart and

93
00:05:27,071 --> 00:05:32,071
to set my family's straight and to work,
to work despite my tragic lot for the

94
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:36,070
betterment of anything,
of everything that's in front of me.

95
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:40,180
And the consequence of that,
the immediate consequence of that is

96
00:05:40,181 --> 00:05:44,770
that when you make the decision to take
on all of that voluntarily,

97
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:47,140
which is to stand up straight,
by the way,

98
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:49,440
with your shoulders back,
to take on that,

99
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:53,230
all that on voluntarily,
as soon as you make that decision,

100
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:58,310
then all the catastrophe justifies
itself in the nobility of your striving.

101
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:02,420
And that's what it means to be an
individual.

102
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:04,263
Thank you.

103
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:10,220
[inaudible].
