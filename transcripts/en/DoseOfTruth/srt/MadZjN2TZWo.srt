1
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:08,520
The one in the last,

2
00:00:08,521 --> 00:00:09,430
which is on the right.

3
00:00:09,470 --> 00:00:10,640
It's quite a horrifying image.

4
00:00:10,641 --> 00:00:10,891
She know.

5
00:00:10,891 --> 00:00:13,110
And that's a kind of a
devouring father figure.

6
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:14,430
And you know,

7
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:14,890
here,

8
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:15,480
here's a,

9
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:16,830
here's a way of thinking about that I,

10
00:00:16,831 --> 00:00:18,270
which I think is extremely useful.

11
00:00:18,271 --> 00:00:18,571
So you,

12
00:00:18,571 --> 00:00:18,751
here,

13
00:00:18,751 --> 00:00:20,010
you guys are in university,

14
00:00:20,011 --> 00:00:20,580
you know,

15
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:21,413
and so,

16
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:22,313
um,

17
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:27,810
university is one of those patriarchal
institution that's gives with one hand

18
00:00:27,811 --> 00:00:28,950
and takes away with another,

19
00:00:28,951 --> 00:00:29,221
right?

20
00:00:29,221 --> 00:00:30,360
So when you come here,

21
00:00:30,361 --> 00:00:31,320
there's thousands of you,

22
00:00:31,321 --> 00:00:32,640
there's tens of thousands of view.

23
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:37,110
So in some sense as an individual you're
rather faceless and you're also in some

24
00:00:37,111 --> 00:00:39,810
sense at the bottom of the power
hierarchy in the university,

25
00:00:39,811 --> 00:00:40,980
I think more than you should be.

26
00:00:40,981 --> 00:00:41,820
But whatever you,

27
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,170
you are at the bottom of it.

28
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:44,243
And so there's,

29
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:48,120
there's a crushing institutional weight
that comes along with being part of such

30
00:00:48,121 --> 00:00:49,680
a big university in particular.

31
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:50,190
You know,

32
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:52,620
that's really hard on
students in their first year.

33
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:53,251
You know,

34
00:00:53,251 --> 00:00:56,400
it's always seemed to me that it's
better for first year students to go to a

35
00:00:56,401 --> 00:01:00,180
smaller place where the
institutional weight is not so heavy.

36
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:01,141
And you know,

37
00:01:01,141 --> 00:01:04,800
I've tested u of t students in their
first year with things like the Beck

38
00:01:04,801 --> 00:01:09,801
depression inventory and about 30%
of u of t students meet criteria for

39
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:11,400
hospitalized depression.

40
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:12,570
They do,

41
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:12,841
you know,

42
00:01:12,841 --> 00:01:13,110
but,

43
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:16,470
but that's also because the back is way
more sensitive to that than it should

44
00:01:16,471 --> 00:01:16,710
be.

45
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:17,543
At least that,

46
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:18,030
you know,

47
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:21,510
because I don't think its criteria for
when you should be hospitalized are

48
00:01:21,511 --> 00:01:22,021
reasonable.

49
00:01:22,021 --> 00:01:25,620
But the point is is that the depression
and the anxiety is quite high.

50
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:26,221
And so,

51
00:01:26,221 --> 00:01:27,031
but on the other hand,

52
00:01:27,031 --> 00:01:29,250
of course you're benefiting
from going to university.

53
00:01:29,251 --> 00:01:32,370
And so that's the kind of
bipolar nature of the symbol.

54
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:33,450
It's the tire town,

55
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:34,980
it's benevolent tradition.

56
00:01:34,981 --> 00:01:35,910
At the same time,

57
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:36,690
you know,

58
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:37,800
it's molding you.

59
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:41,430
You could even say it's crushing you
because an educational system does that.

60
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:43,170
But at the same time it's like,

61
00:01:43,171 --> 00:01:43,740
well,

62
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:45,720
unless you allow yourself
to get crushed by it,

63
00:01:45,721 --> 00:01:47,700
you're not going to get the benefit.

64
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:51,420
And that's the paradoxical relationship
that individuals have with culture

65
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:52,171
everywhere.

66
00:01:52,171 --> 00:01:53,430
And at all time.

67
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:54,270
You know,

68
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:55,620
without culture you're nothing.

69
00:01:55,621 --> 00:01:56,610
But with culture,

70
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:58,890
you have to be a cog in some sense.

71
00:01:58,891 --> 00:02:02,940
And so the tension between those two
things is continual and constant.

72
00:02:02,941 --> 00:02:05,460
You could think about it
as an existential constant.

73
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:08,580
Ever since there's been
complex human societies,

74
00:02:08,730 --> 00:02:11,670
and maybe even when there were
only tribal human societies,

75
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:14,070
that's been a problem for the individual.

76
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:15,120
So culture,

77
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:15,871
tradition,

78
00:02:15,871 --> 00:02:19,500
the dominance hierarchy is a
solution and a problem and nature,

79
00:02:19,501 --> 00:02:20,191
the unknown,

80
00:02:20,191 --> 00:02:23,820
unexplored territory is
a solution and a problem.

81
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:25,410
And then the third category,

82
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:26,011
while you see,

83
00:02:26,011 --> 00:02:28,020
I'll just tell you a couple
of things about these images.

84
00:02:28,021 --> 00:02:28,860
So the one in the right,

85
00:02:28,861 --> 00:02:30,750
that's the devouring father,

86
00:02:30,751 --> 00:02:32,220
that's also giving birth.

87
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:33,480
So in some sense,

88
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:36,210
your personalities are being
devoured by the university,

89
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:37,410
but at the same time,

90
00:02:37,411 --> 00:02:40,920
a new personalities coming
emerging as a consequence of that.

91
00:02:40,921 --> 00:02:43,440
And hopefully it's a better
personality than the previous one.

92
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:46,830
If you can tolerate the
tension of being transformed,

93
00:02:46,831 --> 00:02:47,880
the heat and the pressure,

94
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:49,170
then hopefully you come out,

95
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:50,070
you know,

96
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:51,390
you come out though,

97
00:02:51,391 --> 00:02:52,111
it's worth it.

98
00:02:52,111 --> 00:02:53,370
The process is worth it.
