1
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:07,940
So anyway,

2
00:00:07,941 --> 00:00:11,080
so there's Horace and then
there's the guy on the,

3
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:15,670
on the right there is set and he's
like the precursor of the Christian

4
00:00:15,671 --> 00:00:17,050
representation of Satan.

5
00:00:17,051 --> 00:00:17,531
In fact,

6
00:00:17,531 --> 00:00:22,531
the named Satan seems to have been at
transformation of the name sat and Psat is

7
00:00:22,661 --> 00:00:23,494
actually,

8
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:28,500
he's like the God of
totalitarian possibility
because in Egypt in mythology he

9
00:00:28,931 --> 00:00:30,430
represents the brother,

10
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:34,780
the evil brother of the rightful king
who's always plotting to overthrow the

11
00:00:34,781 --> 00:00:35,614
rightful king.

12
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:37,660
And Horace is his natural enemy.

13
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:38,761
And what this means,

14
00:00:38,761 --> 00:00:39,491
I tell you man,

15
00:00:39,491 --> 00:00:40,570
it's really important.

16
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:44,770
So I have in my clinical
practice frequently people
who are stuck in the middle

17
00:00:44,771 --> 00:00:46,720
of absolutely moronic bureaucracy.

18
00:00:46,721 --> 00:00:48,610
So I can give you an example of this.

19
00:00:48,611 --> 00:00:49,540
I just love this.

20
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:52,450
One of my clients who worked
for a large corporation,

21
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:53,920
who's pretty sensible woman,

22
00:00:53,921 --> 00:00:57,580
she's being driven mad by the political
correctness that didn't detected the

23
00:00:57,581 --> 00:00:58,350
organization.

24
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:03,350
And she sent me at 32 32 email letter
exchanges that were circulating around the

25
00:01:06,941 --> 00:01:07,930
word flip chart.

26
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:10,900
I don't know if any of you have heard
the flip chart conver controversy,

27
00:01:10,901 --> 00:01:13,420
but it's Kurt pretty
mind bogglingly moronic.

28
00:01:13,421 --> 00:01:13,990
And,

29
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:16,870
and so the deal was that somebody,

30
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:17,950
you know what a flip chart is,

31
00:01:17,951 --> 00:01:18,161
right?

32
00:01:18,161 --> 00:01:21,370
It's one of those paper pads
that you flip the paper over.

33
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:26,170
Well it turns out hypothetically that
flip is a pejorative term for Filipinos.

34
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:28,630
And so they believe that the idea,

35
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:33,310
the flip chart phrase was no longer
acceptable because it was potentially

36
00:01:33,311 --> 00:01:34,540
offensive to was,

37
00:01:34,570 --> 00:01:38,110
although I bet they would have had to
like vacuum up the whole planet to find

38
00:01:38,111 --> 00:01:42,130
one Filipino who actually cared whether
or not someone called that a flip chart,

39
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:42,821
you know?

40
00:01:42,821 --> 00:01:45,910
And that person would have had plenty
of problems that were worse than that.

41
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:46,571
Anyway,

42
00:01:46,571 --> 00:01:51,571
there was like a 32 serious email
exchanges about what terminology should be

43
00:01:52,211 --> 00:01:54,190
used instead of flip chart,

44
00:01:54,191 --> 00:01:54,460
you know.

45
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:57,730
So that's what people were doing instead
of trying to actually have a life and

46
00:01:57,731 --> 00:02:00,850
do something useful and it was
driving her completely mad.

47
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:02,800
They did rename them and made it,

48
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:03,873
um,

49
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:08,470
it made part of corporate policy that it
was inappropriate to use the word flip

50
00:02:08,471 --> 00:02:08,741
chart.

51
00:02:08,741 --> 00:02:10,420
I don't remember what the
hell they called them.

52
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:11,643
Who knows?

53
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:12,933
But,

54
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:16,150
but the reason I'm telling you this
story is lot of you are going to find

55
00:02:16,151 --> 00:02:19,690
yourself embedded in
bureaucracies and you know,

56
00:02:19,691 --> 00:02:21,160
and there's that for better or for worse.

57
00:02:21,161 --> 00:02:22,330
And one of the things that are going to,

58
00:02:22,331 --> 00:02:26,230
is going to happen to you is that people
are going to ask you to do stupid and

59
00:02:26,231 --> 00:02:27,430
ridiculous things.

60
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:31,300
And the fact that they're asking you
to do stupid and ridiculous things,

61
00:02:31,301 --> 00:02:32,440
it's going to do two things,

62
00:02:32,441 --> 00:02:33,340
three things to you.

63
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:37,300
One is it a warp you so that you'll
pretend that you agree with it and then

64
00:02:37,301 --> 00:02:38,350
eventually you will,

65
00:02:38,351 --> 00:02:40,960
and like good so much for your soul.

66
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,760
And then the other thing is,

67
00:02:42,761 --> 00:02:44,950
is that it will demotivate
you because you'll think,

68
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:50,050
why should I be like slaving away at this
job when you know I'm being pecked to

69
00:02:50,051 --> 00:02:52,360
death by morons with stupid rules.

70
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:54,070
And um,

71
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:57,750
the third thing that it will do is
make you resentful and irritated,

72
00:02:57,751 --> 00:03:01,720
and then that will also undermine
motivation and make your life miserable.

73
00:03:01,721 --> 00:03:02,590
And so you might think,

74
00:03:02,591 --> 00:03:02,980
well,

75
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:04,840
what should you do about that?

76
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:09,960
And the answer to that is you should
object at the earliest possible point

77
00:03:10,751 --> 00:03:11,650
because first of all,

78
00:03:11,651 --> 00:03:12,970
you'll find that if you do,

79
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:15,610
if you object to radical stupidity,

80
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:16,960
when it first emerges,

81
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:20,230
you kind of make people aware of the
fact that what they're doing is radically

82
00:03:20,231 --> 00:03:22,630
stupid and they'll usually back off.

83
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:25,060
And so then they won't
torture you to death.

84
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:26,160
So,

85
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:26,380
you know,

86
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:27,640
you have to take a risk,

87
00:03:27,641 --> 00:03:27,971
which is,

88
00:03:27,971 --> 00:03:28,391
oh no,

89
00:03:28,391 --> 00:03:30,070
what happens if I complain about this?

90
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:30,970
But you know,

91
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:33,910
it's another one of those situations
where you're damned if you do and you're

92
00:03:33,911 --> 00:03:34,870
damned if you don't.

93
00:03:34,871 --> 00:03:35,890
So if you complain,

94
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:37,330
that'll cause some trouble.

95
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:41,320
Although usually it causes
way less trouble than you'd
think because people are

96
00:03:41,321 --> 00:03:43,000
generally not very courageous.

97
00:03:43,001 --> 00:03:45,660
And if you push them
with some strength on a,

98
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:47,830
when they're doing something
absolutely moronic,

99
00:03:47,831 --> 00:03:50,470
they'll usually back off because they
don't know what to do when they're being

100
00:03:50,471 --> 00:03:51,304
challenged.

101
00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:54,010
And then you won't have to put up
with it for the rest of your life.

102
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:58,570
And so why I'm telling you this is
because all sorts of bureaucratic,

103
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:00,023
uh,

104
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:00,903
entities,

105
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:02,320
corporations,

106
00:04:02,321 --> 00:04:03,760
government institutions,

107
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:04,833
um,

108
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:06,910
nonprofit organizations,

109
00:04:06,911 --> 00:04:09,040
anything that's above a certain size,

110
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:10,960
cause it doesn't matter if
it's government or corporate,

111
00:04:10,961 --> 00:04:12,370
it's all the same bloody foolishness.

112
00:04:12,371 --> 00:04:13,330
When it gets too big,

113
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:17,290
it's like those things can
towards totalitarian structures.

114
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,393
It's part of,

115
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:19,390
it's part of their,

116
00:04:19,391 --> 00:04:22,510
the innate danger that's associated
with social organization.

117
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,620
And so then you might say,

118
00:04:23,621 --> 00:04:28,621
well how do you keep the enterprise that
you're part of alive and dynamic and

119
00:04:29,201 --> 00:04:32,200
also keep it a place that a
sensible person who's got,

120
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:35,680
who's got a proper orientation
could stand to work.

121
00:04:35,681 --> 00:04:38,140
And the answer is do not do things.

122
00:04:38,141 --> 00:04:38,531
You know,

123
00:04:38,531 --> 00:04:39,460
to be stupid.

124
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:40,990
Stand up and say,

125
00:04:40,991 --> 00:04:41,291
look,

126
00:04:41,291 --> 00:04:41,831
that's dumb.

127
00:04:41,831 --> 00:04:42,581
I'm not doing it.

128
00:04:42,581 --> 00:04:43,630
And if they ask you why,

129
00:04:43,631 --> 00:04:44,464
then you can say,

130
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:44,890
well,

131
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:45,161
hey,

132
00:04:45,161 --> 00:04:46,780
I think it's stupid B,

133
00:04:46,781 --> 00:04:47,381
if I do it,

134
00:04:47,381 --> 00:04:49,180
I'm going to get irritated and resentful.

135
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,410
And also if I do it,

136
00:04:50,411 --> 00:04:53,290
it's going to decrease my
motivation so I'm not doing it.

137
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:54,940
And then if they push you too hard,

138
00:04:54,941 --> 00:04:55,450
it's like,

139
00:04:55,450 --> 00:04:56,050
hey,

140
00:04:56,050 --> 00:04:57,820
it's time for a different job.

141
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:00,790
And that might be the best thing that
ever happened to you because if the,

142
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:05,260
the structure you're in is going in
that direction and you can't stop it,

143
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:07,900
it's like get the hell out of
there and find something else.

144
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:11,590
So it's not that hard to find a
job when you already have a job.

145
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:13,780
Now it's another thing
to keep in mind too,

146
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:14,321
you know,

147
00:05:14,321 --> 00:05:16,270
when ever you're working and you will be,

148
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:20,770
especially in the world that the world
of today where jobs are relatively

149
00:05:20,771 --> 00:05:25,360
uncertain is you should always have
an escape route plant and it should be

150
00:05:25,361 --> 00:05:29,890
active because if you don't have an
escape route and you can't get away,

151
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:31,330
you can't say no.

152
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:32,980
And if you can't say no,

153
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:34,120
you can't bargain.

154
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,560
And if you can't bargain,

155
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:36,700
you're a slave.

156
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,500
So those,

157
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:39,190
that's how it,

158
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:41,630
that's how the world is
set out at the moment.

159
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:42,820
Probably always been like that.

160
00:05:42,821 --> 00:05:46,090
But it's something that you really
need to know cause you got to watch if

161
00:05:46,091 --> 00:05:46,540
you're,

162
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:51,520
if you're being is objecting to someone
to something that someone is forcing you

163
00:05:51,521 --> 00:05:52,354
to do,

164
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,040
maybe you're right,

165
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,170
maybe you shouldn't be doing it.

166
00:05:56,470 --> 00:06:00,220
And lots of people end up living
meaningless lives and that that's,

167
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:03,860
that's not a very good term
because there's no such
thing as a meaningless life

168
00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:09,170
because one of the meanings of life
is suffering and there's no bloody way

169
00:06:09,171 --> 00:06:10,160
you're going to escape that.

170
00:06:10,161 --> 00:06:12,140
So you will not have a meaningless life.

171
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:14,690
You'll have a life that's only suffering.

172
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:19,430
And I wouldn't recommend that because
it'll make you one miserable creature and

173
00:06:19,431 --> 00:06:22,430
plus you warp everyone around
you because you'll be vengeful.

174
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:23,441
So it,

175
00:06:23,441 --> 00:06:24,860
these things are really important.

176
00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:25,940
They're really important.
