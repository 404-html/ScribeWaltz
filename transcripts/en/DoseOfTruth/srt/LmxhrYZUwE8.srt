1
00:00:07,610 --> 00:00:09,080
One of the things that I've thought

2
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:11,623
a bit of a tangent,

3
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:14,450
but I'll move back to
the mortal afterwards.

4
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:16,130
See,

5
00:00:16,130 --> 00:00:20,270
I really liked the psycho analyst and
I liked the idea that you have a psyche

6
00:00:20,271 --> 00:00:24,200
that's inside of you and that that is
structured in partly consciously and in

7
00:00:24,201 --> 00:00:25,700
part conch unconsciously.

8
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:29,300
There's something about that that's really
cool and I've learned a lot from the

9
00:00:29,301 --> 00:00:30,230
psychoanalyst,

10
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:31,131
but you know,

11
00:00:31,131 --> 00:00:36,131
there is a funny consequence of thinking
the way they think and you do think the

12
00:00:36,261 --> 00:00:36,891
way they think,

13
00:00:36,891 --> 00:00:37,880
even if you don't know it.

14
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:41,480
Like we tend to think that a
lot of us is inside our head.

15
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:42,350
You know,

16
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:44,330
that's the psyche model basically.

17
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:47,690
But the more I've practiced
as a clinical psychologist,

18
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:48,171
the last,

19
00:00:48,171 --> 00:00:50,150
I've actually been
convinced that that's true.

20
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:51,711
So I could say,

21
00:00:51,711 --> 00:00:52,040
well,

22
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:54,530
let's say I want to know
about your personality.

23
00:00:55,070 --> 00:00:55,431
We think,

24
00:00:55,431 --> 00:00:55,551
well,

25
00:00:55,551 --> 00:00:56,420
I want to know you.

26
00:00:56,421 --> 00:00:58,910
I want to know about your subjectivity.

27
00:00:58,911 --> 00:01:00,380
I didn't want to know
what's inside of you.

28
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:01,970
But that isn't actually what you do.

29
00:01:01,971 --> 00:01:02,591
Want to know if,

30
00:01:02,591 --> 00:01:02,840
if,

31
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:04,010
if you're doing clinical work,

32
00:01:04,011 --> 00:01:06,140
say with someone you want to know,

33
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:08,660
did they have any friends?

34
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:14,210
That's really important because if you're
miserable and anxious and badly placed

35
00:01:14,211 --> 00:01:16,250
in life and misbehaving,

36
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:20,060
one of the reasons that all of that
can occur is because you don't have any

37
00:01:20,061 --> 00:01:20,361
friends.

38
00:01:20,361 --> 00:01:21,194
You don't know anyone,

39
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:23,690
and that's not something
that's inside you.

40
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:24,800
It's,

41
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:28,580
it's you localized in a broader sphere.

42
00:01:28,581 --> 00:01:29,331
And then you might say,

43
00:01:29,331 --> 00:01:29,571
well,

44
00:01:29,571 --> 00:01:31,850
do you have a job and well,

45
00:01:31,851 --> 00:01:32,840
let's talk about the job.

46
00:01:32,841 --> 00:01:34,700
Do you actually make
enough money with your job?

47
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:37,070
Is it satisfying for you in any way?

48
00:01:37,071 --> 00:01:38,390
Are you bullied all the time?

49
00:01:38,391 --> 00:01:39,224
When you're at work?

50
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:40,670
Does it provoke anxiety?

51
00:01:40,970 --> 00:01:43,460
Is it a career that allows
you to go somewhere?

52
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:44,750
Are you overwork?

53
00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:45,470
Well,

54
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:47,270
but let's start with
just the first question.

55
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:48,770
Do you have a job?

56
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:49,131
Well,

57
00:01:49,131 --> 00:01:50,750
if the answer to that is no,

58
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:54,020
you have a serious problem
and that would enough.

59
00:01:54,050 --> 00:01:57,860
Might be too depressed you and make you
anxious and hopeless and nihilistic and

60
00:01:57,861 --> 00:01:58,694
all of those things.

61
00:01:58,970 --> 00:01:59,751
And you could say,

62
00:01:59,751 --> 00:01:59,961
well,

63
00:01:59,961 --> 00:02:02,660
you're not reacting very
well to not having a job,

64
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,970
but that's kind of a foolish objection.

65
00:02:04,971 --> 00:02:06,530
Even though some of it might be true.

66
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:07,660
One problem is,

67
00:02:07,661 --> 00:02:10,220
is that you're not reacting
very well to not having a job.

68
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:14,060
But another problem is that you don't
have a job and that actually constitutes a

69
00:02:14,061 --> 00:02:14,894
problem,

70
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:15,440
right?

71
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,460
You don't get to eat.

72
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,900
You don't have a place to live.

73
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:20,060
So those aren't psychological problems.

74
00:02:20,061 --> 00:02:20,601
Precisely,

75
00:02:20,601 --> 00:02:23,450
even though a psychological
problem could make it worse.

76
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:24,620
Well,

77
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:26,540
are you as educated as you should be?

78
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:27,710
That's another question.

79
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:29,540
How do you handle drugs and alcohol?

80
00:02:29,541 --> 00:02:31,370
Are they taking you down a bad pathway?

81
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:32,533
You know?

82
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:33,463
Um,

83
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:36,680
what about intimate
relationships be have one,

84
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:38,380
you have a plan for one or they,

85
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:41,690
is that a never ending series of
catastrophes or something that you avoid

86
00:02:41,691 --> 00:02:42,524
completely.

87
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,670
That's a big problem.

88
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:45,200
And maybe people don't,

89
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,480
aren't attracted to you
for one reason or another.

90
00:02:47,481 --> 00:02:49,850
And you could think about that
as a psychological problem,

91
00:02:49,851 --> 00:02:51,980
but it's an interpersonal problem.

92
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:55,490
And the degree to which that's
a psychological problem is,

93
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:58,250
is certainly an unspecified.

94
00:02:58,251 --> 00:02:59,770
When you first begin talk to somebody,

95
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:01,000
what about your family?

96
00:03:01,001 --> 00:03:02,020
Do you have a family?

97
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:04,780
Cause it's hard to be in
the world all by yourself.

98
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:05,650
That's for sure.

99
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:07,570
It makes things a lot more stressful.

100
00:03:07,571 --> 00:03:10,840
Even though having a family can
also be extraordinarily stressful.

101
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:11,740
You don't,

102
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:13,360
do you have plans to have children?

103
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:14,860
How are you doing with your parents?

104
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:16,600
Do you get along with your siblings?

105
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:17,261
You know,

106
00:03:17,261 --> 00:03:18,010
all of that.

107
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:20,500
All of that to me is more fundamental.

108
00:03:20,501 --> 00:03:21,670
And it's outside of you.

109
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Those are elements of your experience
more broadly conceptualized more than they

110
00:03:27,251 --> 00:03:31,030
are objects of your psychology
or of your internal experience.

111
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:31,891
You know,

112
00:03:31,891 --> 00:03:32,724
it's sort of like

113
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:37,521
while a person is,

114
00:03:37,521 --> 00:03:38,110
uh,

115
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:41,450
is it is a creature that exists
at multiple levels of analysis,

116
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:42,770
right?

117
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:45,350
Something might go wrong
with you at a cellular level,

118
00:03:45,351 --> 00:03:47,750
so maybe you're born with
a genetic abnormality,

119
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:50,060
so something's wrong with you molecularly,

120
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:52,670
or you have something
wrong with a major Oregon.

121
00:03:53,210 --> 00:03:55,370
Or maybe there's something
wrong with you psychologically.

122
00:03:55,371 --> 00:03:59,720
Or maybe you're in a pathological family
or maybe you're stuck in a pathological

123
00:03:59,721 --> 00:04:04,721
social system and and figuring out what's
why you're suffering means going up

124
00:04:06,051 --> 00:04:07,250
and down those different levels.

125
00:04:07,251 --> 00:04:11,180
Trying to specify the appropriate level
for analysis and also the appropriate

126
00:04:11,181 --> 00:04:12,260
level for intervention.

127
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:13,880
And for me as a,

128
00:04:13,881 --> 00:04:14,481
as I've said,

129
00:04:14,481 --> 00:04:17,990
even though I'm a great admirer of the
psychoanalysts and I do things like dream

130
00:04:17,991 --> 00:04:18,471
analysis,

131
00:04:18,471 --> 00:04:23,270
which I really find you an incredibly
useful and enlightening the first,

132
00:04:23,271 --> 00:04:24,890
the fundamental level of analysis is,

133
00:04:24,891 --> 00:04:25,041
well,

134
00:04:25,041 --> 00:04:26,750
what's your experience structured like?

135
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:27,973
Exactly.

136
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:29,750
And that isn't localized in you.

137
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:33,830
Now the behaviorists do that too because
what's one of the things I really liked

138
00:04:33,831 --> 00:04:35,690
about the behavioral
approach to psychotherapy,

139
00:04:35,691 --> 00:04:36,111
it's very,

140
00:04:36,111 --> 00:04:37,400
very concrete and practical.

141
00:04:37,401 --> 00:04:38,720
It's like they'll say,

142
00:04:38,721 --> 00:04:39,554
well,

143
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:43,070
there's certain things that you need to
have in order to live properly and maybe

144
00:04:43,071 --> 00:04:46,760
you don't have the skills or
the wherewithal wherewithal
to accumulate them and

145
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:49,550
we'll break them down into tiny
little pieces and you'll practice.

146
00:04:49,551 --> 00:04:49,731
So,

147
00:04:49,731 --> 00:04:50,564
for example,

148
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,430
with someone who doesn't have any friends,

149
00:04:52,431 --> 00:04:57,431
then you do a micro analysis of their
social skills saying maybe an analysis of

150
00:04:57,681 --> 00:05:01,550
the kinds of anxiety that are stopping
them from going out and meeting people

151
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:05,120
and then you address those
things practically one by
one you tried to get the

152
00:05:05,121 --> 00:05:06,230
person to have some friends.

153
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:09,650
He tried to figure out how they can
establish an intimate relationship.

154
00:05:09,651 --> 00:05:12,080
You see if you can help
them sort out their family,

155
00:05:12,081 --> 00:05:14,000
you do what you can
about their employment.

156
00:05:14,001 --> 00:05:18,320
And a lot of that's only tangentially
related to really in some sense to the

157
00:05:18,321 --> 00:05:19,490
structure of their psyche.

158
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:24,380
But one of the things you'll see if you
work as a clinician or as a counselor is

159
00:05:24,381 --> 00:05:27,410
that most of the time people come and
see you because they have problems,

160
00:05:27,411 --> 00:05:29,270
not because they have
psychological problems.

161
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:32,480
And those things are not
that easy to distinguish.

162
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:33,171
You know,

163
00:05:33,171 --> 00:05:34,820
it's sort of the psychoanalytic idea,

164
00:05:34,821 --> 00:05:35,271
sort of like,

165
00:05:35,271 --> 00:05:36,860
well if you just start your act together,

166
00:05:36,861 --> 00:05:38,270
everything would work out for you.

167
00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:39,230
It's like,

168
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:40,063
yeah,

169
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,420
there's some truth in that,

170
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,153
but,

171
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:49,601
but you know,

172
00:05:49,601 --> 00:05:52,450
if you're 55 years old and
you've just been laid off work

173
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,930
and maybe through no fault of your own,

174
00:05:57,830 --> 00:06:00,110
it isn't obvious how much
getting your act together,

175
00:06:00,111 --> 00:06:04,310
it's going to help you find another job
because the actual problem that you're

176
00:06:04,311 --> 00:06:07,880
facing me have relatively
little to do with you.

177
00:06:07,881 --> 00:06:12,110
And that would especially be the case if
you're maybe on the bottom half of the

178
00:06:12,111 --> 00:06:14,150
intelligence distribution for example.

179
00:06:14,151 --> 00:06:18,920
And so it isn't as easy for you just
to go out and pick up new skills at the

180
00:06:18,921 --> 00:06:19,790
drop of a hat,

181
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:20,840
you know?

182
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:24,050
And that gets harder as you get older
because your Iq actually declines quite

183
00:06:24,051 --> 00:06:25,490
substantially as you get older.

184
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:29,360
The working or the the fluid
intelligence part anyways,

185
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:31,490
exercise can keep that at bay,

186
00:06:31,491 --> 00:06:31,911
by the way.

187
00:06:31,911 --> 00:06:33,350
It's the best way to keep that at bay.

188
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:35,263
So anyways,

189
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:41,210
you can think from the phenomenological
viewpoint of your experience as a whole

190
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:44,390
instead of you being a
subject in an objective world.

191
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:45,920
And so here's another way of,

192
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,930
here's something that's quite useful.

193
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:48,310
You'll,

194
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:51,030
Elon talked about this because he
was moving towards a phenomenological

195
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:52,460
perspective later in his life.

196
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:56,570
The last book he wrote was
called mysterium connectionists
and he talked about

197
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:01,490
three conjunctions that needed to take
place in order for someone to be well

198
00:07:01,491 --> 00:07:03,200
constituted psychologically.

199
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:08,560
And you know how Piaget talked about
learning that you could not only follow

200
00:07:08,931 --> 00:07:12,350
rules but that you could make rules for
new games is sort of the highest level

201
00:07:12,351 --> 00:07:13,190
of moral development.

202
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:18,550
I would say young extended the Piagetian
moral continuum up past what Piaget had

203
00:07:20,871 --> 00:07:21,500
envisioned.

204
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:22,333
Now he didn't,

205
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:25,400
he didn't do that cause he wasn't
trying to extend Piaget's model.

206
00:07:25,401 --> 00:07:26,234
But,

207
00:07:26,370 --> 00:07:30,260
but you can think about it the same
way and it's not easy to come up with a

208
00:07:30,261 --> 00:07:35,261
moral motive being say that transcends
the ability to make rules for new games.

209
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:37,190
That's damn smart man.

210
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:37,471
That's,

211
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:37,700
that's,

212
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:40,850
that's a major home run by
Piaget as far as I'm concerned.

213
00:07:40,851 --> 00:07:42,920
But Young said something like this said,

214
00:07:42,921 --> 00:07:43,730
look,

215
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:46,460
when you're going through the
process of psychological integration,

216
00:07:48,770 --> 00:07:50,300
here's a way of conceptualizing it.

217
00:07:50,301 --> 00:07:55,301
And he thought about this as
symbolically as male female pairings.

218
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:58,910
Because as I've tried
to point out the most,

219
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:02,330
one of the most fundamental character
categories that are mythological

220
00:08:02,331 --> 00:08:06,110
imagination uses to structure the
world is the category of masculine and

221
00:08:06,111 --> 00:08:06,800
feminine.

222
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,060
And in moves that around,

223
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:08,331
you know,

224
00:08:08,331 --> 00:08:08,581
it's,

225
00:08:08,581 --> 00:08:09,740
it's a fundamental metaphor.

226
00:08:09,741 --> 00:08:11,270
So you can move that around anywhere.

227
00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:12,680
And so young thought,

228
00:08:12,681 --> 00:08:16,280
well one of the things that you're trying
to do is to get your thoughts and your

229
00:08:16,281 --> 00:08:18,140
emotions integrated.

230
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:19,431
And so,

231
00:08:19,431 --> 00:08:19,761
you know,

232
00:08:19,761 --> 00:08:21,560
the Classic Enlightenment Viewpoint,

233
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:22,760
roughly speaking,

234
00:08:22,761 --> 00:08:26,000
is something like passion
is the enemy of reason,

235
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:27,231
right?

236
00:08:27,231 --> 00:08:29,330
And so to the degree that your rational,

237
00:08:29,331 --> 00:08:30,560
it's sort of a Friday of viewpoint.

238
00:08:30,561 --> 00:08:35,060
It's cause he got your emotions under
control and there's some truth in that,

239
00:08:35,061 --> 00:08:36,620
but not enough truth.

240
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:38,540
I like the Piagetian idea better,

241
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:39,490
which is that,

242
00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:39,690
no,

243
00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:40,100
no,

244
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:41,060
that isn't what happens.

245
00:08:41,061 --> 00:08:41,870
What happens if,

246
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:45,770
if you're playing the proper game
is that you integrate your emotions

247
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:46,851
underneath.

248
00:08:46,851 --> 00:08:48,290
You're thinking something like that.

249
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,510
So they're all working
in the same direction,

250
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:50,841
you know?

251
00:08:50,841 --> 00:08:52,220
So for example,

252
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,530
you can make your anxiety
work against you or for you.

253
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:58,490
And one of the ways I did it,

254
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:01,830
I made a program called the
future authoring program
that I think helps people

255
00:09:01,831 --> 00:09:04,800
do that because one of the things you
see when you're talking to people and

256
00:09:04,801 --> 00:09:07,980
they're trying to solve problems is
that they're afraid to face the problem.

257
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,890
And so then their anxiety
is working against them.

258
00:09:10,891 --> 00:09:12,090
And you can think about it as a,

259
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:14,640
as antagonistic to rationality,

260
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,291
but then I could say,

261
00:09:16,291 --> 00:09:16,830
well,

262
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:20,790
why don't you think for a while about
what your life would be like if you didn't

263
00:09:20,791 --> 00:09:21,840
face this problem?

264
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:24,060
Because if you think that through,

265
00:09:24,061 --> 00:09:28,290
if you have a problem and you really
think through what the consequences are

266
00:09:28,291 --> 00:09:30,540
going to be in three to
five years of not facing it,

267
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:33,120
then you're going to get
more afraid of not facing it,

268
00:09:33,121 --> 00:09:33,954
then facing it.

269
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:38,040
And that's great because then your anxiety
instead of standing in front of you,

270
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:41,880
instead of you having a dragon that's
guarding the path in front of you,

271
00:09:41,881 --> 00:09:44,820
where you have one chasing
you down the path from behind,

272
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,560
that's a lot more useful.

273
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:48,143
And so,

274
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:48,721
you know,

275
00:09:48,721 --> 00:09:53,721
that's just a minimal example of the
utility of getting your emotions and your,

276
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:56,430
and your thoughts aligned the same way.

277
00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:58,230
The same thing happens with aggression.

278
00:09:59,100 --> 00:09:59,670
You know,

279
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:03,690
one of the most common reasons that people
come and seek psychotherapy really is

280
00:10:03,691 --> 00:10:04,950
because they're too agreeable.

281
00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:07,350
But what that means is
they're not assertive enough.

282
00:10:07,351 --> 00:10:09,510
They have an integrated their
capacity for aggression.

283
00:10:09,511 --> 00:10:12,190
And so other people can
push them around and,

284
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:14,730
and they're very conflict avoidant.

285
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:15,500
And,

286
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:19,920
and so the consequences of that across
time is that you don't stand up for

287
00:10:19,921 --> 00:10:24,480
yourself well enough and you get taken
advantage of and that spirals badly

288
00:10:24,481 --> 00:10:24,991
downward.

289
00:10:24,991 --> 00:10:29,991
And so partly what you do when you're
doing assertiveness training with people

290
00:10:30,691 --> 00:10:32,370
is you find out what they're angry about.

291
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:36,960
And there are usually Angley angry if
they're not assertive enough because other

292
00:10:36,961 --> 00:10:38,250
people are taking advantage of them.

293
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:42,990
Or You could say because they're not
putting their own necessities forward with

294
00:10:42,991 --> 00:10:43,741
enough force.

295
00:10:43,741 --> 00:10:45,720
It's hard to distinguish
between those two things.

296
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:47,011
But anyways,

297
00:10:47,011 --> 00:10:48,440
you try,

298
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:51,600
you get them to talk about what they're
angry about that often makes them cry

299
00:10:51,810 --> 00:10:53,460
often many times.

300
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:57,850
And then you get them to kind of envision
what they would want to have in stead,

301
00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:01,830
which they're often afraid to do because
people are afraid to think about what

302
00:11:01,831 --> 00:11:05,520
they want because that makes it more
clear when they're not getting it.

303
00:11:05,521 --> 00:11:06,630
And that's painful,

304
00:11:06,631 --> 00:11:06,871
right?

305
00:11:06,871 --> 00:11:10,290
Or maybe they're afraid of hoping
so they won't specify a clear aim.

306
00:11:10,530 --> 00:11:11,041
But anyways,

307
00:11:11,041 --> 00:11:13,310
you get them to think
about what they might want.

308
00:11:13,330 --> 00:11:17,580
Instead you get them to think about the
costs of not pursuing that and then you

309
00:11:17,581 --> 00:11:22,581
help them develop strategies
for integrating their
aggression and with their

310
00:11:23,761 --> 00:11:27,930
thinking so that they can come up with
a plan to approach the world in a more

311
00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:28,770
confident way.

312
00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:29,551
So for example,

313
00:11:29,551 --> 00:11:30,720
someone might come to me and say,

314
00:11:30,721 --> 00:11:32,610
I'm being bullied badly at work.

315
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:34,080
And so then I'll say,

316
00:11:34,081 --> 00:11:34,560
well,

317
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:35,580
what are your options?

318
00:11:36,450 --> 00:11:37,620
You have to put up with it.

319
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:38,570
Well we'll,

320
00:11:38,570 --> 00:11:39,361
we'll figure that out.

321
00:11:39,361 --> 00:11:40,081
Cause maybe you do,

322
00:11:40,081 --> 00:11:41,190
maybe you don't have options,

323
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:42,540
but here's how to find out.

324
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,990
Get your damn CV together
so it's pristine,

325
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:46,750
right?

326
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:46,990
It's,

327
00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:51,150
it's ready to go get over your fear of
a new interview because it people are

328
00:11:51,151 --> 00:11:52,140
generally afraid of that.

329
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:53,140
Get over your,

330
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:54,520
of applying for a new job.

331
00:11:54,521 --> 00:11:57,460
Start thinking about what it would
mean to have a different job.

332
00:11:57,970 --> 00:12:02,080
Start thinking about what it would mean
to have a better job even because maybe

333
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:04,180
your fear is just making you stuck here.

334
00:12:04,210 --> 00:12:05,320
But I can tell you one thing,

335
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:08,380
if someone's picking on you at
work and you don't have options,

336
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:09,543
you lose.

337
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:12,640
So you get the person to
start building a strategy.

338
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:12,971
It's like,

339
00:12:12,971 --> 00:12:13,600
okay,

340
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,150
if you're going to tell
this person to stop,

341
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:19,990
you have to know how to make them stop
and one and the one thing you need for

342
00:12:19,991 --> 00:12:21,220
sure is an option.

343
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:22,443
And if you can't,

344
00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:24,400
if you don't have an option,

345
00:12:24,401 --> 00:12:27,700
then maybe we start thinking about the
fact that you need some more training or

346
00:12:27,701 --> 00:12:31,480
something like that because you cannot
negotiate if you don't have any power.

347
00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:33,460
So because while,

348
00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:36,730
especially if you're dealing with someone
who's really out to get you or really

349
00:12:36,731 --> 00:12:37,564
disagreeable,

350
00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:40,720
if you don't have a leg to stand on and
they'll just push you over and maybe

351
00:12:40,721 --> 00:12:43,180
they'll jump on youtube because that's
what they're like and they enjoy it

352
00:12:43,181 --> 00:12:43,591
anyways.

353
00:12:43,591 --> 00:12:44,950
So it's no joke.

354
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:49,780
So you'll put your options behind
you and then you start to think about

355
00:12:49,781 --> 00:12:50,351
strategies.

356
00:12:50,351 --> 00:12:51,161
So I tell people,

357
00:12:51,161 --> 00:12:51,970
look,

358
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:53,620
if you're being harassed at work,

359
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:56,020
you document it every time it
happens and you write it out.

360
00:12:56,110 --> 00:12:59,860
So you've got like 20 stories
about it and it's fully documented.

361
00:12:59,861 --> 00:13:02,170
And then you go confront
the person at some point,

362
00:13:02,171 --> 00:13:06,340
but with at least three pieces of evidence
and you have some sense of what you

363
00:13:06,341 --> 00:13:09,310
tell them about what will
happen if they don't stop.

364
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:10,750
So you have to figure out,

365
00:13:10,751 --> 00:13:11,410
well,

366
00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:12,280
if they don't stop,

367
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:13,473
what are you gonna do about it?

368
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,033
Leave.

369
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:16,330
Not if you can't leave.

370
00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:17,090
So you,

371
00:13:17,090 --> 00:13:18,460
you have to be able to,

372
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:21,160
what is it wield a big
stick and speak softly,

373
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:22,630
but you see that way.

374
00:13:22,631 --> 00:13:23,290
It's,

375
00:13:23,290 --> 00:13:25,210
that's how you take your aggression,

376
00:13:25,211 --> 00:13:30,211
which is an absolutely necessary part
of your psyche and manifest it up into a

377
00:13:30,491 --> 00:13:33,220
sophisticated means of
dealing with the world.

378
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:34,450
You don't just suppress it.

379
00:13:34,451 --> 00:13:34,691
You say,

380
00:13:34,691 --> 00:13:38,200
well I should be able to put up with
it or I wish I wasn't so angry or

381
00:13:38,201 --> 00:13:38,530
something.

382
00:13:38,530 --> 00:13:39,700
It's like forget that.

383
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:43,960
That's all that'll happen is your blood
pressure will stay high and you'll die

384
00:13:43,961 --> 00:13:44,651
of a heart attack.

385
00:13:44,651 --> 00:13:45,790
Because anger for example,

386
00:13:45,791 --> 00:13:49,660
is a very toxic emotion and it
does cause heart damage over time.

387
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:53,140
It's the only emotion that we really
know that's been linked to things like

388
00:13:53,141 --> 00:13:55,190
cardiovascular risk and anger is,

389
00:13:55,270 --> 00:13:58,720
is toxic because it's
like you're driving a car,

390
00:13:58,721 --> 00:13:58,960
you've,

391
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:01,780
you're stepping on the gas and pushing
on the brake at the same time because

392
00:14:01,781 --> 00:14:06,400
anger tells you to run away and to attack
at the same time cause you don't know

393
00:14:06,401 --> 00:14:07,234
what's going to happen.

394
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:08,080
And so it,

395
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:12,280
it really amps up the
physiological demand on your body.

396
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:13,593
And so if you,

397
00:14:13,810 --> 00:14:15,670
including your heart and your musculature.

398
00:14:15,671 --> 00:14:17,860
So if you stay like
that for like 10 years,

399
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:22,690
you know you're going to age
20 years and that's a bad plan.

400
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:24,423
So,

401
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:26,320
so,

402
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:26,621
you know,

403
00:14:26,621 --> 00:14:30,760
you take your underground emotions and
you integrate them into a sophisticated

404
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:31,780
reality.
