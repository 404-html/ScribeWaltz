1
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:06,741
See,

2
00:00:06,741 --> 00:00:10,850
I really liked the psycho analyst and
I liked the idea that you have a psyche

3
00:00:10,851 --> 00:00:14,780
that's inside of you and that that is
structured in partly consciously and in

4
00:00:14,781 --> 00:00:16,280
part conch unconsciously.

5
00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:19,910
There's something about that that's really
cool and I've learned a lot from the

6
00:00:19,911 --> 00:00:20,810
psychoanalyst,

7
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:21,711
but you know,

8
00:00:21,711 --> 00:00:26,711
there is a funny consequence of thinking
the way they think and you do think the

9
00:00:26,841 --> 00:00:27,471
way they think,

10
00:00:27,471 --> 00:00:28,460
even if you don't know it.

11
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:32,090
Like we tend to think that a
lot of us is inside our head.

12
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:32,930
You know,

13
00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:34,910
that's the psyche model basically.

14
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:38,270
But the more I've practiced
as a clinical psychologist,

15
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:38,781
the last,

16
00:00:38,781 --> 00:00:40,670
I've actually been
convinced that that's true.

17
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:42,291
So I could say,

18
00:00:42,291 --> 00:00:42,620
well,

19
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:45,110
let's say I want to know
about your personality.

20
00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:46,011
We think,

21
00:00:46,011 --> 00:00:46,131
well,

22
00:00:46,131 --> 00:00:47,030
I want to know you.

23
00:00:47,031 --> 00:00:49,520
I want to know about your subjectivity.

24
00:00:49,521 --> 00:00:50,960
I didn't want to know
what's inside of you,

25
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:52,550
but that isn't actually what you do.

26
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:53,240
Want to know if,

27
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:53,490
if,

28
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:54,590
if you're doing clinical work,

29
00:00:54,591 --> 00:00:56,720
say with someone you want to know,

30
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,240
did they have any friends?

31
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:04,790
That's really important because if you're
miserable and anxious and badly placed

32
00:01:04,791 --> 00:01:06,830
in life and misbehaving,

33
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:10,640
one of the reasons that all of that
can occur is because you don't have any

34
00:01:10,641 --> 00:01:10,941
friends.

35
00:01:10,941 --> 00:01:11,774
You don't know anyone,

36
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:14,270
and that's not something
that's inside you.

37
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:15,450
It's,

38
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:19,160
it's you localized in a broader sphere.

39
00:01:19,161 --> 00:01:19,911
And then you might say,

40
00:01:19,911 --> 00:01:20,151
well,

41
00:01:20,151 --> 00:01:20,984
do you have job?

42
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,420
And while let's talk about the job,

43
00:01:23,421 --> 00:01:25,280
do you actually make
enough money with your job?

44
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:27,680
Is it satisfying for you in any way?

45
00:01:27,681 --> 00:01:28,970
Are you bullied all the time?

46
00:01:28,971 --> 00:01:29,804
When you're at work?

47
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:31,250
Does it provoke anxiety?

48
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:34,040
Is it a career that allows
you to go somewhere?

49
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:35,330
Are you overworked?

50
00:01:35,690 --> 00:01:36,050
Well,

51
00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:37,850
but let's start with
just the first question.

52
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:39,380
Do you have a job?

53
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:39,711
Well,

54
00:01:39,711 --> 00:01:41,360
if the answer to that is no,

55
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:44,600
you have a serious problem
and that would enough,

56
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:48,470
might be too depressed you and make you
anxious and hopeless and nihilistic and

57
00:01:48,471 --> 00:01:49,304
all of those things.

58
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:50,331
And you could say,

59
00:01:50,331 --> 00:01:50,541
well,

60
00:01:50,541 --> 00:01:53,240
you're not reacting very
well to not having a job.

61
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:55,580
But that's kind of a foolish objection.

62
00:01:55,581 --> 00:01:57,110
Even though some of it might be true.

63
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:58,270
One problem is,

64
00:01:58,271 --> 00:02:00,800
is that you're not reacting
very well to not having a job,

65
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:04,580
but in other problem is that you don't
have a job and that actually constitutes

66
00:02:04,581 --> 00:02:05,414
a problem,

67
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:06,020
right?

68
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:07,070
You don't get to eat.

69
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:08,510
You don't have a place to live.

70
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:10,640
So those aren't psychological problems.

71
00:02:10,641 --> 00:02:11,181
Precisely.

72
00:02:11,181 --> 00:02:14,030
Even though a psychological
problem could make it worse.

73
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:17,150
Well are you as educated as you should be?

74
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:18,290
That's another question.

75
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:20,120
How do you handle drugs and alcohol?

76
00:02:20,121 --> 00:02:21,950
Are they taking you down a bad pathway?

77
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,113
You know?

78
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:24,043
Um,

79
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:26,390
what about intimate relationships?

80
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:27,283
We have one,

81
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:28,960
you have a plan for one or they,

82
00:02:28,961 --> 00:02:32,270
is that a never ending series of
catastrophes or something that you avoid

83
00:02:32,271 --> 00:02:33,104
completely.

84
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:34,250
That's a big problem.

85
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:35,780
And maybe people don't,

86
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,060
aren't attracted to you
for one reason or another.

87
00:02:38,061 --> 00:02:40,430
And you could think about that
as a psychological problem,

88
00:02:40,431 --> 00:02:42,560
but it's an interpersonal problem.

89
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:46,070
And the degree to which that's
a psychological problem is,

90
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:50,360
is certainly an specified when you
first begin to talk to somebody.

91
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:51,590
What about your family?

92
00:02:51,591 --> 00:02:52,610
Do you have a family?

93
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:55,370
Cause it's hard to be in
the world all by yourself,

94
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,233
that's for sure.

95
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,160
It makes things a lot more stressful.

96
00:02:58,161 --> 00:03:01,420
Even though having a family can
also be extraordinarily stressful.

97
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:02,081
I mean,

98
00:03:02,081 --> 00:03:03,940
don't do you have plans to have children?

99
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:05,440
How are you doing with your parents?

100
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:07,180
Do you get along with your siblings?

101
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:07,841
You know,

102
00:03:07,841 --> 00:03:08,620
all of that.

103
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:12,250
All of that to me is more
fundamental and it's outside of you.

104
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:17,580
Those are elements of your experience
more broadly conceptualized more than they

105
00:03:17,831 --> 00:03:21,610
are objects of your psychology
or of your internal experience.

106
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:22,471
You know,

107
00:03:22,471 --> 00:03:23,304
it's sort of like

108
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,111
while a person is,

109
00:03:28,111 --> 00:03:28,710
uh,

110
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:32,040
is it is a creature that exists
at multiple levels of analysis,

111
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:33,360
right?

112
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,910
Something might go wrong
with you at a cellular level,

113
00:03:35,911 --> 00:03:38,340
so maybe you're born with
a genetic abnormality,

114
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:42,420
so something's wrong with you molecularly
or you have something wrong with a

115
00:03:42,421 --> 00:03:43,260
major organ.

116
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,960
Or maybe there's something
wrong with you psychologically,

117
00:03:45,961 --> 00:03:50,310
or maybe you're in a pathological family
or maybe you're stuck in a pathological

118
00:03:50,311 --> 00:03:53,670
social system and figuring out what's,

119
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:57,840
why you're suffering means going
up and down those different levels.

120
00:03:57,841 --> 00:04:01,770
Trying to specify the appropriate level
for analysis and also the appropriate

121
00:04:01,771 --> 00:04:02,850
level for intervention.

122
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:04,440
And for me as a,

123
00:04:04,441 --> 00:04:05,071
as I've said,

124
00:04:05,071 --> 00:04:08,580
even though I'm a great admirer of the
psychoanalysts and I do things like dream

125
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:09,061
analysis,

126
00:04:09,061 --> 00:04:13,860
which I really find you an incredibly
useful and enlightening the first,

127
00:04:13,861 --> 00:04:15,450
the fundamental level of analysis is,

128
00:04:15,451 --> 00:04:15,611
well,

129
00:04:15,611 --> 00:04:17,340
what's your experience structured like?

130
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:18,533
Exactly.

131
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:20,310
And that isn't localized in you.

132
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:24,420
Now the behaviorists do that too because
it's one of the things I really liked

133
00:04:24,421 --> 00:04:26,280
about the behavioral
approach to psychotherapy.

134
00:04:26,281 --> 00:04:26,701
It's very,

135
00:04:26,701 --> 00:04:27,990
very concrete and practical.

136
00:04:27,991 --> 00:04:29,280
It's like they'll say,

137
00:04:29,281 --> 00:04:30,114
well,

138
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:33,420
there are certain things that you need
to have in order to live properly and

139
00:04:33,421 --> 00:04:37,050
maybe you don't have the skills or the
wherewithal wherewithal to accumulate

140
00:04:37,051 --> 00:04:40,140
them and we'll break them down into
tiny little pieces and you'll practice.

141
00:04:40,141 --> 00:04:41,010
So for example,

142
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:42,990
with someone who doesn't have any friends,

143
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:46,410
then you do a micro analysis
of their social skills,

144
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:50,700
say and maybe an analysis of the kinds
of anxiety that are stopping them from

145
00:04:50,701 --> 00:04:52,140
going out and meeting people.

146
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:55,020
And then you address those
things practically one by one.

147
00:04:55,021 --> 00:04:56,820
You tried to get the person
to have some friends.

148
00:04:57,110 --> 00:05:00,240
He tried to figure out how they can
establish an intimate relationship.

149
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,670
You see if you can help
them sort out their family,

150
00:05:02,671 --> 00:05:04,560
you do what you can
about their employment.

151
00:05:04,561 --> 00:05:08,910
And a lot of that's only tangentially
related to really in some sense to the

152
00:05:08,911 --> 00:05:10,050
structure of their psyche.

153
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:14,970
But one of the things you'll see if you
work as a clinician or as a counselor is

154
00:05:14,971 --> 00:05:18,000
that most of the time people come and
see you because they have problems,

155
00:05:18,001 --> 00:05:22,170
not because they have
psychological problems and
those things are not that easy

156
00:05:22,171 --> 00:05:23,070
to distinguish.

157
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:23,761
You know,

158
00:05:23,761 --> 00:05:25,400
it's sort of the psychoanalytic idea,

159
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:25,861
sort of like,

160
00:05:25,861 --> 00:05:26,041
well,

161
00:05:26,041 --> 00:05:27,450
if you just start your act together,

162
00:05:27,451 --> 00:05:28,860
everything would work out for you.

163
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:29,820
It's like,

164
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:30,653
yeah,

165
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,153
yeah,

166
00:05:33,890 --> 00:05:35,000
there's some truth in that,

167
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:36,733
but

168
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,193
okay.

169
00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:40,161
But you know,

170
00:05:40,161 --> 00:05:43,190
if you're 55 years old and
you've just been laid off work,

171
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:44,750
okay,

172
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:46,520
and maybe through no fault of your own,

173
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:48,480
yeah,

174
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:50,670
it isn't obvious how much
getting your act together,

175
00:05:50,671 --> 00:05:53,390
it's going to help you find
another job because the,

176
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:58,460
the actual problem that you're facing
me have relatively to do with you.

177
00:05:58,461 --> 00:06:02,690
And that would especially be the case if
you're maybe on the bottom half of the

178
00:06:02,691 --> 00:06:04,730
intelligence distribution for example.

179
00:06:04,731 --> 00:06:09,500
And so it isn't as easy for you just
to go out and pick up new skills at the

180
00:06:09,501 --> 00:06:10,400
drop of a hat,

181
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:11,420
you know?

182
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:14,630
And that gets harder as you get older
because your Iq actually declines quite

183
00:06:14,631 --> 00:06:16,070
substantially as you get older.

184
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:19,940
The working or the the fluid
intelligence part anyways,

185
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:22,070
exercise can keep that at bay,

186
00:06:22,071 --> 00:06:22,491
by the way.

187
00:06:22,491 --> 00:06:23,930
It's the best way to keep that at bay.
