1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:03,810
You're going to be resentful and bitter
in many situations because you don't get

2
00:00:03,811 --> 00:00:06,240
what you want and if you watch that
resentment,

3
00:00:06,241 --> 00:00:07,200
bitterness,
clc,

4
00:00:07,201 --> 00:00:11,910
that it produces fantasies that can be
unbelievably dark and that can be very

5
00:00:11,911 --> 00:00:15,270
frightening and you might not want to
admit to yourself that you're actually

6
00:00:15,271 --> 00:00:19,950
capable of having fantasies like that or
impulses of like that or aggressive

7
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:23,670
feelings like that.
But the thing is is that if those

8
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:27,570
aggressive feelings and impulses and
fantasies are integrated into your

9
00:00:27,571 --> 00:00:29,580
character,
it's like you're opening up a dialogue

10
00:00:29,581 --> 00:00:33,600
with a part of yourself that can be very
forceful and strong and dangerous,

11
00:00:33,601 --> 00:00:38,100
and it's really useful to be dangerous
because if you can,

12
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:41,280
if you can be dangerous,
you often don't have to be,

13
00:00:41,281 --> 00:00:42,900
and it's often weak.
People,

14
00:00:42,901 --> 00:00:45,000
for example,
it's weak men generally speaking,

15
00:00:45,001 --> 00:00:47,370
who rape.
You know that that's a very,

16
00:00:47,371 --> 00:00:49,590
very common occurrence and that's a
violent act,

17
00:00:49,591 --> 00:00:51,960
but it's born out of weakness,
not out of strength.

18
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:54,990
That's for sure.
And so anyways,

19
00:00:54,991 --> 00:00:58,470
you attend to your resentment honestly,
and you observe yourself and what you're

20
00:00:58,471 --> 00:01:01,110
actually like.
You got to pay attention as if you don't

21
00:01:01,111 --> 00:01:04,800
know yourself as if you might harbor
hidden devils and then maybe they'll

22
00:01:04,801 --> 00:01:05,634
emerge.
Now.

23
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:09,340
Young also felt that sort of embedded
inside the shower where the contra

24
00:01:09,341 --> 00:01:13,450
sexual tendencies and so for example,
sometimes you see people who are well

25
00:01:13,451 --> 00:01:15,810
developed men let's say,
and we can.

26
00:01:15,811 --> 00:01:18,060
We can also talk about women in this
regard.

27
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:22,980
Men who've integrated their shadow often
also develop a kind of peculiar grace

28
00:01:22,981 --> 00:01:27,981
that would be a consequence of not only
allowing their aggressive side to step

29
00:01:28,111 --> 00:01:31,140
forward,
but also their feminine in Compassionate

30
00:01:31,141 --> 00:01:33,660
side that might,
that they may have kept squelched

31
00:01:33,661 --> 00:01:36,450
because of embarrassment about it or
because they'd been harassed for being

32
00:01:36,451 --> 00:01:40,050
weak or any number of things so,
but the practical approach for

33
00:01:40,051 --> 00:01:44,010
developing your shadow,
I would say is to contemplate and

34
00:01:44,011 --> 00:01:48,210
consider your resentment and notice what
it says and because your resentment will

35
00:01:48,211 --> 00:01:50,190
also tell you what you have to say.

36
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:52,220
You know,
so look,

37
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:53,880
look at what happened at Google this
weekend.

38
00:01:53,881 --> 00:01:56,280
You know,
James Damore wrote that memo and you can

39
00:01:56,281 --> 00:02:00,630
imagine he was pretty angry and perhaps
even somewhat resentful at having to

40
00:02:00,631 --> 00:02:03,360
attend that diversity seminar,
and I'm really just using this as an

41
00:02:03,361 --> 00:02:07,440
example,
but what he did was decide that that

42
00:02:07,441 --> 00:02:10,860
meant that he had something that he had
to say and then look at the consequences

43
00:02:10,861 --> 00:02:11,491
of that.
Man.

44
00:02:11,491 --> 00:02:14,220
It's an absolutely unbelievable and so
you know,

45
00:02:14,221 --> 00:02:18,120
if you're feeling oppressed at work or
you're oppressed in your life or or you

46
00:02:18,121 --> 00:02:21,390
know where you're expressing yourself,
then you got to notice that you're

47
00:02:21,391 --> 00:02:23,130
feeling oppressed.
Then you have to notice that you're

48
00:02:23,131 --> 00:02:25,170
feeling resentful,
resentful,

49
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:29,500
and angry and bitter and maybe even like
Cain in the story of Cain and Abel

50
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,920
because Cain is sort of the archetype of
bitter man.

51
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:35,670
And then you have to decide what it is
that you need to do in order to remove

52
00:02:35,671 --> 00:02:37,110
from yourself that bitterness.

53
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:40,230
And that's usually means that there's
something that you have to say and then

54
00:02:40,231 --> 00:02:42,630
you have to say it because you're soul
depends on it.

55
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,610
And not only does your soul depend on
it.

56
00:02:44,611 --> 00:02:48,150
I would say the fate of the world
depends on it because you know you might

57
00:02:48,151 --> 00:02:50,640
be wrong and then you should be
straightened out.

58
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:53,370
Maybe you're just being windy and you
have to talk to somebody about that,

59
00:02:53,371 --> 00:02:56,430
but it may be that you're actually
detecting something wrong.

60
00:02:56,431 --> 00:02:59,190
Some tyranny that's directed towards you
and other people,

61
00:02:59,191 --> 00:03:02,040
and it's like your moral obligation to
speak up about it.
