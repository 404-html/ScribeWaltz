1
00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:09,723
Yeah.

2
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:13,550
So don't be thinking that the things
that appeared in front of you are merely

3
00:00:13,551 --> 00:00:14,990
objects because they're not,

4
00:00:15,590 --> 00:00:16,010
you know,

5
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:17,900
I started thinking about this for example,

6
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:22,280
when I was thinking about people going
down to Graceland to look at Elvis

7
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:22,850
Guitar,

8
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:23,683
you think,

9
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:29,750
what exactly is it that makes
a guitar Elvis and his guitar?

10
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:30,711
You know,

11
00:00:30,711 --> 00:00:35,510
it's not exactly the guitar because it's
just sitting there like any old guitar,

12
00:00:35,511 --> 00:00:35,811
you know,

13
00:00:35,811 --> 00:00:37,160
and maybe you could even think about it.

14
00:00:37,161 --> 00:00:40,160
You could take that and guitar out and
he could put another guitar in that look

15
00:00:40,161 --> 00:00:43,520
just like it and it would still be all
of us as guitar cause no one would know.

16
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:44,541
And you might think,

17
00:00:44,541 --> 00:00:45,980
well then that's not really,

18
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:47,210
Elvis has guitar.

19
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:52,250
But that's a funny thing because you
would only think that if you thought that

20
00:00:52,251 --> 00:00:55,610
Elvis is guitar was the thing that was
made out of material that was sitting

21
00:00:55,611 --> 00:00:56,480
right in front of you.

22
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:58,670
And that isn't what it is.

23
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:01,130
That's only one tiny little bit of it.

24
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:02,300
That bloody thing is,

25
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:06,140
is a part of an incredibly
layered reality.

26
00:01:06,141 --> 00:01:06,740
Right?

27
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:07,573
I mean,

28
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:11,030
the people who want to go look at that,

29
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:14,660
they're looking at it in some sense
because of the magic that's emanating from

30
00:01:14,661 --> 00:01:14,781
it.

31
00:01:14,781 --> 00:01:16,460
But the magic is actually real.

32
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:17,061
You know,

33
00:01:17,061 --> 00:01:19,760
the magic is the effect of that guitar,

34
00:01:19,761 --> 00:01:20,271
let's say,

35
00:01:20,271 --> 00:01:21,860
on the entire culture.

36
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:24,500
And those effects are the damn guitar too.

37
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:27,410
And it's weird because when
you go look at Elvis Guitar,

38
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:29,120
you don't have looking at the guitar,

39
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:30,590
you're looking at the magic.

40
00:01:30,830 --> 00:01:31,730
And weirdly enough,

41
00:01:31,731 --> 00:01:33,740
the magic is actually real.

42
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:34,671
Well,

43
00:01:34,671 --> 00:01:37,580
you can't think that way if you're a
materialist because you think that the

44
00:01:37,581 --> 00:01:38,720
thing is the material.

45
00:01:38,721 --> 00:01:39,230
It's like,

46
00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:39,561
yeah,

47
00:01:39,561 --> 00:01:40,310
right.

48
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:41,660
I can tell you another story.

49
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:43,760
So when the,

50
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:46,640
when the Europeans came to
the South Pacific islands,

51
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:48,440
the South Pacific islanders,

52
00:01:48,441 --> 00:01:49,610
because there weren't that many of them,

53
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:51,470
they didn't have a very high,

54
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:53,000
highly technical society,

55
00:01:53,001 --> 00:01:53,241
you know?

56
00:01:53,241 --> 00:01:58,241
And so like if you were like Joe
Dominant guy in a Pacific island culture,

57
00:01:59,630 --> 00:01:59,901
you know,

58
00:01:59,901 --> 00:02:01,640
you might be able to have a stone ax,

59
00:02:01,641 --> 00:02:05,510
like a well made stone ax because going
make a stone ax and see how long that

60
00:02:05,511 --> 00:02:05,900
takes you.

61
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:06,540
It's like,

62
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:06,680
oh,

63
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:07,700
that's a bit of work.

64
00:02:07,701 --> 00:02:09,710
And so if you're a high status guy,

65
00:02:09,711 --> 00:02:12,980
if you've really worked your whole life
to be at the top of your Damn pyramid,

66
00:02:12,981 --> 00:02:13,520
you get,

67
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,110
maybe you get head to access.

68
00:02:15,111 --> 00:02:15,381
You know,

69
00:02:15,381 --> 00:02:16,640
it's like a red letter day.

70
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:18,250
You've got two axes,

71
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:19,130
you know,

72
00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:22,070
which is more than any
other animal has by a lot.

73
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:23,480
So it's not trivial.

74
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:25,550
And then the damn
missionaries come in and they,

75
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:28,430
and they set up shop
and what do they bring?

76
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:30,980
Steel axes.

77
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:33,680
It's like that's kind of a downer.

78
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:34,340
You know,

79
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:37,820
you've worked your whole damn life to
get these stone axes and that makes you

80
00:02:37,821 --> 00:02:41,690
like head tribesmen and then you want
your kid wanders down to the local

81
00:02:41,691 --> 00:02:42,830
missionaries and they say,

82
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:43,281
hey,

83
00:02:43,281 --> 00:02:44,780
we got an extra steel ax here.

84
00:02:44,781 --> 00:02:46,220
Why don't you take that back home?

85
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:46,971
And it's like,

86
00:02:46,971 --> 00:02:51,050
it's so shocking because not only did
the missionaries have this thing that is

87
00:02:51,051 --> 00:02:52,730
so much better than a steel ax,

88
00:02:52,731 --> 00:02:55,130
it's like a jet plane compared to a,

89
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:56,700
yeah,

90
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:57,930
to a wheeled cart.

91
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:58,920
Like they're really,

92
00:02:58,930 --> 00:02:59,800
really different.

93
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:01,510
But the missionaries,

94
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:03,070
they don't even notice.

95
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,900
That's the horrible thing about it.

96
00:03:04,901 --> 00:03:05,734
It's like the giveaway,

97
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:08,230
this thing that hasn't been
virtually infinite value,

98
00:03:08,231 --> 00:03:08,681
and it's like,

99
00:03:08,681 --> 00:03:08,901
well,

100
00:03:08,901 --> 00:03:09,371
it's okay.

101
00:03:09,371 --> 00:03:09,701
We got,

102
00:03:09,701 --> 00:03:09,891
you know,

103
00:03:09,891 --> 00:03:12,410
a couple dozen of those sitting
in the store room and you know,

104
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:13,900
we're just willing to hand them out.

105
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:15,280
It was a little demoralizing.

106
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,550
It was a little demoralizing
for the Pacific Islanders,

107
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:19,601
and so,

108
00:03:19,601 --> 00:03:20,110
you know,

109
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:22,810
why was it an ax that the
missionaries gave away?

110
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:25,473
It wasn't.

111
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:29,050
You'd think that if you are a Westerner
and you had a bunch of access,

112
00:03:29,051 --> 00:03:29,411
it's like,

113
00:03:29,411 --> 00:03:29,591
yeah,

114
00:03:29,591 --> 00:03:30,311
that's an ax.

115
00:03:30,311 --> 00:03:30,611
It's like,

116
00:03:30,611 --> 00:03:30,881
yeah,

117
00:03:30,881 --> 00:03:31,714
right.

118
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:33,160
It's a lot more than an ax,

119
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,233
a lot more.

120
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:37,060
It's a weapon to bring down
a whole culture accidentally.
