1
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:13,170
I probably Matt,
Matt massacre that name says who has a

2
00:00:13,171 --> 00:00:15,750
higher Iq.
I really gifted mathematician or a

3
00:00:15,751 --> 00:00:18,960
really gifted painter,
very difficult to say.

4
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:23,430
Um,
but I would say that gifted math,

5
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:26,430
because if they're both gifted,
they both have high Iq,

6
00:00:26,431 --> 00:00:29,550
so you can be certain of that.
It's very difficult to do anything

7
00:00:29,551 --> 00:00:32,370
that's truly gifted,
say above the average,

8
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:37,420
above the norm without being,
without having a very high Iq and in a

9
00:00:37,421 --> 00:00:40,320
creative realm.
I mean you hear about these idiot savant

10
00:00:40,321 --> 00:00:43,230
who have like one area of extreme
expertise,

11
00:00:43,231 --> 00:00:47,730
but generally in those cases it's not so
much that they have one area of extreme

12
00:00:47,731 --> 00:00:50,700
expertise,
it's that they have one area of above

13
00:00:50,701 --> 00:00:54,600
average expertise that really contrast
with the rest of their impairments,

14
00:00:54,601 --> 00:00:57,510
but they rarely if ever,
make it into the,

15
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:00,150
you know,
the very short list of true geniuses.

16
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:04,940
Mathematicians are kind of an odd bunch
though because you,

17
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:06,840
they peek really,
really early.

18
00:01:06,841 --> 00:01:09,900
Like if you're going to be a
mathematician and truly gifted,

19
00:01:09,901 --> 00:01:14,901
then you're going to show signs of that
when you're like 17 to 20 something like

20
00:01:15,241 --> 00:01:17,760
that.
Whereas painters can,

21
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:21,060
can be creative through their entire
lifespan.

22
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:24,330
Um,
I would say probably on average,

23
00:01:24,331 --> 00:01:28,440
I would guess this is a guest that if
you took a hundred really gifted

24
00:01:28,441 --> 00:01:30,720
mathematicians and a hundred really
gifted painters,

25
00:01:30,721 --> 00:01:35,721
that the mathematicians would have far
higher nonverbal Iq,

26
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:39,400
but the painters might have higher
verbal Iq was.

27
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:42,690
So that also complicates things seat
with Iq.

28
00:01:42,691 --> 00:01:45,060
Also,
you know,

29
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:48,360
there's,
there's this factor called the g factor,

30
00:01:48,361 --> 00:01:51,390
which is the central element of
intelligence.

31
00:01:51,391 --> 00:01:56,010
And it seems to be associated with such
things as head size and brain size

32
00:01:56,011 --> 00:02:00,510
relative to body and neural conduction
speed and simple reaction time,

33
00:02:00,511 --> 00:02:04,050
like really basic physiological markers.
Um,

34
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:09,630
and it's a pretty tight single factors
say as opposed to the personality

35
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:12,810
dimension domain where there's five
quite clear factors.

36
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:18,230
But I think it was Earl hunt research
indicated that as people get smarter and

37
00:02:18,661 --> 00:02:22,590
smarter,
the variability between the subsets of

38
00:02:22,591 --> 00:02:25,230
their intelligence starts to increase.
So it's sort of like,

39
00:02:25,231 --> 00:02:27,030
there's a lot of ways to be really
smart,

40
00:02:27,031 --> 00:02:29,670
but there's only one way to be not very
smart.

41
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,820
So,
um,

42
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:35,550
that's another little tidbit of
information with regards to Iq.
