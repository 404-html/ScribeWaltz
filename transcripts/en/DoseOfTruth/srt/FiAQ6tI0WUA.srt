1
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:05,130
So you would ask that.

2
00:00:05,131 --> 00:00:05,964
The question is,

3
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:12,980
the question is speech
brings order out of chaos.

4
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:13,921
That's what I said,

5
00:00:13,921 --> 00:00:18,750
but it appears that speech brings
chaos out of order as well.

6
00:00:18,751 --> 00:00:20,190
And the answer to that is it does.

7
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:21,180
All right.

8
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:25,170
There was only so many complications I
can address in the talk simultaneously.

9
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:26,513
Um,

10
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:27,480
if you look out,

11
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:30,570
if you look at the most
archaic of Archetipal Heroes,

12
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:34,620
those heroes confront something
that represents chaos.

13
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:36,240
It's usually a monster,

14
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:38,220
the bears a treasure of some sort.

15
00:00:38,221 --> 00:00:42,990
And that's a symbolic representation
of the class of all unexplored things,

16
00:00:42,991 --> 00:00:43,231
right?

17
00:00:43,231 --> 00:00:46,500
Because things that we have not yet
explored are threatening and destructive,

18
00:00:46,501 --> 00:00:49,290
but also offer us infinite potential,

19
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:52,560
but more elaborated hero stories,

20
00:00:52,561 --> 00:00:53,220
let's say.

21
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:54,930
Also reverse that and say that,

22
00:00:54,931 --> 00:00:55,111
well,

23
00:00:55,111 --> 00:00:57,990
there are times when the order
has become so corrupt and rigid,

24
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:02,160
that free speech fragments it into its
parts so that it can rejuvenate itself.

25
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:05,670
And so mean the actually in the gospels,

26
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:06,451
that's the hero.

27
00:01:06,451 --> 00:01:08,760
That Christ is basically represented as,

28
00:01:08,761 --> 00:01:13,290
he's not so much the dragon confronting
the dragon slayer who gathers the

29
00:01:13,291 --> 00:01:13,681
treasure,

30
00:01:13,681 --> 00:01:15,480
although that's implicit in the,

31
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:19,800
in the juxtaposition of Christ with the
figure of like a serpent tile Satan.

32
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:24,900
But Christ is the thing that stands up
against the corrupt state and rejuvenated

33
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:25,800
through speech.

34
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:27,900
And so technically speaking,

35
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:29,191
free speech,

36
00:01:29,191 --> 00:01:32,160
the logos is the thing that
mediates between chaos and order.

37
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:34,650
And you can think about
this is represented in,

38
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:35,161
in,

39
00:01:35,161 --> 00:01:35,431
in,

40
00:01:35,431 --> 00:01:37,020
in many cultures this idea,

41
00:01:37,021 --> 00:01:41,630
you can see it most specifically I would
say in the Taoist conceptualization

42
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:45,660
because in the Dallas world being
is made out of chaos and order,

43
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:46,643
Yin and Yang,

44
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:47,910
masculine and feminine,

45
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,140
fundamentally it's chaos in order in
order is the fact that wherever you go

46
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,970
there are things you understand in order.

47
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:57,180
And Chaos is the fact that wherever
you go there are things you don't

48
00:01:57,181 --> 00:01:57,990
understand.

49
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:01,740
And so the idea is that being is made
out of the things that you understand and

50
00:02:01,741 --> 00:02:03,180
the things that you don't understand.

51
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:04,560
And it's always that way,

52
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:08,640
which is why dow is the
symbol of being per se.

53
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:09,660
And it's the case.

54
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,040
Your brain has adapted.

55
00:02:11,041 --> 00:02:11,581
In fact,

56
00:02:11,581 --> 00:02:15,360
it's partly why it has two hemispheres
for the world that you understand in the

57
00:02:15,361 --> 00:02:15,631
world.

58
00:02:15,631 --> 00:02:17,130
You don't understand the world.

59
00:02:17,131 --> 00:02:19,050
You understand roughly speaking,

60
00:02:19,051 --> 00:02:20,730
being handled by the left in the world.

61
00:02:20,731 --> 00:02:22,860
You don't understand roughly speaking,

62
00:02:22,861 --> 00:02:24,060
being handled by the right.

63
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:25,230
Well,

64
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:27,270
it's that line down the middle.

65
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:28,260
That's dao,

66
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:29,520
that's meaning.

67
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,250
And if you have one foot in
chaos and one foot in order,

68
00:02:32,251 --> 00:02:36,390
you're maximizing information flow and
rejuvenating yourself at the same time

69
00:02:36,391 --> 00:02:37,800
that you're maintaining your structure.

70
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:42,210
And you will report on that
internally as engagement in the world.

71
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:46,890
It's the most fundamental orienting
sense that you have and it's deeply

72
00:02:46,891 --> 00:02:48,570
instantiated neurologically,

73
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:49,920
unbelievably deeply.

74
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:55,170
And so it really is the case from an
evolutionary perspective that reality is

75
00:02:55,171 --> 00:02:56,130
chaos and order.

76
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,990
It's that to which you're adapted.

77
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:01,870
And so sometimes you're speaking on
behalf of chaos and sometimes you were

78
00:03:01,871 --> 00:03:03,010
speaking on behalf of border.

79
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:04,960
It's more complicated
than that too though.

80
00:03:04,961 --> 00:03:07,620
Because when we have a dialog say and,

81
00:03:07,621 --> 00:03:08,200
and we're,

82
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:12,760
we're mutually attempting to climb towards
the truth instead of convincing each

83
00:03:12,761 --> 00:03:13,810
other that we're right,

84
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:14,823
say,

85
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:17,670
then what we're doing is
engaging in the simile.

86
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:22,390
Tanium is fragmentation of old and archaic
belief systems and they're updated.

87
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:26,830
And you can experience that because
someone will say something that sets you

88
00:03:26,831 --> 00:03:29,980
back and then you'll get what they're
saying and it'll click together.

89
00:03:29,981 --> 00:03:32,140
And what you're experiencing
is the death of a,

90
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:32,801
of a,

91
00:03:32,801 --> 00:03:35,380
of an old conceptualization structure,

92
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:36,760
its disintegration,

93
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:39,280
and then it's
reconfiguration in a tighter,

94
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,690
in a tighter order.

95
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:42,160
And people love that.

96
00:03:42,161 --> 00:03:42,971
They live for that.

97
00:03:42,971 --> 00:03:43,171
It's,

98
00:03:43,171 --> 00:03:43,520
it's,

99
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,650
it's really,

100
00:03:44,651 --> 00:03:45,910
it's what keeps you alive.

101
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:48,400
And you can experience that
in a deep conversation,

102
00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:49,870
a truthful conversation,

103
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:51,760
a meeting of the minds and soul.

104
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:53,020
And people love that.

105
00:03:53,021 --> 00:03:53,854
It's curative.

106
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:58,930
All psychotherapists know this because
what you do in psychotherapy as well,

107
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:03,970
in addition to helping people face the
things that they're most afraid of so

108
00:04:03,971 --> 00:04:05,230
that they can overcome them,

109
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:08,290
is to allow them to
tell someone the truth.

110
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:10,480
What happened to you all?

111
00:04:10,481 --> 00:04:11,314
Listen.

112
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:15,580
So they tell you and they take themselves
apart and put themselves together.

113
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:16,061
Well,

114
00:04:16,061 --> 00:04:20,710
they're speaking the truth about what
happened and it puts them together.

115
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:21,800
It's at the no,

116
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:22,040
the,

117
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:26,680
the two fundamental elements
of psychotherapy are let's
find what you're afraid

118
00:04:26,681 --> 00:04:30,880
of an avoiding and help you confront it
so that you can gather the information

119
00:04:30,881 --> 00:04:35,881
that's there and let's allow you to lay
your story out in all of its catastrophe

120
00:04:36,731 --> 00:04:40,420
in detail so that you can straighten
yourself out through speech.

121
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,850
That's exactly what
happens in psychotherapy.

122
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:46,030
So when it should happen
in every real relationship,

123
00:04:46,031 --> 00:04:46,390
it's,

124
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:49,270
it's the spiritual purpose
of marriage fundamentally,

125
00:04:49,271 --> 00:04:49,511
right?

126
00:04:49,511 --> 00:04:53,380
Because you faced someone who's different
than you that you're tied to and

127
00:04:53,381 --> 00:04:54,790
cannot run from.

128
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:57,490
And so you can reveal your really,

129
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:57,881
really,

130
00:04:57,881 --> 00:04:58,750
it's a critical,

131
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:02,650
it's a critical part of marriage
because if you can run from someone,

132
00:05:02,651 --> 00:05:05,080
they will never show you their true face.

133
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:07,750
Because if someone shows
you their true face,

134
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:08,800
you will run.

135
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:11,440
And so you say in a marriage ceremony,

136
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:15,850
I will allow you to show me your
true face and I will not run.

137
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:19,540
And unless you mean that
you'll never be married,

138
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:23,770
you'll never understand what it means
and you'll never reap the benefits of it,

139
00:05:23,771 --> 00:05:25,150
which are practical,

140
00:05:25,151 --> 00:05:25,721
obviously,

141
00:05:25,721 --> 00:05:28,240
but also spiritual and psychological.

142
00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:30,160
There's a reason for the vow,

143
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:34,180
but it has to be a vow because otherwise
you have a back door open and you'll

144
00:05:34,181 --> 00:05:39,181
never really tell the person what your
life and no bloody wonder because really

145
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:41,050
who wants to know what you're like,

146
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:43,091
God,

147
00:05:43,091 --> 00:05:43,924
even you,

148
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:44,770
that's for sure.
