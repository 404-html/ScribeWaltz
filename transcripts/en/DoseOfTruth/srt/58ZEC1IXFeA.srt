1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:05,250
I've said that some people will tell you
that the purpose of life is to be happy

2
00:00:05,251 --> 00:00:09,300
and those people are idiots and
was a bit of a rough statement,

3
00:00:09,301 --> 00:00:10,800
but I what I meant by that.

4
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:15,920
It was actually inspired by a statement
by Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn who was the

5
00:00:15,991 --> 00:00:20,991
great critic of the Soviet prison system
and he commented that happiness is

6
00:00:21,421 --> 00:00:26,400
something that's done in by the first
harsh blow that reality deals you and I

7
00:00:26,401 --> 00:00:27,600
believe this to be the case.

8
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:32,790
There are many circumstances in life
where happiness is not only the wrong

9
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:33,893
response,

10
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:37,710
but also where the expectation
of happiness as a response.

11
00:00:37,711 --> 00:00:39,120
We'll put you,

12
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:43,500
the person attempting to be happy in
absolutely the wrong psychological state.

13
00:00:43,501 --> 00:00:45,330
To be prepared for what must be done.

14
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:48,060
People are built so to speak,

15
00:00:48,061 --> 00:00:53,061
to experience a very wide
range of motivational and
emotional states that only

16
00:00:53,311 --> 00:00:55,590
bear a tenuous relationship
to one another.

17
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:59,700
And the reason for that is
that the environment that
human beings inhabit is so

18
00:00:59,701 --> 00:01:04,701
complex that are adaptation depends on
a variety of very finally differentiated

19
00:01:05,731 --> 00:01:06,570
responses.

20
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:10,950
And so there is a time to be compassionate
and there's a time to be aggressive

21
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:15,330
and there's a time to be in pain and
there's a time to be anxious and there's a

22
00:01:15,331 --> 00:01:20,070
time to be joyous and a time to be
satisfied and the healthy and well adapted

23
00:01:20,071 --> 00:01:24,930
person has a very wide range of finally
differentiated response which cannot be

24
00:01:24,931 --> 00:01:27,780
boiled down to a single dimension.

25
00:01:27,781 --> 00:01:29,790
Say happiness versus unhappiness.

26
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:32,040
A life is not that simple.

27
00:01:32,041 --> 00:01:32,910
And if it was,

28
00:01:32,911 --> 00:01:34,680
we'd only have one emotional system.

29
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:36,393
Happiness.

30
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:38,410
All it is is it's a barometer.

31
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:40,230
It's Dr Phil One-on-one.

32
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:41,440
Dr Phil always asked,

33
00:01:41,441 --> 00:01:42,550
how are things working for you?

34
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:44,350
And if you say things are working well,

35
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:45,190
that's pretty.

36
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:47,290
That's pretty much what
we're meaning by happiness.

37
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:49,750
Happiness does not propel us forward.

38
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:53,110
So it's very weird to meet
the objective of your life.

39
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:58,470
And what I mean by that is
while I love being a father,

40
00:01:58,511 --> 00:01:58,870
I can,

41
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:01,990
I will tell you point blank
with my wife listening,

42
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:04,300
that it has not improved my happiness,

43
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:07,300
meaning and purpose in
life through the roof.

44
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:08,141
Happiness.

45
00:02:08,141 --> 00:02:12,910
I was much happier as a 30 year old having
a lot of time with friends and a lot

46
00:02:12,911 --> 00:02:16,660
of time to travel and a lot of time to
basically do whatever the hell that I

47
00:02:16,661 --> 00:02:17,494
wanted to,

48
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:20,650
so in terms of my happiness
is detracted from it.

49
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:25,600
Are there moments of the most
profound pleasure of the most profound

50
00:02:25,601 --> 00:02:30,601
spirituality that I would die for these
sacred vessels that I have in my life?

51
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:31,953
Absolutely,

52
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,430
but that's not happiness,

53
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:38,700
that's spirituality to me is striving
for the sacred and the sacred is things

54
00:02:38,831 --> 00:02:40,810
that you would be willing to die for.

55
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:41,381
What?

56
00:02:41,381 --> 00:02:44,590
I'd die for a sense of
satisfaction in my life.

57
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:45,460
No.

58
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:48,340
What would I be willing to
take the bullet over my kids?

59
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,360
Absolutely

60
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,540
making happiness.

61
00:02:51,541 --> 00:02:56,541
The focal point of your life trivializes
your experiences because in order to

62
00:02:57,661 --> 00:02:59,190
regard anything as truly,

63
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:03,550
you also have to regard it's
loss as truly meaningful,

64
00:03:03,551 --> 00:03:07,870
and that means that to open yourself
up to experiences of deep meaning also

65
00:03:07,871 --> 00:03:12,280
simultaneously means that you have to
open yourself up to the possibility of

66
00:03:12,281 --> 00:03:13,780
deep hurt and sorrow

67
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:20,150
and you do that anytime,

68
00:03:20,151 --> 00:03:20,721
for example,

69
00:03:20,721 --> 00:03:22,610
that you make a relationship profound.

70
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:26,360
You put your emotions on the line and
that has to be real or the relationship

71
00:03:26,361 --> 00:03:31,361
can't be real and to hope that that
sort of risk could be obliterated by the

72
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:38,010
indulgence in a simplistic
form of happiness is to shrink.

73
00:03:38,181 --> 00:03:42,800
I think in cowardess from the demands
that real human existence place on people.

74
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:51,560
This is ideas in Canada on CBC radio,

75
00:03:51,561 --> 00:03:55,250
one across North America
on Sirius Satellite Radio,

76
00:03:55,251 --> 00:03:59,180
Channel One 59 and around
the world on CBC dot Ca.

77
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:00,170
I'm Paul Kennedy.

78
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,920
You're listening to CBC,

79
00:04:01,921 --> 00:04:05,280
producer Frank Foulkes
say no to happiness.

80
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:10,730
The renowned psychiatrist
and concentration camp
survivor Viktor Frankl wrote

81
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:14,960
what man actually needs is
not attention list state,

82
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:20,320
but rather the striving and struggling
for a worthwhile goal of freely chosen

83
00:04:20,511 --> 00:04:21,344
task.

84
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:24,080
There is much wisdom in
the words of Nietzsche.

85
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:26,720
He has a why to live,

86
00:04:26,721 --> 00:04:29,450
for can bear almost anyhow.

87
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:32,450
We now return to frank's documentary,

88
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,920
say no to happiness

89
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:40,800
at every moment.

90
00:04:40,801 --> 00:04:43,860
We're surrounded by what
we know and can understand,

91
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:45,180
but outside of that,

92
00:04:45,181 --> 00:04:48,660
we're surrounded by all the things that
we do not know and cannot understand and

93
00:04:48,661 --> 00:04:50,700
that can manifest
themselves at any moment.

94
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:56,150
So we're like small islands of
tentative certainty and a massive sea of

95
00:04:58,081 --> 00:04:59,400
uncertainty in ignorance.

96
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:03,990
That's our existential condition.

97
00:05:03,991 --> 00:05:05,670
It's really our environment.

98
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:07,530
Even from a scientific perspective.

99
00:05:07,531 --> 00:05:12,531
It's the environment that we've emerged
into and have adapted to and we have to

100
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:17,370
take that into account when we deal
with our lives because that's the truest

101
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,390
nature of our life.

102
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:21,450
It's ordering the midst of infinite chaos.

103
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:27,050
The human problem is how to make sense
out of the constant investor play between

104
00:05:27,051 --> 00:05:29,810
that tentative order
in that infinite chaos.

105
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:34,660
Jordan Peterson is a professor of
psychology at the University of Toronto.

106
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:37,450
He is also the author of maps of meaning,

107
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:38,980
the architecture of belief.

108
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:44,080
His book explores how religious and
mythological stories shed light on our

109
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:48,970
existential predicament and in turn can
provide a sense of meaning and purpose.

110
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,700
In the Old Testament in genesis,

111
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:54,970
it's one of the most profound
ideas ever expressed.

112
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:57,010
The Old Testament God in

113
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:01,940
generates order out of
chaos and upon doing so,

114
00:06:01,941 --> 00:06:02,774
he states,

115
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:05,600
man and woman are made in my image.

116
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:07,250
What does he mean by that?

117
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:08,271
Well,

118
00:06:08,271 --> 00:06:10,610
he dignifies the human
soul with that statement,

119
00:06:10,611 --> 00:06:15,611
but the attribution of dignity is based
on a psychological and an ontological

120
00:06:16,551 --> 00:06:21,551
reality and that reality is that what
the individual consciousness confronts is

121
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:27,440
equivalent in some sense to the chaos
that God originally turned into order at

122
00:06:28,131 --> 00:06:29,060
the beginning of time.

123
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:34,010
In that what you confront moment to
moment is the potential of being.

124
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:36,020
That's what consciousness does.

125
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:41,290
It takes unformed potential and makes
it manifest and each human being has the

126
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:46,540
choice about which direction that
potential will manifest itself in,

127
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:50,840
but not about whether or not that
manifestation will take place.

128
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:56,050
Because it takes place no matter what
and that's why the moral obligation of

129
00:06:56,151 --> 00:06:58,460
existence is incumbent on our being.

130
00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:08,370
Existence implies coexistence to be is
to be involved with the life of others.

131
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:15,270
We delude ourselves if we think that
we're simply innocent bystanders and life

132
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:17,680
being is never neutral.

133
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:19,870
What we do matters.

134
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:25,980
You can be a creator of things positive
or you can be a creator of things

135
00:07:26,621 --> 00:07:30,790
negative or you can be a creator
who abdicated their responsibility,

136
00:07:30,791 --> 00:07:32,500
but in all three situations,

137
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:38,220
you are participating in the process that
turns chaos into order and there is no

138
00:07:38,471 --> 00:07:39,304
escaping that.

139
00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:44,750
When the high school kids,

140
00:07:44,751 --> 00:07:48,620
the chart up columbine wrote
about their philosophy and

141
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:54,440
the most telling aspect of
their philosophy was their
judgment of exist in state

142
00:07:55,381 --> 00:07:55,920
and they did.

143
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,120
You can read this on the net.

144
00:07:57,540 --> 00:08:02,540
Their conclusion at the great age of 19
was that the tragedy of existence was

145
00:08:04,621 --> 00:08:08,280
such that being itself was corrupt.

146
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:12,930
That because people suffered and
because of the world was a dangerous and

147
00:08:12,931 --> 00:08:13,770
terrible place.

148
00:08:14,010 --> 00:08:17,730
That being itself should be eradicated
and this is a very common judgment,

149
00:08:17,731 --> 00:08:19,410
is far more common than people think.

150
00:08:20,010 --> 00:08:25,010
And once you forego the luxury of deciding
in a sense to hell with everything

151
00:08:28,231 --> 00:08:32,160
that that everything is so
corrupt that it's unredeemable,

152
00:08:32,161 --> 00:08:33,600
once you forego that luxury,

153
00:08:33,601 --> 00:08:38,601
then it becomes incumbent on you to try
to work for the betterment of being in

154
00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:43,200
that requires faith and and the
reason it requires faith is because a,

155
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:45,600
you don't know if being can be bettered,

156
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:46,493
and B,

157
00:08:46,530 --> 00:08:48,600
you don't know if you're
the creature to do it,

158
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:52,890
but the peculiar thing is is that you
will never find out if being can be

159
00:08:52,891 --> 00:08:55,020
bettered or if you're
the creature to do it,

160
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:56,160
until you assume

161
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:59,640
that it can be bettered and you assume
that you are that creature to do it.

162
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:03,900
Critics of religious thinking believed
that what faith means is the willingness

163
00:09:03,901 --> 00:09:08,070
to suspend rational judgment
and swallow any old thing.

164
00:09:08,071 --> 00:09:10,110
No matter how absurd.

165
00:09:10,111 --> 00:09:11,850
And that's not what faith means at all.

166
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:16,880
What faith means is the willingness to
put yourself on the line in pursuit of

167
00:09:17,011 --> 00:09:19,320
those things that you
find deeply meaningful.

168
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:23,700
And that's why so many great philosophers
such as Soren kierkegaard emphasize

169
00:09:23,701 --> 00:09:26,430
above all the role that faith plays.

170
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:38,620
I'm a clinical psychologist.

171
00:09:38,621 --> 00:09:39,890
I have an active practice,

172
00:09:40,210 --> 00:09:45,210
20 clients and I see them weekly and
I'm a professor of psychology at the

173
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:48,460
University of Toronto and so it might
be surprising that I use religious

174
00:09:48,461 --> 00:09:48,881
language,

175
00:09:48,881 --> 00:09:53,881
but it's not surprising because as soon
as you start to talk about the deepest

176
00:09:54,130 --> 00:09:55,300
meanings of life,

177
00:09:56,380 --> 00:10:00,370
the language that is most appropriate
is immediately religious and the reason

178
00:10:00,371 --> 00:10:05,170
for that is that religion is precisely
that element of human existence that

179
00:10:05,171 --> 00:10:08,530
deals with the most profound
elements of human being.

180
00:10:12,050 --> 00:10:14,630
I believe that the
reason for this is this,

181
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,280
in some sense,

182
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:21,580
human existence is so contradictory
that it's in in a manner technically

183
00:10:22,041 --> 00:10:22,874
impossible.

184
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:28,240
We're limited creatures and
we face unlimited catastrophe
in in that everything

185
00:10:28,911 --> 00:10:32,300
we know will disappear and
everyone we love will die.

186
00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:35,810
And so that makes existence.

187
00:10:35,811 --> 00:10:38,570
Human existence in a sense
existentially impossible,

188
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:43,840
but the religious impulse combats that
in a sense because the religious impulse

189
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:49,810
opens up to the human being
the possibility that there
is sufficient absolute

190
00:10:50,001 --> 00:10:55,001
within to serve as an antidote to the
absolute without and the notion that it's

191
00:10:57,081 --> 00:11:00,350
necessary to have an individual
relationship with the absolute.

192
00:11:00,351 --> 00:11:00,891
With God,

193
00:11:00,891 --> 00:11:01,551
for example,

194
00:11:01,551 --> 00:11:06,551
is a statement of the fact that we are
in fact adapted to the nature of reality,

195
00:11:07,461 --> 00:11:11,660
and if we draw on everything that
is within ourselves without fear,

196
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:16,400
then we can develop the sorts of
personalities that are powerful enough to

197
00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:21,430
confront the horrible absolute and to
consider that justifiable and worthwhile.

198
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:33,460
I want to put it in a good word
coming from the Jewish tradition,

199
00:11:33,461 --> 00:11:35,170
a good word for happiness.

200
00:11:35,171 --> 00:11:35,460
It's,

201
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:35,690
it's,

202
00:11:35,690 --> 00:11:40,390
it's striking to me that the very first
word in the first verse of the First

203
00:11:40,391 --> 00:11:44,650
Chapter of the Book of Psalms is a word
that is probably best translated as

204
00:11:44,651 --> 00:11:45,220
happy,

205
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:49,720
so it says in Psalms happy is the one
who does not stand in the way of the

206
00:11:49,721 --> 00:11:54,721
wicked or walk with sinners or sit in the
company of but whose delight is in the

207
00:11:55,151 --> 00:11:57,910
law of the Lord in God's law.

208
00:11:57,911 --> 00:11:59,380
Does he meditate day and night?

209
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:01,040
Happiness is a,

210
00:12:01,041 --> 00:12:03,070
I think a not a bad thing.

211
00:12:03,071 --> 00:12:05,170
It's certainly better than its opposite,

212
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:05,860
but,

213
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:09,670
but clearly it is inadequate
as a goal for our lives.

214
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:11,500
If that's all that we can aspire to,

215
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:13,750
then our lives to become trivial,

216
00:12:13,751 --> 00:12:15,310
then they become insignificant.

217
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:20,170
The happiest creature in the world I
think is a lizard sitting in the sun,

218
00:12:20,530 --> 00:12:23,140
and if all we want to be or
lizards sitting in the sun,

219
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:27,640
it won't work for us because we have
an awareness that lizards don't have.

220
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:31,000
We have an awareness that there is
something greater than ourselves,

221
00:12:31,001 --> 00:12:32,110
greater than our material,

222
00:12:32,111 --> 00:12:34,690
corporeal being that
there is the infinite.

223
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:38,920
Dan Polish is the author
of talking about God,

224
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:44,220
exploring the meaning of religious life
with regard boober Tillich and Heschel

225
00:12:46,090 --> 00:12:46,810
in his book,

226
00:12:46,810 --> 00:12:47,890
Polish explorers.

227
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:53,040
How each of these thinkers understand
the human encounter with the infinite.

228
00:12:54,370 --> 00:12:58,990
The Danish Christian philosopher Soren
Kierkegaard coined the term anxious or

229
00:12:58,991 --> 00:13:03,991
anxiety to describe our experience
as limited beings overwhelmed by the

230
00:13:04,721 --> 00:13:05,554
infinite.

231
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:06,760
Paul Tillich,

232
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:11,380
a Christian theologian talked about
the courage to be in the face of our

233
00:13:11,381 --> 00:13:12,670
existential predicament.

234
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:14,440
The Jewish theologian,

235
00:13:14,441 --> 00:13:18,550
Martin Buber talked about the importance
of holding ourselves open to the

236
00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:23,170
unconditional mystery that we
encounter in every sphere of our life.

237
00:13:23,830 --> 00:13:28,830
Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel spoke
of knowing life has ultimate meaning.

238
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:32,650
Though we can never fully comprehend
that meaning only sense it,

239
00:13:33,490 --> 00:13:36,850
all of them could be characterized
is existentialist thinkers,

240
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:42,240
by which I mean that they like other
existentialists recognize that as

241
00:13:42,731 --> 00:13:43,421
Shakespeare said,

242
00:13:43,421 --> 00:13:46,330
there's more in heaven and earth than
there is in your philosophy of ratio.

243
00:13:46,810 --> 00:13:48,640
They don't focus on creating theories.

244
00:13:48,641 --> 00:13:52,810
They know that the mind can go only so
far so they don't start with theory.

245
00:13:52,811 --> 00:13:56,170
They start with a with human
experience it religiously.

246
00:13:56,171 --> 00:14:01,171
That means that they are less interested
in talking about what God is a then it

247
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:07,790
talking about how we human beings respond
to God rather than trying to define

248
00:14:07,811 --> 00:14:12,600
that which they recognize ultimately as
beyond the capacity for human beings do

249
00:14:12,610 --> 00:14:17,610
either define or even understand and
that unless we find a way of living

250
00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:22,660
constructively with the infinite
are living in the infinite.

251
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:27,790
Unless we find the courage to have
faith in that which we cannot begin to

252
00:14:27,791 --> 00:14:29,980
understand or begin to articulate a,

253
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:33,280
then we're then we're going to suffer
what kierkegaard called [inaudible].

254
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:34,990
We're going to suffer that anxiety.

255
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:39,460
Character guard by all accounts
was not a happy fellow.

256
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:44,350
He suffered a major
romantic disappointment as
a young man and eventually

257
00:14:44,351 --> 00:14:49,351
retreated into a solitary life of study
and writing when it came to achieving

258
00:14:49,931 --> 00:14:51,070
happiness in this life.

259
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:51,980
He didn't

260
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:53,210
believe it was possible.

261
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:58,960
The best we can do is aspire to
diminish the anx that defines human

262
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:00,483
existence.

263
00:15:01,270 --> 00:15:02,230
As for the other three,

264
00:15:02,231 --> 00:15:06,220
the who lived in the 20th century
that that I've written about his show,

265
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:07,213
Uber Tilak,

266
00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:12,630
all three of them knew a great deal of
suffering in their lives so that the idea

267
00:15:13,571 --> 00:15:15,430
of happiness being something paramount,

268
00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:17,380
I think we'd look ridiculous to them.

269
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:22,680
All three of them were forced to leave
Germany and Europe when it fell under

270
00:15:24,191 --> 00:15:25,690
Nazi domination.

271
00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:26,680
Heschel,

272
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:27,490
of course,

273
00:15:27,490 --> 00:15:32,490
came to the United States before the
full horrors of the Nazi reality acted

274
00:15:33,221 --> 00:15:35,020
itself out in Europe.

275
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,030
He was living in Cincinnati,

276
00:15:37,031 --> 00:15:41,890
Ohio when he got word that his
whole family had been exterminated.

277
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:48,100
I've said that some people will tell you
that the purpose of life is to be happy

278
00:15:48,241 --> 00:15:49,890
and those people are idiots,

279
00:15:49,891 --> 00:15:52,290
and it was a bit of a rough statement,

280
00:15:52,291 --> 00:15:52,830
but I.

281
00:15:52,830 --> 00:15:53,820
What I meant by that,

282
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:58,910
it was actually inspired by a statement
by Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn who was the

283
00:15:58,981 --> 00:16:03,981
great critic of the Soviet prison system
and he commented that happiness is

284
00:16:04,441 --> 00:16:09,090
something that's done in by the first
harsh blow that reality deals you and and

285
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:10,620
and I believe this to be the case.

286
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:15,780
There are many circumstances in life
where happiness is not only the wrong

287
00:16:16,051 --> 00:16:16,890
response,

288
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:20,700
but also where the expectation
of happiness as a response.

289
00:16:20,701 --> 00:16:22,140
We'll put you,

290
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:26,490
the person attempting to be happy in
absolutely the wrong psychological state.

291
00:16:26,491 --> 00:16:28,320
To be prepared for what must be done.

292
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:31,050
People are built so to speak,

293
00:16:31,051 --> 00:16:36,051
to experience a very wide
range of motivational and
emotional states that only

294
00:16:36,301 --> 00:16:38,610
bear a tenuous relationship
to one another.

295
00:16:38,610 --> 00:16:42,690
And the reason for that is
that the environment that
human beings inhabit is so

296
00:16:42,691 --> 00:16:47,691
complex that are app patient depends on
a variety of very finally differentiated

297
00:16:48,751 --> 00:16:49,584
responses.

298
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:54,000
And so there is a time to be compassionate
and there's a time to be aggressive

299
00:16:54,001 --> 00:16:58,320
and there's a time to be in pain and
there's a time to be anxious and there's a

300
00:16:58,321 --> 00:17:03,321
time to be joyous and a time
to be satisfied and healthy
and well adapted person

301
00:17:03,541 --> 00:17:08,340
has a very wide range of
finally differentiated
response which cannot be boiled

302
00:17:08,341 --> 00:17:10,770
down to a single dimension.

303
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,780
Say happiness versus unhappiness.

304
00:17:13,290 --> 00:17:15,040
A life is not that simple.

305
00:17:15,330 --> 00:17:15,901
If it was,

306
00:17:15,901 --> 00:17:17,670
we'd only have one emotional system.

307
00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:19,383
Happiness.

308
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:21,430
All it is is it's a barometer.

309
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,250
It's Dr Phil One-on-one.

310
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:24,450
Dr Phil always asked,

311
00:17:24,451 --> 00:17:25,570
how are things working for you?

312
00:17:25,930 --> 00:17:27,340
And if you say things are working well,

313
00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:28,130
that's pretty.

314
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:30,280
That's pretty much what
we mean by happiness.

315
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:32,740
Happiness does not propel us forward.

316
00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:34,690
So it's very weird to meet this,

317
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,100
the objective of your life.

318
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:41,490
And what I mean by that is
while I love being a father,

319
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:45,010
I will tell you point blank
with my wife listening,

320
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:47,320
that it has not improved my happiness,

321
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:50,310
meaning and purpose in
life through the roof.

322
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:51,121
Happiness.

323
00:17:51,121 --> 00:17:55,920
I was much happier as a 30 year old having
a lot of time with friends and a lot

324
00:17:55,921 --> 00:17:59,670
of time to travel and a lot of time to
basically do whatever the hell that I

325
00:17:59,671 --> 00:18:00,504
wanted to,

326
00:18:00,930 --> 00:18:02,430
so in terms of my happiness,

327
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:03,660
it's detracted from it.

328
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:08,610
Are there moments of the most
profound pleasure of the most profound

329
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:13,620
spirituality that I would die for these
sacred vessels that I have in my life?

330
00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:14,963
Absolutely,

331
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:16,440
but that's not happiness,

332
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:21,710
that's spirituality to me is striving
for the sacred and the secret is things

333
00:18:21,811 --> 00:18:26,811
that you would be willing to die for
what I die for a sense of satisfaction in

334
00:18:27,181 --> 00:18:27,630
my life.

335
00:18:27,630 --> 00:18:28,440
No,

336
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:31,320
what would I be willing to
take the bullet over my kids?

337
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:32,340
Absolutely

338
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,510
making happiness.

339
00:18:34,511 --> 00:18:39,511
The focal point of your life trivializes
your experiences because in order to

340
00:18:40,661 --> 00:18:42,880
regard anything as truly important,

341
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:46,540
you also have to regard it's
loss as truly meaningful,

342
00:18:46,541 --> 00:18:50,890
and that means that to open yourself
up to experiences of deep meaning also

343
00:18:50,891 --> 00:18:55,270
simultaneously means that you have to
open yourself up to the possibility of

344
00:18:55,271 --> 00:18:56,800
deep hurt and sorrow

345
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:03,150
and you do that anytime,

346
00:19:03,151 --> 00:19:03,721
for example,

347
00:19:03,721 --> 00:19:05,610
that you make a relationship profound.

348
00:19:05,670 --> 00:19:09,330
You put your emotions on the line and
that has to be real or the relationship

349
00:19:09,331 --> 00:19:14,331
can't be real and to hope that that
sort of risk could be obliterated by the

350
00:19:16,051 --> 00:19:21,051
indulgence in a simplistic
form of happiness is to shrink.

351
00:19:21,181 --> 00:19:25,860
I think in cowardess from the demands
that real human existence place on people.

352
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:34,550
This is ideas in Canada on CBC radio,

353
00:19:34,551 --> 00:19:39,551
one across North America
on Sirius Satellite Radio
Channel One 59 and around the

354
00:19:40,281 --> 00:19:42,170
world on CBC dot Ca.

355
00:19:42,290 --> 00:19:43,190
I'm Paul Kennedy.

356
00:19:43,610 --> 00:19:44,930
You're listening to CBC,

357
00:19:44,931 --> 00:19:48,320
producer Frank fulks say no to happiness.

358
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,450
The renowned psychiatrist in
concentration camp survivor,

359
00:19:52,451 --> 00:19:57,320
Viktor Frankl wrote what man
actually needs is not a tension

360
00:19:57,470 --> 00:20:02,470
duration of for us to live in ways
that transcend simple selfishness,

361
00:20:04,490 --> 00:20:06,020
simple egocentricity,

362
00:20:06,021 --> 00:20:07,700
simple focusing on ourselves.

363
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,910
Ryan hold neighbor who was actually
a very close friend of Heschel,

364
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:16,240
said that life has no meaning
except in terms of responsibility.

365
00:20:16,670 --> 00:20:19,460
I'm sure how she would he would
shake his head absolutely.

366
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:29,900
One of Heschel's earliest books is
called the image of God in this world.

367
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:31,193
Humanity.

368
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:34,200
Human beings are God's
image in this world.

369
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:40,220
Our goal in life is very clear to be in
this world what we would want God to be

370
00:20:40,291 --> 00:20:41,124
in this world,

371
00:20:46,170 --> 00:20:51,170
for us to our actions and our
behaviors and our engagements,

372
00:20:51,610 --> 00:20:53,830
to manifest God in the world,

373
00:20:55,770 --> 00:20:59,730
to be radically discontent with the
things that exist in this world,

374
00:20:59,731 --> 00:21:03,990
to be radically discontent with the
social evils that we see around us.

375
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,810
Do what we can to write them

376
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:14,630
because we are God's own self
is at work in this world,

377
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:21,090
which actually would say means where
we finally become the most human.

378
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:40,140
I've gotten very interested
in the psychology of morality
because we often push

379
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:44,800
it aside to just religious teachings,

380
00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:45,820
religious ideas,

381
00:21:45,821 --> 00:21:48,820
and when we're making moral
decisions on a daily basis,

382
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:53,680
and it makes me think of exemplars of
people that have profound meaning and

383
00:21:53,681 --> 00:21:54,520
purpose in life,

384
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:59,830
but are probably average to below average
on happiness and Martin Luther King

385
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:02,620
happens to be a real
great example of this.

386
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:07,870
Todd Cashton is associate professor of
psychology at George Mason University in

387
00:22:07,871 --> 00:22:08,704
Virginia.

388
00:22:08,890 --> 00:22:12,280
He is the author of designing
positive psychology,

389
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:14,680
a book on the science of wellbeing.

390
00:22:15,190 --> 00:22:19,750
Professor cashton regularly gives
talks and workshops on how to live a

391
00:22:19,751 --> 00:22:22,060
worthwhile and meaningful life.

392
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:27,600
This is someone in context who
had extreme righteous indignation.

393
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:30,221
This is a,

394
00:22:30,221 --> 00:22:32,350
this is just a manifestation of anger,

395
00:22:32,770 --> 00:22:34,420
of the mistreatment of other,

396
00:22:34,450 --> 00:22:38,110
of other fellow human beings on
the lack of equality and fairness.

397
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:42,670
These are fundamental moral principles
and his life was devoted to this.

398
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:43,360
Um,

399
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:48,360
if you're talking about pursuing goals
that are outside the parameters of

400
00:22:49,781 --> 00:22:50,614
happiness,

401
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,240
look to Martin Luther King,

402
00:22:52,690 --> 00:22:57,160
the idea of absorbing the blues,

403
00:22:57,340 --> 00:22:58,180
the hatred,

404
00:22:58,510 --> 00:22:59,343
the prejudice,

405
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:03,970
the discrimination for other
people to make a point that these,

406
00:23:04,270 --> 00:23:09,270
these behaviors are not indicative
of what a good society is built on,

407
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:12,910
and Martin Luther King
is not the only person.

408
00:23:12,911 --> 00:23:15,790
He just happens to be a public exemplar.

409
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:20,470
You have people in schools right here in
DC where I'm sitting right now who are

410
00:23:20,471 --> 00:23:22,660
devoting themselves in inner city kids.

411
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:26,920
You've got teachers that are
creating a safe space for them,

412
00:23:27,370 --> 00:23:31,660
a place where they can actually learn
and grow and become a moral outstanding

413
00:23:31,661 --> 00:23:32,494
citizen.

414
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:37,560
We're talking about people that are taking
time away from their own happiness to

415
00:23:37,901 --> 00:23:42,340
do something that really matters
and but lead to a sense of morality,

416
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:44,650
meaning and purpose in life.

417
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:47,210
They just don't fit on the same spectrum.

418
00:23:47,450 --> 00:23:47,601
Now,

419
00:23:47,601 --> 00:23:52,601
there are multiple pathways to living a
good life and I think a better approach

420
00:23:52,730 --> 00:23:57,650
than having happiness as the ultimate
end point is to do things you care about.

421
00:23:58,010 --> 00:23:59,450
We're not talking about happiness.

422
00:23:59,451 --> 00:24:01,040
We're talking about engagement.

423
00:24:01,310 --> 00:24:03,170
We're talking about meaningful pursuits.

424
00:24:03,910 --> 00:24:08,910
Nothing can drive you to find the
deepest meanings of life without first

425
00:24:10,541 --> 00:24:15,280
realizing the absolute fragility of
life because there's nothing that's

426
00:24:15,281 --> 00:24:20,281
sufficiently terrifying as realization
of that absolute fragility and it's

427
00:24:21,011 --> 00:24:26,011
necessary to be profoundly terrified
before you can be motivated to seek out

428
00:24:27,310 --> 00:24:31,750
those things that are of the highest value
as a consequence of considering these

429
00:24:31,751 --> 00:24:36,751
ideas for many years and especially
considering the role that evil has played,

430
00:24:37,031 --> 00:24:40,570
say in the 20th century and also the
role that suffering plays in life.

431
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:46,230
I've asked myself deeply what the purpose
of life might be and and it seems to

432
00:24:46,841 --> 00:24:51,340
me that life requires virtue
and so then you might ask,

433
00:24:51,341 --> 00:24:51,521
well,

434
00:24:51,521 --> 00:24:52,930
what do I mean by virtue?

435
00:24:52,931 --> 00:24:57,931
And what I mean by virtue is following
whatever it is in your life that

436
00:24:59,621 --> 00:25:03,730
manifests itself to you
as meaningful and right.

437
00:25:04,330 --> 00:25:06,550
And there's quota sales to that.

438
00:25:06,551 --> 00:25:07,241
For example,

439
00:25:07,241 --> 00:25:09,820
in order to determine clearly
what's meaningful and right,

440
00:25:09,821 --> 00:25:13,600
you have to stop light because if you
lie to yourself or you lie to other

441
00:25:13,601 --> 00:25:14,434
people,

442
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:19,000
you blind yourself and then the things
that might appear to you as meaningful

443
00:25:19,001 --> 00:25:23,200
are no longer trustworthy because
you're using an instrument that you

444
00:25:23,201 --> 00:25:28,201
voluntarily damaged to perceive reality
and that will lead you astray and virtue

445
00:25:28,601 --> 00:25:33,601
requires well requires humility because
you have to stop thinking that you know,

446
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:37,900
and so humility and honesty
are absolute preconditions.

447
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:41,950
Courage as well as necessary because
you will have to learn to come to terms

448
00:25:41,951 --> 00:25:46,540
with your own capacity for anxiety and
dread and aggression and the and even

449
00:25:46,541 --> 00:25:48,780
your capacity for welfare,

450
00:25:48,790 --> 00:25:49,840
terrible acts,

451
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:55,260
and to continually set yourself right
is to walk down the path I believe of

452
00:25:55,631 --> 00:25:56,464
moral virtue.

453
00:25:57,170 --> 00:26:02,170
I would contrast the difference between
having happiness as a desirable thing,

454
00:26:02,511 --> 00:26:04,970
which it's incredibly
desirable to be happy,

455
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:10,240
but what I like to talk about is
thinking about this as a compass provided

456
00:26:11,051 --> 00:26:13,400
navigator of which direction to go into.

457
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:15,650
It doesn't tell them
what direction it says,

458
00:26:15,651 --> 00:26:17,120
here's the direction that you're facing.

459
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:22,280
If happiness is your compass to
navigate through the complexities and

460
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:23,810
ambiguities of life,

461
00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:28,490
it means when something is
negative or problematic,

462
00:26:28,850 --> 00:26:30,740
that's the wrong direction to move into.

463
00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:34,850
When it's your values become your compass,

464
00:26:35,030 --> 00:26:35,990
it's very different.

465
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:37,310
Let me give you example,

466
00:26:37,311 --> 00:26:38,900
so one of my fundamental values,

467
00:26:38,901 --> 00:26:41,000
I have twin four year old girls,

468
00:26:41,150 --> 00:26:45,630
is to try to be a good father and
instill good values in them and try to

469
00:26:45,631 --> 00:26:49,650
cultivate their strikes and so
when I'm faced with conflicts,

470
00:26:49,651 --> 00:26:51,120
which we all are faced with,

471
00:26:52,410 --> 00:26:53,310
I love writing.

472
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,660
I love doing science.

473
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:58,140
I loved teaching and I'm in the
middle of a great writing session.

474
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:58,951
Eight hours,

475
00:26:58,951 --> 00:27:03,090
I'm in flow of the words
were just spilling out of
my brain onto the page and I

476
00:27:03,091 --> 00:27:05,880
look at the clock and I realized
it's almost time for their bedtime.

477
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:07,440
I've got a conflict here.

478
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:12,090
Do I continue with this incredible writing
session or do I make sure I've seen

479
00:27:12,091 --> 00:27:13,770
my kids before I go to sleep,

480
00:27:14,310 --> 00:27:15,300
read them a story,

481
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:16,313
tuck them in,

482
00:27:16,770 --> 00:27:17,940
showed them some affection,

483
00:27:17,941 --> 00:27:19,110
and maybe come back to this.

484
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:19,681
Am I writing?

485
00:27:19,681 --> 00:27:24,330
Might not be as good afterwards knowing
that my values are to trying to be a

486
00:27:24,331 --> 00:27:29,331
good father and instill values in them
helps me with the decision and it helps

487
00:27:29,821 --> 00:27:31,440
them decide if know what
I'm going to go home,

488
00:27:32,490 --> 00:27:33,780
spend some time with my children,

489
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:35,190
come back to my work.

490
00:27:35,430 --> 00:27:37,230
If happiness is my objective,

491
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:42,500
it leaves me in a much bigger quandary
of all of these conflicts of what do I do

492
00:27:42,661 --> 00:27:46,880
with the limited amount of time and
energy I have in any given day and all of

493
00:27:46,881 --> 00:27:50,070
these competing things that
are fighting for my attention,

494
00:27:50,550 --> 00:27:55,500
meaning and purpose in life and
values is a very stable compass.

495
00:27:55,890 --> 00:27:57,540
This is a way to create a life,

496
00:27:57,541 --> 00:27:59,730
to feel good about who we are,

497
00:28:00,150 --> 00:28:04,710
to have an understanding of what type
of person we want to be and try to close

498
00:28:04,711 --> 00:28:07,830
the gap between what we do
and what we strive to become.

499
00:28:08,490 --> 00:28:13,380
I want to make my personal signature
on my work so that I leave the world a

500
00:28:13,381 --> 00:28:14,820
little bit of a better place.

501
00:28:15,250 --> 00:28:18,070
Yeah.

502
00:28:24,810 --> 00:28:27,570
There's an old idea of deeply embedded,

503
00:28:27,571 --> 00:28:32,340
again in western religious thinking
that reality is in some sense,

504
00:28:32,341 --> 00:28:33,174
incomplete,

505
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:34,890
unfinished or broken,

506
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:39,300
and that the role of the
human being is to complete it,

507
00:28:39,301 --> 00:28:40,140
to perfect it,

508
00:28:40,230 --> 00:28:45,230
to finish it and see the idea that reality
is in some sense unfinished and hence

509
00:28:47,131 --> 00:28:49,320
it's tragic and incomplete manner,

510
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:54,150
and that the role of the human being
is in some sense to participate in its

511
00:28:54,151 --> 00:28:59,151
perfection is a concept
that is so profound that it
makes happiness as a concept

512
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:07,580
designed to encapsulate the meaning of
life so shallow that it instantly becomes

513
00:29:07,771 --> 00:29:08,940
virtually negligible.

514
00:29:14,710 --> 00:29:19,710
We have a hypothesis here that the
purpose of conscious being is for those

515
00:29:20,891 --> 00:29:25,330
beings who are conscious to transcend
their mortal limitations and to work for

516
00:29:25,331 --> 00:29:30,331
the perfection of all that exists
as a goal that justifies suffering.

517
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:32,350
That's unbeatable.

518
00:29:32,351 --> 00:29:37,351
I think because what it does is broaden
and deepen your life in a manner that

519
00:29:37,961 --> 00:29:40,900
you might compare to the
difference between elevator music.

520
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:42,430
A Beethoven symphony.

521
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:48,000
It's not that the symphony is in
any sense happier than the Muzak,

522
00:29:48,761 --> 00:29:50,200
and in fact quite the contrary,

523
00:29:50,201 --> 00:29:51,790
but it's deeper and more profound.

524
00:29:51,791 --> 00:29:56,791
Enricher and incorporates more and
justifies itself more and that's the right

525
00:29:57,341 --> 00:29:58,600
metaphor for life,

526
00:29:58,630 --> 00:29:59,620
not happiness,

527
00:29:59,621 --> 00:30:00,220
but,

528
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:01,960
but depth and and,

529
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:07,020
and differentiated quality and
profundity to match the profundity of the

530
00:30:07,241 --> 00:30:08,530
necessity of suffering.
