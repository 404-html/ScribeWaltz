1
00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:08,810
David Jackson.

2
00:00:08,811 --> 00:00:11,690
What are your thoughts on
Sophia citizenship status?

3
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:12,710
That's the robot.

4
00:00:12,711 --> 00:00:14,210
I believe that the Saudi,

5
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:17,570
the Saudi Arabians made
into a citizen here.

6
00:00:17,571 --> 00:00:18,620
I've got a thought.

7
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:22,310
Wouldn't it be nice if the Saudis
actually let their women be citizens?

8
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:22,971
That's what I,

9
00:00:22,971 --> 00:00:24,080
that's my thoughts.

10
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:28,490
So I don't think that the rest of the
world is in any position to take any

11
00:00:28,491 --> 00:00:29,930
lessons on what whatsoever,

12
00:00:29,931 --> 00:00:32,600
on what constitutes
citizenship from the Saudis.

13
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:34,220
That's my feeling about that.

14
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:35,120
I'm not,

15
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:37,940
I'm not a fan of Saudi Arabian culture.

16
00:00:37,941 --> 00:00:39,950
I'm not a fan of the way
that they treat their women.

17
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:44,150
I'm not a fan of the way
that they disseminate Wahhabi
propaganda into the west.

18
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:46,040
I'm not a fan of the way that they,

19
00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:47,690
they despise work.

20
00:00:47,691 --> 00:00:48,010
And,

21
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:52,280
and I'm not a fan of the Saudi
Arabians and the fact that they,

22
00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:57,610
granted Sophia citizenship status is a
publicity stunt of the worst form as far

23
00:00:57,771 --> 00:00:58,604
as I'm concerned.

24
00:00:59,270 --> 00:00:59,720
So.
