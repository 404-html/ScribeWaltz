1
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:10,540
Masculine masculinity is tyranny,

2
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:13,990
but the right amount is order
and too much femininity is chaos,

3
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:17,920
which is the word for the
right amount of femininity.

4
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:19,630
That's a really good question.

5
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:23,590
I read that a bit earlier and I couldn't
come up with something immediate,

6
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:29,160
but the only thing I can think of
is that often femininity has been

7
00:00:30,131 --> 00:00:35,131
characterized as wisdom
and maybe that's so,

8
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:36,870
so the,

9
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:41,970
the wisdom that God in the Judeo
Christian tradition that God consults is

10
00:00:42,851 --> 00:00:43,684
feminine.

11
00:00:43,690 --> 00:00:48,690
That's an old tradition and maybe that's
because order needs to be leaving with

12
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:55,150
the right amount of chaos in order
for wisdom to emerge the order,

13
00:00:55,151 --> 00:00:56,280
it can be blinded,

14
00:00:56,330 --> 00:00:57,820
tyrannical and dead.

15
00:00:58,570 --> 00:00:59,380
And so it's,

16
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:04,380
it's the mixture of the right amount of
chaos that turns that order into wisdom

17
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:07,870
and then that wisdom is often
personified as feminine.

18
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:11,950
Now that doesn't exactly answer your
question because it doesn't make the right

19
00:01:11,951 --> 00:01:12,430
balance.

20
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:14,620
You still don't have tyranny order,

21
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:17,810
you still don't have order,

22
00:01:17,811 --> 00:01:18,644
tyranny,

23
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:20,433
chaos.

24
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:22,870
You're still missing
the proper word there.

25
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:24,293
Um,

26
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:25,293
I don't,

27
00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:25,911
it's,

28
00:01:25,911 --> 00:01:26,890
it's a good question.

29
00:01:26,891 --> 00:01:27,130
And,

30
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:30,490
and the wisdom ideas the best
I can make of it for now.

31
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:35,680
Is it better to marry someone with
your temperament or a contrasting

32
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:37,390
complimentary temperament?

33
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:38,650
Well,

34
00:01:38,650 --> 00:01:43,030
there is evidence on this and basically
you don't want to marry someone with

35
00:01:43,031 --> 00:01:44,380
whom you're two mismatched.

36
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:48,310
Now the only possible exception
to that is neuroticism.

37
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:49,933
You know,

38
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:54,010
neuroticism is a good predictor of marital
trouble and it's a good predictor of

39
00:01:54,011 --> 00:01:56,680
trouble period or perhaps
sensitivity to trouble,

40
00:01:56,681 --> 00:01:58,900
which is in some sense the same thing.

41
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:00,580
It's very,

42
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:05,050
and I don't know of any research
specifically pertaining to this.

43
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:06,340
Um,

44
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:09,850
now I know that people who are high in
neuroticism are more likely to miss work

45
00:02:09,851 --> 00:02:12,460
and to visit the doctor and to,

46
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:13,660
um,

47
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:13,930
and,

48
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:16,240
and to be unhappy in their
marriages and so forth.

49
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:21,540
And that may also account for why 75%
of divorces are initiated by women.

50
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:22,750
Um,

51
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:25,300
and I think women are more
sensitive to negative emotion,

52
00:02:25,301 --> 00:02:28,450
partly because they have to take care
of infants and need to be more sensitive

53
00:02:28,451 --> 00:02:28,871
to threat.

54
00:02:28,871 --> 00:02:33,871
And perhaps because sexuality is more
dangerous to women and perhaps because

55
00:02:34,811 --> 00:02:36,280
women are physically smaller.

56
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:39,790
And all of this seems to
kick in at puberty anyways.

57
00:02:39,791 --> 00:02:43,810
It isn't obvious to me that you want
to match someone with regards to

58
00:02:43,811 --> 00:02:44,501
neuroticism.

59
00:02:44,501 --> 00:02:46,000
If you're high in neuroticism,

60
00:02:46,001 --> 00:02:47,530
I think if you're high in neuroticism,

61
00:02:47,531 --> 00:02:49,840
you need to find someone
who is low in neuroticism,

62
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:50,920
um,

63
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:53,560
because then you have someone
around to calm you down.

64
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:55,450
Now apart from that,

65
00:02:56,290 --> 00:03:00,850
the research literature does indicate
that match is better and you can see why

66
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:05,140
it's hard for extroverts and
introverts to get along if they're,

67
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:08,260
especially if they're extreme extroverts
and extreme introverts because an

68
00:03:08,261 --> 00:03:13,210
extreme extrovert always wants to be
with other people and in groups and an

69
00:03:13,211 --> 00:03:16,030
extreme introvert hardly ever wants that.

70
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:16,960
And that's a very,

71
00:03:16,961 --> 00:03:18,790
very difficult thing to negotiate.

72
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:21,430
And then with conscientiousness,

73
00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:22,211
same thing.

74
00:03:22,211 --> 00:03:23,680
If you're really high in orderliness,

75
00:03:23,681 --> 00:03:26,570
it's very hard to be married to
someone who is very low and ordered.

76
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:28,600
You're going to end up
doing all the cleaning,

77
00:03:28,601 --> 00:03:29,141
for example,

78
00:03:29,141 --> 00:03:30,220
that will drive you crazy.

79
00:03:30,221 --> 00:03:31,600
And if you're high and industriousness,

80
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:32,583
same thing,

81
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:33,570
healthy,

82
00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:36,370
are super high and
industriousness and orderliness,

83
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:40,630
you might want someone who's
maybe moderate in both to
kind of temper you a bit

84
00:03:40,631 --> 00:03:43,900
because one of the problems with being
too high in conscientiousness is that you

85
00:03:43,901 --> 00:03:47,710
can't stop working and you should
probably stop working from time to time.

86
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:49,120
Agreeableness,

87
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:50,110
same thing.

88
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:52,930
Hard for an agreeable and
disagreeable person to get along.

89
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:53,621
You know,

90
00:03:53,621 --> 00:03:55,330
the agreeable person will always be

91
00:03:57,970 --> 00:03:59,410
the disagreeable person.

92
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:00,760
Yeah.

93
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:04,990
Who won't shy away from conflict is
likely to dominate the agreeable person

94
00:04:04,991 --> 00:04:05,824
quite badly.

95
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:08,970
So that's a tough bridge to two.

96
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:11,380
That's a tough chasm to bridge as well.

97
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:15,130
So you look for temperamental similarity.

98
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:19,870
I'm at now it's complicated
because like if you're really,

99
00:04:19,871 --> 00:04:22,870
really low and industriousness and you
marry someone else who's really low and

100
00:04:22,871 --> 00:04:23,621
industriousness,

101
00:04:23,621 --> 00:04:26,620
well that's going to be trouble for both
of you because there isn't going to be

102
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:28,510
anyone around who's going to do the work.

103
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:29,733
So,

104
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:30,490
um,

105
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:32,050
you might understand each other better,

106
00:04:32,051 --> 00:04:34,810
but as a long term strategy
it's not a very good one.

107
00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:36,003
So

108
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:40,600
it seems like your message is
primarily positive masculine,

109
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:45,970
whereas the positive feminine is not
elaborated with near the same resolution.

110
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:47,200
What do you think?

111
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:48,483
Um,

112
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:50,560
I don't really think that's true.

113
00:04:50,561 --> 00:04:50,980
I,

114
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:53,920
I think that might be somewhat
true of 12 rules for life,

115
00:04:53,921 --> 00:04:55,260
although I'm not convinced of that.

116
00:04:55,261 --> 00:04:59,500
That message and 12 rules for life is to
find a balance between order and chaos.

117
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:05,100
And there's plenty of discussion in there
about the danger of an excess of both.

118
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:07,480
Certainly maps of meaning is,

119
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:08,763
um,

120
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:13,670
elaborated out more with regards
to the positive masculine.

121
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:14,270
Alright.

122
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:19,270
With regards to maps of
meaning is elaborated out
more completely than 12 rules

123
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:24,140
with regards to the positive role
of the masculine and the feminine.

124
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:25,413
Um,

125
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:31,510
I think it's complicated in part because
the feminine classically speaking is

126
00:05:32,301 --> 00:05:35,570
associated with smaller scale,

127
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,720
intimate familial groupings.

128
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:40,093
And so

129
00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:51,290
in a world that's obsessed with
adaptation to large scale social systems,

130
00:05:52,130 --> 00:05:55,970
it's harder to make a case
for the role of the feminine.

131
00:05:55,971 --> 00:05:59,060
We don't really understand role of
the feminine in large scale social

132
00:05:59,061 --> 00:05:59,894
structures.

133
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,273
So,

134
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:01,851
and you know,

135
00:06:01,851 --> 00:06:06,740
we don't have a cultural myth
apart from beauty and the beast.

136
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:11,741
Let's say the describes the role of
an independent female operating in the

137
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:16,700
fundamentally masculine social world.

138
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:20,330
And we don't even know what
something like that would look like.

139
00:06:20,331 --> 00:06:25,331
And there aren't guiding stories to some
degree because women haven't been able

140
00:06:26,301 --> 00:06:29,420
to do that except in
the last hundred years.

141
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:31,670
So I don't know what,

142
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:36,950
what the positive feminine on
a large scale would look like.

143
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:40,130
And we don't have
guiding stories for that.

144
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:45,340
This is partly to underlined
the absolutely radical
nature of the birth control

145
00:06:47,361 --> 00:06:47,830
pill.

146
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:48,030
And,

147
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:48,831
and not only that,

148
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:50,480
but the provision of,

149
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:51,463
of,

150
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:56,470
of technological devices that aid women
in dealing practically with their weekly

151
00:06:58,730 --> 00:07:00,170
or their monthly menstrual cycle,

152
00:07:00,171 --> 00:07:05,171
which was also a huge impediment to
women in terms of interacting in the,

153
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:06,231
let's say,

154
00:07:06,231 --> 00:07:07,430
the patriarchal world.

155
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:11,990
So now women can take their place in
the broader cultural world and we don't

156
00:07:11,991 --> 00:07:13,580
know what the model for that is.

157
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:15,110
So,

158
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:15,471
you know,

159
00:07:15,471 --> 00:07:16,041
you might say,

160
00:07:16,041 --> 00:07:16,251
well,

161
00:07:16,251 --> 00:07:19,820
they should adopt the heroin
masculine perspective.

162
00:07:19,821 --> 00:07:21,410
And certainly to some degree that's true,

163
00:07:21,411 --> 00:07:26,411
but that's not a particularly fruitful
archetype when it comes to having a

164
00:07:30,621 --> 00:07:34,610
family and having a family is
actually extraordinarily important.

165
00:07:34,611 --> 00:07:38,660
And it's certainly the thing that
dominates the thoughts of the majority of

166
00:07:38,661 --> 00:07:43,640
women as they approached their thirties
all cultural noise to the contrary.

167
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:46,850
So it's something we're
still puzzling out.

168
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:48,950
And I suppose I'm still
puzzling it out too.

169
00:07:48,951 --> 00:07:49,550
I mean,

170
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:50,450
with my daughter,

171
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:56,110
I tried to encourage her to be as sharp
and is intelligent and critically minded

172
00:07:57,381 --> 00:07:59,390
and ambitious as she could be,

173
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:03,370
but also let her to let
her know that if she,

174
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:04,100
and she,

175
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:04,550
she,

176
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:06,710
she was always interested in having kids.

177
00:08:07,210 --> 00:08:07,700
Um,

178
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:11,120
but to also let her know that having
a family who is an extremely important

179
00:08:11,121 --> 00:08:11,954
thing,

180
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:13,003
um,

181
00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:14,150
how to balance that.

182
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:16,010
Well that is the modern
conundrum isn't it?

183
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:21,280
We want to figure out how to maximize
our access to the talents of women,

184
00:08:21,890 --> 00:08:26,890
but also to set up a situation where it's
possible for talented women and women

185
00:08:27,411 --> 00:08:28,340
of all talents,

186
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:29,330
let's say as well,

187
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:33,830
but talented women who have options in
the workplace to also have a family.

188
00:08:33,831 --> 00:08:38,000
And this is a tremendously complex problem
and it isn't clear how it's going to

189
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:39,913
be solved.

190
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:40,791
You know,

191
00:08:40,791 --> 00:08:41,990
there is data showing,

192
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:42,231
you know,

193
00:08:42,231 --> 00:08:42,501
you say,

194
00:08:42,501 --> 00:08:42,651
well,

195
00:08:42,651 --> 00:08:44,720
men should pick up more
of the feminine role.

196
00:08:44,721 --> 00:08:46,580
And I suppose that's possible.

197
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:48,650
But there is good data showing,

198
00:08:48,651 --> 00:08:49,281
for example,

199
00:08:49,281 --> 00:08:54,281
that if he show women pictures of
men engaged in classically masculine

200
00:08:54,441 --> 00:08:55,080
endeavors,

201
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:55,351
you know,

202
00:08:55,351 --> 00:08:57,840
fixing a roof or fixing
the plumbing or so forth,

203
00:08:58,220 --> 00:08:59,040
um,

204
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,650
or in feminine endeavors
doing the dishes and,

205
00:09:01,651 --> 00:09:01,951
and,

206
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:02,401
and,

207
00:09:02,401 --> 00:09:06,740
and vacuuming that the women rate the man
who are doing the female tasks as well

208
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,430
as less sexually attractive.

209
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:13,940
And so it's not all on the
men with regards to the
utility of them picking up a

210
00:09:14,071 --> 00:09:15,210
more feminine role,

211
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:15,991
you know,

212
00:09:15,991 --> 00:09:20,991
and it isn't necessarily the case
that women will find men who are more

213
00:09:21,721 --> 00:09:22,590
domestic,

214
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:24,930
also maximally sexually attractive.

215
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,760
Those things don't
necessarily go together.

216
00:09:26,761 --> 00:09:27,541
So this is very,

217
00:09:27,541 --> 00:09:28,590
very complicated.
