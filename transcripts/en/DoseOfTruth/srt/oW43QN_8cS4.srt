1
00:00:07,430 --> 00:00:07,630
Yeah.

2
00:00:07,630 --> 00:00:09,790
Books we read to our young children.

3
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:10,751
Well,

4
00:00:10,751 --> 00:00:11,830
it depends on how young,

5
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:13,451
really young.

6
00:00:13,451 --> 00:00:16,780
There's this book called how to teach
your child to read in a hundred easy

7
00:00:16,781 --> 00:00:17,231
lessons,

8
00:00:17,231 --> 00:00:18,100
all type that.

9
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:19,913
Um,

10
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:25,753
yeah,

11
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:27,121
no,

12
00:00:27,121 --> 00:00:28,530
I've done something technical.

13
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:40,770
It's called how to teach.

14
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:41,101
I mean,

15
00:00:41,101 --> 00:00:46,101
something technically poor your
child to read in 100 easy lessons.

16
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:53,560
That is an excellent book because you can
actually teach your child to read in a

17
00:00:53,561 --> 00:00:54,391
hundred easy lessons.

18
00:00:54,391 --> 00:00:55,171
Very smart,

19
00:00:55,171 --> 00:00:55,560
very,

20
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:56,341
very smart book.

21
00:00:56,341 --> 00:00:59,190
Very well developed
psychologically older kids.

22
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:00,810
I really liked the Harry Potter books.

23
00:01:00,811 --> 00:01:04,200
I think that rolling nailed
the mythological structure.

24
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:05,423
Um,

25
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:06,600
what else?

26
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:06,960
I mean,

27
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,090
I'm in collaboration with my daughter.

28
00:01:09,091 --> 00:01:11,880
I'm putting together a reading
list for young people for,

29
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:13,170
for kids and young adults.

30
00:01:13,171 --> 00:01:15,600
So I guess I'll have
to answer it that way.

31
00:01:15,790 --> 00:01:16,623
MMM.

32
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:23,980
I can't bring it to mind and
I can't bring it to mind.
