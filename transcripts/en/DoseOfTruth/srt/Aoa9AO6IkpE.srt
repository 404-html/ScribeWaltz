1
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:07,380
Okay.

2
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:08,140
I said No.

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:09,040
Richard also asked,

4
00:00:09,041 --> 00:00:12,940
how can I talk about the resentments of
my childhood in a way that benefits them

5
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:14,590
instead of giving them guilt?

6
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:19,570
I don't know if I can
answer that question,

7
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:20,410
Richard,

8
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:22,670
because it's,

9
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:25,720
it's not a question that's,

10
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:30,610
see what I would ask if you came to
talk to me and you have that question.

11
00:00:30,611 --> 00:00:31,870
I would say first of all,

12
00:00:31,871 --> 00:00:32,704
well

13
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:35,210
what resentments?

14
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:36,651
List them out,

15
00:00:36,651 --> 00:00:37,484
man.

16
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:38,383
Write him down.

17
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:39,793
Okay,

18
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:40,311
so the,

19
00:00:40,311 --> 00:00:41,660
you know what they are.

20
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:42,523
Because all of those,

21
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:46,160
each of those resentments is going to
be a different thing and the strategy

22
00:00:46,161 --> 00:00:51,080
that's associated with each might vary
as a consequence of the particularity of

23
00:00:51,081 --> 00:00:51,914
the resentment.

24
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:55,550
So I would say you should start by
writing them down like what's your problem

25
00:00:55,551 --> 00:00:56,720
exactly here.

26
00:00:56,721 --> 00:01:00,410
Here's all the things that I can think
of that I'm angry about with regard to my

27
00:01:00,411 --> 00:01:01,190
childhood.

28
00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:06,190
Write that down and then see
which ones are are still living.

29
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:09,590
And then you have to figure out,

30
00:01:09,591 --> 00:01:09,891
well,

31
00:01:09,891 --> 00:01:11,600
what do you want from your parents?

32
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:12,261
Exactly.

33
00:01:12,261 --> 00:01:13,040
Do you,

34
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,780
do you want them to apologize?

35
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:17,450
Do you want them to understand
what they did wrong?

36
00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:18,860
Do you want to punish them?

37
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:20,870
Do you want to get,

38
00:01:20,871 --> 00:01:21,890
let them get you,

39
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:25,190
let them learn to know you better?

40
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:30,170
Do you want to change the way
they're interacting with you now?

41
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:34,610
Do you want to learn your own lessons
from your bad experience so that when

42
00:01:34,611 --> 00:01:35,241
you're a parent,

43
00:01:35,241 --> 00:01:36,800
you don't make the same mistake?

44
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:41,480
You merely want to have a chance to
express yourself like it's very difficult

45
00:01:41,481 --> 00:01:42,110
to,

46
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:45,110
to answer your question because
I don't know what your goal is,

47
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:45,861
right?

48
00:01:45,861 --> 00:01:46,680
So we bet and,

49
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:47,780
and I don't need to know.

50
00:01:47,781 --> 00:01:52,010
You need to know what are the resentments
so we can walk through the process we

51
00:01:52,011 --> 00:01:52,790
already described.

52
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:57,790
Lay them out and comprehensively you
might want to make a list of everything

53
00:01:57,981 --> 00:02:01,730
that you think you might conceivably
be annoyed about with regards to your

54
00:02:01,731 --> 00:02:03,380
parents no matter how trivial,

55
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:04,211
right?

56
00:02:04,211 --> 00:02:05,300
Cause then that way you,

57
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:09,020
you scour your memory for four,

58
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:09,883
four,

59
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:11,060
four,

60
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:15,080
four things that you're
holding onto in a bitter way.

61
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:17,030
And maybe you have your justification.

62
00:02:17,031 --> 00:02:18,530
I'm not suggesting that you don't,

63
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:21,710
but you need to discover
what baggage you're carrying.

64
00:02:21,711 --> 00:02:22,491
Then you have to figure out,

65
00:02:22,491 --> 00:02:24,830
well what can I let go of and what's core?

66
00:02:24,831 --> 00:02:26,720
And I would say what's really core is

67
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:33,200
if there are ways that your
parents treated you that
are still affecting you or

68
00:02:33,201 --> 00:02:37,460
that are affecting your relationships
with them now those really need to be

69
00:02:37,461 --> 00:02:39,200
dealt with because they're not done.

70
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:40,580
They're not in the past,

71
00:02:40,581 --> 00:02:40,940
right?

72
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:42,630
They're not even resentments of your job,

73
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:44,630
but they're still part
of your ongoing life.

74
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:46,123
And so,

75
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:48,471
okay,

76
00:02:48,471 --> 00:02:50,570
so now you have all your
resentments laid out.

77
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:51,890
I guess I would say,

78
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:52,611
you know,

79
00:02:52,611 --> 00:02:53,444
something like,

80
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,350
look mom and dad,

81
00:02:54,351 --> 00:02:57,440
there's something I need to talk to you
about that's been bothering me for a

82
00:02:57,441 --> 00:03:00,670
long time and I pick one of the
trivial things to begin with.

83
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:01,210
It's like,

84
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:05,350
here's a memory I have and don't get
all high and mighty about it because you

85
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:05,501
know,

86
00:03:05,501 --> 00:03:08,110
you might have misconstrued
the situation as a child,

87
00:03:08,111 --> 00:03:09,190
it's highly probable.

88
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:13,210
And they may have had their reasons and
you may not even remember the situation,

89
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:15,680
let's say correctly or the
way they remembered to say,

90
00:03:15,681 --> 00:03:16,240
well,

91
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:16,960
here's,

92
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,970
here's something that happened
when I was a kid in it.

93
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:20,470
It still bothers me in,

94
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:21,940
do you remember what happened?

95
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:23,410
That's an open ended question.

96
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:24,580
Do you remember what happened?

97
00:03:24,581 --> 00:03:25,480
Why did this,

98
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:26,920
why did this go this way?

99
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:29,200
And then I would do an
awful lot of listening,

100
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:29,771
you know,

101
00:03:29,771 --> 00:03:34,120
because you are trying to
gather information and the
more your parents can tell

102
00:03:34,121 --> 00:03:36,340
you about what happened
in those situations,

103
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:38,980
I would say the better
off you're likely to be.

104
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:43,210
So that's about all I can say about that.

105
00:03:43,211 --> 00:03:47,950
That's fairly delineated
approach to general discussions
about difficult things.

106
00:03:47,951 --> 00:03:48,191
Right?

107
00:03:48,191 --> 00:03:50,080
But I would say don't be afraid of,

108
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:56,100
don't be more afraid of engaging in
this process then you are afraid of not

109
00:03:56,231 --> 00:03:57,160
engaging in it.

110
00:03:57,730 --> 00:04:00,520
Like every relationship you have
is going to have problems in it.

111
00:04:00,521 --> 00:04:01,660
And you know,

112
00:04:01,661 --> 00:04:06,661
you don't want to jump to a intense
psychological discussion with every little

113
00:04:07,031 --> 00:04:07,864
bump.

114
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:10,660
But if there's something,

115
00:04:10,661 --> 00:04:11,290
um,

116
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:14,410
medium to longterm permanence
that's disturbing you,

117
00:04:14,411 --> 00:04:18,370
or a pattern that repeats
itself at least three times,

118
00:04:18,610 --> 00:04:19,091
let's say,

119
00:04:19,091 --> 00:04:22,990
well then that might be something that's
worthy of discussion or your discovery

120
00:04:22,991 --> 00:04:26,470
that you're very dissatisfied with
the way the relationship is going,

121
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:30,670
and you have to have the conflict
necessary to sort that out.

122
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:34,150
And it's going to be conflict with you
and the Co and the person that you're

123
00:04:34,151 --> 00:04:34,661
talking to.

124
00:04:34,661 --> 00:04:39,661
But the aim should be the establishment
of something like fully informed,

125
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:44,590
fully negotiated medium to longterm piece.

126
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:45,730
That's what you're aiming at.

127
00:04:45,731 --> 00:04:46,930
If you have any sense.
