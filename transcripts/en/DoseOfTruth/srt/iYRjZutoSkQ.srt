1
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:09,740
So there's no easy way out.

2
00:00:09,741 --> 00:00:10,880
It's not an easy out,

3
00:00:10,881 --> 00:00:14,260
it's just pure cynicism to
associate that idea with,

4
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:15,020
with an easy out,

5
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:15,853
it's not.

6
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:21,040
But there is that positive idea that
it's continually represented is that the

7
00:00:21,351 --> 00:00:22,011
individuals,

8
00:00:22,011 --> 00:00:27,011
the source of moral choice and the
individual is prone to genuine error and

9
00:00:30,411 --> 00:00:33,200
temptation in a believable
and realistic way.

10
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:37,880
But that that doesn't sever
the relationship between
the individual and the

11
00:00:37,881 --> 00:00:40,370
divine and the possibility
of further growth.

12
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:41,421
And then I would say,

13
00:00:41,421 --> 00:00:43,460
well thank God for that
because without that,

14
00:00:43,461 --> 00:00:44,900
like who would have a chance?

15
00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:45,231
Right?

16
00:00:45,231 --> 00:00:46,190
Who would have a chance.

17
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:51,730
And so the idea that the day that
he has presented the infinite,

18
00:00:52,311 --> 00:00:55,910
let's say as presented in
the Old Testament is merely
judgmental is definitely

19
00:00:55,911 --> 00:01:00,830
wrong and is in fact something that
you can contend with and Argen with.

20
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:01,191
Oh,

21
00:01:01,191 --> 00:01:02,390
I'll close with one thing.

22
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:06,860
One of the things that I learned while
I was going through this was the meaning

23
00:01:06,861 --> 00:01:07,760
of the name Israel.

24
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:10,130
Cause Jacob eventually gets named Israel.

25
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:11,130
And,

26
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:13,130
and I'm jumping ahead a little bit to the,

27
00:01:13,131 --> 00:01:13,970
to the next lecture,

28
00:01:13,971 --> 00:01:18,971
but Israel and so he's also the father
of Israel and the father of the 12 sons

29
00:01:19,461 --> 00:01:21,140
who make up the 12 tribes of Israel.

30
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:24,290
But what Israel means is
he who struggles with God.

31
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:28,010
And that's such an interesting
idea because it's again,

32
00:01:28,011 --> 00:01:29,150
a psychological idea.

33
00:01:29,151 --> 00:01:33,350
And that's why I said earlier that it
isn't obvious in the old testament what it

34
00:01:33,351 --> 00:01:35,590
means to believe in God
because what Jacob does,

35
00:01:35,591 --> 00:01:36,920
his struggle with God.

36
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:41,870
And I think that that's a really good
characterization of an ethical life

37
00:01:41,871 --> 00:01:44,090
because if you're trying
to lead an ethical life,

38
00:01:44,091 --> 00:01:45,350
that's what you're doing is you're,

39
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:46,610
you're struggling.

40
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:50,630
Like blind belief isn't helpful because
you don't know what you're believing in.

41
00:01:50,631 --> 00:01:52,310
Like it's just not that helpful.

42
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:54,380
But if you're possessed by,

43
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:57,440
by the desire to orient yourself properly,

44
00:01:57,441 --> 00:01:59,150
but also confused by the,

45
00:01:59,210 --> 00:02:01,280
by the existential structure of the world,

46
00:02:01,281 --> 00:02:02,360
which we all are then,

47
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:06,140
then what you're doing when you're trying
to orient yourself properly in life is

48
00:02:06,141 --> 00:02:07,730
struggling ethically.

49
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:10,400
And Jacob actually gets quite hurt.

50
00:02:10,401 --> 00:02:11,950
He wrestles with God literally,

51
00:02:11,951 --> 00:02:14,000
and God dislocates his,

52
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:14,690
his,

53
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:15,441
his thigh.

54
00:02:15,441 --> 00:02:15,861
And so,

55
00:02:15,861 --> 00:02:16,101
you know,

56
00:02:16,101 --> 00:02:18,650
the idea there is watch the hell out,

57
00:02:18,651 --> 00:02:18,921
right?

58
00:02:18,921 --> 00:02:22,160
The thing that you're
contending with is powerful,

59
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:23,840
although you can contend with it.

60
00:02:23,841 --> 00:02:25,220
That's the thing that's so interesting,

61
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:25,851
but you know,

62
00:02:25,851 --> 00:02:27,710
you do it at some genuine peril,

63
00:02:27,711 --> 00:02:29,540
which I think is exactly right.

64
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:31,040
But the idea that Israel,

65
00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:32,660
so there's Israel,

66
00:02:32,661 --> 00:02:33,201
the state,

67
00:02:33,201 --> 00:02:34,034
let's say in Israel,

68
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,270
the promised land and all of that.

69
00:02:35,271 --> 00:02:36,800
But there's this more important idea,

70
00:02:36,801 --> 00:02:37,634
which is again,

71
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:38,780
a psychological idea,

72
00:02:38,781 --> 00:02:40,490
which is the state of Israel,

73
00:02:40,491 --> 00:02:45,230
which is the promised land is the state
that everyone who wrestles with God

74
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:46,380
exists in.

75
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,880
And that's not happy,

76
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:52,640
naive belief in,

77
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:53,361
you know,

78
00:02:53,361 --> 00:02:53,900
uh,

79
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:55,880
an eternally blessed afterlife.

80
00:02:55,881 --> 00:02:58,100
It's not that it's not a wish fulfillment,

81
00:02:58,101 --> 00:02:58,810
it's,

82
00:02:58,810 --> 00:02:59,230
it's,

83
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:03,850
it's to be actively engaged in
life and the difficulties of life,

84
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:04,390
right?

85
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:08,620
And trying to find the path because
that's what wrestling with God is,

86
00:03:08,621 --> 00:03:10,450
is trying to find the path.

87
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:15,310
And that seems to me what belief means
fundamentally in the Old Testament,

88
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:16,810
perhaps in the new testament as well,

89
00:03:16,811 --> 00:03:21,430
is that belief is expressed
in trying to find the path.

90
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:23,290
And that's an ethical struggle.

91
00:03:23,291 --> 00:03:24,310
And it's a real struggle.

92
00:03:24,311 --> 00:03:25,450
It's the struggle of life.

93
00:03:25,451 --> 00:03:28,270
So as long as you're willing
to engage in that struggle,

94
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:32,170
then hypothetically you
have the divine behind you.

95
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:33,903
And so

96
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:36,483
I believe that.

97
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:41,910
I think that's true because the other
thing I see is that the people who set

98
00:03:42,281 --> 00:03:45,000
things right so that the,

99
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:46,203
the,

100
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:51,370
the horrible forces of cosmic destruction
don't do us in the people who are

101
00:03:51,371 --> 00:03:55,780
trying to set things right are the ones
that are struggling ethically and so,

102
00:03:55,781 --> 00:03:58,090
and that there is a
redemptive element to that.

103
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:01,240
And I don't think there's any
way of being cynical about that.

104
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:03,003
So.

105
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:04,811
Well,

106
00:04:04,811 --> 00:04:05,380
so thank you.
