1
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:06,180
You're trying to do well in a class and
you get a bad grade.

2
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:09,270
Okay,
so you're in this little frame.

3
00:00:09,271 --> 00:00:11,010
You want to get a good grade that isn't
happening.

4
00:00:11,011 --> 00:00:12,720
He got a bad grade.
Okay,

5
00:00:12,721 --> 00:00:16,500
what is it that's manifesting itself as
the bad grade?

6
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:17,700
While you could say,
well,

7
00:00:17,701 --> 00:00:19,980
it's a c minus on a piece of paper.
It's like,

8
00:00:19,981 --> 00:00:20,600
well,
that's,

9
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:23,880
you know,
really know that that's the objective

10
00:00:23,881 --> 00:00:26,400
manifestation.
You've got a piece of paper with a c

11
00:00:26,401 --> 00:00:30,690
minus the value free proposition is that
you've been delivered a piece of paper

12
00:00:30,691 --> 00:00:32,370
with a curve on it and a little,
you know,

13
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:34,290
negative side.
Well,

14
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:36,300
you think,
well that's what that is.

15
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:37,610
Well,
you know it's,

16
00:00:37,611 --> 00:00:40,440
it's as dopey is thinking,
well here you got your failing grade.

17
00:00:40,441 --> 00:00:43,080
You go into the lab and you like weigh
it on a scale.

18
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:45,300
Then you burn it and see what it was
made of.

19
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:45,871
It's like,
well,

20
00:00:45,871 --> 00:00:48,240
why did I get so upset about that?
It's just paper.

21
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:50,280
It's like,
no,

22
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:54,510
that's not just paper.
It's an entity that exists in a web of

23
00:00:54,511 --> 00:00:57,480
connections.
The fact that it signified by paper is

24
00:00:57,481 --> 00:00:59,340
almost completely irrelevant.
What is it?

25
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:03,600
The answer is you don't know.
And that's why when you pick it up,

26
00:01:03,601 --> 00:01:07,530
you get this paralyzed,
sinking feeling because your limbic

27
00:01:07,531 --> 00:01:10,500
system is a lot smarter than your
perceptual systems.

28
00:01:10,501 --> 00:01:12,600
And your perceptual systems say,
well,

29
00:01:12,601 --> 00:01:14,580
that's a piece of paper,
and your limbic system says,

30
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:17,280
Nah,
for sure dragon.

31
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:19,440
Right?
Right.

32
00:01:19,441 --> 00:01:23,010
And so then you're sweating and then
maybe you put it away and you go play

33
00:01:23,011 --> 00:01:27,090
video games because you know better the
hypothetical dragon,

34
00:01:27,091 --> 00:01:30,720
then the real dragon.
And so instead you pull out the piece of

35
00:01:30,721 --> 00:01:32,190
paper maybe and you think,
okay,

36
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:35,220
why did I get this c minus?

37
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:37,530
Well,
that's a hell of a question,

38
00:01:37,531 --> 00:01:38,610
isn't it?
It's like,

39
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:41,370
maybe you're stupid.
Well,

40
00:01:41,371 --> 00:01:43,500
that could be,
or at least stupid compared to who you

41
00:01:43,501 --> 00:01:44,610
think you are.
Like that's,

42
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,470
that's the real horror that's lurking
there,

43
00:01:46,471 --> 00:01:46,851
right?
It's like,

44
00:01:46,851 --> 00:01:48,090
oh,
I thought it was kind of smart.

45
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:51,180
That's a,
that's a proposition of the highest

46
00:01:51,181 --> 00:01:53,310
order.
I thought I was kind of smart.

47
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:53,971
It's like,
yeah,

48
00:01:53,971 --> 00:01:55,890
well what about this c minus?
It's like,

49
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,500
well,
that God damn professor,

50
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:00,030
right?
That's the first thing.

51
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:03,030
It's,
it's I've been attacked by a predator.

52
00:02:03,031 --> 00:02:04,680
That's the first response.
Right.

53
00:02:04,681 --> 00:02:06,390
So it's,
it's a nonsensical message.

54
00:02:06,391 --> 00:02:08,610
It's just delivered by someone evil and
predatory.

55
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,890
Well that's,
you know,

56
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:13,380
possible.
But I wouldn't go there.

57
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:16,590
I wouldn't go there first necessarily.
So,

58
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:18,810
but then,
well then say you don't go there.

59
00:02:18,811 --> 00:02:19,321
Okay,
well,

60
00:02:19,321 --> 00:02:23,310
so what is this exactly?
Do you not know what you thought you

61
00:02:23,311 --> 00:02:24,144
knew?

62
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:27,390
Are you not who you think you are?
Do you don't work hard enough?

63
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:31,290
Are Your values not organized properly?
Do you misuse your time?

64
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:35,310
Are you in the wrong field?
Have is the way you're construing Your

65
00:02:35,311 --> 00:02:38,310
Life Completely Inappropriate?
Are you acting out what your parents

66
00:02:38,311 --> 00:02:40,350
wanted you to do it and you're pissed
off about it.

67
00:02:40,351 --> 00:02:43,770
So you're only running at 40% to spite
them despite the fact that they're

68
00:02:43,771 --> 00:02:46,530
paying $25,000 a year for your
education.

69
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:48,630
Cause that's a fun game.
Yeah,

70
00:02:48,631 --> 00:02:52,080
I'll go do what you want me to do,
but I'll fail at.

71
00:02:52,081 --> 00:02:55,410
But not completely because then that
would wouldn't cost you very much.

72
00:02:55,411 --> 00:02:59,980
I'll just fail a little bit so that you
have to spend all that money forcing me

73
00:02:59,981 --> 00:03:03,070
to do what I don't want to do,
but you'll never get to escape from it.

74
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:06,430
And then every time we interact,
I'll stab you in various ways that you

75
00:03:06,431 --> 00:03:07,510
don't quite understand.

76
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:11,740
Just to show you how irritated I am that
I happened to be acting out the destiny

77
00:03:11,741 --> 00:03:15,130
that you've put forward for me.
So maybe that's part of the Dragon,

78
00:03:15,131 --> 00:03:17,470
right?
And then that pulls in the whole parent

79
00:03:17,471 --> 00:03:19,410
thing and you know it's,
it's,

80
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:22,090
these are bottomless pits.
Often when you,

81
00:03:22,091 --> 00:03:25,090
when you're in the world and it's
something objects to you,

82
00:03:25,091 --> 00:03:28,090
something that matters,
objects to you,

83
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:32,080
then the in the entire unrealized world
is in that thing that objects,

84
00:03:32,081 --> 00:03:35,110
it's all tangled up inside it.
That's why it's the great dragon of

85
00:03:35,111 --> 00:03:37,630
chaos.
It's everything that's outside of your

86
00:03:37,631 --> 00:03:41,860
conceptual structure and what is that?
It's everything that lurks outside of

87
00:03:41,861 --> 00:03:43,720
your,
of your walled city.

88
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:47,020
And it's manifested itself like the
snake in the garden.

89
00:03:47,021 --> 00:03:50,470
And the easiest thing to do is say,
I'm not having anything to do with that.

90
00:03:50,471 --> 00:03:53,500
But the problem with that is,
well,

91
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:55,900
you get your c minus and you don't do
anything about it.

92
00:03:55,930 --> 00:03:58,870
Maybe you're a little bitter and more
resentful and your study habits get a

93
00:03:58,871 --> 00:04:01,570
little worse.
So the next time you get like a d plus

94
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:04,930
and then you collect a bunch of F's and
then you stopped going to school,

95
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:07,390
then he stopped showering,
right?

96
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:10,140
Then you end up jumping off the bridge.
And so that's uh,

97
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,460
that's,
that's how the dragon eats you when you

98
00:04:12,461 --> 00:04:15,670
don't pay attention to it.
And so it's no bloody wonder that people

99
00:04:15,671 --> 00:04:16,750
avoid,
you know,

100
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:21,640
it's really no wonder that they avoid,
because error messages contain within

101
00:04:21,641 --> 00:04:26,641
them the implicit world.
Now the upside of that is while they

102
00:04:26,711 --> 00:04:30,550
contain within them the implicit world
and the world isn't all negative,

103
00:04:30,551 --> 00:04:33,970
and so maybe you get your c minus and
that's actually the best gift you ever

104
00:04:33,971 --> 00:04:37,360
got because somebody finally took you
and went whack,

105
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:39,130
you know,
clue in.

106
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:41,050
And so you take that apart and you
think,

107
00:04:41,051 --> 00:04:42,100
oh,
I don't know how to write.

108
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:45,370
I don't know how to think.
I've never read anything in my life.

109
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:47,440
My study habits are a Bismal,
you know,

110
00:04:47,441 --> 00:04:50,080
like maybe I'm working at 2% efficiency,
which,

111
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:51,880
which is probably,
I would suspect that,

112
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,860
you know,
some of you aren't doing that,

113
00:04:53,861 --> 00:04:58,780
but I bet you that I bet there's 30 30
to 50% of the people in the room are

114
00:04:58,781 --> 00:05:01,240
working at 2% efficiency.
It's like you got it.

115
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:02,140
That's,
so,

116
00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:04,330
to find that out is so optimistic.
I mean,

117
00:05:04,331 --> 00:05:08,140
if you're barely hanging in there,
but you're only working at 2% you might

118
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:10,390
imagine what you could have as a life if
you work at,

119
00:05:10,391 --> 00:05:13,690
at like 50% so,
so the,

120
00:05:13,691 --> 00:05:16,480
the c minus can be the best gift you
ever had.

121
00:05:16,481 --> 00:05:18,340
And that's the goal that the dragon
hordes,

122
00:05:18,341 --> 00:05:19,990
right?
That's exactly what that means.
