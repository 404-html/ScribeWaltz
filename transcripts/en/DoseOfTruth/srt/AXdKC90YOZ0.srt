1
00:00:03,910 --> 00:00:08,380
You just don't want someone
acting radically around
you like and you know that.

2
00:00:08,381 --> 00:00:09,670
So he walked down Bluer.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:11,510
Okay.

4
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:14,210
And there's people there that
should really be institutionalized,

5
00:00:14,211 --> 00:00:19,010
but we deinstitutionalized them all
so they could be free and free to be,

6
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:20,173
you know,

7
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:23,810
suffering and malfunctioning
out on the street.

8
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,370
That's what the freedom ended up being.

9
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:25,911
But you know,

10
00:00:25,911 --> 00:00:28,220
when you walk by someone like that who's

11
00:00:29,810 --> 00:00:32,960
moderating away to the voices
in his head and you know,

12
00:00:32,961 --> 00:00:33,794
maybe

13
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:40,600
striking out against whatever it is
that's plaguing him and you will make eye

14
00:00:40,851 --> 00:00:41,684
contact.

15
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:44,420
You might even go across the street,

16
00:00:44,421 --> 00:00:46,310
you're certainly going
to give him a wide berth.

17
00:00:46,311 --> 00:00:51,311
You're going to keep a distance between
him and you and you're going to hope

18
00:00:51,321 --> 00:00:56,180
that you don't attract his
attention because he's not
in the dominance hierarchy

19
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,640
and you don't know what
the hell he might do.

20
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:01,490
And that's unexplored territory too.

21
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:03,470
That's another way of thinking about it.

22
00:01:03,471 --> 00:01:04,304
Like

23
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:07,340
we inhabit time and space,

24
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:09,380
not just space and not just time.

25
00:01:09,381 --> 00:01:14,000
We didn't have it time and space and
our territory's our spacial temporal.

26
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:19,240
We're here now and this is safe now and
it's safe partly because of the physical

27
00:01:20,301 --> 00:01:21,590
structure and it's working,

28
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:26,420
but it's also safe because none of
you are manifesting peculiar behavior.

29
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:30,410
But if you started to
manifest peculiar behavior,

30
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:36,160
if you stood up and started muttering or
yelling or maybe attacking someone next

31
00:01:36,171 --> 00:01:37,004
to you,

32
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:41,270
all the rest of you would freeze first
because then all of a sudden this would

33
00:01:41,271 --> 00:01:42,650
be unexplored territory.

34
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,500
The match between what you want,

35
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:48,500
which is a peaceful lecture
that you hope has some content.

36
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:55,050
The match between what you want
and what's happening has vanished.

37
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:57,060
And so then you're not,

38
00:01:57,510 --> 00:01:58,470
you don't know where you are.

39
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:01,920
And so then what do you do when
you don't know where you are?

40
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:04,470
What do you do when you
don't know what to do?

41
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:05,491
Well,

42
00:02:05,491 --> 00:02:06,241
if your computer,

43
00:02:06,241 --> 00:02:07,200
you just crash,

44
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:11,370
but you know what good is that to you?

45
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,570
You're just going to die.

46
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:13,860
That isn't helpful.

47
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:15,850
Okay?

48
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:20,850
You freeze first and then maybe you
cautiously cautiously attend or maybe you

49
00:02:21,431 --> 00:02:21,700
don't.

50
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:24,940
Maybe you just keep your damn eyes averted
and you sit there and you hope that

51
00:02:24,941 --> 00:02:25,900
no one notices you.

52
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:27,093
That's a predator.

53
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:28,450
That's a prey response,

54
00:02:28,451 --> 00:02:28,661
right?

55
00:02:28,661 --> 00:02:31,810
That's like a rabbit frozen when it
thinks that Fox is looking at it.

56
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:33,910
And we were prey animals for a long time.

57
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:37,720
There was a cat that
they recently discovered,

58
00:02:37,721 --> 00:02:42,721
a prehistoric cap that had this bottom
single tooth and they found out that it a

59
00:02:43,391 --> 00:02:45,490
human skull fit right inside its mouth.

60
00:02:45,491 --> 00:02:49,210
And so it could grab you here and
Pierce the back of your skull with its,

61
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,400
with its single tooth.

62
00:02:51,401 --> 00:02:53,050
And that's what it was evolved for.

63
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:54,213
So,

64
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:55,083
you know,

65
00:02:56,890 --> 00:02:57,420
okay,

66
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:58,590
it's under such conditions.

67
00:02:58,591 --> 00:03:01,090
We evolved and we're predators obviously,

68
00:03:01,091 --> 00:03:02,680
but we're tasty predators.

69
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:05,680
And so other things were
perfectly happy to eat us.

70
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:08,783
Okay.

71
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,900
And so when you're aware
you don't know what to do,

72
00:03:10,901 --> 00:03:15,430
you act like a prey animal and that's
probably what you should do because maybe

73
00:03:15,431 --> 00:03:18,310
if you keep your head
down and shut the hell up,

74
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:21,290
there won't be any attention
to attracted to you.

75
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,240
And maybe you'll get through it.

76
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:24,493
You know,

77
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,850
you might decide,

78
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:31,010
unlikely to intervene
and take the guy down,

79
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:32,383
but,

80
00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:36,230
but you would be the exception
rather than the norm.

81
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:38,510
And it's unsurprising.

82
00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:39,640
Okay.
