1
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:08,960
Okay.
So the Pharaoh was pretty impressed by

2
00:00:08,961 --> 00:00:11,060
this dream interpretation and pretty
worried about it.

3
00:00:11,061 --> 00:00:14,150
And I guess he's a reasonable person
despite the fact that he put Joseph in

4
00:00:14,151 --> 00:00:15,300
jail.
Uh,

5
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:19,990
I guess he didn't have much choice.
Now therefore let Pharaoh look for a man

6
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:23,230
discreet and wise and set him over the
land of Egypt.

7
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:26,410
Let Pharaoh do this and let him appoint
officers over the loud.

8
00:00:26,411 --> 00:00:29,680
This is what Joseph is saying,
and take up the fifth part of the land

9
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:35,070
of Egypt in the seven plenteous years
and let them gather all the food of

10
00:00:36,731 --> 00:00:39,820
those good years that come and lay up
corn under the hand of Pharaoh and let

11
00:00:39,821 --> 00:00:44,821
them keep food in the cities
and just like that Joseph has restored

12
00:00:45,331 --> 00:00:49,990
to his position.
So Pharaoh said unto Joseph,

13
00:00:49,991 --> 00:00:53,830
I am Pharaoh and without these shall no
man lift up his hand or foot in all of

14
00:00:53,831 --> 00:00:54,580
the land of Egypt.

15
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:59,350
And so he comes out of the prison and he
really,

16
00:00:59,410 --> 00:01:01,240
in some sense,
as far as I'm concerned,

17
00:01:01,810 --> 00:01:05,080
he actually occupies a position that's
higher than the position of the Pharaoh.

18
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:07,960
It depends on how you look at it.
Because the Pharaoh is relegated himself

19
00:01:07,961 --> 00:01:10,150
to ceremonial status,
right?

20
00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:12,970
Joseph has all the responsibility,
makes all the decisions.

21
00:01:12,971 --> 00:01:17,971
So defacto he's the Pharaoh.
He doesn't get the glory precisely,

22
00:01:18,101 --> 00:01:19,840
although he's not doing too bad for
himself,

23
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,730
not,
there's a lesson in that too.

24
00:01:21,731 --> 00:01:25,540
Um,
I wrote these rules for Quora a long

25
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:28,240
time ago and one of them,
I have written them into this,

26
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:30,940
some of them into this book you guys go
to a pamphlet about today.

27
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:33,040
One of the rules that I didn't write
about was

28
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:37,980
note that responsive note,
that opportunity lurks where

29
00:01:37,981 --> 00:01:41,910
responsibility has been abdicated,
which is really interesting,

30
00:01:41,911 --> 00:01:43,020
I think.
I mean,

31
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,570
I've seen people in their jobs,
they say things like,

32
00:01:45,571 --> 00:01:46,370
well,
my,

33
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:48,240
the guy I work with doesn't do any work.

34
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:49,741
It's like,
well,

35
00:01:49,741 --> 00:01:51,580
you could do it.
I mean,

36
00:01:51,581 --> 00:01:54,850
I know there's limits to that,
but one of the things you can do at work

37
00:01:54,851 --> 00:01:56,980
is make yourself indispensable.
I mean,

38
00:01:56,981 --> 00:02:00,700
you might get the cane types against you
if you do that,

39
00:02:00,701 --> 00:02:04,240
but there's something to be said for
being indispensable because when people

40
00:02:04,241 --> 00:02:08,140
start to be dispensed with,
you've probably won't be one of them.

41
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:11,110
Or even if you are,
then the fact that you're indispensable

42
00:02:11,111 --> 00:02:13,300
just means you can go somewhere else and
be indispensable.

43
00:02:13,301 --> 00:02:15,190
They're not.
It's just as useful.

44
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:20,640
So it's very,
very difficult to permanently put down

45
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:25,810
someone who's really good at doing
things because they can just go off and

46
00:02:25,811 --> 00:02:28,900
do them somewhere else.
And one of the ways that you get like

47
00:02:28,901 --> 00:02:33,901
that is to take responsibility when
someone else is failing to do so.

48
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:35,021
And you think,
well,

49
00:02:35,021 --> 00:02:37,390
I shouldn't have to do that.
That's one way of thinking about it.

50
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,340
Another way of thinking about it is,
oh good,

51
00:02:39,341 --> 00:02:40,300
I get to do that.
