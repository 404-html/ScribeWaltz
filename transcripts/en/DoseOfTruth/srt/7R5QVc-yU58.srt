00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:05,100
Right.
Hello Dr. I am a 23 year old male with

2
00:00:09,111 --> 00:00:11,090
paranoid schizophrenia.
However,

3
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:13,760
I feel like controlling 95 percent of
it.

4
00:00:13,761 --> 00:00:15,490
Okay,
so let's say I think you mean that

5
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:19,280
you're controlling 95 percent of it.
I desire to seek a partner,

6
00:00:19,281 --> 00:00:23,540
but I am afraid how to reveal it.
Any advice on how to approach it?

7
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:25,370
Oh God.
Steven,

8
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:30,330
that's a really hard question.
Well,

9
00:00:30,331 --> 00:00:32,640
look,
you're not under any obligation when you

10
00:00:32,641 --> 00:00:37,641
first meet someone to drown them in
information about your identity.

11
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:43,970
So I would say
the devil's in the details.

12
00:00:43,991 --> 00:00:47,170
Fundamentally,
if you have a relationship with someone

13
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:50,650
and it's progressing and you're being
honest,

14
00:00:50,651 --> 00:00:54,040
my suspicions are that it will come up
with its own accord.

15
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:55,940
You know,
that you'll be able to tell in the

16
00:00:55,941 --> 00:00:59,950
situation when the right way to
introduce it is,

17
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:01,111
um,
you know,

18
00:01:01,111 --> 00:01:03,040
if,
if you're asking me this because you've

19
00:01:03,041 --> 00:01:05,800
been in a relationship for a long time
and you haven't revealed it,

20
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:11,250
then I don't know what to tell you about
that because an [inaudible] I wouldn't

21
00:01:11,651 --> 00:01:14,020
give someone general advice about that.
You know,

22
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:14,913
if,
uh,

23
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:21,020
sorry
if I,

24
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:23,900
if are we speaking to a client and I had
some real

25
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:28,250
detailed information about their current
situation,

26
00:01:28,251 --> 00:01:30,920
I would sit down and help them
strategize about that.

27
00:01:31,010 --> 00:01:34,250
Ask about the person you're telling.
Figure out how long you've gone out with

28
00:01:34,251 --> 00:01:36,530
them,
figure out a way that it might be

29
00:01:36,531 --> 00:01:38,450
revealed that you would be comfortable
with.

30
00:01:38,451 --> 00:01:43,451
I suspect probably what you should do is
find someone you trust to talk about it.

31
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:46,610
If you're already in a relationship,
and if you're not,

32
00:01:46,611 --> 00:01:50,600
then assume that if going into the
relationship,

33
00:01:50,601 --> 00:01:54,440
your basic goal is honesty.
That you'll handle it appropriately.

34
00:01:54,441 --> 00:01:55,850
When the situation comes up.
