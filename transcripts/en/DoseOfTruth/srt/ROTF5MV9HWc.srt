1
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:27,290
[inaudible]

2
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:36,913
well it's,

3
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:37,861
it's stressful.

4
00:00:37,861 --> 00:00:39,520
I suppose in some ways it'd be,

5
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:40,440
um,

6
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:41,130
these,

7
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:42,270
I don't find these,

8
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:45,930
these parks particularly stressful
because they're so positive.

9
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:47,370
You know,

10
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:51,240
I like to come up and talk about
the things that I've learned

11
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:57,940
a few people here and to have a serious
discussion about things that would help

12
00:00:58,321 --> 00:01:02,400
orient us in the world and to
push what I know farther ahead.

13
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,740
So that's,

14
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:09,250
it's so positive that I don't
really think about this.

15
00:01:09,251 --> 00:01:13,410
Certainly this part of it that stressful
facing journalists is stressful.

16
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:16,290
No,

17
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:17,573
usually

18
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:20,440
and so,

19
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:21,273
um,

20
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:25,950
I don't know how I have mine from that
or you should go sleep afterwards I guess

21
00:01:25,951 --> 00:01:26,784
is what I do.

22
00:01:27,010 --> 00:01:27,540
That helps.

23
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:28,373
That's helpful.

24
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:29,573
Um,

25
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:30,720
what I do to

26
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:37,590
increase my ability to tolerate
the activities that I'm engaged in,

27
00:01:37,591 --> 00:01:41,790
this drama with my wife and she's
extremely helpful cause she's very level

28
00:01:41,791 --> 00:01:42,624
headed.

29
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:47,780
I have an extra brain along which is a
useful thing and we sweat sometimes we

30
00:01:48,431 --> 00:01:49,340
the workout with him.

31
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:53,100
Sometimes we go for a drive when we can
do that and we go for a walk and I spend

32
00:01:53,101 --> 00:01:54,060
time with my family.

33
00:01:54,061 --> 00:01:54,840
And,

34
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:55,673
um,

35
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:58,020
those are all good things,

36
00:01:58,710 --> 00:01:59,543
but I go,

37
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:01,950
life is stressful.

38
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:03,120
So,

39
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:08,120
and at least I'm in a position where
whatever I'm doing new stressful is

40
00:02:08,971 --> 00:02:12,630
counterbalanced by exactly what
that talk from all of you tonight.

41
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:13,473
I,

42
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,190
it's deep.

43
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:15,240
What I'm doing,

44
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:17,400
what I'm engaged in is deeply meaningful.

45
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:24,110
And so it's a pleasure to be able to
share that with other people and to see

46
00:02:24,391 --> 00:02:28,800
that sense of meaningful
engagement and develop more people.

47
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:32,010
And it,

48
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:34,290
I can't think of anything
better to do than that,

49
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:37,260
which is why I'm doing
what I'm doing tonight,

50
00:02:37,261 --> 00:02:37,930
for example,

51
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:42,660
because I can't think of anything better
than sitting here and talking to all of

52
00:02:42,661 --> 00:02:47,661
you about these things that are necessary
to understand and to lay out in the

53
00:02:47,911 --> 00:02:48,660
world.

54
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:49,493
And so

55
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:53,400
what do I do to unwind?

56
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:58,410
I think I do what you shouldn't
do if you want to unwind.

57
00:02:58,620 --> 00:02:59,290
I,

58
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:01,410
I'm trying my best to make things better

59
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:07,010
because it seems to me that would be
better than this thing with feathers.

60
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:13,830
And I have some sense of how bad things
can be because I've studied how bad

61
00:03:13,831 --> 00:03:17,520
things can be experienced
in my own personal life.

62
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:22,200
Some of them with my clients because
I've been in very dark places with my

63
00:03:22,201 --> 00:03:25,440
clients and in my own
life from time to time,

64
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:28,050
certainly in my studies.

65
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:33,070
And I grabbed him that everything did
you go to hell in a hand basket like in

66
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:33,913
code?

67
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:39,120
And I would like it if everyone got on
the board and we all decided to make

68
00:03:39,751 --> 00:03:40,740
things better.

69
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:45,830
Each of us started with our own
lives and facilitating that is

70
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:50,130
the afternoon to the catastrophe.

71
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:55,180
So that's a continual
unwinding in a sense.

72
00:03:56,050 --> 00:03:56,530
So,

73
00:03:56,530 --> 00:04:01,530
and it's a privilege to be able to take
part in m to also see this amazing thing

74
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:06,310
we developed in for a long time.

75
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:09,070
And now I started doing these lectures.

76
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:13,120
Public lectures would be last
year I did a series on the Bible.

77
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:16,360
I thought it was really at that because,

78
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:17,590
um,

79
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:21,430
well think about it is I decided
to do a series of lectures.

80
00:04:21,431 --> 00:04:25,180
So I rented this theater and I
decided that I wanted to do lectures.

81
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:29,010
On Genesis sections of
what responsibilities,

82
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:30,340
starting with genesis.

83
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:34,950
And then I would do that publicly and
then a whole bunch of people came,

84
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:36,091
no one.

85
00:04:36,091 --> 00:04:37,120
So that was pretty weird.

86
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:38,970
That young man's where exactly.

87
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:40,900
If not the people who
would ever to do that.

88
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:46,990
Lots of people have to 1,000,002 and
a half million people have watched the

89
00:04:46,991 --> 00:04:47,920
first of those lectures.

90
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:50,530
It's on the first sentence of Genesis.

91
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51,890
So to mount to an,

92
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:56,770
and people have watched for three
hour lecture on one sentence

93
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:00,570
from the first story in the Bible.

94
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:01,780
It's completely ridiculous.

95
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:05,810
When I went home,

96
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:10,630
launched the publicists in London,

97
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:14,560
rented and speaker so that I can
talk about it sold out right away.

98
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:18,460
So then they rented number one for the
next day and it's sold out right away

99
00:05:18,461 --> 00:05:19,810
until they read one the next week.

100
00:05:19,811 --> 00:05:20,950
And it's salt though too.

101
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:23,350
And then the same thing
happened in Amsterdam.

102
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:25,060
And then I thought,

103
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:26,770
well that's interesting.

104
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:28,970
So about 15 zero units,

105
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:34,500
50 theatrical performances
in Toronto and in Europe.

106
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:38,230
I can probably go wherever it wants the
world and we'll talk about what I want

107
00:05:38,231 --> 00:05:38,711
to talk about,

108
00:05:38,711 --> 00:05:39,840
how much people will come.

109
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:40,960
So I thought,

110
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:41,051
well,

111
00:05:41,051 --> 00:05:42,160
I might as well try that.

112
00:05:42,161 --> 00:05:42,994
That's

113
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:51,070
my wife and I have been in,

114
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:54,100
I think this is the 58
city in four months.

115
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:57,040
And so here you all are.

116
00:05:57,150 --> 00:06:02,120
We're having a very serious
conversation is properly in the world.

117
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:04,970
And so that's not stressful,

118
00:06:04,971 --> 00:06:05,240
man.

119
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,560
That's great.

120
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:10,340
So it compared,

121
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:17,050
there's so much worth catastrophe in
the world to be involved in a continual

122
00:06:19,341 --> 00:06:23,510
conversation with thousands of people
about how each of our individual lives

123
00:06:23,511 --> 00:06:27,350
might be better and how that
could spread into our families,

124
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:29,210
into the broader community.

125
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:30,800
It's like that's not stressful.

126
00:06:30,801 --> 00:06:32,420
That's the opposite of stressful.

127
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:34,190
It's great.

128
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:34,940
Wonderful.

129
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:35,840
It's so positive.

130
00:06:35,841 --> 00:06:37,070
I can't believe it.

131
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:37,963
You know,

132
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:41,660
I was talking to my son
the other day this morning,

133
00:06:41,661 --> 00:06:42,494
I think,

134
00:06:42,690 --> 00:06:47,690
and it was this morning
[inaudible] he gave,

135
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:51,430
he gave to the pay with tabby and I,

136
00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:55,010
and we had a hell of a
trip man from New York,

137
00:06:55,011 --> 00:06:55,521
from Dublin,

138
00:06:55,521 --> 00:06:56,540
and then to London.

139
00:06:57,110 --> 00:07:00,880
And so in Dublin I talked to
Sam Harris and Douglas Murray,

140
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:05,540
8,500 people showed up wearing this
big stadium was like the biggest

141
00:07:05,541 --> 00:07:06,920
philosophical discussion.

142
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:09,680
I think it was the biggest
public philosophical discussion,

143
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:14,740
not like close it [inaudible] if it
was that would be the biggest event.

144
00:07:18,571 --> 00:07:23,571
And that was like all these people
showed up cavernous Rena to him to hear a

145
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:29,030
very difficult discussion about the
relationship between facts and values and

146
00:07:29,031 --> 00:07:30,270
religion and science.

147
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:32,090
They were like right into,

148
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:32,810
you know,

149
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:36,200
we were going to switch to Q and
a after an hour of discussion,

150
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:38,630
but the audience voted overwhelmingly,

151
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:39,200
you know,

152
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,970
by clapping too,

153
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,490
to continue the conversations.

154
00:07:43,491 --> 00:07:46,510
And we talked for two and a half hours
and everyone was like right on the board.

155
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:50,270
And so it just turns out that people
are lot smarter than we thought.

156
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:51,320
There's a huge,

157
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:52,633
huge,

158
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:54,260
well I think TV,

159
00:07:54,261 --> 00:07:56,480
the narrow bandwidth of
TV maybe made a mistake.

160
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,340
We were stupid and we're actually not.

161
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:02,510
And so there's this massive
public hungered for detail and,

162
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,340
and,

163
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:06,550
and reasonably deep
philosophical discussions like,

164
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,120
well that's helping with leasing things.

165
00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:13,570
So that was just the one
belief [inaudible] we get that.

166
00:08:19,570 --> 00:08:20,930
And I was crazily exciting,

167
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:25,150
ridiculously adventurous and the
talk went really well and will take,

168
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:25,880
hopefully,

169
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:26,391
like I said,

170
00:08:26,391 --> 00:08:28,780
that the me in August and
that people can see what they,

171
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:32,630
and when there was a discussion about
the relative merits of an atheist

172
00:08:32,631 --> 00:08:33,790
materialist viewpoint,

173
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:36,530
let's call it cultural
religious traditions,

174
00:08:36,531 --> 00:08:38,780
religious viewpoint.

175
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,670
And we had a good discussion.

176
00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:43,610
We consider yourself both
sides of that argument.

177
00:08:43,611 --> 00:08:44,210
And then,

178
00:08:44,210 --> 00:08:44,450
you know,

179
00:08:44,450 --> 00:08:47,420
with any luck and a couple of billion
people will watch those videos and they

180
00:08:47,421 --> 00:08:50,330
can have a discussion about it and they
do the concern himself up property.

181
00:08:50,331 --> 00:08:55,331
And then we went to London and did the
same thing again along with a variety of

182
00:08:57,570 --> 00:08:58,710
other activities.

183
00:08:59,370 --> 00:08:59,851
Like I said,

184
00:08:59,851 --> 00:09:04,280
I was talking to my son about this
morning and he's a pretty tough kid and

185
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:05,540
pretty levelheaded.

186
00:09:05,690 --> 00:09:06,880
And when he was talking about it,

187
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:09,750
it made him broke down
at the rate of crime.

188
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:10,980
And you know,

189
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:14,370
and the reason for that is because it's
absolutely overwhelming to watch this

190
00:09:14,371 --> 00:09:14,761
happen.

191
00:09:14,761 --> 00:09:16,140
I can't believe.

192
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:17,760
So it's not stressful.

193
00:09:17,761 --> 00:09:18,140
It's,

194
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:18,973
it's,

195
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:21,860
it's a privilege to be doing this.

196
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:22,703
It's an ounce,

197
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:23,180
lucky,

198
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:28,180
privileged to be doing this
and that sold [inaudible].
