1
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:08,571
I get striked,

2
00:00:08,571 --> 00:00:12,000
I've heard depressed people who stopped
antidepressants 70 never helped in the

3
00:00:12,001 --> 00:00:12,631
first place.

4
00:00:12,631 --> 00:00:13,620
What do you say to that,

5
00:00:13,621 --> 00:00:14,454
Mr. Peterson?

6
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:14,791
Hey,

7
00:00:14,791 --> 00:00:15,270
that,

8
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:16,440
that's certainly possible.

9
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:17,703
Um,

10
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:21,030
antidepressants don't
necessarily work for everyone.

11
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:26,210
My personal opinion is
that antidepressants work
quite well for many people

12
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:30,690
whose lives are in decent order.

13
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:32,280
So they have friends,

14
00:00:32,281 --> 00:00:33,720
they have family that loved them,

15
00:00:33,721 --> 00:00:34,800
they have a career,

16
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:38,610
they're educated approximately to
the level of their intelligence.

17
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,290
They have things to look forward to,

18
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:43,530
but for some reason their
mood is extremely distorted.

19
00:00:43,531 --> 00:00:44,220
M and,

20
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:45,053
and negative.

21
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:49,470
And I've seen antidepressants have
miraculous effects on people like that.

22
00:00:49,471 --> 00:00:54,471
I think they're less likely to work
when people have a plethora of life

23
00:00:54,811 --> 00:00:55,620
problems,

24
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:57,990
which isn't exactly
the same thing as being

25
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:00,863
depressed.

26
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:02,160
You know,

27
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:05,640
like you've been having a terrible
life is not the same thing as being

28
00:01:05,641 --> 00:01:06,474
depressed.

29
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:07,860
Although the two can overlap.

30
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:10,350
And it isn't obvious
to me that people who,

31
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:10,681
you know,

32
00:01:10,681 --> 00:01:13,680
maybe they have a drinking problem
or a drug abuse problem and they're

33
00:01:13,681 --> 00:01:18,510
unemployed and they have a pathological
family and their friends aren't good for

34
00:01:18,511 --> 00:01:18,751
them.

35
00:01:18,751 --> 00:01:19,410
And,

36
00:01:19,410 --> 00:01:20,243
um,

37
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:20,701
you know,

38
00:01:20,701 --> 00:01:20,991
they,

39
00:01:20,991 --> 00:01:21,220
they,

40
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:24,360
they have a string of failures behind
them and they don't have much to look

41
00:01:24,361 --> 00:01:25,950
forward to in the future and all that.

42
00:01:25,951 --> 00:01:26,490
It's,

43
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:28,670
it's a lot for an antidepressant overcome.

44
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:30,210
But under those circumstances,

45
00:01:30,211 --> 00:01:35,211
maybe the antidepressants can help stave
off feelings of like suicidal feelings

46
00:01:35,881 --> 00:01:36,720
and that sort of thing.

47
00:01:36,721 --> 00:01:39,120
But antidepressants
don't work for everyone,

48
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:42,360
but some people they work really well for.

49
00:01:42,361 --> 00:01:43,290
And if you're depressed,

50
00:01:43,291 --> 00:01:44,820
they're definitely worth a try.

51
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:45,421
You know,

52
00:01:45,421 --> 00:01:46,920
in a month if they're going to work.

53
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:47,851
Also,

54
00:01:47,851 --> 00:01:51,150
there are a variety of different kinds
of antidepressants and you have to figure

55
00:01:51,151 --> 00:01:54,270
up dose and you have to figure out when
you should take them during the day and

56
00:01:54,271 --> 00:01:54,421
you,

57
00:01:54,421 --> 00:01:55,830
and you have to figure out tight.

58
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:57,030
So they're,

59
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:01,620
they're not a cure or they're a tool
for helping control negative emotion and

60
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:02,850
they can be very effective.

61
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:03,601
So,

62
00:02:03,601 --> 00:02:06,360
but that doesn't mean that there
aren't people that they didn't help.

63
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,700
So that's what I would say about that.
