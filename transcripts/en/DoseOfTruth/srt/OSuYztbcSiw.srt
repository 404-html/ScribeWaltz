1
00:00:06,590 --> 00:00:07,371
The problem is,

2
00:00:07,371 --> 00:00:07,821
and this is,

3
00:00:07,821 --> 00:00:09,830
this actually speaks to
what people are like.

4
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:10,730
Um,

5
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:11,680
benefit is fine.

6
00:00:11,681 --> 00:00:12,800
Like risk is infinite.

7
00:00:13,850 --> 00:00:14,683
You can die.

8
00:00:14,810 --> 00:00:15,980
You can only be so happy.

9
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:16,881
You know,

10
00:00:16,881 --> 00:00:18,170
like you can be really happy.

11
00:00:18,171 --> 00:00:18,431
Yeah,

12
00:00:18,431 --> 00:00:18,920
yeah.

13
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:23,920
You can be like just 100% dead and
you're actually kind of wired that way

14
00:00:24,321 --> 00:00:29,321
because people are more sensitive to
negative events than deposit of events.

15
00:00:29,601 --> 00:00:34,601
So a loss will hurt you more than a gain
of the same magnitude will please you.

16
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:37,010
So in that,

17
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:39,770
the reason I'm saying that is because
it shows you that we're actually set up

18
00:00:39,771 --> 00:00:40,820
for a risky world.

19
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:44,540
Our nervous systems are tuned to be
more sensitive to negative information

20
00:00:44,541 --> 00:00:46,040
because the world's so damn risky.

21
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:50,900
Now we'd be completely hiding like
a nocturnal animal except that,

22
00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:51,170
you know,

23
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:52,490
we figured out ways to

24
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:55,280
make risk value.

25
00:00:55,970 --> 00:00:58,190
So we were ambivalent creatures.

26
00:00:58,580 --> 00:00:59,090
You know,

27
00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:02,570
we were thrilled by opportunity to
get terrified by it at the same time,

28
00:01:02,571 --> 00:01:03,600
which is exactly what,

29
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:04,723
how it should be.

30
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:07,520
Risk is everywhere.

31
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:09,830
That's the first truth of Buddhism,

32
00:01:09,831 --> 00:01:10,664
right?

33
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:12,140
Suffering is inevitable.

34
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:13,220
Life is suffering.

35
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:13,880
Same thing.

36
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:14,720
Risk is everywhere.

37
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:15,673
Life is suffering,

38
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:16,873
period.

39
00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:18,463
So you know,

40
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:19,580
partly when you're saying,

41
00:01:19,581 --> 00:01:19,731
well,

42
00:01:19,731 --> 00:01:22,220
can you regulate the collapse
of these macro systems?

43
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:22,911
You're saying,

44
00:01:22,911 --> 00:01:23,071
well,

45
00:01:23,071 --> 00:01:24,230
can you eliminate risks?

46
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:24,471
Well,

47
00:01:24,471 --> 00:01:25,280
no,

48
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:26,113
you can't.

49
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:27,081
I don't think,

50
00:01:27,081 --> 00:01:27,710
in fact,

51
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:28,580
you could argue.

52
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:30,531
I shouldn't say that.

53
00:01:30,531 --> 00:01:30,861
Exactly.

54
00:01:30,861 --> 00:01:33,230
I think there is one way
that you can minimize risk.

55
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:34,970
Don't be crooked.

56
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:38,390
The less crooked your society is,

57
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:40,160
the more you mitigate risks,

58
00:01:40,730 --> 00:01:41,720
but you can't eliminate.
