1
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:07,570
They jumped her Catalan,

2
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:07,981
their goods,

3
00:00:07,981 --> 00:00:10,620
which they had gotten in the land
of Canaan and came into Egypt,

4
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:13,250
Jacob and all his seed with them.

5
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:19,310
And he sent Judah before month
Joseph to direct his face under gosh.

6
00:00:19,311 --> 00:00:19,431
And,

7
00:00:19,431 --> 00:00:23,360
and they came into the land of Goshen and
Joseph Made ready his chariot and went

8
00:00:23,361 --> 00:00:24,111
to meet Israel,

9
00:00:24,111 --> 00:00:24,944
his father,

10
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:28,940
and presented himself to them and fell
on his neck and wept on his neck a good

11
00:00:28,941 --> 00:00:29,774
while.

12
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:30,830
And Israel said,

13
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:35,480
I can now die because I've seen your
face because you're still alive.

14
00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:42,590
And Pharaoh spake unto Joseph saying that
father and thy brethren are coming to

15
00:00:42,591 --> 00:00:42,881
the,

16
00:00:42,881 --> 00:00:45,710
and the land of Egypt is before
the and the best of the land.

17
00:00:45,711 --> 00:00:49,220
Your father and brothers can dwell in
the land of Gosh and let them dwell.

18
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:52,310
And if they're now no any
men of activity among them,

19
00:00:52,311 --> 00:00:53,990
then make them rulers over my cattle.

20
00:00:54,230 --> 00:00:55,063
It gives them a job.

21
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:56,870
And Joseph brought in Jacob,

22
00:00:56,871 --> 00:00:57,704
his father and said,

23
00:00:57,710 --> 00:01:00,470
and before Pharaoh and
Jacob Blessed Pharaoh.

24
00:01:01,490 --> 00:01:04,550
That's a very interesting little turn
of events because you'd expect the

25
00:01:04,551 --> 00:01:06,470
opposite under those circumstances.

26
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:07,843
So

27
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:13,590
it appears that Jacob was a man of
relatively great self possession.

28
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:14,873
Cause that's not an,

29
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:20,150
you wouldn't bless Queen Elizabeth in
all likelihood as you had a lot of gall.

30
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:22,440
And Pharaoh said unto Jacob,

31
00:01:22,441 --> 00:01:23,041
how old are you?

32
00:01:23,041 --> 00:01:23,880
And Jacob said,

33
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:25,800
I'm 130 years,

34
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:30,000
few and evil have been the days of the
years of my life and I've not attained

35
00:01:30,001 --> 00:01:31,440
unto the days of the years of my,

36
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:32,010
of my,

37
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:34,800
of the life of my fathers and
the days of their pilgrimage.

38
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:39,240
And Jacob Blessed Pharaoh and went out
from before Pharaoh and Israel dwelt in

39
00:01:39,241 --> 00:01:40,080
the land of Egypt,

40
00:01:40,081 --> 00:01:41,020
in the country of Gosh,

41
00:01:41,021 --> 00:01:41,151
and,

42
00:01:41,151 --> 00:01:44,130
and grew and multiplied exceedingly.

43
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:45,960
And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt,

44
00:01:45,961 --> 00:01:46,920
17 years.

45
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:50,620
So the whole age of Jacob was 147 years.

46
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:54,090
And the time drew nigh
that Israel must die.

47
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:54,931
And he called his son.

48
00:01:54,931 --> 00:01:56,100
Joseph had said unto him,

49
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:59,520
if I have now found grace in thy sight,

50
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:00,131
put,

51
00:02:00,131 --> 00:02:04,360
I pray thee thy hand under my thigh
and deal kindly and truly with me,

52
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:04,871
bury me.

53
00:02:04,871 --> 00:02:05,170
Not,

54
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:06,430
I pray thee in Egypt,

55
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:11,720
but I will lie with my fathers now shall
carry me out of Egypt and burry me and

56
00:02:11,721 --> 00:02:12,830
they're burying place.

57
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:14,931
And Joseph said,

58
00:02:14,931 --> 00:02:16,340
I will do as you've said.

59
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:21,330
And it came to pass after these
things that one told Joseph,

60
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,830
behold I father is sick.

61
00:02:22,831 --> 00:02:24,180
And he took with him his two sons,

62
00:02:24,181 --> 00:02:27,240
Madison FM and one told Jacob and said,

63
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:28,410
behold thy son.

64
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:30,330
And one told Jacob and said,

65
00:02:30,331 --> 00:02:31,141
behold thy son,

66
00:02:31,141 --> 00:02:35,280
Joseph Cometh unto Thee and Israel
strength in himself and sat upon the bed.

67
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:37,860
And Israel said unto Joseph,

68
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:42,890
I had not thought to see your face and
low God has also showed me your children.

69
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:47,850
And Joseph brought them out from between
his knees and out himself with his face

70
00:02:47,851 --> 00:02:48,361
to the earth.

71
00:02:48,361 --> 00:02:51,750
And Joseph took them both and for him
in his right hand towards Israel's

72
00:02:51,751 --> 00:02:52,870
lefthand and Madison,

73
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:55,770
his lefthand toward Israel's right
hand and brought them near unto him.

74
00:02:56,610 --> 00:03:00,070
And Israel stretched out his right hand
and laid it upon firms head who was the

75
00:03:00,071 --> 00:03:05,071
younger and his left hand upon Madison's
head guiding his hands purposefully for

76
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:06,610
Madison was the first board.

77
00:03:06,611 --> 00:03:10,110
And when Joseph saw that his father laid
his right hand on the head of the frame

78
00:03:10,111 --> 00:03:14,150
and displeased him and he held up as far
as hand to remove it from informs head

79
00:03:14,151 --> 00:03:15,490
onto [inaudible] head.

80
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:18,490
And Joseph said unto his father,

81
00:03:18,491 --> 00:03:18,761
not,

82
00:03:18,761 --> 00:03:19,001
not.

83
00:03:19,001 --> 00:03:23,470
So my father for this is the first board
put the right hand upon his head head

84
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:25,030
and his father refused and said,

85
00:03:25,031 --> 00:03:25,841
I know what my son,

86
00:03:25,841 --> 00:03:26,674
I know it.

87
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:29,860
He shall also become a people
and he shall also be great,

88
00:03:29,861 --> 00:03:33,850
but truly his younger brother shall be
greater than he and his seed shall become

89
00:03:33,851 --> 00:03:35,050
a multitude of nations.

90
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:38,560
Another repeat of the same
thing that happens continually.

91
00:03:38,561 --> 00:03:39,394
It's is when,

92
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:42,460
when God wants to
intervene in human affairs,

93
00:03:42,461 --> 00:03:44,050
what he does is invert tradition.

94
00:03:44,051 --> 00:03:45,130
It's something like that.

95
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:49,660
And so that's a sign that that there's
something new and special going on and

96
00:03:49,661 --> 00:03:52,720
that gives precedents to the younger
child rather than the older child

97
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:55,810
precedents to what is new
rather than what's traditional.

98
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:56,351
Of course,

99
00:03:56,351 --> 00:04:00,760
sometimes that's necessary because
tradition is insufficient and sometimes

100
00:04:00,761 --> 00:04:03,370
something new has to come into
being in order to update it.

101
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:06,400
And Jacob called together
his sons and said,

102
00:04:06,401 --> 00:04:10,870
gathered together so that I can tell you
that which shall be follow you in the

103
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:11,703
last days.

104
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:15,430
Gather yourself together and here you
sons of Jacob and hearken unto Israel,

105
00:04:15,431 --> 00:04:16,264
your father,

106
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:17,530
Ruben.

107
00:04:17,530 --> 00:04:19,900
I'm not going to go through
all 12 of these Reuben,

108
00:04:19,901 --> 00:04:20,261
thou art,

109
00:04:20,261 --> 00:04:21,070
my firstborn,

110
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:21,611
my might,

111
00:04:21,611 --> 00:04:23,020
and the beginning of my strength,

112
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:26,140
the Excellency of Dignity
and the Excellency of power.

113
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:27,693
Now

114
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:34,050
the story's quite interesting here because
Jacob Blesses Joseph's sons before he

115
00:04:35,321 --> 00:04:36,610
blesses it's old science.

116
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:42,390
And so what he's doing is placing the
rights of the first born into the sons of

117
00:04:43,841 --> 00:04:44,980
his favorite son,

118
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,780
and then he goes to his sons.

119
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:51,850
And so that has implications for the
way the biblical stories laid themselves

120
00:04:51,851 --> 00:04:53,560
out from thence forward

121
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:58,240
the excellence of dignity
in the Excellency of power,

122
00:04:58,241 --> 00:04:59,230
unstable as water.

123
00:04:59,231 --> 00:05:02,920
Thou shalt not excel because
that went up to thy father's bed,

124
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:03,820
then defiled it.

125
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:05,170
He went up to my couch.

126
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:08,200
You may remember that Ruben
slept with his fathers,

127
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:09,040
cucumber,

128
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:09,873
concubine,

129
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:13,240
Simeon and Levi are brethren.

130
00:05:13,241 --> 00:05:15,910
Instruments of cruelty
are in their habitations.

131
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:17,620
That painting there.

132
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:24,450
What happened with Simeon and Levi was
that somebody lay with their sister Dinah

133
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:33,060
and then offered to marry her and then
had and then he came circumcised because

134
00:05:33,671 --> 00:05:36,760
that was part of the deal and then how
to older men circumcised and then Simeon

135
00:05:36,761 --> 00:05:41,761
and Levi went in when they were recovering
and killed them all and then Jacob

136
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:46,720
and all his people had to leave because
all that irritated their relatives.

137
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:48,123
So

138
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:51,620
see me,

139
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:55,390
Simeon and Levi are brethren
the instruments of cruelty
or in their habitations.

140
00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:59,090
All my soul come out into their
secret unto their assembly,

141
00:05:59,091 --> 00:06:02,890
mine on or be not thou United for in
their anger they slew a man and in their

142
00:06:02,891 --> 00:06:05,210
self self will they dig down a wall,

143
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,440
curse be their anger.

144
00:06:06,441 --> 00:06:08,690
For it was fierce and their
route for it was cruel.

145
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,510
I will divide them in Jacob
and scattered them in Israel,

146
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:13,221
Judah,

147
00:06:13,221 --> 00:06:13,820
thou art.

148
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:17,640
He who my brother and shall praise I hand
shall be in the neck of dynamics that

149
00:06:17,641 --> 00:06:22,641
I father's children shall bow down before
the Judah is alliance welp from the

150
00:06:23,361 --> 00:06:23,691
prey.

151
00:06:23,691 --> 00:06:25,280
My son though art gone up,

152
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:26,570
he stooped down.

153
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:30,200
He couched as a lion and as an
old lion who shall rose him up.

154
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:33,080
The sceptre shall not depart from Judah,

155
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:37,490
nor a law giver from between his feet
until Shiloh camp and unto him shall the

156
00:06:37,491 --> 00:06:38,780
gathering of the people be.

157
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,400
Joseph is a fruitful bough,

158
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:47,060
even a fruitful bough by a well
whose branches run over the wall.

159
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:50,420
The archers have sorely grieved
him and shot at him and hated him,

160
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:54,800
but his bow abode in strength and the
arms of his hands were made strong by the

161
00:06:54,801 --> 00:06:56,450
hands of the mighty God of Jacob.

162
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:58,340
For then since the shepherd,

163
00:06:58,760 --> 00:06:59,780
the stone of Israel,

164
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,010
even by the god of my father,

165
00:07:04,011 --> 00:07:07,190
who she'll help the and by the Almighty
who shall bless thee with the blessings

166
00:07:07,191 --> 00:07:11,300
of heavens above blessings of the deep
that Liat under blessings of the beasts,

167
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:11,781
breasts,

168
00:07:11,781 --> 00:07:12,614
and of the womb.

169
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:16,760
The blessings of thy father have prevailed
above the blessings of my progenitors

170
00:07:16,761 --> 00:07:19,190
unto the utmost bound of
the everlasting hills.

171
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:23,360
They shall be on the head of Joseph and
on the crown of the head of him that was

172
00:07:23,361 --> 00:07:27,740
separate from his brother and all
these are the 12 tribes of Israel,

173
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:29,511
and this is it.

174
00:07:29,511 --> 00:07:31,430
That they're farther spake
unto them and blessed them.

175
00:07:31,431 --> 00:07:33,020
Everyone according to his blessing,

176
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:34,070
he blessed them.
