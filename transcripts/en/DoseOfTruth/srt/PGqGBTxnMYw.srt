1
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:13,510
We could say you're trying
to teach your child to talk,

2
00:00:13,511 --> 00:00:16,150
which of course you don't
do what you do to a child,

3
00:00:16,151 --> 00:00:16,990
just talk to it.

4
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:20,950
But it's very interesting because there
have been studies of how parents talk to

5
00:00:20,951 --> 00:00:25,951
children and what they do is always use
language that's slightly more complex

6
00:00:26,081 --> 00:00:27,580
than the child can understand.

7
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:29,200
And they do it automatically.

8
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:30,580
It's part of our,

9
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:32,320
what a in some sense,

10
00:00:32,321 --> 00:00:34,570
our innate knowledge
structure about language.

11
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:38,020
So you don't only use words
that the child understands,

12
00:00:38,290 --> 00:00:41,710
use words that they understand plus
a few words and phrases and sentence

13
00:00:41,711 --> 00:00:43,030
constructions that they don't.

14
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:45,220
And so that's sort of pulling them along.

15
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:50,140
And a Russian psychologist named the
Gods ski called that the zone of proximal

16
00:00:50,141 --> 00:00:53,590
development and the zone of
proximal development is that place.

17
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:58,450
Cause it's a place in the environment
where information flow into the psyche is

18
00:00:58,451 --> 00:00:59,290
maximized.

19
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:00,550
And that has to be.

20
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:01,421
So it has to be,

21
00:01:01,421 --> 00:01:03,190
cause I comprehensible,

22
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:03,671
you know,

23
00:01:03,671 --> 00:01:05,410
it's something I tried
to do in my lectures.

24
00:01:05,411 --> 00:01:05,681
You know,

25
00:01:05,681 --> 00:01:09,760
I tried to tell you things that you know
and associate them with things that you

26
00:01:09,761 --> 00:01:10,271
don't know,

27
00:01:10,271 --> 00:01:12,820
so that you're not swamped,

28
00:01:12,821 --> 00:01:15,820
hopefully by an excess of
incomprehensible information,

29
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:16,841
but you don't think,

30
00:01:16,841 --> 00:01:17,381
Oh God,

31
00:01:17,381 --> 00:01:18,191
he's saying that again.

32
00:01:18,191 --> 00:01:19,150
I already know that,

33
00:01:19,151 --> 00:01:19,451
you know,

34
00:01:19,451 --> 00:01:19,861
et Cetera,

35
00:01:19,861 --> 00:01:20,680
et cetera.

36
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:21,513
And uh,

37
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:24,810
anything that's dramatic
instructure is doing that for you.

38
00:01:24,811 --> 00:01:25,330
It's keeping them,

39
00:01:25,330 --> 00:01:27,250
it's keeping you on the edge of attention.

40
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:31,960
And that place is where your
adaptation is maximized.

41
00:01:31,961 --> 00:01:36,490
Because not only are you firming up the
structure that's underneath your feet,

42
00:01:36,491 --> 00:01:38,110
you're relying on it and you know,

43
00:01:38,111 --> 00:01:38,321
it's,

44
00:01:38,321 --> 00:01:40,360
it's part of the platform
on which you stand,

45
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:45,160
but you're absorbing information at a
rate that allows you to increase the

46
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:50,220
solidity and area of that solid ground
without undermining you so much that it

47
00:01:52,001 --> 00:01:53,320
falls apart beneath you.

48
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,300
So it's lovely.

49
00:01:55,301 --> 00:01:59,050
It's such a good idea because think
about what it would mean if it was true.

50
00:01:59,051 --> 00:02:03,880
It would mean that if you pay attention
to what captures your interest and you

51
00:02:03,881 --> 00:02:04,840
follow that,

52
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:07,480
that means you're going to always
be interested in what you're doing.

53
00:02:07,481 --> 00:02:08,620
But even better than that,

54
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:12,520
it's going to mean that you're going to
maximize your adaptive capacity as much

55
00:02:12,521 --> 00:02:15,220
as possible at exactly the same time,

56
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:15,941
man,

57
00:02:15,941 --> 00:02:18,250
that'd be a great deal if it
actually happened to be true.

58
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:23,280
Now it's a bit complicated because
what culture wants from you and what is

59
00:02:24,371 --> 00:02:26,260
intrinsically interesting to you,

60
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:27,850
there's going to be a conflict there,

61
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:28,181
right?

62
00:02:28,181 --> 00:02:32,230
Because culture wants you to do what
a good cultural entity should do,

63
00:02:32,231 --> 00:02:34,000
which is to do what you're told to do,

64
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:35,800
but you're not,

65
00:02:35,801 --> 00:02:36,041
you know,

66
00:02:36,041 --> 00:02:37,120
you're not a robot.

67
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:41,170
And so part of the existential problem
that you have in life is trying to figure

68
00:02:41,171 --> 00:02:46,171
out some compromise between what you find
personally engaging and that develops

69
00:02:47,471 --> 00:02:51,190
and supports you and what
the culture will provide,

70
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,313
uh,

71
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:54,520
resources to you for pursuing.

72
00:02:54,730 --> 00:02:55,960
And it's hard.

73
00:02:55,961 --> 00:02:57,250
There's no simple answer to it.

74
00:02:57,610 --> 00:03:02,610
But I say that if you sacrifice your,

75
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:08,040
your capacity to engage in meaningful
activity to the security of a given

76
00:03:08,261 --> 00:03:09,820
position and a dominance hierarchy,

77
00:03:09,821 --> 00:03:11,890
then you turn into something
that's like a soul,

78
00:03:11,891 --> 00:03:12,730
a slave.

79
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,930
And that's a really bad idea because
there's no way you can do that for any

80
00:03:16,931 --> 00:03:19,510
length of time without
getting bored and resentful.

81
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:21,610
And once your board and resentful,

82
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:24,310
the move from that to dangerous is a very,

83
00:03:24,311 --> 00:03:25,630
very small step.

84
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:30,070
So it's hard and it isn't even necessarily
the case that you're going to make

85
00:03:30,071 --> 00:03:30,970
the balance.

86
00:03:30,971 --> 00:03:32,290
You know you're going
to mail to manage it,

87
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:33,730
but if you don't,

88
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,740
you're going to pay a
massive price for it.

89
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:37,000
So I would say,

90
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:37,780
you know,

91
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:38,171
let,

92
00:03:38,171 --> 00:03:42,280
don't let people mess around with what
you find compelling any more than is

93
00:03:42,281 --> 00:03:43,660
absolutely necessary.

94
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:44,710
You know,

95
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:47,710
so because it's very dangerous to do that,

96
00:03:47,711 --> 00:03:48,970
it's very dangerous to do that.

97
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:52,630
Just like it's dangerous not to find a
position in the dominance hierarchy at

98
00:03:52,631 --> 00:03:55,570
all because then you end
up in a chaotic place.

99
00:03:55,571 --> 00:03:57,350
And my experience being you,

100
00:03:57,351 --> 00:03:58,480
you might wonder about this,

101
00:03:58,481 --> 00:04:02,590
it's like what's the probability
that someone can live a healthy life,

102
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:03,431
healthy,

103
00:04:03,431 --> 00:04:04,001
productive,

104
00:04:04,001 --> 00:04:06,970
and stable life outside
of dominance hierarchy.

105
00:04:06,971 --> 00:04:08,530
So without external structure.

106
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:13,000
And the answer to that is there might be
one person in this class that could do

107
00:04:13,001 --> 00:04:13,480
that.

108
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:17,530
It's really hard because what happens to
most people is that if they don't have

109
00:04:17,770 --> 00:04:21,040
a substantial amount of
external structure and routine,

110
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:22,420
they just fall apart.

111
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:24,070
They don't sleep properly,

112
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,450
they don't eat properly,

113
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:25,931
you know,

114
00:04:25,931 --> 00:04:26,890
they're depressed.

115
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:31,570
It's tremendously effortful to continually
reinvent yourself day after day.

116
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:32,920
And so there's some real,

117
00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:37,060
there's some real utility in
routine and social identity,

118
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:37,631
you know,

119
00:04:37,631 --> 00:04:42,340
and young would say the part of you that
has adapted to re routine and social

120
00:04:42,341 --> 00:04:47,050
identity is the persona and sort of the
mask you wear in public and might even

121
00:04:47,051 --> 00:04:48,310
be who you think you are.

122
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:51,040
And he thought that people
who were only persona,

123
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:55,870
we're dangerous because they were only
thoughtless advocates of the system for

124
00:04:55,871 --> 00:04:57,040
which they stood.

125
00:04:57,370 --> 00:05:01,240
But he also believed that PR people
who had no persona where in an equally

126
00:05:01,241 --> 00:05:06,040
terrible situation because
they're psychologically
chaotic and they don't have a

127
00:05:06,041 --> 00:05:10,570
social structure around them to hem them
in and continually remind them how to

128
00:05:10,571 --> 00:05:11,920
be sane and productive.

129
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:13,870
So it's a matter of balance.

130
00:05:13,871 --> 00:05:14,500
You know,

131
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:14,800
there's,

132
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:19,000
there's horrors on both sides and
there's advantages on both sides.

133
00:05:19,001 --> 00:05:23,650
And the trick is to place yourself in a
location where you're deriving maximum

134
00:05:23,651 --> 00:05:24,910
advantage from both.

135
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:26,470
And you'll be able to tell if you do that.

136
00:05:26,471 --> 00:05:27,820
Because if you are doing that,

137
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:31,480
you're going to find your life
engaging and meaningful enough.

138
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:36,370
So the fact that it's also tragic and
potentially composed at least partially of

139
00:05:36,371 --> 00:05:37,204
slavery,

140
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:38,860
is going to be acceptable.

141
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:40,121
And that's what,

142
00:05:40,121 --> 00:05:41,710
that's the goal in some sense.

143
00:05:41,711 --> 00:05:42,730
It's a hard to do that,

144
00:05:42,731 --> 00:05:43,750
but you know,

145
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:45,280
it's hard not to do it too.

146
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:46,960
So you're screwed either way.

147
00:05:46,961 --> 00:05:50,530
So you might as well pick the path that's
going to be of maximum utility to you.
