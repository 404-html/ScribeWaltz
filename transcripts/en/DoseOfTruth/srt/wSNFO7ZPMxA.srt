1
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:08,580
One of the things that
happens to Joseph is that,

2
00:00:08,770 --> 00:00:08,981
well,

3
00:00:08,981 --> 00:00:13,500
a lot of bad things happened to them
because he's the favorite of his father.

4
00:00:13,501 --> 00:00:14,520
His brothers hate him.

5
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:17,430
And so the first they're
going to throw him in a pit.

6
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:18,960
I think they do throw him in a pit.

7
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:21,090
Then they sell them to be a slave.

8
00:00:21,091 --> 00:00:23,520
Then he ends up in what
we go through the story.

9
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:28,050
He ends up some places where you probably
wouldn't want to go prison being one

10
00:00:28,051 --> 00:00:28,884
of them,

11
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:30,143
but

12
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:33,900
it doesn't matter because even
when they put him in prison,

13
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:35,910
he's actually not in prison.

14
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:39,120
He just figures out how to make
the prison work way better.

15
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:41,190
And then he's in control of the prison.

16
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:42,780
And it's really,

17
00:00:42,781 --> 00:00:43,620
it's an interesting,

18
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:45,420
I had this friend,

19
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:46,590
you know,

20
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:48,360
and he was very smart,

21
00:00:48,361 --> 00:00:49,320
but very cynical,

22
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:54,620
and he wasn't employed very well and he
got a little older than he should have

23
00:00:54,871 --> 00:00:58,590
given his level of
intelligence and employability.

24
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:01,590
And so he had to take jobs that weren't
very intellectually challenging.

25
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:02,371
You know,

26
00:01:02,371 --> 00:01:06,300
and one of the things I tried to convince
him of was that even if he worked,

27
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:10,650
he wanted to work behind the parts
department in an automotive store cause he

28
00:01:10,651 --> 00:01:12,600
liked cars but it was beneath him.

29
00:01:12,601 --> 00:01:13,434
You know,

30
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:14,273
cause it was sort of a,

31
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:16,260
as far as he was concerned,

32
00:01:16,261 --> 00:01:17,094
it was a,

33
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:19,560
he was too smart for a job like that,

34
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:21,360
which actually turned out not to be true.

35
00:01:21,361 --> 00:01:23,880
He wasn't smart enough for a job
like that or he wasn't wise enough.

36
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:24,541
But you know,

37
00:01:24,541 --> 00:01:24,750
I,

38
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:28,590
one of the things I tried to tell them
was that you're looking at the situation

39
00:01:28,591 --> 00:01:32,820
wrong because even in a simple
job so called simple job,

40
00:01:32,821 --> 00:01:34,950
like let's say dishwashing
in a restaurant,

41
00:01:34,951 --> 00:01:36,030
which I did an awful lot of,

42
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:37,290
it's not that simple.

43
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:39,990
You're dealing with a lot of other people,

44
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:41,670
very fast staff changeover,

45
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:42,630
you're feeding people,

46
00:01:42,631 --> 00:01:44,790
you're helping them have a celebration,

47
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:47,940
you're helping them take a break.

48
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,310
Like you can do it really well and then
the kitchen can operate properly and

49
00:01:52,311 --> 00:01:54,020
then people can come
out to the restaurant.

50
00:01:54,021 --> 00:01:55,360
It's not a bloody catastrophe.

51
00:01:55,790 --> 00:01:56,990
Like you're,

52
00:01:57,050 --> 00:01:59,570
even when you're doing
something that's a menial job,

53
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:00,381
so to speak,

54
00:02:00,381 --> 00:02:01,250
like dishwashing,

55
00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:03,320
there are ways of doing it really badly,

56
00:02:03,321 --> 00:02:06,830
resentfully and horribly
and doing it really well.

57
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,360
And as soon as you do it really well,

58
00:02:08,361 --> 00:02:09,740
it's not a menial job anymore.

59
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:09,900
It,

60
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:12,140
it immediately transformed.

61
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:12,411
No,

62
00:02:12,411 --> 00:02:12,651
I mean,

63
00:02:12,651 --> 00:02:16,920
you can be around people who won't let
that happen and you should go get another

64
00:02:16,921 --> 00:02:18,000
job if that's the case.

65
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:19,650
But if you do it properly,

66
00:02:19,651 --> 00:02:21,270
then it's not meaningful at all.

67
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:26,240
And that's also a good
way out of resentment.

68
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:26,691
You think,

69
00:02:26,691 --> 00:02:26,841
well,

70
00:02:26,841 --> 00:02:27,591
I've just got this,

71
00:02:27,591 --> 00:02:27,831
you know,

72
00:02:27,831 --> 00:02:28,581
two bit job.

73
00:02:28,581 --> 00:02:28,851
It's like,

74
00:02:28,851 --> 00:02:29,031
yeah,

75
00:02:29,031 --> 00:02:31,670
what if he did it as well
as you possibly could?

76
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:33,120
You know what would happen?

77
00:02:33,121 --> 00:02:33,301
Well,

78
00:02:33,301 --> 00:02:35,580
the first thing that would happen
is you'd get a lot smarter,

79
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:36,571
that's for sure.

80
00:02:36,571 --> 00:02:39,210
And that that's hardly a negative thing.
