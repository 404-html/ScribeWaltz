1
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:09,880
The agreeableness trait that
divides men and women most.

2
00:00:09,881 --> 00:00:13,230
There's three things that divide women
and men most particularly from the

3
00:00:13,231 --> 00:00:14,760
psychometric perspective.

4
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:17,340
One is that women are
more agreeable than men.

5
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:21,090
And so that seems to be the primary
maternal dimension as far as I can tell.

6
00:00:21,091 --> 00:00:22,260
It's associated with,

7
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:22,950
um,

8
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:24,600
a desire to avoid conflict.

9
00:00:24,601 --> 00:00:24,911
But it's,

10
00:00:24,911 --> 00:00:27,180
it's associated with
interpersonal closeness,

11
00:00:27,181 --> 00:00:27,841
compassion,

12
00:00:27,841 --> 00:00:28,674
politeness.

13
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:30,450
Women are reliably higher than men,

14
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:33,630
especially in the Scandinavian
countries and in the countries where

15
00:00:33,631 --> 00:00:35,910
egalitarianism has
progressed the farthest.

16
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:38,390
So that's where the differences maximize,

17
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,910
which is one of the things James Demora
pointed out quite correctly in his

18
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:43,290
infamous Google memo.

19
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:43,711
Okay.

20
00:00:43,711 --> 00:00:45,420
Women are higher in negative emotion.

21
00:00:45,421 --> 00:00:47,460
So that's anxiety and emotional pain,

22
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:50,700
that that difference is
approximately the same size.

23
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:51,211
And again,

24
00:00:51,211 --> 00:00:53,700
that maximizes any Galitary in societies,

25
00:00:53,701 --> 00:00:54,960
which is extremely interesting.

26
00:00:54,961 --> 00:00:58,860
And then the biggest difference is the
difference in interest between people and

27
00:00:58,861 --> 00:00:59,694
things.

28
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:02,670
And so women are more interested in
people and men are more interested in

29
00:01:02,671 --> 00:01:03,001
things,

30
00:01:03,001 --> 00:01:05,460
which goes along quite nicely
with your car anecdote.

31
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:10,850
But the thing about men interacting with
men again is that it isn't that they

32
00:01:11,341 --> 00:01:12,870
respect each other's viewpoints.

33
00:01:12,871 --> 00:01:14,100
That's not exactly right.

34
00:01:14,101 --> 00:01:15,450
What happens with a man,

35
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:20,570
and I know a lot of men that I would
regard is as remarkably tough people for

36
00:01:21,121 --> 00:01:22,080
one reason or another.

37
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:25,080
And everything you do with
them is a form of combat.

38
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:27,660
Like if you want your
viewpoint taken seriously,

39
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:31,560
often you have to yell them down and
like they're not going to stop talking

40
00:01:31,561 --> 00:01:33,180
unless you start talking over them.

41
00:01:33,181 --> 00:01:33,421
You know,

42
00:01:33,421 --> 00:01:33,900
and it's,

43
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:37,950
it's not like are automatically giving
respect to other men because that just

44
00:01:37,951 --> 00:01:38,641
doesn't happen.

45
00:01:38,641 --> 00:01:39,000
Instead,

46
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,230
the combat is there and it's
expected and one of the problems,

47
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:46,690
and so this is part of the reason
why I think men are bailing out of,

48
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:48,420
of so much of academia and,

49
00:01:48,421 --> 00:01:48,561
and,

50
00:01:48,561 --> 00:01:50,550
and maybe the academic world in general,

51
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:52,260
and maybe the world in general,

52
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:56,220
is that men actually don't have
any idea how to compete with women.

53
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:57,660
Because the problem is,

54
00:01:57,661 --> 00:02:01,050
is that if you unleash
yourself completely,

55
00:02:01,051 --> 00:02:02,250
then you're an absolute bully.

56
00:02:02,251 --> 00:02:06,900
And there's no doubt about that because
if men unleash themselves on other men,

57
00:02:06,901 --> 00:02:08,400
that can be pretty God damn brutal,

58
00:02:08,401 --> 00:02:10,910
especially for the men that
are really tough and this,

59
00:02:10,911 --> 00:02:12,600
so that just doesn't happen with women.

60
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:16,970
But so you can't unleash
yourself completely if you,

61
00:02:16,971 --> 00:02:17,930
when you're a bully,

62
00:02:17,931 --> 00:02:20,090
if you lose while you're
just bloody pathetic.

63
00:02:20,091 --> 00:02:22,670
So how the hell are you supposed
to play a game like that?

64
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:23,451
You know?

65
00:02:23,451 --> 00:02:24,140
So in,

66
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:27,980
I've worked with lots of women in
law firms and in Canada for example,

67
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:28,191
and,

68
00:02:28,191 --> 00:02:29,660
and high achieving women,

69
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:31,250
like really remarkable people,

70
00:02:31,251 --> 00:02:32,084
I would say.

71
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:34,550
And they're often nonplussed,

72
00:02:34,551 --> 00:02:38,330
I would say by the attitude of the man
in the law firm because they would like

73
00:02:38,331 --> 00:02:41,810
to see everyone pulling together because
they're all part of the same team,

74
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,840
whereas the manner like at
each other's throats in an,

75
00:02:44,841 --> 00:02:49,460
in a cooperative way because they
want the law firm to succeed,

76
00:02:49,461 --> 00:02:52,910
but they want to be the person who's
at the top of the success hierarchy.

77
00:02:52,911 --> 00:02:53,211
Right.

78
00:02:53,211 --> 00:02:53,720
So,

79
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:54,260
and that,

80
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:59,260
that doesn't jive well with
the more competitive or
cooperative ethos that's and

81
00:02:59,261 --> 00:03:00,460
parcel of agreeableness.

82
00:03:00,461 --> 00:03:05,461
And so we don't really have any idea how
to integrate male and female dominant

83
00:03:05,651 --> 00:03:06,350
tower Gleason.

84
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:06,580
Thanks.

85
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:07,413
Exactly.

86
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:08,253
That's exactly right.

87
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:09,820
This is why I love this show.

88
00:03:09,821 --> 00:03:11,020
And we real housewives.

89
00:03:11,021 --> 00:03:11,410
And I went to,

90
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:14,740
which is the fourth item scorings
and just said just last night,

91
00:03:14,741 --> 00:03:14,930
okay.

92
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:16,620
I was watching one episode all right.

93
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:18,340
Where the women were at each other.

94
00:03:18,341 --> 00:03:18,551
Okay.

95
00:03:18,551 --> 00:03:19,480
At a party and in,

96
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:20,550
in recounting.

97
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:21,870
But I said this to you and,

98
00:03:21,871 --> 00:03:22,671
but you said this to me.

99
00:03:22,671 --> 00:03:23,110
And he was like,

100
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:24,390
and the men I got,

101
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,690
we got together there and said,

102
00:03:25,691 --> 00:03:25,871
well,

103
00:03:25,871 --> 00:03:27,850
this is the way they
communicate with each other.

104
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:28,790
And antisense ended up,

105
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:29,020
you know,

106
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:29,853
men,

107
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:30,581
we men,

108
00:03:30,581 --> 00:03:31,060
okay,

109
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:31,301
just,

110
00:03:31,301 --> 00:03:33,070
we'll have a fist fight and wheel him in.

111
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:35,890
10 minutes later we're going to have a
beer at the bar where they sat next to

112
00:03:35,891 --> 00:03:36,520
each other and so on.

113
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,590
And I have observed that mine to mine,

114
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:39,810
my daughter,

115
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:43,380
my daughter used to be really
irritated about that because she,

116
00:03:43,381 --> 00:03:43,890
she,

117
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:45,180
like most people,

118
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,273
uh,

119
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:48,300
was the target of feminine.

120
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:48,900
Uh,

121
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:51,930
conspiratorial bullying at
one is she's no pushover,

122
00:03:51,931 --> 00:03:52,381
my daughter.

123
00:03:52,381 --> 00:03:55,590
So this wasn't like this was a continual
thing or that she didn't know what to

124
00:03:55,591 --> 00:03:56,131
do about it,

125
00:03:56,131 --> 00:04:01,070
but she had to observe these
girls conspiring against
her and then blackening or

126
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:01,681
name on,

127
00:04:01,681 --> 00:04:02,550
on Facebook,

128
00:04:02,551 --> 00:04:03,390
which is part of it,

129
00:04:03,391 --> 00:04:06,780
part and parcel of the typical
female bullying routine,

130
00:04:06,781 --> 00:04:08,760
which is often reputation demolition,

131
00:04:08,761 --> 00:04:09,001
right.

132
00:04:09,001 --> 00:04:10,380
That there's a good literature on that.

133
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:15,420
And then she'd watched what would happen
if my brother or my son would have a

134
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:16,950
dispute with his friends,

135
00:04:16,951 --> 00:04:17,281
you know,

136
00:04:17,281 --> 00:04:19,650
and maybe they were drinking and there
was a dispute they'd have a fight and

137
00:04:19,651 --> 00:04:21,050
then the next day they were friends again.

138
00:04:21,051 --> 00:04:25,500
And that's another thing that's strange
is that like men have a way of bringing

139
00:04:25,501 --> 00:04:28,230
a conflict to a head
and resolving it right.

140
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:31,440
And that it isn't obvious to
me that women have that same,

141
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,600
perhaps you might call it a luxury,

142
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:36,690
but it's also the case that men don't
know what to do when they get into a

143
00:04:36,691 --> 00:04:39,450
conflict with a woman because what
the hell are you supposed to do?

144
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,050
You know,

145
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:42,240
mostly what you're
supposed to do is avoid it.

146
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:44,050
Well,

147
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:44,880
I think,

148
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:45,300
um,

149
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:45,830
you know,

150
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:48,120
I don't know whether this
crosses into other countries,

151
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:52,020
but that there was a certain kind of
taunting and teasing that men and boys do

152
00:04:52,021 --> 00:04:53,670
with each other that toughens them.

153
00:04:53,671 --> 00:04:53,941
Okay.

154
00:04:53,941 --> 00:04:54,061
And,

155
00:04:54,061 --> 00:04:54,720
and where they don't,

156
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:55,860
they don't take things seriously,

157
00:04:55,861 --> 00:04:59,490
but a girl's feelings become extremely
hurt to have to hear something like that.

158
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:00,570
It was very tough,

159
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:00,781
you know,

160
00:05:00,781 --> 00:05:01,080
again,

161
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,760
like sarcastic against her.

162
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:03,480
So I,

163
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:07,620
I do feel that there are
profound differences between
the sexes in terms of your

164
00:05:07,621 --> 00:05:08,280
emotions,

165
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:09,870
in terms of communication patterns.

166
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:13,260
I know my father used to say that
he could never follow women's can

167
00:05:13,261 --> 00:05:13,981
conversations.

168
00:05:13,981 --> 00:05:14,221
He said,

169
00:05:14,221 --> 00:05:14,580
here's the deal.

170
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:14,821
He said,

171
00:05:14,821 --> 00:05:16,950
women don't even finish
the finish sentences there.

172
00:05:16,951 --> 00:05:20,160
Then with the women understand immediately
what the other woman is saying.

173
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:20,940
Okay.

174
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:21,240
Uh,

175
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,073
and um,

176
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:22,290
the,

177
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:25,950
in the way the women tend to be more
interested in or have been traditionally

178
00:05:25,951 --> 00:05:27,150
more interested in soap operas,

179
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:30,600
it's not just the women who were
home without jobs is that I honestly,

180
00:05:30,601 --> 00:05:33,120
I believe that soap opera does reflect,

181
00:05:33,121 --> 00:05:35,400
does mirror the way
women talk to each other.

182
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:35,641
Those are,

183
00:05:35,641 --> 00:05:39,210
these communication patterns have been
built up through women in the world of

184
00:05:39,211 --> 00:05:39,630
women.

185
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:39,811
Okay.

186
00:05:39,811 --> 00:05:39,991
Which,

187
00:05:39,991 --> 00:05:41,460
which was it made sense?

188
00:05:41,461 --> 00:05:42,750
There was a division of labor.

189
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:43,320
Okay.

190
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:46,200
It wasn't sexism against women
that there was a division of labor.

191
00:05:46,201 --> 00:05:48,420
The men went off to hunt and
did the dangerous things.

192
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:51,000
The women stayed around the hearth
because you had pregnant women,

193
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:51,983
nursing women,

194
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:54,420
older women were cooking and so on.

195
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:57,440
So I feel that these
communication patterns that
we're talking about have been

196
00:05:57,441 --> 00:06:01,880
built up over the centuries and
the men had to toughen each other.

197
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:01,991
Okay.

198
00:06:01,991 --> 00:06:03,060
It took a while to go out and you know,

199
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,790
the hunting parties and native Americans,

200
00:06:04,791 --> 00:06:04,971
you know,

201
00:06:04,971 --> 00:06:05,380
it would be,

202
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:07,120
they could be gone for two weeks and when,

203
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:09,950
when the temperature was below
zero and in many of them die.

204
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:10,710
Yeah.

205
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:11,810
The idea that somehow,

206
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:12,740
oh,

207
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:16,640
any kind of separation of the sexes
or different spheres of the sexes is

208
00:06:16,641 --> 00:06:17,990
inherently sexist.

209
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:18,833
And

210
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:22,280
the answer to all of this,

211
00:06:22,281 --> 00:06:22,481
okay.

212
00:06:22,481 --> 00:06:24,350
That everything that we're talking about,

213
00:06:24,351 --> 00:06:24,710
okay.

214
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:27,860
Is Education into early history.

215
00:06:27,861 --> 00:06:28,360
Okay.

216
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,091
And until you are,

217
00:06:29,091 --> 00:06:30,980
until people understand the stone age,

218
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:32,030
but nomadic period,

219
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:35,360
the agrarian era and how culture,

220
00:06:35,361 --> 00:06:36,950
how civilization built up.

221
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:37,191
Okay.

222
00:06:37,191 --> 00:06:38,210
In Mesopotamia,

223
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:39,860
the great irrigation projects,

224
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,470
or in or in Egypt where you had,

225
00:06:42,471 --> 00:06:45,800
for the first centralized government
authority became necessary.

226
00:06:45,801 --> 00:06:46,340
Okay.

227
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:47,470
To master these,

228
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:47,821
these,

229
00:06:47,821 --> 00:06:48,060
um,

230
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:48,401
you know,

231
00:06:48,401 --> 00:06:51,110
we had a situation where
at an environmentally,

232
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:51,571
uh,

233
00:06:51,571 --> 00:06:51,940
you know,

234
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:52,390
uh,

235
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:52,790
you know,

236
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:55,730
difficult situation like the
deserts of Mesopotamia or,

237
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:56,400
or the,

238
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,350
the peculiar character of,

239
00:06:58,351 --> 00:07:00,860
of Egyptian geography where you
can only have a little tiny,

240
00:07:00,890 --> 00:07:01,191
tiny,

241
00:07:01,191 --> 00:07:03,730
fertile line along the edges of the Nile.

242
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:03,951
Okay.

243
00:07:03,951 --> 00:07:05,660
And not otherwise it desert landscape.

244
00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:08,750
So th this civilization and a 14.

245
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:09,430
Okay.

246
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:09,920
All right.

247
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:12,620
I ask not necessarily
about power grabbing,

248
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:17,650
but about organization to achieve
something for the good of the people as a

249
00:07:17,901 --> 00:07:18,140
whole.
