Hi,

2
00:00:00,731 --> 00:00:01,564
Dr. Peterson,

3
00:00:02,260 --> 00:00:06,010
I'm a 17 year old girl and up tool gets
turned to rare for someone like me who

4
00:00:06,011 --> 00:00:06,844
listened to,

5
00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:08,560
well,

6
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:09,310
maybe it is,

7
00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:10,600
but I don't think it is.

8
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:11,960
So you know,

9
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:15,460
there's this idea that the only people
who are listening to me or angry white

10
00:00:15,461 --> 00:00:16,294
men,

11
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:18,693
he's a maker.

12
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:20,450
He might get in this whole idea

13
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:29,750
and brown women in the audience too.

14
00:00:32,620 --> 00:00:33,790
As far as I'm concerned.

15
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:35,780
This is just so absurd as that.

16
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:39,310
I can't believe that this has
even become controversial,

17
00:00:39,311 --> 00:00:41,050
is talking to people about,

18
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:41,770
you know,

19
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:45,650
taking responsibility for the
state of the world onto themselves,

20
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,850
the radical leftist identity politics.

21
00:00:48,851 --> 00:00:53,080
City logs can only view this through the
lens of their radical leftist identity

22
00:00:53,081 --> 00:00:53,741
politics.

23
00:00:53,741 --> 00:00:57,160
And instead of noticing that
this isn't a political issue,

24
00:00:57,790 --> 00:01:01,290
except that I don't like the radical
leftists and the restrictions on free

25
00:01:01,291 --> 00:01:06,291
speech [inaudible] for me,

26
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:14,990
it's the politics junkie.

27
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:16,900
It's found founders,

28
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:22,650
the politicians started to do the things
that they don't get to do is staring

29
00:01:22,651 --> 00:01:27,150
into philosophical realm or they stepped
into the theological rep and they

30
00:01:27,151 --> 00:01:29,020
should stay the hell out of both

31
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:36,513
the individual.

32
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:37,460
You're,

33
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:39,450
you're no longer where you should.

34
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:43,280
You've transformed yourself into
a tire and not the good time,

35
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:44,950
not that there is a good conductor.

36
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:49,190
So now the consequences of God,

37
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:50,153
Carlos,

38
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:56,230
because our would be objected to that
vociferously and with a fair degree of

39
00:01:56,521 --> 00:01:57,354
success,

40
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:03,960
the only responsible can be mounted is
the response that exists within that

41
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:07,020
domain of conceptualization
of identity politics.

42
00:02:07,021 --> 00:02:08,970
And so since I'm objecting to that,

43
00:02:08,971 --> 00:02:13,260
then I must be the reprehensible
editing slept well,

44
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:14,640
good luck with that story.

45
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:17,640
It's not going to work out
because that is what's going on.

46
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:20,640
So and so to the 17 year old girl,

47
00:02:20,641 --> 00:02:24,690
it's like who knows how many 17 year old
girls are paying attention to what I'm

48
00:02:24,691 --> 00:02:24,990
saying?

49
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:25,823
I need to,

50
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,490
I would say it's in the tens of thousands
and perhaps hundreds of thousands.

51
00:02:29,491 --> 00:02:31,950
And so the mere fact that
that isn't the story,

52
00:02:31,951 --> 00:02:36,951
that a small subsection of the ideological
he committed partner media is telling

53
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:42,310
you by no means all of them by any stretch
of the imagination doesn't mean it's

54
00:02:42,311 --> 00:02:43,490
cannot be true.

55
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:48,860
So now when might be rare statistically
speaking for 17 year olds to be

56
00:02:48,961 --> 00:02:49,660
listening to me,

57
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:51,240
but her plenty of them that are,

58
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:52,950
I get letters from them all the time.

59
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:55,200
More power to them as
far as I'm concerned.

60
00:02:55,201 --> 00:02:59,920
It's a complicated message that lectures
are very sophisticated and difficult.

61
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:01,830
It's great if,

62
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:04,990
if you happen to find that your
interest is captured by them,

63
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:06,520
then there's something to that.

64
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:08,620
What advice would I give for teens?

65
00:03:08,621 --> 00:03:11,110
Like you do what you think's right,

66
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:11,973
Kiddo.

67
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:17,300
[inaudible].
