1
00:00:06,790 --> 00:00:07,090
You know,

2
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:09,580
from a strictly scientific perspective,

3
00:00:09,581 --> 00:00:12,970
we think of human beings has nothing
but the children of nature and culture.

4
00:00:12,971 --> 00:00:16,750
And that pushes you towards
a kind of deterministic view.

5
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:17,950
What causes your behavior?

6
00:00:17,951 --> 00:00:18,071
Well,

7
00:00:18,071 --> 00:00:20,620
it's either nature or culture
because there isn't anything else.

8
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:24,400
But that isn't how the mythological story
lays itself out because it says there

9
00:00:24,401 --> 00:00:27,310
is something else and that's
whatever your consciousness is.

10
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:32,020
And that consciousness seems to be able
to work with nature and culture in a non

11
00:00:32,021 --> 00:00:37,021
deterministic manner in order
to bring well in order for what?

12
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:41,980
In order to bring itself forward.

13
00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:42,251
I mean,

14
00:00:42,251 --> 00:00:46,300
and that's really what's interesting
about that I think is that it isn't

15
00:00:46,330 --> 00:00:48,250
obviously just the plot of Pinocchio,

16
00:00:48,251 --> 00:00:51,880
it's virtually the plot of any story
is the story of the development of the

17
00:00:51,881 --> 00:00:52,510
individual.

18
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:56,650
Now the story is order chaos,

19
00:00:57,340 --> 00:00:58,150
higher order,

20
00:00:58,150 --> 00:00:59,050
roughly speaking.

21
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,610
So you can get variants of that.

22
00:01:00,610 --> 00:01:05,610
You can get order collapses into
disorder and nothing is resolved.

23
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:07,000
That's a tragedy,

24
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:08,013
right?

25
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:08,800
And,

26
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,580
and you can get so,

27
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:14,590
so you don't have to have the entire
story represented in his story,

28
00:01:14,591 --> 00:01:15,700
but you get fragments of it.

29
00:01:15,701 --> 00:01:16,570
It's a classic.

30
00:01:16,571 --> 00:01:19,900
You shaped story and what it is is
the story of the development of the

31
00:01:19,901 --> 00:01:24,040
individual across time as a consequence
of his or her adventures in time and

32
00:01:24,041 --> 00:01:24,551
space.

33
00:01:24,551 --> 00:01:27,760
And every story is exactly that.

34
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:33,150
And those are representations
of the manner in which you
come to be in the world

35
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:35,260
for better or for worse.

36
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:36,490
It's differentiated.

37
00:01:36,491 --> 00:01:38,420
So the individual has
a negative and a pause.

38
00:01:38,421 --> 00:01:40,870
Development and culture
has a negative and a pause.

39
00:01:40,871 --> 00:01:42,790
Development and nature does as well,

40
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:46,810
and that makes the potential
for plots much broader.

41
00:01:47,410 --> 00:01:52,060
But I think it's also very useful to know
that entire story because I think it's

42
00:01:52,061 --> 00:01:54,220
one of the things that
protects you against ideology.

43
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:54,671
It's like,

44
00:01:54,671 --> 00:01:55,001
okay.

45
00:01:55,001 --> 00:01:59,260
Whereas if someone tells you a
political story or a story of any sort,

46
00:01:59,261 --> 00:02:00,041
you can always ask,

47
00:02:00,041 --> 00:02:00,221
well,

48
00:02:00,221 --> 00:02:01,510
where are the missing characters?

49
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:02,980
Human beings are terrible.

50
00:02:02,981 --> 00:02:06,950
They've erected a culture
that's destroying the planet
and nature is beneath,

51
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:07,630
you know,

52
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:09,520
benevolent and and pristine.

53
00:02:09,521 --> 00:02:09,851
It's like,

54
00:02:09,851 --> 00:02:10,061
yeah,

55
00:02:10,061 --> 00:02:10,780
fair enough.

56
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:11,291
Accurate.

57
00:02:11,291 --> 00:02:15,580
But you're missing half the characters
because humans are not just terrible

58
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:16,660
rapacious creatures.

59
00:02:16,661 --> 00:02:19,510
And culture is not just a
destructive force in nature,

60
00:02:19,511 --> 00:02:21,370
is by no means on our side.

61
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:24,190
So where's the missing characters?

62
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:27,580
You need all of the characters in
the representation to get it right.

63
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:29,680
And I really believe this to be true.

64
00:02:29,681 --> 00:02:30,610
So for example,

65
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:35,080
if you want to protect yourself against
trauma as you move forward in life,

66
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:37,330
you have to be very aware of the three,

67
00:02:37,331 --> 00:02:38,740
three negative characters.

68
00:02:38,741 --> 00:02:42,580
You have to know that the human individual
has an adversarial element that's

69
00:02:42,581 --> 00:02:44,140
malevolent right to the core.

70
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:47,590
And if you don't know that and you
run across someone who's malevolent,

71
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:49,630
you will end up damaged.

72
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:52,390
So because first you won't
be able to defend yourself.

73
00:02:52,391 --> 00:02:55,690
You'll just be like a ripe fruit
tree for the plucking and second,

74
00:02:55,691 --> 00:03:00,100
the mere existence of someone like that
will pose such a to the way that you've

75
00:03:00,101 --> 00:03:01,030
organized the world,

76
00:03:01,031 --> 00:03:02,350
that it might collapse on you.

77
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:04,300
That happens to people all the time.

78
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:07,900
So it really matters whether you know
these categories and it matters that you

79
00:03:07,901 --> 00:03:09,850
know that culture can become tyrannical.

80
00:03:09,851 --> 00:03:10,270
It really,

81
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:13,030
but that it's also you're the
father that's given you everything.

82
00:03:13,031 --> 00:03:14,770
And it matters that you know,

83
00:03:14,771 --> 00:03:17,860
everything good comes from nature and
that we need to live in harmony with

84
00:03:17,861 --> 00:03:18,760
nature to some degree.

85
00:03:18,761 --> 00:03:22,660
But that it's also a hell bent
on our destruction every second.

86
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,700
And it's very paradoxical.

87
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:25,061
It's a,

88
00:03:25,061 --> 00:03:26,980
it's a hard thing to reconcile with,

89
00:03:26,981 --> 00:03:27,310
with,

90
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:28,143
with uh,

91
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:32,260
without a thought structure like modern
science that's based on a strict logic

92
00:03:32,261 --> 00:03:35,980
that always says something can't be
itself and its opposite at the same time.

93
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:36,701
But you know,

94
00:03:36,701 --> 00:03:41,701
human beings can certainly be something
and its opposite at the same time and

95
00:03:41,801 --> 00:03:45,640
anything truly complex can have
that and does have that nature.

96
00:03:45,641 --> 00:03:47,200
If someone offers you a new job,

97
00:03:47,201 --> 00:03:47,561
you think,

98
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:48,640
well that's positive.

99
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:49,870
It's like no it's not.

100
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:53,170
It's positive and negative and complex.

101
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:56,830
It might be the solution to your problem
but at the same set time it's going to

102
00:03:56,831 --> 00:03:58,750
generate a whole host of other problems.

103
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:00,730
So lots of times we're,

104
00:04:00,731 --> 00:04:01,180
we're,

105
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:06,010
we're encountering entities in some
sense that have an internally paradoxical

106
00:04:06,011 --> 00:04:09,240
structure and we have to deal with
that entire set of paradoxes or,

107
00:04:09,241 --> 00:04:10,510
or we don't survive.

108
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:12,340
It's really a matter of survival.

109
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:13,241
Okay.

110
00:04:13,241 --> 00:04:14,074
So,

111
00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:15,243
so I'm,

112
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:16,420
and then you know,

113
00:04:16,421 --> 00:04:17,950
there's this overarching symbol,

114
00:04:17,951 --> 00:04:19,330
which is the dragon of chaos,

115
00:04:19,331 --> 00:04:20,740
which is potential itself.

116
00:04:20,741 --> 00:04:23,620
And it's the potential from which
all of these categories emerge.

117
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:25,540
And so the,

118
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:26,740
the,

119
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:30,790
the most abstract category
of our imagination is that,

120
00:04:30,791 --> 00:04:34,030
which is beyond our understanding the
category of that which is beyond our

121
00:04:34,031 --> 00:04:34,864
understanding.

122
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:39,250
And that seems to me to be represented
because we can only use the

123
00:04:39,251 --> 00:04:41,440
representational
structures that we evolved,

124
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:46,770
is that it's represented in
our paradoxical representation
of the Predator and

125
00:04:47,501 --> 00:04:49,930
the treasure that lies
beyond the perimeter,

126
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:53,800
that perimeter perimeters
of our safe societies.

127
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:55,840
So what's out there beyond,

128
00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:56,261
well,

129
00:04:56,261 --> 00:04:57,040
we don't know,

130
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,310
but we need to know because we need
always to deal with what we don't know.

131
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:01,390
So weirdly enough,

132
00:05:01,391 --> 00:05:04,660
we have to come up with a category of
what we don't know in order to start

133
00:05:04,661 --> 00:05:09,661
formalizing a theory about how we might
progress towards it and interact with

134
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:10,210
it.

135
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:13,960
It's very paradoxical idea and
there's a paradoxical answer,

136
00:05:13,961 --> 00:05:14,171
right?

137
00:05:14,171 --> 00:05:14,351
It's,

138
00:05:14,351 --> 00:05:18,220
it's the terrible Predator that lurks in
the unknown that also harbors something

139
00:05:18,221 --> 00:05:19,054
of great value.

140
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:20,343
Perfect.

141
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:21,071
Perfect.

142
00:05:21,071 --> 00:05:21,970
That's exactly right.

143
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:22,990
That's exactly right.

144
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:27,550
And I think that that is a reflection of
the fact that human beings are Predator

145
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:30,040
animals and prey animals at the same time.

146
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:31,450
So what's out there in the,

147
00:05:31,451 --> 00:05:33,310
in the terrible darkness,

148
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:37,360
something that can destroy you but also
something that you absolutely need.

149
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:38,590
So how do you,

150
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:41,380
how do you prepare yourself for that?

151
00:05:41,381 --> 00:05:43,030
And that's the ultimate question of life.

152
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:44,920
It's not how do you deal with death,

153
00:05:44,921 --> 00:05:47,590
although death is a sub component
of the terrible unknown,

154
00:05:47,591 --> 00:05:51,190
I would say it's how do you deal with
that which is beyond your understanding,

155
00:05:51,191 --> 00:05:54,010
which is constantly manifesting
itself in the world.

156
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:54,821
And that,

157
00:05:54,821 --> 00:05:58,730
and that manifests itself every time
you categorize something and the thing

158
00:05:58,731 --> 00:05:59,900
escapes from the category.

159
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:03,980
And that happens most interpersonal
relationships because people are so damn

160
00:06:03,981 --> 00:06:04,670
complicated,

161
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:06,350
you get them figured out and box in.

162
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:08,660
You even make a contract
that neither review,

163
00:06:08,661 --> 00:06:10,280
we'll jump outside the box,

164
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:12,740
but you jump outside the box continually.

165
00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:16,190
And that's why a relationship
requires constant negotiation and

166
00:06:16,191 --> 00:06:20,990
reconceptualization because you do not
exhaust the person with your perceptual

167
00:06:20,991 --> 00:06:21,824
categories.

168
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:26,000
And of course you don't exhaust the world
with your perceptual categories ever.

169
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:28,340
This is partly why the existentialists,

170
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:31,100
they have this concept called alienation.

171
00:06:31,101 --> 00:06:34,160
And the idea was that human beings
become alienated from their creative

172
00:06:34,161 --> 00:06:34,994
products.

173
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:35,631
So,

174
00:06:35,631 --> 00:06:36,770
and that is,

175
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:37,850
and here's why it happens.

176
00:06:37,851 --> 00:06:42,080
So imagine a Henry Ford
makes the assembly line,

177
00:06:42,081 --> 00:06:42,291
right?

178
00:06:42,291 --> 00:06:42,721
So four,

179
00:06:42,721 --> 00:06:45,710
it has no idea what's going to happen
when he makes the assembly line.

180
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:46,250
Like,

181
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:49,490
cause he's just trying to figure out a
fast way to make cars or he thinks that

182
00:06:49,491 --> 00:06:50,570
what he's making his cars.

183
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:54,380
So he thinks he's making an assembly
line for cars and he thinks he's making

184
00:06:54,381 --> 00:06:55,214
cars.

185
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:56,061
And you think,

186
00:06:56,061 --> 00:06:57,230
well what's wrong with that?

187
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:58,041
Well first of all,

188
00:06:58,041 --> 00:07:01,340
the assembly line absolutely
transformed the entire planet,

189
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:02,180
right?

190
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:03,013
Because it,

191
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:06,530
it brought in the era of
mass cheap manufacturing.

192
00:07:06,531 --> 00:07:07,364
It's like it just,

193
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:10,280
it was way more than he thought it was.

194
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:12,950
And then did he make a car?

195
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:13,371
Well,

196
00:07:13,371 --> 00:07:17,030
a car is something that hypothetically
takes you relatively effectively from

197
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:18,380
point a to point B.

198
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:20,960
It was really a replacement
for the horse and buggy.

199
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:22,010
I mean they,

200
00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:24,650
the first cars looked like that
they were horseless carriages.

201
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:25,520
Well,

202
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,230
did he make a car while God,

203
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:27,801
it's God,

204
00:07:27,801 --> 00:07:29,690
it's hard to tell what Henry Ford made.

205
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:33,080
He made a very effective way
for transforming the atmosphere.

206
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:34,281
Right.

207
00:07:34,281 --> 00:07:37,250
And the fact that it also happened to
take you from point a to point B might be

208
00:07:37,251 --> 00:07:41,240
just completely irrelevant compared
to the fact that it was the internal

209
00:07:41,241 --> 00:07:45,680
combustion engine and its
rapid distribution completely
changed the constituent,

210
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:45,970
the,

211
00:07:45,970 --> 00:07:46,311
you know,

212
00:07:46,311 --> 00:07:46,700
the,

213
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:50,210
the fundamental chemical structure
of the atmosphere itself.

214
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:52,370
It completely transformed cities.

215
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:54,470
It blew out the rural community.

216
00:07:54,471 --> 00:07:55,730
Everyone moved to the cities,

217
00:07:55,731 --> 00:07:56,270
right?

218
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:59,360
It made all the cities
built around the automobile.

219
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:03,170
But then it had this tremendous
political and economic significance too.

220
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:03,981
So I mean,

221
00:08:03,981 --> 00:08:08,780
part of the reason that because you
think well is a car is a way to get from

222
00:08:08,781 --> 00:08:09,680
point a to point B.

223
00:08:09,681 --> 00:08:10,091
But no,

224
00:08:10,091 --> 00:08:10,371
no,

225
00:08:10,371 --> 00:08:11,360
it's not a machine.

226
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,760
It's also the abolishment of an idea.

227
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:15,320
And it's a very strange idea.

228
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:19,640
A collectivist society would have never
invented the car because the car is

229
00:08:19,641 --> 00:08:24,641
predicated on the idea that you could
own a conveyance that would get only you

230
00:08:24,651 --> 00:08:28,460
and only you from somewhere to somewhere
else without ever asking anybody for

231
00:08:28,461 --> 00:08:29,720
any permission.

232
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:33,290
And so the funny thing is is when
you build something like that,

233
00:08:33,291 --> 00:08:35,150
those presuppositions are built into it.

234
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:38,630
And then when you export
that say to Soviet Russia,

235
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:39,650
you don't get to,

236
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:44,300
they can't just take the car and leave
the political implications behind the

237
00:08:44,301 --> 00:08:44,721
car.

238
00:08:44,721 --> 00:08:49,340
The mere fact that you step into one and
drive it is an indication that you're

239
00:08:49,341 --> 00:08:50,960
accepting the political,

240
00:08:50,961 --> 00:08:55,961
ideological presuppositions that are
part of the fact that thing even exists.

241
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:58,470
And so well that's alienation.

242
00:08:58,471 --> 00:09:01,290
It's like even something you make,

243
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:01,621
you think,

244
00:09:01,621 --> 00:09:04,920
well you have control over what
you make because you've made it,

245
00:09:04,921 --> 00:09:05,820
you understand.

246
00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:06,720
It's like no you don't.

247
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,670
You understand a tiny fraction of it.

248
00:09:08,671 --> 00:09:09,630
You launch it out in the world,

249
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:09,841
man,

250
00:09:09,841 --> 00:09:11,610
and the snakes inside of it,

251
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:15,600
the hydrogen high inside of it
multiplied their heads massively,

252
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:19,110
constantly and you and you and
you can't really keep track of it.

253
00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:20,483
And so,

254
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:24,390
so even even in your relationship
with created entities,

255
00:09:24,391 --> 00:09:28,530
you still see the reemergence of this
underlying fundamental substructure,

256
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:29,220
right?

257
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:30,120
Even inside,

258
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:30,601
it's the,

259
00:09:30,601 --> 00:09:31,650
it's the garden of Eden.

260
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,180
There's always a snake inside.

261
00:09:33,181 --> 00:09:34,980
The thing that's walled in always,

262
00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:35,461
always,

263
00:09:35,461 --> 00:09:35,880
always.

264
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:39,030
Even God himself cannot get rid
of the snakes in the garden.

265
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:40,950
And partly what that means is that,

266
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:41,640
you know,

267
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,500
the garden is a conceptual system.

268
00:09:43,501 --> 00:09:46,440
It's the conceptual system
within which people exist.

269
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,580
That's Eden is a,

270
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:48,900
is a walled garden.

271
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:50,790
Paradise means walled garden,

272
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:53,970
and it's walled because a walled
garden is where people live.

273
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:56,390
Because the wall is culture
and the garden is natured.

274
00:09:56,400 --> 00:10:00,240
We always live in a structure that's
an amalgam of nature and culture.

275
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:04,080
So we set it up so it's paradise
as long as we're unconscious,

276
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:07,530
but we can't manage it because there's
always something chaotic that's coming in

277
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,030
that we will interact with.

278
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:10,290
That's human beings.

279
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:11,610
You put a snake in the garden.

280
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:13,290
It's the first bloody thing
we're going to talk to.

281
00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:14,730
And for better or worse,

282
00:10:14,731 --> 00:10:16,770
it makes us conscious and awake.

283
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:18,720
It makes us aware of our mortality.

284
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:20,940
It does all sorts of
terrible things to us,

285
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,800
but that doesn't matter because that's,

286
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:25,020
that's the path that human beings have.

287
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,040
What chosen,

288
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:28,680
because that's the
implication in that story.

289
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:29,190
And,

290
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:29,591
and it's,

291
00:10:29,591 --> 00:10:30,660
it's very difficult.

292
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:35,750
It's a very difficult thing to answer
because we certainly choose each other for

293
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:39,030
self awareness and
consciousness and intelligence.

294
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:39,991
And I don't,

295
00:10:39,991 --> 00:10:40,261
you know,

296
00:10:40,261 --> 00:10:40,591
if you're,

297
00:10:40,591 --> 00:10:41,880
if you're choosing a mate,

298
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:45,090
there's an arms race in human beings.

299
00:10:45,091 --> 00:10:48,840
We're choosing intelligent
mates especially that's
especially the case for women

300
00:10:48,841 --> 00:10:49,920
in relationship to men.

301
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:50,960
So,

302
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:51,793
um,

303
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:53,343
so that,

304
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,900
the idea that that's a choice,

305
00:10:54,901 --> 00:10:57,930
well that's partly why it's eve that
makes that himself conscious in the garden

306
00:10:57,931 --> 00:10:58,291
of Eden,

307
00:10:58,291 --> 00:10:58,471
right?

308
00:10:58,471 --> 00:10:59,640
She offers him the apple.

309
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:01,680
She's the one that makes
him self conscious.

310
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:05,280
And I think that's actually accurate
because the evidence from the evolutionary

311
00:11:05,281 --> 00:11:09,930
biologist is that human sexuals female
sexual selection was one of the driving

312
00:11:09,931 --> 00:11:12,120
factors that differentiated
us from chimpanzees.

313
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,800
It's a major factor.

314
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:16,830
Chimpanzee females are
not selective maters.

315
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:18,300
They go into estrus,

316
00:11:18,301 --> 00:11:19,230
they'll mate with anything.

317
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:24,060
What happens is the dominant males chase
the subordinate males away and so they

318
00:11:24,061 --> 00:11:25,290
end up leaving more offspring.

319
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:28,320
But it's not a consequence of selection
on the part of the females in human

320
00:11:28,321 --> 00:11:28,651
beings.

321
00:11:28,651 --> 00:11:29,790
It's completely different.

322
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:34,380
Concealed ovulation and intense
selection pressure from women on men.

323
00:11:34,530 --> 00:11:37,590
You have twice as many female
ancestors as you have male ancestors,

324
00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:40,830
and people can never have have
a hard time working that out.

325
00:11:40,831 --> 00:11:43,560
Arithmetically but it's
not that problematic.

326
00:11:43,561 --> 00:11:44,550
You just think on average,

327
00:11:44,551 --> 00:11:46,680
every woman had one child,

328
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:48,720
half of men had none,

329
00:11:48,721 --> 00:11:49,890
and the other half had to,

330
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:53,010
and that's approximately correct.

331
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:56,470
You average across the entire
history of human sexuality.

332
00:11:56,890 --> 00:12:00,520
So human males in particular are
subject to a vicious selection,

333
00:12:00,521 --> 00:12:02,230
pressure on the part of females.

334
00:12:02,231 --> 00:12:07,231
And I also think that's partly why nature
is represented symbolically as female

335
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:09,640
among human beings.

336
00:12:09,641 --> 00:12:10,930
Because after all,

337
00:12:10,931 --> 00:12:12,490
nature is what selects.

338
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:16,780
There's no better definition of
nature then that which selects.
