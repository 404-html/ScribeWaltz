1
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:12,340
No on Rio and birthday,
who was an existentialist

2
00:00:12,341 --> 00:00:14,230
psychotherapist,
um,

3
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:18,040
and who was a leader of the
existentialist movement in the 1950s and

4
00:00:18,041 --> 00:00:20,470
also a profound student of
psychoanalysts.

5
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:24,790
Psychoanalysis talked about something he
characterized as a creative illness,

6
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:29,860
which was something that manifested
itself in Freud and in you and in other

7
00:00:29,861 --> 00:00:34,450
people like Viktor Frankl for example,
who went through periods of extreme and

8
00:00:34,451 --> 00:00:37,510
Darwin,
extreme periods of chaotic disruption

9
00:00:37,511 --> 00:00:41,620
has their new theories were manifesting
themselves because the new theories tore

10
00:00:41,621 --> 00:00:45,280
them apart as they were being developed
and they paid a tremendous personal

11
00:00:45,281 --> 00:00:47,620
price for that.
But generally they were able to

12
00:00:47,621 --> 00:00:52,060
reorganize themselves within the context
of the new theory and that made their

13
00:00:52,061 --> 00:00:55,900
stance more powerful and more complete
than it was before he described the

14
00:00:55,901 --> 00:00:58,480
characteristic elements of the creative
illnesses follows.

15
00:00:58,810 --> 00:01:03,190
It succeeds a period of intense
preoccupation with an idea and search

16
00:01:03,191 --> 00:01:06,670
for a certain truth.
It's a polymorphous condition that can

17
00:01:06,671 --> 00:01:08,770
take the SAPE of depression,
neurosis,

18
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:11,950
psychosomatic ailments,
or even psychosis,

19
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:14,560
whatever the symptoms they are felt as
painful,

20
00:01:14,561 --> 00:01:18,550
if not agonizing by the subject with
alternating periods of alleviation and

21
00:01:18,551 --> 00:01:20,560
worsening it's route.
The onus.

22
00:01:20,561 --> 00:01:24,580
The subject never loses the thread of
his dominating preoccupation.

23
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,600
It's often compatible with normal
professional activity and family life.

24
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:30,900
Okay.

25
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:32,910
But even if he keeps to his social
activities,

26
00:01:32,911 --> 00:01:35,070
he's almost entirely absorbed with
himself.

27
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:40,590
He suffers from feelings of isolation,
even when he has a mentor who guides

28
00:01:40,591 --> 00:01:43,800
them through the ordeal,
like the showman apprentice with his

29
00:01:43,801 --> 00:01:46,830
master.
The termination is often rapid and

30
00:01:46,831 --> 00:01:51,000
marked by a phase of exhilaration.
The subject emerges from his ordeal with

31
00:01:51,001 --> 00:01:54,360
a permanent transformation in his
personality and the conviction that he

32
00:01:54,361 --> 00:01:58,620
has discovered a great truth or a new
spiritual world also happened to Piaget.

33
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:04,490
Many of the 19th and 20th century
figures recognized universally is great

34
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:05,580
nature.
Darwin,

35
00:02:05,581 --> 00:02:06,840
Dostoevsky,
Tolstoy,

36
00:02:06,841 --> 00:02:07,710
Freud,
young.

37
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:10,890
We're also additionally characterized by
lengthy periods of profound

38
00:02:10,891 --> 00:02:15,891
psychological unrest and uncertainty.
Here's our dream that my daughter had

39
00:02:15,991 --> 00:02:18,000
when she was three,
and this is quite a cool dream.

40
00:02:18,001 --> 00:02:20,100
I caught it.
I was able to write it down verbatim

41
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,480
because I was writing at the time.

42
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:24,960
So she came in to tell me this dream.
So I typed it out because it's not that

43
00:02:24,961 --> 00:02:27,900
easy to catch a kid's dream.
So here was the situation.

44
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:31,290
So when we brought her brother home from
the hospital,

45
00:02:31,291 --> 00:02:33,790
he is two years younger than her.
We didn't know,

46
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:36,000
you know,
if there's less than a three year gap

47
00:02:36,001 --> 00:02:38,460
between siblings,
there's a high probability of sibling

48
00:02:38,461 --> 00:02:41,640
rivalry because the old siblings still
needs a lot of attention.

49
00:02:41,641 --> 00:02:44,640
But you know when you have a two year
old you think man that's a baby.

50
00:02:44,641 --> 00:02:47,880
But when you bring a newborn baby home,
that two year olds in adult,

51
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:51,420
like there's such a radical difference
between a newborn and a two year old.

52
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:53,180
And so it's hard on the two year old,
right?

53
00:02:53,181 --> 00:02:55,410
Cause they have to grow up right away
and maybe they don't get as much

54
00:02:55,411 --> 00:02:57,630
attention.
So we taught her to,

55
00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:01,600
we taught her to come for a hug when she
needed to by practicing that.

56
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:03,670
And we also prepared her and told her
that,

57
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:05,500
you know,
there was going to be some trouble but

58
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:07,420
she could get some attention from this
new baby.

59
00:03:07,421 --> 00:03:10,030
And that was also her baby.
So she was all prepared for that.

60
00:03:10,031 --> 00:03:14,470
And so she took a lot of care of that
baby and she thought it was her baby and

61
00:03:14,471 --> 00:03:18,040
she liked this baby.
And so she called him baby and then,

62
00:03:18,041 --> 00:03:19,900
you know,
he started to toddle around and,

63
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:22,360
and uh,
and we told her one day,

64
00:03:22,361 --> 00:03:24,050
well,
he was being toilet trained.

65
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:24,970
We said,
look,

66
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:27,490
Mckayla,
he's not really a baby anymore.

67
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:29,440
And she didn't like that because she
thought,

68
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:30,880
hmm,
I like that baby.

69
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:34,540
And now whatever this creature is
apparently is not that baby.

70
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:36,310
And so what am I supposed to do about
that?

71
00:03:36,311 --> 00:03:40,120
And not as a profound question because
there are lots of parents who don't let

72
00:03:40,121 --> 00:03:44,440
their children progress past the stage
of baby because they don't want to lose

73
00:03:44,441 --> 00:03:47,800
the baby.
And so it's like she was onto something

74
00:03:47,801 --> 00:03:49,150
major.
So,

75
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:50,493
um,

76
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:56,020
so this is what she said,
this is your dream.

77
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,420
Julian is the name of her little
brother.

78
00:03:58,421 --> 00:04:02,410
Julian's eyes falled out.
And then he falled into pieces and I

79
00:04:02,411 --> 00:04:02,851
said,
what,

80
00:04:02,851 --> 00:04:04,450
what sort of pieces?
And she said,

81
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:06,220
Julian pieces.
It's like,

82
00:04:06,221 --> 00:04:08,980
yeah.
And then his bones falled out too.

83
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:11,770
Then a whole garden and there was water
in it.

84
00:04:11,771 --> 00:04:14,740
And when he came out he was big and my
wife said,

85
00:04:14,741 --> 00:04:17,230
Julian isn't a baby anymore.
And mckayla said,

86
00:04:17,231 --> 00:04:20,280
no,
he's a big boy and above with legs got

87
00:04:20,281 --> 00:04:24,790
him out cause bugs can swim and the hole
was in the park and the park and it

88
00:04:24,791 --> 00:04:27,340
moved into the backyard and he felt he
falled in it,

89
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:31,140
a tree burned and left the hole.
So that was pretty cool.

90
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,310
That's pretty good.
Grade three,

91
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,480
you know,
three year old kid.

92
00:04:34,481 --> 00:04:36,240
And so the park,
they started,

93
00:04:36,241 --> 00:04:39,310
the place was 42 acres and it was like a
real forest and park.

94
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:41,710
And I used to take the kids there like
at twilight and you know,

95
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:45,520
we creep around in there and it was
pretty scary and exciting for them.

96
00:04:45,521 --> 00:04:47,500
So it was sort of an Ick,
scary and exciting place.

97
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:52,090
It was full of trees and so it was the
unknown outside of our little house.

98
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,970
And so her dream said,
well the unknown had moved into the

99
00:04:54,971 --> 00:04:57,940
backyard in the form of a tree and the
tree burned down.

100
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:00,100
And a tree is often a symbol of the
psyche.

101
00:05:00,101 --> 00:05:03,190
And it left the hall and the hall was
full of water and then the little baby

102
00:05:03,191 --> 00:05:06,100
went into the water,
dissolved and went into the water.

103
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:10,660
And then this weird bug guard them out.
So it was some alive thing,

104
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,940
bug.
It's actually,

105
00:05:12,941 --> 00:05:15,100
it was a bug like Jimminy cricket in
Pinocchio,

106
00:05:15,101 --> 00:05:16,660
You know,
cause that's a bug and it's abundant

107
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:19,300
leads transformation by the way.
So anyways,

108
00:05:19,301 --> 00:05:22,570
the bug got him out and then he was a
big boy and what she was dealing with

109
00:05:22,571 --> 00:05:24,580
was the nature of radical
transformation.

110
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:29,560
How one thing could turn into something
different and then reconstitute itself

111
00:05:29,561 --> 00:05:31,900
as something else.
And she did that on a symbolic level.

112
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,730
So what time is it?

113
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:37,160
Three rats.

114
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:43,050
All right,
well I'll tell you this little story for

115
00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:46,290
one minute.
So I had a five year old nephew and he

116
00:05:46,291 --> 00:05:49,380
was having night terrors,
so we'd wake up at night screaming and

117
00:05:49,381 --> 00:05:51,030
happened a lot.
And uh,

118
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:53,310
there was some trouble in his family at
that point.

119
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:55,500
His parents ended up getting divorced,
but anyways,

120
00:05:55,650 --> 00:05:59,600
he'd wake up screaming and he also was
running around during the day with a

121
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,790
little night hat on and like a plastic
sword.

122
00:06:01,791 --> 00:06:03,260
And so he was like,
Joe night,

123
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:03,870
you know,
and,

124
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:07,070
and then when he went to bed,
he had the little night out by him and

125
00:06:07,071 --> 00:06:09,530
also the sword.
And so one night when I was there,

126
00:06:09,531 --> 00:06:11,630
he had one of these night terrors.
And so I will,

127
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:13,400
I was there that morning and I said,
well,

128
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,800
did you dream anything?
And this is what he said,

129
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:20,480
dwarf like beat creatures who came up to
his knees,

130
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:22,250
had he was out in the field and they
were like,

131
00:06:22,251 --> 00:06:24,890
so these little things about this big,
they had no arms,

132
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:29,420
they just had a big head that was beaky
a beak and they were jumping at him with

133
00:06:29,421 --> 00:06:30,920
the beak and like chomping him.

134
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:35,450
And on the top of their head they,
it was all hairy and greasy and on the

135
00:06:35,451 --> 00:06:37,400
top of their head they had a cross
shaved in it.

136
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:40,130
So it was like everybody shut up at that
breakfast.

137
00:06:40,131 --> 00:06:41,030
I can tell us like,
oh,

138
00:06:41,031 --> 00:06:42,160
that's what's happening.
It's no,

139
00:06:42,161 --> 00:06:45,800
no wonder you're screaming.
And then so he is fighting away with

140
00:06:45,801 --> 00:06:48,860
these things and they're jumping on him.
But the problem was I said,

141
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,680
he said he,
there was a dragon in the background and

142
00:06:51,681 --> 00:06:54,950
what was happening was the dragon was
breathing out fire all the time and the

143
00:06:54,951 --> 00:06:57,930
fire and the smoke,
we're turning into these boring,

144
00:06:58,390 --> 00:07:00,350
you know,
little dwarf bird things that were

145
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:01,700
biting him.
And it's like perfect,

146
00:07:01,701 --> 00:07:03,830
right?
It's such a perfect representation.

147
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:08,360
He can't fight off any one problem cause
it's sort of pointless because there's

148
00:07:08,361 --> 00:07:11,360
something in the background generating
problems like mad.

149
00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:14,300
It's like a hydra cut off one head,
seven more grow.

150
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:17,780
So I said,
what could you do about that?

151
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:19,550
Which is a leading question,
right?

152
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:21,530
Because it implies that he could do
something about that.

153
00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:25,580
So then he said,
I would take my dad and we would go

154
00:07:25,581 --> 00:07:28,400
after the dragon.
I jumped on his head and poke his eyes

155
00:07:28,401 --> 00:07:32,540
out with my sword and then I go down its
belly to where the fire comes out.

156
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:36,170
And I'd carve out a piece of the firebox
and I'd make a shield out of it.

157
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:38,660
And I thought,
yes,

158
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:41,470
that's right.
Yeah.

159
00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:43,640
So,
and one of the things that's very

160
00:07:43,641 --> 00:07:45,350
interesting,
and I know this is hard to believe,

161
00:07:45,351 --> 00:07:48,650
but it's absolutely true.
He did not have any night terrors after

162
00:07:48,651 --> 00:07:52,420
that was extra cool.
And it was the leading question.

163
00:07:52,421 --> 00:07:53,600
It's cause he's like victim,
right?

164
00:07:53,601 --> 00:07:54,530
It's like,
oh my God,

165
00:07:54,890 --> 00:07:57,830
horrible bird headed biting things,
you know,

166
00:07:57,860 --> 00:08:00,200
which is pretty good.
It's like that's what the world's like.

167
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:03,680
And then there's something in the
background generating these things.

168
00:08:03,681 --> 00:08:07,130
What do you do?
You go to the source of the trouble and

169
00:08:07,131 --> 00:08:11,140
you find something that shields yourself
from it in the encounter.

170
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,670
Brilliant.
All right.
