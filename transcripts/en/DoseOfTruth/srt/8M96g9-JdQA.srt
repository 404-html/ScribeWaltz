1
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:09,360
Have you watched Rick and Morty?
No,

2
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:12,480
I haven't.
Many people have told me to watch Rick

3
00:00:12,481 --> 00:00:14,610
and Morty,
although they said it's very dark and

4
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:16,860
well that doesn't bother me so much I
suppose.

5
00:00:16,861 --> 00:00:20,640
Although I'm plenty dark perhaps without
adding too much.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,020
So,
but um,

7
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:24,420
I would like to watch it and I probably
will.

8
00:00:24,421 --> 00:00:27,990
So I would love for you to do come and
do a talk in Montreal.

9
00:00:28,010 --> 00:00:29,520
Well,
you never know what that might happen.

10
00:00:29,521 --> 00:00:31,860
I've been talking to God side of bolt
out a fair bit.

11
00:00:31,861 --> 00:00:35,460
You know,
he's coming to Toronto November 11th so

12
00:00:35,461 --> 00:00:38,760
we can do the talk.
That was shut down by Ryerson back in

13
00:00:38,761 --> 00:00:40,950
August.
So I'm looking forward to that.

14
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:42,353
So

15
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:47,250
what's the best way to stop drinking
alcohol and start doing my best in my

16
00:00:47,251 --> 00:00:49,740
psychology degree,
it's affecting my study,

17
00:00:49,741 --> 00:00:53,040
but I can do very well if I stop.
I'm 26.

18
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:55,860
Well,
Paul,

19
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:02,240
what I would say is I think you should
do the future authoring program and you

20
00:01:02,311 --> 00:01:05,760
should really concentrate.
There's a section in it that helps you

21
00:01:05,761 --> 00:01:10,050
determine what your positive view of
your future would be,

22
00:01:10,051 --> 00:01:14,190
but another section that helps you
determine what would happen in your life

23
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:16,380
if you're negative habits got out of
control.

24
00:01:16,381 --> 00:01:20,730
And one of the things that can really
help you control your alcohol intake is

25
00:01:20,731 --> 00:01:24,150
to really,
really think through what you're giving

26
00:01:24,151 --> 00:01:27,420
up and where you could be in five years
if you don't get it under control.

27
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:32,580
And proclivity to alcoholism can be a
really vicious thing.

28
00:01:32,581 --> 00:01:35,010
You know,
lots of people get dragged down into the

29
00:01:35,011 --> 00:01:40,011
mud by alcohol excess alcohol intake,
especially if they're sensitive to the

30
00:01:40,561 --> 00:01:42,840
opiate response that alcohol can
produce.

31
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:45,600
You can tell that if you,
when you drink,

32
00:01:45,601 --> 00:01:47,050
you know,
you get alert and,

33
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:48,360
and,
and uh,

34
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:51,930
let's say more enthusiastic and
energetic and then you don't want to

35
00:01:51,931 --> 00:01:53,410
stop drinking.
That's uh,

36
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:56,760
that's definitely a bad sign with
regards to developing alcoholism.

37
00:01:56,761 --> 00:02:00,340
So I would say you need to figure out
something that's,

38
00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:04,560
that's more important to you,
that drinking and also think through

39
00:02:04,561 --> 00:02:07,320
very hard.
The negative consequences of continuing

40
00:02:07,321 --> 00:02:07,681
it.
You're,

41
00:02:07,681 --> 00:02:10,350
you're at about the age 26 where you
should stop.

42
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:13,830
I mean guys who are going to stop
generally start slow down pretty,

43
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:16,980
pretty intensely around that age.
Um,

44
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:20,820
you know,
get also treating your psychology,

45
00:02:20,821 --> 00:02:23,490
studying as a full time job can also be
helpful.

46
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:24,540
So,
you know,

47
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:27,600
get up at eight in the morning or seven
30 in the morning and start hitting the

48
00:02:27,601 --> 00:02:30,540
books by nine and put in a six to eight
hour day.

49
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,930
And then even if you do keep drinking,
at least you're moving forward.

50
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:36,300
So that's what I can say about the APP.

51
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:42,150
Are you a science fiction fan?
You referenced timelines,

52
00:02:42,151 --> 00:02:46,020
starship troopers in a lecture,
and your ideas often remind me of Harry

53
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:48,600
Selden's plan from Asimov's foundation
series.

54
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:49,321
Hey,
well,

55
00:02:49,321 --> 00:02:52,410
when I was a kid,
which is quite a long time ago now,

56
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,990
um,
I lived in this town called Fairview,

57
00:02:54,991 --> 00:02:58,140
Alberta,
which was a town of about 3000 people

58
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:03,370
way the hell north 350 miles northwest
of Edmonton.

59
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:07,540
And I have this neighbor across the
street across the Ellie actually,

60
00:03:07,541 --> 00:03:09,580
and he had a huge science fiction
library.

61
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:11,470
It must've been,
I dunno,

62
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:14,590
5,000 books there,
1970s,

63
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:16,750
1960s,
1970s classics,

64
00:03:16,751 --> 00:03:20,470
like Heinlein and Asimov.
And he would let me go over there and

65
00:03:20,471 --> 00:03:24,250
take like 20 books at a time.
And I was reading about a book a day at

66
00:03:24,251 --> 00:03:26,830
that point.
And I read science fiction like mad

67
00:03:26,831 --> 00:03:31,831
probably till I was about 19 or so,
and maybe a little younger than that and

68
00:03:32,351 --> 00:03:34,940
then turn more to classic literature
when I got to college.

69
00:03:34,941 --> 00:03:36,130
And,
and,

70
00:03:36,131 --> 00:03:38,470
uh,
also partly as a consequence of some

71
00:03:38,471 --> 00:03:41,530
lessons that the local library and
taught me about what to read.

72
00:03:41,531 --> 00:03:44,670
So I was a science fiction fan.
Um,

73
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:47,380
I haven't read science fiction for a
very long time,

74
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:49,930
although I was pretty happy with it when
I was a kid.

75
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:50,980
So.
