1
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:11,261
Ethan's,

2
00:00:11,261 --> 00:00:11,811
the Gal says,

3
00:00:11,811 --> 00:00:13,130
how do you boost your confidence?

4
00:00:13,131 --> 00:00:16,550
Talking to people and get
rid of the paranoid that
people hate you and don't say

5
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:18,170
like you and think you're trash.

6
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:19,370
That's how I feel.

7
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:19,851
Okay,

8
00:00:19,851 --> 00:00:21,020
well the first thing is,

9
00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:22,483
um,

10
00:00:26,290 --> 00:00:27,123
okay.

11
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:29,870
Let me tell you a little
bit about courage.

12
00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:30,921
No,

13
00:00:30,921 --> 00:00:32,000
a little bit about trust.

14
00:00:32,001 --> 00:00:32,834
Sorry.

15
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:34,970
When you're a naive person,

16
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:40,130
you trust people because you think that
people are good and then maybe someone

17
00:00:40,131 --> 00:00:41,440
comes along and hurts you and you think,

18
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:41,840
oh no,

19
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:42,531
people aren't good.

20
00:00:42,531 --> 00:00:43,610
I can't trust anyone.

21
00:00:43,611 --> 00:00:44,970
And then maybe you're paranoid.

22
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:49,700
You think that people hate you and don't
like you and think your trash and so

23
00:00:49,701 --> 00:00:50,031
forth.

24
00:00:50,031 --> 00:00:50,990
You don't trust people.

25
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:52,100
But then you figure out,

26
00:00:52,101 --> 00:00:52,551
Jesus,

27
00:00:52,551 --> 00:00:55,790
this whole not trusting people isn't
working out very well because now I can't

28
00:00:55,791 --> 00:00:56,451
get anywhere.

29
00:00:56,451 --> 00:00:56,630
And,

30
00:00:56,630 --> 00:01:00,050
and if I ever do meet someone who's
trustworthy and I don't trust them,

31
00:01:00,051 --> 00:01:02,630
then they're not going to get an
opportunity to show me that they're

32
00:01:02,631 --> 00:01:03,231
trustworthy.

33
00:01:03,231 --> 00:01:08,231
And so then what happens is that you
replace naive trust with courageous trust,

34
00:01:08,481 --> 00:01:12,110
and you put yourself out there despite
the fact that people might hate you and

35
00:01:12,111 --> 00:01:13,940
don't like you and think you're trash.

36
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:15,350
You know?

37
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:16,183
So

38
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,940
the other thing I would
say that's more practical,

39
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:20,720
Ethan,

40
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:24,830
I think you'd find that you only
think that when you run away,

41
00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:28,130
my suspicions are if you went
out and talked to people,

42
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:31,190
like you'd have to have
something to talk about,

43
00:01:31,191 --> 00:01:31,760
you know,

44
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:33,560
but if you went out and talked to people,

45
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:38,930
you'd find that those
thoughts only bothered you for
about 10 to 15 minutes and

46
00:01:38,931 --> 00:01:39,980
then you would get over them.

47
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:40,761
You know,

48
00:01:40,761 --> 00:01:43,730
a lot of that's a high neuroticism.

49
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:44,230
And,

50
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:45,010
and that's,

51
00:01:45,010 --> 00:01:45,440
uh,

52
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:48,320
that in the big five aspect scale,

53
00:01:48,321 --> 00:01:49,490
that's withdrawal.

54
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:53,060
You're experiencing a lot of
withdrawal related negative emotions,

55
00:01:53,061 --> 00:01:54,560
anticipatory anxiety.

56
00:01:54,770 --> 00:01:57,470
And the best way to overcome
that is to not avoid.

57
00:01:57,650 --> 00:02:00,200
So if you find yourself
avoiding social situations,

58
00:02:00,201 --> 00:02:02,900
then you have to formulate
a plan to stop doing that.

59
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,510
And then over time your
confidence will be boosted.
