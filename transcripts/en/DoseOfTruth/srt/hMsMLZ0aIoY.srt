1
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:10,580
One of the things that happens in the
old testament is Israel struggles up to

2
00:00:10,581 --> 00:00:15,260
state and empire status six times
its struggles out of the chaos,

3
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:16,790
up to empire status,

4
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:18,650
and then it gets corrupt.

5
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,230
It loses the way it isn't.

6
00:00:21,231 --> 00:00:25,640
Balancing things between chaos and order
properly that the kings get arrogant.

7
00:00:25,641 --> 00:00:28,700
It's so to the people and they
forget their relationship with God.

8
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:30,290
That's another way of thinking about it.

9
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:31,940
And then a profit comes up and says,

10
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:35,120
you aren't paying enough attention
to the widows and the orphans.

11
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:39,770
You better look out because
that displeases God and the
Israelites who are stiff

12
00:00:39,771 --> 00:00:43,520
necked and arrogant think
what's God going to do to us,

13
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:45,620
which is not a very wise way of thinking.

14
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:50,960
And so they don't take the steps necessary
to rectify their deviation from the

15
00:00:50,961 --> 00:00:51,794
proper path.

16
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:56,600
And they get absolutely flattened
and the consequences of that last for

17
00:00:56,601 --> 00:00:57,500
generations,

18
00:00:57,620 --> 00:00:59,210
like seven generations.

19
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:03,260
And then they struggle their way up to
something approximating empire status

20
00:01:03,261 --> 00:01:04,070
again.

21
00:01:04,070 --> 00:01:05,930
And exactly the same thing happens.

22
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,510
They forget and they collapse.

23
00:01:08,690 --> 00:01:11,240
And there's six stories like
that in the Old Testament.

24
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:14,150
It's all deep documented by
a man named Northrop Frye,

25
00:01:14,151 --> 00:01:18,170
who is a Canadian literary critic who
wrote a couple of books on the Bible,

26
00:01:18,171 --> 00:01:20,840
one called the great code and the
other called words with power,

27
00:01:20,841 --> 00:01:22,400
which I would highly recommend.

28
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,770
It's an analysis of the
Bible as literature.

29
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:25,640
Brilliant.

30
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:28,070
For those of you who might be
interested in union thinking,

31
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:30,770
Fry's thinking is a nice adjunct.

32
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:32,380
So all right,

33
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:33,253
so,

34
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:38,480
so that's the nature of the
world order chaos and order.

35
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:41,570
And your goal is to keep those,

36
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:44,180
the relationship between
those two things optimized.

37
00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:46,490
And you do that by
doing what's meaningful,

38
00:01:46,491 --> 00:01:47,780
not what's expedient.

39
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:53,020
That's rule six and you ensure that you
have the world construed property by

40
00:01:54,290 --> 00:01:55,550
following rule number eight,

41
00:01:55,551 --> 00:01:56,930
which is tell the truth,

42
00:01:56,931 --> 00:01:58,280
or at least don't lie.

43
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:02,570
You don't want to pathologize the instinct
that orients you in the world and you

44
00:02:02,571 --> 00:02:05,870
will pathologize it by
engaging in habitual deceit.

45
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:08,810
And the reason you do that is
when you practice something,

46
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:13,550
you build structures that specialize in
that and then they run automatically.

47
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:15,350
So if you're living a lie,

48
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:17,450
which is a very common
thing for people to do,

49
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:20,780
then you're building
neurological mechanisms that
view the world through that

50
00:02:20,781 --> 00:02:21,380
lie.

51
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:22,430
And once they're built,

52
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:25,580
they're you and good luck unbuilding them.

53
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:26,451
It's very,

54
00:02:26,451 --> 00:02:27,141
very difficult.

55
00:02:27,141 --> 00:02:30,980
That's in part what happens to people
who are addicted by the way they build

56
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:33,140
mechanisms of search,

57
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:38,090
neurological structures that are focused
on the drug and those systems are alive

58
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:40,850
and all they want is the drug and they're,

59
00:02:40,851 --> 00:02:41,421
they're not,

60
00:02:41,421 --> 00:02:42,830
it's not psychological.

61
00:02:42,831 --> 00:02:43,640
Exactly.

62
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:48,640
It's psychophysiological don't build
structures of cognition predicated on

63
00:02:49,191 --> 00:02:51,410
deception because you will pay for it.

64
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:55,610
And so if you're going to guide your
life with the orientation of the instinct

65
00:02:55,611 --> 00:02:56,330
of meaning,

66
00:02:56,330 --> 00:03:00,280
then you have to be very careful with
what you say and write and think.

67
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:03,370
Because every time you say
or write or think something,

68
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:07,210
you build a little neurological structure
that's specialized for that and it

69
00:03:07,211 --> 00:03:09,520
participates in this parsing of the world.

70
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:11,770
So all right,

71
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:19,550
chaos and order.

72
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:21,980
Then you can say the
order orders a hierarchy.

73
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:23,391
Okay,

74
00:03:23,391 --> 00:03:24,620
so here's the next question.

75
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:30,170
Next two questions is order a hierarchy.

76
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:34,250
And then a subsidiary question would be,

77
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:36,200
if order is a hierarchy,

78
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:37,293
what's,

79
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:37,820
well,

80
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:42,110
either what is at the top of the hierarchy
or what should be at the top of the

81
00:03:42,111 --> 00:03:44,090
hierarchy instead of hierarchies,

82
00:03:44,091 --> 00:03:44,990
a structure value.

83
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:49,190
So that's the question is what
should be of all come at value.

84
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:50,720
Okay,

85
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,670
so now we're going to take
that apart a little bit.

86
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:57,020
The first thing I would say
is order is not a hierarchy.

87
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:00,290
Order is a set of hierarchies.

88
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,690
That's a different thing.

89
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,273
So,

90
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:04,830
uh.
