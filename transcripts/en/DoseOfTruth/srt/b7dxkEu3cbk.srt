1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:00,701
Jordan,

2
00:00:00,701 --> 00:00:01,630
great to chat with you today.

3
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:02,311
Hey,

4
00:00:02,311 --> 00:00:03,570
thanks for the invitation.

5
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:04,331
Yeah.

6
00:00:04,331 --> 00:00:05,170
As we were saying,

7
00:00:05,171 --> 00:00:06,460
just before we started,

8
00:00:06,461 --> 00:00:08,350
it's nice to finally
see you and talk to you.

9
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:12,650
We've been in touch for a
while and published a paper
on creativity and I should

10
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:13,840
give you even further context,

11
00:00:13,841 --> 00:00:15,970
which I never gave you when we
were actually collaborating,

12
00:00:15,971 --> 00:00:18,190
which is as I was working
on my dissertation,

13
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:20,540
I drove a lot on your work.

14
00:00:20,541 --> 00:00:23,510
I drew a lot on your work on creativity
and personality and I thought there'd be

15
00:00:23,511 --> 00:00:25,430
no better place than to
start with our discussion.

16
00:00:25,431 --> 00:00:30,431
Then some of that seminal work you have
done on creativity and one concept that

17
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:33,810
really fascinated me in Grad school
was the idea of latent inhibition

18
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:34,943
and

19
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:38,070
you had done some work on that and
had found this really interesting link

20
00:00:38,071 --> 00:00:39,810
between latent inhibition
and the personality trait,

21
00:00:39,811 --> 00:00:40,860
openness to experience,

22
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:42,040
and then you did this,

23
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:45,570
you did that with Shelly Carson and
then you did this work linking it to

24
00:00:45,571 --> 00:00:46,430
creative achievement.

25
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:49,050
So you could talk a little about what
is leading the mission and and how is it

26
00:00:49,051 --> 00:00:49,980
related to creativity?

27
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:51,423
Well,

28
00:00:51,490 --> 00:00:53,080
a lot of what we learn,

29
00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:53,691
you know,

30
00:00:53,691 --> 00:00:55,940
you might think that you
learn what things mean.

31
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:56,360
Okay,

32
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:57,960
and there is some truth in that,

33
00:00:57,961 --> 00:00:59,080
but it's more accurate.

34
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:01,980
Many ways to reverse that,

35
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:05,420
like reversing so many things
in psychology is useful.

36
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:09,600
It's not that useful to try to
figure out why people get addicted,

37
00:01:09,601 --> 00:01:10,261
for example.

38
00:01:10,261 --> 00:01:13,350
It's very useful to figure
out why some people,

39
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:15,800
but most people aren't
addicted all the time.

40
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:19,570
It's not that difficult to
figure out why people are afraid.

41
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:23,110
What's hard is to understand why
people aren't afraid all the time.

42
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:25,050
So a lot of things in psychology,

43
00:01:25,051 --> 00:01:28,260
we get backwards and we tend to think
that we learned the meaning of things,

44
00:01:28,261 --> 00:01:30,850
but that's not exactly true.

45
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:35,790
It's more reasonable to point out that
we learned that things are irrelevant,

46
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:40,950
they start out meaningful and we learned
that there were irrelevant and the

47
00:01:40,951 --> 00:01:44,130
reason for that is that when
you first encountered something,

48
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:48,160
you don't want to assume that it's
irrelevant mostly because it might be

49
00:01:48,161 --> 00:01:48,820
dangerous.

50
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:50,770
Partly also because it might be useful,

51
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:52,700
but most of the things that we encounter,

52
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:57,790
proof neither be dangerous nor useful
and so that we can safely put them aside

53
00:01:58,491 --> 00:02:02,590
with all the other things that we don't
attend to and we don't attend to almost

54
00:02:02,591 --> 00:02:03,424
everything,

55
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:08,490
so learned irrelevance is unbelievably
important and latent inhibition is in

56
00:02:08,491 --> 00:02:12,950
some sense a way of measuring how fast
someone can make something irrelevant

57
00:02:12,951 --> 00:02:13,784
through learning.

58
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:18,880
So imagine that something surprises
you and you have a big response to it,

59
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:21,610
but nothing comes of it and
then the next time it pops up,

60
00:02:21,611 --> 00:02:22,720
it doesn't surprise you at all.

61
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:25,210
That's basically learning
through latent inhibition.

62
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:25,971
Now,

63
00:02:25,971 --> 00:02:28,630
one of the things we
started to contemplate,

64
00:02:28,631 --> 00:02:30,730
this was back 20 years
ago with my student,

65
00:02:30,731 --> 00:02:32,350
Shelly Carson and Daniel Higgins,

66
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:37,170
was the role that artists play
in revivifying perception.

67
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:40,450
So if you look at a van
Gogh painting of viruses,

68
00:02:40,451 --> 00:02:40,991
for example,

69
00:02:40,991 --> 00:02:41,741
or sunflowers,

70
00:02:41,741 --> 00:02:46,741
very famous paintings as if the artist
makes you recall how those remarkable

71
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:52,410
phenomena manifest themselves so that
you can see them as if you're seeing them

72
00:02:52,411 --> 00:02:53,540
again for the first time.

73
00:02:53,541 --> 00:02:57,580
And what we thought was that perhaps
what the artist was doing was stripping

74
00:02:57,581 --> 00:03:01,880
away your latent inhibition so that you
could see things the way you saw them

75
00:03:01,881 --> 00:03:05,930
the first time in all their splendor
and glory before you pack them away

76
00:03:05,931 --> 00:03:07,340
conceptually as irrelevant.

77
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:11,600
And so we tested that with creative
people and found that creative people did

78
00:03:11,601 --> 00:03:14,870
have lower latent inhibition and sorted
people high in the personality trait.

79
00:03:14,871 --> 00:03:15,704
Openness.

80
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:16,420
I love that.

81
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:17,680
I should say that hands.

82
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:19,240
Isaac got there first.

83
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:20,580
Curses soul.

84
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:21,663
It got everywhere.

85
00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:22,963
He did.

86
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:26,050
William James Williams
has got everywhere for us,

87
00:03:26,051 --> 00:03:26,321
but he,

88
00:03:26,321 --> 00:03:27,310
in terms of personality,

89
00:03:27,311 --> 00:03:28,450
I think got their first yet.

90
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:29,361
Well will you?

91
00:03:29,361 --> 00:03:29,811
It's funny,

92
00:03:29,811 --> 00:03:33,930
I guess in some sense William James
even got there before Isaac because he

93
00:03:33,931 --> 00:03:36,000
played around with nitrous oxide,

94
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:36,900
right?

95
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:37,733
So he was one.

96
00:03:37,770 --> 00:03:42,470
He was one of the first experiment
centers with hallucinogens fundamentally.

97
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:47,080
And he wrote hippie
poetry on nitric oxide,

98
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:51,600
noting what was likely something like the
stripping away of latent inhibition as

99
00:03:51,601 --> 00:03:52,434
a consequence of,

100
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,880
of hallucinogenic use.

101
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:55,330
So yeah,

102
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,640
and we're all the eldest Huxley of course,

103
00:03:57,641 --> 00:04:02,641
to believe that hallucinogens
in particular clean the
doors of perception using

104
00:04:02,731 --> 00:04:06,330
William Blake's terminology so that it
was possible to see everything as if you

105
00:04:06,331 --> 00:04:07,950
were seeing it for the first time.

106
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:11,310
There's some forms of brain
damage that can produce that too.

107
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,690
So anyways,

108
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:12,940
yeah,

109
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:13,211
yeah.

110
00:04:13,211 --> 00:04:14,170
So we tested it.

111
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:14,881
Well,

112
00:04:14,881 --> 00:04:18,060
it turned out that latent inhibition
does look like low latent inhibition.

113
00:04:18,061 --> 00:04:21,900
It looks like it's a importantly related
to creativity and to trade openness.

114
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:24,030
Abraham Maslow,

115
00:04:24,031 --> 00:04:27,390
he talked about newness of appreciation
as one of the main characteristics of

116
00:04:27,391 --> 00:04:30,200
self actualizing people and I think
that that can be linked to latent

117
00:04:30,201 --> 00:04:30,620
inhibition.

118
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:31,590
I am sure you would agree.

119
00:04:31,591 --> 00:04:32,760
I bless you just described,

120
00:04:32,761 --> 00:04:33,010
you know,

121
00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:36,090
kind of everything is you
kind of wander to the world.

122
00:04:36,091 --> 00:04:38,190
There's a wonder everything
is kind of fresh again.

123
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:38,561
Yeah.

124
00:04:38,561 --> 00:04:39,910
The cost is likely.

125
00:04:39,911 --> 00:04:41,660
Something like cognitive overload.

126
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:43,150
One of the things does,

127
00:04:43,151 --> 00:04:44,530
Shelly Carson and I,

128
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:49,540
we're trying to investigate
when we studied the hi
openness people at Harvard to

129
00:04:49,541 --> 00:04:50,500
high openness students,

130
00:04:50,501 --> 00:04:51,880
which was very good place to study.

131
00:04:51,881 --> 00:04:52,714
That was that.

132
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:57,750
It looks like in order to handle the
excess sensory input of low latent

133
00:04:58,161 --> 00:04:58,641
inhibition,

134
00:04:58,641 --> 00:05:01,010
it's really useful to have very high,

135
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:02,210
well probably high Iq,

136
00:05:02,211 --> 00:05:04,010
but an high working memory.

137
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:06,200
Those two concepts are quite overlapping,

138
00:05:06,201 --> 00:05:08,140
so it's difficult to
distinguish between them,

139
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:12,530
but it seems probable that if you're
prone to be overwhelmed by sensory

140
00:05:12,531 --> 00:05:17,310
information that you need the cognitive
capacity to handle that and also perhaps

141
00:05:17,311 --> 00:05:18,050
the,

142
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:19,430
and we don't know about this yet,

143
00:05:19,431 --> 00:05:24,100
but the personality ability
to sort through that
critically so you don't end up

144
00:05:24,101 --> 00:05:24,934
overwhelmed.

145
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:28,110
So the shared vulnerability
model of your student,

146
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:30,170
Shelly Carson is very relevant here,

147
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:31,083
right?

148
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:31,790
I don't know.

149
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:32,900
Do you know about.

150
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:36,920
I haven't kept up so well in the last
couple of years with the recent work

151
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:39,160
detailing out the shared
vulnerability models.

152
00:05:39,161 --> 00:05:43,600
Shelly and I wrote a joint series of
articles for the Canadian Journal of

153
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:48,140
Psychiatry on shared vulnerability
between a openness and predisposition to

154
00:05:48,141 --> 00:05:48,974
schizophrenia.

155
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:52,740
I mean that's always lurking in the
background when you talk about creativity,

156
00:05:52,741 --> 00:05:52,981
right?

157
00:05:52,981 --> 00:05:56,480
The share the overlap with manic
depressive disorder and potentially with

158
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:57,323
schizophrenia.

159
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,540
I don't think that's ever
been sorted out properly.

160
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:03,450
I've written a couple of papers in
the past five years on the genetics of

161
00:06:03,451 --> 00:06:05,960
psychosis and it's
overlapped with creativity,

162
00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:07,660
which is a fascinating,

163
00:06:07,661 --> 00:06:07,811
you know,

164
00:06:07,811 --> 00:06:08,011
there's,

165
00:06:08,011 --> 00:06:11,790
there's a lot of recent research on the
genetics of this stuff and showing this

166
00:06:11,791 --> 00:06:16,220
overlap and it seems to be particularly
associate with this openness that things

167
00:06:16,221 --> 00:06:18,300
really opens and things
related to the default network.

168
00:06:18,301 --> 00:06:21,300
So I think the discovery of the default
mode network in recent years has really

169
00:06:21,301 --> 00:06:22,470
allowed us to understand this.

170
00:06:22,471 --> 00:06:26,420
So my colleagues and I published a paper
recently showing a direct link between

171
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:29,660
the efficiency of the default mode
network and the personality trait.

172
00:06:29,661 --> 00:06:30,770
Openness to experience.

173
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:32,450
Yeah,

174
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:33,080
yeah,

175
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:33,913
sure.

176
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,390
So we can now link,

177
00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:36,220
we can link,

178
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:36,400
you know,

179
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,650
the brain structure and network dynamics.

180
00:06:38,651 --> 00:06:38,891
Okay.

181
00:06:38,891 --> 00:06:43,420
So we used a network approach to look at
the connectivity of the default network

182
00:06:43,421 --> 00:06:47,500
and actually analyze
individual differences in the
connectivity between people

183
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:48,700
within the default network.

184
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:52,680
So as a measure of your efficiency
within that particular brain network as a

185
00:06:52,681 --> 00:06:53,480
start.

186
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:56,450
And that was correlated with the
openness to experience domain.

187
00:06:57,180 --> 00:07:01,260
So what does that mean in increased
connectivity within the default network?

188
00:07:01,261 --> 00:07:02,130
Was associated with.

189
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:02,701
Okay,

190
00:07:02,701 --> 00:07:06,080
and what did the increased
conductivity signify?

191
00:07:06,081 --> 00:07:08,210
What do you think the functional
significance of that is?

192
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:13,470
I think efficiency in the sense of
quicker information flow between the three

193
00:07:13,471 --> 00:07:17,940
major sub hubs of the default mode
network is the three sub networks that

194
00:07:17,941 --> 00:07:19,390
default mode network involved,

195
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:23,500
the meaning making meaning making seems
to be a huge part of this network.

196
00:07:23,501 --> 00:07:23,950
You know,

197
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:25,180
the construction of self.

198
00:07:25,490 --> 00:07:27,500
People who get kind of
this network knocked out,

199
00:07:27,501 --> 00:07:30,530
they don't even know who they are
anymore and I find that fascinating.

200
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,690
And then there's the
mental simulation part,

201
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:34,250
being able to imagine the future.

202
00:07:34,251 --> 00:07:35,180
That's why I've called this network,

203
00:07:35,181 --> 00:07:39,380
like the imagination network to be sexier
about it because I think default mode

204
00:07:39,381 --> 00:07:39,960
is.

205
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:43,110
It connotes that it's kind of a passive
network when it's actually a really

206
00:07:43,111 --> 00:07:44,130
active network.

207
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:44,701
Do you know what I mean?

208
00:07:44,701 --> 00:07:45,460
Like it's not like A.

209
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:45,570
Yeah,

210
00:07:45,570 --> 00:07:46,403
it does sound like it.

211
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:48,770
It does make it sound like it's passive.

212
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:49,191
Hey,

213
00:07:49,191 --> 00:07:51,420
did you see the work done with suicide?

214
00:07:51,421 --> 00:07:55,940
Been showing radical increase in brain
connectivity under the influence of

215
00:07:55,941 --> 00:07:56,450
suicide?

216
00:07:56,450 --> 00:07:57,020
Yeah.

217
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:57,321
Yeah.

218
00:07:57,321 --> 00:08:01,610
I love that and I think we're on the
verge of something really integrated.

219
00:08:01,611 --> 00:08:02,220
Jordan [inaudible],

220
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:06,200
like you wrote that paper with
Rachel Aggretsuko Plant and Collin,

221
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:08,030
you mapped out the whole terrain.

222
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:10,370
I love that because we've
been building off that.

223
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:13,760
You could send you a paper where we had
a synthesis of the whole literature.

224
00:08:13,761 --> 00:08:17,500
We have this hierarchical model of the
cognitive exploration domain where you

225
00:08:17,501 --> 00:08:21,460
have like cognitive exploration at the
top and then you have openness and an

226
00:08:21,461 --> 00:08:22,061
intellect,

227
00:08:22,061 --> 00:08:24,970
which is the paper where we showed
openness until like differentially predict

228
00:08:24,971 --> 00:08:25,720
creative achievement,

229
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:29,400
but then under that you find all sorts
of fastest which contradict which are

230
00:08:29,401 --> 00:08:30,660
negatively correlated with each other.

231
00:08:30,661 --> 00:08:33,000
Even though one step
higher in the hierarchy,

232
00:08:33,001 --> 00:08:34,230
they're positively correlated.

233
00:08:34,231 --> 00:08:34,870
Right?

234
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:35,830
It seems to be going on there,

235
00:08:35,831 --> 00:08:36,071
right?

236
00:08:36,071 --> 00:08:39,880
Is that there are these breed of humans
that can take these contradictory modes

237
00:08:39,881 --> 00:08:41,090
of thought within themselves.

238
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:41,350
You know,

239
00:08:41,350 --> 00:08:41,801
most people,

240
00:08:41,801 --> 00:08:44,780
the general population of all these
sorts of the economy is you're either

241
00:08:44,781 --> 00:08:45,920
selfish or you're not selfish.

242
00:08:45,921 --> 00:08:47,300
You're either compassionate or you're not.

243
00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:47,960
You're either,

244
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:51,360
but it seems like credit people are
amazing at able to like harness these

245
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:54,200
seemingly contradictory
modes of being and well,

246
00:08:54,201 --> 00:08:54,710
you know,

247
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:55,460
I,

248
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:58,390
it's probably a neat process of neoteny,

249
00:08:59,040 --> 00:08:59,510
you know,

250
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:02,620
I think that the creative
people stay immature.

251
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:03,460
I love that.

252
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:03,880
Yeah.

253
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:04,150
Well,

254
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:04,480
I mean,

255
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:04,720
you know,

256
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:09,340
there's a proclivity in evolution
for creatures to evolve towards there

257
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:10,700
neotenous forum.

258
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:11,610
Yeah.

259
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:11,840
Okay.

260
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:12,291
So,

261
00:09:12,291 --> 00:09:15,260
and it looks to me like
the creative types are,

262
00:09:15,410 --> 00:09:19,070
they're sustaining that plasticity
they have is really early children.

263
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:23,840
Maybe they are permanently law to some
degree into that pretend play mode.

264
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:24,200
Okay.

265
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:27,380
That's so characteristic of children
between the age of four and say,

266
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:28,520
well maybe 11,

267
00:09:28,521 --> 00:09:29,360
something like that.

268
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:29,831
Well,

269
00:09:29,831 --> 00:09:31,690
it's good to have both
those things operating,

270
00:09:31,691 --> 00:09:31,901
you know,

271
00:09:31,901 --> 00:09:33,220
because often you talk to people.

272
00:09:33,221 --> 00:09:36,910
This is really characteristic of people
who are sort of on the new age end of

273
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:37,300
the spectrum.

274
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:40,390
Carl Jung said something interesting
once about how people think.

275
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:45,310
He said for most people a thought appears
in their mind and they just accepted

276
00:09:45,311 --> 00:09:46,144
uncritically.

277
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:46,810
Hmm.

278
00:09:46,810 --> 00:09:48,070
So that's the thinking and.

279
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:51,560
But that's not really thinking that would
be more associated perhaps with what

280
00:09:51,561 --> 00:09:54,440
you described as activation
of this imagination network,

281
00:09:54,441 --> 00:09:58,830
but it's a lot more difficult to have
the thoughts appear and then to take them

282
00:09:58,831 --> 00:10:03,390
apart and I think it would be really
worthwhile to analyze the role of,

283
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:07,870
well we know Iq is important in that
obviously because Iq just enables you to

284
00:10:07,871 --> 00:10:09,310
handle a large number of variables.

285
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:09,671
Hey,

286
00:10:09,671 --> 00:10:13,690
did you find out if that increased
activity that you were describing was

287
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:15,460
positively associated with Iq?

288
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:16,140
Okay.

289
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:18,540
I'm so glad you asked that because I was
going to tell you about the follow up

290
00:10:18,541 --> 00:10:19,390
paper and by the way,

291
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:21,940
I want to be totally
fair to my collaborators.

292
00:10:21,941 --> 00:10:23,380
This was led by Roger bed.

293
00:10:23,381 --> 00:10:26,290
I ran something with Martin Seligman
the last four years at Penn called the

294
00:10:26,291 --> 00:10:29,320
imagination institute and as
part of that we put out a,

295
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:32,290
a huge grant for people to do research.

296
00:10:32,291 --> 00:10:34,630
So we funded some of this research
and I was a coauthor and some of these

297
00:10:34,631 --> 00:10:35,330
papers,

298
00:10:35,330 --> 00:10:36,920
but Roger bd did a lot of this work.

299
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,080
Now with that out of the way,

300
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:42,120
the follow up paper showed that increased
connectivity between the executive

301
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:46,200
network and the default mode network
was essential for creative thinking,

302
00:10:46,201 --> 00:10:48,630
so openness to experience is not
equivalent to creative thinking.

303
00:10:48,631 --> 00:10:48,841
Right,

304
00:10:48,841 --> 00:10:51,900
so that's the kind of one step is to show
there's a link between the imagination

305
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:52,111
network,

306
00:10:52,111 --> 00:10:52,920
an openness,

307
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:57,920
but really real novel and meaningful
creative cognition seem to require that

308
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:02,400
both the default mode
network and executive network
executive tension and the

309
00:11:02,401 --> 00:11:03,270
salients network.

310
00:11:03,271 --> 00:11:05,190
Actually the salience network
is an interesting network.

311
00:11:05,191 --> 00:11:08,620
We could talk about the interaction
between those two networks were essential

312
00:11:08,621 --> 00:11:10,870
for the cognition to be
novel and meaningful.

313
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:14,630
That's fascinating because most people
in the general population that santee

314
00:11:14,631 --> 00:11:15,230
correlated,

315
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:18,030
some of these networks are
anti-correlated like most people.

316
00:11:18,031 --> 00:11:21,280
For most people it's like as soon
as you focus on the outside world,

317
00:11:21,281 --> 00:11:23,740
you shut up your imagination
or when you go home,

318
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:24,161
imagine.

319
00:11:24,161 --> 00:11:24,700
Yeah,

320
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:26,170
but creative people who
are really creative,

321
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:28,090
they're like a good at keeping on call.

322
00:11:29,950 --> 00:11:32,640
That really is interesting
because shelly and I,

323
00:11:32,641 --> 00:11:35,460
back when we were doing the creative
achievement questionnaire research,

324
00:11:35,461 --> 00:11:38,100
we kind of thought that one of the
things that might characterize creative

325
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:43,090
people is that ability to switch back
and forth between openness and critical

326
00:11:43,091 --> 00:11:44,980
thinking was under voluntary control

327
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:46,120
suggested.

328
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:48,640
I think to the extent to which
it's under voluntary control.

329
00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:50,240
I wonder how I could study that.

330
00:11:50,241 --> 00:11:52,730
Like we just know that this is
what the brain networks are doing.

331
00:11:52,731 --> 00:11:54,040
They're toggling back and forth,

332
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:54,851
but could we ask,

333
00:11:54,851 --> 00:11:55,780
could we do a report?

334
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,430
It's almost with a sense
that like creative people,

335
00:11:57,431 --> 00:11:58,960
as soon as you ask them to think about it,

336
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:00,160
if they're in the flow state,

337
00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:01,950
then suddenly evaporates.

338
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:02,320
You know?

339
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:02,790
It's like,

340
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:03,001
yeah,

341
00:12:03,001 --> 00:12:03,640
we'll need to.

342
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:04,690
It's hard to tell how much.

343
00:12:04,691 --> 00:12:04,991
Okay,

344
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:05,201
so.

345
00:12:05,201 --> 00:12:05,441
Well,

346
00:12:05,441 --> 00:12:09,220
and of course defining
voluntary scientifically is
not a straightforward thing,

347
00:12:09,221 --> 00:12:14,221
but it'd be interesting to see if people
do think about that is voluntary and if

348
00:12:14,801 --> 00:12:16,090
it's a skill as well.

349
00:12:16,091 --> 00:12:19,420
If it's something that people can learn
to develop because you can to some

350
00:12:19,421 --> 00:12:19,770
degree,

351
00:12:19,770 --> 00:12:23,560
teach people critical thinking like you
can teach them to look at an idea and

352
00:12:23,561 --> 00:12:25,000
break it apart and analyze it,

353
00:12:25,270 --> 00:12:27,700
so all that remains to be determined,

354
00:12:27,701 --> 00:12:28,534
I guess.

355
00:12:29,170 --> 00:12:30,003
Hi everyone.

356
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:33,310
I just wanted to take this moment to
thank you for your support of this podcast

357
00:12:33,311 --> 00:12:34,144
over the years.

358
00:12:34,450 --> 00:12:37,660
It's been a lot of fun doing this
podcast for over the past three years.

359
00:12:38,410 --> 00:12:40,090
If you'd like to further
support the podcast,

360
00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:42,910
I wanted to let you know a few things
you could do to make it a better

361
00:12:42,911 --> 00:12:44,080
experience for you all.

362
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:45,161
First,

363
00:12:45,161 --> 00:12:46,030
I'd really appreciate it.

364
00:12:46,031 --> 00:12:47,950
If you could subscribe
to the show in itunes.

365
00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:51,010
This will help make the show more
prominent and itunes and increase our

366
00:12:51,011 --> 00:12:51,844
listenership.

367
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:55,060
I believe you can describe both on
your phone and on your computer.

368
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:56,201
Second,

369
00:12:56,201 --> 00:12:58,960
it'd be great if you could give the
show a rating and review in itunes.

370
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:01,030
I definitely read all the reviews.

371
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:04,030
Another thing you can do is
donate some money to the show,

372
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:07,840
like under the psychology podcast.com
and clicking on the link support the

373
00:13:07,841 --> 00:13:09,610
podcast at the bottom of the page.

374
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:12,100
That's the psychology podcast.com.

375
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:16,960
Some of you had been noting that the
audio quality was less than optimal thanks

376
00:13:16,961 --> 00:13:18,790
to the donations that
we've been receiving.

377
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:22,990
I'm really excited to announce that in
the next couple of weeks we're gonna have

378
00:13:22,991 --> 00:13:27,991
a completely revamped audio structure
to the show and you should notice a huge

379
00:13:28,001 --> 00:13:29,440
improvement in the audio quality.

380
00:13:29,441 --> 00:13:30,610
Thanks for your patience with that.

381
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:33,280
Thank you for your support
of the show over the years.

382
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:35,380
It's been a real labor of love for me.

383
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:36,341
Okay.

384
00:13:36,341 --> 00:13:37,174
Back to the show.

385
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:40,390
So let's move onto some other topics.

386
00:13:40,391 --> 00:13:42,370
You did this really
interesting study that I read,

387
00:13:42,371 --> 00:13:45,910
you know I wrote about inside of
America with Christine Brophy on the

388
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:49,210
personality of credits we
found we were logging well,

389
00:13:49,211 --> 00:13:50,860
two things we wanted to establish.

390
00:13:50,890 --> 00:13:55,240
The first is we wanted to establish if
there was a coherent group of political

391
00:13:55,241 --> 00:13:56,260
beliefs and attitudes.

392
00:13:56,261 --> 00:14:00,220
Let's say that you could bring under
the rubric of political correctness,

393
00:14:00,530 --> 00:14:00,790
you know,

394
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:04,330
because of course you know that just
because a concept pops up in the popular

395
00:14:04,331 --> 00:14:04,841
literature,

396
00:14:04,841 --> 00:14:05,171
let's say,

397
00:14:05,171 --> 00:14:07,240
or often even in the
psychological literature,

398
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:10,330
that doesn't mean that
the concept has any basis.

399
00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:11,163
In fact,

400
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:15,340
what we did was we did a standard
psychometric investigation and so we

401
00:14:15,341 --> 00:14:18,700
oversampled the politically
correct attitude domain.

402
00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:23,020
We had a bunch of people come up with
questions that seemed to be indicative of

403
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:26,560
what people were describing when they
discuss political correctness in the media

404
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:32,040
and we put together I think 400 questions
and had a very large number of people

405
00:14:32,051 --> 00:14:34,570
answer all of them and then
subjected the question.

406
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:35,291
The answer is two,

407
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:39,940
a factor analysis and came up with a
coherent two factor solution to political

408
00:14:39,941 --> 00:14:40,750
correctness.

409
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:44,110
One that looked like it was associated
with what you might describe as the

410
00:14:44,111 --> 00:14:44,950
radical left,

411
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:48,520
the interventionist radical left and
the other that was more associated with,

412
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:53,940
I would say just left leaning and then
looked at the personality predictors and

413
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,490
personality and cognitive predictors of.

414
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:57,630
Of both of those,

415
00:14:58,030 --> 00:14:58,391
they weren't.

416
00:14:58,391 --> 00:14:59,500
That highly correlated.

417
00:14:59,501 --> 00:15:00,430
Interestingly enough,

418
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:04,890
I mean that was partly because we used
to extraction technique that decreased

419
00:15:04,891 --> 00:15:05,611
the correlations,

420
00:15:05,611 --> 00:15:06,330
but you could,

421
00:15:06,330 --> 00:15:10,940
you could extract are two quite separate
sets of political belief and yeah,

422
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:11,331
trait.

423
00:15:11,331 --> 00:15:13,070
Agreeableness was a good predictor,

424
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:16,440
which was quite interesting because
it hadn't showed up that power trait,

425
00:15:16,441 --> 00:15:19,190
agreeableness and being female as well,

426
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:20,990
which was also quite interesting.

427
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:25,950
We're in a situation now way where it
isn't obvious how men and women are going

428
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:30,951
to cooperate politically because it does
look like our differences are intrinsic

429
00:15:31,551 --> 00:15:35,180
differences in personality and interest
might divide us quite radically

430
00:15:35,181 --> 00:15:38,820
politically and so god only knows how
that's gonna play out on the political

431
00:15:38,821 --> 00:15:39,470
realm.

432
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:39,651
Yeah.

433
00:15:39,651 --> 00:15:40,980
It's really interesting
to think about and I.

434
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:44,650
I've been trying to wrap my head around
the real practical implications when I

435
00:15:44,651 --> 00:15:46,010
look at the data and then try it.

436
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:49,300
Like I'd like to hear your thoughts on
what you think the percentage of this

437
00:15:49,301 --> 00:15:50,410
could really be impactful.

438
00:15:50,411 --> 00:15:54,280
So like I look at a figure the other day
of the overlap of the distribution and

439
00:15:54,281 --> 00:15:57,160
compassion and there is
in the general population,

440
00:15:57,161 --> 00:15:59,410
we're not talking about like
it's a totally different plan,

441
00:15:59,460 --> 00:15:59,710
you know,

442
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:04,240
70 percent overlap and the bfs
that you cocreated with Colin,

443
00:16:04,241 --> 00:16:04,371
but,

444
00:16:04,371 --> 00:16:07,390
and so in that paper recalling looked
at the gender differences and the

445
00:16:07,391 --> 00:16:10,750
different big 10 compassion did
have the largest gender difference.

446
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,730
But if you look at the actual graph,

447
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:12,941
you know,

448
00:16:12,941 --> 00:16:16,210
you see like 70 percent and of course
it doesn't say anything about at the

449
00:16:16,211 --> 00:16:17,044
extremes.

450
00:16:19,430 --> 00:16:21,620
This is something that people
really don't understand.

451
00:16:21,621 --> 00:16:23,660
And social scientists don't
understand that well either.

452
00:16:23,661 --> 00:16:24,530
Although we should.

453
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:28,710
Like there's two things that were not
trained well I think in social scientists.

454
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:33,160
One is consideration of the tails because
the tails have disproportionate impact

455
00:16:33,161 --> 00:16:36,010
on behavior and on political
and economic outcomes.

456
00:16:36,410 --> 00:16:40,370
And then the other is the distribution
problem because most of us are taught

457
00:16:40,371 --> 00:16:43,910
that almost everything is normally
distributed and that actually turns out

458
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:45,680
there's a lot of important
exceptions to that,

459
00:16:45,681 --> 00:16:46,880
including creative achievement.

460
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:48,950
It's not normally distributed at all.

461
00:16:48,951 --> 00:16:49,700
It's just standard.

462
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:54,700
Frito distributed probably be small
differences at the average level and then

463
00:16:54,911 --> 00:16:58,720
walloping differences at the extreme
and then it's the differences at the

464
00:16:58,721 --> 00:17:00,010
extreme that determined behavior.

465
00:17:00,011 --> 00:17:00,850
So for example,

466
00:17:01,090 --> 00:17:01,270
no,

467
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:04,950
there's good evidence that the difference
between men and women with regards to

468
00:17:04,951 --> 00:17:08,370
interest in people versus things
is about one standard deviation,

469
00:17:08,670 --> 00:17:12,330
which is the largest psychometric
difference between the genders.

470
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:14,170
That's been reported as far as I know.

471
00:17:14,710 --> 00:17:16,200
And so then you think,

472
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:16,501
well,

473
00:17:16,501 --> 00:17:17,010
okay,

474
00:17:17,010 --> 00:17:19,920
it still means that men and women
overlapped to a large degree.

475
00:17:19,921 --> 00:17:23,340
But if you look at what
determined someone's decision,

476
00:17:23,341 --> 00:17:23,971
for example,

477
00:17:23,971 --> 00:17:25,860
to go into a field like engineering,

478
00:17:26,290 --> 00:17:27,820
you probably have to be.

479
00:17:28,330 --> 00:17:32,380
I wouldn't think what percentage
of the population are engineers.

480
00:17:32,530 --> 00:17:34,090
I bet it's no more than two percent.

481
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:36,340
Yeah,

482
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:36,641
yeah.

483
00:17:36,641 --> 00:17:36,911
Yeah.

484
00:17:36,911 --> 00:17:37,211
So,

485
00:17:37,211 --> 00:17:37,481
okay,

486
00:17:37,481 --> 00:17:38,800
so let's say one in 50,

487
00:17:38,801 --> 00:17:40,000
maybe it's one in 25,

488
00:17:40,001 --> 00:17:40,511
but whatever.

489
00:17:40,511 --> 00:17:41,261
It's something like that.

490
00:17:41,261 --> 00:17:42,430
Five percent of the population.

491
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,870
So let's say to be an engineer,

492
00:17:44,871 --> 00:17:48,240
well you have to have a high Iq
and you have to be conscientious,

493
00:17:48,490 --> 00:17:50,650
but then you have be interested in things,

494
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:53,440
but you don't have to be just a
little bit interested in things.

495
00:17:53,441 --> 00:17:58,240
You have to be really interested in
things and even if the okay average

496
00:17:58,241 --> 00:18:01,120
difference between men and women
is only one standard deviation,

497
00:18:01,121 --> 00:18:02,530
which is still a comparatively large,

498
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:06,910
that could mean that virtually everybody
who's really interested in things ends

499
00:18:06,911 --> 00:18:09,450
up being male and that's
exactly what you see.

500
00:18:09,451 --> 00:18:13,850
You see about a 15 to one preponderance
of male engineers versus female

501
00:18:13,851 --> 00:18:15,450
engineers and you know,

502
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:16,041
you might say,

503
00:18:16,041 --> 00:18:18,400
well that's socio-cultural and can,

504
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:19,450
can be ameliorated,

505
00:18:19,451 --> 00:18:23,090
but the evidence doesn't support down at
all because those differences maximize

506
00:18:23,091 --> 00:18:24,550
in the Scandinavian countries.

507
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:27,150
You mind if I just think
really interesting.

508
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:28,130
Okay.

509
00:18:28,130 --> 00:18:28,611
And by the way,

510
00:18:28,611 --> 00:18:29,660
I want to thank you for.

511
00:18:29,661 --> 00:18:32,120
I've lost like 100 of your videos
to prepare for this interview.

512
00:18:32,121 --> 00:18:33,930
So like even if I don't
always agree with you,

513
00:18:33,931 --> 00:18:34,231
I,

514
00:18:34,231 --> 00:18:36,690
it helps clarify what in
the hell I actually believe.

515
00:18:36,691 --> 00:18:39,300
So thank you for being so
authentic and your opinions.

516
00:18:39,730 --> 00:18:42,340
I totally believe in
quality of opportunity.

517
00:18:42,550 --> 00:18:42,821
Right?

518
00:18:42,821 --> 00:18:46,810
And it seems like what really irks you
is when people call for equality of

519
00:18:46,811 --> 00:18:47,340
outcome,

520
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:49,000
that that's really where
you know when you're ready.

521
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:50,560
Infuriate is a better way.

522
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:52,180
I know how dangerous it is.

523
00:18:52,181 --> 00:18:53,830
It's unbelievably dangerous.

524
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:57,130
People have no idea what to messing
with when they mess with equality of

525
00:18:57,131 --> 00:18:57,461
outcome.

526
00:18:57,461 --> 00:18:58,070
Well,

527
00:18:58,070 --> 00:19:00,490
and then do you have a
nuanced discussion about it,

528
00:19:00,491 --> 00:19:00,851
let's say,

529
00:19:00,851 --> 00:19:02,110
because that's what we should do.

530
00:19:02,111 --> 00:19:02,441
It's like,

531
00:19:02,441 --> 00:19:03,040
okay,

532
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:08,040
the data indicate more and more strongly
that there are significant differences

533
00:19:08,341 --> 00:19:12,680
between men and women in a variety of
dimensions and more importantly that those

534
00:19:12,681 --> 00:19:16,070
differences expand as cultures
become more egalitarian.

535
00:19:16,910 --> 00:19:17,151
Okay,

536
00:19:17,151 --> 00:19:19,880
so then that opens up an
avenue of political questions.

537
00:19:19,881 --> 00:19:22,390
It's like the first
political question would be,

538
00:19:22,670 --> 00:19:24,530
the first observation should be,

539
00:19:25,050 --> 00:19:29,970
we better accept that as fact because
it actually seems to be grounded in very

540
00:19:29,971 --> 00:19:34,780
serious science and the scientists who
discovered this biased in the opposite

541
00:19:34,781 --> 00:19:35,530
direction,

542
00:19:35,530 --> 00:19:37,480
it wasn't what they were happy to find.

543
00:19:38,270 --> 00:19:39,290
No one expected it.

544
00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:39,931
Okay,

545
00:19:39,931 --> 00:19:41,310
but let's take it at face value.

546
00:19:41,311 --> 00:19:43,230
Just for the sake of argument and say,

547
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:43,561
all right,

548
00:19:43,561 --> 00:19:46,500
now this opens up a minefield
of political questions.

549
00:19:47,210 --> 00:19:48,043
The first is,

550
00:19:48,190 --> 00:19:49,240
so for example,

551
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:52,910
let me take a pro diversity
stamps just for a minute,

552
00:19:53,410 --> 00:19:55,480
even though it hurts my heart to do so,

553
00:19:56,170 --> 00:20:01,170
so it looks like if we
allowed naturalistic sorting
to take place merely as a

554
00:20:01,931 --> 00:20:03,970
consequence of people's express choices,

555
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:07,460
that all of the elementary school
teachers would end up being women.

556
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:09,101
Yeah,

557
00:20:09,101 --> 00:20:09,631
well it's so,

558
00:20:09,631 --> 00:20:13,100
so it's going to be there and it already
is the vast majority of the budget.

559
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:15,390
If the sorting continues unabated,

560
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:17,740
that's likely to increase that.

561
00:20:17,741 --> 00:20:19,180
Increasingly it is what it is,

562
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:22,630
but we don't know what to do about
that from a sociopolitical perspective.

563
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:23,500
Now you know,

564
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:26,740
hypothetically we could
enforce equity of outcome,

565
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:28,220
equality of outcome,

566
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:30,800
but it would be extremely costly.

567
00:20:31,310 --> 00:20:35,810
It would require a tyrannical effort
on the part of the government and there

568
00:20:35,811 --> 00:20:39,080
would be all sorts of unintended
negative consequences.

569
00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:39,501
Now,

570
00:20:39,501 --> 00:20:42,170
those might be consequences
that we're willing to bear,

571
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:46,460
but we don't want to move into this
under the presupposition that the

572
00:20:46,461 --> 00:20:47,200
differences.

573
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:50,890
We're trying to eradicate our only
socio-cultural in nature because clearly

574
00:20:50,891 --> 00:20:54,500
they're not and you'd hope that we
would get to the point where we could

575
00:20:54,501 --> 00:20:56,350
actually have an intelligent
discussion about it.

576
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,120
We don't know what to do about this.

577
00:20:58,470 --> 00:20:59,303
That's the thing,

578
00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:00,751
the proposal,

579
00:21:00,751 --> 00:21:02,880
what to do about it in one of your videos,

580
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:06,450
the one that I talked about because you
actually made a concrete I and one of

581
00:21:06,451 --> 00:21:09,260
the videos I watched you made
a very specific argument.

582
00:21:09,261 --> 00:21:09,531
You said,

583
00:21:09,531 --> 00:21:11,390
I think that we should eliminate poverty,

584
00:21:11,630 --> 00:21:14,350
that we should have eliminated
unnecessary suffering,

585
00:21:14,351 --> 00:21:14,531
you know,

586
00:21:14,531 --> 00:21:17,650
give everyone a relative
sort of baseline of income.

587
00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:20,400
But then after that is the next stage,

588
00:21:20,401 --> 00:21:24,310
we should sort of allow the free market
to sort of like allow people to then

589
00:21:24,690 --> 00:21:25,061
express.

590
00:21:25,061 --> 00:21:25,920
So you still stand by that.

591
00:21:25,921 --> 00:21:27,900
Will you send that video about
their function of the state?

592
00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:28,720
Well,

593
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:31,570
I don't know because it's
so complicated like I don't,

594
00:21:31,870 --> 00:21:35,740
I certainly don't think that we should
rush headlong into the provision of a

595
00:21:35,741 --> 00:21:39,930
universal basic income because the
probability that that will have radically

596
00:21:39,931 --> 00:21:42,630
unintended consequences
is unbelievably high.

597
00:21:42,950 --> 00:21:45,380
So I think one of the things
that would probably do,

598
00:21:45,381 --> 00:21:47,450
especially among unemployed,

599
00:21:47,451 --> 00:21:48,500
hopeless people,

600
00:21:48,501 --> 00:21:53,150
is increase their access to
drugs like oxycontin and opiates.

601
00:21:53,670 --> 00:21:58,670
See the problem with the left wing view
of improving economic equality is the

602
00:21:58,841 --> 00:22:02,770
left wingers are so obsessed with the
economic side of inequality that they

603
00:22:02,771 --> 00:22:05,560
don't pay enough attention to
the cultural side of inequality.

604
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:09,540
So if you're down at the
bottom of the economic pyramid,

605
00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:12,440
the fact that you don't have
enough money is a big problem,

606
00:22:12,441 --> 00:22:15,230
but it's only one of many
serious problems you have.

607
00:22:15,530 --> 00:22:19,370
And I would say an equally serious
problem is that you don't have anything

608
00:22:19,371 --> 00:22:20,061
productive,

609
00:22:20,061 --> 00:22:22,730
engaging and meaningful
to do with your time.

610
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:24,700
And the problem with that is that,

611
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:25,370
you know,

612
00:22:25,370 --> 00:22:26,570
I don't know if you know this or not,

613
00:22:26,571 --> 00:22:31,150
but it's pretty easy to get rats that
are isolated in a cage singly to be

614
00:22:31,151 --> 00:22:32,170
addicted to cocaine.

615
00:22:33,110 --> 00:22:34,370
You can do it very rapidly,

616
00:22:34,371 --> 00:22:38,060
but it's almost impossible to get
routes in the naturalistic environment

617
00:22:38,061 --> 00:22:39,020
addicted to cocaine.

618
00:22:39,870 --> 00:22:40,920
That's really interesting.

619
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:41,760
It is.

620
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:42,031
Yeah.

621
00:22:42,031 --> 00:22:42,181
Well,

622
00:22:42,181 --> 00:22:43,014
there was there.

623
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:47,240
He followed just slouched behaviorist
that studied routes in their natural

624
00:22:47,241 --> 00:22:50,690
environment and they're quite a bit
different than the genetically modified

625
00:22:50,810 --> 00:22:55,810
three quarter bodyweight starved single
lab rat existing alone in the cage.

626
00:22:56,210 --> 00:22:57,650
Rats are social creatures,

627
00:22:57,651 --> 00:22:58,484
you know?

628
00:22:59,630 --> 00:22:59,841
Yeah.

629
00:22:59,841 --> 00:23:02,270
Well if you were sitting alone in prison,

630
00:23:02,650 --> 00:23:03,070
yeah,

631
00:23:03,070 --> 00:23:06,690
and somebody and offered you
an endless access to cocaine,

632
00:23:06,691 --> 00:23:09,730
it's like the probability that
you take it is extremely high,

633
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,310
but if you have something
better to do then it's low.

634
00:23:12,690 --> 00:23:15,860
The problem we're going to have to
deal with is more like provision of

635
00:23:15,861 --> 00:23:20,420
meaningful activity to people who
are being displaced by large scale

636
00:23:20,421 --> 00:23:22,080
socioeconomic transformation.

637
00:23:22,330 --> 00:23:25,240
That's not a matter of
merely redistributing income.

638
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:27,830
Do you know the video I'm talking about
when you talk about the function of the

639
00:23:27,831 --> 00:23:28,664
state?

640
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:28,941
Yeah.

641
00:23:28,941 --> 00:23:29,271
I think.

642
00:23:29,271 --> 00:23:32,900
I think I would send a political
convention in Canada about five years ago.

643
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:35,120
I've done work on what are called like.

644
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:36,240
I've done work on giftedness.

645
00:23:36,241 --> 00:23:38,040
I've been working on kids
with learning disabilities.

646
00:23:38,041 --> 00:23:38,400
Trying to.

647
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,610
The equality of opportunity
is what I'm playing for.

648
00:23:40,650 --> 00:23:41,330
That's what I'm.

649
00:23:41,330 --> 00:23:43,620
And in terms of aligning it
with the science as well,

650
00:23:43,621 --> 00:23:44,130
you know,

651
00:23:44,130 --> 00:23:46,860
it's a beautiful thing me
when they are not a post,

652
00:23:46,861 --> 00:23:50,120
when there's the truth and the
helping someone or you know,

653
00:23:50,121 --> 00:23:50,720
the same thing,

654
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:50,930
you know,

655
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:51,621
that's a beautiful thing,

656
00:23:51,621 --> 00:23:52,280
right?

657
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:52,570
Yeah.

658
00:23:52,570 --> 00:23:53,403
So

659
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:54,950
this is an interesting question,

660
00:23:54,951 --> 00:23:58,620
is like what could the function of the
state opportunity b too helped her make

661
00:23:58,621 --> 00:24:01,260
sure that there's a quality
of individual expression?

662
00:24:01,261 --> 00:24:02,520
I guess that's what
we're talking about here.

663
00:24:02,670 --> 00:24:03,503
Well that's written.

664
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:05,850
That is a fundamental question.

665
00:24:05,851 --> 00:24:07,170
I mean million dollar question.

666
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:07,901
Yeah.

667
00:24:07,901 --> 00:24:11,080
Well one of the things the state does
quite effectively is invest in universally

668
00:24:11,081 --> 00:24:12,340
accessible infrastructure.

669
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:15,150
So everybody benefits from safe,

670
00:24:15,270 --> 00:24:16,410
clean streets,

671
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:17,140
right?

672
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:20,880
And everybody benefits from
it on active cultural meal.

673
00:24:20,881 --> 00:24:25,110
You like a city like Montreal is a really
good example that is extraordinarily

674
00:24:25,111 --> 00:24:25,950
culturally active.

675
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:28,950
There's festivals going on there all
the time and a lot of them are outside.

676
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:30,270
A lot of them are free.

677
00:24:30,450 --> 00:24:31,800
Everyone benefits from that.

678
00:24:32,030 --> 00:24:34,480
Education is a good hypothetically,

679
00:24:34,481 --> 00:24:38,050
a good place for the state to invest
with regards to equality of opportunity.

680
00:24:38,051 --> 00:24:41,680
Although it disproportionately benefits
people who are on the upper end of the

681
00:24:41,681 --> 00:24:42,850
cognitive distribution,

682
00:24:43,350 --> 00:24:44,930
it's hard to escape from that a.

683
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:47,440
So that's for sure.

684
00:24:48,050 --> 00:24:52,520
Back to the back to the
intrinsic difference issue
is like we don't really know

685
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:57,800
what the political impact is of the fact
that men and women seem highly likely

686
00:24:59,501 --> 00:25:04,501
to sort themselves out into different
occupations if we just allow them free

687
00:25:04,681 --> 00:25:08,600
choice cause no one has thought that no
one thought that was what was going to

688
00:25:08,601 --> 00:25:09,240
happen.

689
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:10,510
You know when the bloody okay,

690
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:14,140
radical leftists are fighting this like
mad because they insist that all these

691
00:25:14,141 --> 00:25:15,730
differences are associate cultural,

692
00:25:15,731 --> 00:25:18,100
but the problem is it
doesn't look like they are

693
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:20,740
all of these politics and fractions,

694
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:21,500
right?

695
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:22,390
Individual differences.

696
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,740
What is fits fascinates me.

697
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,580
People are complex systems.

698
00:25:26,670 --> 00:25:29,340
Every one of us is a complex system
of lots of personality traits,

699
00:25:29,341 --> 00:25:29,941
motivations,

700
00:25:29,941 --> 00:25:31,540
etc. And you know,

701
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:34,350
there are people who score high on
compassion regardless of whether you're a

702
00:25:34,351 --> 00:25:34,981
male or female.

703
00:25:34,981 --> 00:25:35,820
A lot of ice score.

704
00:25:35,821 --> 00:25:39,000
High question I heard you say you score
high on capacity in one of your videos.

705
00:25:39,001 --> 00:25:39,210
You know,

706
00:25:39,210 --> 00:25:40,290
when you went through the bfs,

707
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:41,850
so it's not like we're saying like,

708
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:42,190
you know,

709
00:25:42,190 --> 00:25:43,680
you have to be female to be competitive,

710
00:25:43,950 --> 00:25:44,521
which is funny.

711
00:25:44,521 --> 00:25:46,350
With the politically
correct research we did,

712
00:25:46,351 --> 00:25:48,990
we did find that a lot
of the predictive power,

713
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:54,230
a lot of what was predicting affiliation
with politically correct standpoint was

714
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:55,640
trait agreeableness,

715
00:25:55,880 --> 00:26:00,280
but being female was an
additional predictor and that
was really strange because

716
00:26:00,281 --> 00:26:01,150
most of the time,

717
00:26:01,151 --> 00:26:04,840
and I'm sure this is the
case with literature that
you've investigated as well.

718
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:09,050
Most of the time if you look at sex
differences in a particular outcome,

719
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:11,810
you can get rid of them by
controlling for temperament,

720
00:26:12,050 --> 00:26:15,150
but you could most of them look like
we didn't know there was an additional

721
00:26:15,151 --> 00:26:17,100
effect of there was an additional effect.

722
00:26:17,190 --> 00:26:17,830
Sex.

723
00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:18,663
Yeah.

724
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:20,340
Did you look at politeness versus

725
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:21,513
passion?

726
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:22,061
Yes,

727
00:26:22,061 --> 00:26:22,421
we did,

728
00:26:22,421 --> 00:26:23,254
but I can't.

729
00:26:23,370 --> 00:26:26,580
It's been a while since I reviewed the
paper and I can't bring it to mind.

730
00:26:26,890 --> 00:26:27,161
Okay.

731
00:26:27,161 --> 00:26:27,340
No,

732
00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:29,500
I think it was driven
mostly by compassion,

733
00:26:29,501 --> 00:26:30,640
if I remember correctly.

734
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:31,470
Yup.

735
00:26:31,470 --> 00:26:32,360
And it makes sense,

736
00:26:32,361 --> 00:26:32,580
you know,

737
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:36,040
because I think that what's
happening on the end of the spectrum,

738
00:26:36,041 --> 00:26:38,380
let's say political views
are driven by compassion,

739
00:26:38,381 --> 00:26:43,381
is compassion is primarily a dimension
that's there to facilitate intense

740
00:26:43,611 --> 00:26:47,560
relationships between
individuals and their dependents.

741
00:26:47,770 --> 00:26:50,710
Which kind of looks to me like
what compassion does is that,

742
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:51,401
so you know,

743
00:26:51,401 --> 00:26:54,420
you have compassion for an infant or
you have compassion for someone who's

744
00:26:54,421 --> 00:26:55,500
elderly and unwell.

745
00:26:55,710 --> 00:26:57,300
If you're a very compassionate person,

746
00:26:57,301 --> 00:27:02,301
it's very easy to take the side of the
downtrodden and to look for a perpetrator

747
00:27:03,521 --> 00:27:05,410
or cars and lots of time.

748
00:27:05,411 --> 00:27:06,550
That's extremely useful,

749
00:27:06,551 --> 00:27:06,761
right?

750
00:27:06,761 --> 00:27:09,610
If you're taking care of an infant
and the infant is in distress,

751
00:27:10,110 --> 00:27:13,320
the first thing you should be doing is
scanning the environment for the cause

752
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:14,700
and eliminating it.

753
00:27:15,330 --> 00:27:17,390
One Answered question is,

754
00:27:17,391 --> 00:27:17,541
well,

755
00:27:17,541 --> 00:27:22,040
what happens when you scale up that
personality attribute and it starts to

756
00:27:22,041 --> 00:27:23,000
operate politically?

757
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:24,830
Here's some.

758
00:27:24,830 --> 00:27:25,770
Here's the thought for you.

759
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:27,010
Tell me what you think about this.

760
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:32,750
I think that we have to traits
that orient us in the social world.

761
00:27:33,210 --> 00:27:38,210
I think agreeable disorients us in small
groups and conscientiousness orients us

762
00:27:38,821 --> 00:27:39,541
in large,

763
00:27:39,541 --> 00:27:42,590
impersonal groups and
that the switch point,

764
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:47,700
the point where you transitioned from an
agreeable viewpoint to a conscientious

765
00:27:47,701 --> 00:27:48,534
viewpoint is,

766
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:49,980
is indeterminate.

767
00:27:50,510 --> 00:27:53,230
Is tHere a sex difference on the
conscientiousness are males tire?

768
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:54,810
No,

769
00:27:54,810 --> 00:27:56,090
you're a little more orderly.

770
00:27:56,450 --> 00:27:56,720
Okay.

771
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:58,260
And men are a little more into distress.

772
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:59,040
It does,

773
00:27:59,040 --> 00:27:59,231
yeah.

774
00:27:59,231 --> 00:28:02,600
I was going to ask industrious in
particular because roy baumeister made a

775
00:28:02,601 --> 00:28:02,990
similar.

776
00:28:02,990 --> 00:28:05,950
You could link that to roy baumeister's
argument and what are men good for?

777
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:06,920
I think that's the title of the book.

778
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:09,180
He argues that that's
the major sex difference,

779
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:12,250
that it's not like men or women
are better than each other.

780
00:28:12,251 --> 00:28:15,670
It's that like there have been different
motivations in terms of how we want to

781
00:28:15,671 --> 00:28:19,170
help people and a lot of men have tended
throughout the course of history to

782
00:28:19,171 --> 00:28:19,710
wanting to help,

783
00:28:19,710 --> 00:28:20,011
you know,

784
00:28:20,011 --> 00:28:23,820
like a huge social networks have huge
social networks and I wonder if that's a

785
00:28:23,821 --> 00:28:25,080
difference in exactly what you're saying.

786
00:28:25,410 --> 00:28:25,621
Well,

787
00:28:25,621 --> 00:28:26,580
I think it might be.

788
00:28:26,581 --> 00:28:27,480
I think it might.

789
00:28:28,230 --> 00:28:29,063
Look,

790
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:30,340
human beings are strange.

791
00:28:30,370 --> 00:28:30,940
First of all,

792
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:32,950
there's no animal warden
for conscientiousness.

793
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:33,740
Yeah.

794
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:33,921
Oh,

795
00:28:33,921 --> 00:28:34,754
is that right?

796
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:35,170
Oh,

797
00:28:35,170 --> 00:28:36,080
I've never seen one.

798
00:28:36,530 --> 00:28:36,631
Oh,

799
00:28:36,631 --> 00:28:37,610
that's so interesting.

800
00:28:37,970 --> 00:28:38,151
You know,

801
00:28:38,151 --> 00:28:38,491
it's funny,

802
00:28:38,491 --> 00:28:39,750
I was chatting with column the other day.

803
00:28:39,751 --> 00:28:40,261
He said that,

804
00:28:40,261 --> 00:28:40,441
um,

805
00:28:40,441 --> 00:28:44,190
they just found a correlation between the
salients network and conscientiousness

806
00:28:44,191 --> 00:28:45,990
and that's not really well evolved

807
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:47,500
in other animals.

808
00:28:47,530 --> 00:28:48,580
That's just interesting.

809
00:28:49,290 --> 00:28:50,080
So look,

810
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:51,220
if you think about it this way,

811
00:28:51,221 --> 00:28:55,990
if you think that imagine that there's a
human niche niche distinguishes us from

812
00:28:55,991 --> 00:28:58,010
animals and I mean obviously there is,

813
00:28:58,011 --> 00:29:03,011
but one of the distinguishing elements
is that we can produce groups whose size

814
00:29:04,010 --> 00:29:08,220
exceeds that of our
primate cognitive capacity.

815
00:29:08,930 --> 00:29:09,101
So,

816
00:29:09,101 --> 00:29:09,760
you know,

817
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:13,060
I think it's dunbar's work
indicates that with human beings,

818
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:18,150
our tribes tend to fractionate when
they exceed about a group of about 200,

819
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:21,130
but obviously we can produce
groups that are much,

820
00:29:21,131 --> 00:29:23,080
much larger than that that are functional.

821
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:26,510
But what that means is that those groups
have to operate on principles that are

822
00:29:26,511 --> 00:29:30,200
outside of the networks that other
primates would use to organize themselves

823
00:29:30,201 --> 00:29:30,890
socially.

824
00:29:30,890 --> 00:29:33,320
And I think that's where
conscientiousness kicks in.

825
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:34,061
Well,

826
00:29:34,061 --> 00:29:38,030
and if you look at what predicts
performance in bureaucracies,

827
00:29:38,550 --> 00:29:39,840
it's conscientiousness,

828
00:29:40,490 --> 00:29:41,560
snot agreeableness.

829
00:29:41,561 --> 00:29:41,951
In fact,

830
00:29:41,951 --> 00:29:46,020
agreeableness is slightly correlated
negatively with managerial performance and

831
00:29:46,021 --> 00:29:46,580
so,

832
00:29:46,580 --> 00:29:46,810
okay.

833
00:29:46,810 --> 00:29:50,200
I think once a group exceeds
the size where it's familiar,

834
00:29:50,670 --> 00:29:54,560
then you have to use a different ethical
system to cope with it and that's

835
00:29:54,561 --> 00:29:57,800
conscientiousness and I think one of
the problems with what's happening to us

836
00:29:57,801 --> 00:29:59,990
politically right now is that
we're trying to implement.

837
00:29:59,991 --> 00:30:04,310
Agreeableness has a political trait and
I don't think it functions well in large

838
00:30:04,311 --> 00:30:05,144
groups.

839
00:30:05,370 --> 00:30:06,360
I hear that argument.

840
00:30:06,361 --> 00:30:11,361
I think sometimes some of the things that
you are perceiving as relevant to the

841
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:12,200
agreeableness,

842
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:15,140
to me it might be actually
something different and let
me elaborate what I mean.

843
00:30:15,430 --> 00:30:16,640
So I've done some research lately.

844
00:30:16,641 --> 00:30:20,120
I realized that there's no
scale of pathological altruism.

845
00:30:20,121 --> 00:30:23,210
It's a construct that barbara
oakley has written about,

846
00:30:23,211 --> 00:30:25,340
but I want to do systematic
research on this.

847
00:30:25,341 --> 00:30:27,080
I think this is relevant
to this conversation,

848
00:30:27,790 --> 00:30:32,570
so I constructed a reliable and valid
scale of pathological altruism and it is

849
00:30:32,571 --> 00:30:34,820
negatively correlated with
agreeableness and compassion.

850
00:30:35,390 --> 00:30:37,190
We're not talking about
it's in that domain.

851
00:30:37,670 --> 00:30:41,540
What did you find were the defining
characteristics of pathological altruism?

852
00:30:42,030 --> 00:30:42,421
Okay,

853
00:30:42,421 --> 00:30:46,110
so we looked at grandiose narcissism
versus vulnerable narcissism.

854
00:30:46,111 --> 00:30:47,790
I am so fascinated with that distinction.

855
00:30:47,791 --> 00:30:51,610
I don't think vulnerable narcissism has
got as much attention in the literature.

856
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:53,260
We found about point six,

857
00:30:53,261 --> 00:30:53,831
point seven,

858
00:30:53,831 --> 00:30:57,040
correlation between pathological
altruism and vulnerable narcissism.

859
00:30:58,720 --> 00:30:59,250
Okay.

860
00:30:59,250 --> 00:31:01,170
Vulnerable narcissism is this,

861
00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:02,320
they called it a psychoanalyst,

862
00:31:02,330 --> 00:31:06,560
got a closet narcism where it's like you
have these grandiose fantasies inside

863
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:07,520
and you have entitlement,

864
00:31:07,521 --> 00:31:10,040
so you score score skyhigh on entitlement.

865
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:13,310
However you don't present
yourself that way.

866
00:31:13,311 --> 00:31:16,130
You present yourself as really vulnerable.

867
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:18,580
We find that the grandiose
narcissism vulnerable,

868
00:31:18,581 --> 00:31:22,540
so they score high on the grandiose
fantasies questionnaIre and entitlement

869
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:24,820
subscale differentiates them,

870
00:31:24,821 --> 00:31:26,050
is trait neuroticism.

871
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:27,580
That's the thing that differentiates them,

872
00:31:27,910 --> 00:31:30,890
so whereas grandiose narcissism
is with much lower in neuroticism,

873
00:31:31,230 --> 00:31:34,140
vulnerable narcissism almost perfectly
correlated with high neuroticism,

874
00:31:34,630 --> 00:31:36,160
almost perfectly correlated,

875
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:37,733
correlated

876
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:41,540
one of my collaborators who on that paper
he wrote another paper with a title.

877
00:31:41,630 --> 00:31:44,330
Vulnerable narcissism is
mostly just neuroticism.

878
00:31:44,331 --> 00:31:46,100
We're talking about if
you do a structural model,

879
00:31:46,101 --> 00:31:48,050
we're talking literally
almost perfectly correlated.

880
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:51,740
The only thing that additional variants
that's explained as some antagonism,

881
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:52,281
like I said,

882
00:31:52,281 --> 00:31:53,510
entitlement for instance,

883
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:57,690
it's a subset of highly neurotic people
who also have developed a sense of

884
00:31:57,780 --> 00:31:58,410
entitlement,

885
00:31:58,410 --> 00:31:59,243
entitlement,

886
00:31:59,250 --> 00:31:59,820
and assertive,

887
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:01,620
interpersonal antagonism towards others.

888
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:02,670
So we're not talking about

889
00:32:03,930 --> 00:32:05,600
you guys are really onto something there.

890
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:06,261
Great,

891
00:32:06,261 --> 00:32:06,600
great.

892
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:06,770
Yeah.

893
00:32:06,770 --> 00:32:07,010
Yeah.

894
00:32:07,010 --> 00:32:07,880
I really think so.

895
00:32:07,881 --> 00:32:12,460
I mean the question is whether or not
you're just fleshing out neuroticism with

896
00:32:12,461 --> 00:32:15,780
those sorts of correlations or whether
you've got a subset of people in there

897
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:18,310
who have taken neuroticism
to the next step.

898
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:22,020
I don't think it's synonymous with
eroticism because most people who present

899
00:32:22,021 --> 00:32:24,750
themselves with high neuroticism
to the therapist as you know,

900
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:25,830
if they are depressed,

901
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:28,920
not like they have this grandiose
fantasy is an entitlement.

902
00:32:29,190 --> 00:32:32,310
Early developmental experiences seems
to be a really interesting moderator.

903
00:32:32,311 --> 00:32:32,940
We found.

904
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:36,610
We found that those who were told that
they're worthless and childhood or that

905
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:40,920
were actually in some sense did experience
sort of trauma in their childhood.

906
00:32:41,190 --> 00:32:43,860
That seems to actually
correlate with later on.

907
00:32:43,861 --> 00:32:46,310
And I think that from a
clinician perspective,

908
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:46,810
you know,

909
00:32:46,810 --> 00:32:50,050
we want to help these individuals
integrate health lena society and I think

910
00:32:50,051 --> 00:32:52,360
maybe that's where your responsibility
argument comes into play.

911
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:54,860
Well the union idea behind that was the,

912
00:32:54,910 --> 00:32:57,410
those grandiose fantasies
were compensations,

913
00:32:57,411 --> 00:32:57,681
right?

914
00:32:57,681 --> 00:32:59,090
And that within them,

915
00:32:59,240 --> 00:32:59,460
okaY,

916
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:02,490
there was the seeds in some sense
of the developmental pathway.

917
00:33:02,491 --> 00:33:06,480
So if someone is oppressed and put down
continually and they develop competence,

918
00:33:06,481 --> 00:33:07,530
suntory fantasies,

919
00:33:07,810 --> 00:33:11,320
the fantasies are you can think about
them as the manifestation of that

920
00:33:11,321 --> 00:33:12,520
imagination network,

921
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:15,420
trying to lay out an
alternative mode of being.

922
00:33:15,750 --> 00:33:19,650
But then those fantasies have to be
subject to critical analysis so they don't

923
00:33:19,651 --> 00:33:24,390
become dwelling places or reasons for
bitterness in relationship to the world.

924
00:33:24,750 --> 00:33:28,250
We just came full circle in the
sense that in a way that started this

925
00:33:28,251 --> 00:33:28,761
discussion,

926
00:33:28,761 --> 00:33:28,971
you know,

927
00:33:28,971 --> 00:33:29,930
like this interplay,

928
00:33:29,931 --> 00:33:33,210
but dynamic interplay between imagination
and then rationality and this.

929
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:33,811
Well,

930
00:33:33,811 --> 00:33:35,250
the problem with those fantasies,

931
00:33:35,251 --> 00:33:38,340
well the problem with those fantasies
is that they're not decomposed.

932
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:38,810
Yeah.

933
00:33:38,810 --> 00:33:43,170
So like if you're dealing with someone
that's someone clinically and they have

934
00:33:43,171 --> 00:33:44,040
these fantasies,

935
00:33:44,070 --> 00:33:48,250
then you might think about them as a
starting place for how they could more

936
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:49,570
modified their life.

937
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:54,890
so the fantasy is saying the fantasy is
serving as a counterpart to the painful

938
00:33:54,891 --> 00:33:55,724
reality.

939
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:57,600
The painful reality is downtrodden,

940
00:33:57,601 --> 00:33:58,434
neuroticism.

941
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:03,400
The fantasy is as far on the other end
of the scale as like it balances the

942
00:34:03,401 --> 00:34:07,300
pathology by putting something on the
other end of the scale that's equally far

943
00:34:07,301 --> 00:34:07,930
away.

944
00:34:07,930 --> 00:34:12,250
Then you have to help the person take a
critical look at the fantasy and start

945
00:34:12,251 --> 00:34:16,790
to make it a reality instead of just a
fantasy and to lay out a strategic plan

946
00:34:16,791 --> 00:34:17,624
for doing that.

947
00:34:18,090 --> 00:34:18,810
Exactly,

948
00:34:18,810 --> 00:34:19,540
exactly.

949
00:34:19,540 --> 00:34:19,781
You know,

950
00:34:19,781 --> 00:34:20,190
I mean look,

951
00:34:20,190 --> 00:34:20,441
we,

952
00:34:20,441 --> 00:34:21,061
we're all human.

953
00:34:21,061 --> 00:34:23,250
Like I personally went through a stage.

954
00:34:23,251 --> 00:34:24,660
I think when I was in my early twenties,

955
00:34:24,690 --> 00:34:26,130
I was so insecure.

956
00:34:26,131 --> 00:34:27,830
Like I wanted it to be like academic.

957
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:28,720
I wanted to like,

958
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:31,590
that was my way of proving that I
was smart and that wasn't healthy,

959
00:34:31,591 --> 00:34:31,891
you know,

960
00:34:31,891 --> 00:34:32,850
and like I get it.

961
00:34:32,851 --> 00:34:33,840
But I also get,

962
00:34:34,060 --> 00:34:34,391
you know,

963
00:34:34,391 --> 00:34:39,100
the value of when I really decided to
take some of these grandiose fantasies I

964
00:34:39,101 --> 00:34:40,660
had of being an academic and I say,

965
00:34:40,661 --> 00:34:40,991
well look,

966
00:34:40,991 --> 00:34:41,620
you know,

967
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:44,500
I'm going to just take it out of my
head and I'm going to like work really

968
00:34:44,501 --> 00:34:45,131
freaking hard.

969
00:34:45,131 --> 00:34:45,281
I mean,

970
00:34:45,281 --> 00:34:48,640
I was in special education as a kid
because I didn't auditory disability.

971
00:34:48,890 --> 00:34:49,051
Yeah.

972
00:34:49,051 --> 00:34:50,620
But I was really young at one point.

973
00:34:50,621 --> 00:34:52,990
I just took 100 percent
responsibility for that situation.

974
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:53,531
Okay.

975
00:34:53,531 --> 00:34:55,210
So you took the right route out of that.

976
00:34:55,211 --> 00:34:56,770
They'd have those fantasies,

977
00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:01,800
like you can think of those fantasies
as part of the attempt by the,

978
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:06,320
the mechanism that generates creativity
to lay out a pathway forward.

979
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:07,301
The problem is,

980
00:35:07,301 --> 00:35:08,800
is when people dwell in,

981
00:35:08,801 --> 00:35:13,410
the founder sees and dwell
on the fantasies instead
of instead of breaking them

982
00:35:13,411 --> 00:35:15,930
down into a strategic
plan and realizing them,

983
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:18,880
which is what a good therapist
should help someone with.

984
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:19,933
Absolutely.

985
00:35:20,090 --> 00:35:21,430
I'm sure you've done
that in your practice.

986
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:22,770
You were in practice over 20 years,

987
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:23,320
just.

988
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:23,680
Yep.

989
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:24,240
Yeah,

990
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:24,670
I'm sure.

991
00:35:24,670 --> 00:35:24,841
Yeah.

992
00:35:24,841 --> 00:35:25,040
Well,

993
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:28,940
it's also what happens with our future
authoring program because what we really

994
00:35:28,941 --> 00:35:32,690
asked people to do in the future authoring
program is to generate a competence

995
00:35:32,691 --> 00:35:33,800
satori fantasy.

996
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:34,901
Right now we say,

997
00:35:34,901 --> 00:35:35,081
well,

998
00:35:35,081 --> 00:35:39,670
he lay out how your life could improved
then imagine what your life would be

999
00:35:39,671 --> 00:35:41,620
like if all those improvements took place,

1000
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:43,330
but we don't stop with that.

1001
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:43,690
Okay.

1002
00:35:43,690 --> 00:35:44,201
Then we say,

1003
00:35:44,201 --> 00:35:44,501
okay,

1004
00:35:44,501 --> 00:35:48,090
now subject that to
some critical analysis,

1005
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:49,050
decompose it,

1006
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:50,880
make it into a strategic plan,

1007
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:54,850
break it down into things you would do
day by day and week by week so they can

1008
00:35:54,940 --> 00:35:56,770
become realizable in the world.

1009
00:35:57,250 --> 00:35:57,780
Yeah.

1010
00:35:57,780 --> 00:35:58,021
Yeah.

1011
00:35:58,021 --> 00:35:58,140
Well,

1012
00:35:58,140 --> 00:35:59,160
I mean that's so sensible,

1013
00:35:59,161 --> 00:35:59,391
right?

1014
00:35:59,391 --> 00:36:00,090
I mean it's like,

1015
00:36:00,090 --> 00:36:00,391
by the way,

1016
00:36:00,391 --> 00:36:01,530
this paper I can send to you,

1017
00:36:01,531 --> 00:36:03,120
it's actually under review right now.

1018
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:06,410
We have a whole section on the clinical
implications of these findings and

1019
00:36:08,190 --> 00:36:08,610
yeah,

1020
00:36:08,610 --> 00:36:09,443
I'd like to see it.

1021
00:36:09,670 --> 00:36:11,550
Roy baumeister a really
interesting book on.

1022
00:36:11,740 --> 00:36:15,400
I think it's the best sort of
real honest assessment of evil.

1023
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:17,710
Have you read the evil inside
human violence and cruelty?

1024
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:18,481
No,

1025
00:36:18,481 --> 00:36:19,350
I haven't read it yet.

1026
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:19,780
No.

1027
00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:20,510
NoW something.

1028
00:36:20,510 --> 00:36:23,800
He talks in there because he wants to get
a full understanding of all the causal

1029
00:36:23,801 --> 00:36:26,680
forces of what we call evil and something
in there he talks about is he makes it

1030
00:36:26,681 --> 00:36:28,950
so clear that responsibilities
not the same as culpability,

1031
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,590
like responsibility at
the same thing as bleeding

1032
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:32,900
the situation you just described,

1033
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:37,710
like let's say that you are
high in neuroticism and you
were subject to bullying

1034
00:36:37,830 --> 00:36:40,110
of a real sort and trauma
when you were a kid.

1035
00:36:40,410 --> 00:36:40,561
Well,

1036
00:36:40,561 --> 00:36:42,900
it's not like you're culpable for that.

1037
00:36:43,510 --> 00:36:44,130
Correct?

1038
00:36:44,130 --> 00:36:44,500
Correct.

1039
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:47,170
You need to take
responsibility for it because,

1040
00:36:47,470 --> 00:36:47,621
well,

1041
00:36:47,621 --> 00:36:48,760
who else is going to.

1042
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:49,680
Right,

1043
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:50,150
but you know,

1044
00:36:50,150 --> 00:36:52,010
as a scientist and we want to truly,

1045
00:36:52,110 --> 00:36:53,600
truly understand the phenomenon.

1046
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:57,560
We need to understand all of the causal
factors and we need to do that as

1047
00:36:57,561 --> 00:36:58,820
objectively as possible.

1048
00:36:59,330 --> 00:37:01,580
That's not saying that we're
not allowed to have compassion.

1049
00:37:01,581 --> 00:37:03,710
Like I have immense compassion want
to make the world a better place.

1050
00:37:03,711 --> 00:37:05,300
I know you want to make the
world a better place as well,

1051
00:37:05,301 --> 00:37:10,030
but I think I can like kind of separate
those things at different times and then

1052
00:37:10,031 --> 00:37:12,240
try to kind of thoughtfully think
through how we can integrate this.

1053
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:13,320
Yeah,

1054
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:14,340
I'd like to see the paper.

1055
00:37:14,341 --> 00:37:15,780
I'm very interested in what you're doing.

1056
00:37:15,810 --> 00:37:16,890
I'd like to see both of them.

1057
00:37:16,891 --> 00:37:18,090
The one on the default network.

1058
00:37:18,630 --> 00:37:18,781
Yeah,

1059
00:37:18,781 --> 00:37:21,090
and also the one on on
vulnerable narcissism.

1060
00:37:21,350 --> 00:37:23,900
I really do think that's associated
with the sorts of things that I've been

1061
00:37:23,901 --> 00:37:24,411
talking about.

1062
00:37:24,411 --> 00:37:26,510
Relationship to the school
shooters for example,

1063
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:28,730
because they develop grandiose competence,

1064
00:37:28,731 --> 00:37:29,690
suntory fantasies,

1065
00:37:29,691 --> 00:37:32,340
and then act them out the
most pathological way.

1066
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:33,413
Solely relevant.

1067
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:34,000
Yeah.

1068
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,020
Good talking with you.

1069
00:37:35,260 --> 00:37:35,710
Good talking to you.

1070
00:37:35,710 --> 00:37:36,311
Thanks for your time.

1071
00:37:36,311 --> 00:37:36,800
Yep.

1072
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:39,590
And then let me know when this goes
up and I'll tweet it and all of that.

1073
00:37:39,850 --> 00:37:40,570
Sounds good.

1074
00:37:40,570 --> 00:37:41,040
Have a good day.

1075
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:41,510
Okay.

1076
00:37:41,510 --> 00:37:42,040
Okay,

1077
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:42,640
see ya.

1078
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:42,910
Bye.
