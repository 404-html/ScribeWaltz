1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,570
How do you use the results in the new
personality test for progress in life?

2
00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:07,890
Try to compensate some sides
that that received fewer points.

3
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:09,473
Well,

4
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:12,210
at the risk of sounding self serving,

5
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:16,830
that's actually why we developed the
self authoring suite was to help people

6
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:18,030
improve their,

7
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:20,160
let's say performance and mental health.

8
00:00:20,161 --> 00:00:22,170
Now we don't have direct
evidence that will,

9
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:24,000
that will improve personality,

10
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:28,320
but I suspect that that evidence would
take a very long time to accumulate.

11
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:30,930
What we do know is that
the self authoring suite,

12
00:00:30,931 --> 00:00:32,640
especially the future authoring suite,

13
00:00:33,310 --> 00:00:34,050
um,

14
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:35,070
helps people,

15
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:36,540
helps university students,

16
00:00:36,541 --> 00:00:37,111
for example,

17
00:00:37,111 --> 00:00:38,340
stay enrolled in university.

18
00:00:38,341 --> 00:00:42,810
It increases the probability of that
by about 25% and increases grade point

19
00:00:42,811 --> 00:00:44,040
average by about the same.

20
00:00:44,041 --> 00:00:49,041
And there's good theoretical reasons for
assuming that writing is a good way of,

21
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:51,200
of um,

22
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:56,320
as writing about yourself and about your
past and about your future is a good

23
00:00:56,371 --> 00:01:00,150
way of catalyzing personality
transformation because it appears that

24
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:01,411
personality,

25
00:01:01,411 --> 00:01:04,440
the human psyche is organized at
the highest level of abstraction.

26
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:09,440
Using something like self narrative and
a well developed narrative makes a frame

27
00:01:10,381 --> 00:01:11,280
for your life and,

28
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:15,300
and helps you stabilize your negative
emotions and also experience more positive

29
00:01:15,301 --> 00:01:19,440
emotion because you only
experience positive emotion
and relationship to a goal.

30
00:01:19,441 --> 00:01:23,700
And that can make goal directed
activity lot more rewarding.

31
00:01:23,701 --> 00:01:24,060
So,

32
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:24,271
you know,

33
00:01:24,271 --> 00:01:29,271
it's a lot easier to engage in activities
that aren't intrinsically rewarding if

34
00:01:29,341 --> 00:01:31,650
they're linked to something
that you really find important.

35
00:01:31,651 --> 00:01:34,650
And so I would say if you want
to work on your personality,

36
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:37,950
well the first thing you have to do is
figure out who it is that you want to be.

37
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:42,270
And then you have to make a plan and
maybe you have to clean up your past as

38
00:01:42,271 --> 00:01:42,571
well.

39
00:01:42,571 --> 00:01:44,910
And the self authoring suite was designed,

40
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:45,661
you know,

41
00:01:45,661 --> 00:01:50,661
quite carefully in order to help people
do that with a relative minimum of

42
00:01:50,761 --> 00:01:51,210
effort.

43
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:53,070
Not that it's easy because it's not,

44
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:57,090
but a relative minimum minimum of
effort compared to other technologies,

45
00:01:57,091 --> 00:01:57,924
let's say,

46
00:01:58,260 --> 00:01:59,010
and like,

47
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:01,650
like longterm psychotherapy and,

48
00:02:01,651 --> 00:02:02,040
uh,

49
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,990
to make it cost effective as well.

50
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:04,800
So.
