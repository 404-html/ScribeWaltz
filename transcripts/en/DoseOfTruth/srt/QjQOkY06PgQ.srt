1
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:07,680
Direct stake asks,

2
00:00:07,681 --> 00:00:10,740
how do you see love arrows
in your general world view?

3
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:14,190
We're just love to come see you guys.

4
00:00:14,191 --> 00:00:16,380
See asking possibly hard questions.

5
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:21,950
Well I think that truth has to be embodied
inside love or embedded inside love.

6
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:24,383
You know,

7
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:28,560
it's not easy to figure out a hierarchy
and failures of ultimate values.

8
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:30,750
There was great,

9
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:35,400
the great traditional values of the
good and the beautiful and the true,

10
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:38,550
let's say the courageous
and that sort of thing.

11
00:00:38,551 --> 00:00:43,551
It's not easy to figure out how
you arrange those hierarchically,

12
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:48,910
but it seems to me that truth is likely
something that serves a master of one

13
00:00:50,281 --> 00:00:51,114
form or another,

14
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:52,980
at least ethical truth.

15
00:00:52,981 --> 00:00:57,981
And love is something like the decision
that being is fundamentally good or it's

16
00:00:59,371 --> 00:01:02,160
the decision to act as if
being is fundamentally good.

17
00:01:02,161 --> 00:01:04,170
That might be the right
way of thinking about it.

18
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:05,160
So you know,

19
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:08,910
I thought about this in relationship
to my son when he was little,

20
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:11,520
three years old and like unbearably cute.

21
00:01:11,521 --> 00:01:14,260
And you know what?

22
00:01:14,261 --> 00:01:14,930
Three year olds,

23
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:15,420
they're,

24
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:16,740
they're fairly easily hurt.

25
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:18,420
I mean they're quite robust in some ways,

26
00:01:18,421 --> 00:01:19,620
but they're fairly easily hurt.

27
00:01:19,621 --> 00:01:22,350
They can run out into
traffic and you know,

28
00:01:22,351 --> 00:01:26,000
they skinned their knees and
they bang heads on tables,

29
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:26,970
you know,

30
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:31,970
they're prone to emotional breakdown and
they have all these extreme fragility.

31
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:37,560
Is that make you nervous?

32
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:38,543
I would say,

33
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,740
and alert and attentive as an adult.

34
00:01:40,741 --> 00:01:44,460
But that also expose you directly to the,

35
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:47,460
to the fact of the
potential tragedy of life.

36
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:47,950
I'm not sure as,

37
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:51,810
I think one of the reasons why
having children matures you in,

38
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:53,430
in a way that nothing else can.

39
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:54,541
And you know,

40
00:01:54,541 --> 00:01:55,470
I imagined,

41
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:57,120
I've written about this in my new book,

42
00:01:57,330 --> 00:01:58,470
12 rules for life.

43
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:03,470
I imagined that I could remove his
vulnerabilities one by one so that he

44
00:02:03,811 --> 00:02:04,650
couldn't be hurt.

45
00:02:04,651 --> 00:02:05,160
And so,

46
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:05,993
you know,

47
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:06,750
I thought,

48
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:07,583
well,

49
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:09,240
I could make them into a robot.

50
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:12,960
It was 15 feet tall and
made out of metal and,

51
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:18,210
and that would remove his physical
vulnerability to have tremendous strength.

52
00:02:18,211 --> 00:02:18,871
And you know,

53
00:02:18,871 --> 00:02:23,100
you could turn them into something
like a superhero with all these,

54
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:28,170
with all these strengths instead of
these exceptional vulnerabilities.

55
00:02:28,171 --> 00:02:32,430
But what I realized very rapidly
was that every time you removed a

56
00:02:32,431 --> 00:02:33,270
vulnerability,

57
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:36,270
you removed and essential
part of the person,

58
00:02:36,271 --> 00:02:36,511
right.

59
00:02:36,511 --> 00:02:40,770
A part that you really love because
with a little three year old boy kid for

60
00:02:40,771 --> 00:02:41,604
example,

61
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:42,593
mean it's there,

62
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:43,943
it's there,

63
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:45,680
it's their fragility.

64
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:49,200
In some sense that's a huge
part of their charm and appeal.

65
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:50,790
It's not like you'd wish it on them,

66
00:02:50,791 --> 00:02:51,290
but it's,

67
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:52,200
it's part of their,

68
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:54,520
it's part of their value as being,

69
00:02:54,521 --> 00:02:57,120
and I think that reflects
something like the,

70
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:02,140
this paradoxical situation that the
Dow was referred to win when they,

71
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:03,480
in the Dell teaching,

72
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:08,530
they talk about the what makes a plot
valuable is the empty space inside it.

73
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:09,600
It's,

74
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,031
it's what,

75
00:03:10,031 --> 00:03:15,031
it's not as much as what it is that makes
it well actual first of all real but

76
00:03:16,121 --> 00:03:16,990
also useful.

77
00:03:16,991 --> 00:03:21,991
And there's something really profound
about that in the limitations.

78
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:26,260
I would say limitation is
the precondition for being,

79
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:28,390
and it's really,

80
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,001
I,

81
00:03:29,001 --> 00:03:31,620
I'd like to get this rate so that
you can follow it because it's,

82
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:35,440
it's one of the most useful thoughts
I think that has ever occurred to me.

83
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:36,910
The first is that

84
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:42,700
limits are a precondition for being
just like rules are preconditioned for a

85
00:03:42,701 --> 00:03:43,121
game.

86
00:03:43,121 --> 00:03:47,170
Like you can't play a game where
you can make any move at any time.

87
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:50,980
You have to narrow the playing
field's substantially and you have put

88
00:03:50,981 --> 00:03:55,240
restrictions on what can be done
in order for anything to be done.

89
00:03:55,750 --> 00:04:00,220
And so maybe being is this
paradoxical state where there's,

90
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:03,580
there's just enough limitation
to maximize possibility,

91
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:04,900
something like that.

92
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:08,380
And that seems right to
me why that would be.

93
00:04:08,381 --> 00:04:09,191
I have no idea.

94
00:04:09,191 --> 00:04:11,470
But maybe that's something
like an answer to why,

95
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:13,330
why there's anything,

96
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:13,661
what,

97
00:04:13,661 --> 00:04:18,590
why anything was created or I know
I'm speaking metaphysically but,

98
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:23,680
but I still think it's worthwhile
doing so and then well if,

99
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:25,030
if,

100
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:30,030
if limitation is the precondition for
being then then that that introduced the

101
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:34,000
suffering into the world and tragedy
because of course suffering and tragedy or

102
00:04:34,001 --> 00:04:35,470
consequence of limitation.

103
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:40,360
And so then the situation is that
if you want to have the being where

104
00:04:40,361 --> 00:04:42,100
possibility is maximized,

105
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:45,310
you have to accept the
limitations that produce tragedy.

106
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,030
And so that's maybe the
justification for tragedy.

107
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:51,430
Assuming that such a thing
needs to be justified.

108
00:04:51,431 --> 00:04:56,431
And then the final thought in
that three part series as well,

109
00:04:56,950 --> 00:05:01,420
maybe there's a way to live so that
the tragedy that's an intrinsic part of

110
00:05:01,421 --> 00:05:05,590
limited being becomes bearable or
becomes even something like celebrate a

111
00:05:05,591 --> 00:05:06,220
bubble.

112
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:08,080
And I guess that would be akin to niches.

113
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:09,263
Um,

114
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:11,170
wish for the eternal return,

115
00:05:11,171 --> 00:05:14,690
like he thought you should live so
that if every moment that you lived re

116
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:16,270
recurred eternally,

117
00:05:16,271 --> 00:05:17,590
that that would be a good thing.

118
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:20,080
And so it's a heroic motive being,

119
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:25,090
it's conceivable that a heroic mode
of being that requires the adoption of

120
00:05:25,091 --> 00:05:29,470
responsibility gives your life sufficient
gravitas and weight and meaning.

121
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:35,010
So that the tragedy of being can be
withstood without becoming corrupt.

122
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:38,680
And I would certainly hope
that that would be the case.

123
00:05:38,681 --> 00:05:41,650
And I think there's some reasons
to assume that it might be.
