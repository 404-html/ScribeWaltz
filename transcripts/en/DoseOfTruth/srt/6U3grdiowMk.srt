1
00:00:06,830 --> 00:00:11,000
So don't want to be a person is the
point of no return.

2
00:00:11,001 --> 00:00:12,830
Dr Peterson,
when we look at what's happening in the

3
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:15,560
US,
I don't think we're at the point of no

4
00:00:15,561 --> 00:00:17,480
return.
I don't think that things are more

5
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:21,290
fractious than they were in the 19
sixties.

6
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:23,900
You know,
there were plenty of riots in the 19

7
00:00:23,901 --> 00:00:25,820
sixties.
There was a lot of racial tension,

8
00:00:25,821 --> 00:00:30,020
there was a lot of social upheaval.
I don't even think we're at that.

9
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:33,890
I don't even think that the level of
social upheaval that we're experiencing

10
00:00:33,891 --> 00:00:37,670
right now is at that level of magnitude.
But I think it is higher than it's been

11
00:00:37,671 --> 00:00:42,671
at any point since the 19 sixties.
And I think the problem is is that the

12
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:49,780
postmodern radical types have got a
stranglehold on the administrative level

13
00:00:50,331 --> 00:00:54,830
of many institutions.
But I think what they're going to find

14
00:00:54,831 --> 00:00:58,280
is that the rug is going to be pulled
out from underneath them in ways they

15
00:00:58,281 --> 00:00:59,090
don't expect.

16
00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:02,150
So for example,
as the press has become,

17
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:06,890
let's say more ideologically
oriented,

18
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:08,930
the CBC is a good example of that.
I mean,

19
00:01:08,931 --> 00:01:11,390
I used to like the CVC,
I've been,

20
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:16,310
I was treated more unprofessionally by
the CBC,

21
00:01:16,311 --> 00:01:19,520
I would say this year.
Then by any other media organization

22
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:24,830
that I've been in contact with anywhere
in the world which is saying something

23
00:01:24,831 --> 00:01:26,900
and multiple times,
not just once.

24
00:01:27,050 --> 00:01:29,540
And I've never,
I mean I'm not complaining about that,

25
00:01:29,541 --> 00:01:33,800
I'm just pointing it out.
But what's going to happen is that as

26
00:01:33,801 --> 00:01:37,310
the media becomes more ideologically
committed,

27
00:01:37,550 --> 00:01:40,280
it's going to become irrelevant faster
and faster.

28
00:01:40,281 --> 00:01:42,950
And I think the same thing's gonna
happen with the education system,

29
00:01:42,951 --> 00:01:45,530
the public education system,
and maybe even the universities,

30
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:49,250
the harder they push in the ideological
direction,

31
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:53,420
the faster technological transformation
we'll pull the rug out from underneath

32
00:01:53,421 --> 00:01:55,430
their feet.
And I think that could happen.

33
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,200
Like I think that the,
the,

34
00:01:57,201 --> 00:02:00,350
uh,
the classic news media,

35
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:04,100
so to speak,
his dad for anyone under 40,

36
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:07,730
certainly for anyone under 30.
So.

37
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:09,770
And so that actually.
Yeah.

38
00:02:09,771 --> 00:02:12,320
Well then you can just see it.
If you pay any attention to youtube

39
00:02:12,321 --> 00:02:16,430
where you have the rise of people like
Joe Rogan who gets a one point $8,

40
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:21,140
million downloads a year and use these
long format interviews of three hours

41
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:25,220
where you can go into things in depth,
so I'm not.

42
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:30,440
I'm less worried than I was a year ago.
I would say because what I've seen

43
00:02:30,441 --> 00:02:35,441
happening is that there are many ways
that systems can be pulled out from

44
00:02:37,041 --> 00:02:40,910
underneath the people who are attempting
to manipulate them and I think that

45
00:02:40,911 --> 00:02:45,911
there's a diverse enough range of people
out there who are smart enough and fast

46
00:02:48,081 --> 00:02:53,081
enough on their feet so that
the institutions that have become

47
00:02:53,571 --> 00:02:54,860
corrupt will just die.

48
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:56,870
That's what it looks like to me.
Now.

49
00:02:57,050 --> 00:03:00,190
That doesn't mean that we're not in.
For some rocky times.

50
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:04,540
We are the shake out in the public
education system is going to be

51
00:03:04,541 --> 00:03:09,280
seriously ugly over the next five years
when as parents and teachers

52
00:03:09,281 --> 00:03:13,810
increasingly wake up to the degree that
that they ideological domination has

53
00:03:13,811 --> 00:03:17,320
occurred.
I guess what worries me is all the hr

54
00:03:17,321 --> 00:03:19,540
departments and the direction that
they're leaning,

55
00:03:19,541 --> 00:03:22,820
and even at our event,
some people have brought their syllabus

56
00:03:22,821 --> 00:03:26,110
as in just show me they read,
always studying and I was reading them.

57
00:03:26,111 --> 00:03:29,610
First of all,
these syllabuses are pages long A.

58
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:34,120
I remember mine were only like a page
long or two and it was just all sorts of

59
00:03:34,121 --> 00:03:39,121
things like queer theory and radical
black feminist theory and this and that,

60
00:03:39,771 --> 00:03:43,000
and when they graduate they're going to
be teachers.

61
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:45,100
Yeah.
Well the problem with those sorts of

62
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:50,140
approaches is that they're actually not
good for anything and so I think that if

63
00:03:50,141 --> 00:03:54,160
you're marketing education that doesn't
educate,

64
00:03:54,490 --> 00:03:59,490
that people will stop buying it a lot
faster than you think the universities

65
00:04:00,431 --> 00:04:04,150
are still running on there previously
established reputation,

66
00:04:04,151 --> 00:04:07,270
but they're making so many mistakes
right now that I think they're right

67
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:11,050
for,
for painful transition.

68
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:15,880
I mean there's already speculation in
the US that thousands of universities

69
00:04:15,881 --> 00:04:18,450
and colleges are going to go bankrupt
over the next 10 years.

70
00:04:18,451 --> 00:04:18,520
Okay.
