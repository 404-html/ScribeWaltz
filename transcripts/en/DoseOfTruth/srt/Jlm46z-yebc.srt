1
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:10,350
Oh sent and called Joseph
because he had talked to his,

2
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:14,760
his Butler and they brought him hastily
out of the Dungeon and Joseph shaved

3
00:00:14,761 --> 00:00:17,820
himself and changed his clothes
and came in unto Pharaoh.

4
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:22,110
I guess he didn't want to shock pharaoh
with how people dressed in the prison.

5
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:24,000
And Pharaoh said Unto Joseph,

6
00:00:24,001 --> 00:00:26,280
I've dreamed a dream and there
is none that can interpret it.

7
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:29,160
And I've heard say if d that you can
understand the dream to interpret it.

8
00:00:29,161 --> 00:00:29,994
And Joseph said,

9
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:30,990
it's not me.

10
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:31,860
Ah,

11
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:34,770
God will give Pharaoh and answer of peace.

12
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:39,420
It's so Jacob isn't taking credit
for his ability to interpret dreams,

13
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:41,490
which also indicates quite interestingly,

14
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:42,090
there's,

15
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:46,050
there's nothing that despite the fact
that he's successful and competent,

16
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:47,430
he's not narcissistic.

17
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:49,320
Like if he happens to have this gift,

18
00:00:49,321 --> 00:00:52,410
he regards it as a gift
and not as something that,

19
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:53,130
you know,

20
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:54,390
redounds his favor.

21
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:56,490
It's just something that he
happens to be able to do.

22
00:00:56,910 --> 00:00:57,510
And so that's,

23
00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:01,680
that's a hallmark of someone who's got a
pretty well put together personality as

24
00:01:01,681 --> 00:01:04,140
far as I'm concerned because you know,

25
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:07,800
people have gifts that
they didn't really earn.

26
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:08,970
Those would be your talents,

27
00:01:08,971 --> 00:01:09,751
your intelligence,

28
00:01:09,751 --> 00:01:12,090
your good looks if you
happen to have good looks,

29
00:01:12,091 --> 00:01:12,924
et Cetera,

30
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:14,720
and they're not,

31
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:17,830
there's no sense being all puffed
up about that because it's,

32
00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:18,741
it's great.

33
00:01:18,741 --> 00:01:23,060
It's luck of the draw though and the
proper attitude is to note that it's luck

34
00:01:23,061 --> 00:01:24,470
of the draw and to be grateful for it.

35
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:28,463
Yeah,

36
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:32,180
it's quite a fine painting.

37
00:01:32,181 --> 00:01:33,014
That one

38
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:38,420
hold their come seven years of great,

39
00:01:38,421 --> 00:01:41,720
plenty throughout the land of Egypt and
then there shall arise after them seven

40
00:01:41,721 --> 00:01:44,780
years of famine and all the Plenti
shall be forgotten and the famine shall

41
00:01:44,781 --> 00:01:48,170
consume the land and the Plenti
shall not be known in the land.

42
00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:51,080
I reason of that famine
following sh fort Shelby,

43
00:01:51,081 --> 00:01:51,920
very grievous.

44
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:56,320
So now we see to that Jacob,

45
00:01:56,370 --> 00:01:57,420
he can interpret dreams,

46
00:01:57,421 --> 00:02:01,230
but he's also the sort of person who can
look into the future and think this is

47
00:02:01,231 --> 00:02:05,850
sort of what Adam was called on to do
when he got kicked out of the garden of

48
00:02:05,851 --> 00:02:09,480
Paradise is you're going to be able to
conceptualize that even if things are

49
00:02:09,481 --> 00:02:10,560
going well now,

50
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:13,500
that that doesn't mean that they're
going to go well into the future.

51
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:17,070
And so he's the aunt
and not the grasshopper,

52
00:02:17,071 --> 00:02:19,020
right in the grasshopper
and the ants story,

53
00:02:19,021 --> 00:02:20,310
it's like everything's good,

54
00:02:20,311 --> 00:02:24,450
but you should wake the hell up and you
should test to see how things can go

55
00:02:24,451 --> 00:02:28,640
wrong and you can see if your
systems can survive them.

56
00:02:28,641 --> 00:02:33,641
Things going wrong and which is something
that I think we could all Harken to

57
00:02:33,891 --> 00:02:37,310
because I think we do a very bad job in
the modern world of testing to see if

58
00:02:37,311 --> 00:02:38,540
our systems can go wrong.
