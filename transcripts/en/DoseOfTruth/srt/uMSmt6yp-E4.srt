1
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:08,820
Last question.

2
00:00:09,770 --> 00:00:10,603
Okay.

3
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:12,361
Thanks.

4
00:00:12,361 --> 00:00:14,070
Also for continuing the electric series.

5
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:16,590
I haven't listened to all of the lectures,

6
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:21,540
but it seems like you focus very much
on the appeal of the biblical stories to

7
00:00:21,541 --> 00:00:23,040
the individual psychology.

8
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:27,870
Do you have any thoughts on the relative
importance of crowd psychology to the

9
00:00:27,871 --> 00:00:28,060
uh,

10
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:28,890
appeal instinct?

11
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:29,120
However,

12
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:30,260
the Bible and also the,

13
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:34,920
the reason why the Bible or the biblical
stories took precedence over other,

14
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:36,210
um,

15
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:38,550
ideologies which could
have taken its place.

16
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:39,801
Okay.

17
00:00:39,801 --> 00:00:39,951
Well,

18
00:00:39,951 --> 00:00:41,870
let's go to the second one first.

19
00:00:48,130 --> 00:00:51,490
I think it's the same thing
that happens when someone,

20
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:52,780
okay.

21
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:54,370
Both creates an edits,

22
00:00:54,371 --> 00:00:55,480
a great movie.

23
00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:57,440
Okay.

24
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,120
It's no one knows,

25
00:00:59,170 --> 00:00:59,390
like,

26
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:01,580
imagine how many choices are
they're in a great movie.

27
00:01:01,581 --> 00:01:04,850
Let's say it's an animated movie because
absolutely everything in an animated

28
00:01:04,851 --> 00:01:05,990
movie is constructed.

29
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:06,853
Everything.

30
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:07,701
There's,

31
00:01:07,701 --> 00:01:09,410
God only knows how many choices.

32
00:01:09,411 --> 00:01:11,930
Like maybe there's millions of choices,

33
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:12,741
you know,

34
00:01:12,741 --> 00:01:17,741
and each choice is guided by
some intuition of narrative
suitability or beauty

35
00:01:19,611 --> 00:01:22,400
or there's some higher
ideal motivating it,

36
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:23,330
right?

37
00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:24,950
The desire to produce a masterpiece.

38
00:01:24,951 --> 00:01:25,900
Maybe that's it.

39
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:27,770
That was certainly the case
with the Disney movies,

40
00:01:27,771 --> 00:01:28,604
for example.

41
00:01:28,730 --> 00:01:33,730
And so that that aspiration
then then makes the decisions.

42
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:35,810
And so I would say,

43
00:01:35,811 --> 00:01:40,811
well something like that
guided the writing and the
selection of the stories in,

44
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:43,730
in the biblical Canon now

45
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:48,240
could have there been other stories
included while the Catholics and the

46
00:01:48,241 --> 00:01:51,570
Protestants don't have the same biblical
tradition and neither do the Jews and

47
00:01:51,571 --> 00:01:52,231
the Christians.

48
00:01:52,231 --> 00:01:56,010
And so it isn't exactly
clear what to make of that,

49
00:01:56,011 --> 00:01:56,610
you know,

50
00:01:56,610 --> 00:02:00,900
I mean that's a can in some sense to the
discussion we just had about Islam and

51
00:02:00,901 --> 00:02:01,734
Christianity.

52
00:02:02,050 --> 00:02:02,883
Um,

53
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:08,100
in some sense I've left that aside,

54
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:13,020
that specific question except in so far
as I've just answered because I'm trying

55
00:02:13,021 --> 00:02:14,460
to take what we have,

56
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:18,300
which I know is that the root of our
culture and to figure out what it is that

57
00:02:18,301 --> 00:02:19,134
we have,

58
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:21,090
why it is that we have it.

59
00:02:21,091 --> 00:02:21,924
Yeah.

60
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:23,220
Okay.

61
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:27,570
Well I've made some attempt to explain
that in the manner that I just described,

62
00:02:27,571 --> 00:02:29,610
but I don't have a final answer.

63
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,320
Like could it have been different?

64
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:36,070
It could have been
different at some levels,

65
00:02:36,071 --> 00:02:37,180
but the same at others.

66
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:38,051
You know,

67
00:02:38,051 --> 00:02:38,291
I mean,

68
00:02:38,291 --> 00:02:42,640
one of the things that's the scholars
of comparative religion who haven't been

69
00:02:42,641 --> 00:02:47,110
infected fatally with postmodernism
have definitely realized so young,

70
00:02:47,111 --> 00:02:47,801
for example,

71
00:02:47,801 --> 00:02:50,980
in Elliott and people who are
interested in grand narratives,

72
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,580
one of the things they pointed
out quite clearly is that there's,

73
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:55,090
there's,

74
00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:58,810
there's a set of common
mythological themes across many,

75
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:01,120
and I tried to outline
that in maps of meaning.

76
00:03:01,121 --> 00:03:05,170
And that worked out quite nicely for
me at least as far as I was concerned

77
00:03:05,171 --> 00:03:07,930
because once I had the basic
archetipal structure mapped out,

78
00:03:07,931 --> 00:03:11,170
it opened up all sorts of stories to me
from all sorts of different cultures.

79
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:13,750
And that's been unbelievably useful.

80
00:03:13,751 --> 00:03:15,850
Like the Mesopotamian story of it,

81
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:16,910
the Enuma Elish when,

82
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:19,600
when I figured out what that
meant as far as I was concerned,

83
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,430
like I've never forgotten that.

84
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:23,980
It just seared itself into my memory.

85
00:03:23,981 --> 00:03:26,830
And the same with the
Egyptian stories and you know,

86
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:28,120
some Buddhist writing said,

87
00:03:28,121 --> 00:03:28,960
I've read it in some,

88
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:31,540
the Tao Te Ching is also very powerful.

89
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:35,760
So I think that things can be different
on one level and that same metta

90
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:36,370
another,

91
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:41,370
but that humanity kind of coalesces on
what's the same over a reasonable period

92
00:03:41,561 --> 00:03:45,580
of time because there isn't that many
ways that human beings can live properly

93
00:03:45,581 --> 00:03:48,820
as individuals and as groups together.

94
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:53,740
And so there's this constant force
that makes our ethical presuppositions

95
00:03:53,741 --> 00:03:57,340
converge and then that's automatically
expressed in the stories.

96
00:03:57,910 --> 00:03:59,290
It's something like that now.

97
00:03:59,291 --> 00:04:01,840
It's an imperfect process
and it's full of error.

98
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:03,153
So.

99
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:05,823
Yup.

100
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:09,320
[inaudible]

101
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,193
so

102
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:14,630
one announcement,

103
00:04:14,770 --> 00:04:15,140
uh,

104
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:16,400
well two announcements.

105
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:18,830
The next lecture I
believe is November 14th,

106
00:04:18,831 --> 00:04:21,260
so I'll hopefully finish
off the story of Jacob,

107
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,153
looks like it.

108
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:27,520
And then I'm also appearing on a panel
with Gad Saad and or an amateur Jay on

109
00:04:28,251 --> 00:04:32,240
November 11th and there's still quite
a few tickets available for that.

110
00:04:32,241 --> 00:04:33,260
So if you're interested,

111
00:04:33,261 --> 00:04:35,550
you could go to my website
and pick up those tickets.

112
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,033
It should be,

113
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:37,731
well,

114
00:04:37,731 --> 00:04:38,990
hopefully it'll be interesting.

115
00:04:38,991 --> 00:04:41,720
I think it will be and it
might be too interesting.

116
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:43,640
That's one possibility.

117
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:45,740
So we'll see.

118
00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:48,350
But I'm going to do two
more of these this year,

119
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:52,700
and I hope I get through the story of
Joseph and then I can start in the new

120
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:53,930
year with the exodus.

121
00:04:53,931 --> 00:04:56,000
And that's a story that I know quite well.

122
00:04:56,001 --> 00:04:58,190
And the exodus and Leviticus.

123
00:04:58,191 --> 00:04:59,620
And what's the one after that?

124
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:00,830
You,

125
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:01,220
yes.

126
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:01,790
Thank you.

127
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:02,450
Um,

128
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:05,810
so I'm very much looking forward to
that because that is one killer story

129
00:05:05,811 --> 00:05:06,111
mountain,

130
00:05:06,111 --> 00:05:06,860
so,

131
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:09,590
and I've got some
surprises for that as well.

132
00:05:09,591 --> 00:05:10,424
So anyway,

133
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,350
so thank you very much for coming.

134
00:05:12,351 --> 00:05:12,711
And,

135
00:05:12,711 --> 00:05:12,980
uh,

136
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:14,520
hopefully we'll see you November for

137
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:14,950
14.
