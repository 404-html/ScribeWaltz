1
00:00:06,670 --> 00:00:11,140
There are a variety of very complex
things facing us and one of them is

2
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:13,630
called the Iq issue that we talked
about.

3
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:17,350
Another is this polarization between
left and right.

4
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:19,810
That seems to be characterizing
everywhere in the West,

5
00:00:19,811 --> 00:00:21,250
you know,
it's the same in Australia,

6
00:00:21,251 --> 00:00:22,870
New Zealand,
all through Europe,

7
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:24,670
in Canada,
in the US.

8
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:28,420
I think you guys are actually a little
more protected against the most places.

9
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,720
But um,
and then the other one is,

10
00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:36,460
well we need a dialogue between Islam
and Christianity and Judaism for that

11
00:00:36,461 --> 00:00:37,420
matter.
But I mean the big,

12
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:41,500
the big clash for,
for the Western world is,

13
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:45,160
is Islam versus Christianity and you
know,

14
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:49,450
people don't think about it in those
terms because many intellectuals in the

15
00:00:49,451 --> 00:00:53,230
west think of themselves as secular,
but it's a massive,

16
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:57,700
it's a massive problem.
And I'm hoping to conduct a whole series

17
00:00:57,701 --> 00:01:00,220
of conversations with,
with Muslims,

18
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:05,730
a former and present pro and anti to try
to facilitate a dialogue because there's

19
00:01:07,421 --> 00:01:08,440
lots to talk about.

20
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:12,220
I mean,
I've studied religious thinking a lot

21
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:16,420
and I'm pretty ignorant about Islam
because it's complicated system and it's

22
00:01:16,421 --> 00:01:20,680
difficult to get into.
But I can tell you that what I've read

23
00:01:20,681 --> 00:01:25,681
about Islam has not made me feel better
about the chances of reconciliation

24
00:01:27,821 --> 00:01:29,710
between the Christian and the Islamic
world.

25
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,380
So like I don't know what to make of the
fact,

26
00:01:32,381 --> 00:01:35,410
for example,
I mean if you look at the figure of

27
00:01:35,411 --> 00:01:38,230
Christ and I don't care if you're
religious or not,

28
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:40,400
and I don't even care a Christ existed
or not,

29
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:45,420
and I certainly don't care at the moment
about claims to divinity or the lock

30
00:01:45,821 --> 00:01:48,010
there up.
I'm just speaking as let's say I'm

31
00:01:48,011 --> 00:01:51,940
speaking as a secondary intellectual
mean as a figure.

32
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:56,800
He's a figure of peace.
I don't think that that's disputable.

33
00:01:57,580 --> 00:01:58,450
I mean,
he certainly,

34
00:01:58,570 --> 00:02:01,390
he wasn't a war Lord.
That's one thing.

35
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:04,720
That's for certain he never led armies,
you know,

36
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:07,330
whereas that's not the case with
Mohammed at all.

37
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:11,110
Muhammad was clearly and indisputably a
war Lord.

38
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:16,710
And so it isn't the obvious to me what
to make of that except that it's bloody

39
00:02:16,721 --> 00:02:19,390
complicated.
Had a child bride as well,

40
00:02:19,570 --> 00:02:20,920
I believe.
Yeah.

41
00:02:20,921 --> 00:02:24,640
Well,
that one is somewhat less problematic to

42
00:02:24,641 --> 00:02:29,641
me because I think that you can write
that off to the cultural mores of the

43
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:32,210
time.
Now I'm.

44
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:36,850
I know that there's a weakness in that,
but I don't think we have to address

45
00:02:36,851 --> 00:02:38,940
that,
but the wind,

46
00:02:38,941 --> 00:02:43,840
the founder of your religion spread that
religion by the sword.

47
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:48,250
It makes it rather difficult and when
your religion has been embroiled in a

48
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:51,700
vicious civil war from the day of
Mohammed's death,

49
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:55,000
which is exactly the case in Islam
between the Sudanese and the and the

50
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:57,760
Shiites,
that war started literally the day that

51
00:02:57,761 --> 00:03:00,880
Mohammed died.
It's very difficult for me to see how

52
00:03:00,881 --> 00:03:04,900
that could be reconciled with the claims
that Islam is a religion of peace.

53
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:07,420
Yeah.
We solved that one when Martin Luther

54
00:03:07,421 --> 00:03:10,600
hammered some stuff on a door a long
time ago and the Protestants and the

55
00:03:10,601 --> 00:03:14,140
Catholics just went their separate ways
and I mean there's been some rough

56
00:03:14,141 --> 00:03:19,120
feelings over the years I suppose,
but no generational wars that I can

57
00:03:19,121 --> 00:03:20,650
think of.
I mean,

58
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:21,663
right.

59
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:22,651
Yeah.
Well,

60
00:03:22,651 --> 00:03:23,890
I mean there was plenty,
you know,

61
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:24,733
as you said,
there were.

62
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:28,950
There's been plenty of Christian schism,
but the other thing too is that it's not

63
00:03:28,951 --> 00:03:31,770
that easy to lay those at the feet of
Christ.

64
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:35,520
No,
because because just even merely as an

65
00:03:35,521 --> 00:03:36,840
archetypal figure,
you know,

66
00:03:36,841 --> 00:03:37,231
as,
as,

67
00:03:37,231 --> 00:03:40,890
as,
as the western world's hypothesis of the

68
00:03:40,891 --> 00:03:42,420
ideal man.
I mean,

69
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:47,630
as a moral character,
he was pretty much above reproach and I

70
00:03:47,881 --> 00:03:49,260
don't.
Well,

71
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:54,570
it's difficult for me to say the same
thing about Muhammad now.

72
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:59,190
That might be because I'm an ignorant
all western white guy,

73
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:03,930
but like I'm doing my best man.
I'm a big buyer of Taoism for example,

74
00:04:03,931 --> 00:04:08,870
and there's great wisdom in Taoism and
I've found value real value in,

75
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:11,190
in so much of the religious reading that
I,

76
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:14,520
that I've done,
but I'm really stumbling with Islam.

77
00:04:14,521 --> 00:04:19,521
It's really hard for me to,
to see it as other than a primarily

78
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:23,010
political system

79
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:27,870
and did.
And that's how it's being imply enforced

80
00:04:27,871 --> 00:04:30,150
right now with wwe,
that's what Isis is all about.

81
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:32,640
Their estate establish a religious
caliphate,

82
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:34,620
you know,
across the borders of two,

83
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:35,550
two countries.
It's,

84
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:38,820
it's less about.
When I think of religion,

85
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,480
when I think of the Christian religion
and how it's applied here in my home

86
00:04:42,481 --> 00:04:43,560
state of Georgia,
you know,

87
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:45,380
it's when,
when,

88
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:49,470
when we go to church and we tie,
that has very little to do with politics

89
00:04:49,471 --> 00:04:50,420
at all.
There's,

90
00:04:50,421 --> 00:04:51,330
there's,
there's this huge,

91
00:04:51,331 --> 00:04:54,340
massive separation between religion and
politics for the most part in the US and

92
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:56,700
to be,
there are moments of ambiguity and,

93
00:04:56,860 --> 00:05:00,180
and tempers flare over and I'm a
monument on this piece of property or

94
00:05:00,181 --> 00:05:02,130
no,
but that's as stiff as it gets.

95
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,620
Like,
like the scariest bit of that that I can

96
00:05:04,621 --> 00:05:07,470
remember.
Some drunk fellow ran over a monument or

97
00:05:07,471 --> 00:05:09,780
the 10 commandments a few months ago and
tipped it over.

98
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:10,470
Like,
like,

99
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:11,750
like that's what happens when

100
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:16,020
I agree to your point,
like if you're not a Christian Kyle and

101
00:05:16,021 --> 00:05:16,950
you're,
you know,

102
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:20,520
Christian kind of alcove there in
Georgia,

103
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:23,250
no one ever is going to come to you and
say you have to pay a different rate of

104
00:05:23,251 --> 00:05:25,260
taxes.
You have to go to different stores.

105
00:05:25,261 --> 00:05:27,780
You have the religious law will not be
enforced

106
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,350
as a law.
You know,

107
00:05:29,351 --> 00:05:30,660
I'm not gonna lose any hands.
Uh,

108
00:05:30,661 --> 00:05:31,494
if I,
if I,

109
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:33,070
I can,
you know,

110
00:05:33,071 --> 00:05:37,630
the Bible has many restrictions that it
places on Christians and I ignore all of

111
00:05:37,631 --> 00:05:38,770
them virtually,
you know,

112
00:05:38,771 --> 00:05:40,320
like,
but I don't,

113
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:42,700
I know there's no,
like there's no

114
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:48,690
religious police to come and kick my
door in and drag me away and torture me

115
00:05:48,691 --> 00:05:50,490
and threatened my family and,
and.

116
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:51,573
Well,
let me,

117
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:53,140
it's also,
there's other,

118
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:58,200
there's other cataclysms that are on the
that exist on the conceptual,

119
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:01,820
the conceptual realm as well.
So you know,

120
00:06:01,821 --> 00:06:03,140
the,
the,

121
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:08,470
the state's dominated by Islam are not
economically productive and that's quite

122
00:06:09,891 --> 00:06:14,891
an interesting mystery and
they're not.

123
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:20,100
And many of the many of the Islamic
states that we purport to regard as

124
00:06:20,101 --> 00:06:25,101
allies hold values that are antithetical
to our system and a,

125
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:27,900
Saudi Arabia is a classic example of
that.

126
00:06:27,901 --> 00:06:30,870
And I cannot for the life of me
understand,

127
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:37,390
except in a psychoanalytic matter why
the radical feminists tolerate America's

128
00:06:39,010 --> 00:06:41,770
ally.
America's lie.

129
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:44,000
The fact that America is allied with the
Saudis,

130
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:45,570
it's just absolute.
It's like,

131
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:50,720
it's like it's not much different as far
as I'm concerned that it would be if

132
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:54,830
black people didn't say anything.
If America was allied with a slave

133
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:59,420
owning a black slave owning state,
which of course also happens in Saudi

134
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:00,640
Arabia by the way,
and not

135
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:04,330
so when did the feminist.
It's gotta be because Muslims right now

136
00:07:04,331 --> 00:07:06,730
are higher up on the victim hierarchy
than then,

137
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:10,350
so even if it's way over there,
they're not allowed to speak out against

138
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:10,680
them.

139
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:14,820
I think it's their unconscious wish for
brutal male domination.

140
00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:18,410
No,
I like that.

141
00:07:18,411 --> 00:07:21,800
That's fun.
I think it's the left's ability to

142
00:07:21,801 --> 00:07:26,270
apologize for anything that's wrong.
I think the people on the left,

143
00:07:26,271 --> 00:07:29,120
and maybe I'm just as crazy as you guys
are,

144
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,940
like I said,
the Muslims are oppressed women.

145
00:07:31,941 --> 00:07:32,810
Oh,
that's cultural.

146
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:35,900
We need to understand that.
Oh guys think they're girls that you

147
00:07:35,901 --> 00:07:36,350
know,
hey,

148
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:38,180
we need to understand where they're
coming from.

149
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:41,540
Everything.
They're so open minded to it,

150
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:42,890
even if it's horrific.
Yeah.

151
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:46,260
That's also the agreeableness say that
we were talking about earlier.

152
00:07:46,261 --> 00:07:47,840
Yeah,
because agree,

153
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:50,300
agreeable people agree,
you know,

154
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:55,570
that's why the term exists and yeah,
so there is a real apology and if you

155
00:07:55,990 --> 00:07:59,220
ally that with high openness,
which is that open mindedness,

156
00:07:59,221 --> 00:08:01,170
you know,
that that's associated activity,

157
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:04,470
you get agreeable openness and yeah,
that's definitely.

158
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:09,770
And then it even goes,
I'll call and I'll forgive you beating

159
00:08:09,771 --> 00:08:12,800
your wife and if you're low in
conscientiousness,

160
00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:17,570
everything keeping really goes.
Then Bill Moore puts it nicely when he

161
00:08:17,571 --> 00:08:18,170
says,
you know,

162
00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:23,170
the lift would not for one second be
okay with apartheid in South Africa,

163
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:25,190
right?
They were just banging that drum hating

164
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:29,270
every second of the way,
but for some reason the oppression of

165
00:08:29,271 --> 00:08:32,030
women in Saudi Arabia has gotten a
complete pass.

166
00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:35,660
Yup.
And it's a real deal.

167
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:36,553
You know,
what

168
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,820
the heck?
Just the driving thing alone.

169
00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:46,860
Taylor,
can you hold it that they liked her?

170
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:48,860
Yeah,
I broke up.

171
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:50,480
You broke that.
We couldn't hear what you were saying

172
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:52,400
that you're still a little frozen.
So,

173
00:08:52,401 --> 00:08:53,234
um,
uh,

174
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:54,740
but yeah,
just taking away their ability to drive.

175
00:08:54,741 --> 00:08:56,700
Right?
Women don't have mobility without men.

176
00:08:56,970 --> 00:09:00,660
That is hugely oppressive.
If you made that change in America and

177
00:09:00,661 --> 00:09:04,070
none other than our wellness stuff,
dude,

178
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:09,540
you actually don't see a more concrete
embodiment of the idea of individual

179
00:09:10,211 --> 00:09:13,300
autonomy than the automobile.
You know,

180
00:09:13,301 --> 00:09:16,900
I think maybe it was the Soviet Union's
import and then,

181
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:17,990
and then,
uh,

182
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:20,830
a manufacturer if the automobile,
the doom,

183
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:25,840
communism because nothing screams
autonomous individual like a car,

184
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:28,630
right?
You will derive it yourself.

185
00:09:28,631 --> 00:09:31,120
You can go on any road.
No one tells you what to do.

186
00:09:31,121 --> 00:09:35,440
It's like it's freedom.
And the fact that women can't drive in

187
00:09:35,441 --> 00:09:37,540
Saudi Arabia,
it tells the entire story.

188
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:42,780
And so the fact I cannot understand for
the life of me why we are so blind in

189
00:09:43,601 --> 00:09:45,790
the west,
that we make the assumption that those

190
00:09:45,791 --> 00:09:49,390
people are our allies.
Like in what way?
