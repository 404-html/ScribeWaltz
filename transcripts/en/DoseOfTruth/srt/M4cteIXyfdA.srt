1
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:07,861
Yeah,

2
00:00:07,861 --> 00:00:10,050
well I was also really
interested at the time,

3
00:00:10,051 --> 00:00:10,321
man,

4
00:00:10,321 --> 00:00:13,050
now in the biological basis of behavior.

5
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:13,381
Right.

6
00:00:13,381 --> 00:00:13,831
And so,

7
00:00:13,831 --> 00:00:14,040
and,

8
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:14,880
and in the,

9
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:15,990
uh,

10
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:19,860
in the relationship between fundamental
motivational systems and thought because

11
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:24,660
obviously our thought is grounded in
fundamental motivational systems and your

12
00:00:24,661 --> 00:00:27,690
work on disgust with maybe you can
tell the viewers a little bit about,

13
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:31,980
was really interesting to me because it
was an emotional system that hadn't been

14
00:00:31,981 --> 00:00:32,731
studied much.

15
00:00:32,731 --> 00:00:32,971
I mean,

16
00:00:32,971 --> 00:00:34,800
you were really one of
the pioneers in the,

17
00:00:34,801 --> 00:00:36,600
in the psychological study of disgust.

18
00:00:36,830 --> 00:00:36,970
Well,

19
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:38,710
the way to explain it is that Paul Rosin,

20
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:42,310
my advisor at Penn is the
pioneer in this study of disgust.

21
00:00:42,311 --> 00:00:45,610
And he'd studied it as a food related
emotion and he'd written a bit about it

22
00:00:45,611 --> 00:00:46,690
being a moral emotion.

23
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:52,170
And I was a graduate student at Penn and
I was interested in morality and I was

24
00:00:52,361 --> 00:00:55,270
reading the Bible and I was reading,

25
00:00:55,310 --> 00:00:55,860
um,

26
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:56,020
uh,

27
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:59,170
anthropological accounts of different
countries and different cultures.

28
00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:03,280
And at the time morality was
all about reasoning about harm,

29
00:01:03,281 --> 00:01:04,240
rights and justice.

30
00:01:04,450 --> 00:01:06,910
So Lawrence Kohlberg was the
leading figure in the field.

31
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:10,150
And because I was looking
at morality across cultures,

32
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:11,433
uh,

33
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:12,670
and when you look across cultures,

34
00:01:12,671 --> 00:01:15,190
it's not just about
fairness and Harmon rights,

35
00:01:15,191 --> 00:01:19,730
it's about menstruation and
food taboos and skin lesions.

36
00:01:19,731 --> 00:01:20,890
And it's very physical.

37
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:21,521
And I was,

38
00:01:21,521 --> 00:01:21,761
you know,

39
00:01:21,761 --> 00:01:22,540
why?

40
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:24,580
Why does so many societies,

41
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:28,630
why is it like the normal default way of
being is to somehow bring the body into

42
00:01:28,631 --> 00:01:29,020
morality?

43
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:29,853
Why is that?

44
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:33,970
And so I just happened to be at Penn where
the world's expert in disgust was and

45
00:01:33,971 --> 00:01:37,360
I went to talk to them and that started
one of the best collaborations of my

46
00:01:37,361 --> 00:01:38,194
life.

47
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:40,600
And what it led to is,

48
00:01:40,601 --> 00:01:42,220
is a broadening of the,

49
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:43,061
of the moral domain.

50
00:01:43,061 --> 00:01:48,061
Basically there's a sort of a western
secular approach that you see in western

51
00:01:48,431 --> 00:01:49,264
philosophers.

52
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:49,980
I have,

53
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:54,670
their morality is about
harm and utilitarianism and
let's minimize harm or it's

54
00:01:54,671 --> 00:01:56,530
about rights and principles,

55
00:01:56,531 --> 00:01:56,711
you know,

56
00:01:56,711 --> 00:02:01,600
manual con and a much better way
psychologically I think about morality is

57
00:02:01,601 --> 00:02:02,381
virtue ethics.

58
00:02:02,381 --> 00:02:03,640
It's just a lot of stuff.

59
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:05,890
It's just we have just a lot
of stuff that we judge on.

60
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:10,960
And this led me eventually to realize
that people on the left and people on the

61
00:02:10,961 --> 00:02:12,970
right care about different stuff.

62
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:15,820
Everybody cares about harm and fairness,

63
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:19,900
but the stuff about keeping your
boundaries around the group,

64
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:20,771
it'll to wall,

65
00:02:20,771 --> 00:02:21,970
protect the group,

66
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:23,470
hold the group together,

67
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:24,550
hate traders.

68
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:25,151
Um,

69
00:02:25,151 --> 00:02:25,361
you know,

70
00:02:25,361 --> 00:02:26,470
everybody can do that.

71
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:27,461
But right.

72
00:02:27,461 --> 00:02:32,461
We morality built on these additional
additional foundations of these additional

73
00:02:32,561 --> 00:02:33,730
emotions and foundations.

74
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:34,510
Um,

75
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:37,360
so that work on discussed that I was
just beginning to talk about them when we

76
00:02:37,361 --> 00:02:42,250
first met in 1994 led eventually to what
we now call moral foundations theory

77
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:46,150
and with might with that five or six
colleagues that if you go to your

78
00:02:46,151 --> 00:02:47,080
morals.org,

79
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:47,560
uh,

80
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,760
you can take our test,

81
00:02:48,761 --> 00:02:49,630
you can learn all about it.

82
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:50,650
Um,

83
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:53,410
but it led to the perspective
that ultimately was,

84
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:57,850
I think the right perspective
as the cultural war was
heating up and as left and

85
00:02:57,851 --> 00:02:58,540
right,

86
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:00,940
we're essentially becoming
like different countries,

87
00:03:00,941 --> 00:03:01,690
different cultures.
