1
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:03,793
Uh,

2
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:11,550
that's exactly the
symbolism of the great side.

3
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:13,540
All hierarchy to,

4
00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:14,470
to power.

5
00:00:14,471 --> 00:00:15,100
Okay.

6
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:16,480
And selfish power.

7
00:00:16,481 --> 00:00:16,820
Okay.

8
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:18,520
Is it is utterly naive.

9
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:19,390
It's ignorant,

10
00:00:19,391 --> 00:00:19,660
right?

11
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:23,610
So I say education has to
be totally reconstituted it,

12
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:27,550
including public education to be getting
the most distant path so that show our

13
00:00:27,551 --> 00:00:30,040
young people today who
know nothing about how the,

14
00:00:30,041 --> 00:00:31,780
how the world was created
that they inhabit.

15
00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:32,220
Okay.

16
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:33,190
Because understand,

17
00:00:33,191 --> 00:00:33,470
okay,

18
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:37,360
what marvelous paradise they live in.

19
00:00:37,450 --> 00:00:39,850
And it's the product of capitalism is
the product we're probably going to

20
00:00:39,851 --> 00:00:42,100
individual innovation is the most of,

21
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:42,810
is the product of a,

22
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:45,070
of a Western tradition that
everyone wants to trash.

23
00:00:45,071 --> 00:00:45,880
Now is there,

24
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:50,020
if you'd be good in the past and show
it off to talk about war and because the

25
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:52,000
war is the one thing that wakes people up.

26
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:52,241
Okay.

27
00:00:52,241 --> 00:00:53,074
As we see right?

28
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:53,933
Wars.

29
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:55,620
Yes.

30
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:56,040
Okay.

31
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:56,491
Wars.

32
00:00:56,491 --> 00:00:57,330
The reality principle.

33
00:00:57,331 --> 00:00:57,691
My,

34
00:00:57,691 --> 00:01:00,870
I'm father and all five of my
uncles went to World War II.

35
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:01,210
You know,

36
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:01,780
in my,

37
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:01,981
you know,

38
00:01:01,981 --> 00:01:03,700
my father was w was part of the,

39
00:01:03,701 --> 00:01:05,400
the force that have landed in Japan.

40
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:05,930
Okay.

41
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:06,250
Uh,

42
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:06,570
it's,

43
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:06,750
you know,

44
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:07,060
it has him,

45
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:07,950
he was a paratrooper.

46
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:08,760
Um,

47
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:08,971
you know,

48
00:01:08,971 --> 00:01:09,131
at the,

49
00:01:09,131 --> 00:01:10,770
at the time of the Japanese surrender.

50
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:11,200
Okay.

51
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:11,790
And,

52
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:12,200
and,

53
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:14,550
and a couple of uncles
got shot up and so on.

54
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:16,080
When you have the reality of war,

55
00:01:16,081 --> 00:01:18,930
when people see the reality
of the horrors of war,

56
00:01:18,931 --> 00:01:22,950
Berlin burned to a crisp
and and so on or you,

57
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:23,910
your starvation.

58
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:24,360
Okay.

59
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:25,500
Then you understand,

60
00:01:25,501 --> 00:01:25,760
okay,

61
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:28,020
this is marvelous mechanism
that brings water,

62
00:01:28,021 --> 00:01:28,220
you know,

63
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:28,700
to the,

64
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:29,371
to the kitchen.

65
00:01:29,371 --> 00:01:31,580
And when you do flip on a
light late in the electricity,

66
00:01:31,581 --> 00:01:32,330
the electricity,

67
00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:36,290
I know for me like I suppose it's
because I have somewhat of a depressive

68
00:01:36,291 --> 00:01:36,831
temperament.

69
00:01:36,831 --> 00:01:37,430
I mean,

70
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:41,840
one thing that staggers me on a consistent
basis is the fact that anything ever

71
00:01:41,841 --> 00:01:42,674
works.

72
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:43,041
I mean,

73
00:01:43,041 --> 00:01:44,420
because it's so unlikely,

74
00:01:44,421 --> 00:01:44,691
you know,

75
00:01:44,691 --> 00:01:44,931
to,

76
00:01:44,931 --> 00:01:45,440
to,

77
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:48,650
to be in a situation where our
electronic communications work,

78
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:49,450
where our,

79
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:52,430
where our electric grid works
and it works all the time.

80
00:01:52,431 --> 00:01:52,581
Right?

81
00:01:52,581 --> 00:01:54,290
It works 100% of the time.

82
00:01:54,291 --> 00:01:58,790
And the reason for that is that there
are mostly men out there who are breaking

83
00:01:58,791 --> 00:02:00,950
themselves into pieces
repairing this thing,

84
00:02:00,951 --> 00:02:02,780
which just falls apart all the time.

85
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:04,630
I said this in the moment

86
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:05,070
bait.

87
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:05,221
Okay?

88
00:02:05,221 --> 00:02:06,660
In Toronto several years ago,

89
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:07,561
I said that,

90
00:02:07,561 --> 00:02:07,720
and I,

91
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:09,470
this is the invisible at all these,

92
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:09,900
these,

93
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:10,260
these,

94
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:10,651
you know,

95
00:02:10,651 --> 00:02:12,470
and he's elitist professors,

96
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,890
snaring and men.

97
00:02:13,891 --> 00:02:17,250
It's men who are maintaining
everything around us or anything.

98
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,780
This is an invisible army.

99
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:19,080
Okay?

100
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:19,470
Which are you?

101
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:20,880
What your feminists don't notice,

102
00:02:20,881 --> 00:02:21,330
right?

103
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:22,163
Nothing would work

104
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:23,870
or regarded regardless.

105
00:02:23,871 --> 00:02:24,621
Impressive.

106
00:02:24,621 --> 00:02:25,280
Which is,

107
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:25,850
you know,

108
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:29,930
like a professor is someone who's
standing on a hill surrounded by a wall,

109
00:02:29,931 --> 00:02:31,310
which is surrounded by another wall,

110
00:02:31,311 --> 00:02:32,630
which is surrounded by another wall.

111
00:02:32,631 --> 00:02:34,190
Like it's walls all the way down.

112
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:35,570
Who stands up there and says,

113
00:02:35,571 --> 00:02:37,010
I'm brave and independent.

114
00:02:37,011 --> 00:02:37,640
It's like,

115
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:40,670
you've got this protected
area that's so unlikely.

116
00:02:40,671 --> 00:02:42,320
It's so absolutely unlikely.

117
00:02:42,321 --> 00:02:46,250
And the fact that people aren't on their
knees in gratitude all the time for the

118
00:02:46,251 --> 00:02:50,360
fact that we have central heating and
air conditioning and Ken pure water and

119
00:02:50,361 --> 00:02:51,350
reliable food,

120
00:02:51,351 --> 00:02:52,070
it's just,

121
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:52,880
it's so,

122
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:53,271
it is.

123
00:02:53,271 --> 00:02:54,830
It's absolutely unbelievable.

124
00:02:55,130 --> 00:02:56,030
People used to die for,

125
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:58,760
then the water supply
was contaminated with,

126
00:02:59,260 --> 00:02:59,890
for heaven's sakes.

127
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:00,280
Right?

128
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,150
People don't understand.

129
00:03:01,151 --> 00:03:01,331
Okay.

130
00:03:01,331 --> 00:03:02,590
Then I had clean water,

131
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:03,670
fresh milk,

132
00:03:03,671 --> 00:03:04,600
fresh orange juice,

133
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:05,330
all of these things.

134
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:06,380
There's a moral goals,

135
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:06,910
the time,

136
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:07,950
all the time that,

137
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:09,820
that w western culture is,

138
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:10,650
is heading.

139
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:10,850
Okay.

140
00:03:10,850 --> 00:03:11,081
It can be,

141
00:03:11,081 --> 00:03:12,680
because we are so dependent on this,

142
00:03:12,681 --> 00:03:16,630
on this invisible infrastructure where
a heading for an absolute catastrophe,

143
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:20,770
when do hottest figure out how
to paralyze the power grid.

144
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:24,220
The entire culture will be chaotic.

145
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,020
You'll have mobs in the street.

146
00:03:26,050 --> 00:03:26,530
Okay.

147
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:27,760
And within three days.

148
00:03:27,761 --> 00:03:27,970
Okay.

149
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:28,150
Window.

150
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:30,760
And so suddenly the food supplies
interrupted and there's no link.

151
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:31,100
There's no,

152
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:32,200
no way to communicate.

153
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:33,400
There'll be like the Robert,

154
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:36,370
I mean that that is the way western
culture is going to collapse.

155
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:36,870
Okay.

156
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:38,140
And it won't take much.

157
00:03:38,141 --> 00:03:39,070
You'll just,

158
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:43,030
because we are so
interconnected and now we are.

159
00:03:43,031 --> 00:03:43,751
So it's so,

160
00:03:43,751 --> 00:03:47,750
it's so dependent on communications
and computers into the,

161
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:48,070
I've,

162
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:48,610
I've,

163
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:51,470
I used to predict for years there'll be
an asteroid hitting the earth and you

164
00:03:51,471 --> 00:03:52,304
have enough,

165
00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:54,570
the solar flares work.

166
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:56,160
So back in,

167
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:58,020
this happens about once every century.

168
00:03:58,021 --> 00:04:01,170
So back about 1880 and I
don't remember the exact year,

169
00:04:01,171 --> 00:04:03,540
there was a significant
enough solar flare,

170
00:04:03,541 --> 00:04:07,440
so that produces an electromagnetic pulse
like a hydrogen bomb because the sun

171
00:04:07,441 --> 00:04:12,441
is a hydrogen bomb and electromagnetic
pulse will emerge from the sun and wave

172
00:04:12,451 --> 00:04:15,800
across the earth and it produces
huge spikes in electrical,

173
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:16,020
uh,

174
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:19,320
electrical current along anything that's
electronic and he'll burn them out.

175
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:23,880
It led it lip telegraph operators on
fire in the 18 hundreds and one of those

176
00:04:23,881 --> 00:04:27,420
things took out the Quebec power grid
in 1985 and knocked out the whole

177
00:04:27,421 --> 00:04:28,470
northeast corridor.

178
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:31,860
And so they figured those things
are about one in new century event.

179
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:33,023
But those single,

180
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:35,610
I have my brother in law
who's a very smart guy.

181
00:04:35,611 --> 00:04:37,680
He designed the chip in the iPhone.

182
00:04:37,681 --> 00:04:41,790
We were talking about political issues
the last time I went and saw him in San

183
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:41,791
Francisco.

184
00:04:41,791 --> 00:04:45,670
And his notion was that all that the
government should be doing right now is

185
00:04:45,671 --> 00:04:49,080
stress testing our infrastructure the
same way they stress test the banks

186
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:52,020
because we're so full of these
single points of failure that,

187
00:04:52,021 --> 00:04:53,340
and I think you're absolutely right.

188
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:54,330
Luckily we've been,

189
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,140
um,

190
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:56,070
what would you call,

191
00:04:56,370 --> 00:04:59,370
invaded by stupid terrorists
instead of smart terrorists?

192
00:04:59,371 --> 00:05:02,970
Because it's a smart terrorist could do
an unbelievable amount of damage in a

193
00:05:02,971 --> 00:05:04,350
very short period of time.

194
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:08,130
So when it's just God's good graces
that that hasn't happened yet.

195
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:09,130
And so,

196
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:11,940
and then what will happen
is that if the men,

197
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:12,301
okay,

198
00:05:12,301 --> 00:05:17,301
the men will reconstruct civilization
while the women cower in the houses.

199
00:05:17,341 --> 00:05:19,440
And I have the men go out
and do all the dirty work.

200
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,520
That's what's going to happen again.

201
00:05:20,521 --> 00:05:21,390
Only men will,

202
00:05:21,391 --> 00:05:23,040
will bring civilization back again.

203
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:23,370
Yeah.
