1
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:09,150
Let's talk about the Saudis for a minute.

2
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:11,610
The elephant under the western carpet,

3
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:16,440
I mean I understand that in the aftermath
of the oil crisis in the 1970s one of

4
00:00:16,441 --> 00:00:20,430
the things that that dictated American
foreign policy was the desire to maintain

5
00:00:20,431 --> 00:00:21,660
stable oil production.

6
00:00:21,661 --> 00:00:21,900
And,

7
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:24,930
and I can understand that although
I think it was short sighted,

8
00:00:24,931 --> 00:00:25,320
I can,

9
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:26,670
I can see the logic in that,

10
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:32,180
but it's very difficult for me to see
that in any possible way the Saudis can be

11
00:00:32,641 --> 00:00:34,650
regarded as true allies of the West.

12
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:40,790
And so I don't understand why we have
the relationship that we do have with the

13
00:00:40,891 --> 00:00:41,790
Saudis given,

14
00:00:41,791 --> 00:00:42,301
first of all,

15
00:00:42,301 --> 00:00:46,950
that we're pumping literally trillions
of dollars every about every decade into

16
00:00:46,951 --> 00:00:47,784
the ricotta me.

17
00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:51,520
And then given that they practice
a particularly pernicious form of,

18
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:56,960
I would say viciously militant Islam
and second or third I guess that is,

19
00:00:57,061 --> 00:01:02,061
is that they're pumping out propaganda
that pushes this Wahhabi viewpoint in

20
00:01:02,491 --> 00:01:04,590
massive doses everywhere in the world.

21
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:05,110
I mean,

22
00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:06,480
I don't understand,

23
00:01:06,481 --> 00:01:10,200
and maybe this is also part
of your perplexity with
regards to western attitudes

24
00:01:10,201 --> 00:01:11,034
towards,

25
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:12,960
towards the complex problem of Islam.

26
00:01:12,961 --> 00:01:17,910
I don't understand why the West
doesn't do more to put a stop to that.

27
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:20,550
And so what are your thoughts about that?

28
00:01:20,551 --> 00:01:21,630
How does it look to you?

29
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:23,550
I'm a flexed,

30
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:27,130
I believe that the south would have
booked the United States and other western

31
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:31,270
listeners and someone has to
come along and break that.

32
00:01:31,930 --> 00:01:32,763
Uh,

33
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:33,520
I liked it.

34
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:38,220
I mean I agree with everything can you
said within Saudi Arabia they don't have,

35
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:40,270
I believe at least three,

36
00:01:40,271 --> 00:01:45,271
four seconds that the royal family who I
believe no one wants to be more secular

37
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:46,713
and more model,

38
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:47,980
they want to go down

39
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:51,190
and then stick larger,

40
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:52,960
incredibly powerful,

41
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:58,050
maybe even more powerful than the
Hawaiian side because the clergy in Saudi

42
00:01:59,140 --> 00:01:59,240
Arabia,

43
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:00,070
yes,

44
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:05,070
they have the power to put into people's
heads and hearts the Wahhabi doctrine.

45
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:10,580
And so,

46
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:13,850
so they are all about in Saudi Arabia,

47
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:19,230
people who decide what's wrong
moral or other clergy time,

48
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:20,540
right?

49
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:20,840
Yeah.

50
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:21,673
That's powerful.

51
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:23,550
And then you have the tribe,

52
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:28,250
the various tribes who obviously
depending on their size,

53
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:32,390
can empower la Croix royal
familiar or the cloud or both.

54
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:36,630
There's a dynamic there that
is very interesting to watch.

55
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:42,200
But in that sense Saudi Arabia
has used and has been George,

56
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:44,460
it's larger

57
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:46,983
established.

58
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,640
He will making a legacy.

59
00:02:49,641 --> 00:02:51,140
Saudi Arabia is a few offices,

60
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:52,803
fewer Medina,

61
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:58,400
not totally inside the borders
of Saudi Arabia and Tyler.

62
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:00,970
Yeah and no.

63
00:03:00,971 --> 00:03:01,631
I think we,

64
00:03:01,631 --> 00:03:06,631
the United States and other countries
need to be mad from the Saudi royal family

65
00:03:06,731 --> 00:03:08,680
because they're the
ones who are political,

66
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:12,100
at least the political
individuals that we deal with her.

67
00:03:12,101 --> 00:03:17,101
We sits you of course for the Tj to demand
and say we need a divorce between the

68
00:03:18,371 --> 00:03:22,910
house of health south and the house of
how hub because these clergy people are

69
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,910
really destroy the planet.

70
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:26,753
You just,

71
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:31,150
you have to think through what these
people have done in South Asia,

72
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:32,163
in Africa,

73
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:34,270
all over the world.

74
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:35,950
It's the beauty of

75
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:41,980
a part of its wealth
to the spread of Islam.

76
00:03:43,170 --> 00:03:44,700
Islam that's pure that way.

77
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:47,800
That is through institutions and this is,

78
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:49,930
this is therefore in policy.

79
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:52,720
We probably could refer
that to us soft house.

80
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:56,860
That's where the [inaudible] but that if
you look at what is happening with all

81
00:03:56,861 --> 00:03:59,800
these terrorist activities
across the world,

82
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:02,590
people wanting Shiria back,

83
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:03,480
all of this,

84
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,800
Saudi Arabia is behind it.

85
00:04:04,801 --> 00:04:07,010
And I think it's time for that.

86
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:07,720
Yeah.

87
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:08,021
Okay.

88
00:04:08,021 --> 00:04:09,700
So let me run a theory by you.

89
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,620
It's kind of a two fold theory.

90
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:17,070
So one is that there's a paternalistic
attitude in the west towards the Saudis

91
00:04:17,770 --> 00:04:22,510
that stems from perhaps events that
were as far back as 100 years ago.

92
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:27,790
And the journalistic aspect is
to underestimate them as enemies,

93
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:28,690
right?

94
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:29,351
Because you say,

95
00:04:29,351 --> 00:04:29,531
well,

96
00:04:29,531 --> 00:04:30,011
we could say,

97
00:04:30,011 --> 00:04:33,760
well we need the oil and we're going to
stabilize it and maybe that we'd rather

98
00:04:33,761 --> 00:04:35,350
not have chaos in Saudi Arabia.

99
00:04:35,351 --> 00:04:38,530
And so a known dictator is
better than unknown chaos.

100
00:04:38,531 --> 00:04:42,550
And I mean we saw some proof of that
perhaps in what happened with Libya,

101
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:47,740
but so the idea would be there's nothing
sufficiently dangerous about the Saudis

102
00:04:47,741 --> 00:04:50,380
to justify us destabilizing their regime,

103
00:04:50,381 --> 00:04:52,900
especially when we're particularly
dependent on their oil.

104
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:58,000
And then underneath that would be an
underestimation of the danger of ideas.

105
00:04:58,180 --> 00:04:58,661
And also,

106
00:04:58,661 --> 00:05:00,790
especially when ideas
are combined with money,

107
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:01,840
it's something like that.

108
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:06,220
So because the Saudis in some sense I
think are are fighting what you might

109
00:05:06,221 --> 00:05:11,221
regard as a stealth war against the
west and they're doing it by convincing

110
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:15,190
upcoming generations of the rightness
of their particular viewpoint.

111
00:05:15,191 --> 00:05:17,770
And so they're in it for
the long haul in some sense.

112
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:22,770
And I think we're radically
underestimating the danger
of that logical walk.

113
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:23,350
And we are not.

114
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:24,150
Yup.

115
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:24,500
Yup.

116
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:25,333
Yeah.

117
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:26,293
Ideological.

118
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:27,403
We're not,

119
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:30,070
I mean you have to think of when
the Soviet Union was around,

120
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:34,570
if we hadn't done anything increase was
if we had only viewed that in economic

121
00:05:34,571 --> 00:05:35,860
terms go in military terms.

122
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,073
And that is

123
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:42,490
not just telling Rabia this is even Iran.

124
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:48,060
These countries are waging an ideological
war and we are not because leave,

125
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,670
well it's religion.

126
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:53,780
Religion is protected and you know,

127
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:58,910
we don't talk about [inaudible] and that's
one thing we believe we are under the

128
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:00,930
spell of these be quite charming.

129
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,420
So that's come to attend our universities
that have the embassies do business

130
00:06:05,421 --> 00:06:08,900
with us and that reassure us that
they're more westernized than we are.

131
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:11,690
You can tell them by how
they treat their women.

132
00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:14,360
Yeah.

133
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,051
So in a way,

134
00:06:15,051 --> 00:06:15,680
I think we,

135
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:16,131
again,

136
00:06:16,131 --> 00:06:20,690
I just keep going back and say we are
under some sort of spells and at some

137
00:06:20,691 --> 00:06:23,660
point someone has to come
and break that smell.

138
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:24,753
Yeah.

139
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:27,380
It's real vogue globalization through,

140
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:28,373
you know,

141
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:29,070
uh,

142
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:30,860
Saudi Arabia opens up to the world.

143
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:33,760
We really see our eyes,

144
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:36,760
what was on inside their
own country and insight,

145
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:39,500
if not just not so do all
of these other countries.

146
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:41,060
It's the people,

147
00:06:41,061 --> 00:06:41,960
the Canadian people,

148
00:06:41,961 --> 00:06:46,961
Western people and say nose and the
mouth from their governments that they

149
00:06:48,321 --> 00:06:50,090
engage with Saudi Arabia
in a different way.
