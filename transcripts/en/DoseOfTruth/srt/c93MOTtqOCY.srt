1
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:04,110
This is an interesting thing to know.

2
00:00:04,111 --> 00:00:05,790
It's called the binomial effect size.

3
00:00:05,791 --> 00:00:09,240
Display effect size is the
magnitude of an effect,

4
00:00:09,241 --> 00:00:09,600
right?

5
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:09,920
And,

6
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:13,110
and it's not an easy thing to get a
handle on all that you really need to if

7
00:00:13,111 --> 00:00:17,460
you're going to be a psychologist because
in any study there's an effect size

8
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:20,280
indicator correlation off
often r and r squared,

9
00:00:20,281 --> 00:00:23,180
which is the correlation squared
or a Cohen's d which has uh,

10
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:25,850
the effect size expressed
in standard deviation.

11
00:00:25,851 --> 00:00:26,730
So something like that,

12
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,960
but you kind of have to understand that
at a basic level to understand what

13
00:00:30,961 --> 00:00:32,130
statistics actually do.

14
00:00:32,131 --> 00:00:36,210
And there's this phenomenon called the
binomial effect size display that can

15
00:00:36,211 --> 00:00:39,990
help you understand what
like an embodied sense,

16
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:42,420
what the magnitude of a correlation means.

17
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:43,680
So here's how it works.

18
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:47,520
Imagine that you have a predictor of 0.2.

19
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:51,590
So the correlation is r
equals 0.2 between um,

20
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:55,710
phenomena one we'll say conscientiousness
and phenomena two workplace

21
00:00:55,711 --> 00:00:57,720
performance 0.2 correlation.

22
00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:59,100
The question might be,

23
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:00,263
well,

24
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:02,970
how much,

25
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:08,750
how much would you improve your predictive
capacity over chance levels if you

26
00:01:09,241 --> 00:01:10,560
applied that predictor?

27
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:14,760
And the answer is that the ar is the
difference between the odds ratio.

28
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:15,870
So let me explain that.

29
00:01:15,871 --> 00:01:20,190
So 0.5 0.5 if you subtract
one from the another,

30
00:01:20,191 --> 00:01:25,191
you get zero so the predictive validity
of selection by chance is 0.5 minus 0.5

31
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:30,330
equals zero that's the
predictive validity of chance.

32
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:34,800
If you have a predictor of
0.2 which is approximately,

33
00:01:34,801 --> 00:01:37,260
that's sort of the low end
estimate for conscientiousness,

34
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:42,530
then that would change your odds ratio
from 0.5 0.5 right random 2.6 0.4 because

35
00:01:45,601 --> 00:01:50,601
0.6 minus 0.4 is 0.2 and so
the correlation coefficient
turns out to be the the

36
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:58,020
difference between the odds between the
odds so and so it gives you a quick rule

37
00:01:58,021 --> 00:01:58,381
of thumb.

38
00:01:58,381 --> 00:01:59,220
So for example,

39
00:01:59,221 --> 00:02:04,221
so if you have a 0.2 predictor that gives
you a 60 40 you have a 0.3 predictor

40
00:02:04,651 --> 00:02:09,651
that gives you 65 35 because 0.65
minus 0.35 is 0.3 and if you have a 0.6

41
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:13,253
predictor,

42
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:14,790
which is really up on the high end,

43
00:02:14,791 --> 00:02:15,001
right,

44
00:02:15,001 --> 00:02:17,750
you're really starting to push your
the limits of statistical prediction,

45
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,830
prediction validity at that point.

46
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:23,580
That gives you a 0.8 minus
0.2 and so what you've done,

47
00:02:23,581 --> 00:02:24,690
if you use a predictive,

48
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:29,880
a predictor that has a correlation
Coefficient of 0.6 which you could get for

49
00:02:29,881 --> 00:02:30,301
example,

50
00:02:30,301 --> 00:02:34,410
if you took conscientiousness and
combine that with a good test of Iq for

51
00:02:34,411 --> 00:02:35,670
predicting complex jobs,

52
00:02:35,671 --> 00:02:39,480
you might be able to get up to 0.6 that
moves your odds ratio of selecting an

53
00:02:39,481 --> 00:02:44,481
above average person for the position
from 0.5 0.5 to 0.8 0.2 so it cuts here

54
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:49,350
your failure rate by more than half,

55
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:49,750
right?

56
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:54,750
It brings it down from 0.5 0.2 because
0.8 minus 0.2 0.6 so that's a really good

57
00:02:56,521 --> 00:02:56,941
thing to know.

58
00:02:56,941 --> 00:02:58,800
That's called the binomial
effect size display.

59
00:02:58,801 --> 00:03:00,310
It's good thing to have in your mind.

60
00:03:00,311 --> 00:03:01,061
It's very simple.

61
00:03:01,061 --> 00:03:01,894
It's just a,

62
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:05,680
it's just subtraction and it gives
you some sense of the power of,

63
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:06,880
of,

64
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,230
of statistical prediction.

65
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:10,450
Now the question might be,

66
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:10,811
well,

67
00:03:10,811 --> 00:03:13,900
let's say you had a predictor
of 0.2 the conscientiousness,

68
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:14,651
you might say,

69
00:03:14,651 --> 00:03:15,401
well if you square,

70
00:03:15,401 --> 00:03:16,234
they are,

71
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:18,010
that gives you 4% of the variance.

72
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:18,970
Like who the hell cares?

73
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:20,560
4% of the variance.

74
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:25,800
You've left 95% of the variability between
people in terms of their performance

75
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:27,323
unexplained.

76
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:28,031
You might say,

77
00:03:28,031 --> 00:03:28,181
well,

78
00:03:28,181 --> 00:03:29,140
why even bother?

79
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:29,650
Well,

80
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:34,650
the answer to that question is how much
difference in productive output is there

81
00:03:35,231 --> 00:03:36,064
between people?

82
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:39,130
Because if there's a tremendous
degree of productive,

83
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:41,680
of difference in productive
output between people,

84
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:46,210
then increasing your ability to predict
someone's performance even by some

85
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:50,260
relatively small increment might
have massive economic utility.

86
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:50,831
You know,

87
00:03:50,831 --> 00:03:51,030
if,

88
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:56,030
if let's say the top 10% of your people
are 50 times as productive as the bottom

89
00:03:56,171 --> 00:03:57,340
10% of your people,

90
00:03:57,550 --> 00:04:00,820
then shifting your ability to predict
up so that you have more of those

91
00:04:00,821 --> 00:04:04,470
extremely high performing people or
less of the extremely low performing PR

92
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:06,940
people might more than pay off,

93
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:10,570
might more than pay for itself
from an economic perspective.

94
00:04:10,571 --> 00:04:11,710
Even though your prediction,

95
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:13,030
your predictor isn't,

96
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:16,930
it doesn't have that massive amount of
power when that actually happens to be

97
00:04:16,931 --> 00:04:17,530
the case.

98
00:04:17,530 --> 00:04:20,530
So back in 1968 there was a
guy named Walter Michelle,

99
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:21,491
he had reviewed,

100
00:04:21,491 --> 00:04:22,600
he's a social psychologist.

101
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:26,710
He reviewed the personality literature
up to that point and concluded that the

102
00:04:26,711 --> 00:04:31,711
typical personality measure only predicted
the typical performance measure at

103
00:04:31,811 --> 00:04:34,870
about 0.2 and that's actually
remained relatively stable.

104
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:36,290
I would say it's a
little higher than that.

105
00:04:36,291 --> 00:04:40,000
It's probably 0.25 especially if you
do things like correct for measurement

106
00:04:40,001 --> 00:04:40,870
error and so forth.

107
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:42,310
And what Michelle said was,

108
00:04:42,311 --> 00:04:45,760
because it's only 0.25
let's say you square that,

109
00:04:45,761 --> 00:04:47,350
that's 5% of the variants.

110
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:50,170
You leave 95% of the
phenomena unexplained,

111
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:52,990
you might as well not even
bother measuring personality.

112
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:56,830
And so that actually killed the field
of personality from a psychometric

113
00:04:56,831 --> 00:05:01,330
perspective for about 25 years really
until about the early 1990s when people

114
00:05:01,331 --> 00:05:02,170
woke up and thought,

115
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:03,063
wait a minute,

116
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:07,810
what are the typical effect sizes
in other domains of prediction?

117
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:09,340
And then they found out that,

118
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:09,970
well,

119
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:14,680
the 0.2 correlation that was typical
of personality prediction was actually

120
00:05:14,681 --> 00:05:18,850
pretty damn good by social sciences
or health sciences standards.

121
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:22,720
Like it doesn't sound good when you just
think about it as an absolute measure

122
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:25,900
because it leaves 95% of
the phenomena unexplained.

123
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:29,620
But when you compare it to other things
that people consider of reasonable

124
00:05:29,621 --> 00:05:33,910
magnitude than it turns out
that personality psychologists
are doing just fine.

125
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:37,160
And then also in the 1990s and
I'll show you some of this there,

126
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:39,250
economic calculations done and the,

127
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,750
so one of the calculations would be,

128
00:05:40,751 --> 00:05:42,700
well imagine that you have,

129
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:48,030
maybe it took 20 companies and you did
it a distribution of the productivity of

130
00:05:48,221 --> 00:05:48,970
their employees.

131
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:51,340
It's hard thing to do because you
have to measure their productivity.

132
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,720
It's like how the hell do you do that?

133
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:53,230
Right?

134
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:53,981
With salespeople,

135
00:05:53,981 --> 00:05:55,150
you can measure sales.

136
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:58,700
That's pretty straight forward
with you can measure hours billed.

137
00:05:58,701 --> 00:05:59,534
Like there are some,

138
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:03,500
there are some occupations where the
performance measure is sort of built into

139
00:06:03,501 --> 00:06:04,250
the job.

140
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:07,580
But if you're a manager in the
mid level of a large corporation,

141
00:06:07,581 --> 00:06:09,560
how the hell can you tell
how productive you are?

142
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:14,360
So there's a measurement problem on the
productivity measurement and as well as

143
00:06:14,361 --> 00:06:16,190
the performance prediction and,

144
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:16,701
and it's,

145
00:06:16,701 --> 00:06:18,230
it's a very intractable problem.

146
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:20,750
And the way that people
often do that is by saying,

147
00:06:20,751 --> 00:06:23,720
well let's say you're a manager
in the mid level of a corporation.

148
00:06:23,721 --> 00:06:25,430
How do we determine how productive we are?

149
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:26,150
You are,

150
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:26,361
well,

151
00:06:26,361 --> 00:06:30,890
we might ask you to compare your
work productivity with your peers,

152
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:34,760
maybe construct up a questionnaire asking
about your efficient use of time and

153
00:06:34,761 --> 00:06:35,594
so forth.

154
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:38,300
And then we might get your peers
to do the same thing to you.

155
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:42,230
We might get your supervisors to do the
same thing to you and we might get your,

156
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:45,800
your subordinates to do the same thing
to you and then aggregate across all

157
00:06:45,801 --> 00:06:50,801
those measures and infer that that
aggregate opinion actually constitutes a

158
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:52,640
valid measure of productivity.

159
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:54,200
You actually don't know,

160
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:54,561
right,

161
00:06:54,561 --> 00:06:58,610
because that assumes that what you're
doing that your peers and your supervisors

162
00:06:58,611 --> 00:06:59,444
and so forth,

163
00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:03,980
our rating is actually related in some
positive manner to the bottom line of the

164
00:07:03,981 --> 00:07:05,240
company and you actually don't,

165
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:06,830
you actually can't figure that out.

166
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:07,851
This is actually,

167
00:07:07,851 --> 00:07:12,290
I think why why large companies start
to become unstable is because if there's

168
00:07:12,291 --> 00:07:16,700
enough layers between the operations
of the people in the tears of the

169
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:19,970
corporation and the real outcome measure,

170
00:07:19,971 --> 00:07:22,730
which is basically profit
because that's what we've got.

171
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:24,230
Then the,

172
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:28,790
the relationship between your activity
as a manager and the productivity of the

173
00:07:28,791 --> 00:07:32,480
company starts to become increasingly
blurred and that might mean that you're

174
00:07:32,481 --> 00:07:35,690
working as hard as you can on something
that's actually going to cost the

175
00:07:35,691 --> 00:07:36,524
company money.

176
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:40,550
So you would actually be much more
productive from a profit perspective if he

177
00:07:40,551 --> 00:07:44,480
just didn't go to work at all and that
that happens a lot in large corporations

178
00:07:44,481 --> 00:07:45,770
because you'd never know,

179
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,910
especially if there's a lot of steps
that have to be undertaken in a process

180
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:52,550
before you can test the
product in the market.

181
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:56,570
You have no idea if you're wasting
time and resources you just can't tell.

182
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:59,240
So the performance
measurement issue is a very,

183
00:07:59,241 --> 00:08:00,290
very complicated one.

184
00:08:00,470 --> 00:08:01,940
We haven't talked about it that much,

185
00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:04,130
but I give you a kind of
a brief overview of it.

186
00:08:04,131 --> 00:08:08,510
Now what you really want to do is have
multiple sources of information about

187
00:08:08,511 --> 00:08:12,110
performance and aggregate across them
and if you can use real world measures

188
00:08:12,111 --> 00:08:14,780
that are tied to two income generation,

189
00:08:14,781 --> 00:08:18,050
so much the better because you have to
use something as your gold standard,

190
00:08:18,051 --> 00:08:18,290
right?

191
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:20,000
You have to say at some point,

192
00:08:20,170 --> 00:08:20,381
well,

193
00:08:20,381 --> 00:08:24,560
we're going to define this as reality
when it comes to performance and in a free

194
00:08:24,561 --> 00:08:25,371
market economy,

195
00:08:25,371 --> 00:08:29,000
roughly what you do there is you say
that what profit is the proxy for

196
00:08:29,001 --> 00:08:29,834
productivity,

197
00:08:30,170 --> 00:08:33,590
and that isn't the same thing saying is
that it isn't the same thing as saying

198
00:08:33,591 --> 00:08:36,200
that profit is productivity.

199
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:37,640
That's not the same thing.

200
00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:41,780
It's saying that at some point you have
to decide what you're going to accept as

201
00:08:41,781 --> 00:08:44,870
a measure of productivity because
otherwise there's no point in even talking

202
00:08:44,871 --> 00:08:49,850
about it and you can't just not talk
about productivity if you're running an

203
00:08:49,851 --> 00:08:54,140
organization because the organization
doesn't exist unless it produces something

204
00:08:54,141 --> 00:08:55,220
that we'll keep it going.

205
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:57,200
And generally that happens to be money.
