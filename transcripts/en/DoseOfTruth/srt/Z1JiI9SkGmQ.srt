1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,930
I started to think about belief systems,

2
00:00:02,931 --> 00:00:03,764
you know,

3
00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:06,920
because you could say that each
camp had its own belief system.

4
00:00:06,921 --> 00:00:08,390
The one in the West was derived.

5
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:14,020
It had a very lengthy history derived
from the Greeks and the Romans and Jews

6
00:00:14,841 --> 00:00:15,790
and the Christians and,

7
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:20,810
and from various schools of philosophy
and from the enlightenment and all of

8
00:00:20,811 --> 00:00:21,081
that.

9
00:00:21,081 --> 00:00:26,081
And then the Soviet Union was basically
predicated on a rational philosophy that

10
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:31,960
that opposed the axioms that the West had
evolved and each group organized their

11
00:00:34,641 --> 00:00:35,780
societies around that.

12
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:36,963
And,

13
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:38,380
okay.

14
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:38,740
No,

15
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:40,780
I took political science
for quite a long time.

16
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:43,720
Okay.

17
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:45,820
And the political scientists
and the economists,

18
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:50,050
they basically thought that
people competed over resources.

19
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:51,793
Um,

20
00:00:52,090 --> 00:00:54,910
but that wasn't a very good answer as
far as I was concerned because it wasn't

21
00:00:54,911 --> 00:00:58,060
obvious to me why people valued
the resources they value.

22
00:00:58,090 --> 00:00:59,470
There was the economist,

23
00:00:59,471 --> 00:01:02,260
just assume that there's
resources that you value,

24
00:01:02,290 --> 00:01:03,071
but you know,

25
00:01:03,071 --> 00:01:05,110
people can value a lot
of different things.

26
00:01:05,111 --> 00:01:05,660
It's,

27
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:07,180
it's not exactly fixed.

28
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:07,720
I mean,

29
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:09,970
you tend to value food very
highly if you're hungry,

30
00:01:09,971 --> 00:01:10,511
obviously.

31
00:01:10,511 --> 00:01:11,291
But you know,

32
00:01:11,291 --> 00:01:15,790
there's lots of things that we value
and that we want that seem somewhat

33
00:01:15,791 --> 00:01:16,660
arbitrary.

34
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:18,070
Someone like a decision.

35
00:01:18,850 --> 00:01:22,840
So I got more interested in why people
valued things and what it meant to value

36
00:01:22,841 --> 00:01:26,260
something and then what it
meant to believe something.

37
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:32,880
And then how it could be that someone
could believe something so deeply that

38
00:01:33,851 --> 00:01:38,740
they would risk their own death to
protect it or at least risk the death of

39
00:01:38,741 --> 00:01:39,574
other people.

40
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:42,940
And maybe on a massive scale like man,

41
00:01:42,941 --> 00:01:44,380
people are committed to their,

42
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:45,670
to their system.

43
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:47,140
Now,

44
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:47,860
you know,

45
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:50,590
a system of belief is not
just a system of belief.

46
00:01:50,591 --> 00:01:54,190
That's one of the things that I came to
understand is that it's not appropriate

47
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:56,650
to make this too psychological.

48
00:01:57,370 --> 00:01:58,810
People defend their belief systems,

49
00:01:58,811 --> 00:02:00,010
but that's not exactly right.

50
00:02:00,011 --> 00:02:00,580
You know,

51
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:02,440
we have a shared belief system.

52
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:06,550
Well it's sufficiently
shared so that here we are,

53
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:08,110
we don't know each other.

54
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:09,700
We're a bunch of primates,

55
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:14,600
we're in this room and it's
peaceful and no one's scared.

56
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:16,220
And that's pretty amazing.

57
00:02:16,221 --> 00:02:18,920
And that means that we're
all acting out our roles.

58
00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:21,170
So we're acting out or roles.

59
00:02:21,171 --> 00:02:26,030
And we have an expectation with regards
to those roles and those two things

60
00:02:26,031 --> 00:02:30,170
match and that's the important thing
and we'll talk about that a lot.

61
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:35,120
It isn't the belief system
or the integrity of the
belief system even it's the

62
00:02:35,121 --> 00:02:39,620
match between the belief system and the
actions of the other people within the

63
00:02:39,621 --> 00:02:40,454
belief system.

64
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,560
What you want to maintain is that match.

65
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:48,010
You want to act out your beliefs in
the world and you want what you want to

66
00:02:48,081 --> 00:02:48,860
happen.

67
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:49,611
That's good thing.

68
00:02:49,611 --> 00:02:52,190
You get what you want and you
validate your belief system.

69
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,233
Great,

70
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,740
perfect security,

71
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:58,760
but a lot of that is if we're
interacting even right now,

72
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:02,470
there's a whole set of expectations
that are governing what we're doing.

73
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:03,940
Like you don't want me to take your,

74
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:06,010
your little tablet there and smash it.

75
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,600
That would be shocking,

76
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:07,960
right?

77
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,250
You wouldn't know what the hell to do.

78
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:10,000
Right?

79
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,000
You'd be somewhere different if I did
that and you would know where you were and

80
00:03:16,511 --> 00:03:20,830
that's another thing to know because
that's a fundamental difference.

81
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:26,080
There is a fundamental difference between
knowing where you are and not knowing

82
00:03:26,531 --> 00:03:27,364
where you are.

83
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:28,870
I think it's,

84
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:30,940
in some sense the fundamental difference.

85
00:03:30,941 --> 00:03:34,240
You can think about it as the distinction
between explored an unexplored

86
00:03:34,241 --> 00:03:35,074
territory,

87
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:36,220
but you have to.
