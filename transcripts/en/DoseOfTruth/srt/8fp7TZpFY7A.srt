1
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:09,600
So I want to tell you about a book
today.

2
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:12,240
The book is called the Gulag
Archipelago.

3
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:18,450
You Ready?
The book is called the Gulag Archipelago

4
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:23,690
and it's by a Russian author.
Soviet arts are deemed Aleksandr

5
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:28,590
Solzhenitsyn,
who was in the Gulag archipelago

6
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:32,280
concentration camp system for a very
long time.

7
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:37,110
He had a very hard life.
He was on the

8
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:44,240
Russian front when the Germans invaded
the Soviet Union in the early stages of

9
00:00:45,481 --> 00:00:49,260
World War II.
Now Hitler and Stalin had signed a

10
00:00:49,261 --> 00:00:51,710
nonaggression pact.
Um,

11
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:55,640
okay.

12
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:58,760
And Hitler invaded the Soviet Union
anyway.

13
00:00:58,790 --> 00:01:01,010
And from what I've been able to
understand,

14
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:05,810
the Soviets had prepared an invasion
force for Europe at that point,

15
00:01:05,811 --> 00:01:09,320
but we're not concerned with having to
defend their territory.

16
00:01:09,321 --> 00:01:12,440
And so they were caught completely
unawares by Hitler's move.

17
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:16,970
And the conditions on the Russian front
were absolutely dreadful.

18
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,830
And soldier in Hudson was a soldier on
the Russian front and

19
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:27,740
he wrote some letters to one of his
friends,

20
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:31,910
which were intercepted,
complaining about the lack of

21
00:01:31,911 --> 00:01:36,911
preparation and,
and using bitter dark humor to describe

22
00:01:37,821 --> 00:01:38,840
the situation.
And

23
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:44,180
the consequences of that was that he was
thrown into a work camp.

24
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:49,750
The Soviet system relied on work camps.
And so those were large labor camps of

25
00:01:51,051 --> 00:01:54,980
people who were essentially enslaved,
many of whom were worked to death,

26
00:01:55,010 --> 00:01:58,280
often froze to death,
working in conditions that were so

27
00:01:58,281 --> 00:02:00,620
dreadful that they're virtually
unimaginable.

28
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:05,960
Solzhenitsyn spent a very large number
of years in these camps,

29
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:08,960
uh,
sometimes in a more privileged camp

30
00:02:08,961 --> 00:02:11,840
because he was an educated man and
sometimes in worst camps.

31
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:15,230
He also,
uh,

32
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:17,900
developed cancer,
uh,

33
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:23,150
later and wrote a book about that called
Cancer Ward,

34
00:02:23,151 --> 00:02:25,600
which is a brilliant book.
Um,

35
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:27,940
so he had a very hard life.
There's,

36
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,130
there's just no way around that to be on
the front and then to be in a

37
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:33,440
concentration camp and then to have
cancer.

38
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:38,060
That's pretty rough.
Now he wrote the Gulag archipelago.

39
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:44,390
He wrote a book called one day in the
life of Ivan Denisovich first that was

40
00:02:44,391 --> 00:02:47,660
published in the early 1960s when there
was a brief thaw.

41
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:51,770
Stalin was pretty much out of the
picture by the end of the 1950s.

42
00:02:51,771 --> 00:02:56,690
There's some indication that he was
murdered by Khrushchev and a cruise ship

43
00:02:56,691 --> 00:03:01,691
became a premier of the Soviet Union
afters stolen and there's some

44
00:03:03,791 --> 00:03:07,750
indication perhaps that Stellan was
either murdered by Khrushchev and a set

45
00:03:07,751 --> 00:03:12,751
of his cronies or when he was very ill
just before he died was not helped at

46
00:03:14,351 --> 00:03:18,850
least by wasn't provided with any
medical attention because of the

47
00:03:18,851 --> 00:03:20,590
intervention of Khrushchev and his
cronies.

48
00:03:20,591 --> 00:03:25,120
Now there was some indication as well at
that point that Stalin who was an

49
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:29,740
absolute absolutely barbaric in every
possible way you could imagine was

50
00:03:29,741 --> 00:03:34,741
planning to start a third World War and
he was certainly capable of doing such

51
00:03:35,261 --> 00:03:40,261
things because he had already imprisoned
or killed tens of millions of people.

52
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:45,550
Now
just after Stalin died,

53
00:03:45,551 --> 00:03:48,460
there was a bit of a thought in the
Soviet Union with regards to internal

54
00:03:48,461 --> 00:03:51,670
repression.
In the early 1960s Solzhenitsyn

55
00:03:51,671 --> 00:03:54,610
published a book called one day in the
life of Ivan Denisovich,

56
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:57,040
which was a story about one day in the
life.

57
00:03:57,100 --> 00:04:02,020
His life really inside one of these so
called Gulag archipelago camps.

58
00:04:02,021 --> 00:04:05,470
Now he called it the Gulag archipelago
because in our compelling go is a chain

59
00:04:05,471 --> 00:04:09,790
of islands.
And so Solzhenitsyn likened the work

60
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:12,910
camp system in the Soviet Union,
which was made up of isolated camps

61
00:04:12,911 --> 00:04:17,740
distributed across the entire state.
He likened that to a series of islands

62
00:04:17,741 --> 00:04:19,600
and enhance,
hence the metaphor.

63
00:04:20,170 --> 00:04:23,290
And one day in the life of Ivan
Denisovich was one of the first

64
00:04:23,291 --> 00:04:28,291
publications released in the Soviet
Union that dared make public what had

65
00:04:29,231 --> 00:04:32,230
happened inside these camps,
at least initially.

66
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:36,370
Now that thought didn't last very long,
but that book had a tremendous effect.

67
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:38,080
It's a short book,
it's worth reading.

68
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:41,590
Um,
after that he spent,

69
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:43,810
he wrote a number of other books,
which are also great.

70
00:04:43,811 --> 00:04:47,470
He's a great literary figure in the same
category I would say as Tolstoy or

71
00:04:47,471 --> 00:04:50,170
Dostoevsky,
which is like really saying something,

72
00:04:50,171 --> 00:04:50,651
you know,
those,

73
00:04:50,651 --> 00:04:53,050
those two are perhaps the greatest
literary figures.

74
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:55,780
Whoever lived with the possible
exception of Shakespeare.

75
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:59,800
He wrote this book called the Gulag
Archipelago,

76
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:03,790
which is published in three volumes,
each of which has about 700 pages long.

77
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:07,930
Um,
the first one details the origin of the

78
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:11,470
oppressive Soviet system,
at least in part under Lenin.

79
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:15,310
And then it's full fledged
implementation understanding and the

80
00:05:15,311 --> 00:05:18,340
deaths of,
while Solzhenitsyn estimated the deaths

81
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:23,380
in internal repression in the Soviet
Union at something approximating 60

82
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:28,360
million between 1919 in 1959.
Now that doesn't count the death toll in

83
00:05:28,361 --> 00:05:29,740
the second world war,
by the way.

84
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:34,690
Now people have disputed those figures,
but there certainly in the tens of

85
00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:37,300
millions in the low inbounds are
probably 20 million and the high end

86
00:05:37,301 --> 00:05:38,830
bounds or nearer,
what's old soldier in,

87
00:05:38,831 --> 00:05:39,640
it's an estimated.

88
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:44,640
He also estimated that the same kind of
internal repression in Maoist China cost

89
00:05:45,551 --> 00:05:49,270
100 million lives.
And so you can imagine that the genuine

90
00:05:49,271 --> 00:05:51,400
historical figures,
again,

91
00:05:51,401 --> 00:05:54,790
are subject to dispute,
but somewhere between 50 and 100 million

92
00:05:54,791 --> 00:05:56,830
people.
And one of the things that's really

93
00:05:56,900 --> 00:06:00,830
surprising to me and that that I think
is absolutely reprehensible,

94
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:05,030
absolutely reprehensible,
is the fact that this is not widespread

95
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:07,250
knowledge among students in the west,
any of this.

96
00:06:07,251 --> 00:06:10,460
And it's because your education,
your historical education,

97
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:12,650
if you started to describe it as
appalling,

98
00:06:12,651 --> 00:06:16,040
you would barely scratch the surface.
These were the most important events of

99
00:06:16,041 --> 00:06:20,510
the 20th century and they're barely
covered at all in standard historical

100
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:22,020
curriculum.
You know,

101
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:26,840
something I would presume about World
War II and about the terrible situation

102
00:06:26,841 --> 00:06:31,040
in Nazi Germany and the death of 6
million Gypsies and Jews and homosexuals

103
00:06:31,041 --> 00:06:33,890
in the concentration camps in Nazi
Germany.

104
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:38,120
But my experience with students has been
that none of them know anything about

105
00:06:38,121 --> 00:06:42,260
what happened as a consequence of the
repression of the radical left in the

106
00:06:42,261 --> 00:06:43,040
20th century.

107
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:48,040
And I believe the reason for that is
that the communist system had extensive

108
00:06:49,431 --> 00:06:53,930
networks of admirers in the west,
especially among intellectuals and still

109
00:06:53,931 --> 00:06:56,510
in fact does,
which is also equally reprehensible.

110
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:58,560
Um,
and I believe the,

111
00:06:58,770 --> 00:07:03,770
one of the consequences of that is that
this element of history has been under,

112
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,110
uh,
under,

113
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:11,030
what would you say under examined and
certainly very little attention has been

114
00:07:11,031 --> 00:07:13,460
brought to it in the public school
curricula.

115
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:15,710
And there's absolutely no excuse for
that.

116
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:18,380
It was the worst thing that happened in
the 20th century.

117
00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:21,260
And that's really saying something
because the 20th century was about as

118
00:07:21,261 --> 00:07:23,390
bad as it gets.
And so,

119
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,850
and the fact that these,
these massive,

120
00:07:25,851 --> 00:07:30,560
these deaths on massive scale occurred,
and the fact that we don't know that

121
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:32,420
deep inside our bones is,
is,

122
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:36,110
is a testament to the absolute rot of
the education system.
