1
00:00:02,110 --> 00:00:06,180
I started to introduce all those topics
because I was trying to address the

2
00:00:06,181 --> 00:00:10,830
issue of how it is that we've come to
deal with the fact that things are so

3
00:00:10,831 --> 00:00:15,600
complex that we can't deal with them and
so a huge part of the answer to that is

4
00:00:15,601 --> 00:00:16,800
the Darwinian answers.

5
00:00:16,801 --> 00:00:20,550
One is while you keep up with things
you can't keep up with by changing

6
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:21,413
unpredictably.

7
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:23,190
So here's an example.

8
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:27,600
You know sometimes if you're driving
down the road and there's a deer on the

9
00:00:27,601 --> 00:00:28,434
road,

10
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:31,050
maybe you'll run into it and it'll
instead of jumping out of the way,

11
00:00:31,051 --> 00:00:33,450
it sort of jumps randomly
and then you run into it.

12
00:00:33,451 --> 00:00:33,751
You think,

13
00:00:33,751 --> 00:00:35,220
well that's a pretty stupid strategy.

14
00:00:35,221 --> 00:00:38,400
It's like natural selection at work there,

15
00:00:38,401 --> 00:00:41,790
but it turns out that deer jump
randomly when wolves are chasing them.

16
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:42,930
Well,

17
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:43,920
why would you do that?

18
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:44,251
Well,

19
00:00:44,251 --> 00:00:45,360
because you can't predict it,

20
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:46,080
right?

21
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:46,390
If,

22
00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:49,860
if something horrible is after you
acting unpredictably is actually a pretty

23
00:00:49,861 --> 00:00:53,280
good strategy and that's basically
what mutation does means.

24
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:57,900
The horrible thing that's after you
always is the rapid transformation of the

25
00:00:57,901 --> 00:01:01,800
environment and the only thing you can
possibly do in that in that case is

26
00:01:01,801 --> 00:01:03,150
capitalize on chance.

27
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:03,631
Okay,

28
00:01:03,631 --> 00:01:04,464
so that's one thing.

29
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:08,460
So that's partly why the Darwinian
story I think has to be right,

30
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:14,330
because the environment does
move unpredictably and the
only way you can keep up

31
00:01:14,791 --> 00:01:15,990
with something that's unpredictable,

32
00:01:15,991 --> 00:01:20,991
to generate variance and hope that one
of them has drawn the lucky lottery card,

33
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,750
but then there's these additional
issues which is that we're also.

34
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:29,751
We also seem to be tightly selected for
the capacity to cooperate and compete.

35
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:31,980
So that multiplies our cognitive ability.

36
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,180
That's a huge part of it.

37
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,400
And then we're also.

38
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:38,040
We also seem to have
constructed ourselves,

39
00:01:38,041 --> 00:01:38,874
so to speak,

40
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:42,810
through sexual choice into
these general problem,

41
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:43,891
general purpose,

42
00:01:43,891 --> 00:01:45,150
problem solving creatures.

43
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:48,510
And so we've internalized
some of the Darwinian process.

44
00:01:48,511 --> 00:01:49,590
So you think,

45
00:01:49,591 --> 00:01:50,424
well,

46
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:54,990
most animals will produce a variance of
themselves physically and then most of

47
00:01:54,991 --> 00:01:55,980
those variants die,

48
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:00,000
but human beings have built A.

49
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,530
Lance built a mechanism,

50
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:04,170
let's say that's like a game engine.

51
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:05,340
I think that's a really good.

52
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:09,620
You know how there are game engines
now that people have devised their,

53
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:14,460
their computational devices and you can
take a game engine and you can generate

54
00:02:14,461 --> 00:02:16,050
games with it like computer games.

55
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:20,280
So I'm the game engine is a
mechanism for producing games.

56
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:20,491
Well,

57
00:02:20,491 --> 00:02:21,990
that's what our brains are like.

58
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:27,080
Our brains are game engines for producing
games and so what happens is that when

59
00:02:27,241 --> 00:02:29,400
you think you produce
an Avatar of yourself,

60
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:34,110
you produce a fictional world and that
that Avatar and habits and maybe you

61
00:02:34,111 --> 00:02:36,720
produce multiple fictional
worlds in multiple avatars,

62
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:38,910
that's the EU that could be tomorrow,

63
00:02:38,911 --> 00:02:42,990
which is what you're doing when you're
planning and you walk the Avatar through

64
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:46,920
its potential routes and those that look
good and you keep and those that don't

65
00:02:46,921 --> 00:02:47,221
look good,

66
00:02:47,221 --> 00:02:49,860
you kill and so you can.

67
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:54,600
Then you can embody the ideas that you
keep an act those out and hopefully the

68
00:02:54,601 --> 00:02:56,460
idea is that when you embody them,

69
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,770
you're successful and
you don't get killed.

70
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:00,610
And so we're select.

71
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:04,510
We've also seen that when
we've been selecting each
other for cognitive prowess,

72
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:09,160
we've been selecting ourselves for
the ability to generate avatars out of

73
00:03:09,161 --> 00:03:11,500
ourself and kill them instead of dying.

74
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,240
It's unbelievably brilliant.

75
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:13,990
And,

76
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:17,320
and that's really akin to the
human discovery of the future.

77
00:03:17,321 --> 00:03:17,531
Right?

78
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:20,290
The future is a place where
variance of you could exist.

79
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:23,800
It's something like that and other
animals don't seem to be able to do that.

80
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:26,320
So we're very sneaky.

81
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:29,620
And while so far doesn't
seem to be working too badly,

82
00:03:29,621 --> 00:03:31,240
although we haven't been
around for very long,

83
00:03:31,241 --> 00:03:31,481
right?

84
00:03:31,481 --> 00:03:36,481
I mean human beings of our particular
sub species about 150,000 years,

85
00:03:36,761 --> 00:03:37,594
something like that,

86
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:40,450
which is from an evolutionary timeframe.

87
00:03:40,451 --> 00:03:42,370
It's like it's nothing,

88
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:43,110
you know,

89
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:45,430
it's 2080 year old man.

90
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:47,020
It's not very long,

91
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:47,740
you know,

92
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:48,820
if you think about it that way.

93
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,193
Okay.

94
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:51,603
So

95
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:03,920
now what I want to do is
draw a relationship between
that developmental process,

96
00:04:03,921 --> 00:04:08,690
that evolutionary process and the
emergence of these underlying motivational

97
00:04:08,691 --> 00:04:09,524
systems.

98
00:04:10,130 --> 00:04:11,090
It's something like this.

99
00:04:11,091 --> 00:04:14,120
So you imagine you go back in time to
the emergence of the development of

100
00:04:14,121 --> 00:04:15,080
nervous systems.

101
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:20,470
So there's cells that creatures
use to do produce motor output,

102
00:04:22,161 --> 00:04:26,780
and there are cells that creatures use
to map the patterns around them onto

103
00:04:26,781 --> 00:04:27,321
themselves.

104
00:04:27,321 --> 00:04:28,790
And so those are that sensory.

105
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:30,230
That's the sensory layer,

106
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:31,093
so to speak.

107
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,590
Imagine sensory layer,

108
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:35,960
nervous layer,

109
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:37,453
motor layer.

110
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:38,870
In simpler animals,

111
00:04:38,871 --> 00:04:40,700
you just have sensory motor cells.

112
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:43,880
Then they diversify sensory layer,

113
00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:45,043
nervous layer,

114
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:46,040
motor layer.

115
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:46,371
In fact,

116
00:04:46,371 --> 00:04:50,030
that's actually what you consist of
when you're first developing in utero.

117
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:51,890
After the blast site stage,

118
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:53,360
when your cells differentiate,

119
00:04:53,361 --> 00:04:54,380
that's the differentiation.

120
00:04:54,381 --> 00:04:55,310
Sensory layer,

121
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:56,473
nervous layer,

122
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:57,500
motor layer.

123
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,150
So then you think there's a sensory layer.

124
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,520
Now what's that sensory layer doing?

125
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:08,080
Think about the world as consists
consisting of patterns of all sorts,

126
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:11,890
like maybe there's an animal in the
ocean and it's being subjected to wave

127
00:05:11,891 --> 00:05:12,724
motion,

128
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:17,320
and so it's sensory systems map the
wave motion onto the motor output.

129
00:05:17,321 --> 00:05:18,760
So if you look at a sponge,

130
00:05:18,761 --> 00:05:19,594
for example,

131
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:23,260
sponges are good examples because they're
sort of half unicellular animals and

132
00:05:23,261 --> 00:05:24,420
half multicellular animals.

133
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:28,630
You can take a sponge and run it through
a colander and separate it out into

134
00:05:28,631 --> 00:05:29,464
cells,

135
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,880
say in salt water,

136
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:33,340
and it'll assemble itself
back into a sponge.

137
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:34,710
So it sort of at the.

138
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:35,200
Yeah,

139
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:35,730
amazing.

140
00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:36,563
Hey,

141
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,200
it's kind of what you do in Utero.

142
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:43,880
It sells somehow know enough to
communicate with another to one another to

143
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:45,790
organize themselves into an organism's.

144
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:47,171
It's unbelievable.

145
00:05:47,171 --> 00:05:51,800
We have no idea how people do that because
when you're in the initial form blast

146
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:52,360
site form,

147
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:55,330
all those cells are identical
genetically and then all of a sudden they

148
00:05:55,331 --> 00:05:58,430
differentiate and they moved other
places they're supposed to go.

149
00:05:58,550 --> 00:05:59,780
We have no idea how that.

150
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,400
How the hell can that happen?

151
00:06:01,401 --> 00:06:01,831
These cells,

152
00:06:01,831 --> 00:06:04,280
they're all identical
except for their position,

153
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:08,630
so they're obviously communicating
with one another in some unbelievably

154
00:06:08,631 --> 00:06:10,460
complicated way and saying,

155
00:06:10,461 --> 00:06:10,910
well,

156
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:14,090
you know this sort of sell it and so
you're going to differentiate that way.

157
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,433
God only knows,

158
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:16,091
but anyway,

159
00:06:16,091 --> 00:06:17,150
sponges can do this.

160
00:06:17,151 --> 00:06:17,984
Now,

161
00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:23,180
a sponge isn't complicated enough to
have the sensory layer and the service

162
00:06:23,181 --> 00:06:24,230
layer and the motor layer.

163
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,090
It's just sensory motor cells,

164
00:06:26,091 --> 00:06:27,020
if I remember correctly,

165
00:06:27,021 --> 00:06:30,950
but what the sponge is trying to figure
out is it wants to get water through its

166
00:06:30,951 --> 00:06:35,951
pores inside because that's how it eats
and so there's wave motion constantly

167
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:40,190
and so what's happening is the wave motion
is a pattern and the sponges reacting

168
00:06:40,191 --> 00:06:42,440
to that in a patterned
way and that's a really.

169
00:06:42,441 --> 00:06:47,390
It's really useful to think about what
you're responding to as patterns instead

170
00:06:47,391 --> 00:06:49,880
of objects because we
think we react to objects,

171
00:06:49,881 --> 00:06:54,881
but objects are actually a specific
subcategory of pattern and so because they

172
00:06:54,961 --> 00:06:56,990
don't also helps to explain perception.

173
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:57,620
It's like,

174
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:57,780
well,

175
00:06:57,780 --> 00:06:59,600
what does it mean for
you to see something?

176
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:00,643
Well,

177
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:02,330
it means a bunch of things,

178
00:07:02,331 --> 00:07:06,050
but one of the things that means
is when I look at that thing,

179
00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:10,220
it manifests itself to
me as a grippable object.

180
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:13,400
I mean that that's built
into the way I see it.

181
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:17,240
So if you think about the way that
you see that on the surface there,

182
00:07:17,241 --> 00:07:19,880
you can tell that it's separate from
the surface because it has a bit of a

183
00:07:19,881 --> 00:07:24,881
shadow and it's a different color and
it's obviously shaped for a hand and so

184
00:07:25,491 --> 00:07:28,820
that thing tells you when you look
at it that it's the grabbable object.

185
00:07:28,821 --> 00:07:29,090
Well it's,

186
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:34,090
it's hand shaped like a stone tool would
be and so and all the things around you

187
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:38,900
in the world manifest themselves as
patterns of utility that that's the

188
00:07:38,901 --> 00:07:39,950
appropriate way to think about it.

189
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:40,581
You say,

190
00:07:40,581 --> 00:07:40,731
well,

191
00:07:40,731 --> 00:07:42,170
what does this thing mean?

192
00:07:42,410 --> 00:07:43,610
Because that's a hard question.

193
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:44,803
Well,

194
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:46,790
one of the things that your eyes do,

195
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:47,630
it's like,

196
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:51,500
imagine you've got this representational
surface at the back of your retina.

197
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,760
It's made out of pixels,

198
00:07:52,761 --> 00:07:53,630
roughly speaking,

199
00:07:53,631 --> 00:07:53,841
right?

200
00:07:53,841 --> 00:07:58,841
Those are the cells and what it does
is map that pattern onto your retinal

201
00:07:59,061 --> 00:08:03,290
pattern and then the retinal pattern
propagates itself as a nervous pattern

202
00:08:03,291 --> 00:08:03,561
loan.

203
00:08:03,561 --> 00:08:04,400
Your optic nerve.

204
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:09,200
And then that manifests itself as a
neurological pattern and that neurological

205
00:08:09,201 --> 00:08:11,690
pattern manifests itself
as an action pattern.

206
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:16,880
And so the meaning of the object is the
action pattern that is mapped onto the,

207
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:18,590
onto the percept.

208
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:21,740
And so what does this mean?

209
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:23,040
This is what it means.

210
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:25,850
I think this is a Piagetian observation.

211
00:08:25,851 --> 00:08:27,350
It's like wonder many

212
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,193
one,

213
00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:31,963
right?

214
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,260
Because I'm acting like it's one,

215
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:34,610
but if I do this

216
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:41,680
then it's many y one,

217
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:42,830
two,

218
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:45,590
right there separately
manipulable entities.

219
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:50,390
And so the concept of number
is in fact predicated,

220
00:08:50,391 --> 00:08:51,350
at least in part

221
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:55,770
on the idea of singular usability.

222
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:56,821
But you're mapping.

223
00:08:56,821 --> 00:08:57,241
It's like,

224
00:08:57,241 --> 00:08:58,021
well what is this?

225
00:08:58,021 --> 00:08:58,650
It's a key.

226
00:08:58,650 --> 00:08:58,891
Well,

227
00:08:58,891 --> 00:08:59,641
what does that mean?

228
00:08:59,641 --> 00:08:59,791
Well,

229
00:08:59,791 --> 00:09:03,810
I mapping that shape into this
motion for that action say,

230
00:09:03,811 --> 00:09:03,961
well,

231
00:09:03,961 --> 00:09:05,010
it's not just a key,

232
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:06,383
it's a weapon,

233
00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:08,123
right?

234
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:10,800
And so that's because I've mapped
it onto a different output pattern.

235
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:15,090
But if you think about perception as
the matching of patterns onto patterns,

236
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:15,721
it makes,

237
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:17,280
it makes way more sense.

238
00:09:17,281 --> 00:09:19,380
You can really start thinking
about how perception works,

239
00:09:19,381 --> 00:09:22,620
because then you can also start
thinking about unconscious perception.

240
00:09:22,621 --> 00:09:23,730
So you know the,

241
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:26,790
the blind sight experiments
show for example,

242
00:09:26,791 --> 00:09:28,100
that if,

243
00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:29,880
if you've had cortical damage,

244
00:09:29,881 --> 00:09:31,320
so you think you're blind,

245
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:33,300
you can't see objects anymore,

246
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,720
but I show you a picture
of a frightened face,

247
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:39,540
you'll show us in skin conductance
response to it and you think,

248
00:09:39,541 --> 00:09:39,661
well,

249
00:09:39,661 --> 00:09:40,770
how the hell can that happen?

250
00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:45,770
It's like I have to see the face in order
to infer the emotion in order to have

251
00:09:46,141 --> 00:09:46,831
the reaction.

252
00:09:46,831 --> 00:09:47,101
It's like,

253
00:09:47,101 --> 00:09:47,251
no,

254
00:09:47,251 --> 00:09:47,880
you don't.

255
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:48,900
You don't need that at all.

256
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:54,260
You need a pattern recognition system
that maps that right onto an amygdala

257
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:57,570
output that produces
physiological readiness.

258
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:00,510
You don't need the perceptible
entity because you know,

259
00:10:00,511 --> 00:10:03,660
you think you see something and then
you think about the thing and then you

260
00:10:03,661 --> 00:10:05,160
evaluate the thing and then you act.

261
00:10:05,161 --> 00:10:06,690
It's like you do do that.

262
00:10:06,691 --> 00:10:08,610
But there are parts of you
that don't do that at all.

263
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,200
Way Faster parts,

264
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:11,340
more primordial parts.

265
00:10:11,341 --> 00:10:15,300
And so another example would be Darwin's
trick with the snake that I told you

266
00:10:15,301 --> 00:10:15,481
about.

267
00:10:15,481 --> 00:10:20,481
He'd go to this museum that had a
cobra in a glass cage and the Cobra,

268
00:10:20,641 --> 00:10:23,790
he'd put his face up to the glass cage
and the Cobra would strike out him and

269
00:10:23,791 --> 00:10:24,660
he'd go like this,

270
00:10:24,661 --> 00:10:26,640
and there was no way
he could control that.

271
00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:27,151
Well,

272
00:10:27,151 --> 00:10:32,151
it's because the part of him that saw
the snake wasn't the part that was doing

273
00:10:32,461 --> 00:10:33,294
this.

274
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,970
There's a part of him
that does this to snakes.

275
00:10:36,090 --> 00:10:37,330
That's what it does and it's.

276
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:39,720
It's way faster than the per unit figure,

277
00:10:39,721 --> 00:10:43,610
the to see the snake
you have to the images.

278
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:45,060
Obviously the image,

279
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:50,070
the pattern is portrayed on the
retina propagates backwards to see it.

280
00:10:50,071 --> 00:10:53,340
It has to be elaborated up through
a very complex set of neurological

281
00:10:53,341 --> 00:10:55,050
connections that takes time.

282
00:10:55,710 --> 00:10:56,730
And so your dad.

283
00:10:57,210 --> 00:10:57,451
Well,

284
00:10:57,451 --> 00:10:59,670
the thing that snake means this,

285
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:04,700
that's like three neurons super fast
and so what is a snake at that level of

286
00:11:07,171 --> 00:11:08,010
representation?

287
00:11:08,011 --> 00:11:12,210
It's like a snake is that which makes
you do this and then you could also say

288
00:11:12,211 --> 00:11:14,010
that at that level of representation,

289
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,680
everything that makes you
do this is the same thing,

290
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:17,940
right?

291
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:22,940
Because the same would be defined by the
pattern that you manifest in response

292
00:11:23,101 --> 00:11:23,934
to that entity,

293
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,640
so then your nervous
system is layered very,

294
00:11:26,641 --> 00:11:30,480
very sensory layer neurological layer,

295
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:31,830
motor layer.

296
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:34,020
As you become more complex,

297
00:11:34,021 --> 00:11:38,070
the sensory layer differentiates into
the different sensory systems and the

298
00:11:38,071 --> 00:11:43,071
neurological level multiplies in terms
of its potential number of connections.

299
00:11:43,261 --> 00:11:47,460
So what happens is that you can map
patterns that manifest themselves in

300
00:11:47,461 --> 00:11:48,990
multiple different ways,

301
00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:52,740
in multiple different ways
to multiple motor outputs.

302
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:54,760
So you start with a fixed action pattern,

303
00:11:54,761 --> 00:11:55,740
which is just like this.

304
00:11:56,180 --> 00:12:00,910
The the sponge reflects
what's the world to a sponge.

305
00:12:01,090 --> 00:12:03,970
The world is what makes you
go like this or like that.

306
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:04,863
That's it.

307
00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:06,010
That's the whole world.

308
00:12:06,011 --> 00:12:09,430
The sponge has compressed
the entire world into pores,

309
00:12:09,431 --> 00:12:10,390
open pores closed.

310
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:11,030
That's,

311
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:12,370
that's it to states.

312
00:12:13,090 --> 00:12:17,830
And then once the nervous system gets
differentiated and the senses get

313
00:12:17,831 --> 00:12:18,670
differentiated,

314
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,770
so there's specialized kinds of cells,

315
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:25,120
then you can detect
more forms of patterns.

316
00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:29,350
You can produce more
patterned output to that,

317
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:31,030
but even more interestingly,

318
00:12:31,031 --> 00:12:33,850
and this is where the nervous
system starts to come into play,

319
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:38,170
the mapping of the pattern onto
the output is no longer one to one.

320
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:41,020
You can use the same pattern
roughly speaking to British,

321
00:12:41,021 --> 00:12:44,800
all sorts of different outputs that are
context dependent because you might say,

322
00:12:44,801 --> 00:12:45,634
well,

323
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:50,990
so okay,

324
00:12:50,991 --> 00:12:52,040
I picked that up and you say,

325
00:12:52,041 --> 00:12:52,221
well,

326
00:12:52,221 --> 00:12:52,940
he picked that up.

327
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:53,301
It's okay.

328
00:12:53,301 --> 00:12:54,470
Well what about that?

329
00:12:56,770 --> 00:12:57,071
You think,

330
00:12:57,071 --> 00:12:57,191
well,

331
00:12:57,191 --> 00:12:57,761
he picked it up.

332
00:12:57,761 --> 00:12:57,941
Well,

333
00:12:57,941 --> 00:12:58,351
yeah,

334
00:12:58,351 --> 00:12:58,541
yeah,

335
00:12:58,541 --> 00:12:58,871
I did.

336
00:12:58,871 --> 00:13:03,871
Except that the pattern of musculature
that I used to do this is by no means

337
00:13:05,141 --> 00:13:08,050
identical to the pattern of
musculature that I used to do that.

338
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:08,530
Right?

339
00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:11,740
I mean the fact that the orientation is
different is actually extraordinarily

340
00:13:11,741 --> 00:13:12,574
important.

341
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:13,563
So,

342
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:15,303
so.

343
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:15,941
Well,

344
00:13:15,941 --> 00:13:16,591
my point is,

345
00:13:16,591 --> 00:13:17,424
is that right?

346
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:21,290
We're sufficient nervous complexity.

347
00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:23,810
You can take the same thing,

348
00:13:23,930 --> 00:13:27,560
so to speak and map it all sorts of
different ways and human beings are

349
00:13:28,310 --> 00:13:29,420
unbelievably good at that.

350
00:13:29,690 --> 00:13:29,991
Okay,

351
00:13:29,991 --> 00:13:33,020
so now go back to when things were simple.

352
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:37,010
So there's single celled
organisms will say,

353
00:13:37,011 --> 00:13:40,460
and then they start to differentiate to
some degree and they start to propagate

354
00:13:40,730 --> 00:13:45,050
and so then there's the environment
starts to shift because the fact of the

355
00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:49,160
prevalence of all of these competitors
means the environment isn't exactly the

356
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:51,920
same as it was when that
system first evolved,

357
00:13:51,950 --> 00:13:56,030
new problems emerge and so then there's
selection pressure on those creatures to

358
00:13:56,031 --> 00:14:00,200
diversify to some degree and then the
diversification produces a transformation

359
00:14:00,201 --> 00:14:04,490
in the environment and then
there's pressure on those
new entities to diversify

360
00:14:04,491 --> 00:14:05,031
some more.

361
00:14:05,031 --> 00:14:07,610
And so you get this weird
bootstrapping process.

362
00:14:07,970 --> 00:14:10,970
Maybe the environment is one
thing when there's 10 of you,

363
00:14:10,971 --> 00:14:13,370
but a completely different thing
when there's a thousand of you.

364
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:14,451
Right?

365
00:14:14,451 --> 00:14:17,510
So just sheer multiplication is
going to transform the environment.

366
00:14:17,511 --> 00:14:19,130
And so then the.

367
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:23,240
Because the environment has now become
more complex than it was their selection

368
00:14:23,241 --> 00:14:26,930
pressure to produce diversification
in the underlying organisms.

369
00:14:26,931 --> 00:14:29,210
And that took a long time
to get off the ground.

370
00:14:29,211 --> 00:14:33,590
Like there were single celled
organisms for a huge span of history.

371
00:14:33,591 --> 00:14:34,250
I mean,

372
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:36,020
if you look at evolutionary history,

373
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:40,820
the amount of time that there were single
celled organisms is far longer than

374
00:14:40,821 --> 00:14:43,390
the time that there's been since
the remotely celled organisms.

375
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,350
It's like it's like Moore's law.

376
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:47,760
You know the law that governs the,

377
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:49,520
the increase in computational power.

378
00:14:49,521 --> 00:14:52,510
You can trace that back
to about the year $1,400,

379
00:14:52,511 --> 00:14:53,344
something like that.

380
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:57,020
So it's been going on for a very long
time and maybe you could make the same

381
00:14:57,021 --> 00:14:58,610
case from an evolutionary perspective.

382
00:14:58,611 --> 00:15:01,610
It's like the flat part of
the curve is really long,

383
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:03,080
but once it starts to move up,

384
00:15:03,081 --> 00:15:06,830
it starts to move up really
fast and obviously that's
the position that we're in

385
00:15:06,831 --> 00:15:07,520
now.

386
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:10,040
So single celled
organisms for a long time.

387
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:13,280
Then they started to diversify
and then you could imagine,

388
00:15:13,281 --> 00:15:14,114
well

389
00:15:15,170 --> 00:15:16,640
from the single cell organism,

390
00:15:16,641 --> 00:15:19,940
you start getting multicellular
organism and then it ends up with this

391
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:21,320
tripartite structure,

392
00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:22,640
sensory layer,

393
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:23,540
nervous layer,

394
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:24,943
motor layer,

395
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:29,480
and then that starts to differentiate
and every time there's a differentiation

396
00:15:29,481 --> 00:15:32,900
that's conserved and that's these systems.

397
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,370
The motivational systems.

398
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:36,290
He emerged a long,

399
00:15:36,291 --> 00:15:41,291
long time ago as emergent solutions to
emergent problems and you've conserved

400
00:15:41,721 --> 00:15:42,320
all of them.

401
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,720
I mean you've conserved your snake reflex,

402
00:15:44,721 --> 00:15:47,180
which is like three neurons long,

403
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:48,771
so that's really,

404
00:15:48,771 --> 00:15:49,760
really primordial,

405
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,080
but you've conserved,

406
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:54,320
you've conserved function at
almost every temporal level,

407
00:15:54,890 --> 00:15:59,360
so there's parts of you that are quick
and dirty and parts of you that are slow

408
00:15:59,361 --> 00:16:04,100
and sophisticated and a lot of the
contents of consciousness is slow and

409
00:16:04,101 --> 00:16:04,934
sophisticated,

410
00:16:05,210 --> 00:16:07,040
so it can't help you out in an emergency,

411
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:11,180
but it can do or consciousness
seems to do is take your structure,

412
00:16:12,590 --> 00:16:14,400
it analyzes the world's for,

413
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:15,253
for let's say,

414
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:18,110
mismatches between what you
want and what's happening,

415
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:23,120
and then it either helps you alter the
world so those mismatches go away or it

416
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:24,090
turns inward.

417
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:27,320
Ma modifies the structures
that you're using.

418
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:29,450
So if you're playing the piano,

419
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:33,680
you've got this automatized routine has
very little to do with consciousness.

420
00:16:33,681 --> 00:16:35,810
If you've practiced enough
and you make a mistake,

421
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:39,410
you stop and you note the mistake,

422
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:43,940
you stop and then you slow
it down and then you read.

423
00:16:44,330 --> 00:16:46,310
You practice the new thing.

424
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:47,511
Then you speed it up.

425
00:16:47,511 --> 00:16:48,290
Then you speed it up,

426
00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:50,180
then you speed it up and
as you're doing that,

427
00:16:50,181 --> 00:16:54,110
the neural representation shrinks until
you've developed this little specialized

428
00:16:54,111 --> 00:16:57,500
machine and then you run that a few
times and now you can ignore it.

429
00:16:57,890 --> 00:17:00,350
You can look at the notes and
just play and away you go,

430
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:02,810
and that's kind of what
consciousness is doing all the time.

431
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:08,140
You're laying out an
automatized routine and then if,

432
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:11,420
if that doesn't produce
the intended outcome,

433
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:12,590
you stop.

434
00:17:12,590 --> 00:17:16,370
You become conscious really
because nothing like an
error to make you conscious.

435
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:21,940
Then you do a high resolution analysis
of the space in which the error emerged.

436
00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:25,220
You rematch your motor output,

437
00:17:25,221 --> 00:17:29,390
your perceptions and all of that to make
that error go away in a way you go and

438
00:17:29,391 --> 00:17:31,160
so your consciousness is continually.

439
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:35,240
Your consciousness seems to be
continually building your unconscious,

440
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:37,280
your procedural unconscious,

441
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:38,600
and so to some degree,

442
00:17:38,601 --> 00:17:42,890
the purpose of consciousness is to
make you functional unconsciously,

443
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:44,091
right?

444
00:17:44,091 --> 00:17:45,080
Because that's way better.

445
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:47,600
You don't want to be conscious
if most things because it's just,

446
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:48,261
what are you going to do?

447
00:17:48,261 --> 00:17:50,120
Be Conscious of your digestive processes.

448
00:17:50,121 --> 00:17:50,740
It's like,

449
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:51,573
no,

450
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:53,720
if you're good at something,

451
00:17:53,721 --> 00:17:55,580
you hardly have to be
conscious of it at all.

452
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:55,820
So.
