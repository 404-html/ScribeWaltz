1
00:00:00,890 --> 00:00:03,350
So I guess the case that
I was making last time,

2
00:00:03,410 --> 00:00:04,250
at least in part,

3
00:00:04,251 --> 00:00:05,084
was that

4
00:00:06,530 --> 00:00:11,530
you're one of one way of conceptualizing
the fundamental problem that human

5
00:00:12,921 --> 00:00:13,611
beings face,

6
00:00:13,611 --> 00:00:18,611
is to conceptualize it as an
ongoing struggle with complexity and

7
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:23,910
complexity

8
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:28,170
emerges as a consequence of

9
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:35,150
the sort of finite boundedness
of individual consciousness.

10
00:00:35,151 --> 00:00:35,984
And uh,

11
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:42,290
it incredible excess of the unbounded
every way are everywhere else even

12
00:00:44,701 --> 00:00:46,470
including underneath that consciousness.

13
00:00:46,471 --> 00:00:51,060
Because of course your
individual consciousness
depends on the function or is

14
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,400
related to the function of
things that are so complex.

15
00:00:53,401 --> 00:00:54,690
You can't even understand it.

16
00:00:55,200 --> 00:01:00,200
So there you are surrounded by some
things that you understand in an,

17
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:04,410
in an ocean of things that you don't
understand at all and including things

18
00:01:04,411 --> 00:01:05,244
about yourself.

19
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:11,240
And it's not obvious at all how people
solve that problem because in some sense

20
00:01:11,371 --> 00:01:12,450
it's not solvable.

21
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:17,400
The fact that you don't have the cognitive
resources or the conceptual resources

22
00:01:17,401 --> 00:01:20,850
to understand everything that you need
to understand in order to properly orient

23
00:01:20,851 --> 00:01:21,840
yourself in the world.

24
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:23,700
Now obviously,

25
00:01:23,701 --> 00:01:27,210
partly the way we deal with that is that
we cooperate with other people and so

26
00:01:27,211 --> 00:01:31,620
that radically multiplies our resources
and credibly multiplies our resources.

27
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:33,023
So,

28
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:34,503
and it's all,

29
00:01:34,510 --> 00:01:36,350
it's something to consider always when,

30
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:42,560
so much of the political
dialog that surrounds us now
consists of a critique of,

31
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:46,360
of cooperative societies and uh,

32
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:49,300
an analysis of their oppressive nature.

33
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:52,530
Of course that's true because
any cooperative system,

34
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:58,980
it specifies a certain endpoint and
produces a value hierarchy of some sort.

35
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,810
Also simultaneously forces
things into that value system.

36
00:02:03,811 --> 00:02:04,830
And then rank orders,

37
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:09,390
people according to the value structure
and so there's an oppressive element to

38
00:02:09,391 --> 00:02:09,630
it,

39
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:14,340
but compared to being naked in chaos,

40
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:18,660
generally it's better now.

41
00:02:18,661 --> 00:02:20,790
It doesn't always have to be
because it can get murderous.

42
00:02:20,791 --> 00:02:21,840
But generally speaking,

43
00:02:21,841 --> 00:02:22,350
well look,

44
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:23,270
we're social animals.

45
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:24,123
It doesn't matter.

46
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:28,440
Our evolutionary pathway has already
taken us here and so we're individuals,

47
00:02:28,441 --> 00:02:32,760
but we're unbelievably
social and so that's that.

48
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:34,230
So as far as I can tell,

49
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:37,590
we'd have to be completely
different creatures not to fall,

50
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:42,690
not to take advantage of and fall prey
to the problems with social being.

51
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:43,860
Alright.

52
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:44,693
So

53
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:53,130
I think the way that the problem
of complexity has been solved,

54
00:02:53,171 --> 00:02:58,120
and this is the best argument I know of
for the truth of the Darwinian notion of

55
00:02:58,121 --> 00:02:59,590
evolution now,

56
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:03,550
I don't think that our models of evolution
are complete by any stretch of the

57
00:03:03,551 --> 00:03:04,384
imagination.

58
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:05,680
All right?

59
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:10,210
I know they're not partly because
of recent work done in epigenetics,

60
00:03:10,211 --> 00:03:12,640
which suggests that you can acquire,

61
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:14,380
you can inherit acquired traits.

62
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:15,461
Right?

63
00:03:15,461 --> 00:03:17,110
And when I went to university,

64
00:03:17,111 --> 00:03:19,060
when I started going to
university in the 19 eighties,

65
00:03:19,061 --> 00:03:21,160
that was heresy really.

66
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:22,023
Like,

67
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:22,840
no,

68
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:25,600
you cannot inherit acquired traits,

69
00:03:25,601 --> 00:03:28,060
but actually you can
inherit acquired traits.

70
00:03:28,061 --> 00:03:29,780
That's the field of epigenetic studies.

71
00:03:29,781 --> 00:03:31,150
That and that.

72
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:35,890
That's a radical shift in perspective
because we also don't know exactly what

73
00:03:35,891 --> 00:03:37,600
that means across any length of time.

74
00:03:37,601 --> 00:03:39,940
And when you're thinking about
evolutionary lengths of time,

75
00:03:39,941 --> 00:03:43,060
you're thinking about three and a half
billion years because that's the span of

76
00:03:43,061 --> 00:03:44,440
time over which life evolved.

77
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:49,440
And so even things that don't have a
overwhelmingly market potency for one

78
00:03:52,301 --> 00:03:55,180
generation can be unbelievably
powerful across time.

79
00:03:55,690 --> 00:04:00,090
And then there's also the issue of
sexual sexual selection because you know,

80
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:04,630
you'll hear darwinist
continually described the world
and the evolutionary world

81
00:04:04,631 --> 00:04:09,220
as a place of randomness and that's not
true and I don't know why they make that

82
00:04:09,221 --> 00:04:10,054
statement.

83
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:15,910
The mutations are random or quasi random
because we don't understand mutations

84
00:04:15,911 --> 00:04:16,721
that well yet either.

85
00:04:16,721 --> 00:04:18,220
And most mutations are deadly,

86
00:04:18,221 --> 00:04:18,700
right?

87
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:19,990
Most mutations are deadly.

88
00:04:19,991 --> 00:04:22,600
There's a set of them that
are harmful but not deadly.

89
00:04:22,601 --> 00:04:23,500
And then there's a tiny,

90
00:04:23,501 --> 00:04:28,501
tiny proportion that could in principle
produced some benefit to the next

91
00:04:28,961 --> 00:04:32,820
generation assuming environmental
environmental shift,

92
00:04:32,821 --> 00:04:34,450
say in the direction of the mutation.

93
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:35,763
So.

94
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:36,641
And that's,

95
00:04:36,641 --> 00:04:38,110
there's a randomness element to that.

96
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:38,681
We know that,

97
00:04:38,681 --> 00:04:38,921
I mean,

98
00:04:38,921 --> 00:04:43,921
part of the reason that you mutate or
your cells mutate your DNA mutates is

99
00:04:43,991 --> 00:04:47,320
because of background
levels of radioactivity.

100
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:50,200
And a lot of that's a
consequence of solar activity,

101
00:04:50,201 --> 00:04:50,441
right?

102
00:04:50,441 --> 00:04:54,160
So cosmic rays come zipping through the
atmosphere and they nail your DNA and

103
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:57,070
produce minor alterations
and that's a mutation.

104
00:04:57,071 --> 00:04:59,560
And if you crank up the
background radiation rate,

105
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:00,850
like say around Chernobyl,

106
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:02,650
then the mutation rate rises.

107
00:05:02,651 --> 00:05:07,300
And there's definitely a random element
to that and it's necessary for there to

108
00:05:07,301 --> 00:05:10,660
be a random element because
as far as I can tell,

109
00:05:10,661 --> 00:05:15,130
the only way you can beat
a random environment is by
producing random changes.

110
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:15,671
Right?

111
00:05:15,671 --> 00:05:17,440
So you know the idea,

112
00:05:17,441 --> 00:05:18,330
basically the,

113
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:23,050
the environment isn't some static place
that's selecting for higher and higher

114
00:05:23,051 --> 00:05:25,300
levels of fitness or not in any,

115
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:26,343
not in any.

116
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,690
It's certainly not doing
that in any static way.

117
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:33,280
And so it's shifting around
randomly and then you know,

118
00:05:33,281 --> 00:05:36,670
you have a structure that's been
your species has a structure that's a

119
00:05:36,671 --> 00:05:40,720
consequence of this immense evolutionary
journey and it's moderating itself

120
00:05:40,721 --> 00:05:42,640
randomly within certain parameters.

121
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:45,220
The parameters being that
most mutations will kill you,

122
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:48,310
like alterations in your fundamental
form generally tend to kill you.

123
00:05:48,311 --> 00:05:52,930
So they're incremental and so the
mutations are random and they match.

124
00:05:52,931 --> 00:05:56,530
Hopefully they ratchet the randomness in
the environmental shift and so you can

125
00:05:56,531 --> 00:05:57,860
more or less up that way,

126
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,700
but then there's additional complicating
factors and they're not trivial.

127
00:06:01,701 --> 00:06:03,680
And one of them is
whatever epigenetics does.

128
00:06:03,681 --> 00:06:05,090
We don't know anything about that yet.

129
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,220
But the second one is sexual selection.

130
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:09,860
And sexual selection is no joke.

131
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:13,640
It could be the primary thing is
certainly one of the primary things that's

132
00:06:13,641 --> 00:06:15,860
driven human evolution and
I think you can say that

133
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:21,410
you think about the environment.

134
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:22,280
Again,

135
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:23,630
let's think about the environment.

136
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:27,740
So you have a dominance hierarchy
and that's really old structure.

137
00:06:27,741 --> 00:06:32,210
The dominance hierarchy is 300 million
years old because it emerged pretty much

138
00:06:32,211 --> 00:06:33,080
whenever there was.

139
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:34,700
Whenever there was a nervous system,

140
00:06:34,701 --> 00:06:36,680
emergent nervous system and whatever.

141
00:06:36,681 --> 00:06:38,570
Animals had to occupy the same territory.

142
00:06:38,571 --> 00:06:41,900
They automatically organized themselves
into something approximating a dominance

143
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:42,231
hierarchy.

144
00:06:42,231 --> 00:06:43,520
So it's a very,

145
00:06:43,521 --> 00:06:43,911
very,

146
00:06:43,911 --> 00:06:44,301
very,

147
00:06:44,301 --> 00:06:45,560
very old structure.

148
00:06:45,561 --> 00:06:46,880
It's older than trees.

149
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:48,560
It's older than flowers,

150
00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:49,910
it's old.

151
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:54,200
And as far as real goes
from a Darwinian sense,

152
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:56,330
permanent is real.

153
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:58,020
And so when you,

154
00:06:58,021 --> 00:06:58,461
you can say,

155
00:06:58,461 --> 00:06:58,731
well,

156
00:06:58,731 --> 00:06:59,060
you know,

157
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:04,060
arboreal ancestors adapted themselves to
trees and so the tree was a long around

158
00:07:04,761 --> 00:07:07,010
long enough to be a
feature of the environment.

159
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:10,460
But the dominance hierarchy has
been around a lot longer than trees.

160
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:14,150
And you can think of the dominance
hierarchy both as an adaptation to the

161
00:07:14,151 --> 00:07:14,930
environment,

162
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:18,200
because you'd kind of think about the
dominant Turkey has a cultural construct,

163
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:22,400
but if a cultural construct lasts long
enough that it becomes part of the

164
00:07:22,401 --> 00:07:26,180
environment and so the dominant Turkey's
part of the environment and what seems

165
00:07:26,181 --> 00:07:28,220
to happen roughly speaking,

166
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:30,590
and this is an oversimplification
but we'll go with it,

167
00:07:30,591 --> 00:07:35,591
is that males have a dominance hierarchy
and there's a relatively small number

168
00:07:37,161 --> 00:07:41,420
of males that are relatively successful
and those successful males have

169
00:07:41,421 --> 00:07:46,421
preferential access to female reproductive
capacity either because the females

170
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:49,520
actively choose the the
more dominant males,

171
00:07:49,521 --> 00:07:50,181
which is very,

172
00:07:50,181 --> 00:07:55,070
very common or because the more dominant
males chase all the less dominant males

173
00:07:55,071 --> 00:07:58,790
away so that even if the
females don't exercise choice,

174
00:07:58,791 --> 00:07:59,840
which they often do,

175
00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:05,050
then the only males left around
that can serve as reasonable.

176
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:08,090
Mating partners are
the more powerful ones.

177
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:13,220
And so you think you got to really
radical determiners of evolution as a

178
00:08:13,221 --> 00:08:14,450
consequence of that one.

179
00:08:14,451 --> 00:08:16,730
Is that each.

180
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:20,270
I'm not talking about female
dominance hierarchies at the moment,

181
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:21,770
but I can talk about that,

182
00:08:21,771 --> 00:08:23,780
but that's why this is oversimplification,

183
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:28,700
but what happens is that
the males obviously are
selected for their ability to

184
00:08:28,701 --> 00:08:32,450
move up dominance hierarchies obviously
because the ones that are at the top of

185
00:08:32,451 --> 00:08:36,500
the dominance hierarchy reproduce
preferentially and so that means the male

186
00:08:36,501 --> 00:08:39,890
dominance hierarchy becomes
a method of selection,

187
00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:45,130
but then allied with that is the female
proclivity for choice on whatever

188
00:08:45,981 --> 00:08:49,730
dimension the dominance hierarchy
happens to be arranged and so then female

189
00:08:49,731 --> 00:08:54,731
sexual selection also becomes a
radical nonrandom selector of,

190
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:57,780
of,

191
00:08:57,780 --> 00:08:58,740
of what,

192
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,560
what genetic material is going
to move into the next generation.

193
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:02,633
And so I,

194
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:07,410
I failed to see how any of that can be
separated from the emergence of complex

195
00:09:07,411 --> 00:09:11,190
nervous systems and mind over the
course of evolution because people are.

196
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:13,590
Creatures aren't making random choices.

197
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:15,120
They're not random at all.

198
00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:20,810
So we even know such things
like imagine a peacock's tail,

199
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:22,120
you know,

200
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,190
it's covered with ice,

201
00:09:23,191 --> 00:09:26,370
which is quite interesting because eyes
of course attract attention and lots of

202
00:09:26,371 --> 00:09:27,300
animals have evolved.

203
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,500
I liked markets like moss.

204
00:09:29,501 --> 00:09:31,440
There's moss that when
they unfold their wings,

205
00:09:31,441 --> 00:09:34,230
they have two big eyes on the back of
them and that's to keep birds from eating

206
00:09:34,231 --> 00:09:34,561
them right?

207
00:09:34,561 --> 00:09:36,360
Because the birds don't
like being stared at,

208
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:37,800
so they stay away from the moths.

209
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,390
But so a peacock's tail,

210
00:09:39,391 --> 00:09:43,290
there's nothing but eyes and so it's very
attractive and it shimmers and there's

211
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:44,520
something about it that's beautiful,

212
00:09:44,521 --> 00:09:45,960
which is quite interesting to.

213
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:50,190
The females have obviously been selecting
the male peacock peacocks for beauty.

214
00:09:50,191 --> 00:09:53,370
They have this insane tail while so they,

215
00:09:53,371 --> 00:09:54,840
evolutionary biologists have thought,

216
00:09:54,841 --> 00:09:55,140
well,

217
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:57,900
what possible utility could that tail be?

218
00:09:57,900 --> 00:10:01,020
Is it just maybe the
females got fixated on tail,

219
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:01,831
so to speak,

220
00:10:01,831 --> 00:10:03,040
and you know,

221
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:07,110
you've got a Baldwin infect loop going
there and the male peacocks just got

222
00:10:07,111 --> 00:10:09,780
bigger and bigger tales and it's
just like an evolutionary dead end.

223
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:10,020
It's,

224
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:10,291
you know,

225
00:10:10,291 --> 00:10:13,320
it's a positive feedback system
that's gone out of control,

226
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:17,480
but they have done things that
like look at the cemetery and,

227
00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:18,230
and,

228
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:19,440
and breadth say,

229
00:10:19,441 --> 00:10:24,441
or the symmetry and size and overall
quality of the male peacock's tail as a

230
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:26,220
marker for physical health.

231
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:28,440
So reduce parasite load for example.

232
00:10:28,441 --> 00:10:32,070
And it does turn out that the healthier
male peacocks have better tail display.

233
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:36,540
And so the way what the females seem to
be doing is using some marker or some

234
00:10:36,541 --> 00:10:39,750
set of markers as a proxy indicator for,

235
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:40,973
for,

236
00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:41,843
for health.

237
00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:44,970
And I think I think you could say with,

238
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:46,200
with reasonable,

239
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:50,790
you could say reasonable that reasonably
that female human beings do the same

240
00:10:50,791 --> 00:10:51,930
thing to male human beings.

241
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:54,030
And there's some of that vice versa too.

242
00:10:54,031 --> 00:10:55,140
Like we evaluate each other,

243
00:10:55,141 --> 00:10:55,711
for example,

244
00:10:55,711 --> 00:10:56,371
for symmetry,

245
00:10:56,371 --> 00:11:00,000
which is one of the elements of beauty
because healthier people tend to be more

246
00:11:00,001 --> 00:11:02,520
symmetrical and lots of
animals use symmetry.

247
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:03,443
Butterflies,

248
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:07,470
butterflies won't mate with another
butterfly if it deviates from cemetery by

249
00:11:07,471 --> 00:11:09,240
the tiniest amounts you can imagine.

250
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:10,800
So symmetry is a marker.

251
00:11:10,801 --> 00:11:15,560
And there's other markers like
shoulder width to waist width is one,

252
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:17,520
and waist to hip width is another.

253
00:11:17,521 --> 00:11:18,810
That's usually what mail is.

254
00:11:18,811 --> 00:11:20,670
Use that to evaluate females in part.

255
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:22,500
So there's lots of markers of health.

256
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:28,740
But it also looks to me like the data
worldwide seems to indicate that women.

257
00:11:29,610 --> 00:11:32,610
So imagine that women
May to cross dominance,

258
00:11:32,611 --> 00:11:35,140
hierarchies end up
socioeconomically speaking,

259
00:11:35,141 --> 00:11:36,810
and on average across cultures,

260
00:11:36,811 --> 00:11:39,180
women go for men who were
about four to five years older,

261
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:39,511
you know,

262
00:11:39,511 --> 00:11:41,550
it varies in the Scandinavian countries,

263
00:11:41,551 --> 00:11:42,600
that's shrunk a little bit,

264
00:11:42,601 --> 00:11:43,620
but not that much.

265
00:11:43,890 --> 00:11:45,360
And in other cultures it's bigger.

266
00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:49,350
I would say that depends to some degree
on difficulty of establishing economic

267
00:11:49,351 --> 00:11:50,184
independence,

268
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:50,731
right?

269
00:11:50,731 --> 00:11:53,860
Because in richer countries it's easier
to have enough economic independence if

270
00:11:53,861 --> 00:11:55,150
you're a male to be,

271
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:59,290
to be a useful participant in
the process of having children.

272
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:00,573
Um,

273
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:01,810
but it doesn't matter.

274
00:12:01,811 --> 00:12:02,561
Cross culturally,

275
00:12:02,561 --> 00:12:05,320
it's still across the nop
were manmade across and down.

276
00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:07,660
They don't care much about
socioeconomic status.

277
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:10,420
Doesn't seem to be part
of their selection method.

278
00:12:10,850 --> 00:12:11,440
Um,

279
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,370
generally speaking.
