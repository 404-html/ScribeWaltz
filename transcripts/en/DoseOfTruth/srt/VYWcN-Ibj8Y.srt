1
00:00:07,130 --> 00:00:07,311
Okay.

2
00:00:07,311 --> 00:00:10,520
So let's talk about Heterodox
Academy because you set that up,

3
00:00:10,521 --> 00:00:15,110
this organization that you should tell
everybody about it precisely to deal with

4
00:00:15,111 --> 00:00:15,591
this issue.

5
00:00:15,591 --> 00:00:16,424
And so I'd like,

6
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:17,690
I'd like to know about,

7
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:18,290
about it,

8
00:00:18,290 --> 00:00:19,130
how it's growing,

9
00:00:19,131 --> 00:00:19,821
what it's doing,

10
00:00:19,821 --> 00:00:20,660
what your aims are,

11
00:00:20,661 --> 00:00:21,271
all of that.

12
00:00:21,271 --> 00:00:21,500
Yeah.

13
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:26,270
So I gave this talk in 2011 laying
out the fact that we have no more

14
00:00:26,271 --> 00:00:30,050
conservatives and social psychology and
why this makes it hard for us to find

15
00:00:30,051 --> 00:00:30,884
truth.

16
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:31,370
And,

17
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:31,640
uh,

18
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:32,720
in the months after that,

19
00:00:32,721 --> 00:00:35,090
a few social psychologists
resonated with the message.

20
00:00:35,091 --> 00:00:35,391
They said,

21
00:00:35,391 --> 00:00:35,661
wow,

22
00:00:35,661 --> 00:00:36,140
I think that,

23
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:36,741
I think you're right.

24
00:00:36,741 --> 00:00:37,574
I have some data on this.

25
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:38,900
So the five of us,

26
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:41,120
six of us,

27
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:41,953
um,

28
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:42,350
uh,

29
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:43,250
wrote this paper.

30
00:00:43,251 --> 00:00:45,410
It came out in behavioral
and brain sciences.

31
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:45,830
Um,

32
00:00:45,830 --> 00:00:46,250
oh,

33
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:46,911
Charlotte is stern.

34
00:00:46,911 --> 00:00:47,151
I'm sorry,

35
00:00:47,151 --> 00:00:48,890
what's the sixth one that
I forgot to add in before?

36
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,033
Um,

37
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:52,370
we got this paper published
and behave and brain sciences.

38
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:53,330
It came out,

39
00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:55,280
it was sort of online in 2014.

40
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:55,790
Uh,

41
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:58,130
but it came out for
good in the summer 2015,

42
00:00:58,370 --> 00:01:01,670
which coincidentally was the same summer
that my article came out with Greg

43
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:03,950
Lukey on off of the coddling
of the American mind.

44
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:06,230
That was about things
going on with undergrads.

45
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:08,480
But our concern was entirely faculty.

46
00:01:08,481 --> 00:01:11,180
It was just the nature of
the academic community,

47
00:01:11,181 --> 00:01:12,050
the research community.

48
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:13,640
So we've got these two things going on.

49
00:01:13,641 --> 00:01:14,870
Summer of 2015.

50
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:15,800
Um,

51
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:19,010
and then that summer I
hear from Nick Rosenkranz,

52
00:01:19,011 --> 00:01:21,890
a law professor who says we
had the same problem in law,

53
00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:23,870
lost worse in law.

54
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:24,201
Well,

55
00:01:24,201 --> 00:01:25,470
it's really bad Canada.

56
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:26,180
Okay.

57
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:26,560
Because,

58
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:27,680
and as he points out,

59
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:29,870
we're training all these students,

60
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:31,820
they never meet a conservative.

61
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,520
Then they have to go argue
cases in front of judges,

62
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:36,710
half of whom were
appointed by Republicans.

63
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:38,720
They have no idea what
a conservative thinks.

64
00:01:38,721 --> 00:01:39,740
This is malpractice.

65
00:01:39,741 --> 00:01:40,401
We got a train.

66
00:01:40,401 --> 00:01:41,130
So,

67
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:42,850
and I hear from a
sociologist Chris Martins,

68
00:01:42,851 --> 00:01:43,970
same thing in sociology.

69
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:45,050
So the three of us said,

70
00:01:45,051 --> 00:01:45,261
hey,

71
00:01:45,261 --> 00:01:45,950
you know,

72
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:47,680
this is a big problem
for the whole account.

73
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:49,610
Have you looked at faculties of education?

74
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:49,771
Oh,

75
00:01:49,771 --> 00:01:50,300
my job.

76
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:51,710
Those are the worst by worst.

77
00:01:51,711 --> 00:01:52,760
I don't know the numbers,

78
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:57,740
but in terms of the vindictiveness
that the incredible pressure put on any

79
00:01:57,741 --> 00:01:58,940
nonconforming opinion.

80
00:01:59,170 --> 00:01:59,600
Um,

81
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,261
my impression,

82
00:02:00,261 --> 00:02:00,741
I don't have data,

83
00:02:00,741 --> 00:02:03,230
but my impression from
the letters I get is that,

84
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:03,560
uh,

85
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:07,550
education schools and social
work schools are the worst.

86
00:02:07,551 --> 00:02:09,170
That's exactly in keeping with my,

87
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,460
my understanding as well,

88
00:02:10,461 --> 00:02:12,460
it's hard to tell which
of those two or worst,

89
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:16,160
I would say it's the faculties
of education because they
have a direct pipeline

90
00:02:16,161 --> 00:02:18,050
to kit and in terms of their effect,

91
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:18,490
yes,

92
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:19,400
farmer pernicious.

93
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:19,790
Yeah,

94
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:19,971
yeah,

95
00:02:19,971 --> 00:02:20,241
that's right.

96
00:02:20,241 --> 00:02:20,450
Yeah.

97
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:20,720
But,

98
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:23,030
but equally equally warped let's say,

99
00:02:23,031 --> 00:02:23,360
but,

100
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,780
but more pernicious and the things that
are happening in the Canadian education

101
00:02:26,781 --> 00:02:29,210
system as a consequence of
that or so reprehensible,

102
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:31,910
we should get to that because
it's happening here too
with these ideas filtered

103
00:02:31,911 --> 00:02:32,744
down to high school.

104
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:36,800
I've been so focused on college now
we're discovering the problem is actually

105
00:02:36,801 --> 00:02:37,401
baked in.

106
00:02:37,401 --> 00:02:40,340
The liberal attitudes are often
baked in by the time they arrived.

107
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:41,600
And purposefully,

108
00:02:41,601 --> 00:02:41,991
like in,

109
00:02:41,991 --> 00:02:42,651
in Canada,

110
00:02:42,651 --> 00:02:44,230
increasingly the,

111
00:02:44,231 --> 00:02:44,630
the,

112
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:47,840
the radical leftists have control over
curriculum development and they're

113
00:02:47,841 --> 00:02:50,150
starting to develop social
justice curriculums,

114
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:54,110
which is what they call
them for kindergarten kids.

115
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:55,340
So it's really,

116
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,770
let's finish up with heterodox academy
that we'll get back to the earlier

117
00:02:57,771 --> 00:02:58,310
grades.

118
00:02:58,310 --> 00:02:58,711
So a,

119
00:02:58,711 --> 00:03:01,300
so originally three of us
decided to put up a website.

120
00:03:01,301 --> 00:03:03,100
I invited all the other authors from the,

121
00:03:03,101 --> 00:03:03,351
the,

122
00:03:03,351 --> 00:03:04,420
the bbs paper.

123
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,370
We invited a few other
people working on this.

124
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:08,780
And so for the first
year we had this project,

125
00:03:08,781 --> 00:03:11,320
it was called heterodoxacademy.org uh,

126
00:03:11,321 --> 00:03:14,020
we put the site up on
about September 10th,

127
00:03:14,021 --> 00:03:19,021
I think it was 2015 and it was just a
community of researchers who are studying

128
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:23,020
the problem of the lack
of viewpoint diversity.

129
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:23,771
Well,

130
00:03:23,771 --> 00:03:24,640
five days later,

131
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:26,530
the protest start at Missouri.

132
00:03:26,531 --> 00:03:31,531
So these are racially motivated protest
or protest about racial insensitivity

133
00:03:32,231 --> 00:03:33,610
and racial problems at Missouri.

134
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:34,720
Um,

135
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,550
and at first it seems like
this is just a Missouri Prom.

136
00:03:36,551 --> 00:03:40,660
But coming in the wake of course of of
Ferguson and all the videos we saw of,

137
00:03:40,661 --> 00:03:43,150
of unarmed black men
being killed by police,

138
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:44,720
the,

139
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,840
a lot of these concerns
spread to other universities.

140
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:48,400
The purchase aren't just about race,

141
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,620
but it was that fall of 2015,

142
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:52,120
especially the Yale protest.

143
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:52,811
Uh,

144
00:03:52,811 --> 00:03:56,500
when the president of Yale validates
their narrative that Yale's are racist

145
00:03:56,501 --> 00:03:56,951
place,

146
00:03:56,951 --> 00:03:58,270
we have to reform Yale.

147
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:58,840
Um,

148
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:02,380
then it spreads nationally and now
suddenly this is not just a faculty issue

149
00:04:02,381 --> 00:04:02,710
anymore.

150
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:03,820
So even though it Heterodox Academy,

151
00:04:03,821 --> 00:04:05,320
we're mostly focused on the faculty,

152
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:09,670
we're now seeing it's a complex ecosystem
with all kinds of forces acting on

153
00:04:09,671 --> 00:04:10,504
universities.

154
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:13,870
So that between 2015 and 2017,

155
00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:18,910
the danger of speaking honestly about
what you think about an academic

156
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:22,930
intellectual proposition has
skyrocketed the risk of being mobbed,

157
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:23,793
ostracized,

158
00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:28,890
formally investigated by title nine
people for Headline People here,

159
00:04:29,201 --> 00:04:30,190
we're sitting here at Nyu,

160
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:31,150
go to any bathroom.

161
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:32,980
I'll show you a on this floor,

162
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:34,000
go to any bathroom.

163
00:04:34,001 --> 00:04:37,990
There's a sign telling students exactly
what number to call to report you or me

164
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:42,550
if we say something that is that
someone takes to be a bias act.

165
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:42,911
Oh,

166
00:04:42,911 --> 00:04:43,870
so you have bias,

167
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:46,030
you have bias investigation teams here.

168
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:46,560
That's right.

169
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:46,751
See,

170
00:04:46,751 --> 00:04:47,980
we haven't gotten to that point,

171
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:49,960
that particular point in Canada yet.

172
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:53,350
So I think we're farther ahead
down that path in some ways,

173
00:04:53,351 --> 00:04:54,750
but not quite as far and others.

174
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:55,091
So yeah,

175
00:04:55,091 --> 00:04:55,691
that's really,

176
00:04:55,691 --> 00:04:56,920
that's really unbelievable.

177
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:57,970
So things are changing very,

178
00:04:57,971 --> 00:04:58,631
very fast.

179
00:04:58,631 --> 00:04:59,890
It's not at all schools.

180
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:00,970
But then again,

181
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:01,960
things are changing so fast.

182
00:05:01,961 --> 00:05:02,531
We don't really know.

183
00:05:02,531 --> 00:05:04,660
We don't have good data
on what's going on.

184
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:08,380
What I can tell you though
is that at Heterodox Academy,

185
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:10,090
when we started out in 2015,

186
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:11,680
there was a lot of suspicion.

187
00:05:11,681 --> 00:05:14,080
A lot of people on the
left were afraid like,

188
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:14,231
oh,

189
00:05:14,231 --> 00:05:15,640
is this some right wing group?

190
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:16,090
Now,

191
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:17,650
very few of us are actually on the right.

192
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:18,370
Um,

193
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:22,690
but because we end up mostly speaking up
for Libertarians and conservatives who

194
00:05:22,691 --> 00:05:24,010
are attacked or silenced,

195
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:24,731
you know,

196
00:05:24,731 --> 00:05:25,391
people will think,

197
00:05:25,391 --> 00:05:25,511
oh,

198
00:05:25,511 --> 00:05:26,291
we must be right wing,

199
00:05:26,291 --> 00:05:26,801
but we're not.

200
00:05:26,801 --> 00:05:27,041
I mean,

201
00:05:27,041 --> 00:05:27,520
I'm,

202
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,200
I've never voted for a
Republican in my life.

203
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,970
I'd never given money
to Republican campaign.

204
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:32,020
Um,

205
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:35,950
I'm now increasingly calling myself a
liberal now that we see illiberalism

206
00:05:35,951 --> 00:05:36,784
flourishing.

207
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:37,690
Um,

208
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:39,010
but so when we started out,

209
00:05:39,011 --> 00:05:43,240
there was a lot of suspicion
of us from many professors,

210
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:45,820
but now that it's clear that the problems,

211
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,380
these are not just a few anecdotes.

212
00:05:47,381 --> 00:05:50,730
This is the new normal and it's
not just in the university.

213
00:05:50,731 --> 00:05:51,520
So as you pointed out,

214
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,353
that's right.

215
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:53,353
It's spreading.

216
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:57,980
And it's not just in the U S it's spread
in 2015 I it was uniquely American

217
00:05:57,981 --> 00:05:58,341
problem.

218
00:05:58,341 --> 00:05:58,700
Yeah.

219
00:05:58,700 --> 00:05:58,960
Employee.

220
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,220
It's in Canada and the UK and Australia.

221
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:02,061
New Zealand.

222
00:06:02,061 --> 00:06:02,420
That's right.

223
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:04,210
It is a uniquely anglosphere problem.

224
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:04,971
This is really interesting.

225
00:06:04,971 --> 00:06:06,560
It's not on the continent
very much at all.

226
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:08,240
What about in the Nordic countries?

227
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:08,720
No,

228
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:09,171
I mean they have,

229
00:06:09,171 --> 00:06:10,940
so political correctness,

230
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:15,970
you have lots of places that unique
thing that identifies this new culture is

231
00:06:16,101 --> 00:06:19,400
linking the political correctness
with the sense of fragility.

232
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:21,470
And this is something America's pioneered,

233
00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:23,030
the idea of that.

234
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:23,721
Um,

235
00:06:23,721 --> 00:06:24,380
so the,

236
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:24,771
in Britain,

237
00:06:24,771 --> 00:06:27,080
they've always had a no platforming.

238
00:06:27,081 --> 00:06:27,860
They call it.

239
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:29,150
So if there's an end,

240
00:06:29,151 --> 00:06:31,880
there was an Afro British national
parties and Actual Fascist party,

241
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:32,271
you know,

242
00:06:32,271 --> 00:06:32,780
so if,

243
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:35,150
if a BNP member is going
to speak on campus,

244
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:36,171
you mob him,

245
00:06:36,171 --> 00:06:36,831
you shut it down,

246
00:06:36,831 --> 00:06:37,340
no Plat,

247
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:38,210
don't give him a platform.

248
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:38,900
So,

249
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:39,051
you know,

250
00:06:39,051 --> 00:06:42,530
you've had passionate politics
certainly since the 60s.

251
00:06:42,531 --> 00:06:43,311
So that's not new.

252
00:06:43,311 --> 00:06:44,144
And that's everywhere.

253
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,200
Um,

254
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:45,800
what's newest,

255
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:50,800
the American idea that if someone says
something and it could be a sincerely

256
00:06:51,021 --> 00:06:51,741
expressed idea,

257
00:06:51,741 --> 00:06:53,150
not a racist rant,

258
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:54,013
just like,

259
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:54,261
well,

260
00:06:54,261 --> 00:06:54,681
I don't know.

261
00:06:54,681 --> 00:06:57,410
I think that maybe hormones
do affect gendered behavior.

262
00:06:58,460 --> 00:06:59,330
Can you say that?

263
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:00,380
Well,

264
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:03,080
what if someone takes that as,

265
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:08,290
as somehow essentially using gender and
then saying that women are inferior or

266
00:07:08,511 --> 00:07:08,841
whatever,

267
00:07:08,841 --> 00:07:11,210
if they know what happened
to James Damore for exactly.

268
00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:11,750
Exactly.

269
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:12,530
Exactly.

270
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:13,310
So,

271
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:14,143
um,

272
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:18,080
so that's what's new is the idea that
if someone says something that someone,

273
00:07:18,081 --> 00:07:21,200
a member of a protected or
marginalized group is offended by,

274
00:07:21,201 --> 00:07:22,610
that person is harmed.

275
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,290
If that person is harmed,

276
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:28,760
we must protect that person and more
ominously just in the last year or two.

277
00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:30,320
It's not just that they're
harming their suffering,

278
00:07:30,321 --> 00:07:31,970
it's that this was violence,

279
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,320
violence.

280
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:33,441
Well,

281
00:07:33,441 --> 00:07:35,470
that's part of the
postmodern narratives that

282
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:37,821
is so dangerous.

283
00:07:37,821 --> 00:07:37,950
The,

284
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:38,231
the,

285
00:07:38,231 --> 00:07:39,530
the crossing the line into,

286
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,393
into violence.

287
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,031
It just occurred to me,

288
00:07:41,031 --> 00:07:41,571
just like yesterday,

289
00:07:41,571 --> 00:07:42,380
I was thinking about this,

290
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:43,130
wait,

291
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:46,040
the state is supposed to
have a monopoly on violence,

292
00:07:46,041 --> 00:07:46,580
right?

293
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:47,900
But if speech,

294
00:07:47,901 --> 00:07:50,150
especially his speech and
her speech and the people,

295
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:53,120
the speech of those people in
that academic movement or on the,

296
00:07:53,121 --> 00:07:54,670
and that if their speeches,

297
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:55,101
violence,

298
00:07:55,101 --> 00:08:00,101
well the state is supposed to have a
monopoly on their speech then and um,

299
00:08:00,290 --> 00:08:01,460
and if it's violence,

300
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:04,580
well then we have a right
to use violence back.

301
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:07,760
The state doesn't have a monopoly
on violence cause our violence is,

302
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:08,410
you know,

303
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:09,350
more and motivated.

304
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:10,650
So just the,

305
00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:14,210
the Orwellian and authoritarian
implications of this move.

306
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:16,550
Once you say that speech is violence,

307
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:17,570
you're unlocking,

308
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,220
you're opening Pandora's box.

309
00:08:19,221 --> 00:08:19,401
I mean,

310
00:08:19,401 --> 00:08:19,580
your,

311
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:21,320
your five steps down the road to hell.

312
00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:23,600
And I'd say we're about seven
steps down the road too.

313
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:24,520
Okay.

314
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:24,700
You,

315
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:25,311
so you're,

316
00:08:25,311 --> 00:08:26,540
you're that concerned about it.
