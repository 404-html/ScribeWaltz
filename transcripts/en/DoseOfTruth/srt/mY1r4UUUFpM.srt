1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:05,140
Hmm excel,
although is a broad term,

2
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:16,430
is only a part of the universe of mental
abilities,

3
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:21,710
so if you are very good at calculating
on what day?

4
00:00:21,711 --> 00:00:24,350
January fifth was in the year,
15,

5
00:00:24,351 --> 00:00:27,530
20.
That's all mental ability that some

6
00:00:27,531 --> 00:00:29,690
people have.
It doesn't mean you're smart,

7
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:31,273
right?
Nice.

8
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:34,670
Fantastic.
Survived so often that they're sad.

9
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:38,150
Often sufficiently.
Often they have these amazing calculus

10
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:40,130
calculation abilities,
for example,

11
00:00:40,131 --> 00:00:45,131
that don't seem to be manifest in a
spectacularly high overall intelligence.
