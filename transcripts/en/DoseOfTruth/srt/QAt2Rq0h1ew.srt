1
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:08,850
So then the first question was,

2
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:13,470
why are these Marxists
motivated by love or hatred?

3
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:15,723
Well,

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,790
is it love or hatred that produces
a hundred million dead people?

5
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:25,790
Is that enough evidence or not?

6
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:27,980
And if it's not enough evidence,

7
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:29,030
if you think to yourself,

8
00:00:29,031 --> 00:00:30,380
well that's not enough evidence.

9
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:32,960
It was never really given its proper,

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,040
a proper try.

11
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:37,971
It's like,

12
00:00:37,971 --> 00:00:40,130
well why would it be in proper try?

13
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:41,211
See,

14
00:00:41,211 --> 00:00:42,890
I always think when I
hear someone say that,

15
00:00:42,891 --> 00:00:44,060
I know what you think.

16
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:47,630
You think in your delusional arrogance,

17
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:52,550
did you understand the Marxist doctrines
better than anyone else ever has?

18
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:55,700
And that if you were the one
implementing those doctrines,

19
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,430
you would have ushered in the utopia.

20
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:01,580
That's what you mean when you say that.

21
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:02,863
And

22
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:06,270
no,

23
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:09,710
they say there's an idea in the
new testament that there's a sin.

24
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:11,420
It's a sin against the holy ghost.

25
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:13,460
If you commit that sand,

26
00:01:13,461 --> 00:01:14,810
no one really knows what it is,

27
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:18,240
that you can't be forgiven.

28
00:01:18,241 --> 00:01:18,811
And I would say,

29
00:01:18,811 --> 00:01:19,644
well,

30
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:24,330
if you want a candidate for
the sin against the Holy
Ghost and the 21st century,

31
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:25,530
uh,

32
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:26,430
the statement

33
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:29,590
communism,

34
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:30,640
real communism,

35
00:01:30,641 --> 00:01:35,410
was never tried with the underlying
idea that if you had been the person

36
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:36,850
implementing it would have worked.

37
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:42,040
I think that's a pretty good contender
for something for which you should never

38
00:01:42,041 --> 00:01:42,874
be forgiven.

39
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:46,993
Yeah.

40
00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:47,701
All right,

41
00:01:47,701 --> 00:01:48,810
so that's Marxism.

42
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:51,030
So let's go on to postmodernism.

43
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:55,430
We talked a little bit about it.
