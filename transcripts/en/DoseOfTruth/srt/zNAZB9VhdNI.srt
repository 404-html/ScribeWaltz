1
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:12,420
What should teaching and research in the
humanities look like?

2
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:17,250
I'm going to Grad School for literature
and I don't want my work to serve the

3
00:00:17,251 --> 00:00:18,570
ideological possession.

4
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:29,570
Well,
the thing is,

5
00:00:29,571 --> 00:00:33,560
first of all is that it kind of have to
educate yourself.

6
00:00:33,561 --> 00:00:37,700
When you go to graduate school,
you know you have your courses,

7
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:42,910
but I don't think that you learn more
than about 10% of what graduate school

8
00:00:44,061 --> 00:00:47,540
can teach you by taking the courses you
have to read.

9
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:52,100
And the mistake that most people read is
make is that they only read what's been

10
00:00:52,101 --> 00:00:56,270
published in the last five or six years
in their own narrow field and that's

11
00:00:56,660 --> 00:00:59,810
increasingly a bad idea.
Um,

12
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:05,950
the libraries are full of classic books
and I would say take your field,

13
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:12,320
go back to the beginning of the field.
At least read the people who wrote the

14
00:01:12,321 --> 00:01:15,620
classic works.
Bring yourself up to date and then

15
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:18,920
familiarize yourself with as much
history,

16
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:22,850
as much history of art,
as much history of literature and

17
00:01:22,851 --> 00:01:24,890
literature as you can possibly manage.

18
00:01:25,610 --> 00:01:28,460
You want to learn as much as you can
about everything.

19
00:01:28,970 --> 00:01:32,330
I would also say you have to ally that
with a certain degree of specialization.

20
00:01:32,331 --> 00:01:34,790
You have to pick one topic and really
become expert at it,

21
00:01:34,791 --> 00:01:38,180
but it'll serve as a doorway to,
because everything's connected,

22
00:01:38,181 --> 00:01:40,220
it'll serve as a doorway to what's
behind it.

23
00:01:40,970 --> 00:01:45,410
So you focus on one thing and read as
much as you can on that.

24
00:01:45,411 --> 00:01:48,110
That's your specific discipline.
Then outside of that,

25
00:01:48,111 --> 00:01:50,210
read as widely as you possibly can
manage.

26
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:51,980
The other thing I would really
recommend,

27
00:01:51,981 --> 00:01:54,050
and this is also true if you're going to
university,

28
00:01:54,051 --> 00:01:58,760
is it isn't enough to read.
You also have to write and if you're

29
00:01:58,761 --> 00:02:01,010
going to go to graduate school,
you should write every day.

30
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:05,120
It's a good idea for anyone who wants to
develop themselves intellectually,

31
00:02:05,121 --> 00:02:07,240
but even half an hour a day,
you know,

32
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:08,840
that's 180 hours a year.

33
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:12,830
That's a lot of thinking because writing
is thinking and you should be writing

34
00:02:12,831 --> 00:02:17,831
out your understanding of what you wrote
or what you read and the questions you

35
00:02:18,111 --> 00:02:22,550
have about it and trying to formulate
what you regard as clear questions and

36
00:02:22,551 --> 00:02:25,120
problems and also clear answers.
Uh,

37
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:28,550
both of those.
And that's how I would say you should

38
00:02:28,551 --> 00:02:32,300
approach graduate school.
Have you thought about slowing down

39
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,950
there?
Were people worried about how hard

40
00:02:33,951 --> 00:02:36,800
you're pushing yourself with the
countless commitments?

41
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:38,931
Yes.
Well,

42
00:02:38,931 --> 00:02:42,170
I would say that those people worried
about that include,

43
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:44,600
ah,
I don't know if it's me,

44
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:47,450
but certainly my family,
they're worried about it,

45
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:52,930
but I'm putting competent people around
me increasingly to handle the scheduling

46
00:02:53,241 --> 00:02:55,100
of the public events,
for example.

47
00:02:55,101 --> 00:02:57,890
And I have good agents in a good
publisher and,

48
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:02,520
um,
I'm learning how to manage this.

49
00:03:02,521 --> 00:03:05,730
I think I've,
I'm not really interested,

50
00:03:05,731 --> 00:03:09,570
I suppose in slowing down,
although it has been a bit much in the

51
00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:11,400
last year and a half.
I'm,

52
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:14,790
I do better in some ways when I'm
working flat out.

53
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:19,790
Uh,
if my health was good,

54
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:22,070
it's better than it was by a large
margin.

55
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:25,370
And maybe it's still getting better.
If my health was good,

56
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:28,850
this,
none of this would be an overwhelming

57
00:03:28,851 --> 00:03:31,940
challenge.
But I'm trying to do everything I can to

58
00:03:31,941 --> 00:03:35,540
put my health in order and many,
many things have been fixed.

59
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:38,840
So,
yeah,

60
00:03:38,841 --> 00:03:42,050
I thought about slowing down,
but I've decided against it I guess is

61
00:03:42,051 --> 00:03:45,740
really the final answer to that.
That's the other thing.

62
00:03:45,741 --> 00:03:49,010
You know there are times in your life
where it's not time to slow down.

63
00:03:49,011 --> 00:03:49,850
It's time to,

64
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:51,190
yeah,

65
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:53,200
become more efficient.
That's the thing.

66
00:03:53,201 --> 00:03:55,540
You can become so efficient,
you know,

67
00:03:55,541 --> 00:03:59,320
you end up doing things in five minutes
that would otherwise take you a week

68
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:01,330
might.
That might seem like an exaggeration,

69
00:04:01,331 --> 00:04:03,370
but,
and I suppose it is to some degree,

70
00:04:03,371 --> 00:04:05,320
but it's not that much of an
exaggeration.

71
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:10,690
So as you take on more responsibilities
and you determine that you're going to

72
00:04:10,691 --> 00:04:13,240
become more efficient,
the responsibility pushes the

73
00:04:13,241 --> 00:04:15,400
efficiency.
So

74
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:21,020
what do they say too?
There's time enough to sleep when you're

75
00:04:21,021 --> 00:04:26,021
in the grave.
Many who respect your work feel your

76
00:04:31,561 --> 00:04:34,590
tweets are often impulsive or even
expedient.

77
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,650
Very funny.
In certain interactions,

78
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:40,560
would you consider a change in the way
you tweet?

79
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:45,720
Well,
I've been considering that for a very

80
00:04:45,721 --> 00:04:48,240
long time.
One of the things I did in the last

81
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,040
month,
which that I think was productive.

82
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:54,360
Twitter's a hard disc,
hard medium to manage because it rewards

83
00:04:54,361 --> 00:04:59,361
impulsivity and uh,
I have somewhat of a temper and I

84
00:04:59,641 --> 00:05:04,641
suspect that it's maybe I'm more
susceptible to being,

85
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:11,010
um,
to being tempted to respond in a

86
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,930
too forceful manner.
Maybe I'm more tempted by that than I

87
00:05:17,931 --> 00:05:19,580
should be.
Um,

88
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:25,270
but Twitter is real useful.
I mean it does keep me updated with

89
00:05:25,271 --> 00:05:27,610
regards to the ongoing,
let's say,

90
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:32,820
war that's raging at the bottom of our
culture and it does enable me to stay in

91
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:36,640
contact with people,
at least to some degree.

92
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:40,000
And it's a great way of communicating,
um,

93
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:45,150
small but at least in principle
important ideas and also to let people

94
00:05:45,911 --> 00:05:50,150
know about what I'm doing on youtube and
with the tours and,

95
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:53,530
and all of that.
People seem to

96
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:58,240
respond positively to those of
notifications.

97
00:05:58,241 --> 00:06:03,241
So what I did do in the last month was
to find people.

98
00:06:03,441 --> 00:06:06,650
I tweeted out one day,
I asked people to send me the Twitter

99
00:06:06,651 --> 00:06:11,651
handles of organizations or individuals
who were reporting on positive

100
00:06:11,691 --> 00:06:14,180
developments in a credible and realistic
way.

101
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:17,150
Human progress.org seems to be doing
that really well.

102
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:22,600
I thought it would be good to tilt my
Twitter feed toward or my Twitter,

103
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:28,010
uh,
my actions towards things that are

104
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:32,660
positive and also true as much as
possible.

105
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:35,570
And so I've started doing that in the
last month.

106
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:40,250
Um,
I feel somewhat of an obligation to,

107
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:47,140
if I'm being discussed publicly by
journalists or,

108
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:52,640
or other professors and they
misrepresent me or misrepresent the

109
00:06:52,641 --> 00:06:55,160
ideas that they're purporting to
discuss,

110
00:06:55,161 --> 00:06:57,710
then I feel like I have a moral
obligation to,

111
00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:04,450
I suppose one is to defend myself,
I suppose,

112
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:10,320
and certainly to object to the miss
utilization of ideas by my fellow

113
00:07:10,761 --> 00:07:12,940
academics.
I don't know if that's a,

114
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,073
yeah,

115
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:18,360
I don't know if that's reasonable or
not.

116
00:07:18,361 --> 00:07:21,390
It's not easy to figure out in a
situation like this,

117
00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:25,260
how much you shut up,
how much you stay patient,

118
00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:28,020
how much you push back,
how much you fight,

119
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:31,740
how,
how firmly you respond,

120
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:36,470
whether or not to use wet
mean.

121
00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:38,480
The rule I tried to outline in,
uh,

122
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:44,150
in my book 12 rules for life.
There's a chapter called,

123
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:46,370
yeah,

124
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:48,740
don't let your children do anything that
makes you dislike them.

125
00:07:48,741 --> 00:07:51,240
And there's a philosophy of discipline
in there and,

126
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:54,920
and it really has two dimensions,
let's say,

127
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:56,750
or two.
It's,

128
00:07:56,751 --> 00:08:01,460
it's at the juncture of two ideas.
One idea is that you don't want to make

129
00:08:01,461 --> 00:08:04,820
any more rules that necessary because
you get tangled up in them.

130
00:08:04,821 --> 00:08:09,320
So minimum necessary rule.
So that's a good guideline for setting

131
00:08:09,321 --> 00:08:13,970
up any structure even in dealing with
yourself.

132
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:18,410
And then if you're going to have rules,
you have to enforce them because

133
00:08:18,411 --> 00:08:23,150
otherwise they're not rules.
And so how do you enforce them with

134
00:08:23,151 --> 00:08:28,151
minimal necessary force?
And some of that has to be played with,

135
00:08:28,971 --> 00:08:30,170
you know,
and experimented with.

136
00:08:30,171 --> 00:08:31,760
So you know,
what minimal force is.

137
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:35,840
Those are really good principles and I
try to govern myself by them in my

138
00:08:35,841 --> 00:08:39,410
Twitter behavior,
but,

139
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:43,430
and I hope that that successful,
um,

140
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:48,410
you know,
sometimes when I've gone after people,

141
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:51,080
I went after a couple of journalists in
Canada last year who

142
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,030
wrote I would,
what I regard as scurrilous and

143
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:00,400
incompetent articles.
That's a bad combination.

144
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:04,920
You know,
it was kind of a harsh exchange I would

145
00:09:04,921 --> 00:09:09,140
say,
but it isn't clear that it was the wrong

146
00:09:09,141 --> 00:09:11,630
thing to do.
So

147
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:18,510
it's hard to know how much you have to
skirt the ragged edge of disaster if you

148
00:09:18,511 --> 00:09:22,920
want to do things right.
So anyways,

149
00:09:22,921 --> 00:09:26,910
I am changing the way I tweet because
I'm trying to make it the bulk of it

150
00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:30,990
informative and positive.
I guess I should say something about

151
00:09:30,991 --> 00:09:31,591
that too.
You know,

152
00:09:31,591 --> 00:09:34,620
there's a lot of really good things
going on in the world.

153
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:40,070
So we have poverty,
absolute poverty between the year 2000

154
00:09:41,461 --> 00:09:45,840
and 2012 which was three years ahead of
what the UN had hoped would happen.

155
00:09:46,810 --> 00:09:47,820
You know,
and cynics say,

156
00:09:47,821 --> 00:09:52,821
well you have the absolute poverty,
but the cutoff was kind of arbitrary.

157
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:56,130
It was a dollar 90 a day,
if I remember correctly,

158
00:09:56,131 --> 00:09:58,620
which obviously is quite low.
Um,

159
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:04,290
so it's not a real transformation.
It's like it's a real transformation.

160
00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:09,000
Some number had to be picked to
represent that absolute poverty.

161
00:10:09,001 --> 00:10:14,001
And I don't suspect the UN erred on the
side of capitalist over optimism.

162
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:19,500
Perhaps they did,
but hundreds of thousands of people are

163
00:10:19,501 --> 00:10:21,570
being connected to the power grid every
day.

164
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:24,900
Fresh water's available,
not to fewer and fewer people,

165
00:10:24,901 --> 00:10:27,390
but to more and more people.
And that's happening extremely rapid,

166
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:31,140
rapidly.
No starvation in India and China is a

167
00:10:31,141 --> 00:10:33,780
thing completely of the past.
You never hear about that.

168
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:37,530
And that's pretty much the case for the
rest of the world except now.

169
00:10:37,531 --> 00:10:41,040
And then for political reasons.
So you know,

170
00:10:41,041 --> 00:10:44,340
everybody's got a cell phone or an oil
on anybody who doesn't,

171
00:10:44,341 --> 00:10:46,080
is going to have one in the next 10
years.

172
00:10:46,081 --> 00:10:50,960
And that puts in people's hands,
uh,

173
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:54,510
a degree of communication and access
that would have been absolutely

174
00:10:54,511 --> 00:10:58,770
incomprehensible even 15 years ago.
So

175
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:03,640
it seems to me that the reason too that
I changed,

176
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:08,230
it seemed to me that it was worthwhile
to change the way that I was using

177
00:11:08,231 --> 00:11:11,410
Twitter because all these good things
are happening

178
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:18,420
and just concentrating on this
polarization process that seems to have

179
00:11:18,951 --> 00:11:22,790
gripped us in the West seems
counterproductive given all those good

180
00:11:22,791 --> 00:11:24,380
things that are going on in the
background.

181
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:29,060
Now that doesn't make what's going on in
the west with regards to political

182
00:11:29,061 --> 00:11:31,220
polarization,
trivial,

183
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:35,120
but it does set it inside a much more
positive context.

184
00:11:35,121 --> 00:11:36,680
So that's something to keep in mind.
