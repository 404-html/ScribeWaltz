1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:00,933
Right

2
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:09,900
David Maxwell,
I scored the Zeros percentile for

3
00:00:09,901 --> 00:00:12,420
conscientious in the 84th for
neuroticism.

4
00:00:12,421 --> 00:00:13,830
How do I improve these scores?
Well,

5
00:00:13,831 --> 00:00:15,840
okay,
so the first thing David you might want

6
00:00:15,841 --> 00:00:18,900
to think about is like if all of your
scores were low,

7
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:22,110
then there's some possibility that
you're being too hard on yourself.

8
00:00:22,111 --> 00:00:26,520
And what I would recommend Danny's get a
couple of friends to fill out the

9
00:00:26,521 --> 00:00:31,260
questionnaire for,
for you to describe you and then see if

10
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:33,320
first of all,
if there's any agreement to see if

11
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:35,280
they've.
They are easier on you than you are

12
00:00:35,281 --> 00:00:36,720
yourself.
So,

13
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:40,440
but let's assume that you are rather low
in conscientiousness.

14
00:00:40,441 --> 00:00:42,450
The next question would be,
well how young are you?

15
00:00:42,451 --> 00:00:45,180
Because younger people tend to be
lowered conscientiousness,

16
00:00:45,181 --> 00:00:48,210
so if you're like 16,
well that's low but it's not

17
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:51,020
catastrophic.
If you're like 40 and you're not

18
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:53,340
depressed and zero is,
you know that's low

19
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:55,823
anyways.

20
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:58,350
If you are that low in
conscientiousness,

21
00:00:58,351 --> 00:01:01,440
one of the things I would recommend is
a,

22
00:01:01,441 --> 00:01:06,441
make a plan and be learn how to use a
schedule a calendar and do it badly to

23
00:01:06,541 --> 00:01:08,130
begin with,
like electronic calendar,

24
00:01:08,131 --> 00:01:10,710
like Google calendar,
that's the best thing I know of,

25
00:01:10,711 --> 00:01:14,070
to improve conscientious,
to make a plan so that you've got

26
00:01:14,071 --> 00:01:19,071
something to a mat and um,
use a scheduler and maybe you have to,

27
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:23,070
you know,
talk to someone to help keep you on

28
00:01:23,071 --> 00:01:25,530
track.
Now the other question would be,

29
00:01:25,531 --> 00:01:28,410
do you have other personality traits
that are really high,

30
00:01:28,411 --> 00:01:31,110
like openness because if you're really
high in openness,

31
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:35,400
then it might be that you're more
inclined towards being motivated by

32
00:01:35,401 --> 00:01:38,280
spontaneous interest and in the artistic
direction.

33
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:39,880
And if you're really high in
extroversion,

34
00:01:39,881 --> 00:01:42,440
then you're going to be motivated by
being around people you know.

35
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:46,530
So it also may be that in order to be
conscientious about something,

36
00:01:46,531 --> 00:01:50,970
you have to pick a domain that you're
suited to like socializing or artistic

37
00:01:50,971 --> 00:01:54,900
endeavor and try to work on being
conscientious in those domains.

38
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,610
So that's it.
