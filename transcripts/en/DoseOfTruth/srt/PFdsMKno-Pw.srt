1
00:00:06,730 --> 00:00:07,440
Yeah.

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:08,940
You Josh Gates.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:09,451
Oh good.

4
00:00:09,451 --> 00:00:10,284
Josh,

5
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:11,490
ask me an easy question.

6
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:16,820
Young suggested that the Christian Myth
failed to articulate Christ descended

7
00:00:17,241 --> 00:00:21,840
into hell and that this resulted in
the mass shadow projection of the West.

8
00:00:21,841 --> 00:00:22,674
Thoughts?

9
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:28,363
Yeah.

10
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:29,690
Well,

11
00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:31,250
I'm going to refer to my book again.

12
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:33,230
I talked about this and rule seven,

13
00:00:33,231 --> 00:00:34,550
pursue what is meaningful,

14
00:00:34,551 --> 00:00:35,690
not what is expedient.

15
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:41,080
In that Chapter I discussed there's this
idea in Christianity that Christ took

16
00:00:41,601 --> 00:00:45,590
the sins of the world onto himself and
I think that's very much related to the

17
00:00:45,591 --> 00:00:47,330
idea of descent into hell.

18
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:51,460
They're not exactly the same thing,

19
00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:52,870
but I,

20
00:00:52,870 --> 00:00:56,920
but I'm going to address the first one
and it will shed light on the second.

21
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:01,600
So what does it mean that
the Messiah is archetype Lee?

22
00:01:01,601 --> 00:01:05,080
The figure who takes the sins
of the world onto himself,

23
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:09,970
what it means practically speaking
or psychologically speaking.

24
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,940
And I've tried this with some of
my clients who were very naive.

25
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:18,310
It means to read the history of the world
as if you were the perpetrator of the

26
00:01:18,311 --> 00:01:22,630
evils that you read about instead of
the victim or the noble intervener.

27
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:23,733
You know,

28
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,710
I talked to somebody the other day
about the movie Schindler's List and

29
00:01:26,711 --> 00:01:30,580
Schindler was this German industrialist
who saved a very large number of Jews

30
00:01:30,581 --> 00:01:32,950
that were in danger of well endanger of,

31
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:33,430
of,

32
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:34,240
of,

33
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,470
of the final solution.

34
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:37,450
And one of the things he said was,

35
00:01:37,451 --> 00:01:37,691
well,

36
00:01:37,691 --> 00:01:37,931
you know,

37
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:39,400
when people watch Schindler's list,

38
00:01:39,401 --> 00:01:42,880
they always think they'd be Schindler
and on if they don't think they'd be

39
00:01:42,881 --> 00:01:43,301
Schindler,

40
00:01:43,301 --> 00:01:45,940
maybe they think they'd be the
Jewish victim of the Nazis,

41
00:01:45,941 --> 00:01:49,060
but they almost never think that
they'd be the Nazi persecutor.

42
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:52,870
And that's a big mistake because
when you read about history,

43
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:56,140
then you're reading about you,

44
00:01:56,770 --> 00:01:59,380
even if the you is the perpetrator.

45
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:01,420
And unless you understand that,

46
00:02:01,421 --> 00:02:03,460
then someone else has
to be the perpetrator.

47
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:05,770
And if someone else is the perpetrator,

48
00:02:05,771 --> 00:02:08,890
well then you have a devil that
you can chase and you know,

49
00:02:08,891 --> 00:02:12,640
maybe you've identified the devil properly
because you know now and then it's

50
00:02:12,641 --> 00:02:15,850
like John Wayne Gacy or Ted
Bundy or someone like that.

51
00:02:15,851 --> 00:02:16,541
And you've actually,

52
00:02:16,541 --> 00:02:16,781
you know,

53
00:02:16,781 --> 00:02:18,310
you've identified the perpetrator.

54
00:02:18,311 --> 00:02:19,580
But so often,

55
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:21,400
okay,

56
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,540
far too often

57
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:27,340
the best way to constrain the
malevolence outside is to constrain the

58
00:02:27,341 --> 00:02:28,350
malevolence within.

59
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:32,410
And so if you don't have a locale for
the evil of the world and you have to

60
00:02:32,411 --> 00:02:35,950
externalize it because the evil
of the world certainly exists now,

61
00:02:35,951 --> 00:02:40,951
it's a better solution to assume that your

62
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:48,820
fully capable of the terrible things
that people have been capable of throat,

63
00:02:48,821 --> 00:02:49,990
the history of humanity,

64
00:02:49,991 --> 00:02:52,120
and to contend with that genuinely.

65
00:02:52,121 --> 00:02:54,400
And there's massive advantages to that.

66
00:02:54,401 --> 00:02:54,641
I mean,

67
00:02:54,641 --> 00:02:55,121
first of all,

68
00:02:55,121 --> 00:03:00,121
it can actually produce and remarkable
increment self esteem because you know,

69
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:05,530
if you're just a rabbit and you
freeze whenever a wolf looks at you,

70
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,870
then you're just a frozen
rabbit and that's not so good.

71
00:03:07,871 --> 00:03:08,980
You're just a scared rabbit.

72
00:03:08,981 --> 00:03:12,310
But maybe you learn one day that
you're not a rabbit that you like,

73
00:03:12,311 --> 00:03:15,160
you're actually quite the damn monster
and you've got teeth and you could really

74
00:03:15,161 --> 00:03:17,050
use them in an underhanded
and horrible way.

75
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:21,790
This is why people like anti hero movie
so much hay because they go and see the

76
00:03:21,791 --> 00:03:22,331
villains,

77
00:03:22,331 --> 00:03:26,350
the mafia guys and these tough guys
and they antiheroes that populate our

78
00:03:26,351 --> 00:03:27,460
imagination and think,

79
00:03:27,461 --> 00:03:27,940
oh yeah,

80
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:30,310
well I'd really read it like
to be someone like that.

81
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:31,270
And the thing is,

82
00:03:31,271 --> 00:03:33,280
is that being useless and week,

83
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:36,220
it's better to be a monster
then to be useless and weak.

84
00:03:36,221 --> 00:03:39,400
And that's because being useless and
weak makes you a worst monster then a

85
00:03:39,401 --> 00:03:39,940
monster.

86
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:42,580
That's why it's not like
being a monster is good,

87
00:03:42,581 --> 00:03:43,420
but weak,

88
00:03:43,421 --> 00:03:46,840
useless monster is the worst kind of
monster because that's a sort of monster.

89
00:03:46,841 --> 00:03:50,830
A little jump in the dark and sink its
teeth into the back of your neck instead

90
00:03:50,831 --> 00:03:53,020
of confronting you
forthrightly in the alley.

91
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:57,250
And so if you start to see yourself
as the perpetrator of historical

92
00:03:57,251 --> 00:03:57,881
malevolence,

93
00:03:57,881 --> 00:03:58,091
you know,

94
00:03:58,091 --> 00:04:00,640
if you can imagine yourself
as an Auschwitz camp guard,

95
00:04:00,641 --> 00:04:02,440
if you see yourself as,

96
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:03,310
as the,

97
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:03,720
the,

98
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:06,010
the vicious villain of the human story,

99
00:04:06,011 --> 00:04:08,680
then all of a sudden you've got a lot
more respect for yourself and you can

100
00:04:08,681 --> 00:04:11,590
unlock that internal monster
and not internal monster.

101
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:14,770
And then maybe you can tame the
damn thing or at least bring it in,

102
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:17,170
bring it into some sort of
partnership with yourself.

103
00:04:17,171 --> 00:04:18,700
And then when someone pushes you around,

104
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:22,630
you can let a little bit of that out in
your eyes just a little bit and you can

105
00:04:22,631 --> 00:04:24,700
say it would be better for you.

106
00:04:24,701 --> 00:04:28,060
And for me if you didn't continue to
do that and you can actually mean it.

107
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:32,080
And then actually it will stop because
if you let a little bit of that out when

108
00:04:32,081 --> 00:04:33,280
you tell someone to stop,

109
00:04:33,281 --> 00:04:35,770
the probability that they'll
stop is extremely high.

110
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:41,130
And then just a tiny like vision of the
monster you could become is enough to

111
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:42,730
keep order in your house.

112
00:04:42,731 --> 00:04:42,881
Hey,

113
00:04:42,881 --> 00:04:43,990
and maybe in your state.

114
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:48,130
And so the mass shadow
projection of the West,

115
00:04:48,131 --> 00:04:48,401
well,

116
00:04:48,401 --> 00:04:49,234
you know,

117
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:50,680
here's another thing.

118
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:53,590
So one of the things the
Christians figured out was that,

119
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,233
um,

120
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:58,330
the snake in the garden
of Eden was also Satan.

121
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:00,130
I can't get into that.

122
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:01,390
It's too complicated.

123
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:05,800
You'll have to read chapter seven if you
want a full explication of that idea.

124
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:06,370
I,

125
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:08,950
that's as good an answer as to
the question as I can manage.

126
00:05:08,951 --> 00:05:09,784
Tonight,

127
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,020
I spent all day,

128
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:12,370
let's see,

129
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:12,821
all day.

130
00:05:12,821 --> 00:05:16,930
I got up at seven and I worked all day
till five on this video I told you about.

131
00:05:16,931 --> 00:05:19,330
So I made about 400 anets
or something like that.

132
00:05:19,331 --> 00:05:21,790
So I'm a little bit on
the burnt outside tonight,

133
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:23,020
so.
