1
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:03,970
So you've been an educator through
the rise of the smartphone.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,530
And my question basically relates
to procrastination and task delay,

3
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:14,010
needless task delay specifically
and given the unprecedented level of

4
00:00:14,171 --> 00:00:16,330
distraction that we have in today's world.

5
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:21,450
I just wanted to get your perspective
from a psychological standpoint on other

6
00:00:21,551 --> 00:00:23,020
than cleaning your damn room,

7
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:27,010
what would you suggest to a student
who's looking to overcome these things?

8
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:30,461
Well,

9
00:00:30,461 --> 00:00:31,600
I think with any,

10
00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:33,580
let's call it an addictive process.

11
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,030
I mean emails powerfully addictive,

12
00:00:37,031 --> 00:00:37,530
right?

13
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:38,170
Hardly it's,

14
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:40,540
it's a slot machine and
I mean that technically.

15
00:00:40,541 --> 00:00:41,390
So when you pull,

16
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:44,890
that's a variable ratio
reinforcement schedule,

17
00:00:44,891 --> 00:00:45,850
if I remember correctly.

18
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:50,890
And it's very addictive because if you
pour on the slot machine arm enough,

19
00:00:50,891 --> 00:00:55,891
you will win and you never know
which pole will reward you.

20
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:58,900
And so not only is that addictive,

21
00:00:58,901 --> 00:01:01,090
it's very hard to extinguish that.

22
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:02,613
And so

23
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:06,880
emails like that because there's always
something beckoning and now and then

24
00:01:06,881 --> 00:01:07,750
it's a jackpot.

25
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:11,140
And social media is like
that because you know,

26
00:01:11,141 --> 00:01:16,141
people are posting interesting things
and so well how do you overcome an

27
00:01:16,151 --> 00:01:17,140
addictive process?

28
00:01:17,141 --> 00:01:20,440
And partly you do it by replacing
it with something better.

29
00:01:21,370 --> 00:01:21,730
Right?

30
00:01:21,730 --> 00:01:25,720
So when people study drug and alcohol use,

31
00:01:25,721 --> 00:01:27,610
they often make an elementary mistake,

32
00:01:27,611 --> 00:01:30,670
which is to try to figure out
why people use drugs and alcohol.

33
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:31,420
That's,

34
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:35,140
that's not a smart thing to wonder.

35
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:37,450
We know why people use cocaine.

36
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:42,870
Cocaine directly stimulates the
systems that produce positive emotion.

37
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:44,201
It's like,

38
00:01:44,201 --> 00:01:45,400
so there's no mystery there.

39
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:47,230
The mystery with cocaine is very,

40
00:01:47,231 --> 00:01:48,064
very simple.

41
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:51,040
Why don't people take cocaine
all the time until they die?

42
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:52,540
That's the mystery really.

43
00:01:52,541 --> 00:01:55,060
Cause you can get
isolated rats to do that.

44
00:01:55,061 --> 00:01:55,770
So,

45
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:56,100
and,

46
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:57,310
and for some people,

47
00:01:57,311 --> 00:02:00,880
alcohol has the same kind of effect
except it's mediated by opiates.

48
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:05,100
But often what people have to do to get
themselves out of an addictive process

49
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:08,110
is to find something
better to do to replace it.

50
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:11,230
And so I would say the
problem with the gadgets,

51
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:16,500
I mean there are amazing things is that
they interfere with the proximately

52
00:02:17,651 --> 00:02:20,140
interfere with medium to longterm goals,

53
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:21,003
I would say.

54
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:24,430
And so I think the first thing you have
to do to bring them under control is

55
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:27,370
figure out what it is that
their use is interfering with.

56
00:02:27,371 --> 00:02:28,680
It has to be something important,

57
00:02:28,681 --> 00:02:28,860
right?

58
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:29,321
So you think,

59
00:02:29,321 --> 00:02:29,690
well,

60
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:31,570
I want to do something important.

61
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:32,783
What is that?

62
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,300
Or it could be personal.

63
00:02:34,301 --> 00:02:35,740
Maybe you want to have a relationship.

64
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:36,843
You want to get married,

65
00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:37,870
you want to have kids,

66
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:40,210
you want to have a
career that's meaningful.

67
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:40,451
You know,

68
00:02:40,451 --> 00:02:41,284
you want to have a life,

69
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:45,160
you want to have an Abrahamic
adventure and be the father of nations,

70
00:02:45,161 --> 00:02:45,521
let's say.

71
00:02:45,521 --> 00:02:45,601
Well,

72
00:02:45,601 --> 00:02:48,670
you can't be ratting away on
your cell phone and doing that.

73
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,290
And so I think,

74
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:55,620
I think part of it is to set your sights
high ed and make a plan and figure out

75
00:02:56,381 --> 00:03:01,381
who you could be and see if obsessive
utilization of smart phone fits into that

76
00:03:02,951 --> 00:03:04,120
vision of nobility.

77
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:05,261
And it will,

78
00:03:05,261 --> 00:03:06,160
partly because they're,

79
00:03:06,161 --> 00:03:08,710
they're unbelievably powerful
communication devices.

80
00:03:08,711 --> 00:03:09,630
But so,

81
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:10,690
so often it's,

82
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:15,760
it's for lack of something better
to do and it also interferes.

83
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,220
So that's about the
best I can do with that.
