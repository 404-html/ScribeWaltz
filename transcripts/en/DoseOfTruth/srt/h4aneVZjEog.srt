1
00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:12,750
Agreeable young woman to
be more disagreeable and
assertive if that isn't how

2
00:00:13,001 --> 00:00:14,980
she is temperamentally inclined.

3
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:15,641
Oh,

4
00:00:15,641 --> 00:00:16,480
that's a good question.

5
00:00:16,481 --> 00:00:17,710
And I would say first of all,

6
00:00:17,711 --> 00:00:22,711
that's a very common question that
people who go into psychotherapy ask.

7
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:28,050
I think the most common problem that
psychotherapists deal with apart from

8
00:00:28,751 --> 00:00:32,140
anxiety and depression is
probably assertiveness training.

9
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:33,550
Um,

10
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:37,720
so the first thing I would say is you
really need to figure out what you want.

11
00:00:38,410 --> 00:00:41,560
And I would recommend doing
the self authoring program,

12
00:00:41,561 --> 00:00:44,740
the future authoring program in particular
because if you want to stand up for

13
00:00:44,741 --> 00:00:45,520
yourself,

14
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:50,520
you have to have your goals and your
vision well laid out and well defined.

15
00:00:51,011 --> 00:00:52,870
And then you have to have a strategy,

16
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:53,800
um,

17
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:57,430
that that is matched to
those goals so that you can,

18
00:00:58,570 --> 00:01:02,270
so that you know what you want so that
you know when you're not getting it it

19
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:06,550
otherwise you're left with a vague
sense of dissatisfaction and resentment.

20
00:01:06,550 --> 00:01:07,121
And that's very,

21
00:01:07,121 --> 00:01:08,770
very difficult thing to articulate.

22
00:01:08,771 --> 00:01:10,450
And if you can't articulate it,

23
00:01:10,451 --> 00:01:11,710
then you can't negotiate.

24
00:01:12,190 --> 00:01:14,230
If you know what you
want and you know why,

25
00:01:14,470 --> 00:01:16,240
then you can make a case for yourself.

26
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:16,601
Okay.

27
00:01:16,601 --> 00:01:20,500
So let's assume now that you've laid
out a vision and a counter vision,

28
00:01:20,501 --> 00:01:22,750
which the future authoring
program also helps you do.

29
00:01:22,751 --> 00:01:26,710
So you know what kind of hell you want
to avoid that you might drift into if you

30
00:01:26,711 --> 00:01:28,600
were to agreeable for
the rest of your life.

31
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:32,410
And that would be a hell that consisted
mostly of people taking advantage of you

32
00:01:32,411 --> 00:01:34,810
all the time and you feeling
resentful and bitter about it.

33
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:36,550
Not something I would recommend.

34
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:37,570
Um,

35
00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:37,841
see,

36
00:01:37,841 --> 00:01:42,841
I think that women are agreeable
because it helps them deal with infants,

37
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:48,300
but it's not a great temperamental
strategy for dealing with complex,

38
00:01:48,910 --> 00:01:49,743
um,

39
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:51,100
organizations in,

40
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:52,330
in the adult world.

41
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:54,130
So I think it's a price
that women pay for.

42
00:01:54,131 --> 00:01:58,360
Also being adapted to have plenty
of patients for very young children.

43
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:03,400
And then you have to overcome that to
some degree to put yourself forward

44
00:02:03,401 --> 00:02:06,940
properly in more complex
hierarchies of accomplishment.

45
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:11,080
So I would say once you have
your vision established,

46
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:13,120
your vision for the future
and your counter vision,

47
00:02:13,121 --> 00:02:14,590
so you're afraid of what will happen.

48
00:02:14,591 --> 00:02:16,030
If you don't stand up for yourself,

49
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:19,120
then you need to consult
your resentment fic.

50
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:20,980
Because if you're
resentful about something,

51
00:02:20,981 --> 00:02:21,940
as far as I can tell,

52
00:02:21,941 --> 00:02:23,620
there's generally only two reasons.

53
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:26,800
One is you should grow the
hell up and quit whining,

54
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,180
so you've got to find out first.

55
00:02:28,181 --> 00:02:31,600
If you're just feeling sorry for
yourself and you can think that through,

56
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:35,200
make a pro and con case and you can talk
to somebody that you care about about

57
00:02:35,201 --> 00:02:35,590
that.

58
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:37,750
I'm not assuming that that's the reason,

59
00:02:37,751 --> 00:02:39,130
but that's one potential reason.

60
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:42,160
If you're not merely
feeling sorry for yourself,

61
00:02:42,161 --> 00:02:46,030
then you probably have something to say
and something that you need and you need

62
00:02:46,031 --> 00:02:49,660
to figure out what that is and then you
have to develop a strategy to to put

63
00:02:49,661 --> 00:02:50,494
that forward.

64
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:55,740
I've seen lots of people in my personal
life and in my private practice not get

65
00:02:56,411 --> 00:02:57,820
what they want because well a,

66
00:02:57,821 --> 00:03:00,640
they don't specify it and
they don't ask for it.

67
00:03:00,641 --> 00:03:05,350
And if you're negotiating save for a
raise or for a promotion and so forth,

68
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:06,760
you have to put yourself forward.

69
00:03:06,761 --> 00:03:09,400
You need to tell your the
person you're working for,

70
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:14,640
why you should be treated with more
consideration or respect or have more

71
00:03:14,831 --> 00:03:17,260
resources devoted to
you or more authority.

72
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:18,280
Um,

73
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,510
what shifted to you?

74
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:21,650
And you have to make a case for that.

75
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:25,090
A compelling case so that they
have a reason to attend to you.

76
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:27,160
And that's not good.

77
00:03:27,161 --> 00:03:30,880
They're not going to notice because most
managerial types are so overloaded with

78
00:03:30,881 --> 00:03:33,550
work that they never noticed
when anything's going right.

79
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:36,310
They just notice the things
that are going wrong.

80
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:38,200
So you need to make a plan,

81
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:41,200
you have to have a strategy
that goes along with that plan.

82
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:46,380
You have to have articulated arguments
for why certain a certain form of

83
00:03:46,511 --> 00:03:48,640
treatment is appropriate to you.

84
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:51,670
And then you have to have the
courage to put that forward.

85
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:57,130
And I guess you have to remember that
you owe yourself as much as you owe other

86
00:03:57,131 --> 00:03:57,730
people.

87
00:03:57,730 --> 00:03:58,960
You have to take care of yourself,

88
00:03:58,961 --> 00:04:01,240
like you take care of other people and,

89
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:04,000
and that's a moral duty
and if you practice that,

90
00:04:04,001 --> 00:04:04,834
you can do it.

91
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:05,913
And a lot of that,

92
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:08,560
a lot of that is also associated
with telling the truth.

93
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:08,831
You know,

94
00:04:08,831 --> 00:04:10,690
you don't have a better
friend than the truth,

95
00:04:10,691 --> 00:04:12,640
even though it can be very
harsh in the short term.

96
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:16,900
And so if you're unhappy at work
because you're being taken advantage of,

97
00:04:16,901 --> 00:04:19,510
then you have to strategize yourself
out of that and you have to learn to

98
00:04:19,511 --> 00:04:20,344
negotiate.

99
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:24,850
And a lot of that also means that you
have to overcome your hesitancy to engage

100
00:04:24,851 --> 00:04:25,684
in conflict.

101
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:27,340
And you've got to think about it this way.

102
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:34,050
Negotiation and conflict are somewhat
indistinguishable and it's easy moment to

103
00:04:35,801 --> 00:04:37,900
moment to avoid negotiation conflict,

104
00:04:37,901 --> 00:04:40,600
but you pay a terrible price for
it in the medium to long term.

105
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:45,690
It's better to face the
conflict forthrightly in the
present and make peace for

106
00:04:46,631 --> 00:04:47,770
the medium to long term.

107
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,450
And that there's courage in that.

108
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:53,560
So that's the other thing I would
say is gird up your loins and,

109
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:54,430
and,

110
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:55,240
and,

111
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:58,690
and allow yourself to act courageously,

112
00:04:59,080 --> 00:04:59,680
courageously.

113
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,513
And truthfully,

114
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:02,950
truth is your best bet
if you're too agreeable.

115
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:04,210
So you know,

116
00:05:04,211 --> 00:05:06,850
you also might find that you have a
pretty good critical intelligence,

117
00:05:06,851 --> 00:05:09,750
but that you think it's mean
and so that you keep it hidden.

118
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,920
Some of the smartest women
I knew who were very,

119
00:05:11,921 --> 00:05:16,900
very agreeable had unbelievably
good instincts with regards
to figuring out what

120
00:05:16,901 --> 00:05:18,250
other people's motives were,

121
00:05:18,251 --> 00:05:21,040
but they were ashamed of their suspicions.

122
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:24,280
And really what that meant was they
ended up being ashamed of their critical

123
00:05:24,281 --> 00:05:26,230
intelligence because
they were so agreeable.

124
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:29,350
So it may be that the darker part of you,

125
00:05:29,351 --> 00:05:32,590
the shadow part of you knows things that
you could know if you are willing to

126
00:05:32,591 --> 00:05:33,700
admit that they were true.

127
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:36,670
And so you have to give
some credence to your,

128
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:38,860
to your darker element,

129
00:05:38,861 --> 00:05:39,694
I would say.

130
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:58,610
How do you know if you were communicating
with the actual person or a mask?

131
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:01,460
I sometimes wonder if I can
ever really know someone.

132
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:02,773
Well,

133
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:06,800
you can't ever thoroughly know someone
because people are too complicated.

134
00:06:06,801 --> 00:06:08,660
You can't even really know yourself.

135
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:12,020
How do you know if you're communicating
with the actual person or a mask?

136
00:06:12,021 --> 00:06:12,710
Well,

137
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:14,780
if you're communicating
with an actual person,

138
00:06:14,781 --> 00:06:16,730
then you're actually
having a conversation,

139
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:17,481
you know,

140
00:06:17,481 --> 00:06:22,100
and the conversation transforms as a
consequence of participating in it and it

141
00:06:22,101 --> 00:06:24,200
tends to be engaging in meaningful.

142
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:29,300
If what's happening is an exchange
of ideological platitudes or or just

143
00:06:29,301 --> 00:06:31,460
platitudes themselves for that matter,

144
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:33,800
then you probably engaging with the mask.

145
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:39,050
So if the conversation is compelling and
meaningful and it transforms as it as

146
00:06:39,051 --> 00:06:43,550
it progresses and and you can see that
give and take that dance like give and

147
00:06:43,551 --> 00:06:43,881
take,

148
00:06:43,881 --> 00:06:46,310
then you're communicating
with an actual person.

149
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:50,210
The other thing I would say is that
when you're communicating with an actual

150
00:06:50,211 --> 00:06:51,620
person rather than a mask,

151
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,760
that person that you're communicating
with tends to be quite interesting.

152
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:56,601
You know,

153
00:06:56,601 --> 00:06:58,670
if people talk about what they know,

154
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:00,740
which means you really
communicating with them.

155
00:07:00,741 --> 00:07:05,741
If they talk about their own personal
experience instead of wandering off into

156
00:07:05,811 --> 00:07:09,050
the domain of cliches and
ideological platitudes,

157
00:07:09,051 --> 00:07:11,810
then people tend to be
extraordinarily interesting.

158
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:17,260
And so that's another good tactic
and a good hint that you're,

159
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,340
that you're where you should
be when you're conversing.

160
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:24,760
One of the rules I had when I was
seeing clients actively was that if the

161
00:07:25,251 --> 00:07:27,740
conversation I was having
wasn't interesting,

162
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,630
and if my attention started to wonder,

163
00:07:29,631 --> 00:07:34,340
then we weren't discussing issues that
were sufficiently vital because if we

164
00:07:34,341 --> 00:07:35,990
were discussing vital issues,

165
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:39,140
then the conversation basically flew by,

166
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:40,820
and so I think that's a good,

167
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:42,020
that's a good marker.
