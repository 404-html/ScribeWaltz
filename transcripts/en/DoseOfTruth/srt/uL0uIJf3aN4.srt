1
00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:13,080
So we should think about
the hypothalamus forget,

2
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:15,090
because it seems to be
pretty damn important.

3
00:00:15,091 --> 00:00:15,924
Consult,

4
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:16,890
I would say,

5
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:18,330
you know,

6
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:20,490
people have wondered sometimes
when they've asked me,

7
00:00:20,491 --> 00:00:20,701
you know,

8
00:00:20,701 --> 00:00:24,420
where's the Super Ego and the ego
and the Ed located in the brain.

9
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:25,470
And you know,

10
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:29,520
it's a stupid question and
it's not a stupid question.

11
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:30,510
At the same time,

12
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:31,663
um,

13
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:35,520
it's actually a useful question at one
level of analysis because you could say,

14
00:00:35,521 --> 00:00:36,120
well,

15
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:39,070
the end from the [inaudible]
perspective is sort of the,

16
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:42,840
the natural force that propels motivation.

17
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:43,620
You know,

18
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:44,190
and,

19
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:45,000
and it's,

20
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,320
when we say motivation,

21
00:00:46,321 --> 00:00:49,650
we're not saying much
different than saying in,

22
00:00:49,651 --> 00:00:50,250
by the way,

23
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:50,461
you know,

24
00:00:50,461 --> 00:00:53,250
it's the same kind of low resolution work.

25
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:56,910
And it's clearly the case that we have
fundamental motivational systems and that

26
00:00:56,911 --> 00:01:00,600
we do share them with animals and
that they do drive our behavior.

27
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:05,160
But they also drive our perceptions in
all the ways that Freud thought about,

28
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:05,581
you know,

29
00:01:05,581 --> 00:01:09,800
and one of the things I really like
about the psychoanalysts is that they,

30
00:01:09,801 --> 00:01:10,500
they,

31
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:15,000
they never make the mistake of assuming
that a motivational system or an

32
00:01:15,001 --> 00:01:20,001
emotional system is a mechanical system
that reacts to deterministically.

33
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:21,841
They say no,

34
00:01:21,841 --> 00:01:23,700
those things are like personalities.

35
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:24,330
And that's,

36
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:28,920
that's much more sophisticated viewpoint
than the typical behaviorist or the

37
00:01:28,921 --> 00:01:31,080
typical cognitive psychologist,

38
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:32,190
you know,

39
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:36,330
because they tend to think of the computer
in either stimulus response terms.

40
00:01:36,331 --> 00:01:40,380
So it's basically deterministic
chains or as if the,

41
00:01:40,381 --> 00:01:40,760
the,

42
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:45,390
the information processing system
is a computational apparatus,

43
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:46,500
which it is.

44
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,090
But it's not only that,

45
00:01:48,091 --> 00:01:48,331
you know,

46
00:01:48,331 --> 00:01:53,070
it's an embodied computational apparatus
and the body is a very sophisticated

47
00:01:53,071 --> 00:01:53,790
thing.

48
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:54,001
You know,

49
00:01:54,001 --> 00:01:54,211
it's,

50
00:01:54,211 --> 00:01:56,880
it's been very difficult for
us to build embodied robots.

51
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:00,270
And it's also the case that
until you build in body robots,

52
00:02:00,271 --> 00:02:01,980
the things don't really get smart,

53
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:02,910
you know?

54
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:03,190
Yeah.

55
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:06,540
You have to have a body for the thing
to actually have any intelligence.

56
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:10,020
And that was actually figured out by a
robotics engineer named Rodney Brooks

57
00:02:10,021 --> 00:02:14,490
back in the 1990s 92 93 published
a couple of papers on that saying,

58
00:02:14,491 --> 00:02:14,731
you know,

59
00:02:14,731 --> 00:02:16,920
that if we were going to
build artificial intelligence,

60
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:19,350
we shouldn't start from the top down.

61
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:22,590
We shouldn't build a
world modeling machine.

62
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:25,320
And then embedded in
something that moves around,

63
00:02:25,321 --> 00:02:28,440
we should build something that sort
of moves around semi autonomously,

64
00:02:28,441 --> 00:02:29,790
like a stupid insect.

65
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:31,530
Insects aren't stupid.

66
00:02:31,531 --> 00:02:35,250
So I do mean as stupid insect
and if we could manage that,

67
00:02:35,251 --> 00:02:36,720
we'd really be doing something,

68
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:37,381
you know,

69
00:02:37,381 --> 00:02:38,214
and I think we've,

70
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:41,100
we might've gotten beyond
the stupid insect level of,

71
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,540
of robots so far.

72
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:43,680
Um,

73
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,281
and you know,

74
00:02:44,281 --> 00:02:45,960
it's starting to ramp up really fast,

75
00:02:45,961 --> 00:02:48,360
but it's in large part because
the things are embodied.

76
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:51,040
And so because it is the case as,

77
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:52,080
as we've discussed,

78
00:02:52,081 --> 00:02:53,250
that your,

79
00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:54,780
your perceptual,

80
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:59,810
your cognitive perceptual motor systems
have to be embedded in an output system

81
00:02:59,971 --> 00:03:03,660
that can interact with the world in order
for them to be doing anything that's

82
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:04,920
actual or real.
