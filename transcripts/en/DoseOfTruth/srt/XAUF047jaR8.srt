1
00:00:06,670 --> 00:00:09,970
I am guilty of overusing
the word brilliant.

2
00:00:10,270 --> 00:00:11,470
It diminishes its value.

3
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:12,401
However,

4
00:00:12,401 --> 00:00:16,810
if there was one person walking the
earth today who is truly brilliant,

5
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:18,970
it is Dr. Jordan B.

6
00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:19,570
Peterson.

7
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:22,090
It would not be a stretch
to assume history.

8
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:23,940
We'll lump him in with soccer days,

9
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:25,210
Freud and young.

10
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:29,110
If you haven't yet gone
down the JBP rabbit hole,

11
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:30,880
you may think I'm being hyperbolic,

12
00:00:30,881 --> 00:00:34,720
but I assure you everything
you've heard is true.

13
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:36,790
He is a cultural icon,

14
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:37,833
a phenomenon,

15
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:41,110
and possibly one of the
smartest people alive today.

16
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:43,780
Formerly a Harvard professor,

17
00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:48,870
Jordan Peterson is currently a clinical
psychologist and professor at University

18
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:51,640
of Toronto and has become a
celebrity in his own right,

19
00:00:51,970 --> 00:00:53,050
which is a very,

20
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:58,080
very good thing for all of us as many
in academia and the left seek to make

21
00:00:58,361 --> 00:01:03,361
victims of anyone who isn't a white CIS
gendered male providing safe spaces on

22
00:01:04,931 --> 00:01:09,490
campus as so young adults never have
to experience the horrors of being

23
00:01:09,491 --> 00:01:10,360
offended.

24
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:15,490
Dr. Peterson has been speaking about the
assault on the greatest liberal value

25
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,380
of all free speech.

26
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:21,790
You may have learned about him a couple
of years ago when he ignited controversy

27
00:01:21,791 --> 00:01:26,791
by refusing to use the long list of made
up gender neutral pronouns that was put

28
00:01:26,981 --> 00:01:28,180
into Canadian law.

29
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:32,560
Bill see 16 while he has no
objections to trans people,

30
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:37,650
he argued forced speech under the guise
of gender identity and gender expression

31
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,220
are too broad.

32
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:44,050
Are the propositions of radical social
constructionists and are being used to

33
00:01:44,051 --> 00:01:46,240
bully opponents into submission.

34
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:47,530
He says,

35
00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:50,200
free speech is not just another value.

36
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:53,410
It's the foundation of
Western civilization.

37
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:54,371
Well,

38
00:01:54,371 --> 00:01:58,690
you may have just learned of Jordan
Peterson from his recent interview with a

39
00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:03,280
British third wave feminist who tried
every way possible to cookie cut Peterson

40
00:02:03,281 --> 00:02:04,300
as a misogynist.

41
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:07,390
The channel for interview in
England with British journalists.

42
00:02:07,391 --> 00:02:12,391
Kathy Newman went viral and
now Dr Peterson's online
videos and there are many

43
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:16,570
are being binged Netflix style.

44
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:17,733
I warn you,

45
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:19,660
you won't be able to watch just one.

46
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:21,820
He just released his new book,

47
00:02:21,821 --> 00:02:23,080
12 rules for life,

48
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:24,610
an antidote to chaos,

49
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:29,560
which has rocketed to the number one or
two depending upon the day on the Amazon

50
00:02:29,561 --> 00:02:30,460
bestseller list.

51
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:32,620
Depends upon where that tabloid trash by.

52
00:02:32,621 --> 00:02:35,530
Michael Wolff is today
along with his new book,

53
00:02:35,531 --> 00:02:37,750
it seems Jordan Peterson is ubiquitous.

54
00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:39,790
His name is on everyone's lips.

55
00:02:40,210 --> 00:02:43,750
I attended an event the other night and
heard his name mentioned several times

56
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:46,120
throughout the evening
by different people.

57
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:51,110
I learned about Jordan Peterson sometime
back watching his interviews first on

58
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:55,970
Joe Rogan's podcast and subsequently on
the countless speeches and lectures he

59
00:02:55,971 --> 00:02:58,430
has given all which can
be found on youtube.

60
00:02:58,610 --> 00:02:59,290
In fact,

61
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:04,290
he has opened up his classes to the
world for free all on line watching his

62
00:03:04,901 --> 00:03:05,381
lectures.

63
00:03:05,381 --> 00:03:09,160
You feel enlightened and
amazed how he combines history,

64
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:10,060
psychology,

65
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:10,870
science,

66
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:15,870
sociology and philosophy into a very
enjoyable and learn it experience.

67
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:20,080
There's so much I can say about Jordan
Peterson and I don't want to sound like a

68
00:03:20,081 --> 00:03:20,914
fan boy,

69
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:24,820
but it is truly an honor
to have him join us today.

70
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:26,980
Obviously I'm not the only fan.

71
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:31,750
As he has had over 100
million hits on Youtube.

72
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:35,710
We opened up questions to ricochet
members and we'll be asking you a few,

73
00:03:35,711 --> 00:03:37,210
but like all good things,

74
00:03:37,211 --> 00:03:38,860
there was never enough time.

75
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:40,330
So if we don't get to yours,

76
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:41,201
apologies,

77
00:03:41,201 --> 00:03:44,110
but we hope to have Dr. Peterson
back on again down the road.

78
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:46,390
So without further ado,

79
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:48,160
pour yourself your favorite drink.

80
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:53,280
Sit back and enjoy the whiskey
politics interview with Dr. Jordan B.

81
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:54,993
Peterson.

82
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:55,871
First of all,

83
00:03:55,871 --> 00:03:56,591
Dr. Peterson,

84
00:03:56,591 --> 00:03:59,170
I want to thank you for joining us
at whiskey politics on ricochet.

85
00:03:59,171 --> 00:04:00,820
It really is an honor to have you with us,

86
00:04:00,821 --> 00:04:02,350
especially how busy you are right now.

87
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:06,520
Now Watch me try and get an hour's
worth of questions into 30 minutes.

88
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:09,220
You just let me know when you need
to get off and we'll wrap it up.

89
00:04:09,221 --> 00:04:10,054
Okay,

90
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:11,150
sounds good.

91
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:11,561
All right.

92
00:04:11,561 --> 00:04:12,310
Thank you.

93
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:14,830
So your name is everywhere right now.

94
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:17,860
There are those of us who've
been following you for some time,

95
00:04:17,861 --> 00:04:20,140
but something happened
in the past few months.

96
00:04:20,170 --> 00:04:23,110
I don't know if it's the Kathy
Newman interview that did it,

97
00:04:23,111 --> 00:04:25,450
but everybody is talking
about Jordan Peterson.

98
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:26,920
You wrote in your book,

99
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:28,930
you are always surprised.

100
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:33,790
People respond positively to what you're
saying regardless or regarding the

101
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,590
seriousness of the subjects.

102
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:39,550
Why do you think people in the tens of
millions are drawn to your message right

103
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:39,731
now?

104
00:04:39,731 --> 00:04:40,810
What are they hungry for?

105
00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:43,720
I think they are hungering for,

106
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:44,803
for,

107
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:48,670
I think they're hungry for evidence
that the idea that their lives are

108
00:04:48,671 --> 00:04:51,460
meaningful and worthwhile
is actually true.

109
00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:53,890
And I do think it's true,

110
00:04:53,891 --> 00:04:57,340
and I detailed that
extensively in my first book,

111
00:04:57,341 --> 00:04:58,091
maps of meaning,

112
00:04:58,091 --> 00:04:59,490
which is a very difficult book,

113
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:02,110
but then again in 12 rules for life.

114
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:07,980
I think that it's reasonable to make the
observation that life is very difficult

115
00:05:08,111 --> 00:05:11,500
and rife with suffering and
tainted with malevolence.

116
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:16,360
But despite that there are in the world,

117
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:22,150
there are ways of being in the world
that are noble and worthwhile and that

118
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,740
ameliorates suffering and,

119
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:28,360
and malevolence and that it's worthwhile
to grow up and take your place in the

120
00:05:28,361 --> 00:05:30,130
world as a responsible citizen.

121
00:05:30,131 --> 00:05:34,150
And that the ideas of sovereign
individuality that have,

122
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:39,460
that underpin the west are great ideas
and correct and that we shouldn't lose

123
00:05:39,461 --> 00:05:40,294
the.

124
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:43,300
And so I think that people are,

125
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:48,930
there's a whole in people's hearts the
same shape as that message and so we may

126
00:05:49,691 --> 00:05:50,141
hear it.

127
00:05:50,141 --> 00:05:54,130
They feel like a part of them that they
didn't know it was missing has been

128
00:05:54,131 --> 00:05:58,550
replaced and so that's
what it looks like to me.

129
00:05:59,570 --> 00:06:01,140
Now you referred a lot of,

130
00:06:01,141 --> 00:06:03,880
many of our listeners have been following
you for some time and a lot of people

131
00:06:03,881 --> 00:06:08,370
that just learning about you and you're
known for detailing how postmodernism is

132
00:06:08,371 --> 00:06:09,990
today's form of Marxism.

133
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:13,350
Is this what you're referring to here
that people have had enough of the

134
00:06:13,351 --> 00:06:16,680
postmodernist maybe cause they've
taken over learning institutions?

135
00:06:16,681 --> 00:06:17,940
Our media and culture?

136
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:19,420
Well that's part of it.

137
00:06:19,421 --> 00:06:19,870
I think it's,

138
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:24,870
there's a deeper Malays do though is
then we'd become unmoored from our

139
00:06:25,241 --> 00:06:29,650
traditional foundations and the
foundations let's say of Judaeo Christian

140
00:06:29,651 --> 00:06:30,484
culture.

141
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:33,040
We don't understand them
who probably never did,

142
00:06:33,041 --> 00:06:35,500
but we acted demoed anyways before,

143
00:06:35,501 --> 00:06:40,501
but we can't lose sight of that tradition
without falling apart in 15 different

144
00:06:41,321 --> 00:06:42,154
ways.

145
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:44,710
I think the postmodern
way of falling apart,

146
00:06:44,711 --> 00:06:45,910
it's just one of many,

147
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,340
but it's very toxic.

148
00:06:48,730 --> 00:06:53,530
It divides us into tribes based
on our ethnicity or our gender,

149
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:55,300
our race,

150
00:06:55,720 --> 00:07:00,690
and then sets us against one
another as oppressive versus victim.

151
00:07:00,691 --> 00:07:01,810
And it's a very,

152
00:07:01,811 --> 00:07:04,330
very pathological and dangerous narrative.

153
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:05,620
So,

154
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:07,990
and I think people know
that instinctively,

155
00:07:07,991 --> 00:07:11,770
they don't want to descend
into tribal identities again,

156
00:07:11,771 --> 00:07:13,900
but that means we needed it.

157
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:18,280
We needed an identity that is
super ordinance to the tribal.

158
00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:20,530
There has to be something above that.

159
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:26,040
And I think the idea of the sovereign
individual is the right transcendent

160
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,290
representation.

161
00:07:28,291 --> 00:07:30,790
And I think that people know that too,

162
00:07:30,791 --> 00:07:31,624
because it's,

163
00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:33,880
that message is everywhere in our culture,

164
00:07:33,881 --> 00:07:36,820
even know it's not made
as explicit as it should.

165
00:07:36,821 --> 00:07:38,650
We're explicit as often as it should.

166
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:39,710
Yeah.

167
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:41,210
You talk about individualism,

168
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:41,530
me,

169
00:07:41,530 --> 00:07:46,130
your message comes from the perspective
of a classic liberal and individualism

170
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,390
is part of that.

171
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:47,950
Uh,

172
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:50,090
but the interesting thing,

173
00:07:50,091 --> 00:07:52,070
you've not only been a student of Marxism,

174
00:07:52,071 --> 00:07:53,450
communism and socialism,

175
00:07:53,451 --> 00:07:55,790
I mean you really went deep into it.

176
00:07:55,791 --> 00:07:59,270
Soviet gulags the rise of Nazi-ism and
the Holocaust and you always refer to the

177
00:07:59,271 --> 00:08:03,170
Gulag archipelago that
the machine eats itself.

178
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:06,170
You relate today's postmodernist
to that same machine.

179
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:07,311
Well,

180
00:08:07,311 --> 00:08:10,400
I think they're driven by the
same pathological ideology.

181
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:15,760
You can tell that by their emphasis on
the impressive versus victim narrative,

182
00:08:15,921 --> 00:08:19,700
which is classic Marxism is
just give him new clothing.

183
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:20,181
You know,

184
00:08:20,181 --> 00:08:23,270
it's not the bourgeoisie
versus the protests.

185
00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:24,081
Proletariat,

186
00:08:24,081 --> 00:08:28,070
it's the oppressed minority
versus the oppressive here.

187
00:08:28,071 --> 00:08:28,904
Majority,

188
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:32,380
same basic idea and company,

189
00:08:32,410 --> 00:08:36,260
not the demand for such
impossibilities as equality of outcome,

190
00:08:36,261 --> 00:08:38,630
which is unbelievably dangerous idea.

191
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:40,560
It's the same ideology.

192
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:45,620
It's just dressed up in more
current clothing and it's,

193
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:46,310
it's,

194
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:48,200
it's going to lead to the same place,

195
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:51,200
so unless we want to go there,

196
00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:55,950
which I wouldn't recommend since we've
already visited and founded unpleasant,

197
00:08:56,490 --> 00:09:01,170
it seems to me that we should pick a
different path and dispense with the

198
00:09:01,171 --> 00:09:06,171
identity politics both on the left and
on the right and go back to what we got

199
00:09:07,321 --> 00:09:08,154
right.

200
00:09:09,010 --> 00:09:11,550
The thing that makes me a little
different than the classic liberal,

201
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:15,930
I guess in some senses
that there's probably more
emphasis from the liberal land

202
00:09:15,931 --> 00:09:17,880
on individual freedom.

203
00:09:18,210 --> 00:09:22,170
Whereas I put a tremendous amount of
emphasis on individual responsibility.

204
00:09:22,171 --> 00:09:26,730
But the union between those two things
would be the emphasis on the individual.

205
00:09:28,130 --> 00:09:28,350
No.

206
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:30,630
So in 12 rules for life,

207
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:34,980
a lot of what I'm trying
to inform people off,

208
00:09:34,981 --> 00:09:35,491
let's say,

209
00:09:35,491 --> 00:09:40,491
is that they can take on very heavy
responsibility for life in all of its

210
00:09:41,431 --> 00:09:46,431
tragedy and let's malevolence and prevail
and that that's what they should do.

211
00:09:46,891 --> 00:09:49,080
And that's the right way
to set the world straight.

212
00:09:49,081 --> 00:09:50,280
It's the honorable way.

213
00:09:50,281 --> 00:09:51,660
It's the noble way.

214
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:53,220
And it works too.

215
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:54,323
It's not,

216
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:56,070
it's not naive optimism.

217
00:09:56,071 --> 00:09:57,630
I'm not a naive optimist.

218
00:09:57,631 --> 00:09:59,460
I know how terrible the world is,

219
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:01,500
but I still think that we can,

220
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:07,160
we can live in it like admirable beings
and we can make it much better than it

221
00:10:07,501 --> 00:10:08,071
is now.

222
00:10:08,071 --> 00:10:12,330
We can start with ourselves and I
think that's the right path forward.

223
00:10:12,650 --> 00:10:13,190
Yeah.

224
00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:13,491
And I,

225
00:10:13,491 --> 00:10:16,490
and I want to get into 12 rules of
life and they edit out to chaos,

226
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:17,030
um,

227
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:17,271
in a,

228
00:10:17,271 --> 00:10:17,871
in a moment.

229
00:10:17,871 --> 00:10:19,010
It's a fantastic book.

230
00:10:19,011 --> 00:10:19,370
And,

231
00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:20,510
and as of right now,

232
00:10:20,511 --> 00:10:20,811
today,

233
00:10:20,811 --> 00:10:23,210
it's number two on the
Amazon bestseller list.

234
00:10:23,211 --> 00:10:24,710
So congratulations on that.

235
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:25,790
But it sounds like you've,

236
00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:26,130
you've,

237
00:10:26,130 --> 00:10:27,200
and what I've read here,

238
00:10:27,201 --> 00:10:29,000
you've surrounded yourself,

239
00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:29,630
uh,

240
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:29,991
with,

241
00:10:29,991 --> 00:10:32,030
with understanding this
to the point where,

242
00:10:32,031 --> 00:10:33,230
and I was a little surprised,

243
00:10:33,290 --> 00:10:33,770
um,

244
00:10:33,770 --> 00:10:34,011
you know,

245
00:10:34,011 --> 00:10:34,641
Norman Doidge,

246
00:10:34,641 --> 00:10:38,390
he wrote the forward in your book 12
rules of life and he says that you have an

247
00:10:38,391 --> 00:10:43,040
expansive art collection of socialist
realist paintings of Lenin and early

248
00:10:43,041 --> 00:10:43,611
communists.

249
00:10:43,611 --> 00:10:48,410
He explains it so that you never forget
the hundreds of millions of people who

250
00:10:48,411 --> 00:10:51,170
were murdered in the name of Utopia.

251
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,120
What about this ideology,

252
00:10:53,121 --> 00:10:54,860
this horror,

253
00:10:54,890 --> 00:10:55,640
if you will,

254
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:58,280
of human suffering that
steered you into studying it?

255
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:00,211
No,

256
00:11:00,211 --> 00:11:02,550
it seemed to me when
I started studying it,

257
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:03,540
the 1980s,

258
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:08,960
we were still in the midst of the CEW
award and hosted a genuine threat not only

259
00:11:09,391 --> 00:11:12,330
to the lives of every
individual on the planet,

260
00:11:12,331 --> 00:11:13,500
but too well,

261
00:11:13,501 --> 00:11:14,760
but to life itself.

262
00:11:14,761 --> 00:11:19,761
And it seemed to me that there was no
problem that required solving more urgent

263
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:26,990
urgently then the problem of pathological
group identification and the conflict

264
00:11:29,041 --> 00:11:30,090
that emerges out of it.

265
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:31,321
And the more,

266
00:11:31,321 --> 00:11:32,390
I mean I,

267
00:11:32,391 --> 00:11:33,224
I took,

268
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:38,990
I took what happened in Nazi Germany
and did in the Soviet Union and malice

269
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,650
China with deep
seriousness considering it,

270
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:45,541
what would you call it,

271
00:11:45,541 --> 00:11:48,990
up a sign of the illness
that be set all of humanity,

272
00:11:48,991 --> 00:11:53,040
not just those countries and
believe that there was no problem.

273
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:54,550
That was more,

274
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:58,660
it was more necessary to take
seriously and to try to solve.

275
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:04,200
And so that's guided me since probably
since the late 1970s I've put all my

276
00:12:05,021 --> 00:12:10,021
effort and teaching pretty much into
understanding group identification at a

277
00:12:11,951 --> 00:12:13,240
psychological level,

278
00:12:14,170 --> 00:12:18,550
trying to account for the ideological
possession and then trying to figure out a

279
00:12:18,551 --> 00:12:23,551
way through it so that people were
neither nihilistic nor puppets of right or

280
00:12:24,251 --> 00:12:27,700
left wing ideology trying to find
out what the alternative to that was.

281
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:32,770
And I think that
responsible individuality,

282
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:34,361
you know,

283
00:12:34,361 --> 00:12:39,361
with respect for society
and the group is the right,

284
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:42,820
I think we got the answer right in the
west and I think that's why the West

285
00:12:42,821 --> 00:12:44,200
isn't complete hell.

286
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:47,770
Like so many countries are so many places.

287
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:52,120
Are you concerned this wave
authoritarianism is sweeping
across North America?

288
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:53,770
I mean we see it in the schools.

289
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:57,040
You became famous obviously
because of the Toronto,

290
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:57,351
uh,

291
00:12:57,351 --> 00:12:59,570
University of Toronto
was situation with a,

292
00:12:59,571 --> 00:13:04,300
with the law for the transgender usage
of words that you were forced to have to

293
00:13:04,301 --> 00:13:05,050
say.

294
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:05,710
Uh,

295
00:13:05,710 --> 00:13:06,011
I mean,

296
00:13:06,011 --> 00:13:07,270
do the college administrators,

297
00:13:07,271 --> 00:13:11,380
many of them who went at academia when
they adverted the Vietnam war themselves,

298
00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:14,410
does just the society just
wait for them to all die off?

299
00:13:14,970 --> 00:13:16,060
What does this end,

300
00:13:16,810 --> 00:13:18,070
well that's a good question.

301
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:18,661
I mean,

302
00:13:18,661 --> 00:13:19,494
I don't know.

303
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:24,310
I don't know what's going to happen with
the universities because the humanities

304
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:29,620
are completely dominated by
postmodern radical left cause it's,

305
00:13:29,621 --> 00:13:32,680
I mean the documentation
for that is clear.

306
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:33,893
Um,

307
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,180
I think what will happen is they'll
just run out of the audience.

308
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:41,590
That's what I'm hoping will happen is
that people will wake up and think,

309
00:13:42,290 --> 00:13:42,821
oh Jesus,

310
00:13:42,821 --> 00:13:43,870
this isn't education.

311
00:13:43,871 --> 00:13:48,460
This is indoctrination and this is a
pessimistic and pathological view of the

312
00:13:48,461 --> 00:13:48,791
world.

313
00:13:48,791 --> 00:13:53,791
All we'll do is produce
increasing division and
hatred between groups and we'd

314
00:13:54,071 --> 00:13:55,300
go better things to do.

315
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:59,110
So I'm hoping that people will turn
away from those disciplines in those

316
00:13:59,111 --> 00:13:59,830
courses.

317
00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:02,500
The problem is they often don't know
that that's what they're going to be

318
00:14:02,501 --> 00:14:03,334
exposed to.

319
00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:06,850
But you know,

320
00:14:06,851 --> 00:14:11,440
who has Lincoln said you can fool
all of the people some of the time,

321
00:14:11,441 --> 00:14:13,870
but you can't fool all of
the people all of the time.

322
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:14,770
Right.

323
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:16,330
So can I hope,

324
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:21,360
I'm hoping that people are waking up and
if they can find something better to do

325
00:14:21,671 --> 00:14:25,660
with their lives than to
become chronically resentful,

326
00:14:25,661 --> 00:14:30,661
professional protesters and
and instigators of group
conflict under the name of

327
00:14:31,391 --> 00:14:33,430
some kind of compassionate morality.

328
00:14:34,210 --> 00:14:35,043
It's complete.

329
00:14:35,650 --> 00:14:39,010
It's completely reprehensible
as far as I can tell.

330
00:14:39,011 --> 00:14:40,240
There's nothing in it's good.

331
00:14:40,930 --> 00:14:45,370
Now it isn't to say that there's nothing
to be said on the left side of the

332
00:14:45,371 --> 00:14:46,360
political spectrum.

333
00:14:46,361 --> 00:14:51,361
Like I know full well that inequality
tends to grow and then as it grows,

334
00:14:54,081 --> 00:14:56,420
it threatens the structure of society.

335
00:14:56,960 --> 00:15:00,950
There has to be a voice for people
who are on the dispossessed end of the

336
00:15:00,951 --> 00:15:01,850
distribution.

337
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:07,520
And so I think there's a perfectly
reasonable place for an informed left wing

338
00:15:07,521 --> 00:15:11,840
who basically speaks for those who have
not managed to be or who didn't have any

339
00:15:11,841 --> 00:15:13,490
opportunity to be successful.

340
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:18,820
But that's not the same as dividing this
up into identity groups based on gender

341
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:22,490
and eternally playing
oppressive versus victim.

342
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:24,200
Right.

343
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:29,200
Our normal relations between human beings
is what you're referring to the left

344
00:15:29,301 --> 00:15:32,930
now trying to mediate that or do
they want the state to mediate that?

345
00:15:32,931 --> 00:15:34,070
What is their end game here?

346
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,073
Well,

347
00:15:36,090 --> 00:15:36,811
I don't know.

348
00:15:36,811 --> 00:15:41,580
The end game hypothetically is a state
where of radical equality of outcome.

349
00:15:42,210 --> 00:15:46,770
Nowhere no one has any more of anything
than anyone else and also no less.

350
00:15:46,771 --> 00:15:49,950
But that's a completely impossible goal.

351
00:15:49,951 --> 00:15:51,060
That will never happen.

352
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:51,791
You know,

353
00:15:51,791 --> 00:15:53,400
as I'm a sole pointed out,

354
00:15:54,090 --> 00:15:58,830
if you give the state enough power
to legislate equality of outcome,

355
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:03,290
you've also given the state enough power
so that it is certain that it would

356
00:16:03,291 --> 00:16:05,820
become a tyrant and I believe that.

357
00:16:05,821 --> 00:16:09,720
But I think that there are
people in the ideological camps,

358
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:11,520
both on the right on the left,

359
00:16:11,521 --> 00:16:13,890
but we're talking about
the left at the moment.

360
00:16:13,891 --> 00:16:17,820
Who would be happy to see everything
burned down as long as those who were

361
00:16:17,821 --> 00:16:21,240
successful were destroyed along with it.

362
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:22,081
So there's,

363
00:16:22,081 --> 00:16:23,290
that certainly happened in,

364
00:16:23,291 --> 00:16:24,090
in,

365
00:16:24,090 --> 00:16:26,490
in the Communist countries
during the 20th century,

366
00:16:26,491 --> 00:16:31,491
there was a tremendous underground sense
of resentment and hatred that motivated

367
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:37,650
the destruction of whole
classes of successful people.

368
00:16:37,651 --> 00:16:38,484
Like the,

369
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:40,200
like the successful farmers,

370
00:16:40,201 --> 00:16:44,820
the Kulaks that were all
killed in the 1920s so

371
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:48,270
who knows what the end game is,

372
00:16:48,271 --> 00:16:49,350
what they say,

373
00:16:49,351 --> 00:16:51,810
what it is fairly straight forwardly yeah,

374
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:52,950
it's the destruction,

375
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:54,270
the patriarchy.

376
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:55,553
Well,

377
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:57,990
that speaks for itself.

378
00:16:59,220 --> 00:16:59,461
You know,

379
00:16:59,461 --> 00:17:01,800
what are the greatest quotes
I've read from you is,

380
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:05,040
is human beings are born
with different capacities.

381
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:06,240
If they are free,

382
00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:10,410
they are not equal and if they
are equal than they are not free.

383
00:17:11,170 --> 00:17:13,450
I think that was
originally Milton Friedman.

384
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:14,020
Oh,

385
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:14,860
was it Milton?

386
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:15,561
He so,

387
00:17:15,561 --> 00:17:15,831
yeah.

388
00:17:15,831 --> 00:17:16,031
Cool.

389
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:16,720
Melty.

390
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:17,553
Okay.

391
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:19,940
I think it's,

392
00:17:20,050 --> 00:17:20,300
it's,

393
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:21,670
it's definitely the case.

394
00:17:21,850 --> 00:17:22,683
Well,

395
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:28,320
the problem with equality
of outcome arguments is well
across what dimension are

396
00:17:29,081 --> 00:17:33,040
you going to ensure that no one has
any more friends than anyone else?

397
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:33,711
Well,

398
00:17:33,711 --> 00:17:38,260
no one is going to have any more lovers
or no one has a bigger art collection or

399
00:17:38,261 --> 00:17:42,820
no one's better at playing
music or has a larger library.

400
00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:47,050
Where are you going to stop
with the demands for equality?

401
00:17:48,370 --> 00:17:53,370
There's no stopping place and people
don't even want the same outcomes.

402
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:55,620
So it's

403
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:58,651
people are,

404
00:17:58,651 --> 00:18:01,440
the thing about freedom is that
people are free to be different.

405
00:18:01,441 --> 00:18:02,220
No,

406
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:02,520
you know,

407
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:07,350
the price we pay for that to some degree
is the inevitability of comparative

408
00:18:07,351 --> 00:18:08,190
failure.

409
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:12,930
But the Marxists liked to
blame inequality on capitalism.

410
00:18:12,931 --> 00:18:16,530
And that's the one of the biggest
technical mistakes they make because

411
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:21,390
inequality is the rule in
natural and social systems alike.

412
00:18:21,390 --> 00:18:26,390
So the populations are distributed
equally in cities and mass is distributed

413
00:18:28,830 --> 00:18:33,830
unequally in stars and trees are of
different heights in the rain forest,

414
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:39,960
all following the same inequality
distribution that characterizes,

415
00:18:39,961 --> 00:18:41,370
say income or wealth.

416
00:18:41,371 --> 00:18:42,200
In a,

417
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,620
in a human society,

418
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:49,250
the inequality problem is much deeper
than it can't be laid at the feet of

419
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:50,131
capitalism.

420
00:18:50,131 --> 00:18:51,420
It's a foolish analysis,

421
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:52,040
but,

422
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:54,660
but inequality is still a problem
and it has to be dealt with.

423
00:18:55,550 --> 00:18:55,890
So,

424
00:18:55,890 --> 00:19:00,890
but the idea that it can be eradicated
in some permanent forum and that the cure

425
00:19:01,651 --> 00:19:06,651
would be better than the
disease is naive at best,

426
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:08,280
willfully blind,

427
00:19:08,910 --> 00:19:09,990
most certainly,

428
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:12,990
and malevolent in most cases.

429
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:15,510
It's mostly based on
resentment and jealousy,

430
00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:21,270
especially in North America because the
typical person in North America is rich

431
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:25,050
beyond the wildest imaginings
of people a hundred years ago.

432
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:26,191
You know?

433
00:19:26,191 --> 00:19:30,990
So even if you're relatively
poor in North America,

434
00:19:30,991 --> 00:19:33,180
you have central heating,

435
00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:34,560
you have running water,

436
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:39,830
you have computational technology that
puts $1 trillion worth of information

437
00:19:39,901 --> 00:19:41,640
every moment at your fingertips.

438
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:42,751
You know,

439
00:19:42,751 --> 00:19:43,584
you're,

440
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:44,820
we're so rich.

441
00:19:45,890 --> 00:19:46,101
Yeah.

442
00:19:46,101 --> 00:19:49,910
And people don't have to worry about
being torn apart by animals or freezing to

443
00:19:49,911 --> 00:19:51,110
death or anything like that.

444
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:52,130
It's a big difference.

445
00:19:53,470 --> 00:19:53,790
Yeah.

446
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:55,540
And it's very unlikely to.

447
00:19:55,541 --> 00:20:00,541
So the other thing I've been trying to
point out is that we should try to muster

448
00:20:00,941 --> 00:20:03,550
up a little bit of gratitude for it.

449
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:09,040
What are the biggest challenges men and
women both have is finding the perfect

450
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:10,270
gift for a man,

451
00:20:10,330 --> 00:20:12,760
whether it's a significant other father,

452
00:20:12,761 --> 00:20:13,331
son,

453
00:20:13,331 --> 00:20:14,164
friend,

454
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:16,120
could be a coworker or your boss,

455
00:20:16,121 --> 00:20:17,350
somebody you play golf with.

456
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:18,130
You know,

457
00:20:18,130 --> 00:20:20,230
it's never easy to find that gift.

458
00:20:20,231 --> 00:20:24,100
And many of us end up just getting a
gift card and it's quick and it's easy,

459
00:20:24,101 --> 00:20:25,480
but it's also quite boring.

460
00:20:25,810 --> 00:20:28,000
And now with Valentine's Day coming up,

461
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:28,631
yeah,

462
00:20:28,631 --> 00:20:29,464
you know,

463
00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:31,840
we all realize it's a
cheesy hallmark holiday,

464
00:20:31,841 --> 00:20:35,620
but it doesn't mean that you have to
get that guy at cheesy hallmark gift.

465
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:41,040
The solution is [inaudible] dot com it's
the only place to find awesome gifts

466
00:20:41,861 --> 00:20:42,970
that guys love.

467
00:20:43,210 --> 00:20:48,210
Now it isn't some Cologne sampler or
cheesy mug man offers a curated gift

468
00:20:48,851 --> 00:20:51,130
collection for every type of guy.

469
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:56,430
There's different collections for the
sports fanatic home chef and outdoorsman.

470
00:20:57,130 --> 00:21:00,550
If you're interested in
cigars or whiskey or beer,

crate and the whiskey appreciation

472
00:21:05,981 --> 00:21:06,640
crate,

00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:11,350
or a fresh takes on
traditional Valentine's day
gifts like the jerky heart or

474
00:21:11,351 --> 00:21:13,870
the Salami Bow k and
it always cracks me up.

475
00:21:13,930 --> 00:21:14,860
It looks good.

476
00:21:15,310 --> 00:21:16,510
It looks really yummy.

477
00:21:17,050 --> 00:21:17,381
You know?

478
00:21:17,381 --> 00:21:21,040
Imagine you're a mad opening
up a whole crate of Salami.

479
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:25,900
Go to man crates.com pick the perfect
gift and then wait for that magic to

480
00:21:25,901 --> 00:21:26,500
happen.

481
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:26,651
See,

482
00:21:26,651 --> 00:21:31,060
what's going to happen is that it's going
to be delivered literally in a crate,

483
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:31,990
hence the name,

484
00:21:32,350 --> 00:21:36,790
and there's no way to open it unless
they use a crowbar which happens to be

485
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:37,653
included.

486
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:43,020
So part of that gift is just getting a
guy to get a box open with a crowbar cue.

487
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:46,930
The Tim Allen voice a voice,

488
00:21:47,410 --> 00:21:52,330
they have thousands of five star reviews
and every gift comes with a complete

489
00:21:52,331 --> 00:21:53,680
satisfaction guarantee.

494
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:15,530
I have a few questions for you
from ricochet members here.

495
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:17,240
Many of our ricochet members,

496
00:22:17,241 --> 00:22:18,100
you pseudonyms.

497
00:22:18,101 --> 00:22:20,300
So you might hear a couple
of funny sounding names here,

498
00:22:20,301 --> 00:22:21,320
but the first one doesn't.

499
00:22:21,330 --> 00:22:22,730
His name is Brian Watt,

500
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,200
and he asks,

501
00:22:24,230 --> 00:22:27,530
what do you think of the current
pope and his apparent leaning?

502
00:22:27,531 --> 00:22:30,530
Some might say anticapitalist
pro socialists,

503
00:22:30,531 --> 00:22:32,810
perhaps postmodernist outlook on life.

504
00:22:32,811 --> 00:22:37,811
Does he find the current
Catholic hierarchy helpful
or a hindrance and standing

505
00:22:38,091 --> 00:22:40,130
up against the wave of postmodernist,

506
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:44,840
neo Marxist indoctrination and
propaganda throughout Western societies?

507
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:46,793
Okay.

508
00:22:47,230 --> 00:22:51,850
I would say I probably don't know
enough to really answer that question

509
00:22:51,851 --> 00:22:52,870
intelligently.

510
00:22:53,770 --> 00:22:55,720
It's necessary generally speaking,

511
00:22:55,721 --> 00:23:00,721
for the Catholic Church to err on the
side of compassion for the poor and

512
00:23:02,411 --> 00:23:03,760
dispossessed so we could say,

513
00:23:03,761 --> 00:23:04,450
well,

514
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:07,000
perhaps that's what the
current pope is doing,

515
00:23:07,270 --> 00:23:12,270
but I don't know enough about his
doctrines and aims to provide a criticism

516
00:23:13,531 --> 00:23:15,390
that's any more intelligent than that.

517
00:23:16,670 --> 00:23:17,503
Okay.

518
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:21,530
A second one is from judge mental told
you he had some great pseudonyms here.

519
00:23:22,850 --> 00:23:24,200
Judgemental asks you,

520
00:23:24,230 --> 00:23:26,270
what do you think will
be the next battlefield?

521
00:23:26,271 --> 00:23:30,680
We've gotten to the point where even
gender is now set to be up for grabs.

522
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:32,000
What does it go from here?

523
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:33,693
Hmm.

524
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:39,600
There'll be babbling over whether or not
scientific truth is acceptable as truth

525
00:23:40,990 --> 00:23:43,000
or just another form of power,

526
00:23:43,570 --> 00:23:44,980
power play power.

527
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:46,640
That's already happening.

528
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:48,343
Um,

529
00:23:48,350 --> 00:23:53,350
there'll be in the soul to him the idea
of qualitative diff distinctions per se.

530
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:55,760
The idea that one thing
is better than another,

531
00:23:56,090 --> 00:23:59,390
that'll come under attack and all sorts
of different dimensions that's already

532
00:23:59,391 --> 00:24:00,224
happening.

533
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:01,733
Um,

534
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:03,770
because the problem is,

535
00:24:03,771 --> 00:24:06,320
is that if you allow for
qualitative distinctions,

536
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:10,310
so if you allow for the suggestion
that one thing is better than another,

537
00:24:10,790 --> 00:24:14,000
then you rationalize the
existence of inequality.

538
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:19,670
Because if one thing is
better than another and people
provide the better thing,

539
00:24:20,030 --> 00:24:22,760
then you can make a case
that they should succeed,

540
00:24:22,761 --> 00:24:23,780
where others should fail,

541
00:24:23,781 --> 00:24:25,130
and that produces inequality.

542
00:24:25,131 --> 00:24:30,131
So the radical argument against inequality
has to end in the destruction of the

543
00:24:31,161 --> 00:24:33,350
idea of value distinctions themselves.

544
00:24:33,650 --> 00:24:34,660
And I think that's part of,

545
00:24:34,770 --> 00:24:36,620
that's built into postmodernism anyways.

546
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:38,540
That's the sacrifice
they're willing to make.

547
00:24:38,930 --> 00:24:43,010
So we're going to see more of
an outright attack on biology,

548
00:24:43,011 --> 00:24:46,670
especially evolutionary biology and
psychology that's already happening.

549
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:48,050
Um,

550
00:24:48,050 --> 00:24:53,050
and assault on the idea that scientific
truth has some sort of privileged status

551
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:54,380
that's already happening.

552
00:24:55,190 --> 00:25:00,190
So we'll see an assault on the idea that
there's any such thing as an objective

553
00:25:02,211 --> 00:25:04,970
of education that's already
happening in Canada,

554
00:25:06,530 --> 00:25:08,330
in Ontario with the elementary teachers,

555
00:25:08,331 --> 00:25:12,020
federation has already decided that the
purpose of education from kindergarten

556
00:25:12,021 --> 00:25:15,890
to grade eight is to produce students
with a social justice activist

557
00:25:15,891 --> 00:25:16,724
orientation.

558
00:25:17,450 --> 00:25:21,260
And they've even selected
all the literature that the
kids will be exposed to in

559
00:25:21,261 --> 00:25:24,020
order to foster that
India logical perspective.

560
00:25:24,710 --> 00:25:24,820
I mean,

561
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:27,020
that's right out in the open
and that's on their website.

562
00:25:27,021 --> 00:25:28,130
It's part of the curriculum.

563
00:25:28,850 --> 00:25:29,620
So,

564
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:33,580
so is this a devaluing of empirical
evidence then that we just don't believe

565
00:25:33,581 --> 00:25:34,414
anything anymore?

566
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:37,940
We believe what the postmodern
ideas that you believe,

567
00:25:37,941 --> 00:25:40,340
whatever fosters the
interest of your group.

568
00:25:41,630 --> 00:25:43,240
There's no truth above that.

569
00:25:44,650 --> 00:25:44,990
Yeah,

570
00:25:44,990 --> 00:25:45,320
it's a,

571
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:47,600
it's an absolutely dismal hypothesis.

572
00:25:47,690 --> 00:25:48,523
Wow.

573
00:25:48,570 --> 00:25:48,811
Now,

574
00:25:48,811 --> 00:25:50,700
as people were asking questions of you,

575
00:25:50,730 --> 00:25:51,010
uh,

576
00:25:51,010 --> 00:25:51,451
in a,

577
00:25:51,451 --> 00:25:54,510
in our forum and interesting
discussion between ricochet members,

578
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:56,490
NFE and front seat cat occurred,

579
00:25:56,790 --> 00:25:57,510
again,

580
00:25:57,510 --> 00:25:59,450
pseudonyms occurred in,

581
00:25:59,451 --> 00:26:03,600
in relation to your interview with Kathy
Newman and pertaining specifically to

582
00:26:03,601 --> 00:26:04,770
agreeableness.

583
00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:10,070
Now remember Anna fee told her sister
who was angry over not being paid as much

584
00:26:10,501 --> 00:26:15,240
as a male coworker to go and make the
case to her boss and demand more money.

585
00:26:15,241 --> 00:26:17,160
Now I know anesthesia is
a strong willed woman.

586
00:26:17,970 --> 00:26:22,970
Now her sister felt her work should
speak for itself and front seat cat,

587
00:26:23,491 --> 00:26:28,140
another member agreed with NFE sister
that she shouldn't have had to ask that

588
00:26:28,141 --> 00:26:32,790
the raise was then about behavior
and not about the quality of work.

589
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:34,950
You referred to agreeableness,

590
00:26:34,951 --> 00:26:35,310
right,

591
00:26:35,310 --> 00:26:38,670
and not gender as the reason people
may not achieve their potential.

592
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:40,440
It's one of the reasons,

593
00:26:40,441 --> 00:26:42,510
there's many reasons for pay differential,

594
00:26:42,630 --> 00:26:46,140
but not only do you have to do good work,

595
00:26:46,410 --> 00:26:50,340
you have to be seen to do good work
and you have to make a case for it.

596
00:26:50,730 --> 00:26:52,950
It's like in the best
of all possible worlds.

597
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:56,970
He would sit back and your accomplishments
would speak for themselves.

598
00:26:57,420 --> 00:27:01,650
But that assumes that the people that
you're talking to have enough time to even

599
00:27:01,651 --> 00:27:04,110
pay attention to what
you're doing and notice.

600
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:05,940
And that's often not the case,

601
00:27:05,941 --> 00:27:09,390
especially if if you're a quiet
worker and you're competent,

602
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:12,240
the price you pay for
that is in visibility.

603
00:27:12,890 --> 00:27:14,370
And people,

604
00:27:14,371 --> 00:27:14,881
you'd think,

605
00:27:14,881 --> 00:27:15,031
well,

606
00:27:15,031 --> 00:27:16,210
people should notice what we're,

607
00:27:16,211 --> 00:27:19,650
what we're doing and rewarded
and they probably should.

608
00:27:20,130 --> 00:27:25,130
But that doesn't mean that you lack
all responsibility in making your case

609
00:27:25,141 --> 00:27:25,974
known.

610
00:27:26,670 --> 00:27:29,160
And most of the time a boss,

611
00:27:29,250 --> 00:27:33,420
a manager who's busy doing
150 different things,

612
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:34,950
isn't going to

613
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:42,080
be alert constantly enough to make sure
that your career is being fostered in

614
00:27:42,391 --> 00:27:43,860
the optimal possible manner.

615
00:27:44,070 --> 00:27:45,450
You might have to make a case.

616
00:27:45,990 --> 00:27:49,710
Often people don't even know what
you're doing if you're competent.

617
00:27:50,550 --> 00:27:53,970
And so I think it's a very
naive view of the world to say,

618
00:27:53,971 --> 00:27:54,301
well,

619
00:27:54,301 --> 00:27:55,860
my work should speak for itself.

620
00:27:55,861 --> 00:27:56,694
It's like,

621
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:57,330
well,

622
00:27:57,330 --> 00:28:00,990
the wouldn't be advertising if
people's work could speak for itself.

623
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,550
And there wouldn't be marketing,

624
00:28:02,610 --> 00:28:03,900
there wouldn't be sales,

625
00:28:04,470 --> 00:28:05,040
you know?

626
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:06,690
And for most products,

627
00:28:06,691 --> 00:28:07,171
sales,

628
00:28:07,171 --> 00:28:11,190
marketing and advertising
is like 75% of the product,

629
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:12,180
right?

630
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:16,470
So it's just naive and it's not
like money is just laying around.

631
00:28:16,471 --> 00:28:17,450
Everyone's after it.

632
00:28:17,451 --> 00:28:18,840
It's in scarce supply.

633
00:28:19,530 --> 00:28:22,230
And so if you want to develop your career,

634
00:28:22,810 --> 00:28:25,410
if you have some notion about
how much money you need to make,

635
00:28:25,411 --> 00:28:26,840
then you have to go out there and,

636
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:31,560
and strategically employ
a plan to obtain that

637
00:28:33,150 --> 00:28:35,850
and learning how to promote
yourself or stand up for yourself.

638
00:28:35,851 --> 00:28:37,140
And you've referred to this in your book,

639
00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:39,030
you're talking about standing up straight,

640
00:28:39,150 --> 00:28:39,570
right?

641
00:28:39,570 --> 00:28:42,540
I mean it's about having
confidence and belief in yourself.

642
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:43,561
Yeah.

643
00:28:43,561 --> 00:28:45,000
Well if you lunch also,

644
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:49,860
I also tell people in the book suggest
to people that they consult the

645
00:28:49,861 --> 00:28:50,601
resentments.

646
00:28:50,601 --> 00:28:51,630
So let's say you're

647
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:55,530
working way madly at your job,

648
00:28:56,790 --> 00:28:58,050
then you're very mouthy,

649
00:28:58,051 --> 00:28:59,460
but less competent.

650
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:04,820
Coworker is getting paid more and it
just starts to eat away at your heart and

651
00:29:05,581 --> 00:29:08,130
to poison your relationship
with your work.

652
00:29:08,490 --> 00:29:09,240
Well,

653
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:10,710
what should you do about that?

654
00:29:11,540 --> 00:29:12,373
No,

655
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:18,000
you should first of all notice that
you're becoming resentful and then you

656
00:29:18,001 --> 00:29:18,990
should ask yourself,

657
00:29:18,991 --> 00:29:19,824
well,

658
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:23,700
am I just being whiny and
neurotic and complaining?

659
00:29:23,701 --> 00:29:25,710
Or is there an actually an injustice here?

660
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:29,280
And if the answer is there's
actually an injustice,

661
00:29:29,310 --> 00:29:32,460
then you have to make your case and you,

662
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:36,780
you do that so that you stop yourself
from being resentful so that you can stay

663
00:29:36,990 --> 00:29:38,670
happy to be going to work.

664
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:42,790
And so that you can set
the institution straight.

665
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:43,661
You know,

666
00:29:43,661 --> 00:29:46,000
justice doesn't appear of its own accord.

667
00:29:46,001 --> 00:29:48,730
It's something you have to
work for on your own behalf.

668
00:29:49,510 --> 00:29:50,890
Comes on the behalf of others.

669
00:29:52,150 --> 00:29:52,983
You know,

670
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:54,010
it's like the,

671
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:57,850
let's say you're a husband and you're
a little bit too agreeable and you say

672
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:58,870
your wife doesn't,

673
00:29:59,010 --> 00:29:59,843
um,

674
00:29:59,950 --> 00:30:03,370
there's things that you need or
want that your wife isn't providing.

675
00:30:03,790 --> 00:30:04,660
You won't talk to her.

676
00:30:04,661 --> 00:30:05,021
You say,

677
00:30:05,021 --> 00:30:05,171
well,

678
00:30:05,171 --> 00:30:06,280
if she really loved me,

679
00:30:06,281 --> 00:30:07,600
she just know.

680
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:08,560
It's like,

681
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:09,393
no,

682
00:30:09,490 --> 00:30:12,550
she's not omniscient and
you're not transparent.

683
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:14,320
So you have to go and say,

684
00:30:14,321 --> 00:30:14,621
look,

685
00:30:14,621 --> 00:30:15,610
here's what I want.

686
00:30:16,030 --> 00:30:18,790
You have to negotiate about it because
maybe you don't get what you want.

687
00:30:18,791 --> 00:30:19,750
But maybe you do,

688
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:21,370
here's what I want.

689
00:30:21,371 --> 00:30:22,660
Here's what would satisfy me.

690
00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:24,340
This is why it's important.

691
00:30:24,341 --> 00:30:25,720
This is what we need to do.

692
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:31,380
And that's how you start the relationship
from becoming an anachronistic and

693
00:30:31,751 --> 00:30:32,231
corrupt.

694
00:30:32,231 --> 00:30:33,520
And it's the same at work.

695
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:35,860
You always have to fight for justice,

696
00:30:35,990 --> 00:30:36,820
always,

697
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:37,653
always.

698
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:38,471
And why not?

699
00:30:38,471 --> 00:30:38,921
Of course,

700
00:30:38,921 --> 00:30:39,754
you have to

701
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:42,680
some of your critics after that interview,

702
00:30:42,681 --> 00:30:43,730
which went viral,

703
00:30:43,731 --> 00:30:44,570
it's insane.

704
00:30:44,630 --> 00:30:45,290
Uh,

705
00:30:45,290 --> 00:30:48,380
they refer to you some of the critics
and it's very few of them by the way,

706
00:30:48,381 --> 00:30:51,790
that mostly in the media and academia
they refer to as a massage earnest.

707
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:55,970
Yet you say the greatest
threat to women is a weak man.

708
00:30:56,180 --> 00:30:57,080
It seems.

709
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:58,130
Dr. Peterson,

710
00:30:58,130 --> 00:31:00,020
we are surrounded by them today.

711
00:31:00,050 --> 00:31:01,370
Are men becoming weaker?

712
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:02,630
Well,

713
00:31:02,630 --> 00:31:06,290
men are constantly told that
if they were just harmless,

714
00:31:06,291 --> 00:31:11,291
the world would be a much better place
if they were weakened few tile and you

715
00:31:11,890 --> 00:31:12,510
know,

716
00:31:12,510 --> 00:31:13,490
constrained older,

717
00:31:13,491 --> 00:31:17,420
assertive and aggressive impulses
and quit going out there and being so

718
00:31:17,421 --> 00:31:19,520
patriarchal and all of that.

719
00:31:19,730 --> 00:31:24,730
And it's mostly nonsense mean when you
want for men is an extraordinary and

720
00:31:25,131 --> 00:31:28,190
women as well as an extraordinarily
high level of competence.

721
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:31,880
And most of our functional
hierarchies are built on competence,

722
00:31:31,910 --> 00:31:32,743
not power.

723
00:31:33,490 --> 00:31:37,880
And why in the world would any woman want
not want to have a man around who was

724
00:31:37,881 --> 00:31:38,930
competent and less.

725
00:31:38,931 --> 00:31:41,630
All she wanted was dumb to be dominant,

726
00:31:42,230 --> 00:31:42,740
you know?

727
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:44,620
And some of them would like
that because they're there,

728
00:31:44,670 --> 00:31:48,500
they'd had their relationships with men
damaged and they want to make sure that

729
00:31:48,501 --> 00:31:51,590
anybody that's around them is under
their thumb because they're afraid of,

730
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:53,720
while they're afraid of the alternative.

731
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:55,610
But it's not a good way to live.

732
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:57,870
And so this is how this whole,

733
00:31:57,890 --> 00:31:59,660
this misogyny ideas just,

734
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:01,340
it's so absurd that it's,

735
00:32:01,370 --> 00:32:01,701
it's,

736
00:32:01,701 --> 00:32:02,534
it's,

737
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:04,670
it's evidence of something else.

738
00:32:05,210 --> 00:32:06,620
I'm a reasonable person.

739
00:32:07,070 --> 00:32:10,580
I don't approve of what the
radical leftists are up to.

740
00:32:10,910 --> 00:32:14,870
I know why what they're doing is
pathological and where it's going to lead.

741
00:32:15,710 --> 00:32:18,770
I make the case strongly and reasonably.

742
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:21,410
And because they have no
defense of their ideas,

743
00:32:21,411 --> 00:32:24,110
what they do is target me
with all sorts of epithets.

744
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:24,771
Mean,

745
00:32:24,771 --> 00:32:28,730
I've had dozens of women in my
clinical practice who I've been hell,

746
00:32:28,731 --> 00:32:31,040
I've helped them develop
their careers like mad,

747
00:32:31,041 --> 00:32:31,760
you know?

748
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:33,590
And a lot of these were
high achieving women,

749
00:32:33,591 --> 00:32:34,341
but not all of them.

750
00:32:34,341 --> 00:32:36,350
Some of them were struggling
along at the bottom.

751
00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:41,210
We spend hours and hours all the time
out how to strategize so they could move

752
00:32:41,211 --> 00:32:46,190
themselves forward in their relationships
and when they're in their careers,

753
00:32:46,191 --> 00:32:47,240
in your education.

754
00:32:47,690 --> 00:32:49,880
So the idea that I'm a misogynist,

755
00:32:49,881 --> 00:32:50,714
it's like,

756
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:50,931
well,

757
00:32:50,931 --> 00:32:51,710
whatever you,

758
00:32:51,710 --> 00:32:54,800
you have your opinion about
it and you have your reasons.

759
00:32:54,801 --> 00:32:55,970
But um,

760
00:32:57,740 --> 00:33:02,120
the fact that I'm helping men develop
their competence hardly makes me an enemy

761
00:33:02,121 --> 00:33:06,950
of women unless the woman who think that
are so clueless that they think that

762
00:33:06,951 --> 00:33:07,710
they would benefit

763
00:33:07,710 --> 00:33:09,930
by having more weak men in the world.

764
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:11,280
And some people think that,

765
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:12,600
but it's foolish.

766
00:33:12,990 --> 00:33:14,380
Last question on that for,

767
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:16,290
I watched the followup
interview in Amsterdam.

768
00:33:16,291 --> 00:33:17,124
I think it wasn't,

769
00:33:17,250 --> 00:33:19,740
you obviously had decompressed
a bit from the interview,

770
00:33:19,741 --> 00:33:24,210
which was shortly before that and you
said you felt somewhat bad that you did

771
00:33:24,211 --> 00:33:27,180
the Gotcha moment further away from this.

772
00:33:27,181 --> 00:33:27,391
You know,

773
00:33:27,391 --> 00:33:29,040
a couple of weeks now in retrospect,

774
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:32,040
would you have said anything
differently in that interview with her?

775
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:33,880
Yeah.

776
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:34,610
Well,

777
00:33:34,610 --> 00:33:39,000
I'm not unhappy with the interview
and the idea with the Garcia was,

778
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:40,090
I was making a joke,

779
00:33:40,091 --> 00:33:40,331
you know,

780
00:33:40,331 --> 00:33:41,170
and yeah,

781
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:42,790
it was a wild time joking.

782
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:43,270
There's,

783
00:33:43,270 --> 00:33:45,030
there's utility in the Joel Comm.

784
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:49,840
One of my friends pointed out that I
could have used that as an opening to

785
00:33:49,841 --> 00:33:51,850
starting a more detailed conversation,

786
00:33:51,851 --> 00:33:53,170
a more serious conversation,

787
00:33:53,171 --> 00:33:55,110
but we were pressed for time.

788
00:33:55,140 --> 00:33:56,770
The interview was almost over.

789
00:33:57,380 --> 00:34:02,350
It's useful to keep things to introduce
some liberty where that's possible.

790
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:03,393
Um,

791
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:06,100
I think the interview went as
well as I could have hoped.

792
00:34:06,101 --> 00:34:06,610
Porn.

793
00:34:06,610 --> 00:34:07,510
That's good enough.

794
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:08,040
Like,

795
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:08,920
you know,

796
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:10,990
going over it with a fine tooth comb.

797
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:13,720
I can think of things that I might've,

798
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:15,940
what broaches I might've taken.

799
00:34:15,941 --> 00:34:16,721
It wouldn't be different,

800
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:18,980
but it isn't clear to me that
that would have necessarily been

801
00:34:19,090 --> 00:34:19,923
better.

802
00:34:20,590 --> 00:34:22,780
Does it surprise you they
turned her into her a victim?

803
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:25,673
Yeah.

804
00:34:25,710 --> 00:34:26,543
Well,

805
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:26,900
yeah,

806
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:28,590
it was actually quite shocking to me.

807
00:34:28,591 --> 00:34:28,901
Yeah.

808
00:34:28,901 --> 00:34:31,500
It can begin with because it was so,

809
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:35,310
it was so both predictable
and preposterous.

810
00:34:35,311 --> 00:34:35,701
It's like,

811
00:34:35,701 --> 00:34:35,881
well,

812
00:34:35,881 --> 00:34:36,900
she's a public figure.

813
00:34:36,901 --> 00:34:38,010
She's hardly a victim.

814
00:34:38,011 --> 00:34:38,770
She's,

815
00:34:38,770 --> 00:34:40,950
it's not like she's
without power or influence.

816
00:34:40,951 --> 00:34:42,030
She's got plenty of it.

817
00:34:43,140 --> 00:34:45,060
She's doing quite well financially too.

818
00:34:45,061 --> 00:34:46,740
I imagine them on most,

819
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:49,080
on most dimensions of measurement.

820
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:50,280
Um,

821
00:34:50,370 --> 00:34:51,390
but to try it out,

822
00:34:51,391 --> 00:34:53,640
that victim narrative so rapidly was,

823
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:53,821
well,

824
00:34:53,821 --> 00:34:54,301
first of all,

825
00:34:54,301 --> 00:34:55,950
reprehensible and second of all,

826
00:34:56,230 --> 00:34:57,810
appallingly predictable.

827
00:34:58,380 --> 00:35:00,960
And it was quite shocking
because when it first happened,

828
00:35:00,961 --> 00:35:02,850
about 20 newspapers carried,

829
00:35:02,851 --> 00:35:04,440
picked up the ball and ran with it,

830
00:35:04,441 --> 00:35:05,274
you know,

831
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:08,190
mostly in Canada and in the UK,

832
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:12,510
but then a counter narrative
develop pretty rapidly.

833
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:13,921
And,

834
00:35:13,921 --> 00:35:14,754
uh,

835
00:35:15,830 --> 00:35:16,201
you know,

836
00:35:16,201 --> 00:35:19,470
it isn't clear that the victim narrative
is the one that carried the day.

837
00:35:20,010 --> 00:35:20,843
So

838
00:35:22,290 --> 00:35:23,011
I don't think it,

839
00:35:23,011 --> 00:35:24,210
I don't think it carried the day,

840
00:35:24,211 --> 00:35:26,280
but it was certainly voiced out there.

841
00:35:26,281 --> 00:35:27,114
And you know what,

842
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:29,700
what do they say when you
have ink by the barrel?

843
00:35:29,701 --> 00:35:31,050
They're going to be the loudest ones.

844
00:35:31,830 --> 00:35:32,610
Yeah,

845
00:35:32,610 --> 00:35:33,320
yeah.

846
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:34,153
Uh,

847
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:34,620
so,

848
00:35:34,620 --> 00:35:34,830
uh,

849
00:35:34,830 --> 00:35:35,430
last question.

850
00:35:35,430 --> 00:35:35,521
Uh,

851
00:35:35,521 --> 00:35:35,851
you're,

852
00:35:35,851 --> 00:35:36,990
you're obviously a Canadian,

853
00:35:37,290 --> 00:35:38,070
but you have your

854
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:39,780
pulse on American politics.

855
00:35:39,810 --> 00:35:42,750
And Ricochet is a right of
center site and community.

856
00:35:43,050 --> 00:35:44,430
In one of your speeches,

857
00:35:44,431 --> 00:35:49,431
you thought the vote for Trump was people
basically just saying they had enough.

858
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:51,600
Were you surprised by the election?

859
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:54,293
Yeah,

860
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:58,440
a month before that I was certain
that Clinton was going to win.

861
00:35:58,770 --> 00:36:01,800
I was shocked by the election.

862
00:36:01,801 --> 00:36:04,980
But the thing is the
Americans that mean split 50,

863
00:36:04,981 --> 00:36:06,810
50 for about 15 years.

864
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:07,860
So,

865
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:09,500
and it was really no different than that.

866
00:36:09,530 --> 00:36:13,170
The split between the
population is so close that,

867
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:13,771
you know,

868
00:36:13,771 --> 00:36:16,680
minor perturbations can
throw it one way or another.

869
00:36:16,681 --> 00:36:21,681
And I do think that identity politics
was one of the factors that elected Trump

870
00:36:22,351 --> 00:36:23,790
people had just had enough of it.

871
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:29,130
So I guess I was surprised because I
didn't regard Trump as a particularly

872
00:36:29,131 --> 00:36:29,964
credible,

873
00:36:30,810 --> 00:36:31,410
um,

874
00:36:31,410 --> 00:36:32,490
potential leader.

875
00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:33,600
And I,

876
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:33,871
you know,

877
00:36:33,871 --> 00:36:35,970
it's not like I was
alone in that estimation,

878
00:36:35,971 --> 00:36:36,804
but,

879
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:37,201
but,

880
00:36:37,201 --> 00:36:38,034
um,

881
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:39,270
I guess people,

882
00:36:39,271 --> 00:36:43,510
I think people decided they preferred
the impulsive lies of Trump to the

883
00:36:43,630 --> 00:36:45,210
calculated lies of Clinton.

884
00:36:47,430 --> 00:36:49,080
You need more honest lies.

885
00:36:49,650 --> 00:36:50,483
Wait,

886
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:54,090
what are your thoughts thus far?

887
00:36:55,090 --> 00:36:55,923
Um,

888
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:58,350
I'm refraining from judging.

889
00:36:59,400 --> 00:36:59,700
Look,

890
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:00,540
North Korea.

891
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:04,560
So look good for the good and
the world hasn't fallen apart.

892
00:37:04,561 --> 00:37:06,750
So I'm always amazed
when not hasn't happened.

893
00:37:06,751 --> 00:37:08,880
So hopefully that will continue.

894
00:37:09,190 --> 00:37:09,850
Yeah,

895
00:37:09,850 --> 00:37:10,683
yeah,

896
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:11,101
that's good.

897
00:37:11,101 --> 00:37:11,481
Go.

898
00:37:11,481 --> 00:37:12,314
I'm,

899
00:37:12,510 --> 00:37:16,050
I've got another meeting coming up right
away and my people around here getting

900
00:37:16,051 --> 00:37:18,210
all agitated because I'm talking,

901
00:37:18,690 --> 00:37:19,750
we're not shape moving.

902
00:37:19,751 --> 00:37:21,360
Some doctor talked to Jordan Peterson.

903
00:37:21,361 --> 00:37:21,961
It's been a treat.

904
00:37:21,961 --> 00:37:22,800
Talking with you today.

905
00:37:22,801 --> 00:37:25,650
Would love to continue to discuss
this discussion with you soon.

906
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:27,240
Thank you so much for your time.

907
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:27,601
Yeah,

908
00:37:27,601 --> 00:37:31,140
well thanks very much for the invitation
and it was good talking with you.

909
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:31,860
Thank you.

910
00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:32,670
Take care.

911
00:37:32,670 --> 00:37:32,920
All right.

912
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:33,030
Bye.

913
00:37:33,030 --> 00:37:33,240
Bye.
