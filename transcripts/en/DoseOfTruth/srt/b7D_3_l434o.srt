1
00:00:06,550 --> 00:00:07,880
Travis luke says,

2
00:00:07,881 --> 00:00:11,510
why are dragons in western culture bring
yourself death and destruction that

3
00:00:11,511 --> 00:00:13,310
must be slain while in the east?

4
00:00:13,311 --> 00:00:15,740
They're portant of good
fortune to be revered?

5
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:16,940
Well,

6
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:17,780
that's a great question,

7
00:00:17,781 --> 00:00:18,614
by the way.

8
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:19,640
Um,

9
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:19,980
the,

10
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:20,813
the Dragon,

11
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:24,493
the Dragon,

12
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:26,510
I already defined the
dragon at some point,

13
00:00:26,511 --> 00:00:30,560
partly from a book I read a while
back on dragons as a tree cat,

14
00:00:30,561 --> 00:00:31,400
snake bird.

15
00:00:31,401 --> 00:00:35,690
The idea in the book was that the Dragon
was a imagistic representation of the

16
00:00:35,691 --> 00:00:37,280
class of all predators,

17
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:40,160
which means also might be why dragons.

18
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:41,043
Um,

19
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:46,150
also breathe fire because
fire was undoubtedly a common
destructive agent in our

20
00:00:46,221 --> 00:00:47,480
evolutionary past.

21
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:53,010
But the dragon is the most primordial
cysts symbol of that which looks beyond,

22
00:00:53,931 --> 00:00:54,920
which is known.

23
00:00:56,030 --> 00:00:56,511
In fact,

24
00:00:56,511 --> 00:01:00,680
it's even more primordial than that
because it even is that which lurks beyond

25
00:01:00,681 --> 00:01:02,270
what is unknown in some sense.

26
00:01:02,271 --> 00:01:03,560
Remember Don Rumsfeld,

27
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:04,400
unknown,

28
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,510
unknown unknowns.

29
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:05,901
Well,

30
00:01:05,901 --> 00:01:07,110
that's basically the drag.

31
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:11,090
There's some unknowns that pop up that
you can master right away and you can

32
00:01:11,091 --> 00:01:13,010
kind of think of those as known unknown's.

33
00:01:13,011 --> 00:01:16,420
But unknown unknowns are those things
that pop up that you don't know about.

34
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:17,720
You didn't even,

35
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:21,830
you had no idea whatsoever
that they even existed anyways.

36
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:24,110
What's the character of an unknown?

37
00:01:24,111 --> 00:01:24,944
Unknown?

38
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:25,141
Well,

39
00:01:25,141 --> 00:01:27,080
part of it's terrifying because it can,

40
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:27,950
it can,

41
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:29,060
it can do you in,

42
00:01:29,061 --> 00:01:29,840
right,

43
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:34,720
but part of it's also
positive and and because it,

44
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:37,160
anything that's truly
unknown brings it with it.

45
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:39,410
A tremendous amount of new possibility.

46
00:01:39,411 --> 00:01:43,910
That's why dragons hoard gold or why
they also heard princesses or guard

47
00:01:43,911 --> 00:01:45,020
princesses hoard,

48
00:01:45,021 --> 00:01:46,250
I would say is the right word.

49
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:51,230
So I don't think the dragon in the West
is a fully negative symbol because the

50
00:01:51,231 --> 00:01:53,800
dragon has gold associated
with it or virgin.

51
00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:57,760
The reason for that is that the hero
who confronts the Dragon gets the Virgin

52
00:01:57,761 --> 00:01:59,150
and that hasn't changed.

53
00:01:59,150 --> 00:01:59,840
That's,

54
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:03,650
that's a story as old as time and I
don't think it'll ever change as long as

55
00:02:03,651 --> 00:02:08,651
there are human beings now why the Chinese
put stress on the positive side and

56
00:02:10,911 --> 00:02:14,930
the West put stress on the
negative side is difficult to say.

57
00:02:14,931 --> 00:02:19,820
I might say because the
Chinese got organized so early,

58
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:24,350
I have a sneaking suspicion that
it was easier for them to see.

59
00:02:24,351 --> 00:02:26,660
A little bit of chaos
is something positive,

60
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:31,130
something necessary and positive as
a counterbalance to the tremendous

61
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:33,530
organizational weight of their state.

62
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:34,873
Um,

63
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:35,983
that's the best,

64
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:38,480
best answer that I've
been able to formulate.

65
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:39,823
Um,

66
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:41,503
so,

67
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:43,161
so anyways,

68
00:02:43,161 --> 00:02:45,410
the dragon is a very complex
and ambivalence symbol.

69
00:02:45,411 --> 00:02:45,650
It,

70
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:47,810
it combines everything into one symbol,

71
00:02:47,811 --> 00:02:48,950
positive and negative,

72
00:02:48,951 --> 00:02:51,470
and then you can stress the positive
or you can stress the negative.

73
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:55,610
You could also say to some degree that
whether a dragon is positive or negative

74
00:02:55,850 --> 00:03:00,430
depends to some degree on the
manner in which you approach it.

75
00:03:00,431 --> 00:03:05,431
Because the psychological reality is
that dragons approached voluntarily,

76
00:03:06,341 --> 00:03:06,641
well,

77
00:03:06,641 --> 00:03:08,800
small are most likely to be positive.

78
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,290
And that's a really good
thing to know in your life.

79
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:11,620
Uh,

80
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:12,490
it's a good reason.

81
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:17,200
It's a good rule of thumb to help you
stop avoiding things that you shouldn't

82
00:03:17,201 --> 00:03:21,610
avoid so that they don't
grow and magnified beyond
your capacity to deal with

83
00:03:21,611 --> 00:03:21,790
them.
