1
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:08,510
And this is something else I
wanted to talk to you about.

2
00:00:08,511 --> 00:00:09,630
You know when you're,

3
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:10,790
you're an admirer of Eric.

4
00:00:10,791 --> 00:00:10,901
No,

5
00:00:10,901 --> 00:00:12,080
I'm an n of Carl Young.

6
00:00:12,081 --> 00:00:12,321
Yeah.

7
00:00:12,321 --> 00:00:13,160
And that's the norm.

8
00:00:13,161 --> 00:00:16,160
And connection is really interesting
cause I think he's a bloody genius.

9
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:20,480
I really liked the great mother's a great
book and I really a great warning that

10
00:00:20,481 --> 00:00:23,630
book and also the origins and
history of consciousnesses.

11
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:25,380
What am I most influential book.

12
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:25,850
Yeah.

13
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:26,810
That's so interesting.

14
00:00:26,811 --> 00:00:28,160
I read an essay you wrote,

15
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:29,910
I don't remember when it was fair.

16
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:31,613
Nyu.

17
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:32,751
Yes.

18
00:00:32,751 --> 00:00:36,290
It's always been staggering to me that
that book hasn't had the impact that it

19
00:00:36,291 --> 00:00:36,831
should have had.

20
00:00:36,831 --> 00:00:39,860
I mean you'll himself in the
preface to that book who wrote that,

21
00:00:39,861 --> 00:00:41,900
that was the book that he
wished that he would've written.

22
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:45,680
It's very much associated with young
symbols of transformation and it was a

23
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:47,390
major influence on my book.

24
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:48,230
Maps of meaning,

25
00:00:48,231 --> 00:00:52,970
which was an attempt to outline
the universal archetypes
that that are portrayed

26
00:00:52,971 --> 00:00:54,680
in the kind of religious
structures that you,

27
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:55,850
that you put forward.

28
00:00:55,851 --> 00:00:57,860
But the thing that I really see happening,

29
00:00:57,861 --> 00:00:59,690
and you can tell me what
you think about this,

30
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:02,270
and in Norman's book consciousness,

31
00:01:02,271 --> 00:01:03,710
which is masculine,

32
00:01:03,711 --> 00:01:06,080
symbolically masculine
for a variety of reasons,

33
00:01:06,081 --> 00:01:06,500
is,

34
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:11,500
is viewed as rising up against the
countervailing force of tragedy from an

35
00:01:12,531 --> 00:01:14,030
underlying co feminine,

36
00:01:14,031 --> 00:01:15,980
Symbolically Feminine unconsciousness,

37
00:01:15,981 --> 00:01:16,191
right?

38
00:01:16,191 --> 00:01:19,340
And it's something that can always be
pulled back into that unconsciousness.

39
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:23,840
That would be the microcosm of that
would be the Friday and eatable mother

40
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:28,870
familial dynamic where the mother was
so over protective and all encompassing

41
00:01:29,241 --> 00:01:31,580
that she interferes with the
development of the competence,

42
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:32,600
not only of her sons,

43
00:01:32,601 --> 00:01:33,710
but also of her daughters,

44
00:01:33,711 --> 00:01:34,880
of her children in general.

45
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:38,690
And it seems to me that that's the
dynamic that's being played out in our

46
00:01:38,691 --> 00:01:39,710
society right now,

47
00:01:39,711 --> 00:01:40,640
is that there's this,

48
00:01:40,910 --> 00:01:41,261
and it's,

49
00:01:41,261 --> 00:01:43,850
it's related in some way that
I don't understand to this,

50
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,720
to this insistence that all forms
of masculine authority or nothing by

51
00:01:47,721 --> 00:01:48,800
tyrannical power.

52
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:53,800
So the symbolic representation
is tyrannical father with
no appreciation for the

53
00:01:55,371 --> 00:02:00,110
benevolent father and benevolent mother
with no appreciation whatsoever for the

54
00:02:00,111 --> 00:02:01,130
tyrannical mother.

55
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:01,521
Right.

56
00:02:01,521 --> 00:02:02,354
And that's that.

57
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:05,720
And cause I thought of videology
is as fragmentary mythologies.

58
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:08,870
That's where they get their archetype
archetypal in psychological power,

59
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:09,351
right?

60
00:02:09,351 --> 00:02:11,180
And so in a balanced representation,

61
00:02:11,181 --> 00:02:15,440
you have the terrible mother and the
great mother as as noise and laid out so

62
00:02:15,441 --> 00:02:18,570
nicely and you have the terrible
father and the great father.

63
00:02:18,571 --> 00:02:21,620
So that's the fact that culture
bangles you have to death well.

64
00:02:21,621 --> 00:02:23,720
It's also promoting
you and developing you.

65
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:25,370
You have to see that as balanced.

66
00:02:25,371 --> 00:02:28,040
And then you have the heroic
and adversarial individual.

67
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:29,960
But in the postmodern world,

68
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:34,010
and this seems to be something that's
increasingly seeping out into the culture

69
00:02:34,011 --> 00:02:34,491
at large,

70
00:02:34,491 --> 00:02:36,710
you have nothing but
the tyrannical father.

71
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:41,750
Nothing but the destructive
force of masculine consciousness
and nothing but the

72
00:02:41,751 --> 00:02:42,584
benevolent,

73
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:43,671
benevolent,

74
00:02:43,671 --> 00:02:44,301
great mother.

75
00:02:44,301 --> 00:02:44,700
And it's a,

76
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:46,220
it's an appalling ideology.

77
00:02:46,221 --> 00:02:49,640
And it seems to me that it's
sucking the vitality went to,

78
00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:51,890
which is exactly what you
would expect symbolically.

79
00:02:51,891 --> 00:02:53,930
It's sucking the vitality of our culture.

80
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:57,320
You see that with the
increasing demolition of,

81
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:58,790
of young men,

82
00:02:59,240 --> 00:02:59,560
um,

83
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:02,620
and not only young men in terms
of their academic performance,

84
00:03:02,621 --> 00:03:06,070
which like they're falling way behind in
elementary school way behind in junior

85
00:03:06,071 --> 00:03:08,500
high and bailing out of
the universities like mad.

86
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:09,700
And so,

87
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:10,021
and I,

88
00:03:10,021 --> 00:03:10,510
I,

89
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:14,410
well the public school
education has become completely
permeated by this kind of

90
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,150
anti male propaganda.

91
00:03:16,151 --> 00:03:16,481
I mean,

92
00:03:16,481 --> 00:03:19,210
and to me public schools are
just a form of imprisonment.

93
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:19,421
You know,

94
00:03:19,421 --> 00:03:22,900
right now are particularly destructive
to young men who have a lot of physical

95
00:03:22,901 --> 00:03:23,530
energy.

96
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:26,230
Right now I identify as transgender,

97
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:27,280
Gay Mike Myself,

98
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:27,520
right?

99
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,353
But I do not,

100
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:33,010
I do not require the entire
world to alter itself okay.

101
00:03:33,011 --> 00:03:33,161
To,

102
00:03:33,161 --> 00:03:35,200
to fit my particular on the self image.

103
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:38,170
I do believe in the power of hormones.

104
00:03:38,171 --> 00:03:42,610
I believe that men exist and women
exist and are biologically different.

105
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:43,480
I think that,

106
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:48,480
I think there is no cure for the cultural
ills right now except if men start

107
00:03:49,811 --> 00:03:54,190
standing up away and demanding that
they be respected as men again.

108
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:56,230
So I got a question about that.

109
00:03:56,410 --> 00:03:56,920
So,

110
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,180
so one of the things,

111
00:03:58,181 --> 00:03:59,950
we did a research project a year ago,

112
00:03:59,951 --> 00:04:03,280
trying to figure out if there was such
a thing as political correctness from a

113
00:04:03,281 --> 00:04:07,840
psychometric perspective to find out is
there the loose aggregation of beliefs

114
00:04:07,841 --> 00:04:09,580
actually clumped together statistically.

115
00:04:09,581 --> 00:04:10,990
And we actually found two factors,

116
00:04:10,991 --> 00:04:11,890
which I won't go into,

117
00:04:11,891 --> 00:04:15,370
but then we looked at things
that predicted adherence to that.

118
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:15,850
Now,

119
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:16,390
uh,

120
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:17,620
politically correct creed,

121
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,780
there were a couple that were surprising.

122
00:04:19,781 --> 00:04:22,210
One was being female was a predictor,

123
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:26,080
the personality attributes
associated with femininity.

124
00:04:26,081 --> 00:04:28,750
So that would be agreeableness and
higher levels of negative emotion.

125
00:04:28,751 --> 00:04:32,650
We're also both independent predictors
but so were symptoms of personality

126
00:04:32,651 --> 00:04:33,460
disorder,

127
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:37,120
which I thought was really important
because part of what I see happening is

128
00:04:37,121 --> 00:04:38,010
that like,

129
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:40,750
I think that women whose
relationship with men have,

130
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:42,760
has been seriously pathologized,

131
00:04:42,761 --> 00:04:47,320
cannot distinguish between male authority
and competence and male tyrannical

132
00:04:47,321 --> 00:04:47,980
power.

133
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:51,670
Like they failed to differentiate because
all they see is the oppressive mail.

134
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:53,860
And then they may have
had experiences that,

135
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:54,900
that,

136
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:55,733
um,

137
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:59,020
there were experiences with men
might've been rough enough so that that

138
00:04:59,021 --> 00:05:00,830
differentiation never occurred because it,

139
00:05:00,831 --> 00:05:01,930
it has to occur.

140
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:05,740
And you have to have a lot of experience
with men and good men do before that

141
00:05:05,741 --> 00:05:06,574
will occur.

142
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:11,080
But it seems to me that we're also
increasingly dominated by a view of

143
00:05:11,081 --> 00:05:15,010
masculinity that's mostly characteristic
of women who have terrible personality

144
00:05:15,011 --> 00:05:18,280
disorders and who are unable to
have healthy relationships with men.

145
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:18,760
Now.

146
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:20,050
But here's the problem.

147
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:21,123
You know,

148
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:23,200
this is something my
wife has pointed out to.

149
00:05:23,201 --> 00:05:23,591
She said,

150
00:05:23,591 --> 00:05:23,771
well,

151
00:05:23,771 --> 00:05:25,600
man are going to have to
stand up for themselves.

152
00:05:25,601 --> 00:05:26,590
But here's the problem.

153
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,680
I know how to stand up to a man who's,

154
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:30,600
who's,

155
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,030
uh,

156
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:33,790
unfairly trespassed against me.

157
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:37,720
And the reason I know that is because the
parameters for my resistance are quite

158
00:05:37,721 --> 00:05:38,554
well defined,

159
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,330
which is we talk,

160
00:05:40,331 --> 00:05:41,164
we argue,

161
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:42,243
we push,

162
00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:43,900
and then it becomes physical,

163
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:44,590
right?

164
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:44,941
Like if,

165
00:05:44,941 --> 00:05:48,010
if we move beyond the
boundaries of civil discourse,

166
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:49,720
we know what the next step is.

167
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:50,021
Okay.

168
00:05:50,021 --> 00:05:51,610
That's forbidden in,

169
00:05:51,611 --> 00:05:53,100
in discourse with women.

170
00:05:53,410 --> 00:05:56,440
And so I don't think that
men can control crazy women.

171
00:05:56,710 --> 00:05:57,290
I don't think,

172
00:05:57,290 --> 00:05:58,370
I really don't believe it.

173
00:05:58,371 --> 00:06:00,800
I think that they have to
throw their hands up in,

174
00:06:00,801 --> 00:06:01,241
in,

175
00:06:01,241 --> 00:06:02,060
in,

176
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:02,780
in what?

177
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:03,350
In,

178
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:03,920
in.

179
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,390
It's not even disbelief.

180
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:07,040
It's that the cultural,

181
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:10,940
there's no step forward that you can
take under those circumstances because if

182
00:06:10,941 --> 00:06:13,190
the man is offensive
enough and crazy enough,

183
00:06:13,450 --> 00:06:15,950
the reaction becomes physical right away.

184
00:06:15,951 --> 00:06:20,300
Or at least the threat is there and when
men are talking to each other in any

185
00:06:20,301 --> 00:06:21,200
serious manner,

186
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:24,350
that underlying thread and
physicality is always there,

187
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:27,950
especially if it's a real conversation
and keeps the thing civilized to some

188
00:06:27,951 --> 00:06:28,730
degree.

189
00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:28,941
You know,

190
00:06:28,941 --> 00:06:33,470
if you're talking to a man who wouldn't
fight with you under any circumstances

191
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:34,304
whatsoever,

192
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:37,580
then you're talking to someone to
whom you have absolutely no respect,

193
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:39,240
but I can't see any way.

194
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,100
For example,

195
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:40,431
there's a,

196
00:06:40,431 --> 00:06:45,431
there's a woman in in Toronto who's
been organizing this movement,

197
00:06:45,471 --> 00:06:48,440
let's say against me and some other people
who are going to do with free speech

198
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:54,160
event and she managed to organize quite
effectively and she's quite ofensive.

199
00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:55,431
You might say,

200
00:06:55,431 --> 00:06:56,750
she compared us to Nazis,

201
00:06:56,751 --> 00:06:57,381
for example,

202
00:06:57,381 --> 00:06:57,770
which,

203
00:06:57,770 --> 00:06:58,011
you know,

204
00:06:58,011 --> 00:07:00,080
publicly using the swastika,

205
00:07:00,081 --> 00:07:02,330
which wasn't really something
I was all that fond of,

206
00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:03,430
but I,

207
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:08,440
I'm defenseless against
that kind of female insanity
because the techniques that

208
00:07:09,171 --> 00:07:13,100
I would use against a man
who was employing those
tactics are forbidden to me.

209
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:14,300
So I don't know,

210
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:18,560
like it seems to me that it isn't man
that have to stand up and say enough of

211
00:07:18,561 --> 00:07:18,830
this,

212
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:20,360
even though that is what they should do.

213
00:07:20,361 --> 00:07:24,740
It seems to me that it's saying women
who have to stand up against their crazy

214
00:07:24,741 --> 00:07:25,700
sisters and say,

215
00:07:25,701 --> 00:07:26,001
look,

216
00:07:26,001 --> 00:07:29,390
enough of that enough man
hating enough pathology,

217
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:32,030
enough bringing disgrace on us as a,

218
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,140
as a gender.

219
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,420
But the problem there,

220
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:37,120
and then I'll start my little tirade,

221
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:42,020
is that most of the women I know who
are sane are busy doing same things,

222
00:07:42,021 --> 00:07:42,321
right?

223
00:07:42,321 --> 00:07:42,771
They're off.

224
00:07:42,771 --> 00:07:43,670
They have their career,

225
00:07:43,671 --> 00:07:44,510
they have their family,

226
00:07:44,511 --> 00:07:48,080
they're quite occupied and they don't
seem to have the time or maybe even the

227
00:07:48,081 --> 00:07:49,630
interest to go after there.

228
00:07:49,810 --> 00:07:51,710
They're crazy harpy sisters.

229
00:07:51,711 --> 00:07:54,160
And so I don't see any
regulating force for that,

230
00:07:54,370 --> 00:07:55,880
that terrible femininity.

231
00:07:55,881 --> 00:08:00,881
And it seems to me to be invading the
culture and undermining the masculine

232
00:08:02,450 --> 00:08:04,250
power of the culture in a way that's,

233
00:08:04,370 --> 00:08:05,300
I think fatal.

234
00:08:05,301 --> 00:08:06,160
I really do believe that.

235
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:07,060
I too,

236
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:07,990
I too believe that these are,

237
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:11,130
this is symptomatic of the
decline of Western culture and,

238
00:08:11,131 --> 00:08:11,411
and we,

239
00:08:11,411 --> 00:08:11,631
and,

240
00:08:11,631 --> 00:08:13,210
and it will just go down flat.

241
00:08:13,211 --> 00:08:14,830
I don't think people realize that,

242
00:08:14,831 --> 00:08:15,290
you know,

243
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:17,050
masculinity is still exists.

244
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:17,560
Okay.

245
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:20,670
In the world as a code among jihadists.

246
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:21,100
Okay.

247
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:23,590
And when you have passionate masculinity.

248
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:24,130
Okay.

249
00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:25,510
Circling the borders,

250
00:08:25,511 --> 00:08:27,790
like the huns in the vandals
during the Roman empire,

251
00:08:27,791 --> 00:08:28,660
that that's what I see.

252
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:30,910
I see this culture rotting from within.

253
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:31,330
Okay.

254
00:08:31,330 --> 00:08:32,400
And this Oh,

255
00:08:32,430 --> 00:08:32,981
link itself,

256
00:08:32,981 --> 00:08:36,470
literally now my island overview
of why we're having these problems.

257
00:08:36,471 --> 00:08:37,060
So I,

258
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:40,030
and it comes from the fact that I'm
the product of an immigrant family.

259
00:08:40,031 --> 00:08:43,900
All four of my grandparents and
my mother were born in Italy.

260
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:47,500
So I remember from my earliest years in
this factory town in upstate New York

261
00:08:47,501 --> 00:08:47,850
where,

262
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:50,050
but my relatives came to
work in the shoe factory.

263
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,760
I can remember still.

264
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:52,450
Okay.

265
00:08:52,450 --> 00:08:52,721
They,

266
00:08:52,721 --> 00:08:54,880
the life of the agrarian era.

267
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:55,111
Okay.

268
00:08:55,111 --> 00:08:55,620
Which we now,

269
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:57,210
which was for most of human history,

270
00:08:57,740 --> 00:09:02,740
the agrarian era where there was the
world of men and the world of women and

271
00:09:03,301 --> 00:09:06,210
they sex has had very little
to do with each other.

272
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:09,450
Each had power and
status and its own realm.

273
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:10,030
Right?

274
00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:10,200
And,

275
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:10,621
and they,

276
00:09:10,621 --> 00:09:11,810
and they laughed at each other in,

277
00:09:11,811 --> 00:09:12,644
in essence,

278
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:14,880
the way the women had enormous power.

279
00:09:14,881 --> 00:09:15,151
In fact,

280
00:09:15,151 --> 00:09:16,560
the old women rule,

281
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:17,191
not the young,

282
00:09:17,191 --> 00:09:18,420
beautiful woman like today,

283
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,370
but the older you were,

284
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,440
the more you had control
over our everyone,

285
00:09:22,441 --> 00:09:24,360
including the mating and marriage.

286
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:25,423
Um,

287
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:26,580
there were no doctors.

288
00:09:26,581 --> 00:09:26,811
So the,

289
00:09:26,811 --> 00:09:27,040
the,

290
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:27,900
so that you had the,

291
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:28,151
you know,

292
00:09:28,151 --> 00:09:28,261
the,

293
00:09:28,261 --> 00:09:31,740
and the old women were like midwives and
knew all the ins and outs of this and I

294
00:09:31,741 --> 00:09:33,420
inherited knowledge
about pregnancy and all,

295
00:09:33,421 --> 00:09:34,250
all these other things.

296
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:34,770
All right,

297
00:09:34,770 --> 00:09:35,820
I can remember this.

298
00:09:35,821 --> 00:09:36,400
And they say,

299
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:36,590
and,

300
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:40,620
and the joy that women had
with each other all day long.

301
00:09:40,621 --> 00:09:41,070
Okay.

302
00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:42,210
Cooking with each other,

303
00:09:42,211 --> 00:09:42,900
you know what I mean?

304
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:44,600
I companions to each other.

305
00:09:44,610 --> 00:09:45,031
Talking,

306
00:09:45,031 --> 00:09:45,690
conversing.

307
00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:49,320
My mother remembered as a small trial
in Italy when it was time to do the

308
00:09:49,321 --> 00:09:49,980
laundry,

309
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:51,390
they would take the laundry up,

310
00:09:51,391 --> 00:09:51,811
the mount,

311
00:09:51,811 --> 00:09:53,550
up the hill to the fountain,

312
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,120
it will soar,

313
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:54,841
go okay and,

314
00:09:54,841 --> 00:09:55,591
and do it by hand.

315
00:09:55,591 --> 00:09:56,251
They would sing,

316
00:09:56,251 --> 00:09:57,660
they would pick nick and so on.

317
00:09:57,661 --> 00:09:58,050
Right.

318
00:09:58,050 --> 00:10:01,330
And we get a glimpse of that
in the Odyssey when a dcs is,

319
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:01,621
is,

320
00:10:01,621 --> 00:10:04,400
is thrown up naked on the
shorts and fail you all right.

321
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:04,611
And,

322
00:10:04,611 --> 00:10:06,930
and he hears the sound of women,

323
00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:11,070
young women laughing and singing and
it's Nausicaa the princess bringing the

324
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:13,500
women to do the laundry where
he's exactly the same thing.

325
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:14,010
And I,

326
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:14,670
so there was a,

327
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:15,240
each,

328
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:18,120
each gender had its own hierarchy,

329
00:10:18,121 --> 00:10:19,290
its own values,

330
00:10:19,291 --> 00:10:20,310
his own way of talking.

331
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:22,500
And the sex is rarely intersected.

332
00:10:22,501 --> 00:10:24,240
Like I can remember in my childhood,

333
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:25,470
on a holiday,

334
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:26,100
typical,

335
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:27,120
it could be Christmas,

336
00:10:27,121 --> 00:10:28,260
it could be a thanksgiving,

337
00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:28,980
whatever,

338
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:31,530
all the women would be
cooking all day long.

339
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:32,910
Everyone would sit down to eat.

340
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:33,630
Okay.

341
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:34,830
And then after that.

342
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:35,071
Okay.

343
00:10:35,071 --> 00:10:36,750
The women who were retired on monster,

344
00:10:36,751 --> 00:10:38,850
the kitchen and the men would go,

345
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:39,060
I would,

346
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:41,580
I would look into a window
and see all the men,

347
00:10:41,581 --> 00:10:41,911
the men,

348
00:10:41,911 --> 00:10:43,080
would it be all outside,

349
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:45,210
usually gather on the car.

350
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:45,651
Okay.

351
00:10:45,651 --> 00:10:48,900
And then a time when cars didn't work
as well as inner today with the hood up.

352
00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:49,470
Okay.

353
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:51,750
And the men would be standing with
our hands on their hips like that.

354
00:10:51,810 --> 00:10:53,940
Everyone's staring at the engine.

355
00:10:53,970 --> 00:10:54,171
I can,

356
00:10:54,171 --> 00:10:54,840
I went,

357
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:55,010
yeah.

358
00:10:55,010 --> 00:10:55,890
That's how I learned.

359
00:10:55,891 --> 00:10:56,340
Okay.

360
00:10:56,340 --> 00:11:00,090
Men where we refreshing themselves
by studying something technical and

361
00:11:00,091 --> 00:11:03,060
mechanical after being with a
women for during the dinner.

362
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:03,241
Okay.

363
00:11:03,241 --> 00:11:03,740
It's not.

364
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:07,920
So all of these problems of today
are the direct consequence of women's

365
00:11:07,921 --> 00:11:11,250
emancipation and freedom from housework,

366
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:12,750
thanks to capitalism.

367
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:12,961
Okay.

368
00:11:12,961 --> 00:11:15,300
Which made it possible
for women to have jobs.

369
00:11:15,301 --> 00:11:18,150
I said that home for the very
first time in the 19th century,

370
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:21,870
no longer to be dependent on a
husband or father or brother.

371
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:22,380
Right.

372
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:23,730
And so this great,

373
00:11:24,170 --> 00:11:28,770
great thing that's happened to us and
allowing us to be totally as sup and self

374
00:11:28,771 --> 00:11:33,771
supporting independent agents has produced
all this animosity between men and

375
00:11:34,171 --> 00:11:38,070
women because the women women's
feel unhappy women today and the,

376
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:38,913
wherever I go,

377
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:42,390
whether it's Italy or Brazil
or England or America,

378
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:42,620
okay.

379
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:43,620
Or Toronto.

380
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:44,210
Okay.

381
00:11:44,210 --> 00:11:44,390
The,

382
00:11:44,390 --> 00:11:44,671
the,

383
00:11:44,671 --> 00:11:45,000
the,

384
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,760
the upper middle class
professional women are unhappy,

385
00:11:47,761 --> 00:11:48,420
miserable.

386
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:49,710
They want and they don't know what,

387
00:11:49,711 --> 00:11:50,790
why they're unhappy.

388
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:51,780
They want to blame it.

389
00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:52,380
Amen.

390
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:52,850
Okay.

391
00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:54,760
The must change men,

392
00:11:54,761 --> 00:11:58,960
it must become more like women
know that is the wrong way to go.

393
00:11:58,960 --> 00:11:59,231
Okay.

394
00:11:59,231 --> 00:12:00,670
It's when men are men,

395
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:01,300
okay.

396
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:04,240
And understand themselves
as men are secure as men,

397
00:12:04,330 --> 00:12:05,680
then you are going to be happier

398
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:08,410
than a weak man.

399
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:09,461
Absolutely.

400
00:12:09,461 --> 00:12:09,730
Okay.

401
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:11,440
And especially all these quislings okay.

402
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:12,580
Spouting feminists.

403
00:12:12,581 --> 00:12:12,810
Right.

404
00:12:12,810 --> 00:12:13,750
I want to hear that.

405
00:12:13,810 --> 00:12:14,101
Okay.

406
00:12:14,101 --> 00:12:14,920
I mean it makes me sick,

407
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:15,630
but here's the point.

408
00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:16,090
Men,

409
00:12:16,090 --> 00:12:19,900
men and women have never
worked side by side ever.

410
00:12:19,901 --> 00:12:21,070
Maybe under farms.

411
00:12:21,071 --> 00:12:21,251
Okay.

412
00:12:21,251 --> 00:12:23,320
When you were like maybe one
person is in the potato field,

413
00:12:23,321 --> 00:12:25,930
the other ones over here and the
commitment during tomatoes or whatever.

414
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:26,470
Okay.

415
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:26,830
You,

416
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:27,311
you had,

417
00:12:27,311 --> 00:12:28,630
you had families and working,

418
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:29,620
working side by side,

419
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:31,060
exhausted with each other.

420
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:32,130
No time to have it.

421
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,220
Any clash of this.

422
00:12:33,221 --> 00:12:35,800
It was a collaborative
effort on farms and so on.

423
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:40,840
Never in all of human history have men
and women been working side by side and

424
00:12:40,841 --> 00:12:43,960
women are now the pressure
about silicon valley.

425
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,400
They're also sexist.

426
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:46,040
Oh there there's,

427
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:47,740
they don't allow women in and so on.

428
00:12:47,770 --> 00:12:52,330
The men are being men in silicon valley
don't like and the women and the women

429
00:12:52,331 --> 00:12:53,164
are demanding that,

430
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,340
oh this is terrible.

431
00:12:54,341 --> 00:12:56,310
You're being say maybe the sexes.

432
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:56,561
Okay.

433
00:12:56,561 --> 00:12:59,020
Have their own particular
form of rhetoric.

434
00:12:59,021 --> 00:13:01,080
Their own particular form of identity.

435
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:01,600
Okay.

436
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,291
Maybe.

437
00:13:02,291 --> 00:13:02,471
Okay.

438
00:13:02,471 --> 00:13:04,600
We need to re re re re examine.

439
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:04,811
Okay.

440
00:13:04,811 --> 00:13:05,680
This business about,

441
00:13:05,681 --> 00:13:05,801
you know,

442
00:13:05,801 --> 00:13:10,570
they the Ma maybe we have to perhaps
except some degree of tension and conflict

443
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:11,710
between the sexes.

444
00:13:11,711 --> 00:13:12,230
Okay.

445
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:13,420
In a work environment,

446
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:14,500
I don't mean harassment,

447
00:13:14,650 --> 00:13:15,220
I'm sorry.

448
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:19,060
I'm talking about women
feeling disrespected to how
somehow that would their

449
00:13:19,061 --> 00:13:20,260
opinions when they express them.

450
00:13:20,261 --> 00:13:20,710
Okay.

451
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:24,610
Are Not taking seriously or or the the
or even Hillary Clinton is complaining.

452
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:24,861
Oh,

453
00:13:24,861 --> 00:13:26,800
we knew it was a woman
writes something online.

454
00:13:26,830 --> 00:13:28,750
She's attacked immediately and so,

455
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:29,190
well,

456
00:13:29,190 --> 00:13:30,190
everyone's attacked online.

457
00:13:30,191 --> 00:13:31,090
What are you talking about?

458
00:13:31,091 --> 00:13:32,050
The world is tough.

459
00:13:32,170 --> 00:13:33,250
The world is competitive.

460
00:13:33,251 --> 00:13:33,431
Okay.

461
00:13:33,431 --> 00:13:35,050
Identity is honed,

462
00:13:35,051 --> 00:13:35,231
okay.

463
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:36,070
By conflict.

464
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,810
The idea that there should be no conflict,

465
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,190
that we have to be in this bath.

466
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:39,790
Okay.

467
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:40,900
At probation.
