1
00:00:06,310 --> 00:00:09,690
Is this pace from search for the holy
grail.

2
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:13,600
The Holy Grail is a myth that was
constructed in Glenndon and the math

3
00:00:13,601 --> 00:00:15,790
goes something like this.
There was a cop,

4
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:20,910
the grail used to hold Christ's blood
and that cop has a redemptive

5
00:00:21,761 --> 00:00:26,230
significance and it's been lost.
And the night's King Arthur's night to

6
00:00:26,231 --> 00:00:28,480
go off to look for the holy grail or
after this cup.

7
00:00:28,481 --> 00:00:30,070
So it's a redemption story,
right?

8
00:00:30,071 --> 00:00:35,071
It means the world's damned unredeemed.
There's some object that can serve as as

9
00:00:37,211 --> 00:00:40,060
the source of redemption,
the source of nourishment,

10
00:00:40,061 --> 00:00:42,100
say,
thinking about it from a symbolic

11
00:00:42,101 --> 00:00:44,620
perspective,
and it's worthwhile to go on a quest of

12
00:00:44,621 --> 00:00:47,740
that sword.
And the King Arthur's story is set up in

13
00:00:47,741 --> 00:00:49,780
an interesting way because there's a
King Arthur,

14
00:00:49,781 --> 00:00:53,050
but he has all these nights,
these nobles and they all sit at a round

15
00:00:53,051 --> 00:00:55,990
table and they're at a round table
because they're equals.

16
00:00:56,110 --> 00:01:01,110
So although it's a hierarchical story,
there's a motif in it that transcends

17
00:01:01,331 --> 00:01:02,200
the hierarchy.
It says,

18
00:01:02,201 --> 00:01:04,450
well,
yeah,

19
00:01:04,451 --> 00:01:07,960
under normal circumstances,
everyone's in arranged in a hierarchy,

20
00:01:07,961 --> 00:01:10,750
but when you're out to seek whatever you
need,

21
00:01:10,751 --> 00:01:12,760
then everyone's an equal.
And so fine.

22
00:01:12,761 --> 00:01:15,790
So they sit at the round table and then
they go off to search for the holy

23
00:01:15,791 --> 00:01:18,250
grail.
And the story opens with a very

24
00:01:18,251 --> 00:01:20,950
interesting Motif,
which is the nights look at the forest

25
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:25,900
and then they try to find the part that
looks the darkest to them and then they

26
00:01:25,901 --> 00:01:28,450
go that way.
That's the marker for their mission,

27
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:32,380
right to go to the darkest place.
And of course each night goes off in a

28
00:01:32,381 --> 00:01:36,160
different direction because the world
looks slightly different to each night.

29
00:01:36,161 --> 00:01:40,570
So objectively speaking they're going to
a different place,

30
00:01:40,571 --> 00:01:43,330
but psychologically speaking they're
going to the same place.

31
00:01:43,331 --> 00:01:47,230
Right in that place I suppose is being
represented in mythology and literature

32
00:01:47,231 --> 00:01:50,620
is the heart of darkness.
And if you're ever curious about why

33
00:01:50,621 --> 00:01:54,790
people aren't enlightened,
since it seems to be a possibility,

34
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:59,380
you can always think about the story of
King Arthur and the knights of the holy

35
00:01:59,381 --> 00:02:01,660
grail and think,
well do you really want to enter the

36
00:02:01,661 --> 00:02:04,150
forest at the darkest place?
And that's what that is.

37
00:02:04,151 --> 00:02:05,500
Of course.
No,

38
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:09,580
because the darkest place means
precisely that place you least want to

39
00:02:09,581 --> 00:02:11,380
go.
And it's the same for everyone.

40
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:19,920
So then I have this little nephew,
although he's almost 15 now,

41
00:02:19,921 --> 00:02:21,960
he had this dream when he was four years
old.

42
00:02:21,961 --> 00:02:26,961
And the background to the dream is this,
he was waking up in the middle of the

43
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:32,210
night for months screaming,
he had night terrors and this went on

44
00:02:32,251 --> 00:02:35,160
for like six months.
And what was happening in his life was

45
00:02:35,161 --> 00:02:37,500
two fold.
There was some instability in his family

46
00:02:37,501 --> 00:02:39,930
because his parents got divorced about a
year after that.

47
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:43,890
And also he was at the transition point
from staying at home to going to

48
00:02:43,891 --> 00:02:45,130
kindergarten.
So you know,

49
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:48,360
not only was he making the big move out
there into the terrible world,

50
00:02:48,361 --> 00:02:53,361
but the stable point from which he might
like to have moved was shaky.

51
00:02:53,431 --> 00:02:55,500
So you know,
he wasn't having that great a time.

52
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:59,320
So anyways,
he's screaming away at night and this is

53
00:02:59,321 --> 00:03:00,370
pretty unsettling,
right?

54
00:03:00,371 --> 00:03:01,750
Cause night terrors are no joke.

55
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:04,600
And so he's upset about it.
His mom's upset about it and so I'm

56
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:06,310
watching him and he's running around the
house.

57
00:03:06,311 --> 00:03:08,320
He's only about this high,
very verbal kid.

58
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:12,520
And he's got this night hat on in this
sword and the shield and he's running

59
00:03:12,521 --> 00:03:16,240
around the house being a night and at
night he takes his night hack and his

60
00:03:16,241 --> 00:03:18,060
shield and his sword Tibet.
Thank,

61
00:03:18,061 --> 00:03:21,160
oh that's pretty cool.
And you can see how that makes sense,

62
00:03:21,161 --> 00:03:23,380
right?
And you can see how it's an inactive

63
00:03:23,381 --> 00:03:28,381
reality cause children enact or act out
their reality before they can explicitly

64
00:03:28,571 --> 00:03:33,571
understand it just like we do.
And so I'm staying there.

65
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,670
One night he wakes up and he has it,
you know,

66
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:38,410
one of these fits and then the next
morning it comes to breakfast.

67
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:39,520
And I said,
hey,

68
00:03:39,521 --> 00:03:41,410
did you have any dreams last night?
And he goes,

69
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:42,910
yeah,
I had a dream.

70
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:44,860
I said,
well tell us the dream.

71
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:47,470
And there's six adults sitting around
the table.

72
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,240
And then he says,
okay,

73
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:52,600
I,
I was out in this field and I was

74
00:03:52,601 --> 00:03:56,620
surrounded by beat dwarves and they came
up to my knees.

75
00:03:56,830 --> 00:03:58,690
And so these doors,
they had no arms,

76
00:03:58,691 --> 00:04:02,620
they just had shoulders and powerful
legs and they're all covered with hair.

77
00:04:02,621 --> 00:04:05,080
And they had a cross shaved on the top
of their head and they were all covered

78
00:04:05,081 --> 00:04:07,750
with grease.
And everywhere I went these doors would

79
00:04:07,751 --> 00:04:11,400
jump up with their beaks and bite me.
And we're looking at,

80
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:14,770
I'm like,
that accounts for the night terrors,

81
00:04:14,771 --> 00:04:16,960
right?
And so then he says,

82
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,550
yeah,
and there's more to it too.

83
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:21,010
If you,
if you looked in the background behind

84
00:04:21,011 --> 00:04:23,890
all the doors,
there was a dragon way in the background

85
00:04:23,891 --> 00:04:27,640
and it was puffing out fire and smoke
and every time it puffed out fire and

86
00:04:27,641 --> 00:04:31,180
smoke a whole bunch more of these
dwarves would get made.

87
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:33,820
And you think that's pretty cool.
That's a hydra story,

88
00:04:33,821 --> 00:04:35,920
right?
Remember the story of the Hydra,

89
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:37,930
you cut off one head,
two more grows.

90
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,000
It's one of Hercules,
uh,

91
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:43,000
trials.
And that's an observation about the

92
00:04:43,001 --> 00:04:45,280
world,
which is you solve one problem and like

93
00:04:45,281 --> 00:04:47,500
two more problems pop up and then you
solve those.

94
00:04:47,501 --> 00:04:48,670
And anyways,
he says,

95
00:04:48,671 --> 00:04:50,440
okay,
well I've got this dragon back there.

96
00:04:50,441 --> 00:04:52,180
And so this is his problem,
right?

97
00:04:52,181 --> 00:04:55,000
He's being eaten by beat dwarves and
that's not good.

98
00:04:55,001 --> 00:04:58,510
And there's not much sense fighting them
off because there's just more of a made

99
00:04:58,511 --> 00:05:01,120
every time this thing lurking in the
background breeds.

100
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,610
So I said,
what could you do about that?

101
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:07,750
It's like his brain was working all
these ideas around and he'd heard lots

102
00:05:07,751 --> 00:05:11,500
of Disney stories and had lots of books
read to them and had abstracted out a

103
00:05:11,501 --> 00:05:14,230
lot of information,
but he hadn't quite got it right.

104
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:15,760
And it was all seeding around in his
head.

105
00:05:15,761 --> 00:05:17,860
And I just said,
well what could you do?

106
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:19,360
Tap.
And he went,

107
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,500
oh,
I know what I could do.

108
00:05:20,501 --> 00:05:23,380
I could take my sword and I'd get my
dad,

109
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:25,170
which is a good notion,
right?

110
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:27,670
Cause he's small.
And then I jump up on the dragon and I'd

111
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:30,940
pop out both of its eyes with the sword
so it couldn't see me.

112
00:05:30,941 --> 00:05:35,840
And then I'd go down its throat to the
box where the fire came out and then I

113
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:38,440
carve a piece out of the box and I'd use
that as a shield.

114
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:40,450
And I thought,
great,

115
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:43,330
you really got the story and the story.
Something like this,

116
00:05:43,331 --> 00:05:46,120
right?
If you're being plagued by midget dwarfs

117
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:50,200
and you wipe them out and they keep
multiplying while you're obviously

118
00:05:50,201 --> 00:05:51,580
aiming at the wrong target,
right?

119
00:05:51,581 --> 00:05:53,230
You should be going to their source.

120
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:56,350
So he went after the dragon,
but not only after the dragon,

121
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:58,250
he went right down the throat of the
Dragon,

122
00:05:58,251 --> 00:05:59,180
which is,
you know,

123
00:05:59,181 --> 00:06:01,910
a fairly brave thing to do.
And then right to the place where the

124
00:06:01,911 --> 00:06:04,400
fire,
the transforming element was being

125
00:06:04,401 --> 00:06:07,490
produced.
And he took a piece of the device that

126
00:06:07,491 --> 00:06:10,520
made the transforming element and he
used it as a shield.

127
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:12,890
Okay,
well that's really cool.

128
00:06:12,891 --> 00:06:14,540
And the story is better than that I
think.

129
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:16,970
And it's true even so it's not one of
those fake,

130
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:19,450
he was dreaming and then woke up sorta
stories.

131
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:21,890
This actually happened.
He didn't have any more nightmares.

132
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:24,800
So when I checked with his mother
repeatedly after that,

133
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:25,521
because I thought,
well,

134
00:06:25,521 --> 00:06:26,870
this is too good to be true,
right?

135
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:28,970
It's got this terrible night terror
thing.

136
00:06:28,971 --> 00:06:32,060
He does one little mythological dream
thing and bang,

137
00:06:32,061 --> 00:06:33,380
he's,
he's better.

138
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:35,750
But that's the case.
He didn't have any more nightmares after

139
00:06:35,751 --> 00:06:37,570
that.
And I think that's because he don't

140
00:06:37,571 --> 00:06:40,790
almost already got it right.
He's running around like a night.

141
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:46,270
He knew almost just had to be made a
little more explicit and not even not

142
00:06:46,431 --> 00:06:48,690
explicit cause it was still a story.
Uh,

143
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:52,820
he didn't know you should go to the
source of your anxieties,

144
00:06:52,821 --> 00:06:54,860
right to the thing that plagues you the
most.

145
00:06:54,861 --> 00:06:58,700
And you should explore that in detail
until you find the information that it

146
00:06:58,701 --> 00:07:00,410
contains that will protect you against
it.

147
00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:03,920
He couldn't say that,
but he can tell the story and he could

148
00:07:03,921 --> 00:07:06,200
act it out and that looked like it was
good enough.

149
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:10,760
So that's pretty cool.
So he basically,

150
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:12,230
you know,
he managed this,

151
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:16,730
essentially,
he fought the dragon of chaos and pop

152
00:07:16,731 --> 00:07:21,560
back up as what,
as he who can obtain victory over the

153
00:07:21,561 --> 00:07:24,500
dragon of chaos.
And that's a pretty good story because

154
00:07:24,501 --> 00:07:25,610
it says,
well,

155
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:31,430
if your frame of reference gets blown
away by something you don't understand

156
00:07:31,431 --> 00:07:35,570
some new challenge,
and you face the challenge at least

157
00:07:35,571 --> 00:07:38,990
courageously and humility and humbly,
which means you know you're not gonna

158
00:07:38,991 --> 00:07:40,850
run away on,
you still have something to learn,

159
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:44,600
then you can extract something out of
the battle that will enable you to

160
00:07:44,601 --> 00:07:45,260
withstand.
