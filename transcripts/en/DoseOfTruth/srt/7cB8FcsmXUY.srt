1
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:08,970
On the radical left and they're
superficial view,

2
00:00:08,971 --> 00:00:13,080
belief and value on the environment.
How has this influenced by their own raw

3
00:00:13,081 --> 00:00:14,910
emotions inviting,
questionable,

4
00:00:14,911 --> 00:00:17,190
immoral,
and dangerous actions despite good

5
00:00:17,191 --> 00:00:18,630
intentions?
Well,

6
00:00:18,631 --> 00:00:20,970
I don't really buy the whole good
intentions thing.

7
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:23,220
I mean,
I think that it's really hard to have

8
00:00:23,221 --> 00:00:25,270
good intentions.
Like John the,

9
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:30,330
the question I just answered,
you know,

10
00:00:30,331 --> 00:00:32,190
John said,
looking at myself honestly,

11
00:00:32,191 --> 00:00:34,710
I'm deeply envious and resentful of
others happiness.

12
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:38,430
Well,
if you listen to the Lindsay shepherd

13
00:00:38,431 --> 00:00:43,431
recording at Wilfrid laurier university
and you listen to the professors and

14
00:00:44,041 --> 00:00:46,650
that the administrators,
I think that it's,

15
00:00:46,651 --> 00:00:47,360
uh,
it's,

16
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:51,480
it's absurd to start with the
presupposition that they have good

17
00:00:51,481 --> 00:00:53,400
intentions.
I don't think they have good intentions

18
00:00:53,401 --> 00:00:55,050
at all.
So,

19
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:56,671
um,
but you know,

20
00:00:56,671 --> 00:01:00,960
we could give the devil his due and say
that there are people on the left end of

21
00:01:00,961 --> 00:01:01,860
the spectrum,
like,

22
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:04,330
like there are all parts of the spectrum
who are,

23
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:08,790
are trying to do good things,
but having good intentions and figuring

24
00:01:08,791 --> 00:01:13,590
out how to do well in the world are our
good intentions are only the beginning.

25
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:19,370
And people are always influenced by raw
emotions and fuzzy thinking and it's

26
00:01:20,401 --> 00:01:24,840
hard to think critically and it's hard
to plan strategically and it's hard to,

27
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:29,490
to intervene in the world in a way that
doesn't cause trouble,

28
00:01:29,491 --> 00:01:32,640
which is partly why I recommend to
people that they start local,

29
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:36,900
you know,
you can't even trust your own good

30
00:01:36,901 --> 00:01:40,890
intentions to some degree because you
have to test out what you do when you

31
00:01:40,891 --> 00:01:44,700
have good intentions and see if it
actually produces the result that's

32
00:01:44,701 --> 00:01:48,750
intended.
But I wouldn't make the case to begin

33
00:01:48,751 --> 00:01:50,080
with that.
Um,

34
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:52,500
especially on the radical end of the
left,

35
00:01:52,501 --> 00:01:55,350
I think it's unbelievably motivated by
resentment.
