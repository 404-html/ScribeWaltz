1
00:00:06,610 --> 00:00:06,871
Yeah.

2
00:00:06,871 --> 00:00:10,930
Well the problem is that what defines
risk is often defined by her behavior.

3
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:14,170
The least risky thing is
what everyone is doing.

4
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:15,890
Like if you're in a hurry,

5
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:16,870
that's certainly the case.

6
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:20,170
The least risky thing is to be in the
middle of what everyone else in the herd

7
00:00:20,171 --> 00:00:20,830
is doing.

8
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:24,580
Creditors can't pick you off there
and people act like that all the time.

9
00:00:24,581 --> 00:00:25,320
And so,

10
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:25,570
you know,

11
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:30,190
we'll stock market investment like Michael
Risky when hardly anyone is doing it

12
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:34,000
because the way that your brain is judging
risk is by the number of people doing

13
00:00:34,001 --> 00:00:34,510
it.

14
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:35,860
But as soon as everyone's doing it,

15
00:00:35,861 --> 00:00:39,160
the risky thing is to be left behind
because if you're left behind,

16
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:41,950
predators will get you
your the straggling sheet.

17
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:46,780
And so what that means is the definition
of what constitutes conservative

18
00:00:46,781 --> 00:00:49,630
changes as mass behavior changes.

19
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:51,153
So,

20
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:57,050
so it isn't even obvious how to advise
people as to what the conservative path

21
00:00:57,700 --> 00:00:58,533
is.

22
00:00:58,960 --> 00:00:59,201
Now,

23
00:00:59,201 --> 00:00:59,820
you know,

24
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:03,700
standard economic adviser
would say diversify.

25
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:05,260
Well,

26
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:06,093
yeah,

27
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:09,160
I'll tell you in the 2008 crash,

28
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:12,550
you could have diversified your money
across multiple markets all over the

29
00:01:12,551 --> 00:01:12,851
world.

30
00:01:12,851 --> 00:01:14,020
Wouldn't help you damn bed,

31
00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:15,280
everything came down.

32
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:17,620
So yeah,

33
00:01:17,621 --> 00:01:18,550
you can diversify,

34
00:01:18,551 --> 00:01:21,430
but that increases your transaction
costs and you have to have quite a bit of

35
00:01:21,431 --> 00:01:23,560
money to do it and you have to
have quite a bit of knowledge.

36
00:01:23,561 --> 00:01:25,910
And so it,

37
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:31,470
the thing is it's not that easy to make
a pile of grain lapsed and that's what

38
00:01:32,081 --> 00:01:33,010
we're always trying to do.

39
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:34,000
You know,

40
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:34,470
it did.

41
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:36,220
This disappears of its own accord.

42
00:01:36,221 --> 00:01:37,031
It deteriorates.

43
00:01:37,031 --> 00:01:38,680
Money does that with inflation.

44
00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:41,500
People are always trying
to nibble away at it,

45
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:42,970
you know?

46
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:45,820
And then now and then
there's an earthquake and
all the green disappears into

47
00:01:45,821 --> 00:01:46,630
the ground.

48
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:48,610
It's hard to preserve value across time.

49
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:51,010
And you could say that about your body

50
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:52,720
there.

51
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:53,553
It's valuable.

52
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:55,630
Well in the natural state,

53
00:01:55,690 --> 00:01:57,070
wolves would be after it,

54
00:01:57,570 --> 00:01:57,761
you know,

55
00:01:57,761 --> 00:02:02,761
it's hard to preserve value
across time and how you do that.

56
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:05,980
There's no sure fire way of doing it,

57
00:02:06,370 --> 00:02:08,740
conservative way of
doing it that can fail,

58
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:11,860
a risky way of doing it that can succeed.

59
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:16,510
It also depends on what
you mean by success too.

60
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:19,990
Because to judge whether someone's a
winner or loser means you have to set a

61
00:02:19,991 --> 00:02:21,880
priority standards by which to judge them.

62
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:23,440
And that is not simple.

63
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:24,640
You know,

64
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,350
in our culture where
people love celebrities,

65
00:02:26,351 --> 00:02:26,471
they,

66
00:02:26,471 --> 00:02:27,850
I'd love to be a celebrity.

67
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:29,373
Well,

68
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,061
sure,

69
00:02:31,061 --> 00:02:32,020
that's what you think.

70
00:02:32,021 --> 00:02:33,250
But Marilyn Monroe's,

71
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:34,510
it wasn't served well by,

72
00:02:34,511 --> 00:02:36,220
it doesn't really look like Elvis was,

73
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:38,223
um,

74
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:38,561
you know,

75
00:02:38,561 --> 00:02:40,990
there's a long list of
collapsing celebrities.

76
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:43,720
So were they successful?

77
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:48,200
Not by the standards of
reasonable longevity.

78
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:49,850
They were the,

79
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:52,070
they were successful by
Neil young standards.

80
00:02:52,071 --> 00:02:52,670
Right.

81
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:55,190
Better to burn out than to fade away.

82
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:56,120
Okay.

83
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:56,953
Maybe,

84
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:58,550
you know,

85
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:00,530
maybe it's better to burn bright longer,

86
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:02,960
but it's arguable,

87
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:03,320
you know.
