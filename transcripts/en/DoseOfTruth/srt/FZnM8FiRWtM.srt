1
00:00:06,730 --> 00:00:06,881
Well,

2
00:00:06,881 --> 00:00:09,280
what I'm worried about also
in this age of social media,

3
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:10,541
I've noticed as a,

4
00:00:10,541 --> 00:00:12,220
as a teacher in the classroom,

5
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:16,870
that the young people are so used
to communicating now by cell phone,

6
00:00:16,871 --> 00:00:17,081
okay.

7
00:00:17,081 --> 00:00:17,914
Buy iPhone,

8
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:18,840
um,

9
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:23,290
that they're losing body
language and facial expressions.

10
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:23,590
Okay.

11
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:28,340
Which I think is going to compound the
problem with these dating encounters.

12
00:00:28,450 --> 00:00:28,601
Okay.

13
00:00:28,601 --> 00:00:32,770
Because the ability to read
the human face and into,

14
00:00:32,771 --> 00:00:33,071
into,

15
00:00:33,071 --> 00:00:35,860
into read little tiny
inflections of emotion.

16
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:40,000
I think my generation got that from
looking at great foreign films with,

17
00:00:40,001 --> 00:00:40,301
with our,

18
00:00:40,301 --> 00:00:41,530
with our long takes,

19
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:43,900
cause you'd have drawn
Moreau and FM to nerves.

20
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:44,440
Okay.

21
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:46,360
And like a potential romantic encounters.

22
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:51,510
And you could usually see the tiniest
little little inflections that signal

23
00:00:51,851 --> 00:00:53,910
communication or sexual readiness or,

24
00:00:53,911 --> 00:00:56,590
or irony or skepticism
or distance or whatever.

25
00:00:57,060 --> 00:01:02,060
But the inability to read the other
people's intentions that I think this is

26
00:01:02,141 --> 00:01:02,951
going to be a disaster.

27
00:01:02,951 --> 00:01:04,630
I mean I just noticed that,

28
00:01:04,631 --> 00:01:05,440
um,

29
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:06,850
how year by year.

30
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:07,260
Okay.

31
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:10,330
The students are becoming
much more flat affect.

32
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:11,020
Okay.

33
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:13,750
And they themselves complained that
they'll sit in the same room with someone

34
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:15,760
and be texting to each other.

35
00:01:15,790 --> 00:01:16,150
Okay.

36
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:16,810
Yeah.

37
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:17,051
Yeah.

38
00:01:17,051 --> 00:01:17,650
Well there's a,

39
00:01:17,650 --> 00:01:20,440
there's a piece of evidence to
that supports that to some degree.

40
00:01:20,441 --> 00:01:23,860
So women with brothers are
less likely to get raped.

41
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:29,140
And the reason for that is that they've
learned that nonverbal language deeply.

42
00:01:29,141 --> 00:01:29,411
Right.

43
00:01:29,411 --> 00:01:29,860
And they can,

44
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:30,280
they can,

45
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:31,510
they can spot the,

46
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:32,850
I have,

47
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:33,800
I have noticed,

48
00:01:33,801 --> 00:01:34,520
okay.

49
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:34,701
Uh,

50
00:01:34,701 --> 00:01:35,210
in my,

51
00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:36,110
in my career,

52
00:01:36,111 --> 00:01:36,291
okay.

53
00:01:36,291 --> 00:01:36,631
That,

54
00:01:36,631 --> 00:01:39,660
that women who have many brothers okay.

55
00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:41,840
Are very good.

56
00:01:41,841 --> 00:01:42,291
Okay.

57
00:01:42,291 --> 00:01:45,080
As administrators and as business people.

58
00:01:45,081 --> 00:01:45,440
Okay.

59
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:45,860
All right.

60
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:48,530
Because they don't take men seriously.

61
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,100
Okay.

62
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:49,930
They regard,

63
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:50,420
they,

64
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:50,680
they,

65
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:51,590
they saw their brothers,

66
00:01:51,591 --> 00:01:52,760
they think they're brothers aren't jokes.

67
00:01:52,761 --> 00:01:53,180
Okay.

68
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:54,590
But they know how to control men.

69
00:01:54,591 --> 00:01:55,070
Okay.

70
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:55,580
While it,

71
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:57,020
while they still like men.

72
00:01:57,021 --> 00:01:57,360
Okay.

73
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,340
They admire men.

74
00:01:58,380 --> 00:01:58,830
Right.

75
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:01,590
So this is something I
have seen repeatedly.

76
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:06,080
There will be also reflective of the
problem of fewer and fewer siblings.

77
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:06,810
Yes,

78
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:07,570
that's right.

79
00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:07,990
Yeah.

80
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:08,230
Yeah.

81
00:02:08,230 --> 00:02:10,380
And I've noticed this in publishing.

82
00:02:10,381 --> 00:02:10,580
Okay.

83
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:10,980
That,

84
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:11,590
that the,

85
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:12,200
um,

86
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:12,410
the,

87
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:13,580
the women who have job,

88
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:14,880
the job of publicist,

89
00:02:14,881 --> 00:02:15,181
okay.

90
00:02:15,181 --> 00:02:17,490
And writes the Topis as
manager of publicity.

91
00:02:17,491 --> 00:02:18,000
Okay.

92
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,420
Their ability to take charge of men and,

93
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:20,760
and the,

94
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:21,960
and their humor at men,

95
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:22,390
they,

96
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:22,630
and,

97
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:23,030
and,

98
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:23,650
and in,

99
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:27,450
and they have great relationships with
men because they don't have the sense of

100
00:02:27,451 --> 00:02:28,440
resentment in an,

101
00:02:28,441 --> 00:02:28,600
in,

102
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:28,711
in,

103
00:02:28,711 --> 00:02:30,240
in worry and anxiety.

104
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,190
And so they don't see men as aggressors.

105
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:33,053
Okay.

106
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:34,230
And I think that's another thing too,

107
00:02:34,231 --> 00:02:36,300
is that as feminism,

108
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:36,900
um,

109
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:37,321
you know,

110
00:02:37,321 --> 00:02:37,441
uh,

111
00:02:37,441 --> 00:02:38,860
moved into his presence,

112
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:40,440
it's a system of videology.

113
00:02:40,441 --> 00:02:40,980
Okay.

114
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:42,450
It has tended to,

115
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:42,630
uh,

116
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:43,770
denigrate motherhood.

117
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:44,470
Okay.

118
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:48,300
As a lesser order of human
experience and to enshrine,

119
00:02:48,301 --> 00:02:48,601
of course,

120
00:02:48,601 --> 00:02:49,090
abortion.

121
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:51,150
I am 100% of abortion rights.

122
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:51,421
You know,

123
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:54,650
I belong to planned parenthood for
years until I finally rejected it as on

124
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:56,010
branch or the Democratic Party,

125
00:02:56,011 --> 00:02:57,210
my own party and so on.

126
00:02:57,410 --> 00:02:57,800
Um,

127
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,070
but,

128
00:02:58,070 --> 00:03:02,620
but as became excluded as s
feminists and became obsessed okay.

129
00:03:02,621 --> 00:03:03,370
With the,

130
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:03,641
with,

131
00:03:03,641 --> 00:03:05,290
with the work with a professional woman.

132
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:05,920
Okay.

133
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:10,060
I feel that the lessons are that
mothers learn had been lost.

134
00:03:10,061 --> 00:03:10,480
Okay.

135
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:10,691
Yeah.

136
00:03:10,691 --> 00:03:11,190
Two,

137
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:11,371
two,

138
00:03:11,371 --> 00:03:11,680
two,

139
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:11,831
two,

140
00:03:11,831 --> 00:03:12,590
two feminism.

141
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:12,740
Okay.

142
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:15,040
Which is okay if the,

143
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:15,883
the mothers who,

144
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,410
who bear boy children.

145
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:17,950
Okay.

146
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:20,290
Understand the fragility of men,

147
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:21,820
the fragility and boys,

148
00:03:21,821 --> 00:03:22,750
they understand it.

149
00:03:22,751 --> 00:03:23,051
They don't,

150
00:03:23,051 --> 00:03:23,884
they don't seem them.

151
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:24,560
Men,

152
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,860
boys and men as a menace.

153
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:28,960
They understand the
greater strength of women.

154
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:29,530
Okay.

155
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:32,380
So there's this tenderness
and connectedness between the,

156
00:03:32,381 --> 00:03:35,230
between the mother and the boy child.

157
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:35,730
Okay.

158
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:38,020
When motherhood is part of the experience.

159
00:03:38,021 --> 00:03:38,560
Okay.

160
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,380
I'll have women who are discussing gender.

161
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:41,820
So he didn't,

162
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:44,180
it was all we have today
is that this does gender.

163
00:03:44,210 --> 00:03:47,140
The LG has risen up on
campuses where we're all,

164
00:03:47,141 --> 00:03:47,650
none of the,

165
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:48,460
none of the girls know.

166
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:49,540
The students have married,

167
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:50,830
none of them had children.

168
00:03:50,831 --> 00:03:51,310
Okay.

169
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:51,830
And you have,

170
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:52,391
you have women.

171
00:03:52,391 --> 00:03:53,520
Some of them have had children,

172
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:55,030
but a lot of them are lesbians or like,

173
00:03:55,031 --> 00:03:57,610
or like are you on or like
professional women and so on.

174
00:03:57,910 --> 00:03:58,220
So this,

175
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:00,610
this the whole tenderness and forgiving,

176
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,690
forgiving us.

177
00:04:01,691 --> 00:04:02,290
Okay.

178
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:05,800
And encouragement that
women do to two boys.

179
00:04:05,801 --> 00:04:06,280
Okay.

180
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:06,850
The fringes,

181
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:09,040
they don't understand this
hypersensitivity of boys.

182
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:09,870
It's not understood.

183
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:10,300
Okay.

184
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:10,970
Instead button,

185
00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:14,110
boys are seen as somehow
a more privileged.

186
00:04:14,111 --> 00:04:14,590
Okay.

187
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:15,221
And somehow,

188
00:04:15,221 --> 00:04:16,030
you know,

189
00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:16,211
their,

190
00:04:16,211 --> 00:04:16,451
their,

191
00:04:16,451 --> 00:04:16,811
their,

192
00:04:16,811 --> 00:04:17,970
their energy level is,

193
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:19,570
is interpreted as aggression.

194
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,050
Okay.

195
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:21,760
Potential violence and so on.

196
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:22,250
Okay.

197
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:22,710
All right.

198
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:22,870
Uh,

199
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:25,070
so I think that that the,

200
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:26,710
that what we would do the better.

201
00:04:26,711 --> 00:04:26,981
Okay.

202
00:04:26,981 --> 00:04:27,910
If we would have,

203
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:28,900
I have proposed,

204
00:04:28,901 --> 00:04:29,470
okay.

205
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:33,700
That colleges should allow when the
moment a woman has entered has entered.

206
00:04:33,701 --> 00:04:34,240
Okay.

207
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,370
She has entrusted in
that college for life.

208
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:36,940
Okay.

209
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:37,870
And that she,

210
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:41,110
that she should be free to leave.

211
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:41,471
Okay.

212
00:04:41,471 --> 00:04:42,760
To have babies when she,

213
00:04:42,761 --> 00:04:44,080
when her body wants them babies,

214
00:04:44,081 --> 00:04:45,100
when it's healthy to have no.

215
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:45,850
Okay.

216
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:47,230
And then return have,

217
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:50,560
haven't had the occasional course so it
can build up credits and father's going

218
00:04:50,561 --> 00:04:50,711
to be,

219
00:04:50,711 --> 00:04:54,430
you might be able to do it as it as
well and so on to get married women,

220
00:04:54,431 --> 00:04:56,320
women with children into the classroom.

221
00:04:56,500 --> 00:05:00,100
The moment that happens and it's
happened after World War Two.

222
00:05:00,101 --> 00:05:00,311
Okay.

223
00:05:00,311 --> 00:05:00,651
We've had,

224
00:05:00,651 --> 00:05:03,910
he had a lot of married you
guys in the classroom and so on.

225
00:05:03,911 --> 00:05:04,241
Not yet.

226
00:05:04,241 --> 00:05:05,260
And it's not that many women,

227
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,290
the experience of a married
person with a family.

228
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:08,830
Okay.

229
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:10,150
Talking about gender,

230
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,150
but most of the gender stuff
would be laughed out of the room.

231
00:05:13,151 --> 00:05:13,331
Okay.

232
00:05:13,331 --> 00:05:16,930
If you had a real mother in there who
had experienced in child birth and had it

233
00:05:16,931 --> 00:05:19,230
had rained and it was
raising boys and so on.

234
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:20,850
So I think that that's also,

235
00:05:20,851 --> 00:05:21,030
uh,

236
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:21,240
you know,

237
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:23,500
something that has led to this,

238
00:05:23,501 --> 00:05:23,741
this,

239
00:05:23,741 --> 00:05:25,110
this incredible art,

240
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:25,480
you know,

241
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,010
artificiality and,

242
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:27,310
uh,

243
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:28,210
and hysteria.

244
00:05:28,211 --> 00:05:28,780
Okay.

245
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:29,530
Feminist rhetoric.
