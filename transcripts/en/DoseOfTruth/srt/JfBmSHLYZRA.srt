1
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:08,210
And so a lot of initiation rights,

2
00:00:08,211 --> 00:00:09,044
for example,

3
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:13,100
are predicated on the idea that you
take the person out of their childhood

4
00:00:13,101 --> 00:00:13,934
context,

5
00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:18,970
you destroy their personality usually
as a consequence of some traumatic and

6
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:24,030
counter and then you refill them with
the cultural norms and that makes them an

7
00:00:24,411 --> 00:00:25,244
adult.

8
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:25,731
And so,

9
00:00:25,731 --> 00:00:26,001
you know,

10
00:00:26,001 --> 00:00:26,631
to some degree,

11
00:00:26,631 --> 00:00:30,800
that's what you guys are doing in a very
slow way when you make the transition

12
00:00:30,801 --> 00:00:33,930
from high school to university or
the transition from high school to a,

13
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:35,180
to a job.

14
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:35,931
We don't,

15
00:00:35,931 --> 00:00:36,501
in our culture,

16
00:00:36,501 --> 00:00:40,640
we don't have the kind of
abrupt ceremonies though
that are designed to catalyze

17
00:00:40,641 --> 00:00:41,600
that transformation.

18
00:00:41,601 --> 00:00:42,141
And you know,

19
00:00:42,141 --> 00:00:43,310
maybe that's an okay thing.

20
00:00:43,311 --> 00:00:45,800
And then maybe it's not an okay thing.

21
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:46,221
I mean,

22
00:00:46,221 --> 00:00:47,840
one of the things that Freud pointed out,

23
00:00:47,841 --> 00:00:49,520
and he's absolutely right about this,

24
00:00:49,870 --> 00:00:50,703
um,

25
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:54,590
is that because human beings have
such a long dependency period,

26
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:56,810
it's not that easy for us to grow up.

27
00:00:57,170 --> 00:00:59,990
And sometimes it takes a shock
in order for that to happen.

28
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:05,470
And so one of the potential problems with
having a dependency period as long as

29
00:01:06,021 --> 00:01:11,021
the human dependency period is that it
never ends and that you stay immature

30
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:12,163
forever.

31
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:17,320
And really I believe that that's the
central problem that Freud talked about.

32
00:01:17,361 --> 00:01:19,190
And I believe also that
it's a real problem.

33
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:23,240
Now whether Freud formulated
it with precise accuracy,

34
00:01:23,241 --> 00:01:24,140
that's a different story.

35
00:01:24,141 --> 00:01:24,741
But you know,

36
00:01:24,741 --> 00:01:25,970
you gotta give the guy a break,

37
00:01:25,971 --> 00:01:28,010
at least he formulated an and it's.

38
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:31,020
I mean I was much more
impressed with Freud,

39
00:01:31,021 --> 00:01:35,900
you depaul theorizing after I did clinical
work for a long time because a large

40
00:01:35,901 --> 00:01:36,920
number of my patients,

41
00:01:36,921 --> 00:01:39,860
their primary problem is getting
the hell out of their family.

42
00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:40,970
They just can't do it.

43
00:01:40,971 --> 00:01:44,150
And so for them the world is the family.

44
00:01:44,151 --> 00:01:45,410
It's the only thing that matters.

45
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:47,510
It's often parental opinion
or something like that.

46
00:01:47,511 --> 00:01:49,130
They just cannot break free of it.

47
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:50,690
So you know,

48
00:01:50,691 --> 00:01:54,020
initiation ceremonies in part
were designed to catalyze that,

49
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:56,050
that break so that your,

50
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:57,410
your mother in particular,

51
00:01:57,411 --> 00:01:59,000
but also your father to some degree.

52
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:04,160
We're no longer the dominant figures
have influenced your personal mother and

53
00:02:04,161 --> 00:02:07,250
father were no longer that dominant
figures of influence in your life,

54
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:12,670
so because really that's
what he maturation means in
some sense is that when you

55
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:14,090
become an adult,

56
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:19,220
the opinions of your parents are as
important as the opinions of any other

57
00:02:19,221 --> 00:02:21,860
reasonable people that
hypothetically care for you.

58
00:02:21,861 --> 00:02:23,450
But no more important than that.
