Eric says,

2
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:11,940
apologies to the weird question.

3
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:14,640
Have you ever performed
a ritual sacrifice?

4
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:15,863
No,

5
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:17,363
I haven't.

6
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:18,540
And it is a weird question,

7
00:00:18,541 --> 00:00:20,580
although I can understand
why you would ask it.

8
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:29,950
I have performed psychological sacrifices,

9
00:00:29,951 --> 00:00:30,311
you know,

10
00:00:30,311 --> 00:00:35,311
I suppose when I decided
to give up something that I
needed to give up so that I

11
00:00:35,381 --> 00:00:36,910
could move forward into the future.

12
00:00:36,911 --> 00:00:37,270
Right.

13
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:41,560
That certainly happened when I quit
smoking and when I more or less quit

14
00:00:41,561 --> 00:00:42,011
drinking,

15
00:00:42,011 --> 00:00:43,930
I still have a drink
from time to time now,

16
00:00:43,931 --> 00:00:47,140
but I quit for 20 years
and that was a sacrifice.

17
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:50,170
I couldn't continue to drink again.

18
00:00:50,171 --> 00:00:51,520
I said I was from northern Alberta.

19
00:00:51,521 --> 00:00:54,040
It was pretty hard drinking
culture and I really liked alcohol,

20
00:00:54,041 --> 00:00:59,041
but I couldn't drink and write
and do my phd and manage my family

21
00:00:59,261 --> 00:01:00,220
responsibilities.

22
00:01:00,221 --> 00:01:01,150
It was too much.

23
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:03,670
And so I stopped and
that was a good thing.

24
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:05,820
So that was a sacrifice.
