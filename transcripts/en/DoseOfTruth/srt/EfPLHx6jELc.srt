1
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:10,220
Some of you might be familiar
with the central Dallas symbol.

2
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:15,440
It's a symbol of dao and
dao is a very strange word.

3
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:19,400
It doesn't have an easily
translatable single meaning.

4
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:20,300
Um,

5
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:24,650
at least in English it means a variety
of things that means the path of life.

6
00:00:24,651 --> 00:00:25,520
So that would mean the,

7
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:28,430
the path that you take as you
move forward through life,

8
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:30,800
but it would mean more
also the proper path.

9
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:33,110
So it's that it's the
proper path through life.

10
00:00:33,290 --> 00:00:38,210
So the idea dow is a symbol of reality
and one of the things that means is the

11
00:00:38,211 --> 00:00:39,500
path you take through life.

12
00:00:39,501 --> 00:00:44,501
And so there's an implicit idea there
that the fundamental reality of life is

13
00:00:44,511 --> 00:00:46,070
the path you take through life.

14
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:47,900
It's not a materialist idea.

15
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:49,400
It's a different kind of idea.

16
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:53,660
It's the idea that life is a journey while
we're mobile creatures and we're on a

17
00:00:53,661 --> 00:00:58,040
journey and know best way to conceptualize
reality has as the place that you

18
00:00:58,041 --> 00:00:59,060
journey through.

19
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:00,320
And the question is,

20
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:00,801
well,

21
00:01:00,801 --> 00:01:02,150
what are the elements?

22
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:05,570
What are the constituent elements of
the place that you journey through?

23
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,040
Cause that's also part of Dow.

24
00:01:07,041 --> 00:01:09,650
And The Dallas believed that
that's the Yin and Yang,

25
00:01:09,651 --> 00:01:14,120
and Yin is the black serpent because
those are two serpent's head to head that

26
00:01:14,121 --> 00:01:15,800
make up the totality of the world.

27
00:01:15,801 --> 00:01:20,150
And the black serpent is
Yin and Yang is feminine.

28
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:21,590
Classically speaking,

29
00:01:21,591 --> 00:01:22,760
from the Dallas perspective,

30
00:01:22,761 --> 00:01:24,920
it's a symbolic representation.

31
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:28,010
It doesn't mean that women
are Yin and that men,

32
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:28,760
men aren't.

33
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:29,541
It's not that.

34
00:01:29,541 --> 00:01:34,541
It's an attempt to use sexual symbolism
to represent a deeper underlying

35
00:01:35,001 --> 00:01:35,810
reality.

36
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:39,530
And Yang is masculine
in his dark and night.

37
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:44,560
And there's a white.in the black
serpent and there's a black.in the white

38
00:01:44,841 --> 00:01:45,231
serpent.

39
00:01:45,231 --> 00:01:48,320
The white serpent is the
daytime and masculinity,

40
00:01:48,321 --> 00:01:52,550
and it's the interplay between those two
things that make up reality and one can

41
00:01:52,551 --> 00:01:54,470
transform into the other at any moment.

42
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:57,380
And so that's the Taoist idea of reality.

43
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:00,470
And so there's Yin and Yang
and they make up the world.

44
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:03,080
And the question is
perhaps act question is,

45
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:03,441
well,

46
00:02:03,441 --> 00:02:05,270
what exactly does that mean?

47
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:06,920
Well,

48
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,270
it actually means something.

49
00:02:08,271 --> 00:02:12,500
It's a kind of abstraction and
it's actually an incredibly
helpful abstraction.

50
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,900
Once you understand the abstraction,

51
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:18,860
it might be the most real
abstraction there is.

52
00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:21,230
So I'm going to lay out a little bit,

53
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:22,401
a layout for you,

54
00:02:22,401 --> 00:02:24,890
a little bit about what
these two domains refer to,

55
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,820
and then I'm going to make a case that
they're real and then I'm going to tell

56
00:02:28,821 --> 00:02:31,070
you what it means that they're real.

57
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:37,060
So you could think of Yin as chaos.

58
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:41,420
Now we need to know what chaos is now.

59
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:45,320
Chaos is what God made the world
out of at the beginning of time.

60
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:47,630
So one of the things that chaos is,

61
00:02:47,631 --> 00:02:49,880
is it's something like potential.

62
00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:52,130
And so you can imagine,

63
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:55,550
and this is not how we think as modern
people because we tend to think in a

64
00:02:55,551 --> 00:02:56,420
materialist way,

65
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:57,860
but it is how we act.

66
00:02:57,861 --> 00:02:58,940
And as I said already,

67
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:04,440
you act as if you confront potential
and you treat potential as if it's real.

68
00:03:06,581 --> 00:03:11,320
And if your attitude towards it confers
on you a certain moral obligation,

69
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:16,500
which is why you know what people mean
when they say you're not living up to

70
00:03:16,931 --> 00:03:17,764
your potential.

71
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:19,690
No one ever says,

72
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:20,981
well,

73
00:03:20,981 --> 00:03:22,360
what do you mean by potential?

74
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:27,220
Not unless they're being argumentative
because you already know and very few

75
00:03:27,221 --> 00:03:28,054
people say,

76
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:28,301
well,

77
00:03:28,301 --> 00:03:30,310
I'm fully living up to my potential.

78
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:35,520
So you admit to the reality
that undergirds that the
conception that makes that

79
00:03:35,741 --> 00:03:38,140
question of possibility immediately

80
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:42,610
the potential is while
potential is the future.

81
00:03:42,611 --> 00:03:43,450
That's part of it.

82
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:45,850
And we believe in the future.

83
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:49,960
We believe that it exists even though
it isn't here and it's not measurable.

84
00:03:49,961 --> 00:03:50,410
It's,

85
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:55,210
it only exists as a potential
set of realizable possibilities.

86
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:56,500
That's what the future is.

87
00:03:56,501 --> 00:03:58,180
And it's really what we contend with.

88
00:03:58,181 --> 00:04:00,670
We don't really contend
with the present precisely.

89
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:04,720
We Orient Ourselves towards the future
and the future comes at us from every

90
00:04:04,721 --> 00:04:06,370
direction and we,

91
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:07,503
we,

92
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:10,120
we decide as we encounter the future,

93
00:04:10,121 --> 00:04:14,830
which parts of it we're going to interact
with and how we're going to construct

94
00:04:14,831 --> 00:04:17,470
the present and the past as
a consequence of doing that.

95
00:04:17,770 --> 00:04:21,940
And so part of chaos is potential
and that's the positive part.

96
00:04:21,941 --> 00:04:25,060
It's like if you're in a bind,

97
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:26,980
what you look for is potential.

98
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:29,140
Is there another way of
conceptualizing this?

99
00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:30,850
Do I have a different way of,

100
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:33,100
of acting?

101
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:34,750
Can I make another plan?

102
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:38,530
Is there something that I'm not taking
into account that would make this

103
00:04:38,531 --> 00:04:40,270
terrible situation tolerable?

104
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:45,540
That's all an attempt to to call upon
potential and to use it to transfigure a

105
00:04:46,931 --> 00:04:51,730
reality that's intolerable and maybe it's
intolerable because of the way you're

106
00:04:51,731 --> 00:04:52,900
conceptualizing it.

107
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:55,870
Now I'm not being naive about that.

108
00:04:56,140 --> 00:05:00,220
I understand perfectly well that people
can find themselves so badly cornered in

109
00:05:00,221 --> 00:05:03,910
life that they're basically
done no matter what they do.

110
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:09,010
People obviously develop fatal illnesses
and they die and their businesses

111
00:05:09,011 --> 00:05:14,011
collapse and genuinely terrible things
can happen to you that aren't your fault,

112
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,060
that you can't fix.

113
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:19,930
I'm not saying that you can just
gerrymander the world by changing your

114
00:05:19,931 --> 00:05:20,411
attitude.

115
00:05:20,411 --> 00:05:21,900
It's not that straight forward,

116
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:27,480
but I am saying that you have a tremendous
ability to transform the landscape of

117
00:05:29,021 --> 00:05:32,620
possibility that reveals itself in
front of you and that when things are

118
00:05:32,621 --> 00:05:33,280
terrible,

119
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,080
that's your best bet.

120
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,510
It doesn't mean it will succeed.

121
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:40,390
It just means you don't
have a better option.

122
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:42,250
And so chaos,

123
00:05:42,251 --> 00:05:46,690
that potential is also something that
manifests itself in a terrible manner.

124
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:47,890
So imagine this,

125
00:05:47,891 --> 00:05:49,330
this is a good way of thinking about it.

126
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,690
So imagine that you have
an intimate relationship.

127
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:57,760
Let's let's say a marriage and the
marriage predicated on trust and fidelity,

128
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,850
which is a variant of trust.

129
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:07,360
And that the trust and fidelity
is an axiom of your memories.

130
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:09,081
You might think,

131
00:06:09,081 --> 00:06:09,201
well,

132
00:06:09,201 --> 00:06:10,040
what does that mean?

133
00:06:10,041 --> 00:06:10,670
It's like,

134
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:11,120
well,

135
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,110
let's play it out.

136
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:17,290
Imagine you've been married for 10 years
and then your wife tells you that she

137
00:06:17,571 --> 00:06:19,610
has had three affairs,

138
00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:24,050
each of them lasted three years and the
last one has lasted five years and it's

139
00:06:24,051 --> 00:06:25,040
still ongoing.

140
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:26,660
Or maybe you discover that,

141
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:28,303
okay,

142
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:29,660
so then you might say,

143
00:06:29,661 --> 00:06:30,200
well,

144
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,790
what happens then?

145
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:33,411
Well,

146
00:06:33,411 --> 00:06:36,110
what happens is that everything
you thought was wrong,

147
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:37,221
right?

148
00:06:37,221 --> 00:06:41,570
And this is such an interesting thing
because it actually means you had the past

149
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:43,970
and you think the past is fixed.

150
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:45,260
It's done with.

151
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:46,760
That's why it's the past.

152
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:50,510
But all of a sudden you find out that
one of the things that you thought about

153
00:06:50,511 --> 00:06:51,344
the past,

154
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:52,910
and it happens to be a
very important thing,

155
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:55,100
wasn't true at all.

156
00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:59,090
And so what that means is that whole
path that you thought was what it was,

157
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:01,190
wasn't what it was at all.

158
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:06,700
And so it transforms itself from
an actuality into potential.

159
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:12,550
And most of that potential is negative
unless you're relieved that your wife had

160
00:07:12,771 --> 00:07:13,604
an affair.

161
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:14,533
Well,

162
00:07:14,690 --> 00:07:17,090
but that's an important
consideration because you know,

163
00:07:17,091 --> 00:07:22,091
you can imagine a situation where your
marriage is dreadfully unhappy and you're

164
00:07:22,221 --> 00:07:24,500
just looking for an excuse to leave.

165
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,630
It's possible that that revelation,

166
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:28,190
even though it would be shocking,

167
00:07:28,191 --> 00:07:30,470
would also come with a fair bit of relief.

168
00:07:30,471 --> 00:07:31,810
And so this potent,

169
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:33,650
the potential that manifests itself,

170
00:07:33,651 --> 00:07:34,970
even when it's unexpected,

171
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:39,350
it doesn't only necessarily
manifest itself in a negative guys,

172
00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:40,840
it can also free you,

173
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:41,441
you know,

174
00:07:41,441 --> 00:07:41,710
and,

175
00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:43,280
and if your marriage was unhappy,

176
00:07:43,281 --> 00:07:44,840
even if you wanted to cling to it,

177
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:50,080
if your marriage wasn't happy and the
betrayal was revealed and you're divorced

178
00:07:50,721 --> 00:07:52,340
and you set yourself up in two years,

179
00:07:52,341 --> 00:07:54,080
you might be in a better
place than you were.

180
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:56,060
It's not a pathway I'm recommending,

181
00:07:56,061 --> 00:07:56,840
by the way.

182
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:59,330
I'm just saying that it's more
complicated than it looks.

183
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:02,600
That's the introduction
of chaos into order.

184
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:03,591
Right?

185
00:08:03,591 --> 00:08:04,580
And the,

186
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:05,300
the,

187
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:10,300
the oldest story we have is something
like order is susceptible to disruption by

188
00:08:12,321 --> 00:08:15,680
chaos and the human,

189
00:08:16,650 --> 00:08:17,350
the d,

190
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:21,590
the fundamental demand that's made on
the human being is to contend with the

191
00:08:21,591 --> 00:08:23,060
chaos that disrupts order.

192
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:26,360
Not to live in order and
not to live in chaos,

193
00:08:26,361 --> 00:08:29,660
but to be able to contend with
the chaos that disrupts order.

194
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:31,610
And so when you encourage your children,

195
00:08:31,611 --> 00:08:32,444
for example,

196
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:36,740
what you're doing is encouraging them
to become the masters of the chaos that

197
00:08:36,741 --> 00:08:39,650
can disrupt order rather
than Denisons of order,

198
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:42,320
which makes them tyrants
or Denisons of chaos,

199
00:08:42,410 --> 00:08:44,390
which makes them nihilistic and hopeless.

200
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:46,670
So you train your children,

201
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:50,450
you encourage your children and yourself
and your partner if you have any sense

202
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:55,070
to be a master of emergent chaos
and to be able to contend with.

203
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:56,753
And so,

204
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:01,900
so chaos has potential
and it's this disruptive,

205
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:07,410
it's the capacity of the infinite world
to disrupt your finite considerations.

206
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,250
That's another way of looking at it.

207
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:12,730
Another way of looking at it is it's
the serpent in the garden of Eden.

208
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:18,220
And the reason that that story is set up
the way it is is because it's trying to

209
00:09:18,221 --> 00:09:23,221
represent that there's no place
that's so bounded and secure,

210
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:29,220
even if it's set up by God himself that
doesn't have an agent of chaos inside

211
00:09:30,131 --> 00:09:30,820
it.

212
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:34,060
It's exactly the same idea that
the Dallas put forward with their,

213
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:36,190
with their symbolic representation.

214
00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:38,710
It's just portrayed in a different manner.

215
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:40,300
And the question is,

216
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:41,853
well,

217
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:45,850
what do you do in the garden
given that there's a snake in it?

218
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:51,330
And the answer to that is something like
you become the master of snakes and so,

219
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:54,610
and that's a deep idea.

220
00:09:54,610 --> 00:09:58,540
That's the same idea as confronting
the drag and then getting the treasure.

221
00:09:58,810 --> 00:10:03,280
That's the same idea as going to the
bottom of the ocean and rescue your father

222
00:10:03,281 --> 00:10:04,540
from the belly of the whale.

223
00:10:04,930 --> 00:10:09,700
It's the same idea and that's an element
in the greatest of stories in the

224
00:10:09,701 --> 00:10:11,770
greatest of stories is heroic,

225
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:13,210
heroic story.

226
00:10:13,211 --> 00:10:16,540
And the heroic story is to voluntarily
confront the unknown when it manifests

227
00:10:16,541 --> 00:10:20,770
itself and together something of value
as a consequence and to share it with the

228
00:10:20,771 --> 00:10:21,604
community.

229
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:25,420
There isn't a story that's more emblematic
of what it means to be human then

230
00:10:25,421 --> 00:10:28,450
that that that is us.

231
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:30,190
That's our best bet.

232
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:31,533
Okay.

233
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:32,411
All right,

234
00:10:32,411 --> 00:10:33,910
so chaos.

235
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:38,860
Chaos is the catastrophe that
will suddenly enter your life.

236
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:41,800
Chaos is the flood
that's definitely coming.

237
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:46,570
Chaos is the ever present possibility
of apocalypse in your personal life,

238
00:10:46,571 --> 00:10:50,140
in your familiar life and
in this broader social life,

239
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:55,800
chaos is the consequence of your finite
fragility existing in a world that's

240
00:10:56,051 --> 00:10:56,950
beyond you.

241
00:10:57,610 --> 00:10:59,080
Chaos is potential.

242
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:00,970
Chaos is what lies before you.

243
00:11:01,090 --> 00:11:05,590
Chaos is what you can call on when you
need something to rescue yourself from

244
00:11:05,591 --> 00:11:06,940
malfunctioning order.

245
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,550
It's a permanent element of existence.

246
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:11,740
Chaos is what you don't know.

247
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,160
Chaos is what's outside the fire.

248
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:17,890
Chaos is what's outside
the walls of your house.

249
00:11:18,130 --> 00:11:20,830
Chaos is what's outside
the walls of your town.

250
00:11:21,310 --> 00:11:24,430
Chaos is what's outside of
the borders of your country.

251
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:28,870
All of that is chaos and potential

252
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:31,543
order.

253
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:38,800
Order is where you are when what you're
doing is working in the manner that you

254
00:11:39,051 --> 00:11:39,884
intended.

255
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:41,091
Okay.

256
00:11:41,091 --> 00:11:42,830
It's a very specific definition.

257
00:11:43,130 --> 00:11:45,050
How do you know that you
know what you're doing?

258
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,080
Well you don't because you don't know
what you're doing because you don't know

259
00:11:48,081 --> 00:11:48,740
everything.

260
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:52,760
Everything you do is bounded by ignorance
while you still have to operate in the

261
00:11:52,761 --> 00:11:53,380
world.

262
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:58,380
And so what you do is you make finite
plans and the new execute plans and then

263
00:11:58,781 --> 00:12:01,170
you execute strategies to,

264
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,850
to make those plans manifest themselves.

265
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:07,480
And if the plan's manifest
themselves the way that you desired,

266
00:12:07,481 --> 00:12:09,970
then you regard your
knowledge as sufficient.

267
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:12,190
That's your definition of truth.

268
00:12:12,191 --> 00:12:15,640
And it's the only definition of truth
that you can use because you don't have

269
00:12:15,641 --> 00:12:16,840
everything at hand.

270
00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:19,810
And when you're aware what
you're doing is working,

271
00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:22,420
that's order and you might think,

272
00:12:22,421 --> 00:12:22,571
well,

273
00:12:22,571 --> 00:12:26,440
I should just stay there because
that's a comfortable place to be.

274
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:30,730
And there's a certain amount of
truth to that except for one thing.

275
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:32,313
If you've

276
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:40,510
defined a domain of order and
you stand in it and you wait,

277
00:12:41,650 --> 00:12:46,300
the disorder will enter all by
itself because things aren't static.

278
00:12:46,301 --> 00:12:48,130
Things change all the time.

279
00:12:48,131 --> 00:12:53,131
And your attempt to bind yourself within
a static structure is destined to fail

280
00:12:53,770 --> 00:12:56,530
because everything around you is in flux.

281
00:12:56,860 --> 00:13:01,750
And the thing that you've parceled out
as permanent will transform itself across

282
00:13:01,751 --> 00:13:02,440
time.

283
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,430
Here's an example.

284
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:08,680
Let's say you're a perfectly well adapted
11 year old and it's actually possible

285
00:13:08,681 --> 00:13:12,190
to meet 11 year old children are often
very delightful cause they're like adult

286
00:13:12,191 --> 00:13:13,024
children,

287
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:14,350
they're not teenagers.

288
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:16,320
They're like as they're,

289
00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:20,500
they're the most mature form of children
and they can be really delightful

290
00:13:20,501 --> 00:13:21,190
people.

291
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:23,350
And then like three years
later you hate them.

292
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:24,603
And,

293
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:27,430
and the reason for that is that of course,

294
00:13:27,431 --> 00:13:28,720
as soon as they hit puberty,

295
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:31,660
which is the emergence of chaos into the,

296
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:34,500
into the already developed
childhood structured,

297
00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:38,050
it's really the emergence of sexuality
into a structure that didn't have to

298
00:13:38,051 --> 00:13:41,650
adapt to sexuality and maybe even the
emergence of aggression to some degree,

299
00:13:41,651 --> 00:13:42,850
but mostly sexuality.

300
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:46,930
If the child maintains only
the 11 year old personality,

301
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:51,520
by the time they're 16 they're no
longer a delightful 11 year old.

302
00:13:51,521 --> 00:13:53,440
There are very immature 16 year old.

303
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:56,980
And the reason that I'm pointing that
out is because just because something

304
00:13:56,981 --> 00:14:01,300
works for you now doesn't mean it's going
to work for you five years from now.

305
00:14:01,301 --> 00:14:03,460
And so in order to remain stable,

306
00:14:03,461 --> 00:14:05,080
you can't be stagnant.

307
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,430
They're not the same thing.

308
00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:08,740
Stability is a dynamic,

309
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:10,240
Nada,

310
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,470
not something static.

311
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:14,290
And so not only do you
have to be where you are,

312
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:17,980
but you have to be going to where you're
going and you have to be participating

313
00:14:17,981 --> 00:14:19,510
in both of those things actively.

314
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:22,720
So it's stability plus transformation.

315
00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:25,450
And I would say that manifests itself.

316
00:14:25,451 --> 00:14:29,050
You know when you're there because
that manifests itself as meaningful.

317
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:29,980
That's actually the,

318
00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:31,540
the instinct of meaning,

319
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:32,800
which is an instinct.

320
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:37,300
And perhaps the deepest instinct is
precisely the instinct that tells you when

321
00:14:37,301 --> 00:14:39,130
where you are as sufficiently stable,

322
00:14:39,131 --> 00:14:43,660
but you're transforming yourself at a
sufficient rate to keep up with everything

323
00:14:43,661 --> 00:14:44,494
that's changing.

324
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:46,900
And you know that because
if you're at your job,

325
00:14:47,230 --> 00:14:48,370
you might say to yourself,

326
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:49,331
well,

327
00:14:49,331 --> 00:14:50,530
my job is really secure,

328
00:14:50,531 --> 00:14:52,010
but it's not very challenging.

329
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:53,540
And you think,

330
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:55,280
well why do you care about that?

331
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:58,460
It's very secure and answer to that is,

332
00:14:58,461 --> 00:14:58,671
well,

333
00:14:58,671 --> 00:14:59,750
if it's not challenging,

334
00:14:59,751 --> 00:15:00,100
it's,

335
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:01,580
it's deadening in a sense,

336
00:15:01,581 --> 00:15:01,821
right?

337
00:15:01,821 --> 00:15:03,170
The spirit goes out of it.

338
00:15:03,290 --> 00:15:04,430
If it's not challenging,

339
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:05,930
you need to be challenged.

340
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:07,460
And why is that?

341
00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:07,851
Well,

342
00:15:07,851 --> 00:15:08,391
the answer is,

343
00:15:08,391 --> 00:15:08,960
well,

344
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:12,830
tomorrow is coming and whoever you
are now isn't enough for tomorrow.

345
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:17,900
And so today you also have to be preparing
for tomorrow and next week and next

346
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:18,080
year.

347
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:21,590
And if your job isn't challenging
than it isn't doing that for you,

348
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:22,940
and you find it deadening,

349
00:15:22,941 --> 00:15:23,960
not meaningful.

350
00:15:24,170 --> 00:15:28,370
And the reason for that is that it
violates your most essential instinct.

351
00:15:28,371 --> 00:15:31,670
And your most essential instinct
is the instinct for meaning.

352
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:33,590
And it signifies that.

353
00:15:33,830 --> 00:15:37,940
It actually signifies that you have the
balance between chaos and order right

354
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:39,171
deeply.

355
00:15:39,171 --> 00:15:40,004
Right?

356
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:42,230
Which is why it's the most
fundamental of instincts,

357
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:45,440
because chaos in order are
the most real of things.
