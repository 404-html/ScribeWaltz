00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:02,340
Louie waterson here at attic question,

2
00:00:02,341 --> 00:00:05,550
how would you suggest someone who's a
jack of all trades and master of none

3
00:00:05,551 --> 00:00:08,460
conduct themselves while you're
probably high in openness,

4
00:00:08,461 --> 00:00:09,420
high in creativity.

5
00:00:09,421 --> 00:00:11,820
And one of the dangers
of being high creativity,

6
00:00:11,821 --> 00:00:13,680
especially if you're
also high in neuroticism,

7
00:00:13,681 --> 00:00:17,580
is that it's hard for creative people
to catalyze and identity because they're

8
00:00:17,581 --> 00:00:19,200
basically pan like,

9
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:19,861
you know,

10
00:00:19,861 --> 00:00:21,270
like Peter Pan or like,

11
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:22,231
or like Pan,

12
00:00:22,231 --> 00:00:25,830
which means everything that God of the
forest is the god of everything to some

13
00:00:25,831 --> 00:00:26,131
degree.

14
00:00:26,131 --> 00:00:29,430
And the problem with being everything
is that you're also nothing at the same

15
00:00:29,431 --> 00:00:31,110
time because you'd never specialize.

16
00:00:31,111 --> 00:00:33,390
And so I would say that if you're,

17
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:36,960
I think that being a jack of all
trades is pretty damn useful.

18
00:00:36,961 --> 00:00:41,610
But I would also say that it's really
necessary to buckle down and find one

19
00:00:41,611 --> 00:00:45,330
primary mode of discipline
and Jack or Louie,

20
00:00:45,331 --> 00:00:48,210
if you can't figure
out what you should do,

21
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:52,920
then guess just pick something that
you think that you could hit hard and

22
00:00:52,921 --> 00:00:53,700
concentrate on.

23
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:55,020
You don't have to be perfect at it.

24
00:00:55,021 --> 00:00:56,400
You don't even have to get it right,

25
00:00:56,700 --> 00:01:01,200
but pick something rather than nothing
or pick something rather than all things.

26
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:05,280
And then set yourself to
master that because you know,

27
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:06,930
you need to have a,

28
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:07,600
a,

29
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:08,160
um,

30
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:09,150
a discipline,

31
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:10,410
a primary discipline.

32
00:01:10,411 --> 00:01:12,510
It's absolutely necessary
to succeed in life.

33
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:12,870
Now,

34
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:14,400
once you have a primary discipline,

35
00:01:14,401 --> 00:01:15,450
then you can branch out and,

36
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:19,410
and become a multiplicity in your
disciplined approach and then you're

37
00:01:19,411 --> 00:01:21,360
absolutely bloody unstoppable.

38
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:24,180
But you really need that
initial disciplinary routine.

39
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:24,901
You know,

40
00:01:24,901 --> 00:01:26,910
this is something neat you knew up,

41
00:01:26,911 --> 00:01:27,830
knew very well.

42
00:01:27,831 --> 00:01:28,350
Um,

43
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:28,921
he said,

44
00:01:28,921 --> 00:01:29,491
for example,

45
00:01:29,491 --> 00:01:30,720
I just wrote about this today,

46
00:01:30,721 --> 00:01:31,554
that um,

47
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:35,430
it was the long unfreedom of the,

48
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:39,630
of Europe's subjugation to the dogmatic
structures of the Catholic Church that

49
00:01:39,650 --> 00:01:44,650
ennobled the European mind and gave it
the capacity to widely range that it

50
00:01:45,511 --> 00:01:46,560
eventually developed,

51
00:01:46,561 --> 00:01:48,370
but it was that initial subjugation,

52
00:01:48,371 --> 00:01:53,371
not initial voluntary slavery that
produced the discipline that produced the

53
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:56,460
spirit that can then go
out and do other things.

54
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:57,480
And it's really,

55
00:01:57,481 --> 00:02:01,140
really useful to subjugate yourself
something to something voluntarily.

56
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:01,741
You know,

57
00:02:01,741 --> 00:02:06,510
I think that's partly why it's useful to
practice a religious faith because you

58
00:02:06,511 --> 00:02:09,210
subject yourself to a
disciplinary structure that way.

59
00:02:09,211 --> 00:02:10,260
And you might think,

60
00:02:10,261 --> 00:02:11,940
well that's all oppressed
if in all of that.

61
00:02:11,941 --> 00:02:13,050
And of course that's true,

62
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:15,450
but it also makes you disciplined.

63
00:02:15,451 --> 00:02:16,470
And once you're disciplined,

64
00:02:16,471 --> 00:02:16,981
like you're,

65
00:02:16,981 --> 00:02:18,690
you're like a sharpened sword man,

66
00:02:18,691 --> 00:02:20,310
like a well tempered blade.

67
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:22,740
And then you can go out there
and operate in the world.

68
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:23,221
So,

69
00:02:23,221 --> 00:02:24,720
and if you haven't found your passion,

70
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:25,470
then I would say,

71
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:25,621
well,

72
00:02:25,621 --> 00:02:29,460
don't wait around until you find the damn
thing because you may never find it is

73
00:02:29,461 --> 00:02:31,230
pick something and focus on it.

74
00:02:31,231 --> 00:02:31,501
You know?

75
00:02:31,501 --> 00:02:36,450
And if you move strongly and forthrightly
towards it for a number of months at

76
00:02:36,451 --> 00:02:36,811
least,

77
00:02:36,811 --> 00:02:37,950
or even a number of years,

78
00:02:37,951 --> 00:02:39,120
and then you find,

79
00:02:39,121 --> 00:02:40,590
well that wasn't the thing for you,

80
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,420
it isn't going to be a waste to anyways.

81
00:02:42,421 --> 00:02:45,510
Because most of the time the
pursuit of any discipline,

82
00:02:45,511 --> 00:02:46,830
knowledge pays off,

83
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:50,040
even if it doesn't pay off in the
way that you initially expect.
