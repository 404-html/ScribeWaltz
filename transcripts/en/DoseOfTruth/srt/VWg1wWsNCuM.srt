1
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:08,810
Okay,

2
00:00:08,810 --> 00:00:09,643
so

3
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:13,341
now Jacob,

4
00:00:13,341 --> 00:00:14,930
we get the second part of Jacob's story.

5
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:24,790
He goes to meet his uncle Laban and
he meets Rachel there again by a well,

6
00:00:26,450 --> 00:00:27,470
he falls in love button,

7
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:29,090
goes to live with Lebanon.

8
00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:30,800
There are two daughters there,

9
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:32,083
Leah,

10
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:33,320
as well as Rachel.

11
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:37,340
Leah is not a particularly
attractive person.

12
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:39,200
It isn't exactly clear why,

13
00:00:39,201 --> 00:00:40,880
but the story makes it quite clear.

14
00:00:40,881 --> 00:00:45,881
She's definitely the least desirable of
the two daughters and the story makes

15
00:00:46,311 --> 00:00:49,280
reference to her eyes and it isn't clear
if there's something wrong with her

16
00:00:49,281 --> 00:00:52,490
physiologically or if there's
something wrong with her attitude.

17
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:53,331
It's not obvious,

18
00:00:53,331 --> 00:00:54,290
but it doesn't really matter.

19
00:00:54,650 --> 00:00:58,310
The point is she's the older daughter
but she's the less desirable one.

20
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:00,950
Jacob stays a month,

21
00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:05,420
which is the limit of
hospitality in in that time,

22
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:06,860
if you stayed for a month,

23
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:08,990
you were welcomed but you
had to work for your keep.

24
00:01:08,991 --> 00:01:10,490
I think after about three days,

25
00:01:10,491 --> 00:01:11,211
something like that,

26
00:01:11,211 --> 00:01:16,211
which seems rather reasonable and so
he stays a month and then he has a chat

27
00:01:17,451 --> 00:01:19,230
with Labon and he says he's.

28
00:01:19,231 --> 00:01:21,740
He's fallen in love with Rachel
by this time and he says,

29
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:25,880
I'll stay with you and
work for seven years,

30
00:01:25,881 --> 00:01:30,020
and then all we had
Rachel and the band says,

31
00:01:30,021 --> 00:01:30,920
that's fine deal,

32
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:36,280
and then the seven years passes
and there's a wedding ceremony.

33
00:01:36,551 --> 00:01:39,230
It's quite a long thing
and the bride is veiled and

34
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:45,570
the bride goes into the tent with,

35
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:49,170
with Jacob and if I remember
the story correctly,

36
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:51,120
I haven't looked at it for a month or so.

37
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:57,240
Rachel is outside the tent speaking,

38
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:02,480
but Leah is inside the tent and so Jacob
thinks he's getting married to Rachel,

39
00:02:03,241 --> 00:02:06,420
but he's actually getting
married to Leah and this is.

40
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:10,950
It's an inversion a because he's in
the dark like Isaac was when he fooled

41
00:02:10,951 --> 00:02:11,784
Isaac.

42
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:17,100
So now it's Jacobs turned to be in the
dark and he gets betrayed by his uncle

43
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:22,370
and his bride to be Rachel and her sister
in a manner that's broadly parallel to

44
00:02:23,371 --> 00:02:25,660
the trip that he pulled on Esau.

45
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:28,980
And so there is a Karma
notion there which I,

46
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:29,850
which I like,

47
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:30,331
you know,

48
00:02:30,331 --> 00:02:30,601
I mean,

49
00:02:30,601 --> 00:02:32,100
you might think of Karma as a

50
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:35,190
superstitious idea,

51
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:36,383
but.

52
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:40,560
And there are ways of interpreting
it that might make it the case,

53
00:02:40,561 --> 00:02:42,570
but I don't think that's what it is.

54
00:02:42,571 --> 00:02:47,070
It's that no bad deed goes
unpunished at something like that.

55
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:47,923
It's,

56
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:51,581
you know,

57
00:02:51,581 --> 00:02:55,570
maybe you've done something bad to
someone and therefore there's part of you

58
00:02:55,571 --> 00:02:58,180
that feels quite guilty
about that hopefully.

59
00:02:58,570 --> 00:03:03,570
And that part is looking for
punishment to set the stage.

60
00:03:04,871 --> 00:03:05,704
Right?

61
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:06,671
And you might think,

62
00:03:06,671 --> 00:03:07,300
well no,

63
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:09,670
but things are,

64
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:10,451
yes,

65
00:03:10,451 --> 00:03:11,620
unless you're a psychopath,

66
00:03:11,621 --> 00:03:12,730
that's how things work.

67
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,560
If you're interested
in that kind of thing,

68
00:03:14,561 --> 00:03:17,830
you should read Dostoyevsky's crime and
punishment because it's the definitive

69
00:03:17,831 --> 00:03:19,480
study of that sort of phenomena.

70
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:20,110
Right?

71
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:20,980
Because in that book,

72
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:22,610
the main protagonists risk,

73
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:24,520
all Nicole gets away with murder,

74
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:26,350
like he does it successfully.

75
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:27,940
No one suspects him.

76
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:33,240
And he drives himself so crazy with guilt
that he basically falls into the hands

77
00:03:34,211 --> 00:03:34,661
of the police.

78
00:03:34,661 --> 00:03:38,980
He drives himself into the hands of the
police because he can't tolerate what he

79
00:03:38,981 --> 00:03:39,700
did.

80
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:40,181
It's very,

81
00:03:40,181 --> 00:03:40,811
it's amazing.

82
00:03:40,811 --> 00:03:41,920
It's an amazing book.

83
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:42,581
But anyways,

84
00:03:42,581 --> 00:03:43,414
the point is here,

85
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:50,250
Jacob falls prey to the same
sort of crookedness that
he used to ratchet himself

86
00:03:51,821 --> 00:03:56,821
up the ladder and that happens far
more often in life than people think.

87
00:03:57,070 --> 00:04:01,000
And it's really not like he can complain
about it right now if he has any sense.

88
00:04:01,001 --> 00:04:01,840
It's like he does.

89
00:04:01,841 --> 00:04:05,770
He brings Leah out to
see Labon and he says,

90
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:07,593
what's,

91
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:09,340
what's with this sister?

92
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:10,140
You know?

93
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:12,220
And Lebaron basically says to him

94
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:15,160
in our culture,

95
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:19,450
it's the custom to marry
the eldest daughter first,

96
00:04:19,451 --> 00:04:20,830
which is exactly right.

97
00:04:20,831 --> 00:04:21,251
And he said,

98
00:04:21,251 --> 00:04:21,491
well,

99
00:04:21,491 --> 00:04:22,324
it would bring,

100
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:22,660
you know,

101
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:27,070
he's rationalizing obviously because
he's just screwed over Jacob in a major

102
00:04:27,071 --> 00:04:27,790
way,

103
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:31,120
but it's a little late to take it back.

104
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:36,310
The marriage has been consummated and
the ceremony has been complete and all

105
00:04:36,311 --> 00:04:41,311
hell would break out if there was any
attempt to sever the relationship.

106
00:04:41,431 --> 00:04:43,930
So that's how it is.

107
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:48,550
So Leah's married and
Jacob has the wrong wife.

108
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,073
So then,

109
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:55,240
so this is Jacob there you see on the
left he's got the little flowery hat and

110
00:04:55,241 --> 00:04:57,820
he's pointing to Leah
and he's saying like,

111
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:58,540
what?

112
00:04:58,540 --> 00:04:59,470
What's up here?

113
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,680
And loved the band,

114
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:06,101
you know,

115
00:05:06,101 --> 00:05:10,330
La Banda is coupled goat and he's
not really all that sad about it.

116
00:05:10,331 --> 00:05:10,691
In fact,

117
00:05:10,691 --> 00:05:12,000
you can imagine that he's going to go in,

118
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:15,940
so okay.

119
00:05:15,941 --> 00:05:17,800
Then he asked to work another seven years

120
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,880
and he gains Rachel.

121
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:25,060
But because God is a tricky character,

122
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:27,880
there was another twist in this story.

123
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:33,750
Rachel turns out not to be very good
at having children or Rachel and Jacob

124
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:36,490
turned out not to be very
good in having children,

125
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:37,600
but Leah,

126
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:40,180
she's really good at having kids,

127
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:45,730
so she provides Jacob with Reuben,

128
00:05:45,731 --> 00:05:46,450
simeon,

129
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:47,283
Levi,

130
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:47,980
Levi,

131
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:49,360
believe and Judah.

132
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:52,870
And the names of those meanings
of those names are there.

133
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:54,460
Reuben means see a son.

134
00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:56,380
Simeon means hearing the.

135
00:05:56,381 --> 00:05:58,250
I think that was the Lord heard my prayer.

136
00:05:58,251 --> 00:05:59,390
I think that's what that was.

137
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,190
Levi means joined.

138
00:06:01,191 --> 00:06:02,240
Judah means praise too.

139
00:06:02,241 --> 00:06:02,580
Yeah,

140
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:03,413
well,

141
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:07,750
and it's Judah from WHO's
tried Christ arises.

142
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,240
Judah is essentially promoted
to the status of first born.

143
00:06:11,241 --> 00:06:12,260
Later in the story.

144
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:14,390
This is important because Ruben,

145
00:06:14,391 --> 00:06:19,391
simeon and Levy all do something
reprehensible and so Judah gets,

146
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:23,760
gets promoted to firstborn,

147
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:28,870
and that's partly why in the logic of
the narrative that it's from the tribe of

148
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:31,220
Judah that Christ arises,

149
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:32,563
so,

150
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:36,350
so now while this is going on,

151
00:06:36,351 --> 00:06:38,030
Rachel is like suicidal,

152
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:39,070
desperate for children's.

153
00:06:39,071 --> 00:06:43,100
She's jealous of her older sister who's
rather ill favored as we pointed out,

154
00:06:43,101 --> 00:06:48,101
but who seems to be damn good at producing
sons and she's really not happy with

155
00:06:49,371 --> 00:06:49,851
Jacob,

156
00:06:49,851 --> 00:06:52,860
and so she chose him out and
Jacob basically says like,

157
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:53,960
what do you want me to do about it?

158
00:06:53,961 --> 00:06:54,830
I'm not God,

159
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:57,470
which is a reasonable
response I would say,

160
00:06:57,830 --> 00:07:02,240
and so in her desperation
she gives Jacob Bella,

161
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:04,040
who's her maid servant.

162
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:07,730
We've seen that sort of
thing happened before and

163
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:11,480
to bill up produces two children.

164
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,900
Dan and NAF telly.

165
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:16,130
I'm the reason I'm detailing
out all these sons.

166
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:21,160
It's important because Jacob is the
founder of Israel and his sons are the

167
00:07:21,501 --> 00:07:23,120
founder of the 12 tribes,

168
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:26,300
so it's a pivotal moment in the story,

169
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:26,601
right?

170
00:07:26,601 --> 00:07:27,740
It's because he's the.

171
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:30,320
He's the fundamental patriarch of,

172
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:33,830
of those who wrestle with
God because as we'll see,

173
00:07:33,831 --> 00:07:35,360
that's what the name Israel means.

174
00:07:35,361 --> 00:07:36,650
He gets the name Israel.

175
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:38,360
You'll see why in a while,

176
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:39,463
but,

177
00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:40,363
but it's in the,

178
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:44,630
you need to know these genealogies in
this situation because they play an

179
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:47,300
important role in everything
that happens afterwards.

180
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:48,613
So

181
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:52,460
Naftali is the second

182
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:56,690
and her name or his name
means with great wrestling's.

183
00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:58,100
I've wrestled with my sister,

184
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:58,521
right,

185
00:07:58,521 --> 00:08:00,800
contended with her and have prevailed.

186
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:05,900
So that gives you some indication
of the tension in the household.

187
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:09,470
Now Leah is now past bearing children.

188
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:10,191
She gives Jake,

189
00:08:10,191 --> 00:08:10,551
Jacob,

190
00:08:10,551 --> 00:08:15,200
her maid servant Zilpah to
keep up with her sister,

191
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,393
I guess.

192
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:17,383
And uh,

193
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:22,350
now Zilpah bears to children for Jacob.

194
00:08:22,351 --> 00:08:25,550
So he's piling up the kids
left right and center here.

195
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:26,693
I'm,

196
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,280
one of them is named Gad,

197
00:08:28,281 --> 00:08:28,941
good fortune.

198
00:08:28,941 --> 00:08:30,320
And the other is named Asher.

199
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:31,520
Happy or blessed.

200
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:36,290
So there's more rivalry
going on between the sisters.

201
00:08:36,291 --> 00:08:38,450
This is quite an interesting little story.

202
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:39,410
So Ruben,

203
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:41,300
who's Leah's daughter,

204
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:44,630
goes out and looks for mandrakes.

205
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:47,300
Now mandrakes have aphrodisiac property.

206
00:08:47,301 --> 00:08:49,160
So that's a little odd to begin with,

207
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,810
but it doesn't matter.

208
00:08:50,811 --> 00:08:51,710
That's what happens.

209
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:52,573
And uh,

210
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:54,830
Rachel is,

211
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:59,700
Rachel wants the mandrakes because
she's still interested in having some

212
00:08:59,701 --> 00:09:04,380
children and so she bargains with
Leah to give her a night with Jacob in

213
00:09:04,381 --> 00:09:09,381
exchange for the mandrakes and a more
sons emerge as a consequence of that.

214
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:11,843
So,

215
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:14,400
and Rachel find the gifts,

216
00:09:14,401 --> 00:09:19,401
birth Joseph and Joseph plays a key
role in the last story in Genesis,

217
00:09:21,751 --> 00:09:24,720
which I hope we'll get
to in the next lecture.

218
00:09:24,721 --> 00:09:26,790
And then we can close off genesis.

219
00:09:26,791 --> 00:09:27,601
That's the plan.

220
00:09:27,601 --> 00:09:28,434
Anyways.

221
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:33,920
So now Jacob isn't really very happy
about the whole arrangement because he,

222
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:37,230
he's been there 14 years
and he's got two wives.

223
00:09:37,231 --> 00:09:37,981
It's not too bad,

224
00:09:37,981 --> 00:09:38,600
but he,

225
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:38,851
you know,

226
00:09:38,851 --> 00:09:41,760
he got the bargain wasn't exactly clean.

227
00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:45,900
He doesn't really trust law bannon and
there's no reason for him to do so.

228
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:49,980
Lebanon was poor before Jacob came.

229
00:09:49,981 --> 00:09:54,240
Jacob turns out to be a very
useful person to have around.

230
00:09:54,690 --> 00:09:59,160
And so he tells labounty he wants to
leave and go back to his home country and

231
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:01,830
that he'll take the
speckled and spotted cattle,

232
00:10:01,831 --> 00:10:02,730
the brown sheep.

233
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:05,490
And the spotted and speckled
goats from the flock,

234
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:06,810
and they're in the minority.

235
00:10:06,811 --> 00:10:07,860
So that's the idea.

236
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:12,750
And so ban or lab and takes all
those animals out of his flock.

237
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:13,460
So the.

238
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:18,210
There was an idea that the speckled goats
and the brown sheep would breed true.

239
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:23,270
So if you have two male goat and a
female goat and they're both speckled,

240
00:10:24,061 --> 00:10:25,140
they'll have speckled kits.

241
00:10:25,141 --> 00:10:25,951
That's the theory.

242
00:10:25,951 --> 00:10:27,660
And the same with brown sheep.

243
00:10:27,661 --> 00:10:32,220
And so what [inaudible] does is he takes
all the speckled animals out of the

244
00:10:32,221 --> 00:10:33,054
flocks,

245
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:34,230
gives them to his son,

246
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:38,370
and they go three days away with them
so that Jacob is left with the flock.

247
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,480
But with no,

248
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:41,010
with none of these animals.

249
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:43,170
Now the idea was that
all the one newborns,

250
00:10:43,171 --> 00:10:44,130
we're going to be his.

251
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:49,370
And so what Liban is basically done is
set it up so that in principle I'm Jacob

252
00:10:49,681 --> 00:10:51,210
is going to get nothing for his work.

253
00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:56,520
So that's another time when
Jacob experiences betrayal.

254
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:57,271
You know,

255
00:10:57,271 --> 00:11:02,220
it's almost as if God isn't done with
reminding him of the magnitude of what he

256
00:11:02,221 --> 00:11:03,060
did in the past.

257
00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:05,430
That that's the moral of the story.

258
00:11:05,431 --> 00:11:06,264
In some sense,

259
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:08,760
now there's a weird little
twist in the story here.

260
00:11:08,761 --> 00:11:13,740
So what Jacob does is some sympathetic
magic and so when the animals are

261
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:14,633
rotting,

262
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:17,130
he puts speckled objects in front of them,

263
00:11:17,131 --> 00:11:18,780
speckled branches and so forth,

264
00:11:18,930 --> 00:11:21,900
I guess to remind them about what
they're supposed to be producing,

265
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:23,130
something like that.

266
00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:24,091
And it works.

267
00:11:24,091 --> 00:11:27,150
And so all these animals
that laband left are,

268
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:27,841
are,

269
00:11:27,841 --> 00:11:28,410
uh,

270
00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:30,630
producing spotted animals like mad.

271
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:31,790
And so that's,

272
00:11:32,070 --> 00:11:37,070
I guess God's changed his mind and
let Jacob off the hook slightly here.

273
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:40,320
So Sooni was very wealthy,

274
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:42,590
much cattle maid servants,

275
00:11:42,591 --> 00:11:43,231
men servants,

276
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:44,400
Campbell's analysis,

277
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:45,360
laband son,

278
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,070
sons become jealous.

279
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:48,270
And lavonne is outraged.

280
00:11:48,271 --> 00:11:48,600
Well,

281
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:48,931
you know,

282
00:11:48,931 --> 00:11:51,750
obviously there's some competition
there between Jacob and his sons,

283
00:11:51,751 --> 00:11:52,950
which is hardly surprising.

284
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:57,640
And the band played this trick to strip
Jacob of all his property and instead he

285
00:11:57,641 --> 00:11:59,740
got far more than he was
going to get to begin with.

286
00:11:59,741 --> 00:12:01,870
So you can imagine that
spirit a bit annoying.

287
00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:02,741
So Jacob,

288
00:12:02,741 --> 00:12:03,011
thanks.

289
00:12:03,011 --> 00:12:04,030
He better get out of there.

290
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:07,810
So we tell Rachel and
Leah and said unto them,

291
00:12:07,811 --> 00:12:11,440
I see your father's countenance
that it's not toward me as before.

292
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:14,560
But the god of my father has
been with me and you know,

293
00:12:14,561 --> 00:12:15,430
with all my power,

294
00:12:15,431 --> 00:12:19,300
I've served your father and your father
is deceived me and changed my wages 10

295
00:12:19,301 --> 00:12:20,110
times,

296
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:23,920
but God so far has suffered
him not to hurt me if he said,

297
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:26,530
thus the speckled shall be thy wages,

298
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:28,540
then all the cattle bore speckled,

299
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:29,411
and if he said,

300
00:12:29,411 --> 00:12:33,300
thus the ring straight shall be thy
higher than all the cattle board ring

301
00:12:33,301 --> 00:12:34,000
strict.

302
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,800
Thus God has taken away the cattle of
your father and given them to me and they

303
00:12:38,801 --> 00:12:42,930
decided to sneak away and they're
unhappy with the inheritance.

304
00:12:42,931 --> 00:12:44,380
That lack of inheritance from Lebanon.

305
00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:45,670
So as they sneak away,

306
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:50,940
Rachel steals the idols that her father
has in his house and it's not exactly

307
00:12:51,311 --> 00:12:52,300
obvious why.

308
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:54,970
There's a lot of contention
about why she's doing that.

309
00:12:54,971 --> 00:12:56,710
Some of them is to punish him,

310
00:12:57,490 --> 00:13:00,010
to bring with her the
images of her ancestors.

311
00:13:00,011 --> 00:13:00,221
You know,

312
00:13:00,221 --> 00:13:02,260
maybe she's loaned some
moving away from home,

313
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:07,240
just out of spite to show them that
the idols were actually powerless for

314
00:13:07,241 --> 00:13:08,074
protection,

315
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:11,290
to stop her father from dividing
the root of their escape.

316
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:15,360
That last one is the strangest one because
the idea would be that the ban would

317
00:13:15,361 --> 00:13:20,361
have used some sort of ritual with the
idols that would help them infer their

318
00:13:21,401 --> 00:13:23,050
escape route and then could chase them.

319
00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:23,741
So anyways,

320
00:13:23,741 --> 00:13:25,900
that's the range of
speculation about that.

321
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:31,140
I think it sounds to me mostly like a
little act of revenge maybe with a bit of

322
00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:36,340
loneliness mixed in laband pursues them,

323
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:40,390
but God comes into dream to tell
him to leave Jacob unharmed.

324
00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:44,620
Lavonne catches up with them in
reproaches Jacob saying that he would have

325
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:48,820
thrown a great party if he would have
known that they were going to leave,

326
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:49,360
you know,

327
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,040
he didn't want them to
sneak away in the night.

328
00:13:51,041 --> 00:13:54,160
And you can't tell from the
story whether that's true or not.

329
00:13:54,161 --> 00:13:54,790
And you know,

330
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:58,640
these people were pretty rough
and impulsive I would say.

331
00:13:58,641 --> 00:14:02,680
And maybe there is a 50 percent chance
of a slaughter and a 50 percent chance of

332
00:14:02,681 --> 00:14:03,460
a party.

333
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:04,210
Who knows?

334
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:06,040
I've been to parties like that actually.

335
00:14:06,610 --> 00:14:07,443
So

336
00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:13,270
laband complains that his gods are gone
and Jacob says that whoever has them,

337
00:14:13,271 --> 00:14:14,590
he will have them killed.

338
00:14:15,010 --> 00:14:15,761
And Rachel,

339
00:14:15,761 --> 00:14:18,040
who's really quite a sneaky character,

340
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:23,190
all things consider basically claims
that she's having her period and she's

341
00:14:23,471 --> 00:14:28,471
sitting on the carpet with all the
idols underneath and she can't move.

342
00:14:28,721 --> 00:14:30,640
And so they search everywhere
and can't find them.

343
00:14:30,641 --> 00:14:35,380
And she's like laughing away behind her
hand about that sneaky little maneuver.

344
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:36,590
But she,

345
00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:37,511
she doesn't die.

346
00:14:37,511 --> 00:14:38,980
So that's probably a good thing.

347
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,040
So the laband,

348
00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:43,570
she checks everything out,

349
00:14:43,571 --> 00:14:45,490
checks the camp out and
he can't find anything.

350
00:14:45,491 --> 00:14:47,050
So they reconcile.

351
00:14:47,051 --> 00:14:51,750
And so that's the first
reconciliation that Jacob in.

352
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:52,670
It's sort of like

353
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:54,553
the,

354
00:14:58,650 --> 00:15:01,170
what would you say the
Karmic debt has been paid.

355
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:02,610
That's one way of thinking about it.

356
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:06,420
That's so he got punished
for his wrongdoing.

357
00:15:07,290 --> 00:15:09,330
He's learned his lesson perhaps.

358
00:15:10,590 --> 00:15:11,423
And it's,

359
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:12,373
it's,

360
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:13,431
that's good enough.

361
00:15:13,431 --> 00:15:14,510
As far as he's concerned,

362
00:15:14,970 --> 00:15:17,270
he got away good enough
and they make peace.

363
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:18,583
So

364
00:15:21,570 --> 00:15:25,740
then the next thing that happens as
they're traveling is that Jacob was left

365
00:15:25,741 --> 00:15:27,780
alone and there wrestled a man,

366
00:15:28,830 --> 00:15:29,550
man,

367
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:30,180
Angel.

368
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:30,960
God,

369
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,040
it's not clear.

370
00:15:35,010 --> 00:15:38,430
We'll go with angel with him until
the breaking of the day or God.

371
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:40,890
And when he saw that he
prevailed not against him,

372
00:15:40,891 --> 00:15:44,160
he touched the hollow of his thigh and
the hollow of Jacob's thigh was out of

373
00:15:44,161 --> 00:15:46,170
joint as he wrestled with him and he said,

374
00:15:46,171 --> 00:15:47,840
let me go for the day breaks.

375
00:15:48,210 --> 00:15:48,931
And Jacob said,

376
00:15:48,931 --> 00:15:50,910
I will not let you go unless you bless me.

377
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:52,800
And the Angel said unto him,

378
00:15:52,801 --> 00:15:53,670
what is the name?

379
00:15:53,671 --> 00:15:54,990
And Jacob said,

380
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:56,063
Jacob.

381
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:07,831
And the Angel said,

382
00:16:07,831 --> 00:16:10,470
thy name shall no more be called Jacob.

383
00:16:10,471 --> 00:16:11,950
So the supplanter right,

384
00:16:12,330 --> 00:16:17,330
the overthrow her with that
kind of intonation of or
implication of crookedness

385
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,073
but Israel,

386
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:24,200
which means he who wrestles or strive
successfully with God for as a prince,

387
00:16:25,010 --> 00:16:27,930
hast thou power with God and
with men and has prevailed.

388
00:16:28,290 --> 00:16:29,460
That's quite a story.

389
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:30,533
Like it's.

390
00:16:30,810 --> 00:16:31,210
I don't,

391
00:16:31,210 --> 00:16:32,910
I don't know exactly what to make of it.

392
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:36,030
There's obviously a
symbolic level of meaning,

393
00:16:36,031 --> 00:16:40,470
which is that that is what human
beings do in some senses they,

394
00:16:40,770 --> 00:16:41,700
they wrestle.

395
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:46,320
I would say they wrestle with the divine
even with the concept of the divine for

396
00:16:46,321 --> 00:16:47,154
that matter.

397
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:48,353
And,

398
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:51,620
but the question is,

399
00:16:51,621 --> 00:16:52,700
do they prevail?

400
00:16:52,701 --> 00:16:57,230
Like it's kind of odd thing that Jacob
actually seems to win this battle,

401
00:16:57,231 --> 00:16:57,411
right?

402
00:16:57,411 --> 00:17:02,090
Or at least he wins it enough so that
whoever he's wrestling this divine figure

403
00:17:02,091 --> 00:17:05,030
that he's wrestling is willing
to bestow a blessing on him.

404
00:17:05,031 --> 00:17:07,760
I guess maybe that's a
testament to his courage.

405
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:08,930
It's something like that.

406
00:17:09,170 --> 00:17:14,170
Maybe it's an indication that he has
paid for his sin sufficiently so that he

407
00:17:14,541 --> 00:17:16,610
sort of back on the moral high ground.

408
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:17,743
But,

409
00:17:18,050 --> 00:17:23,050
but I think it's really telling that the
transformation of the name from Jacob

410
00:17:23,090 --> 00:17:28,090
Israel and what Israel means is he who
wrestles with God or who struggles with

411
00:17:28,611 --> 00:17:30,170
God and perhaps successfully,

412
00:17:31,370 --> 00:17:34,580
but it's also so interesting that
he actually emerges victorious.

413
00:17:34,990 --> 00:17:35,271
You know,

414
00:17:35,271 --> 00:17:37,700
you wouldn't necessarily think
that that would be a possibility,

415
00:17:37,701 --> 00:17:39,350
especially given you know,

416
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:42,320
God's rather hot headed
nature in the Old Testament.

417
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:44,210
You don't want to mess with him too much,

418
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:45,260
but,

419
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:46,850
but Jacob does it successfully.

420
00:17:46,851 --> 00:17:51,851
But even more importantly is the idea
that whatever Israel constitutes,

421
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:53,101
which would be the say,

422
00:17:53,101 --> 00:17:58,101
the land that Jacob phones is actually
composed of those who wrestle with God.

423
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:04,460
I think that's an amazing idea because
it also seems to me to shed some light on

424
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:08,820
perhaps what was meant
by belief in those days.

425
00:18:08,821 --> 00:18:09,380
You know,

426
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:12,690
like I've often thought of rep
of marriage as a wrestling match,

427
00:18:12,691 --> 00:18:13,170
right?

428
00:18:13,170 --> 00:18:13,861
If you're lucky,

429
00:18:13,861 --> 00:18:15,020
the person that you marry,

430
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:16,440
someone you contend with,

431
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:17,760
it's not exactly.

432
00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:19,290
I don't think it's exactly.

433
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:20,910
It's not tranquil.

434
00:18:20,911 --> 00:18:21,744
Precisely.

435
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:23,280
You know,

436
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,500
you might have noticed
that some of you and,

437
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:26,830
but,

438
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:29,940
but the thing is if you have
something to contend against,

439
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:35,210
then that strengthens you and that's
actually better than having nothing to

440
00:18:35,371 --> 00:18:36,360
contend against.

441
00:18:36,361 --> 00:18:41,361
And so Jacob is the person who's also
strengthened by the necessity of this

442
00:18:42,451 --> 00:18:47,451
contending and that seems to be the proper
relationship with God or the angel is

443
00:18:47,761 --> 00:18:50,010
that contending the battling,

444
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:50,730
right?

445
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:54,510
Rather than some sort of kind of loose,

446
00:18:54,810 --> 00:18:57,300
weak statement of belief.

447
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:58,440
I mean,

448
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:00,600
I'm not trying to denigrate
that to any great degree.

449
00:19:00,601 --> 00:19:03,990
It just doesn't seem like the
right motive conceptualization,

450
00:19:03,991 --> 00:19:04,201
right?

451
00:19:04,201 --> 00:19:05,310
Because human beings aren't,

452
00:19:05,910 --> 00:19:10,910
aren't like that were were contentious
creatures and that's actually seems to be

453
00:19:11,791 --> 00:19:14,400
something that meets with
God's favor in this situation.

454
00:19:14,401 --> 00:19:18,660
So especially given that that's actually
what he names the while the whole

455
00:19:18,661 --> 00:19:23,661
kingdom of the chosen people is the idea
is that that's composed of those who

456
00:19:23,731 --> 00:19:25,530
contend with God.

457
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,030
So that's,

458
00:19:27,050 --> 00:19:29,460
that's a hell of an idea
that that's for sure.

459
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:32,490
And Jacob asked

460
00:19:34,050 --> 00:19:34,651
him and said,

461
00:19:34,651 --> 00:19:36,330
tell me I pray thee thy name.

462
00:19:36,331 --> 00:19:37,164
And he said,

463
00:19:37,390 --> 00:19:39,870
wherefore dos ask after by name.

464
00:19:39,871 --> 00:19:41,370
So there's no that's not happening.

465
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:42,570
And he blessed him there.

466
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:45,060
And Jacob called the place
of the name of that place.

467
00:19:45,090 --> 00:19:49,710
Penile for I or Peniel for I have seen
God face to face in my life is preserved.

468
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:52,320
And he passed over penile.

469
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:54,720
The Sun rose upon him and
he halted upon his thigh.

470
00:19:54,930 --> 00:19:59,790
Now Jacob does walk
away injured from this,

471
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:00,601
right?

472
00:20:00,601 --> 00:20:02,400
So he has a permanent limp after that.

473
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:07,230
And so that's also an indication of just
how dangerous that contention actually

474
00:20:07,231 --> 00:20:07,860
is.

475
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:08,880
Like he gets blast,

476
00:20:08,881 --> 00:20:09,331
he wins,

477
00:20:09,331 --> 00:20:11,100
but he doesn't get away Scot free.
