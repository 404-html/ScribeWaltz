1
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:13,160
Happening at Johns Hopkins Hospital with
the Psilocybin experimenters because

2
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:17,510
one of the most recent things they showed
was that if you take people dying of

3
00:00:17,511 --> 00:00:21,890
cancer and you'd give them cell assignment
and they have a mystical experience,

4
00:00:21,891 --> 00:00:24,800
which is something like an experience
of the Kingdom of God on earth,

5
00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:29,650
but also eternally at the same time that
they lose their fear of death or did

6
00:00:29,651 --> 00:00:29,730
it,

7
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:31,190
at least it's much modified it,

8
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:31,910
you know,

9
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:33,170
that's a hell of a finding.

10
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,033
That's really,

11
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:34,963
you can't just,

12
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:38,860
you can't just walk away from that easily
because that's a hell of a thing to

13
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:39,703
treat.

14
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:40,770
Well,

15
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:41,050
yeah,

16
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:43,720
I have a chapter on that
then in heavens on earth,

17
00:00:43,721 --> 00:00:45,220
on near death experiences.

18
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:46,073
Um,

19
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:47,130
it's so,

20
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:48,460
but we're talking about
two different things.

21
00:00:48,461 --> 00:00:49,170
Um,

22
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:49,561
you know,

23
00:00:49,561 --> 00:00:54,561
the transitioning from life to death in
the most pain free or anxiety reduced

24
00:00:56,801 --> 00:00:57,501
state is,

25
00:00:57,501 --> 00:00:58,000
is more,

26
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:58,833
is progress.

27
00:00:58,930 --> 00:00:59,171
Uh,

28
00:00:59,171 --> 00:00:59,381
you know,

29
00:00:59,381 --> 00:01:00,220
medical progress,

30
00:01:00,221 --> 00:01:03,130
psychological progress or
whatever and I'm all for,

31
00:01:03,131 --> 00:01:03,480
you know,

32
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,680
is psilocybin does it or whatever.

33
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:06,673
Um,

34
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:07,541
then great,

35
00:01:07,541 --> 00:01:08,374
we should do that.

36
00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:10,920
But there's a lot of people
that claim more than that,

37
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:14,740
that this is opening the doors
of perception into another world.

38
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:20,020
It's actually out there and that
those of us had not taken acid.

39
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:21,760
We just simply can't know.

40
00:01:22,570 --> 00:01:23,490
So now we,

41
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:25,600
now we get at this question of truth.

42
00:01:25,601 --> 00:01:26,434
You know,

43
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:30,340
one of my columns and scientific
American and I recently wrote called,

44
00:01:30,341 --> 00:01:31,240
what is truth anyway?

45
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:31,961
I mean,

46
00:01:31,961 --> 00:01:34,150
when I say like I prefer dark,

47
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:36,580
dark chocolate and you
prefer milk chocolate,

48
00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:37,743
you know,

49
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:40,150
there's no truth that is to be discovered.

50
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:41,380
Years is true for you.

51
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:42,191
Mine's Poop for me.

52
00:01:42,191 --> 00:01:45,370
Or I say stairway to heaven as the
greatest rock song of all time.

53
00:01:45,371 --> 00:01:45,780
And you say,

54
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:45,941
no,

55
00:01:45,941 --> 00:01:46,120
no,

56
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:48,190
Freebird is better than
stairway to heaven.

57
00:01:48,191 --> 00:01:49,540
And we argue about that,

58
00:01:49,541 --> 00:01:50,260
but there's no,

59
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:51,580
there's no experiment we're going to run.

60
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,820
And so as we start to
move along these lines,

61
00:01:54,821 --> 00:01:57,640
like when Deepak Chopra
tells me meditation works,

62
00:01:58,390 --> 00:01:58,721
okay,

63
00:01:58,721 --> 00:02:02,110
so if it works for you or
it doesn't work for me,

64
00:02:02,111 --> 00:02:02,291
okay,

65
00:02:02,291 --> 00:02:04,770
those are still in that
state of internal truths.

66
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:06,760
But what we want to know in science,

67
00:02:06,761 --> 00:02:08,230
it doesn't work for everybody.

68
00:02:08,231 --> 00:02:08,381
Or,

69
00:02:08,381 --> 00:02:08,590
you know,

70
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:13,590
67% of people that do an
hour of meditation a day
under these conditions have

71
00:02:13,631 --> 00:02:16,810
reduced stress hormones
and blood pressure.

72
00:02:16,811 --> 00:02:21,280
And so in some measurable way that's
different than just an internal state.

73
00:02:21,281 --> 00:02:23,260
So when we're talking about,

74
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,393
again just to,

75
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:25,000
you know,

76
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:25,601
working on,

77
00:02:25,601 --> 00:02:25,930
towards,

78
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:27,700
towards striving to better ourselves or,

79
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:29,350
or some kind of heaven,

80
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,273
if you mean just,

81
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:31,330
you know,

82
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:33,820
metaphorically so that
I can better myself,

83
00:02:33,821 --> 00:02:37,970
that's different than there was
an actual place you can go to a,

84
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:40,150
that's going to be there after we die.

85
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:43,600
And so I think this is
where scientists go.

86
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:49,830
You also started messing about with the
idea of place in a way that that's the

87
00:02:49,831 --> 00:02:52,410
problem with having discussions
about fundamental realities.

88
00:02:52,411 --> 00:02:52,951
And you know,

89
00:02:52,951 --> 00:02:56,630
when you said another thing that Christ
said was that the Kingdom of Heaven is

90
00:02:56,631 --> 00:02:57,361
spread upon earth,

91
00:02:57,361 --> 00:02:58,470
but men do not see it.

92
00:02:59,400 --> 00:02:59,620
Right?

93
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:00,040
So,

94
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:00,151
and,

95
00:03:00,151 --> 00:03:00,611
and that's,

96
00:03:00,611 --> 00:03:03,970
that's something that's akin to the idea
of that Kingdom of God is within you.

97
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:04,870
Although it's,

98
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:09,820
it's a strange twist on it because it
also adds an element of externalities or

99
00:03:09,821 --> 00:03:10,780
physicality to it.

100
00:03:10,781 --> 00:03:12,610
And an element of immediacy,

101
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,770
not something that's
forestalled into the future.

102
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:16,060
But I wonder,

103
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:16,691
see,

104
00:03:16,691 --> 00:03:18,790
in my wilder moments of speculation,

105
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:23,590
I have this notion that if
things stack up properly,

106
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:27,970
so imagine that you're immersed in a
very deeply meaningful experience and,

107
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:29,050
and it's,

108
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:30,280
it's operating.

109
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:33,970
It's indicating that harmony has been
established between multiple levels of

110
00:03:33,971 --> 00:03:35,110
being simultaneously.

111
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:36,550
I wonder if that can,

112
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:41,350
I wonder if that can put you in a place
that's profound enough or deep enough so

113
00:03:41,351 --> 00:03:45,040
that the structure of time and space
itself starts to warp around that.

114
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:46,443
I mean,

115
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:47,680
I know that that's a,

116
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:49,990
I can't formulate it well,

117
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,330
but there's,

118
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:52,180
there's something,

119
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:55,120
there's something about it that
seems to me to be correct about that,

120
00:03:55,121 --> 00:03:58,090
because people have intimations
of a murder of a mortality,

121
00:03:58,091 --> 00:03:59,650
and they have intimations of,

122
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:00,400
of,

123
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,770
of heavenly and hellish a boats as well.

124
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:03,753
And they're not,

125
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:04,803
they're not,

126
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:07,210
they're not the simple kind of rational,

127
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:08,381
even rational,

128
00:04:08,381 --> 00:04:11,530
fundamentalist beliefs that often people
talk about when they're discussing

129
00:04:11,531 --> 00:04:12,364
religious belief.

130
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:16,180
They're more reflected in
direct experience and it's
not easy to make sense of

131
00:04:16,181 --> 00:04:16,360
them.
