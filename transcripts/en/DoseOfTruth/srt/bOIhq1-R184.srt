1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:01,273
So

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:03,620
let's get rid of the fixes.

3
00:00:03,710 --> 00:00:04,630
I Ita,

4
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:06,850
so sometimes he listed it as a lack of,

5
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:09,760
as you apply critical thinking language.

6
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:13,720
It's almost like it's like a mathematical
problem and the logic association with

7
00:00:13,721 --> 00:00:14,680
contribution of herbs,

8
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:19,810
I feel sometimes they're locking and this
is basic knowledge and kind of put two

9
00:00:19,811 --> 00:00:20,644
and two together.

10
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:23,131
The best way,

11
00:00:23,131 --> 00:00:26,250
the best way to teach people critical
thinking is to teach them to write.

12
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:27,651
And I,

13
00:00:27,651 --> 00:00:29,500
I made this little
thing that I put online.

14
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:30,353
It's,

15
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,360
I don't know if maybe it is
it in the site for 34 website.

16
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:36,000
Did I post that rubric for Essay Writing?

17
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:37,500
I don't think it actually went through.

18
00:00:37,501 --> 00:00:39,700
I think it is still on four 30

19
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:42,300
is it not on four 34 is that not working?

20
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:43,290
It's true.

21
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:44,123
When you were doing it.

22
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:45,443
Oh yeah,

23
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:45,921
I bet.

24
00:00:45,921 --> 00:00:46,151
I bet.

25
00:00:46,151 --> 00:00:46,960
I still found it.

26
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,150
It's still in corporate before 30

27
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:49,011
Oh,

28
00:00:49,011 --> 00:00:49,610
okay.

29
00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:50,600
Well there's an essay.

30
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:51,920
Oh that's too bad.

31
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:57,080
It's not on the site for 34 website even
I didn't cause I updated it anyways.

32
00:00:57,081 --> 00:00:58,380
I have this guide to writing.

33
00:00:58,390 --> 00:01:01,130
It's that if it isn't
on the four 34 website,

34
00:01:01,131 --> 00:01:03,350
it is definitely on the four 30 website.

35
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:04,663
And uh,

36
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:08,870
it steps people through the process of
writing because what's happened now,

37
00:01:08,871 --> 00:01:11,510
it's very hard to teach people to
write because it's unbelievably time

38
00:01:11,511 --> 00:01:12,344
intensive.

39
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:16,220
And like writing marketing a
good essay that's really easy.

40
00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:17,360
Check a,

41
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:18,890
you did everything right,

42
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:19,340
right.

43
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:20,710
Marking a bad essay.

44
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:21,650
Oh my God,

45
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:22,611
the words are wrong.

46
00:01:22,611 --> 00:01:23,421
The phrases are wrong,

47
00:01:23,421 --> 00:01:24,260
the sentences are wrong.

48
00:01:24,261 --> 00:01:25,880
They're not ordered
right in the paragraphs.

49
00:01:25,970 --> 00:01:28,820
The paragraphs aren't coherent and
the whole thing makes no sense.

50
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:32,270
So trying to tell the
person what they did wrong,

51
00:01:32,271 --> 00:01:32,601
it's like,

52
00:01:32,601 --> 00:01:32,811
Whoa,

53
00:01:32,811 --> 00:01:33,800
you did everything wrong.

54
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:35,600
Everything about this essay is wrong.

55
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:38,030
Well that's not helpful either.

56
00:01:38,031 --> 00:01:38,864
You have to

57
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:43,920
find the few little things they did half
right and you have to teach them what

58
00:01:43,921 --> 00:01:44,700
they did wrong.

59
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:46,260
It's really expensive.

60
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:51,540
And so what I did with this rubric was
try to address that from the production

61
00:01:51,541 --> 00:01:53,010
side instead of the grading side.

62
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,460
But the best thing you can do is teach
people to write because there's no

63
00:01:56,461 --> 00:01:57,840
difference between that and thinking.

64
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:03,030
And one of the things that just blows me
away about universities is that no one

65
00:02:03,031 --> 00:02:05,490
ever tell students why they
should write something.

66
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:06,271
It's like,

67
00:02:06,271 --> 00:02:06,421
well,

68
00:02:06,421 --> 00:02:09,990
you have to do this assignment well
why are you writing while you need the

69
00:02:09,991 --> 00:02:10,380
grade?

70
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:10,651
It's like,

71
00:02:10,651 --> 00:02:11,484
no,

72
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:16,950
you need to learn to think because
thinking makes you act effectively in the

73
00:02:16,951 --> 00:02:17,340
world.

74
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:20,610
Thinking makes you win the battles you
undertake and those could be battles for

75
00:02:20,611 --> 00:02:21,390
good things.

76
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:23,190
If you can think and speak and right,

77
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:26,130
you are absolutely deadly.

78
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,020
Nothing can get in your way.

79
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,000
So that's why you learned to write.

80
00:02:30,001 --> 00:02:32,300
It's like why don't,

81
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:35,160
I can't believe that people
aren't just told that it's,

82
00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:35,481
it's,

83
00:02:35,481 --> 00:02:36,314
it's like

84
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:42,150
it's the most powerful weapon you could
possibly provide someone with and I mean

85
00:02:42,151 --> 00:02:45,690
I know lots of people who've been
staggeringly successful and watch them

86
00:02:45,691 --> 00:02:46,441
throughout my life.

87
00:02:46,441 --> 00:02:47,670
I mean those people,

88
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:49,230
you don't want to have
an argument with them.

89
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:53,370
They'll just slash you into pieces
and not in a malevolent way.

90
00:02:53,371 --> 00:02:56,520
It's like if you're going to make your
point in there and to make their point,

91
00:02:56,670 --> 00:03:00,730
you better have your points organized
because otherwise you are going to look

92
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:04,330
like and be an absolute idiot.

93
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:06,160
You are not going to get anywhere.

94
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:10,510
And if you can formulate your arguments
coherently and make a presentation,

95
00:03:10,511 --> 00:03:11,770
if you can speak to people,

96
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:13,750
if you can lay out a proposal,

97
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:14,441
God,

98
00:03:14,441 --> 00:03:15,550
people give you money,

99
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:16,930
they give you opportunities,

100
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:18,820
you have influence.

101
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:21,370
That's what you were at university for.

102
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:25,570
And so that's what you do is you urinate
Irin English right here and yeah,

103
00:03:25,571 --> 00:03:26,730
new languages anyways.

104
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:27,161
It's like,

105
00:03:27,161 --> 00:03:27,994
yeah,

106
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:28,390
teach,

107
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:33,220
teach people to be articulate because
that's the most dangerous thing you can

108
00:03:33,221 --> 00:03:34,120
possibly be.

109
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:35,351
So,

110
00:03:35,351 --> 00:03:36,370
and that's motivating.

111
00:03:36,371 --> 00:03:37,270
If people know that,

112
00:03:37,271 --> 00:03:37,600
it's like,

113
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,310
well why are you learning to write?

114
00:03:39,311 --> 00:03:40,120
Because your,

115
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,020
here's your sword,

116
00:03:41,021 --> 00:03:42,820
here's your m 16 right?

117
00:03:42,821 --> 00:03:44,410
Here's your bulletproof vest.

118
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,600
I like you're learning how to use them,

119
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:49,143
but

120
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:52,613
it's just,

121
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:58,700
it's an endless mystery to me
why that isn't made self evident.

122
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:01,770
So

123
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:04,500
that's the sort of thing that can
drive you mad trying to sort out.

124
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:06,300
It's like people are,

125
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:06,811
there's a,

126
00:04:06,811 --> 00:04:10,470
there's a conspiracy to bring people
into the education system to make them

127
00:04:10,471 --> 00:04:11,304
weaker.

128
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:12,953
So

129
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:15,940
I guess that keeps the competition down.

130
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,140
Maybe that's one way of thinking about it.

131
00:04:20,110 --> 00:04:21,520
If your students are stupid,

132
00:04:21,521 --> 00:04:22,660
they're not going to challenge you.

133
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:26,750
So other questions,

134
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:30,360
disagreements,

135
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:34,830
I mean it's a pretty harsh
indictment of the university system

136
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,350
when you were talking about marriage.

137
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:38,453
Um,

138
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:40,470
you get to play points

139
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,440
if you stay,

140
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:44,700
uh,

141
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:47,190
which is of course a really good point.

142
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:48,390
You,

143
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:51,180
you have more possibilities
to them towards a solution.

144
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:52,293
Yeah.

145
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,233
But that is also,

146
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:58,780
it's also assume that you
will always get a solution.

147
00:04:59,460 --> 00:04:59,791
Yes,

148
00:04:59,791 --> 00:05:00,624
true.

149
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:03,443
Yes,

150
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:04,380
yes,

151
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:04,870
yes.

152
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:05,140
Hello.

153
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:07,120
What a solution that
will keep the marriage

154
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:08,551
true?

155
00:05:08,551 --> 00:05:08,731
Well,

156
00:05:08,731 --> 00:05:08,971
you know,

157
00:05:08,971 --> 00:05:09,810
there used to be,

158
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,880
before the divorce laws
were really liberalized,

159
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:16,910
there wa there you could
sue for irreconcilable
differences and sometimes people

160
00:05:16,951 --> 00:05:18,720
do find themselves in that situation.

161
00:05:18,721 --> 00:05:23,190
It's like one person wants children and
the other person doesn't like that's a

162
00:05:23,191 --> 00:05:24,024
tough one.

163
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:25,650
It's a tough one to negotiate.

164
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:27,600
So I'm,

165
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:32,620
I'm certainly not saying that just
because you lock yourself into a like two

166
00:05:33,481 --> 00:05:34,410
cats in a barrel,

167
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:39,240
that that will make you
solve your problems because
problems are hard to solve

168
00:05:39,241 --> 00:05:40,620
and sometimes you can't solve them.

169
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:43,410
I was just pointing out what the cost of,

170
00:05:43,411 --> 00:05:44,970
of leaving the back door,

171
00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:47,220
what the cost of leaving
the back door open is.

172
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:49,340
And it's a big cost and a,

173
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:49,621
you know,

174
00:05:49,621 --> 00:05:53,700
one of the things I see too is that
people's identities fragment increasingly

175
00:05:53,701 --> 00:05:54,534
across time.

176
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:55,320
You know,

177
00:05:55,320 --> 00:06:00,320
one of the things that you have as you
age is something like the continuity of

178
00:06:00,981 --> 00:06:01,814
your life.

179
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:02,830
You know,

180
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:03,180
you,

181
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:04,700
you have someone that you're with,

182
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:06,620
you've tied your story
together with theirs,

183
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:08,140
you have children,

184
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,230
maybe they have children.

185
00:06:09,231 --> 00:06:12,680
It's like there's this continual pay off,

186
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:17,740
so to speak in quality that you
obtained from staying within that frame.

187
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:21,860
And you can jump out of that.

188
00:06:21,861 --> 00:06:24,290
And I suppose to some degree
that that provides freedom,

189
00:06:24,291 --> 00:06:26,240
but it isn't obvious to me
that it does that for sure.

190
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:27,173
People

191
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:30,230
once this relationship,

192
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:34,120
it's a my blood email.

193
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:35,991
No.

194
00:06:35,991 --> 00:06:36,350
But,

195
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:36,800
but,

196
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,820
but it's also the case that sequential
relationships are unlikely to be that.

197
00:06:41,970 --> 00:06:42,803
Okay.

198
00:06:42,850 --> 00:06:44,050
So look,

199
00:06:44,051 --> 00:06:44,330
I,

200
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:45,010
I'm not,

201
00:06:45,010 --> 00:06:45,671
I'm not making,

202
00:06:45,671 --> 00:06:48,730
I'm definitely not making a
utopian case for marriage.

203
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:55,070
I would like to hear the case where it
was from you because they make it really

204
00:06:55,071 --> 00:06:55,671
interesting.

205
00:06:55,671 --> 00:06:55,941
Right?

206
00:06:55,941 --> 00:06:57,170
It says talk point,

207
00:06:57,230 --> 00:06:58,400
but at the same time,

208
00:06:58,490 --> 00:07:02,170
I think there are some
relationships that are waking Oh,

209
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:02,870
quality.

210
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:03,170
Yeah.

211
00:07:03,170 --> 00:07:04,280
And if we,

212
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:06,500
if that's the case,

213
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:08,910
then insisting is on the,

214
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,150
uh,

215
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:11,983
cannot be good.

216
00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:12,341
Yeah.

217
00:07:12,341 --> 00:07:12,791
Well that's,

218
00:07:12,791 --> 00:07:14,770
that's definitely the
alternative argument.

219
00:07:14,771 --> 00:07:18,490
And of course there are strong
things to be said on both sides,

220
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:19,953
but

221
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:27,490
see there's some,

222
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:30,850
there's some additional problems with
divorce that people don't really grasp

223
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:32,493
when they're young.

224
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:35,980
Like the idea that you can be
divorced once you have children,

225
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:38,800
that's kind of a stupid
idea because you can't,

226
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,233
you can,

227
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,073
you can,

228
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:46,200
you can find a limited substitute
for your initial freedom.

229
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,310
But if you,

230
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:50,350
if you have kids and
you try to get divorced,

231
00:07:50,351 --> 00:07:53,140
the probability that that's going
to demolish your life is very,

232
00:07:53,141 --> 00:07:53,974
very high.

233
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:54,971
First of all,

234
00:07:54,971 --> 00:07:56,530
it's incredibly expensive.

235
00:07:57,010 --> 00:08:01,450
So one or both of you is going
to come out of that poor and

236
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:05,140
your market value has declined.

237
00:08:05,470 --> 00:08:07,510
Let's say you're the
woman who takes the kids.

238
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:10,300
Your market value has declined radically.

239
00:08:10,450 --> 00:08:11,680
You're going to be poorer.

240
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:13,293
The man,

241
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:18,250
he's just a screwed because he is now
an indentured servant and there's no

242
00:08:18,251 --> 00:08:19,084
escape from it.

243
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:21,220
So it's an,

244
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:25,270
it's not so bad if you can negotiate a
peaceful separation and some people can,

245
00:08:25,271 --> 00:08:27,820
but lots of times if you
have a terrible relationship,

246
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:30,280
it's not like negotiating
a peaceful separation.

247
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:31,180
It's all that easy.

248
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:33,370
But if you're at each other's throats,

249
00:08:33,850 --> 00:08:34,750
good luck to you.

250
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:38,410
I think it's roughly equivalent
to having nonfatal cancer.

251
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:40,540
It is not pleasant.

252
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:42,220
It's a 10 year process,

253
00:08:42,221 --> 00:08:43,240
15 year process.

254
00:08:43,241 --> 00:08:48,241
It'll cost you $250,000 and it'll tear
a big chunk out of your life and also it

255
00:08:48,731 --> 00:08:52,750
will really disrupt your relationship
with your kids and you know,

256
00:08:52,751 --> 00:08:55,030
you bring kids into a step parent family,

257
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:56,430
they do not do as well.

258
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:00,810
Step parents are not as good parents as
biological parents and the data on that

259
00:09:00,811 --> 00:09:01,380
is clear.

260
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:01,650
Now,

261
00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:05,670
obviously there are exceptions because
there are terrible biological parents and

262
00:09:05,671 --> 00:09:07,230
there are wonderful step parents.

263
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:08,790
But if you look in aggregate,

264
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:11,400
it's not that easy to care for children.

265
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:16,280
You need to everything you
can binding you to them.

266
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,380
And if there's someone else's children,

267
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:22,670
mostly they get in the way
of the person that you love.

268
00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:24,783
Right?

269
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:25,960
Well,

270
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:26,630
if I'm,

271
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:27,800
let's say you have a child,

272
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:29,173
I'll be right out.

273
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:31,610
Let's say you have a child
and I want to go out with you

274
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:35,150
every second you spend with
that child is a second.

275
00:09:35,151 --> 00:09:37,370
You don't spend it with me and,

276
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:38,750
and there's gonna be a price for that.

277
00:09:38,751 --> 00:09:40,340
I'm not going to be happy about that.

278
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:40,730
And,

279
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:41,870
and if I have a child,

280
00:09:41,930 --> 00:09:43,550
you're going to feel exactly the same way.

281
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:44,151
You might say,

282
00:09:44,151 --> 00:09:44,331
well,

283
00:09:44,331 --> 00:09:44,511
no,

284
00:09:44,511 --> 00:09:45,201
I love children.

285
00:09:45,201 --> 00:09:45,710
It's like,

286
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:45,981
yeah,

287
00:09:45,981 --> 00:09:46,520
yeah,

288
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:47,353
sure,

289
00:09:47,810 --> 00:09:48,643
sure you do.

290
00:09:49,010 --> 00:09:51,500
I doubted you might love your child.

291
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:52,620
And,

292
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:53,061
and you know,

293
00:09:53,061 --> 00:09:55,280
it's pretty specific the way
that people loved children.

294
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:56,803
So,

295
00:09:57,080 --> 00:10:01,310
and the rate of abuse for kids in step
parent families is way higher than it is

296
00:10:01,311 --> 00:10:02,390
in biological families.

297
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:03,830
There's not even any comparison.

298
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:06,830
So anyways.
