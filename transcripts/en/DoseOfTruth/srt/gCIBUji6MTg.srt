1
00:00:07,070 --> 00:00:07,410
Yeah.

2
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:09,240
Well one of the things I
really can't figure out,

3
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:10,850
maybe you could shed
some light on this too,

4
00:00:10,851 --> 00:00:11,940
is you know,

5
00:00:11,941 --> 00:00:16,941
of all the things that women's political
movements should be doing in the West

6
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:18,390
is demanding.

7
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:21,150
As far as I can tell that
the western countries,

8
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:23,070
let's say led by their male rulers,

9
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:27,720
stop treating the Saudis like are there
are allies and I cannot understand why

10
00:00:27,721 --> 00:00:32,721
there hasn't been concerted pressure put
on Western governments by women who are

11
00:00:33,271 --> 00:00:33,781
concerned,

12
00:00:33,781 --> 00:00:37,680
at least in principle with the equality
and freedom of women around the world to

13
00:00:37,681 --> 00:00:40,320
stop treating the Saudis
like they're our allies.

14
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:41,580
And so that and that,

15
00:00:41,581 --> 00:00:43,520
that's another thing that
perplexes me entirely.

16
00:00:43,521 --> 00:00:48,270
And though cynical part of me thinks
that the feminists who are more or less

17
00:00:48,271 --> 00:00:52,410
hell bent on the destruction of the
western Patriarchy adopt the attitude that

18
00:00:52,411 --> 00:00:54,390
the enemy of my enemy is my friend.

19
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:56,520
And so they're willing to put
up with what the Saudis to do.

20
00:00:56,521 --> 00:00:58,980
But I don't think that's
a sufficient explanation.

21
00:00:58,981 --> 00:00:59,814
So like,

22
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:01,620
I mean you can view our,

23
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:02,483
our culture,

24
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:04,200
so to speak a little bit from,

25
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:07,530
from the outside position because you
have moved in as an immigrant and that

26
00:01:07,531 --> 00:01:11,130
gives you a viewpoint that it's much
more difficult for someone within it to

27
00:01:11,131 --> 00:01:11,581
share.

28
00:01:11,581 --> 00:01:13,860
And so like what do you see as,

29
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:17,160
as driving the absence of pressure,

30
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:20,370
let's say from women on governments
in relationship to these?

31
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:22,830
I would say reprehensible dictatorships.

32
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:23,903
What's going on?

33
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:25,650
So the,

34
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:26,460
I mean she's cool.

35
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:30,980
I'll be occupied with Western
country after with the [inaudible].

36
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:33,200
What I see is that they have,

37
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:34,041
first of all,

38
00:01:34,041 --> 00:01:35,220
that's all that they're focused on.

39
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:37,070
They do not talk about,

40
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:38,110
discuss Craig,

41
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:43,120
she's the issue or a men of color
and the Patriarchy of man of color or

42
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:47,570
immigrants or the nations and countries.

43
00:01:47,571 --> 00:01:49,690
Men in nations and countries outside.

44
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:50,120
Right?

45
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:50,953
Oh,

46
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:56,350
the wench number feminists have also
written to the identity politics there for

47
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:04,200
to come to multiculturalism and
all these things are bad for women,

48
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:07,890
bad turn Western women and bad.

49
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,000
So if you believe multiculturalism
courses that before and that one person,

50
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:16,020
that's one project,

51
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:19,930
the wife had nothing to say
about the culture of Islam

52
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:24,700
since it's all sort of equal,

53
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:28,040
then they feel that they count,

54
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:30,053
um,

55
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:32,953
pressure

56
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:35,183
to address

57
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:42,930
list that black women and
Muslim women and women of color,

58
00:02:43,231 --> 00:02:45,090
if they wanted to get out of oppression,

59
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:47,010
then they should organize themselves.

60
00:02:47,011 --> 00:02:47,880
That's what they believe.

61
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:52,560
What I find ironic draw is that
sometimes when we do organize ourselves,

62
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:57,830
I am organized with all the extra Muslim
woman to talk about the misogyny that's

63
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:00,470
subjected to women in the name.

64
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:03,350
I get it from white linens,

65
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:04,663
white feminist,

66
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:05,503
atheist,

67
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:08,100
biggest puzzle ever.

68
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:12,370
The treatment that you've received
at the hand of Western feminists.

69
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:12,731
To me,

70
00:03:12,731 --> 00:03:13,060
that's,

71
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:18,060
that's something that's just absolutely
leaves me absolutely speechless because

72
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:19,470
not only me,

73
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:21,250
it's all of us who are hiring.

74
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:21,650
Uh,

75
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:22,020
again,

76
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:24,780
like I thought only two ex Muslims,

77
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:28,840
but there are black women who are
fighting for their rights and they all get

78
00:03:28,841 --> 00:03:29,740
shut down.
