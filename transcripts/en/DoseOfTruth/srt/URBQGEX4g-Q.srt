1
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:11,480
So that's the basic narrative I was here
and I'm trying to go there and so if

2
00:00:12,131 --> 00:00:15,940
you're asking your kindergarten kid what
they did today at school and teaching

3
00:00:15,941 --> 00:00:16,810
them to tell a story,

4
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:17,561
they might say,

5
00:00:17,561 --> 00:00:20,980
well I was at home and then
mom took me to kindergarten.

6
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:24,430
It's like not a very exciting story
but it's a story and then a little more

7
00:00:24,431 --> 00:00:25,630
exciting story might be

8
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:27,941
I was at home,

9
00:00:27,941 --> 00:00:31,780
my mom took me to school and on the way
there are big dog ran up to the fence

10
00:00:31,781 --> 00:00:36,781
and barked at me and the right question
that would follow that story is,

11
00:00:36,791 --> 00:00:37,151
okay,

12
00:00:37,151 --> 00:00:38,320
what did you do?

13
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:40,630
And that's a real story
because the kid says,

14
00:00:40,631 --> 00:00:40,991
well look,

15
00:00:40,991 --> 00:00:45,991
I was in this frame of reference and I
was aiming at goal a B actually I was

16
00:00:46,511 --> 00:00:51,490
aiming at point B and while I was aiming
at point B an acting out the processes

17
00:00:51,491 --> 00:00:52,324
that would lead me there,

18
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:54,670
something unexpected happened.

19
00:00:55,570 --> 00:00:56,530
That's a story.

20
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:57,341
And then you say,

21
00:00:57,341 --> 00:00:58,510
well what did you do?

22
00:00:58,720 --> 00:00:59,501
And the kid might say,

23
00:00:59,501 --> 00:00:59,711
well,

24
00:00:59,711 --> 00:00:59,951
you know,

25
00:00:59,951 --> 00:01:04,690
I was really scared and I hid behind mum
or so that would be one response and we

26
00:01:04,691 --> 00:01:07,240
still went to kindergarten and I was okay,

27
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:08,020
it's pretty good,

28
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:08,770
pretty good.

29
00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:09,850
Or The kid might say,

30
00:01:09,851 --> 00:01:12,910
well I wasn't scared at all because
I know that if you stand up to dogs,

31
00:01:12,911 --> 00:01:14,020
they usually leave you alone.

32
00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:16,060
And we went to kindergarten
and that was okay.

33
00:01:16,061 --> 00:01:16,631
And you know,

34
00:01:16,631 --> 00:01:21,010
the kid is trained to tell really they're
trying to tell a little hero story and

35
00:01:21,011 --> 00:01:24,100
if they're successful in the accounter
with the thing that's unknown,

36
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:27,730
then they triumph as a consequence of
their encounter with the unexpected.

37
00:01:27,731 --> 00:01:28,564
And poof,

38
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:30,150
you know that's successful at a pace.

39
00:01:30,151 --> 00:01:31,300
You Pat them on the head and you say,

40
00:01:31,301 --> 00:01:31,710
yeah,

41
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:32,543
that's really good.

42
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:35,200
They kind of smile and you
know you're teaching them,

43
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:40,620
you're teaching them how to comprehend
their existence in a narrative structure

44
00:01:41,051 --> 00:01:43,450
and you're also teaching them what
that narrative structure should be.

45
00:01:43,690 --> 00:01:47,980
So this is like a Meta narrative and the
Meta narrative says you were going from

46
00:01:47,981 --> 00:01:49,210
point a to point B.

47
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:51,160
That's the oval on that left.

48
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:53,800
And then something
completely bizarre happened.

49
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:58,780
Like I was betrayed and then I was in
this terrible place for quite a long

50
00:01:58,781 --> 00:01:59,830
period of time,

51
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:01,120
a chaotic place.

52
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:06,300
But I learned a bunch and I put myself
back together and I'm a wiser person as a

53
00:02:06,551 --> 00:02:08,110
consequence of the encounter,

54
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:09,813
right?

55
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:11,320
Everyone knows that story.

56
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:12,880
And that's paradise.

57
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:14,170
Paradise lost,

58
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:15,580
paradise regained.

59
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:18,280
It's a cultural meta-narrative and,

60
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:20,530
and it's a story that every,

61
00:02:20,531 --> 00:02:21,880
like it's a human story.

62
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:23,590
It's an apocalyptic story.

63
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:26,860
That's why everybody's always
all apocalyptic about everything,

64
00:02:26,861 --> 00:02:27,280
right?

65
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,660
Apocalypse of the week,

66
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:30,100
we're going to run out of oil,

67
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:31,420
we're going to run out of gas.

68
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:33,040
There's too much carbon dioxide.

69
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,840
The Chinese are going
to take over the world.

70
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,010
We're ruining the Co.

71
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,300
We're ruining the ecology,

72
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:38,950
the oceans running out of fish.

73
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:39,431
You know,

74
00:02:39,431 --> 00:02:40,870
the world is getting too hot.

75
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:44,110
It was getting too cold in
1970 when I was about your age.

76
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:46,330
It's like apocalypse of the week.

77
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,433
Why?

78
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:52,420
Because things fall apart and because
they can fall apart completely and they

79
00:02:52,421 --> 00:02:53,440
often do.

80
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:57,520
And so everyone's always on the alert
for like the next potential apocalypse.

81
00:02:57,521 --> 00:02:58,510
And it's no wonder,

82
00:02:58,690 --> 00:02:59,110
you know,

83
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:04,090
a permanent characteristic of life
that things can radically fall apart.

84
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:04,481
Now,

85
00:03:04,481 --> 00:03:07,960
luckily it's a permanent characteristic
of life that they can actually also

86
00:03:07,961 --> 00:03:09,610
radically come back together.

87
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:13,060
And it turns out that whether or
not they radically come together,

88
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:17,290
depends to some degree on how you
choose to act when they fall apart.
