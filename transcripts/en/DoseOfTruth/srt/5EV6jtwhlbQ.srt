1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:00,973
Hmm,

2
00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:11,120
here's another thing that made me a
really an advocate of psychoanalytic

3
00:00:11,121 --> 00:00:13,940
thinking.
It was the sort of thing that started to

4
00:00:13,941 --> 00:00:16,880
terrify me about what the human psyche
was actually like.

5
00:00:16,881 --> 00:00:20,820
I started to understand that not only
were we like an amalgam of,

6
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:23,900
of relatively autonomous
subpersonalities,

7
00:00:23,901 --> 00:00:27,050
each of which had the possibility of
gaining control,

8
00:00:27,770 --> 00:00:32,120
but that we're also victim,
you might say,

9
00:00:32,121 --> 00:00:37,121
or beneficiary of impulses that were
beyond our conscious formulation or,

10
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:41,630
or,
or understanding or capacity to resist.

11
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:44,060
So here's this,
here's a funny story.

12
00:00:44,061 --> 00:00:49,061
So I was talking to one of my patron
people online this week and he said he's

13
00:00:49,731 --> 00:00:51,770
a,
he was a committed atheist and that's

14
00:00:51,771 --> 00:00:52,430
fine,
you know,

15
00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:55,610
lots of atheists are very honest people
and they're atheists because they don't

16
00:00:55,611 --> 00:01:00,611
know how to reconcile what they know
with traditional claims,

17
00:01:01,041 --> 00:01:03,440
let's say.
And they're not willing to just mangled

18
00:01:03,441 --> 00:01:04,490
them together,
you know,

19
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:07,370
and there might be cynicism all that
associated with it as well.

20
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:10,640
But he said he was,
he said he was entranced by these

21
00:01:10,641 --> 00:01:11,860
biblical lectures,
you know,

22
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:13,760
which is pretty weird.
And he said,

23
00:01:13,761 --> 00:01:17,330
if someone would have told them a year
ago that he was going to be obsessed

24
00:01:17,331 --> 00:01:20,000
with the sequence of Biblical lectures,
he would have told them that they were

25
00:01:20,001 --> 00:01:22,940
mad.
And so we had a bit of a discussion

26
00:01:22,941 --> 00:01:24,890
about that.
And because this is an interesting

27
00:01:24,891 --> 00:01:25,724
thing,
you know,

28
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:27,290
and he,
he mentioned this,

29
00:01:27,291 --> 00:01:30,740
he said it was something like,
you don't choose your interests.

30
00:01:30,741 --> 00:01:33,950
They choose you.
And that's really worth thinking about

31
00:01:33,951 --> 00:01:34,431
too,
man,

32
00:01:34,431 --> 00:01:37,730
because you know it's really hard to get
interested in something you're not

33
00:01:37,731 --> 00:01:39,680
interested in.
Even if you know there's a good reason

34
00:01:39,681 --> 00:01:41,630
for it,
you know you're studying for an exam,

35
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:45,770
you find the material boring.
You know anything will be more

36
00:01:45,771 --> 00:01:47,540
interesting than,
than this studying.

37
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:49,670
Even though you know that that's what
you need to do.

38
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:53,420
You can't voluntarily grab yourself by
the scruff of the neck,

39
00:01:53,421 --> 00:01:55,220
let's say,
and shake yourself and say,

40
00:01:55,221 --> 00:01:58,280
sit down and concentrate.
Your mind will just go everywhere.

41
00:01:58,490 --> 00:02:00,200
But then if you're interested in
something,

42
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:02,900
and even if it's something you shouldn't
be interested in,

43
00:02:02,901 --> 00:02:06,160
because that happens all the time,
then it's like you're a laser focused

44
00:02:06,161 --> 00:02:08,000
man.
You can pay attention forever,

45
00:02:08,001 --> 00:02:10,430
you can work until you're exhausted.
You won't even notice it.

46
00:02:10,431 --> 00:02:12,230
Then you remember everything.
It's like,

47
00:02:12,231 --> 00:02:15,440
okay,
if you can't control your interest,

48
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:18,950
what does?
And Man,

49
00:02:18,951 --> 00:02:20,780
I tell you,
you can think about that for a very long

50
00:02:20,781 --> 00:02:23,060
time.
So you talked about the spirit

51
00:02:23,061 --> 00:02:24,590
Mercurius,
you know,

52
00:02:24,591 --> 00:02:27,010
mercury is the winged messenger of the
Gods and,

53
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:29,480
and here's how he conceptualized it.
Psychologically,

54
00:02:29,481 --> 00:02:34,370
he thought this is what the ancient
people who thought about mercury as the

55
00:02:34,371 --> 00:02:36,950
winged messenger of the gods were trying
to state psychologically,

56
00:02:36,951 --> 00:02:37,610
you know,
your,

57
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:39,200
your interest flits around.

58
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:42,800
It's like there's something that
captures it and that moves your interest

59
00:02:42,801 --> 00:02:43,940
from place to place.
You know,

60
00:02:43,941 --> 00:02:46,550
like if you walk into a bookstore,
you'll get interested in a particular

61
00:02:46,551 --> 00:02:49,820
book.
It's as if the book grips you because

62
00:02:49,821 --> 00:02:51,440
you don't know why you're interested in.
You might,

63
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:54,070
but often you don't know why you're
interested in that book and you know

64
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:57,110
your interest is flitting around.
And so that's mercury.

65
00:02:57,111 --> 00:03:00,100
The thing that makes your interests
flick flick around his mercury,

66
00:03:00,101 --> 00:03:04,630
the winged messenger of the gods and
mercury is the messenger of the gods.

67
00:03:04,631 --> 00:03:07,720
Because it's the things behind the
scenes psychologically that are

68
00:03:07,721 --> 00:03:11,290
manipulating your attention and for
young those were equivalent in some

69
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:14,750
sense to the last gods.
And so for young your,

70
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:19,810
your interest was being manipulated
behind the scenes by unseen forces that

71
00:03:19,901 --> 00:03:22,810
were associated with your character or
logical development across time.

72
00:03:22,811 --> 00:03:26,530
That was the manifestation of the self.
So the self is this,

73
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:28,780
the,
the potential you,

74
00:03:28,781 --> 00:03:31,540
let's say,
and the way it operates in the present

75
00:03:31,541 --> 00:03:34,180
is by gripping your interest in
directing it somewhere.

76
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:37,030
And that's part of the instinct of self
realization.

77
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:39,250
It's a mind boggling idea,
man.

78
00:03:39,251 --> 00:03:39,850
Really it's.
