1
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:05,340
Do you have any guidance around
taking notes from books and lectures?

2
00:00:05,341 --> 00:00:05,581
Yeah,

3
00:00:05,581 --> 00:00:05,791
yeah.

4
00:00:05,791 --> 00:00:06,624
No problem.

5
00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:10,560
Like don't be taking
notes during the lecture.

6
00:00:10,561 --> 00:00:13,830
Exactly because then you're
not listening to the lecture.

7
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:17,520
It's like listened to the lecture
and then take notes afterwards.

8
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:19,300
Now that doesn't work
for every discipline but.

9
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:23,850
But it certainly works for disciplines
like students in my lectures.

10
00:00:23,851 --> 00:00:24,511
I always tell them,

11
00:00:24,511 --> 00:00:27,300
don't take notes during the lecture,

12
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:28,950
listen to the damn lecture.

13
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:32,970
You can take notes afterwards because
what that does is force you to practice

14
00:00:32,971 --> 00:00:36,330
remembering and then
with regards to books,

15
00:00:36,331 --> 00:00:37,410
it's like read,

16
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:40,020
don't highlight,

17
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:41,820
don't underline like that.

18
00:00:41,821 --> 00:00:43,290
I think that that's just rubbish.

19
00:00:43,291 --> 00:00:44,520
I think it's pseudo work.

20
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:48,270
Read a couple of paragraphs or maybe
an essay or something like that.

21
00:00:48,271 --> 00:00:49,950
Depending on the density of the book.

22
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:51,060
Close the book,

23
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:51,953
think about it,

24
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:53,760
write down what you're thinking,

25
00:00:53,761 --> 00:00:55,410
write down what you remember but,

26
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:56,190
but,

27
00:00:56,190 --> 00:01:01,110
but in the context of what you're thinking
about because that instantiates it

28
00:01:01,111 --> 00:01:03,510
into your memory and
give and puts it at hand.

29
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:04,860
Like people ask me,

30
00:01:04,861 --> 00:01:05,521
for example,

31
00:01:05,521 --> 00:01:09,060
how it is that I can remember all the
things that I talk about extemporaneously

32
00:01:09,061 --> 00:01:13,620
when I'm lecturing and the reason for
that is because I've thought them through,

33
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:14,551
you know,

34
00:01:14,551 --> 00:01:15,600
I read them and I think,

35
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:15,841
oh,

36
00:01:15,841 --> 00:01:16,201
okay,

37
00:01:16,201 --> 00:01:17,910
well that's an interesting idea.

38
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:21,570
How does it relate to all
these other ideas that I know,

39
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:25,350
like what is it significance for this
idea and what's its significance for this

40
00:01:25,351 --> 00:01:28,020
idea and do I believe it and
how might I criticize it?

41
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:29,490
So it's Kinda like I'm,

42
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:34,140
I'm attaching little memory hooks to it
in in five different ways and then I've

43
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:34,651
got it.

44
00:01:34,651 --> 00:01:34,951
It's,

45
00:01:34,951 --> 00:01:39,600
it's part of me and that seems
to be part of recall rather than.

46
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:44,900
So rather than recognition and recall
is the Spontaneous Act of remembering

47
00:01:46,141 --> 00:01:48,750
something complex and
when you recall something,

48
00:01:48,751 --> 00:01:52,560
you're actually practicing remembering
it and that's what you need to do if you

49
00:01:52,561 --> 00:01:53,760
want that to be part of you.

50
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:59,210
So I would say separate out the
function of reading and note taking.

51
00:01:59,730 --> 00:02:00,630
So read,

52
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:01,673
think,

53
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:04,050
write or read.

54
00:02:04,051 --> 00:02:04,441
Write.

55
00:02:04,441 --> 00:02:05,300
Think though,

56
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,200
because the last two
things are quite similar,

57
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,610
but don't read the book and then read
a sentence and then write down that

58
00:02:11,611 --> 00:02:12,151
sentence.

59
00:02:12,151 --> 00:02:13,170
That's not helpful.

60
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:15,210
You could read the sentence,

61
00:02:15,211 --> 00:02:16,021
close the book,

62
00:02:16,021 --> 00:02:18,960
and then reformulate the sentence
so that now it's your sentence,

63
00:02:18,961 --> 00:02:19,201
man.

64
00:02:19,201 --> 00:02:20,100
Then you'll remember it.

65
00:02:20,101 --> 00:02:21,090
Then you'll understand it.

66
00:02:21,091 --> 00:02:22,110
That works really well.
