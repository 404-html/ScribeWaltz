1
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:07,660
Cause that's,

2
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:09,980
I agree exactly with what you just said.

3
00:00:11,210 --> 00:00:12,170
So what I,

4
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:17,230
the views that I've come to and study
moral psychology is that we is that humans

5
00:00:17,931 --> 00:00:20,060
are ultra social apes.

6
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:25,700
We evolved to live in these small groups
that are fighting with each other.

7
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:26,780
Uh,

8
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:29,960
we evolved to have these low
level animistic religions.

9
00:00:29,961 --> 00:00:31,490
That's our steady state.

10
00:00:31,491 --> 00:00:34,510
That's the way we were for at least a
hundred thousand years are much more,

11
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:36,770
probably closer to a million in some form.

12
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:37,670
Um,

13
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:38,870
so that's sort of our design.

14
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:40,640
That's what we were
designed for in a sense.

15
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:41,923
Um,

16
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:47,080
and in that sense were as individuals
really kind of stupid tribal creatures

17
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:49,010
designed to do post hoc reasoning.

18
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:50,090
Um,

19
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:54,290
but if you put us together in the
right way with the right checks,

20
00:00:54,291 --> 00:00:55,070
with the right,

21
00:00:55,070 --> 00:00:56,300
the right systems,

22
00:00:56,590 --> 00:00:57,423
um,

23
00:00:57,770 --> 00:01:01,700
the whole can be vastly smarter
than the components that go into it,

24
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:03,260
which is true of the brain,

25
00:01:03,261 --> 00:01:04,580
to the brain is composed of neurons.

26
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:06,680
Each neuron is really kind
of stupid little switch.

27
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:09,620
We can put them together in the right
way and you get something really

28
00:01:09,621 --> 00:01:10,340
brilliant.

29
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:11,180
And in the same way.

30
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:11,951
Um,

31
00:01:11,951 --> 00:01:13,160
I don't know the history here,

32
00:01:13,161 --> 00:01:15,560
but my understanding
is that science begins,

33
00:01:15,561 --> 00:01:17,630
or the culture of science,

34
00:01:17,631 --> 00:01:19,970
the scientific revolution
begins in Europe.

35
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:20,840
Uh,

36
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:22,610
in the 17th century.

37
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,170
As you begin getting,

38
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:26,750
you get the printing press so
people can share their ideas,

39
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:29,810
but you get communities of people who
are challenging each other's ideas.

40
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:34,220
And that's what makes it so brilliant
is that is that people have to do their

41
00:01:34,221 --> 00:01:35,000
best.

42
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,040
We're really bad at this
confirming our own ideas.

43
00:01:37,041 --> 00:01:39,020
It's very hard to make
it very hard to do that.

44
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:42,440
But you put your ideas out there and
then everyone else is motivated to

45
00:01:42,441 --> 00:01:43,274
challenge them.

46
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,650
And so if you put us
together in the right way,

47
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:46,760
the truth comes out.

48
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,210
And so adversarial systems
of law journalists know this.

49
00:01:50,211 --> 00:01:51,410
They have to listen to both sides.

50
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:52,610
Scientists know this.

51
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:54,140
Social scientists should know this.
