1
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:08,370
So they bow down to Joseph and properly.

2
00:00:08,371 --> 00:00:09,810
So you know he's,

3
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:12,060
he is even without his coat,

4
00:00:12,061 --> 00:00:14,850
he's still the person with
the coat of many colors.

5
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:16,830
And Joseph saw his
brothers and he knew them,

6
00:00:16,831 --> 00:00:20,490
but he made themselves strange and to
them it's a number of years have passed

7
00:00:20,491 --> 00:00:22,530
and he spoke roughly unto them
and he sat down with them,

8
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:23,700
where do you come from?

9
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:26,790
And they said from the
land of Canaan to buy food.

10
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:28,950
And Joseph knew whose brothers were,

11
00:00:28,951 --> 00:00:30,300
but they didn't know who he was.

12
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:37,670
And they came back to Jacob their father
and told him all that be fail them and

13
00:00:37,671 --> 00:00:38,300
said,

14
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:41,750
the man who is lord of the country spoke
roughly to us and took us for spies.

15
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:43,183
And we said to him,

16
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:43,940
we're,

17
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:45,470
we're true man.

18
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:47,390
Honest man were not spies.

19
00:00:47,391 --> 00:00:49,340
We be 12 brothers sons of our fathers,

20
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:50,690
one is not.

21
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:54,440
And the youngest is this day with
our father in the land of Canaan.

22
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:57,710
And the man said,

23
00:00:57,890 --> 00:00:59,870
here's how I'll know
that you're honest man.

24
00:00:59,871 --> 00:01:03,830
Leave one of the brothers here with me
and take some food for the famine of your

25
00:01:03,831 --> 00:01:05,000
households and be gone,

26
00:01:05,001 --> 00:01:07,160
and then bring your
youngest brother to me,

27
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:10,100
then I'll know that you're not spies,

28
00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:11,150
but that you're honest man,

29
00:01:11,151 --> 00:01:15,530
and I'll deliver the other brother and
you shale trade in the lounge so you

30
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:16,970
don't have to starve to death.

31
00:01:16,971 --> 00:01:19,400
And it came to pass as
they empty their sacks,

32
00:01:19,401 --> 00:01:22,640
that behold every man's bundle
of money was in his sock.

33
00:01:22,641 --> 00:01:25,370
And when both they and their
father saw the bundles of money,

34
00:01:25,371 --> 00:01:26,061
they were afraid.

35
00:01:26,061 --> 00:01:30,440
So they had bought food from Joseph and
he gave them the food and then he put

36
00:01:30,441 --> 00:01:32,480
all their money back and their socks,

37
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:35,360
which I could imagine would
worry them to some degree.

38
00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:37,070
And Jacob said,

39
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:38,181
me,

40
00:01:38,181 --> 00:01:39,890
you've already bereaved of my children.

41
00:01:39,891 --> 00:01:41,300
Joseph is not as Seminis.

42
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:41,841
Not now.

43
00:01:41,841 --> 00:01:43,880
You'll take Benjamin Benjamin away.

44
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:45,590
All these things are against me.

45
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,750
And Ruben spake unto his father,

46
00:01:47,751 --> 00:01:48,081
saying,

47
00:01:48,081 --> 00:01:49,130
slay my two sons.

48
00:01:49,131 --> 00:01:52,520
If I bring him not to the deliver him
into my hand and I will bring him to the

49
00:01:52,521 --> 00:01:53,354
again

50
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:55,830
and he and he said,

51
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:56,100
nope,

52
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:59,640
my son shall not go down with you for
his brother is dead and he's left alone.

53
00:01:59,641 --> 00:02:00,780
If mischief befall him,

54
00:02:00,781 --> 00:02:01,614
by the way,

55
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:03,520
in the which you shall go,

56
00:02:03,521 --> 00:02:06,730
then you shall bring down my gray
gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.

57
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:09,370
Now there's a hand,

58
00:02:09,371 --> 00:02:11,890
see what happens in the last
part of the Jacobs stores.

59
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:13,210
The Joseph story is,

60
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:17,140
and this is associated with the
idea of putting your house in,

61
00:02:17,141 --> 00:02:17,381
order,

62
00:02:17,381 --> 00:02:18,610
your individual house in order,

63
00:02:18,611 --> 00:02:20,350
and then putting your
family's house in order.

64
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:24,370
Let's say it's reversed a little bit in
this story because Joseph puts himself

65
00:02:24,371 --> 00:02:28,360
together and then he puts
the state of Egypt in order,

66
00:02:28,361 --> 00:02:31,900
which is really quite interesting because
Egypt is the canonical tyranny right

67
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:33,220
in the old testament.

68
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,410
And so the idea is very,

69
00:02:35,411 --> 00:02:39,430
very clear here that the person who
wears the coat of many colors can put the

70
00:02:39,431 --> 00:02:40,300
tyranny right?

71
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:42,550
And then the next extension is,

72
00:02:42,551 --> 00:02:44,410
well he has to put his family right now.

73
00:02:44,411 --> 00:02:44,711
You know,

74
00:02:44,711 --> 00:02:48,010
generally the progression would be put
yourself right then put your family right

75
00:02:48,011 --> 00:02:49,000
then put the state right,

76
00:02:49,001 --> 00:02:49,834
something like that.

77
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:50,813
It doesn't really,

78
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:52,240
if you could do it in a different order,

79
00:02:52,241 --> 00:02:53,500
that's probably okay too.

80
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:55,570
But so,

81
00:02:55,571 --> 00:02:57,760
so that's what happens at
the end of the story is that,

82
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,073
you know,

83
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:03,640
Joseph is doing pretty damn well
and so is the state that he serves.

84
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:05,320
But that isn't good enough for him.

85
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:10,650
He wants his family to be functional and
put together properly even though they

86
00:03:11,981 --> 00:03:13,150
did terrible things to him.

87
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:18,310
And that's very interesting because once
someone does terrible things to you,

88
00:03:18,311 --> 00:03:22,830
then the logical thing or a logical thing
to think is well go to hell in a hand

89
00:03:22,831 --> 00:03:23,321
basket.

90
00:03:23,321 --> 00:03:23,770
You know,

91
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:24,550
like you,

92
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:26,170
you deserve exactly what you get,

93
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:27,483
but

94
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:32,470
it's not a very productive attitude,

95
00:03:32,471 --> 00:03:35,770
especially if you're around
people that you have to be around.

96
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,090
You know?

97
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:42,090
So like if it's your family and you
go have a family dinner and one of you

98
00:03:42,281 --> 00:03:44,290
punches the other and then
the other punches you back.

99
00:03:44,291 --> 00:03:46,900
And then that's like the family
dinner for the next 30 years.

100
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:49,030
It doesn't seem to be very productive.

101
00:03:49,031 --> 00:03:52,420
Even if you're the person who happened
to get in the last blow because you're

102
00:03:52,421 --> 00:03:54,940
going to have to put up
with them at minimum.

103
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:58,380
It might be nice to just
let what you can go,

104
00:03:58,390 --> 00:04:01,960
go and work to make towards
making things better.

105
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:05,950
You have to get rid of the idea of revenge
and resentment and all those things

106
00:04:05,951 --> 00:04:06,761
that you carry along.

107
00:04:06,761 --> 00:04:07,594
But,

108
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:15,010
but it's probably better to think about
how your family could be if it was

109
00:04:15,011 --> 00:04:16,660
really functioning well.

110
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:19,060
And then just to aim unerringly of that.

111
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:19,691
I know.

112
00:04:19,691 --> 00:04:19,811
No,

113
00:04:19,811 --> 00:04:20,561
that's not easy.

114
00:04:20,561 --> 00:04:21,394
I mean,

115
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:22,860
people are very screw in.

116
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:28,090
There's no end to the depths
of pathology within families.

117
00:04:28,091 --> 00:04:31,360
But of course this story
states that very clearly,

118
00:04:31,361 --> 00:04:32,194
I mean,

119
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,640
they tried to kill him,

120
00:04:33,641 --> 00:04:35,290
they sold him into slavery.

121
00:04:35,291 --> 00:04:36,124
It's,

122
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,660
it's a pathological family,

123
00:04:37,661 --> 00:04:38,650
let's put it that way.

124
00:04:38,651 --> 00:04:39,100
And,

125
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:41,170
but Joseph's attitude is,

126
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:42,701
well,

127
00:04:42,701 --> 00:04:46,210
we got to set this right not
least because of his father,

128
00:04:46,211 --> 00:04:47,800
but it isn't only because of his father,

129
00:04:47,801 --> 00:04:48,610
as you see,

130
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:49,810
as the story unfolds.

131
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:52,720
And the famine was sore in
the land and it came to pass.

132
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:54,150
When they had eaten up the corn,

133
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,360
which they had brought out of Egypt,

134
00:04:55,361 --> 00:04:56,500
their father said unto them,

135
00:04:57,070 --> 00:04:58,660
go again and bias a little food.

136
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:00,790
And Judo spake unto him,

137
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:01,743
saying,

138
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:04,390
the man did solemnly protest unto us.

139
00:05:04,391 --> 00:05:04,980
You not see.

140
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:07,330
You will not see my face except
your brother be with you.

141
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,160
They cannot go back to
Egypt without Benjamin.

142
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:11,703
And they said,

143
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:15,400
the man asked his straightly of
our state and other kindred saying,

144
00:05:15,401 --> 00:05:16,540
is your father yet alive?

145
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,710
Have you another brother?

146
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:20,380
And we told them according
to the tenor of those words,

147
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:22,720
could we know that he would say,

148
00:05:22,721 --> 00:05:24,010
bring your brother down.

149
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:26,080
And Judas said unto Israel,

150
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:26,661
his father,

151
00:05:26,661 --> 00:05:30,220
send the lab with me and will arise
and go that we may live and not die.

152
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:32,260
Both we and vow and also our little ones,

153
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:34,060
I will be sure it he for him,

154
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:35,920
my hand shell,

155
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:37,510
they'll require him if I bring him,

156
00:05:37,511 --> 00:05:39,660
not under the inset them before the Len.

157
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,320
Let me bear the blame forever.

158
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:43,931
Well.

159
00:05:43,931 --> 00:05:48,931
So Judah who played a pretty dismal
role in the original selling Joseph into

160
00:05:49,961 --> 00:05:54,460
slavery seems to obviously have learned
something by this point since he's

161
00:05:54,461 --> 00:05:56,650
willing to put himself on the line,

162
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:57,171
you know,

163
00:05:57,171 --> 00:06:00,840
to take responsibility for the situation
and to put himself on the line and to

164
00:06:00,841 --> 00:06:02,540
stand in for Benjamin.

165
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:06,080
So he's making himself into a
sacrificial object of sorts.

166
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:07,243
And so

167
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:12,560
the game that Joseph's playing,

168
00:06:12,561 --> 00:06:14,300
because he sort of teasing his brothers,

169
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:15,860
but he's also testing them,

170
00:06:15,861 --> 00:06:17,330
the game that he's playing is twofold.

171
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:21,200
It's one is have you bloody well learned
anything or are you just as corrupt and

172
00:06:21,201 --> 00:06:22,640
useless as you were before?

173
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:23,750
That's game number one.

174
00:06:23,751 --> 00:06:27,590
Then game number two is maybe if I
poke and prod you and put you into a

175
00:06:27,591 --> 00:06:30,140
relatively difficult and
mysterious situation,

176
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:34,460
I can get you to clue the hell in and
the dog some responsibility and we can

177
00:06:34,461 --> 00:06:35,930
move this whole mess forward.

178
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:37,880
And so that seems to be happening.

179
00:06:37,881 --> 00:06:40,940
So Judah is taking responsibility.

180
00:06:40,941 --> 00:06:44,060
And Ruben did that as well and the men
took presence and they took double money

181
00:06:44,061 --> 00:06:47,810
in their hand and Benjamin and rose up
and went down to Egypt and stood before

182
00:06:47,811 --> 00:06:48,644
Joseph.

183
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:50,750
When Joseph saw Benjamin with them,

184
00:06:50,751 --> 00:06:52,250
he said to the ruler of his house,

185
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:57,260
bring these men home and slay and make
ready food for these men shall dine with

186
00:06:57,261 --> 00:06:57,830
me at noon.

187
00:06:57,830 --> 00:07:01,580
And the men mandate is Joseph Bade in
the man brought them in into Joseph's

188
00:07:01,581 --> 00:07:02,414
house.

189
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,310
And when Joseph came home,

190
00:07:04,311 --> 00:07:07,640
they brought him the presence which was
in their hand and bowed themselves again

191
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:09,463
to him,

192
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:10,333
to the earth.

193
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,650
And he asked them if
their welfare and said,

194
00:07:12,651 --> 00:07:13,281
is your father?

195
00:07:13,281 --> 00:07:13,611
Well,

196
00:07:13,611 --> 00:07:17,360
the old man of whom you speak is
whom he spake as he yet alive.

197
00:07:17,361 --> 00:07:19,400
And they answered thy servant,

198
00:07:19,401 --> 00:07:20,930
our father isn't good health,

199
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:21,800
he's yet alive.

200
00:07:21,801 --> 00:07:24,170
And they bowed down their
heads and made oh basins.

201
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:30,770
And he lifted up his eyes
and saw his brother Benjamin,

202
00:07:30,771 --> 00:07:31,551
his mother's son,

203
00:07:31,551 --> 00:07:32,720
and said,

204
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:35,570
is this your younger brother
of whom you speak unto me?

205
00:07:35,571 --> 00:07:36,440
And he said,

206
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:37,011
God,

207
00:07:37,011 --> 00:07:37,910
be gracious unto Thee.

208
00:07:37,911 --> 00:07:38,521
My son.

209
00:07:38,521 --> 00:07:41,690
And Joseph Made Haste for his bowels,

210
00:07:41,691 --> 00:07:43,190
did urine upon his brother,

211
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:44,840
and he sought where to weep.

212
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,780
And he entered into his
chamber and wept there.

213
00:07:47,781 --> 00:07:50,540
And he washed his face and went
out and reframed himself and said,

214
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:51,830
set on the bread.

215
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:53,960
And they sat before them.

216
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,780
Now he plays another trick on his brother.

217
00:07:55,781 --> 00:07:57,470
So he has them all sit at the table,

218
00:07:57,471 --> 00:07:59,450
but he lines them up according to age.

219
00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:01,430
And so he started up,

220
00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:03,770
what is he trying to do?

221
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:08,120
He started to freak them
out fundamentally and so at,

222
00:08:08,121 --> 00:08:11,300
and he manages that because they have
no idea how in the world they could

223
00:08:11,301 --> 00:08:11,841
possibly,

224
00:08:11,841 --> 00:08:14,630
he could possibly pull something like
that or if they think it's magic.

225
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:19,840
And the men marveled at one another and
he took and sent messages unto them from

226
00:08:19,881 --> 00:08:20,451
before him,

227
00:08:20,451 --> 00:08:23,660
but Benjamin's mess was five
times as much as any of theirs.

228
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:24,890
So what's he doing?

229
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:25,881
Well,

230
00:08:25,881 --> 00:08:27,500
he's testing his brothers again,

231
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:31,760
the fact that when he
was the child Joseph,

232
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:36,200
that he got more meant that his
brothers got terribly jealous and then

233
00:08:36,201 --> 00:08:36,801
murderous.

234
00:08:36,801 --> 00:08:37,400
Right?

235
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,310
And so now he's doing the
same thing with Benjamin.

236
00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:39,831
He's thinking,

237
00:08:39,831 --> 00:08:40,101
okay,

238
00:08:40,101 --> 00:08:44,120
well I'll give this
kid more than his share

239
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:50,680
and I'll watch how these reprobates behave
and see if they've learned anything.

240
00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:52,123
And so,

241
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:54,950
and he commanded the
steward of his house saying,

242
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:55,531
fill the men,

243
00:08:55,531 --> 00:08:59,610
suck with food as much as they can carry
and put every man's money in the sock

244
00:08:59,611 --> 00:09:00,444
as well.

245
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,380
And put my cup,

246
00:09:01,381 --> 00:09:05,040
the Silver Cup in the sax mouth of
the youngest and his core and money.

247
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:08,640
And the steward did according to
the word that Joseph had spoken,

248
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:09,930
as soon as the morning was light,

249
00:09:09,931 --> 00:09:13,350
the men were sent away along
with their transportation.

250
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:20,010
They cop is found in Benjamin sack while,

251
00:09:20,011 --> 00:09:22,800
so Benjamin is Kinda young and

252
00:09:26,010 --> 00:09:30,000
Joseph sends out people to find out
where the cup is gone and they find it in

253
00:09:30,001 --> 00:09:35,001
Benjamin's in Benjamin sack and
they're very upset about this.

254
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,073
Um,

255
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:38,700
they said that a harsh
punishment would be fall.

256
00:09:38,701 --> 00:09:40,710
Whoever had the cop in his sock,

257
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:44,700
they rent their clothes and laid at every
man his ass and returned to this city.

258
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,390
Judah and his brethren
came to Joseph's house for,

259
00:09:47,391 --> 00:09:49,080
he was the out there and they fell before.

260
00:09:49,081 --> 00:09:49,914
I'm on the ground,

261
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:52,350
very unhappy and apologetic,

262
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:53,640
and Joseph said unto them,

263
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:55,540
what feed is this that you have done?

264
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:56,423
Huh?

265
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,480
Don't you know that a man
like I can certainly divine.

266
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:01,980
I know what's going on.

267
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:03,241
And Judah said,

268
00:10:03,241 --> 00:10:04,080
what shall we say?

269
00:10:04,081 --> 00:10:05,040
What shall we speak?

270
00:10:05,041 --> 00:10:07,140
Or how could we possibly clear ourselves?

271
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:09,870
God found out the
iniquity of thy servants.

272
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:10,651
Behold,

273
00:10:10,651 --> 00:10:11,790
we are your servants,

274
00:10:11,791 --> 00:10:15,810
both we and also he with
whom the cup is found.

275
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:17,491
And he said,

276
00:10:17,491 --> 00:10:19,200
God forbid that I should do so,

277
00:10:19,201 --> 00:10:23,580
but the man in whose cup and
whose hand to cup is found,

278
00:10:23,581 --> 00:10:27,570
he shall be my servant and has for you
get you up in peace to your father.

279
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,070
It's the discovery of the cup.

280
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:39,271
Judah says,

281
00:10:39,271 --> 00:10:39,451
no.

282
00:10:39,451 --> 00:10:39,871
Therefore,

283
00:10:39,871 --> 00:10:41,340
when I come to the servant,

284
00:10:41,341 --> 00:10:45,360
I father my father and the loud be not
with us and seeing that his life is bound

285
00:10:45,361 --> 00:10:46,410
up in the lads life.

286
00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:49,650
It's you'll come to pass when he
sees that the loud is not with us,

287
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:54,360
that he will die and the servants
shall bring down the gray hairs of thy

288
00:10:54,361 --> 00:10:54,751
servant,

289
00:10:54,751 --> 00:10:56,370
our father with sorrow to the grave.

290
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:00,450
For Thy Servant became security
for the Latin to my father saying,

291
00:11:00,451 --> 00:11:02,070
if I bring him not unto Thee,

292
00:11:02,071 --> 00:11:04,590
then I shall bear the
blame to my father forever.

293
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,300
Now therefore I pray thee.

294
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:11,480
Let me stay instead of the loud and let
the loud go with his brothers for how

295
00:11:12,541 --> 00:11:15,960
shall I go up to my brother
and the loud be not with me.

296
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:17,700
Let's pair adventure.

297
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:20,040
I shall see the evil that
will come on my father.

298
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:20,851
Okay,

299
00:11:20,851 --> 00:11:21,780
so what's happened?

300
00:11:21,781 --> 00:11:21,961
Well,

301
00:11:21,961 --> 00:11:22,890
they learned their lesson.

302
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:28,850
So now Judah again is willing to stand
in the place of Benjamin and become a

303
00:11:29,701 --> 00:11:30,720
slave himself.

304
00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:36,170
And so now Joseph has determined that
his brothers have developed their

305
00:11:37,561 --> 00:11:41,760
character to the point where
reconciliation might be possible.

306
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:42,721
You know,

307
00:11:42,721 --> 00:11:46,050
it says you should forgive and forget,

308
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,240
but the conditions for that are quite,

309
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:51,960
are quite specific.

310
00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:52,471
You know,

311
00:11:52,471 --> 00:11:53,020
if you're,

312
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:57,130
if you have a dispute with someone and
they've wronged you in some sense and

313
00:11:57,131 --> 00:11:58,180
they apologize,

314
00:11:58,420 --> 00:11:59,230
the question is,

315
00:11:59,230 --> 00:11:59,381
well,

316
00:11:59,381 --> 00:12:00,760
what's the apology?

317
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:01,180
Well,

318
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:03,100
it's a layout of a rationale.

319
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:04,353
It's something like,

320
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:05,710
as far as I can tell,

321
00:12:05,711 --> 00:12:08,290
here's the reasons I
did this horrible thing.

322
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:12,760
And here's what I've learned from it and
here's what I'm going to do to try not

323
00:12:12,761 --> 00:12:13,660
to do it again.

324
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:16,060
And would you give me another crack at it?

325
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:18,490
That's the proper repentance,

326
00:12:18,491 --> 00:12:18,790
right?

327
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:21,370
And then you forgive
because you're an idiot too,

328
00:12:21,371 --> 00:12:24,700
and you'll probably do something stupid
and maybe you'd like the same kind of

329
00:12:24,701 --> 00:12:25,720
break at some point.

330
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:26,580
And,

331
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:27,251
and besides,

332
00:12:27,251 --> 00:12:31,240
if we all held each other completely
to account at all possible times for

333
00:12:31,241 --> 00:12:31,811
everything,

334
00:12:31,811 --> 00:12:35,170
then it just be hopeless because
there'd be no room for error.

335
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:38,470
So if forgiveness,

336
00:12:38,471 --> 00:12:41,110
which Joseph has showing
his wise forgiveness,

337
00:12:41,111 --> 00:12:45,040
he's not going to put himself out on the
line for people who haven't learned so

338
00:12:45,041 --> 00:12:48,340
that the same stupid thing can happen
again so that they can continue to spread

339
00:12:48,341 --> 00:12:49,510
misery wherever they go.

340
00:12:49,511 --> 00:12:51,850
He's going to find out if
they've clued in a little bit.

341
00:12:52,210 --> 00:12:53,050
And then if so,

342
00:12:53,051 --> 00:12:55,870
then they can move on with
putting the family together.

343
00:12:57,130 --> 00:12:58,240
And so that breaks them up.

344
00:12:58,241 --> 00:12:59,640
He says Joseph could not refrain,

345
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:03,520
refrain himself before all of them
that stood by him and he cried.

346
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:05,710
And then he said,

347
00:13:06,310 --> 00:13:07,810
get every mountain away from me.

348
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:13,990
So all of the people except for Joseph's
brother left and there stood no man

349
00:13:13,991 --> 00:13:16,390
with him while Joseph Made
himself known unto his brothers.

350
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:18,910
And Joseph said,

351
00:13:18,911 --> 00:13:21,610
I'm Joseph is my father is still alive.

352
00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:25,780
And his brothers could not answer for
they were troubled at his presence.

353
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:28,053
Yeah.

354
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:33,910
Understatement of the decade there.

355
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,820
And Joseph said unto his brothers,

356
00:13:36,821 --> 00:13:37,690
come near to me.

357
00:13:37,691 --> 00:13:38,261
I pray you.

358
00:13:38,261 --> 00:13:39,400
And they came near and he said,

359
00:13:39,401 --> 00:13:40,151
I am Joseph,

360
00:13:40,151 --> 00:13:40,541
your brother,

361
00:13:40,541 --> 00:13:41,650
who you sold into Egypt,

362
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:46,690
but don't be grieved or angry with
yourselves that you sold me hither for God

363
00:13:46,691 --> 00:13:48,700
did send me before you to preserve life.

364
00:13:50,650 --> 00:13:52,270
So now it was not you that sent me here,

365
00:13:52,271 --> 00:13:53,104
but God,

366
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:56,590
and he's made me a father to Pharaoh
and Lord of all his house in a ruler

367
00:13:56,591 --> 00:13:58,060
throughout all the land of Egypt.

368
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:01,180
Hurry and go to my father and sand to him,

369
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:03,760
thus say that I son Joseph,

370
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:06,220
God has made me Lord of all Ge Egypt.

371
00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:08,530
Come down onto me and Terry naught

372
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:14,320
and now it shall dwell in the land of
Gosh and and now shall be near unto me,

373
00:14:14,321 --> 00:14:17,260
Thou and thy children and their children's
children and they flocks and herds

374
00:14:17,261 --> 00:14:17,711
and all that.

375
00:14:17,711 --> 00:14:22,711
Thou hast and I there I will nourish you
for yet there are five years of famine,

376
00:14:23,310 --> 00:14:24,880
less thou and I household and all that.

377
00:14:24,881 --> 00:14:26,260
Thou has come to poverty,

378
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:29,570
so that's the other thing
that another bit of a hint,

379
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:32,560
it's a bread hint here.

380
00:14:36,130 --> 00:14:36,963
Who's the,

381
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:39,610
what's the most reliable source of bread?

382
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:40,310
Well,

383
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:41,320
isn't bread itself,

384
00:14:41,321 --> 00:14:45,370
it's whatever it is that gives rise to
bread and that's what Joseph is in this

385
00:14:45,371 --> 00:14:46,000
story.

386
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,330
He's the force that gives
ride rise to nourishment.

387
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:53,720
That's an Joseph is often
considered a type of Christ,

388
00:14:53,721 --> 00:14:56,150
which means like a
precursor in some sense.

389
00:14:56,151 --> 00:14:56,381
That's,

390
00:14:56,381 --> 00:14:59,330
that's one way of thinking about it and
you can see that echoed right there.

391
00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:00,350
It's like,

392
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:01,183
well,

393
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:04,070
what do you store up for famine?

394
00:15:04,071 --> 00:15:05,330
You store up character.

395
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:08,000
That's the best way through.

396
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:09,681
Now,

397
00:15:09,681 --> 00:15:11,780
that doesn't mean you
don't also store up bread.

398
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:17,690
And they went out of Egypt and came into
the land of Canaan unto Jacob and told

399
00:15:17,691 --> 00:15:21,590
him Joseph is still alive and he's
governor and Jacob's heart fainted for he

400
00:15:21,591 --> 00:15:22,424
didn't believe them.

401
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:24,350
And they told them all
the words of Joseph,

402
00:15:24,351 --> 00:15:25,250
which he said to them.

403
00:15:25,251 --> 00:15:26,600
And when he saw all the wagons,

404
00:15:26,601 --> 00:15:28,130
which Joseph had sent to carry him,

405
00:15:28,131 --> 00:15:29,090
the spirit of Jacob,

406
00:15:29,091 --> 00:15:31,460
their father revived and Israel said,

407
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:32,593
it is enough,

408
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,051
Joseph,

409
00:15:33,051 --> 00:15:34,070
my son is he had a life.

410
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:35,900
I will go and see him before I die.

411
00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:39,230
And Israel took his journey with all
that he had and came to Beersheba and

412
00:15:39,231 --> 00:15:41,600
offered sacrifices unto
the god of his father,

413
00:15:41,601 --> 00:15:42,434
Isaac.

414
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:45,410
And God spake unto Israel in the
visions of the night and said,

415
00:15:45,411 --> 00:15:46,244
Jacob.

416
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:47,151
And he said,

417
00:15:47,151 --> 00:15:48,260
here am I.

418
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:48,471
He said,

419
00:15:48,471 --> 00:15:49,190
I am God,

420
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:50,300
the God of my father.

421
00:15:50,330 --> 00:15:55,040
Don't fear to go to each down into
Egypt for I will make you a great nation

422
00:15:55,041 --> 00:15:55,280
there.

423
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:58,640
And so that's how the
Israelites end up in Egypt.

424
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:02,840
I will go down with the and to Egypt and
I will also surely bring the up again

425
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:05,410
and Jacob shall put
his hand upon thy eyes,

426
00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:06,190
denies eyes.

427
00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:09,500
And Jacob Rose up from Beer Sheba and
the sons of Israel carried Jacob their

428
00:16:09,501 --> 00:16:11,930
father and the little ones
and their wives in the wagons,

429
00:16:11,931 --> 00:16:13,390
which pharaoh had sent to carry him.

430
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:18,320
So the families now all United in the
proper state of being that Joseph has

431
00:16:18,321 --> 00:16:21,200
arranged and they took their
cattle and their goods.

432
00:16:22,070 --> 00:16:24,710
It's so interesting too because
of course Joseph isn't even,

433
00:16:24,711 --> 00:16:28,880
he's a foreigner as well as being
a former slave and prisoner,

434
00:16:28,881 --> 00:16:29,714
foreigner,

435
00:16:30,110 --> 00:16:31,040
slave and prisoner.

436
00:16:31,041 --> 00:16:35,300
And yet he ends up ruling Egypt sheer
sheerly because of the force of his

437
00:16:35,301 --> 00:16:36,500
character and competence.

438
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:38,990
And that's really
something to think about.

439
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:44,210
And they took their cattle because that
story there is that there isn't anything

440
00:16:44,211 --> 00:16:45,100
stronger than that.

441
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:48,110
Doesn't matter what the circumstances
are that there isn't a forest that's more

442
00:16:48,111 --> 00:16:49,830
powerful not,

443
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:54,740
and I don't think that that's naive.

444
00:16:54,950 --> 00:16:55,341
In fact,

445
00:16:55,341 --> 00:16:57,230
I think it's the exact opposite of naive.

446
00:16:59,000 --> 00:16:59,870
No matter where you are,

447
00:16:59,871 --> 00:17:01,280
you can generally make things better.

448
00:17:01,281 --> 00:17:02,330
If that's what you want to do,

449
00:17:02,331 --> 00:17:06,770
and unless you're in in a place
that's really hell itself,

450
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:11,030
not usually is something
that elevates you in,

451
00:17:11,031 --> 00:17:12,350
elevates the people around you,

452
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:17,450
and you can do that wherever
you are because there isn't
a place that's so small

453
00:17:17,451 --> 00:17:18,380
that you can't do that.

454
00:17:18,381 --> 00:17:19,760
That's the message of the prison.
