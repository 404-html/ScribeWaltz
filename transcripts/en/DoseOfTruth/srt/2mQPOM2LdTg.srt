1
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:08,810
Okay,
now you know what you see on the left

2
00:00:08,811 --> 00:00:10,370
there at the top on the.
Sorry,

3
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:15,460
on the right at the top you see a
picture of an old man kissing Joseph

4
00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:17,240
Stalin,
which is quite a weird thing to do.

5
00:00:17,241 --> 00:00:21,410
Given that Joseph Stalin was probably
responsible for the deaths of some

6
00:00:21,411 --> 00:00:23,600
number of people in excess of 10
million,

7
00:00:23,601 --> 00:00:27,110
perhaps an excessive 30 million people
argue about this all the time.

8
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:31,250
He certainly starved 6 million
Ukrainians to death in the 19 thirties,

9
00:00:31,251 --> 00:00:34,010
which is something that you know,
for some reason you don't hear much

10
00:00:34,011 --> 00:00:35,570
about your education,
but you know,

11
00:00:35,571 --> 00:00:39,170
6 million Ukrainians probably worth
noticing a little bit,

12
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:42,260
but it doesn't matter because this old
man,

13
00:00:42,261 --> 00:00:45,050
this was taken after the fall of the
Berlin Wall.

14
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:49,580
He's nostalgic for the times when
everything was certain you know,

15
00:00:49,581 --> 00:00:52,130
and the,
the Gold Statue of style and his

16
00:00:52,131 --> 00:00:55,250
representation in some sense of a day of
five leader.

17
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:59,330
And the old man is there is in a
position of worship and then captain

18
00:00:59,331 --> 00:01:01,400
hook there at the bottom on the right
hand side.

19
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:04,580
He is quite an interesting character
because he's basically a tyrant.

20
00:01:04,581 --> 00:01:08,480
And the Peter Pan Story is very
interesting because Peter Pan Pan Sorta

21
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:13,510
means everything and Peter Pan is the
sort of person who wants to retain the

22
00:01:14,901 --> 00:01:19,760
dynamic potential of childhood because
when you're a child you're not anything

23
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:23,810
but you could be anything.
So you're pretty much only potential.

24
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:26,720
And then you might say,
well why should you sacrifice that

25
00:01:26,721 --> 00:01:30,920
potential to become something actual?
Because in some sense it's actually a

26
00:01:30,921 --> 00:01:33,050
limiting process.
So for example,

27
00:01:33,051 --> 00:01:36,710
and I mean this in the most concrete
possible way,

28
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:41,570
you have more neural connections when
you're born than you do at any other

29
00:01:41,571 --> 00:01:44,930
time in your life.
And most of those die by the time you're

30
00:01:44,931 --> 00:01:47,450
too.
So you go through this tremendous

31
00:01:47,451 --> 00:01:50,750
pruning process from when you're born,
from when,

32
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:51,320
til two.

33
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:54,410
So it's like you're dying into your
childhood personality.

34
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:57,170
And then again,
the same thing happens at the end of

35
00:01:57,170 --> 00:02:02,170
adolescence between say 16 and 21,
which is also the peak time for risk for

36
00:02:02,631 --> 00:02:05,570
the emergence of schizophrenia.
And some people think that's the pruning

37
00:02:05,571 --> 00:02:07,490
process gone wrong.
But you know,

38
00:02:07,491 --> 00:02:12,491
as an adolescent you also shed childhood
potential to become the limited.

39
00:02:14,031 --> 00:02:17,630
But specialized and potentially useful
thing that you will become.

40
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:18,950
And so you might say,
well,

41
00:02:18,951 --> 00:02:21,590
is it worth it?
Is it worth shedding that potential?

42
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:24,440
And Peter Pan's answer to that is,
well no,

43
00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:29,060
he wants to remain in Neverland as a
magical boy forever and he's King of the

44
00:02:29,061 --> 00:02:31,100
lost boys,
which I would say is not a very.

45
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:32,690
That's not much of a dominance
hierarchy,

46
00:02:32,691 --> 00:02:34,350
right?
It's like you're,

47
00:02:34,351 --> 00:02:37,370
you're the king king of the King of the
losers,

48
00:02:37,371 --> 00:02:40,880
so to speak.
People who can't get their act together

49
00:02:40,881 --> 00:02:42,290
and mature now.

50
00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:44,930
And you notice in Peter Pan,
peter pan doesn't grow up.

51
00:02:44,931 --> 00:02:49,250
He doesn't establish a relationship with
Wendy who's actually real.

52
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:54,230
He has to settle for Tinkerbell who is a
ferry and they don't exist.

53
00:02:54,231 --> 00:02:58,040
And so she's really in some sense of
figure of his imagination because he

54
00:02:58,041 --> 00:03:00,690
won't mature.
He have an actual relationship with,

55
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:04,660
with a genuine person.
So he has to satisfy himself with while

56
00:03:04,661 --> 00:03:07,120
it's something like a pornographic
fantasy actually.

57
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,310
So seriously it is.
It is like that.

58
00:03:09,311 --> 00:03:10,030
I mean,
it's,

59
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:13,450
it's,
it's toned down a lot in the movie

60
00:03:13,451 --> 00:03:14,740
version obviously,
but still,

61
00:03:14,741 --> 00:03:16,660
that's what's underlying it.
Now you might say,

62
00:03:16,661 --> 00:03:18,610
well why doesn't Peter Pan want to grow
up?

63
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:22,270
And the answer is the only figure of
authority that's around for him.

64
00:03:22,271 --> 00:03:23,560
His P,
his captain hook,

65
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:26,410
and he doesn't like Captain Hook.
And that's because captain hook is a

66
00:03:26,411 --> 00:03:28,270
tyrant.
He's brutal,

67
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:31,100
you know,
and he's also a coward because he's,

68
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:34,390
he's lost a hand already to a crocodile
with a clock in its stomach.

69
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:36,990
That's chaos and time,
you know,

70
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:39,400
that's the dragon that lives underneath
everything.

71
00:03:39,401 --> 00:03:42,820
It's like the basset lists can Harry
Potter and that Damn Crocodile's already

72
00:03:42,821 --> 00:03:43,870
got it.
Piece of him,

73
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:47,140
which is exactly the case.
That crocodile has got a piece of me,

74
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:51,070
you know,
I'm older than 50 and so time is already

75
00:03:51,071 --> 00:03:53,020
got its grip on me.
And you know,

76
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:57,790
part of the problem of being adult is
that you also have to take the fact that

77
00:03:57,791 --> 00:04:01,810
your finite and limited into account.
And if you're terrified by that,

78
00:04:01,811 --> 00:04:04,330
which people tend to be,
then it can easily turn you into a

79
00:04:04,331 --> 00:04:07,720
tyrant because you're afraid of
everything or disgusted by everything

80
00:04:07,721 --> 00:04:10,000
and you have to ramp up the amount you
control it.

81
00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:13,720
And so Peter Pan looks at Captain Hook
and he thinks there's no damn way.

82
00:04:13,721 --> 00:04:16,810
That's what I want to end up as.
So he's got a bad role model,

83
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:20,440
you know.
So Captain Hook and Stalin and this sort

84
00:04:20,441 --> 00:04:24,280
of devouring monster are good
representations of the negative or

85
00:04:24,281 --> 00:04:28,090
tyrannical element of the great father.
So that's the tyrannical element of the

86
00:04:28,091 --> 00:04:29,020
dominance hierarchy.
