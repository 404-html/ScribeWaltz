1
00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:04,320
Crippled religions,
that's the right way to think about

2
00:00:04,321 --> 00:00:06,030
them.
They're like a religion that's missing

3
00:00:06,031 --> 00:00:08,490
an arm and a leg but can still haul bill
along and it,

4
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:11,460
it provides a certain amount of security
and group identity,

5
00:00:11,461 --> 00:00:14,250
but it's,
it's warped and twisted and demented and

6
00:00:14,251 --> 00:00:18,630
banter and it's a parasite on something
underlying that's rich and true.

7
00:00:18,631 --> 00:00:20,760
And that's how it looks to me anyways.
And,

8
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:25,230
and so.
So I think it's very important that we

9
00:00:25,231 --> 00:00:27,470
sort out this problem.
Um,

10
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:30,660
I think that,
I think that there isn't anything more

11
00:00:30,661 --> 00:00:32,490
important that needs to be done than
that.

12
00:00:32,491 --> 00:00:34,620
I've,
I've thought that for a long,

13
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:39,650
long time,
probably since the early eighties when I

14
00:00:39,661 --> 00:00:43,350
started looking at the site,
the role that belief systems played in

15
00:00:43,351 --> 00:00:46,680
regulating psychological and social
health,

16
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:48,370
um,
because they,

17
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:52,290
you can tell that they do that because
of how upset people get.

18
00:00:52,291 --> 00:00:54,270
If you challenge their belief systems,
it's like,

19
00:00:54,271 --> 00:00:55,410
why the hell do they care?

20
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:57,360
Exactly.
What difference does it make if,

21
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:02,190
if all of your ideological axioms are
100 percent correct?

22
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:04,800
Like people get unbelievably upset when
you,

23
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:07,530
when you poke them in the axioms.
So to speak,

24
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,980
and it isn't,
it is not by any stretch of the

25
00:01:10,981 --> 00:01:12,870
imagination,
obvious why,

26
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:14,670
you know,
but there's some,

27
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:17,850
it's like there's a fundamental truth
that they're standing on.

28
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:21,540
It's like they're on a raft in the
middle of the ocean and you're starting

29
00:01:21,541 --> 00:01:22,800
to pull up the logs,
you know,

30
00:01:22,801 --> 00:01:24,900
and they're afraid they're going to fall
in and drown.

31
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:28,170
It's like drowning.
What and what are the logs protecting

32
00:01:28,171 --> 00:01:31,140
themselves,
protecting them from and why are they so

33
00:01:31,141 --> 00:01:34,350
afraid to,
to move beyond the confines of the

34
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:37,770
ideological system.
And these are not obvious things.
