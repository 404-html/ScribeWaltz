1
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:08,820
How can a very,

2
00:00:08,821 --> 00:00:09,631
very interesting issue.

3
00:00:09,631 --> 00:00:11,030
So this try and pick a couple of,

4
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:12,113
but the fact

5
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:14,730
it's evident to me,

6
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:18,150
and I'm enormously encouraged by this
because I'm a passionate of Australia and

7
00:00:18,151 --> 00:00:22,230
I'd want this country to be the sort of
place that offers opportunities of the

8
00:00:22,231 --> 00:00:23,670
salt that I had when I was young.

9
00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:24,630
You know,

10
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:25,740
I've had my opportunities,

11
00:00:25,741 --> 00:00:27,360
but I look at my kids' generation,

12
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:32,870
what's going to be there for them if we
keep feeding the sort of scene grew in

13
00:00:34,231 --> 00:00:35,064
reality,

14
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:37,410
the people turning out in vast numbers.

15
00:00:37,411 --> 00:00:41,160
Every one of your talks in Australia's
been oversubscribed massively.

16
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:46,700
It tells you that kind of get those
more to this new way of being tall.

17
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:47,980
No.

18
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:48,340
Well,

19
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:51,100
it's one of the things that's so
interesting about dealing with archetypal

20
00:00:51,101 --> 00:00:55,720
themes know architectural themes are
archetypal because they actually speak of

21
00:00:55,721 --> 00:00:57,610
the structure of human experience.

22
00:00:57,970 --> 00:00:59,110
That's why they last.

23
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:03,460
And so it's human nature and
human experience has a pattern.

24
00:01:04,210 --> 00:01:07,990
You don't have the capacity
to do articulate that
pattern as an individual in

25
00:01:07,991 --> 00:01:09,490
part because your life is too short.

26
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:11,080
You just can't figure it out.

27
00:01:11,410 --> 00:01:12,270
But the,

28
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:16,630
the ancient representations
of those patterns are
everywhere around you and you,

29
00:01:16,631 --> 00:01:17,081
you know,

30
00:01:17,081 --> 00:01:18,070
some of them at the image,

31
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:20,590
you caught on to them automatically you,

32
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:20,960
you,

33
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:21,761
you fall into them.

34
00:01:21,761 --> 00:01:23,170
If you go to a movie for example,

35
00:01:23,171 --> 00:01:25,240
because movies always
express archetipal themes.

36
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:27,700
If you hear them articulate it,

37
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:28,450
you think,

38
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:29,320
I knew that,

39
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:30,071
I knew that.

40
00:01:30,071 --> 00:01:31,420
I just didn't know how to say it.

41
00:01:31,570 --> 00:01:31,841
That's,

42
00:01:31,841 --> 00:01:33,490
that's the platonic idea of,

43
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:34,091
of,

44
00:01:34,091 --> 00:01:34,720
uh,

45
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:35,080
of,

46
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:36,850
of learning as remembering your,

47
00:01:36,851 --> 00:01:38,350
your soul already knows,

48
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:40,150
but it doesn't have the words.

49
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:45,160
And so when people talk to me
about watching my lectures,

50
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:47,020
let's say they say,

51
00:01:47,021 --> 00:01:48,670
they basically say one of two things.

52
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:48,840
If,

53
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:49,240
if it,

54
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:50,830
if it's not just a simple thank you.

55
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:52,150
They say one of two things.

56
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:53,620
A third of them say,

57
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,120
quarter of them say,

58
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:57,160
when I listen to you talk,

59
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:00,010
it's as if you're telling me
things that I already know.

60
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:01,001
It's like,

61
00:02:01,001 --> 00:02:01,151
yeah,

62
00:02:01,151 --> 00:02:04,390
well that's exactly right because that's
what archetipal stories are there.

63
00:02:04,391 --> 00:02:06,130
The description of what you already know,

64
00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:08,290
but that can be articulated.

65
00:02:08,291 --> 00:02:13,000
And then who you are and
how you see yourself and the
way you described yourself

66
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:14,890
all become the same thing.

67
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:16,060
So that's wonderful.

68
00:02:16,061 --> 00:02:17,530
Then you're not at odds with yourself,

69
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:17,980
you know,

70
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:18,760
and then you have,

71
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:21,580
then you're a functioning unity and
that makes you much stronger and more

72
00:02:21,581 --> 00:02:23,110
indomitable than you would otherwise be.

73
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,030
And then the other thing that people say,

74
00:02:25,031 --> 00:02:26,680
and this is more like
three quarters of them,

75
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,450
is that they say,

76
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,310
I was in a very dark place.

77
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:31,091
I was addicted,

78
00:02:31,091 --> 00:02:31,570
I was,

79
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:32,800
I was drinking too much.

80
00:02:32,801 --> 00:02:33,700
I had a fragment,

81
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:36,850
did relationship with my fiance
and I wasn't getting married.

82
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:37,331
Uh,

83
00:02:37,331 --> 00:02:39,280
things weren't going
very well with my family.

84
00:02:39,281 --> 00:02:41,320
My relationship with
my father was damaged.

85
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:42,760
I didn't have any AME.

86
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:44,140
I was wasting my time.

87
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:45,460
Some variant of that,

88
00:02:45,461 --> 00:02:46,960
some combination of those.

89
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:48,190
And they say,

90
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:49,023
well,

91
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:51,430
I've been watching your lectures.

92
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,620
I've decided to establish a purpose.

93
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:57,370
I'm trying to tell the truth
and things are way better.

94
00:02:57,730 --> 00:02:58,300
And I've,

95
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:02,710
and so let's say I've done maybe eight
or nine large scale public talks in the

96
00:03:02,711 --> 00:03:03,431
last two months.

97
00:03:03,431 --> 00:03:05,590
So that's probably 20,000 people.

98
00:03:05,591 --> 00:03:07,210
And about half of them,

99
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:09,520
a third to half of the misstate
afterwards to talk to me.

100
00:03:09,521 --> 00:03:12,370
So that's about 7,000 people
who have said that to me.

101
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:14,680
And then people stop me on
the street all the time.

102
00:03:14,681 --> 00:03:16,180
And tell me exactly that story,

103
00:03:16,181 --> 00:03:17,380
which is just wonderful.

104
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:21,280
Like you can't imagine how good it is
to be able to go to places you've never

105
00:03:21,281 --> 00:03:22,090
been.

106
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:25,150
And to have people start people on
the streets spontaneously and say,

107
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:25,990
look,

108
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:27,940
my life is way better than it was.

109
00:03:27,941 --> 00:03:28,774
It's like,

110
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:29,890
it's so good.

111
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:30,910
And so,

112
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:31,780
and I've got like,

113
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:32,380
I don't know,

114
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:35,320
35,000 letters from
people since last August.

115
00:03:35,321 --> 00:03:36,041
It's more than that.

116
00:03:36,041 --> 00:03:37,060
I can't keep track of them.

117
00:03:37,061 --> 00:03:38,470
And it's exactly the same thing,

118
00:03:38,471 --> 00:03:39,304
like three quarters,

119
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:40,510
quarter of them say,

120
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:40,931
well,

121
00:03:40,931 --> 00:03:43,450
you've given me the words to say
what I already knew it was true.

122
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:44,710
And thank you for that.

123
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:46,150
I can see that in the audience.

124
00:03:46,151 --> 00:03:48,670
It's so interesting because
I can lay out a story.

125
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:51,220
People go like this and say
they're doing that all the time.

126
00:03:51,221 --> 00:03:52,630
It's like the lights are going on.

127
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:53,590
And that's a really,

128
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:54,440
while there's no,

129
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:57,520
almost nothing better than that to watch
lights go on when you're talking to

130
00:03:57,521 --> 00:03:57,851
people,

131
00:03:57,851 --> 00:04:00,610
it's like that's just
absolutely fantastic.

132
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:03,400
But to get this response from people,

133
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:04,293
my father,

134
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:05,920
I have my father's about 80,

135
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:07,990
80 is 83,

136
00:04:07,991 --> 00:04:10,930
I think 81 he's 81.

137
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,130
And uh,

138
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:13,170
I put it in charge of,

139
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:15,310
of going through my viewer email,

140
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:16,283
um,

141
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:17,860
which is an overwhelming job.

142
00:04:17,861 --> 00:04:19,040
But now he,

143
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:20,800
we've had discussions
about this constantly.

144
00:04:20,801 --> 00:04:24,760
He's overwhelmed by the fact that so many
people are writing and saying the same

145
00:04:24,761 --> 00:04:25,061
thing.

146
00:04:25,061 --> 00:04:25,421
It's like,

147
00:04:25,421 --> 00:04:26,254
well,

148
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:29,260
I have a purpose in my
life actually matters.

149
00:04:29,261 --> 00:04:32,860
I finally realized that and I'm putting
it into practice and I'm bearing up

150
00:04:32,861 --> 00:04:34,570
under the heaviest load I can imagine.

151
00:04:34,571 --> 00:04:36,130
And it's really helping.

152
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:37,143
It's like God,

153
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:40,270
and that's tens of
thousands of responses now.

154
00:04:40,271 --> 00:04:41,230
So it's,

155
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,400
it's,

156
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:46,360
you couldn't hope for
anything better than that.

157
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:47,920
There's zero harm in it,

158
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:48,161
right?

159
00:04:48,161 --> 00:04:49,840
It's just people putting
their lives together,

160
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:53,770
they're not mucking about with other
people and are trying to make broad scale

161
00:04:53,771 --> 00:04:56,380
social transformations about
which they have no idea.

162
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:01,000
They're trying to make their immediate
environment better and it's working.

163
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:02,050
It's like great,

164
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:03,593
great.

165
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:05,190
You say the zero harm in it.

166
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:08,790
I would say as a former legislator that
there's an enormous amount of good in a

167
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:09,581
country is only,

168
00:05:09,581 --> 00:05:11,100
there's some title of
the people would make it.

169
00:05:11,101 --> 00:05:11,860
Um,

170
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:14,110
to the extent that they
put together resilient,

171
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,220
I would only contribute,

172
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:18,460
don't have to ask others to help them.

173
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:20,590
The stronger the nation.

174
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:21,820
Yes.

175
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:23,110
And rapidly like,

176
00:05:23,111 --> 00:05:25,780
I mean I think I was
thinking the other day some,

177
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:27,610
a journalist asked me why the audience,

178
00:05:27,611 --> 00:05:30,280
why people are responding so
positively to what I'm saying,

179
00:05:30,281 --> 00:05:31,420
the young men for example.

180
00:05:31,421 --> 00:05:32,254
And I thought,

181
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:32,680
hmm,

182
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:32,870
why,

183
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:33,131
why?

184
00:05:33,131 --> 00:05:33,341
Yeah,

185
00:05:33,341 --> 00:05:34,180
that's a good question.

186
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:34,781
So it's,

187
00:05:34,781 --> 00:05:36,610
well I'm actually on their side.

188
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:41,890
I'm pretty happy that I'm really happy
that they're not wasting their lives.

189
00:05:41,891 --> 00:05:46,030
I'm really sad to see that people are
disenchanted and nihilistic and depressed

190
00:05:46,031 --> 00:05:47,570
and anxious and aimless and,

191
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:49,690
and perverse and vengeful and,

192
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:50,860
and all of those things.

193
00:05:50,861 --> 00:05:51,671
It's terrible.

194
00:05:51,671 --> 00:05:56,671
And then to see people question whether
that's necessary and then to start to

195
00:05:57,111 --> 00:05:57,861
rise out of it,

196
00:05:57,861 --> 00:05:58,520
it's like,

197
00:05:58,520 --> 00:05:59,211
it's so fun.

198
00:05:59,211 --> 00:06:02,150
Like last night I was at after my talk.

199
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:03,103
It's overwhelming.

200
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,313
Okay.

201
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:09,970
I don't usually think about these things,

202
00:06:09,971 --> 00:06:10,661
but I was,

203
00:06:10,661 --> 00:06:12,090
I was after my talk last night,

204
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:12,311
didn't.

205
00:06:12,311 --> 00:06:14,170
So all these people line up and you know,

206
00:06:14,171 --> 00:06:17,680
they have their fifteens 15 seconds
with me and they're kind of tentative.

207
00:06:17,681 --> 00:06:20,200
They're excited and attentive when they
come up to talk to me and then they

208
00:06:20,201 --> 00:06:20,470
have,

209
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:20,741
you know,

210
00:06:20,741 --> 00:06:22,510
15 seconds of time to tell me something.

211
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:26,740
I'm really listening to them and they're
hesitant about whether or not to share

212
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,480
the good news about their life.

213
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:28,721
You know?

214
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:30,370
And I think it's often because,

215
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:31,870
okay,

216
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:34,510
when people share good
news about their life,

217
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:38,260
people don't necessarily
respond positively.

218
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:39,101
You know,

219
00:06:39,101 --> 00:06:43,360
they don't get encouragement and
people need so little encouragement.

220
00:06:43,361 --> 00:06:44,920
It's just unbelievable.

221
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:46,980
And so they'll tell me
something good and nothing,

222
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:47,321
God,

223
00:06:47,321 --> 00:06:47,951
that's so good.

224
00:06:47,951 --> 00:06:48,221
You know,

225
00:06:48,221 --> 00:06:48,900
somebody says,

226
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:49,300
oh,

227
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:50,920
I'm getting along way
better with my father.

228
00:06:50,921 --> 00:06:53,020
I haven't seen him for 10
years and now we get along.

229
00:06:53,021 --> 00:06:54,970
It's like crate.

230
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:55,571
And the,

231
00:06:55,571 --> 00:06:55,990
the,

232
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:56,890
the power of that,

233
00:06:56,891 --> 00:07:01,270
you can't overstate the power of that
for individuals to get their life

234
00:07:01,271 --> 00:07:01,631
together.

235
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:04,600
They individuals an
unbelievably powerful force.

236
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:08,560
And every single person who gets their
act together a little bit has the

237
00:07:08,561 --> 00:07:10,510
capacity to spread that around them.

238
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:11,613
It's,

239
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:13,030
it's a chain reaction.

240
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:16,990
And so it's a lovely thing
to see and that's fantastic.
