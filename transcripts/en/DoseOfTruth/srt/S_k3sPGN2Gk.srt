1
00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:08,330
Steve has the first question,

2
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:12,320
how can we know the difference between
unhealthy repression and healthy self

3
00:00:12,321 --> 00:00:13,730
restraint of sexuality?

4
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:15,141
Well,

5
00:00:15,141 --> 00:00:15,974
I would say,

6
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:19,290
okay,

7
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:22,510
no part of what constitutes ethics,

8
00:00:22,511 --> 00:00:23,800
let's say first of all,

9
00:00:23,801 --> 00:00:24,430
let's start,

10
00:00:24,430 --> 00:00:26,140
let's think about ethics to begin with.

11
00:00:26,141 --> 00:00:30,730
So what's the point of
conducting your life ethically?

12
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:36,360
The answer to that isn't so that you
follow the proper rules precisely the,

13
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:41,650
the answer to that is so that you balance
your life so that it says productive

14
00:00:41,651 --> 00:00:43,510
and meaningful as it can possibly be.

15
00:00:43,511 --> 00:00:46,870
And that would be productive and
meaningful for you with any luck,

16
00:00:46,871 --> 00:00:50,740
but also for people around
you that would even be better.

17
00:00:50,741 --> 00:00:50,861
And,

18
00:00:50,861 --> 00:00:54,760
and for you now and next
week and into the future.

19
00:00:55,270 --> 00:01:00,270
So it's sort of a variation of the
philosopher Emmanuel counts moral dictum,

20
00:01:00,341 --> 00:01:04,120
which was act such that
your action becomes a moral,

21
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:05,320
a universal,

22
00:01:05,350 --> 00:01:06,101
something like that.

23
00:01:06,101 --> 00:01:06,950
Although I think that it's,

24
00:01:06,951 --> 00:01:10,780
it's better phrased across time
and across people like that.

25
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:12,663
Um,

26
00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:16,810
so when you're thinking about an ethic
that has to do with any fundamental

27
00:01:16,811 --> 00:01:18,250
motivation like sexuality,

28
00:01:18,251 --> 00:01:22,030
you have to think about it in the
context of the rest of your life.

29
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:23,313
Um,

30
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:24,370
the,

31
00:01:24,370 --> 00:01:25,780
the question is whether or not,

32
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:27,460
but what did I say?

33
00:01:27,490 --> 00:01:27,850
What,

34
00:01:27,850 --> 00:01:31,060
what did I read at one point that I
really liked with regards to sexuality?

35
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:32,573
Okay,

36
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:34,760
who's in control?

37
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:36,163
That's the issue.

38
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:41,740
Is it you or is it the sexuality that's
in control is have you integrated your

39
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:46,970
sexual life into the rest of your
life so that the whole thing makes a

40
00:01:46,971 --> 00:01:48,260
harmonious balance?

41
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:51,140
And Are you in charge or is it in charge,

42
00:01:51,141 --> 00:01:51,741
so to speak?

43
00:01:51,741 --> 00:01:55,550
Because if you're not in charge
with that harmonious balance,

44
00:01:55,551 --> 00:01:59,390
then things are going to waver wildly
out of control and you're going to find

45
00:01:59,391 --> 00:02:00,830
yourself in dreadful trouble.

46
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:06,790
That happens whenever any given driver
may really any given value predominates

47
00:02:07,521 --> 00:02:09,140
to the exclusion of all else.

48
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:10,303
Now,

49
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:15,800
it seems to me that sexuality is
best handled within the confines of a

50
00:02:15,801 --> 00:02:16,634
relationship.

51
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:18,143
Um,

52
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:21,410
that's the classic ethical
solution to the problem.

53
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:26,630
It's because sexuality brings with it
a tremendous amount of responsibility.

54
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:26,811
Now,

55
00:02:26,811 --> 00:02:28,070
people don't like to think that,

56
00:02:28,071 --> 00:02:31,070
especially people who I would
say are low in conscientiousness,

57
00:02:31,071 --> 00:02:32,810
let's say are high in impulsivity.

58
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:36,050
It's easy for people to believe in,

59
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:37,700
what would you call it?

60
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:38,810
Casual sex,

61
00:02:38,811 --> 00:02:42,110
which is not something that I think exists
because I don't think you can divorce

62
00:02:42,111 --> 00:02:47,060
sex from its sociological or
political or economic or psychological

63
00:02:47,061 --> 00:02:47,811
consequences.

64
00:02:47,811 --> 00:02:52,811
And I would say the endless scandals
that have plagued the United States in

65
00:02:53,541 --> 00:02:58,541
particular in the last year with regards
to sexual behavior are proof that

66
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:02,260
there's no such thing as casual sex.

67
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:07,000
I think the reason for that is that the
consequences of sex are too dramatic.

68
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,180
It's not just pregnancy and disease,

69
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:10,691
let's say,

70
00:03:10,691 --> 00:03:11,524
which are both,

71
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:12,843
um,

72
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:17,050
as dramatic as consequences
can be in life,

73
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,430
but also the fact that

74
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:23,380
there's no disentangling sexual
behavior from an emotional behavior.

75
00:03:23,381 --> 00:03:26,920
Or maybe you could say even worse if you
try to disentangle your sexual behavior

76
00:03:26,921 --> 00:03:28,150
from your emotional behavior,

77
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:31,840
then I think what happens is
that you end up cold and cynical.

78
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:32,950
I mean,

79
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:33,280
if you're,

80
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,190
let's say if you're a a cereal,

81
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:36,250
if you're us,

82
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:37,150
uh,

83
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:40,630
if you have a lot of one night
stands and a lot of casual partners,

84
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:42,850
then first of all,

85
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:45,610
there's not much discrimination
between one partner and the other.

86
00:03:45,611 --> 00:03:49,780
And so in some sense you're in a loop
and just repeating the same act over and

87
00:03:49,781 --> 00:03:50,021
over,

88
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:51,280
but you can't,

89
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,230
there's nothing deep about it.

90
00:03:53,231 --> 00:03:54,550
There's nothing that,

91
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:57,520
that enables you to establish a
relationship with another person.

92
00:03:57,521 --> 00:03:58,570
And I think that that's a,

93
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:03,790
I think that you corrupt your soul in
that way and that you hurt yourself across

94
00:04:03,791 --> 00:04:06,130
time and of course you're going
to hurt other people as well.

95
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:08,710
So I'm not a big admirer
of the casual sex idea.

96
00:04:08,711 --> 00:04:12,310
I think it's a demented
adolescents fantasy.

97
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:13,030
Uh,

98
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:16,090
fundamentally it just doesn't
work out in the real world.

99
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:17,770
Now,

100
00:04:17,770 --> 00:04:19,030
healthy self restraint.

101
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:19,480
Well,

102
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,680
with regards to sexuality,

103
00:04:20,681 --> 00:04:23,230
it's the same with everything
else is that there's,

104
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:28,060
there's the necessity to forego immediate
gratification for the purpose of

105
00:04:28,061 --> 00:04:30,160
medium to longterm thriving,

106
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:31,023
let's say.

107
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:36,360
So if your sexualities integrated in an
ethic that encompasses the rest of your

108
00:04:36,641 --> 00:04:36,911
life,

109
00:04:36,911 --> 00:04:38,560
and if it serves that ethic,

110
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:42,130
then I would say it's properly restrained.

111
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:44,200
If it's unhealthily repressed,

112
00:04:44,201 --> 00:04:49,201
well then you're angry and bitter and
resentful and cursing the opposite sex,

113
00:04:49,811 --> 00:04:50,980
or perhaps the same sex.

114
00:04:50,981 --> 00:04:55,981
If you happen to be gay for failing to
recognize your particular form of sexual,

115
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:56,890
uh,

116
00:04:56,890 --> 00:04:58,480
what would you call attractiveness?

117
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:02,050
I think resentment and anger are a good
indication that there's something wrong

118
00:05:02,051 --> 00:05:05,110
with the manner in which
your sexuality is restraint.

119
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:08,410
So I hope hopefully
that's a decent answer.
