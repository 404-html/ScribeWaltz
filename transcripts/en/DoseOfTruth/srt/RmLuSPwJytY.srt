1
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:10,970
And the seven years of plenty of snus
that was in the land of Egypt branded in

2
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:14,580
the seven years of dearth began to
come according as Joseph has said,

3
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:18,300
and a dearth was in all the lands.

4
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:19,793
Well,

5
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:21,480
that's an archetypal story,

6
00:00:21,481 --> 00:00:22,314
right?

7
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:25,020
The archetypal story to
the business cycle story.

8
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:27,810
It's a little harsher
when you're starving,

9
00:00:27,811 --> 00:00:28,381
obviously,

10
00:00:28,381 --> 00:00:29,370
but that's not the point.

11
00:00:29,371 --> 00:00:33,470
The point is is that sometimes things
are getting good and sometimes things are

12
00:00:33,471 --> 00:00:35,420
getting bad and that's,

13
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:39,840
you can be sure that that's the case
that's going to happen to you and so the

14
00:00:39,841 --> 00:00:44,841
wise person takes stock of the fact that
things are going to get bad is this is

15
00:00:45,451 --> 00:00:47,250
the same thing that happens with Noah.

16
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:52,320
It's like assume the flood because
it's going to happen and you think,

17
00:00:52,321 --> 00:00:52,471
well,

18
00:00:52,471 --> 00:00:54,000
it's a hell of a world that has floods.

19
00:00:54,001 --> 00:00:55,500
It's like not if you have a boat.

20
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:57,353
Right.

21
00:00:57,750 --> 00:00:58,620
It helps a lot.

22
00:00:58,621 --> 00:00:58,861
If he,

23
00:00:58,861 --> 00:01:00,240
if there's a flood and you have a boat,

24
00:01:00,241 --> 00:01:03,900
it's like you can float on the flood
and then it's not such a problem.

25
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:06,090
And so if you

26
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:12,590
refuse to look at the fact that things
are going to be going downhill badly and

27
00:01:13,921 --> 00:01:15,870
that you're going to be
in a pit at some point,

28
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:18,090
you and your family perhaps then

29
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:20,511
when it happens,

30
00:01:20,511 --> 00:01:22,700
it will be as bad as it possibly can be.

31
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:27,510
But if you're awake and
alert to that possibility,

32
00:01:27,511 --> 00:01:29,670
then you can mitigate it.

33
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:33,640
Okay.

34
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:34,900
And the dearth was in all the lands,

35
00:01:34,901 --> 00:01:36,070
but in the land of Egypt,

36
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:37,893
there was bread.

37
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:39,700
And when the land of Egypt was famished,

38
00:01:39,701 --> 00:01:41,140
the people cried to Pharaoh for bread.

39
00:01:41,141 --> 00:01:42,970
And Pharaoh said unto the Egyptians,

40
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,760
go to Joseph what he says to you to do.

41
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:46,630
You do that.

42
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:49,090
And the famine was all
over the face of the earth.

43
00:01:49,091 --> 00:01:53,200
And Joe Boo Josef opened up the store
houses and sold to the Egyptians and the

44
00:01:53,201 --> 00:01:57,820
famine waxed sore in the land of Egypt
and all the countries came into Egypt to

45
00:01:57,821 --> 00:02:02,821
buy to Joseph to buy corn because
the famine was sore in all the lands.

46
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:07,060
Now when Jacob saw that
there was corn in Egypt,

47
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:08,860
Jacob said unto his sons,

48
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:11,910
why are you standing around
looking at each other?

49
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:12,660
He said,

50
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:14,220
I've heard that there's corn in Egypt,

51
00:02:14,221 --> 00:02:19,221
get down there and I from a buy for
us so that we may live and not die.

52
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:22,450
It's like pretty
straightforward advice that,

53
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:26,250
and Joseph's 10 brothers went
down to buy corn in Egypt,

54
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:28,890
but Benjamin Joseph's brother,

55
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:30,090
that's the youngest one,

56
00:02:30,091 --> 00:02:30,301
right?

57
00:02:30,301 --> 00:02:31,131
The only one left.

58
00:02:31,131 --> 00:02:33,390
It's the one that was younger than Joseph,

59
00:02:33,391 --> 00:02:36,840
the only youngest one and
also Rachael's other suck.

60
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:37,950
But Jeff Benjamin,

61
00:02:37,951 --> 00:02:42,951
Joseph's brother Jacob didn't send
because he was worried that something bad

62
00:02:43,771 --> 00:02:44,461
would happen to them,

63
00:02:44,461 --> 00:02:48,810
which kind of indicates to me that maybe
Jacob was a bit suspicious about what

64
00:02:48,811 --> 00:02:53,811
had happened to Joseph the last time he
sent all the brothers on a adventure and

65
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,520
Joseph was the governor.

66
00:02:56,521 --> 00:02:57,570
Over all the land and,

67
00:02:58,310 --> 00:02:58,701
and he,

68
00:02:58,701 --> 00:03:02,320
it was sold to all the people of the
land in Joseph's brothers came and bowed

69
00:03:02,321 --> 00:03:04,930
down themselves before him
with their faces to the earth.

70
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:06,370
While there's the dream.

71
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:09,130
Now the thing is too,

72
00:03:09,131 --> 00:03:09,964
is that

73
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:14,950
one question you have in your life
is who should you bow down to?

74
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:16,121
And you might say,

75
00:03:16,121 --> 00:03:16,954
no one,

76
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:20,410
that's not exactly the right answer
because that means that you don't have an

77
00:03:20,411 --> 00:03:22,480
ideal because you bow down to your ideal.

78
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:23,890
That's what makes it an ideal.

79
00:03:23,891 --> 00:03:24,910
And if you don't have an ideal,

80
00:03:24,911 --> 00:03:26,230
then what the hell are you going to do?

81
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,090
So you have to bow down to something.

82
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,340
And so what happens here as well,

83
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:34,780
the brothers are bowing down to the
person who is so bloody resilient and

84
00:03:34,781 --> 00:03:38,260
competent that they can take themselves
out of a prison and become the ruler of

85
00:03:38,261 --> 00:03:38,800
the land.

86
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,360
That happened to Vaclav Havel,

87
00:03:40,361 --> 00:03:40,631
right?

88
00:03:40,631 --> 00:03:41,500
In Czechoslovakia.

89
00:03:41,501 --> 00:03:42,580
It also happened to

90
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:45,640
Mandela in South Africa.

91
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:47,590
These things actually happen.

92
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:49,180
It's really something.

93
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,760
So God only knows what
you might learn in prison.
