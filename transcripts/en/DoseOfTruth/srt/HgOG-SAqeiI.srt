1
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:09,830
Here's a good one self
that's in Saint Peter's.

2
00:00:09,831 --> 00:00:14,831
And I really liked this one because you
can see the echoes of Jacob's vision for

3
00:00:17,571 --> 00:00:19,280
the establishment of a territory there,

4
00:00:19,281 --> 00:00:19,491
right?

5
00:00:19,491 --> 00:00:23,000
You've got the obelisk in the middle
and then you've got the directions

6
00:00:23,001 --> 00:00:24,770
radiating from the center.

7
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:26,930
And of course Saint Peters,

8
00:00:26,931 --> 00:00:29,600
this is St Peter's Basilica in Rome,

9
00:00:29,601 --> 00:00:32,210
which is an absolutely unbelievable place.

10
00:00:32,211 --> 00:00:33,830
It's just jaw dropping.

11
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:39,230
And so there's the cathedral at the back
of it and then there's this circle of

12
00:00:39,231 --> 00:00:40,670
pillars that surrounds it.

13
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:42,500
You can just see them a little bit on the,

14
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:44,960
on the middle left there.

15
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:47,750
That goes all the way around
that entire enclosure.

16
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:49,033
And uh,

17
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:49,611
you know,

18
00:00:49,611 --> 00:00:51,680
very large number of
people can gather there.

19
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:53,113
And then,

20
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:57,140
so that pillar marks the center and
that'd be the center of Catholicism

21
00:00:57,141 --> 00:00:57,681
essentially.

22
00:00:57,681 --> 00:00:58,940
That's what that represents,

23
00:00:58,941 --> 00:00:59,171
right?

24
00:00:59,171 --> 00:00:59,600
The,

25
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,610
the symbolic center of Catholicism.

26
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:04,730
Although you could make the case
that the cathedral is the center,

27
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:05,541
it doesn't really matter.

28
00:01:05,541 --> 00:01:07,550
They're very close together and it's,

29
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:10,040
it's half a dozen of one
and six or the other.

30
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,300
And then here's another
representation of the same idea,

31
00:01:14,301 --> 00:01:14,571
right?

32
00:01:14,571 --> 00:01:17,810
Is that this is why people don't
like the flag to be burned,

33
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:18,471
you know,

34
00:01:18,471 --> 00:01:23,210
because conservative people see the flag
as the sacred thing that binds people

35
00:01:23,211 --> 00:01:24,044
together.

36
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:28,010
And so they're not happy when
that sacred thing is destroyed,

37
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:30,410
even if it's destroyed
in the name of protest.

38
00:01:30,411 --> 00:01:32,030
Whereas the people who burn flags think,

39
00:01:32,031 --> 00:01:32,211
well,

40
00:01:32,211 --> 00:01:37,211
there are times to dramatize the idea
that the center has been corrupt and you

41
00:01:37,551 --> 00:01:42,350
can demonstrate that by putting it to
the torch in who has a representation

42
00:01:42,351 --> 00:01:43,184
that,

43
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:44,210
that this,

44
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:49,210
that the corrupt center now has
to be burned and transformed.

45
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:51,650
And the thing is they're both right.

46
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:55,640
They're both right all the time because
the center is absolutely necessary and

47
00:01:55,641 --> 00:02:00,641
is sacred and is almost always also
corrupt and in need of reparation.

48
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,810
That's also an archetipal idea.

49
00:02:03,410 --> 00:02:03,711
And,

50
00:02:03,711 --> 00:02:05,600
and that's a useful thing
to know because you know,

51
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:08,900
it's easy for young people
in particular to think that,

52
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:09,831
well,

53
00:02:09,831 --> 00:02:13,820
the world's going to hell in a
handbasket and it's the fault of the last

54
00:02:13,821 --> 00:02:14,451
generation.

55
00:02:14,451 --> 00:02:16,040
They've left us this terrible mass.

56
00:02:16,041 --> 00:02:16,731
And you know,

57
00:02:16,731 --> 00:02:18,620
we've feeling pretty betrayed about that.

58
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:19,880
Now we have to clean it up.

59
00:02:19,881 --> 00:02:20,241
It's like,

60
00:02:20,241 --> 00:02:20,421
yeah,

61
00:02:20,421 --> 00:02:20,691
yeah.

62
00:02:20,691 --> 00:02:23,930
People have been thinking
that for like 35,000 years.

63
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:25,160
It's not new.

64
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:26,630
And the reason it's not new,

65
00:02:26,631 --> 00:02:27,980
it's cause it's always true.

66
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:32,390
You know what you're handed
is a sacred center with flaws.

67
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:33,111
Always.

68
00:02:33,111 --> 00:02:33,944
Always.

69
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:36,500
And it's partly because it's
the creation of the dead,

70
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:37,880
right in the dead.

71
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:38,571
Can't see,

72
00:02:38,571 --> 00:02:39,680
and they can't communicate.

73
00:02:39,681 --> 00:02:41,600
And so they're not in
touch with the present.

74
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:43,760
And so what they've bequeath to you,

75
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:46,610
apart from the fact that it
might actually be corrupt,

76
00:02:46,611 --> 00:02:47,930
which is a slightly different thing,

77
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,150
is it least blind in dead.

78
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:53,630
And so what the hell can you expect
from something that's blind and dead?

79
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:54,231
You know,

80
00:02:54,231 --> 00:02:56,870
you're lucky if it just doesn't
stomp you out of existence.
