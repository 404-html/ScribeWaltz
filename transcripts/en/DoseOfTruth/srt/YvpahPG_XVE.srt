00:00:07,850 --> 00:00:11,360
Any advice for a grieving parent
who lost a child unexpectedly?

2
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:13,251
Well,

3
00:00:13,251 --> 00:00:16,670
one I would say make sure that you turn
to the people that you have left that

4
00:00:16,671 --> 00:00:17,504
you love.

5
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:22,070
The second I would say is
don't be guilty about grieving.

6
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:23,540
You know,

7
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:25,340
and if you have friends,

8
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:26,690
you can tell them,

9
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:31,430
you could let them do something nice
for you because they would like that you

10
00:00:31,431 --> 00:00:33,920
can figure out something they
could do that would be nice,

11
00:00:33,921 --> 00:00:35,900
that you would appreciate
and let them do it.

12
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:36,951
Because you know,

13
00:00:36,951 --> 00:00:40,370
other people are going to grieve
at some point in the future too.

14
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:43,940
And maybe they'll be able to
ask you for help if you do that.

15
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:45,133
And then,

16
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:50,080
well,

17
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:50,341
I would,

18
00:00:50,341 --> 00:00:52,350
the next thing I would
say is give yourself time.

19
00:00:52,351 --> 00:00:52,920
You know,

20
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,030
it takes a year,

21
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:56,520
maybe longer to adapt,

22
00:00:56,550 --> 00:01:00,330
to adjust even reasonably
to such a catastrophic loss.

23
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:15,110
And then I would say try not to allow
that terrible wound to make you bitter

24
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,040
because then not only will you
have lost your child and grieve,

25
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:26,910
but you'll be bitter and then you'll be
resentful and then you'll be hateful.

26
00:01:26,911 --> 00:01:28,440
And that'll be like a terrible,

27
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:30,900
that'll add insult to injury,

28
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:33,900
so that's too bad.
