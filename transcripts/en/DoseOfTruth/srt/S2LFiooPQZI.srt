1
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:09,150
Interest rates are how much money costs.

2
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:12,350
Ali's money doesn't cost very much.

3
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:13,880
People are going to use more of it.

4
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:15,500
It's pretty straight forward.

5
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:16,783
So,

6
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:17,913
um,

7
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:24,430
it takes the breaks off things
because it's less expensive to risk.

8
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:25,611
I mean,

9
00:00:25,611 --> 00:00:27,500
that's why government to
manipulate the interest rates,

10
00:00:27,501 --> 00:00:27,771
right?

11
00:00:27,771 --> 00:00:27,951
When,

12
00:00:27,951 --> 00:00:29,330
when they want to stimulate the economy,

13
00:00:29,331 --> 00:00:32,180
they drive down the interest rates to
make money cheaper so that people spend

14
00:00:32,181 --> 00:00:33,014
more of it.

15
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:36,680
So it certainly contributed
to the housing boom,

16
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:39,770
although I don't think it contributed
nearly as much as crookedness did.

17
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:43,220
It was a combination
of radical innovation,

18
00:00:43,221 --> 00:00:44,360
which is always dangerous,

19
00:00:44,361 --> 00:00:48,170
although also necessary
and regulatory failure.
