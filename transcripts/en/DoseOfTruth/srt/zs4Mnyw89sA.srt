1
00:00:06,490 --> 00:00:07,323
Culture

2
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:12,090
of the cannon.

3
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:12,331
Okay.

4
00:00:12,331 --> 00:00:13,420
If people you know,

5
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:17,460
asserted that the Canon was
the product of bias and again,

6
00:00:17,461 --> 00:00:17,701
have a,

7
00:00:17,701 --> 00:00:18,001
you know,

8
00:00:18,001 --> 00:00:18,780
of a,

9
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:21,480
of a provincial elite as in and so on,

10
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:24,060
but in point of fact as a
student of history of the arts,

11
00:00:24,061 --> 00:00:24,271
okay.

12
00:00:24,271 --> 00:00:24,870
I can,

13
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:25,231
I can,

14
00:00:25,231 --> 00:00:25,490
sure,

15
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:25,771
sure.

16
00:00:25,771 --> 00:00:27,220
People the cannon.

17
00:00:27,221 --> 00:00:27,920
Okay.

18
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:32,520
The overwhelmingly so is is the result
of what artists have determined,

19
00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:32,761
okay.

20
00:00:32,761 --> 00:00:32,921
We,

21
00:00:32,921 --> 00:00:33,080
we,

22
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:36,090
we did we say a work is important.

23
00:00:36,091 --> 00:00:38,790
It's canonical because
artists following it.

24
00:00:38,791 --> 00:00:39,091
Okay.

25
00:00:39,091 --> 00:00:42,840
We're influenced by it and we have this
like beautiful cascading tradition of

26
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:43,740
influence.

27
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:44,360
All right.

28
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:44,940
So that,

29
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:47,520
that's another part of the Philistinism.

30
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:48,040
Okay.

31
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:49,920
I've current education to,

32
00:00:49,921 --> 00:00:50,131
to,

33
00:00:50,131 --> 00:00:50,310
you know,

34
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:55,310
to believe that there are these
external reasons for why a work last,

35
00:00:55,471 --> 00:00:56,304
why a work,

36
00:00:56,310 --> 00:00:56,591
you know,

37
00:00:56,591 --> 00:00:59,040
I'm a written 500 years ago
or a thousand years ago,

38
00:00:59,250 --> 00:00:59,830
has it

39
00:00:59,830 --> 00:01:04,810
global relevance as if it's some sort of
political conspiracy based on power as

40
00:01:04,811 --> 00:01:08,440
if anybody could even manage that no
matter how nefarious they weren't.

41
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:09,440
Right.

42
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:10,071
But also,

43
00:01:10,071 --> 00:01:10,850
you know,

44
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:11,280
we,

45
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:11,481
we,

46
00:01:11,481 --> 00:01:12,510
in the 60s you ain't had the,

47
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:13,191
had the idea.

48
00:01:13,191 --> 00:01:13,371
Okay.

49
00:01:13,371 --> 00:01:14,204
Then there was a,

50
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:14,690
uh,

51
00:01:14,690 --> 00:01:19,690
human human sensibility that transcendent
individual nations and so on.

52
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:21,090
All right.

53
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:21,591
And that,

54
00:01:21,591 --> 00:01:24,380
and that there was this like rubric,

55
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:27,010
cosmic consciousness and this son,

56
00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:29,390
this a sense of the universe as a whole.

57
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:34,370
And to see the human being in relationship
to great eternal principles of,

58
00:01:34,371 --> 00:01:34,520
you know,

59
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:35,840
of life and death,

60
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,190
mortality and so on.

61
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:37,911
Whereas,

62
00:01:37,911 --> 00:01:38,061
you know,

63
00:01:38,061 --> 00:01:39,520
Marxism is blind.

64
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:41,390
Marxism is very narrow.

65
00:01:41,391 --> 00:01:43,010
All it sees is a society.

66
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:43,670
Okay?

67
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:45,770
It says nothing be on society.

68
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,060
It doesn't seem nature.

69
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:47,530
Okay.

70
00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:47,720
I mean,

71
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:49,010
it's absolutely mad.

72
00:01:49,011 --> 00:01:49,700
Okay,

73
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:51,800
how are you going to have
a system being taught,

74
00:01:51,801 --> 00:01:52,011
okay?

75
00:01:52,011 --> 00:01:52,844
And universities,

76
00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:53,210
right?

77
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:53,480
Which,

78
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:53,691
which,

79
00:01:53,691 --> 00:01:54,050
which,

80
00:01:54,050 --> 00:01:56,390
which thinks at this
tiny thing of society.

81
00:01:56,391 --> 00:01:56,840
Okay.

82
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:59,570
Compared to the enormity
and beauty of nature,

83
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:01,123
it should take all of,

84
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:01,690
you know,

85
00:02:01,690 --> 00:02:02,510
all of our,

86
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:02,751
you know,

87
00:02:02,751 --> 00:02:04,850
absorb all of our energy and attention.

88
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:05,360
So,

89
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:05,571
I mean,

90
00:02:05,571 --> 00:02:09,440
I just think that there's like a
parochialism and provincialism uh,

91
00:02:09,441 --> 00:02:09,920
you know,

92
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:12,080
it and now all kinds of,

93
00:02:12,081 --> 00:02:12,360
um,

94
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,193
you know,

95
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:14,330
systematized,

96
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:16,770
elite TISM in our current education.

97
00:02:16,771 --> 00:02:18,220
It's got to be rooted out and we,

98
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:19,700
I want to return to basics.

99
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:20,301
Great.

100
00:02:20,301 --> 00:02:25,010
Simplicities and all these faculty
members teaching their little tiny courses

101
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:25,521
that have to,

102
00:02:25,521 --> 00:02:26,900
has to do with our own specialty.

103
00:02:26,901 --> 00:02:27,740
That's got to stop.

104
00:02:27,741 --> 00:02:28,400
What can people,

105
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,190
people can pursue whatever they
want in their private research.

106
00:02:31,191 --> 00:02:31,880
A scholars.

107
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:32,270
Okay.

108
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:33,470
Certainly that's necessary,

109
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:37,680
but they must teach in
the core curriculum and,

110
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:41,660
and people must decide what is crucial
for an educated person to know.

111
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,220
I do want a multicultural.

112
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:45,260
I do want to global
curriculum like I want,

113
00:02:45,261 --> 00:02:46,940
I want all the cultures taught.

114
00:02:46,941 --> 00:02:47,260
Okay.

115
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:47,960
Right.

116
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,310
This is not the answer.

117
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:50,750
Martin Marxism,

118
00:02:50,751 --> 00:02:52,880
this neo Marxism in the university's okay.

119
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,020
Is simply,

120
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:55,130
it's lazy.

121
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:59,540
It's a lazy way to assert multiculturalism
without actually doing the research

122
00:02:59,541 --> 00:03:01,730
and the study of other cultures.

123
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,250
Okay.

124
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:05,083
All right.

125
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:07,640
We agreed on everything.

126
00:03:07,641 --> 00:03:09,310
I knew this.

127
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,120
I knew that.

128
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:10,371
All right,

129
00:03:10,371 --> 00:03:10,730
great.
