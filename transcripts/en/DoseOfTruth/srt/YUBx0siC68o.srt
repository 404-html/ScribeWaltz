1
00:00:03,690 --> 00:00:05,220
I'm a psychoanalytic thinker.

2
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:10,130
And what that means is that I believe
that people are collections of some

3
00:00:10,131 --> 00:00:13,050
personalities and that those
subpersonalities are alive.

4
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:14,730
They're not machines.

5
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:15,990
They're there.

6
00:00:15,991 --> 00:00:17,160
They have their viewpoint,

7
00:00:17,161 --> 00:00:18,120
they have their wants,

8
00:00:18,121 --> 00:00:19,860
they have their perceptions,

9
00:00:19,861 --> 00:00:20,970
they have their arguments,

10
00:00:20,971 --> 00:00:22,110
they have their emotions,

11
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:22,680
they're,

12
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:25,440
they're like low resolution
representations of you.

13
00:00:25,441 --> 00:00:25,681
You know,

14
00:00:25,681 --> 00:00:26,461
when you get angry,

15
00:00:26,461 --> 00:00:27,150
it's like,

16
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:29,670
it's a very low resolution
representation of you.

17
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:33,150
It only wants rage or it only want
something to eat or only once,

18
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:35,430
only once water only wants sex.

19
00:00:35,431 --> 00:00:35,940
It's,

20
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:36,271
it's,

21
00:00:36,271 --> 00:00:36,811
it's you,

22
00:00:36,811 --> 00:00:37,760
but shrunken,

23
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:39,780
focused in a specific direction.

24
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:40,560
And,

25
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:41,820
and those,

26
00:00:41,821 --> 00:00:44,070
all those motivational systems are very,

27
00:00:44,071 --> 00:00:44,940
very ancient,

28
00:00:44,941 --> 00:00:46,320
very archaic and very,

29
00:00:46,321 --> 00:00:47,220
very powerful.

30
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:51,480
And they you up determining role in the
manner in which we manifest ourselves.

31
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:54,090
As Freud pointed out with the kid,

32
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:59,070
we have to figure out how to take all
those underlying animalistic motivations

33
00:00:59,071 --> 00:01:04,071
and emotions and civilize them in some
way so that we can all live in this same

34
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:07,350
general territory without
tearing each other to shreds,

35
00:01:07,351 --> 00:01:11,760
which is maybe the default position
of both chimpanzee and humanity.

36
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:13,343
So,

37
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:15,300
so I take that seriously.

38
00:01:15,301 --> 00:01:19,700
The idea that we're a loose collection
of spirits and that that that,

39
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:23,400
that you know what it says in the Old
Testament somewhere that the fear of God

40
00:01:23,401 --> 00:01:26,010
is the beginning of wisdom and
I think this is akin to that.

41
00:01:26,011 --> 00:01:30,210
If you know that you're not in control
of yourself thoroughly and that there are

42
00:01:30,211 --> 00:01:32,370
other factors behind the scenes,

43
00:01:32,371 --> 00:01:37,020
like the Greeks thought that human
beings where the play things of the gods,

44
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,140
that's the way they
conceptualize the world.

45
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:40,800
They sort of meant the same thing.

46
00:01:40,801 --> 00:01:44,880
They meant that there are these
great forces that that move us,

47
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:46,800
that we don't create that were,

48
00:01:46,801 --> 00:01:47,460
that were,

49
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:49,380
that were subordinate to in some sense,

50
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:50,250
not entirely,

51
00:01:50,251 --> 00:01:53,130
but we could be subordinate to
them and they move our destinies.

52
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:54,450
That was the Greek view,

53
00:01:54,451 --> 00:01:56,440
and there's something indeed it,

54
00:01:56,530 --> 00:01:59,410
it teaches you humility
to understand that,

55
00:01:59,411 --> 00:01:59,880
that,

56
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:03,240
that there's a hell of a lot more
going on behind the scenes and you're,

57
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:05,490
you're the driver of a
very complex vehicle,

58
00:02:05,491 --> 00:02:07,560
but you don't understand
the vehicle very well.

59
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:12,120
And it's got its own motivations and
methods and sometimes you think it's doing

60
00:02:12,121 --> 00:02:14,070
something and it's doing
something completely,

61
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:15,240
completely different.

62
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,970
You see that in psychotherapy
all the time because you know,

63
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:22,380
you help someone unwind a pattern of
behavior that they've manifested forever.

64
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:23,071
First of all,

65
00:02:23,071 --> 00:02:23,791
they describe it,

66
00:02:23,791 --> 00:02:25,020
then they become aware of it.

67
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:27,090
Then maybe they start to
see what the cause is.

68
00:02:27,091 --> 00:02:29,310
They had no idea why they
were acting like that.

69
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:29,701
You know,

70
00:02:29,701 --> 00:02:34,701
they have to have the memory that produced
the behavioral pattern to begin with.

71
00:02:34,711 --> 00:02:38,940
It has to be brought back to mind and
then it has to be analyzed and assessed

72
00:02:38,941 --> 00:02:41,160
and then they have to think
about a different way of acting.

73
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:43,260
And it's extraordinarily complex.
