1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:02,250
What is my opinion on open
relationships,

2
00:00:02,251 --> 00:00:05,070
polyamory,
other forms of non monogamy?

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:08,570
Well,
I think that as a medium to longterm

4
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:11,790
strategy,
they're completely untenable because

5
00:00:11,791 --> 00:00:13,740
human beings,
as far as I'm concerned,

6
00:00:13,741 --> 00:00:15,990
are fundamentally pair bonding and you
know,

7
00:00:15,991 --> 00:00:19,110
if you're just talking about casual sex,
first of all,

8
00:00:19,111 --> 00:00:21,420
I think casual sex is a contradiction in
terms.

9
00:00:21,421 --> 00:00:24,270
I don't think there's anything about sex
that's casual and I think that people

10
00:00:24,271 --> 00:00:27,810
are deceiving themselves badly whenever
they think so they might like to live in

11
00:00:27,811 --> 00:00:28,420
a,
you know,

12
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:31,170
19 seventies playboy,
adolescent fantasy.

13
00:00:31,171 --> 00:00:33,810
But I don't,
I've never seen that work under any

14
00:00:33,811 --> 00:00:37,050
circumstances whatsoever.
And I think people get hurt badly.

15
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:39,960
It's also a bad medium to longterm
strategy because,

16
00:00:40,330 --> 00:00:41,730
you know,
pair bonding is a,

17
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:45,360
is the most stable arrangement we know
of at least so far.

18
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,100
Well,
I won't even put it that way.

19
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:52,100
It's the only stable a mode of being
that we know for the long run and that's

20
00:00:52,291 --> 00:00:54,750
especially the case when you bring
children into the equation.

21
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:56,360
So,
um,

22
00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:00,330
I think it's delusional fundamentally.
And I think that people who are,

23
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:02,550
who believe that such things work.
I mean,

24
00:01:02,551 --> 00:01:05,640
sometimes they're open people in their
creative and their exploratory and all

25
00:01:05,641 --> 00:01:08,310
of that and fair enough,
but often they're just unconscientious

26
00:01:08,311 --> 00:01:11,550
and they don't want to take any
responsibility and they want to live in

27
00:01:11,551 --> 00:01:14,910
this wish fulfillment fantasy where
everybody can have all the sex they want

28
00:01:14,911 --> 00:01:18,150
all the time and it's always wonderful
and no one gets hurt and it's like,

29
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:19,950
sorry,
that just doesn't work in the real

30
00:01:19,951 --> 00:01:20,280
world.
