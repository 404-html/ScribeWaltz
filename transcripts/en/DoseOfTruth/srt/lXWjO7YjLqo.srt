1
00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:12,970
One of the things that's really struck
me about intellectual life is how often

2
00:00:14,991 --> 00:00:19,460
we get the questions wrong and
we often get them backwards,

3
00:00:19,461 --> 00:00:20,151
not just wrong,

4
00:00:20,151 --> 00:00:21,290
but actually backwards.

5
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:23,810
So as a clinical psychologist,

6
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:27,570
I've often treated people
with anxiety and uh,

7
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:32,540
people wonder practically individually,

8
00:00:32,541 --> 00:00:33,290
clinically,

9
00:00:33,290 --> 00:00:35,060
why are people anxious?

10
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:39,230
And I think that's a
completely ridiculous question.

11
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:40,933
It,

12
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:43,870
the reasons for anxiety
are starkly self evident.

13
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:49,400
What I wonder is why aren't
people terrified out of
their skulls so badly every

14
00:00:49,401 --> 00:00:51,770
second of their life that
they can't even move?

15
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:53,721
Yeah.

16
00:00:53,721 --> 00:00:56,990
And you all laugh because you
understand that it's like anxiety.

17
00:00:56,991 --> 00:00:57,980
That's no mystery.

18
00:00:57,981 --> 00:01:01,280
It's like brief spells of calm.

19
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,140
That's a mystery.

20
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:06,643
Okay.

21
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:08,300
Client will come to me and say,

22
00:01:08,301 --> 00:01:09,080
well,

23
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:10,370
I'm procrastinating.

24
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:12,230
Why do I procrastinate?

25
00:01:12,231 --> 00:01:12,950
It's like,

26
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:13,341
no,

27
00:01:13,341 --> 00:01:14,570
that's a stupid question.

28
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:17,840
It's easy just to sit
there and do nothing.

29
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:22,880
What's the mystery is why you ever get
up and do anything difficult at all?

30
00:01:22,910 --> 00:01:24,830
Procrastination is the default.

31
00:01:24,831 --> 00:01:27,140
And psychologists ask,

32
00:01:27,141 --> 00:01:27,921
doctors ask,

33
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:28,340
well,

34
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:30,110
why do people take cocaine?

35
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:31,010
It's like,

36
00:01:31,010 --> 00:01:31,843
no,

37
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:32,843
no.

38
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:37,640
It's the wrong question.

39
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:39,811
The right quest.

40
00:01:39,811 --> 00:01:40,644
It is.

41
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:45,230
Why not like an addicted rat?

42
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:48,770
Don't you just take cocaine
all the time until you die.

43
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,190
That's the quest.

44
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,480
And this question about
meaning is like that too.

45
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:55,940
Is there meaning in life?

46
00:01:56,930 --> 00:01:58,280
That's a stupid question.

47
00:01:59,480 --> 00:01:59,890
It's,

48
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:00,170
I'm,

49
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:01,460
I'm serious about that.

50
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:05,030
That's not a question you ever
ask yourself if you're in pain,

51
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:06,890
right?

52
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:08,180
Because when you're in pain,

53
00:02:08,181 --> 00:02:09,590
you know that life has a meaning.

54
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:14,270
It's the pain and you can't argue
yourself out of that meeting.

55
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:18,230
And so when we're asking
whether or not life has meaning,

56
00:02:18,231 --> 00:02:19,370
that isn't what we mean.

57
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:24,200
What we mean is in the face
of life's pain and suffering,

58
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:26,780
does life have any positive meaning?

59
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:29,630
And that is not the same question.

60
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:32,203
Now,

61
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,680
when you leave that aside for a minute,

62
00:02:33,681 --> 00:02:36,860
and I'm going to tell you a little story,

63
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:38,330
a little experiment.

64
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:43,930
I remember in 1989 when
the Berlin wall fell down,

65
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:49,880
there was a great celebration in Berlin
and the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra

66
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:55,210
played a part in it and they came out
to a section of the wall that had been

67
00:02:55,431 --> 00:02:59,980
knocked down where there was
a huge crowd and played ninth.

68
00:02:59,981 --> 00:03:01,780
And I remember watching that,

69
00:03:01,781 --> 00:03:03,700
the great third movement,

70
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:05,740
the triumphant third movement,

71
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:10,690
and it was so wonderful to see
everyone there and here this orchestra

72
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:18,360
playing those unbelievably remarkable
notes in triumph that this horror show had

73
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:22,030
finally come to a halt.

74
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:24,220
You can imagine someone

75
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:30,870
critically minded and rational and an
event like that standing behind you as

76
00:03:31,391 --> 00:03:36,370
you're listening to the great strains
of that symphony manifest themselves,

77
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:38,290
tap you on the shoulder and say,

78
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:41,253
well,

79
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:42,843
you know

80
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:45,360
that's symphony is going to end.

81
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:48,930
What makes you think it
has any meaning at all?

82
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:50,241
It's like,

83
00:03:50,241 --> 00:03:50,840
well,

84
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:53,180
how do you respond to something like that?

85
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:59,020
You say you should reconsider the
way you're looking at the world,

86
00:03:59,421 --> 00:04:00,254
their buddy,

87
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:04,190
because that's just not the right answer.

88
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:06,500
It's just not the right question.

89
00:04:06,770 --> 00:04:11,270
It's like the symphony has no
meaning because it ends well.

90
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:13,580
You're not paying attention
to what's going on.

91
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:18,230
If that's the way you think or
maybe you're thinking too much.

92
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:18,770
Yes,

93
00:04:18,770 --> 00:04:22,220
you're thinking too much and not paying
enough attention and that is more

94
00:04:22,221 --> 00:04:26,060
serious than that and this
ties in the issue of pain.

95
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:29,300
Say What does it all matter?

96
00:04:29,301 --> 00:04:33,770
If in 10 billion years the earth is going
to fall into or this sun is going to

97
00:04:33,771 --> 00:04:36,080
expand and consume the earth,

98
00:04:36,081 --> 00:04:37,400
what difference does it make?

99
00:04:37,401 --> 00:04:38,234
And I would say,

100
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:39,583
well,

101
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:43,190
is that that kind of answer you're
going to give to a child that's in pain?

102
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,020
That's your answer.

103
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:46,730
It's like,

104
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:47,570
Hey,

105
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:49,520
you've got the flu.

106
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,081
You're anxious,

107
00:04:51,081 --> 00:04:52,160
you're having a nightmare.

108
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:55,130
You're in terrible pain,

109
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:57,620
but in 10 million years,

110
00:04:57,621 --> 00:04:59,540
who the hell is going
to know the difference?

111
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:02,901
Yeah.

112
00:05:02,901 --> 00:05:03,261
Right.

113
00:05:03,261 --> 00:05:03,890
No kidding.

114
00:05:03,890 --> 00:05:05,270
It's like you don't.

115
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:09,323
Yeah.

116
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:10,410
If the question is,

117
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:13,680
if that response is
observed in that situation,

118
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:15,390
then it's an absurd response.

119
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:20,900
The mere fact that you can come up with
a timeframe across which your current

120
00:05:21,031 --> 00:05:26,031
activity is meaningless only means that
you're capable of playing with meanings

121
00:05:26,551 --> 00:05:27,720
across timeframes.

122
00:05:27,721 --> 00:05:29,730
It doesn't mean anything
at all about meaning.

123
00:05:29,731 --> 00:05:30,660
As far as I can tell,

124
00:05:30,661 --> 00:05:35,220
is it absolutely obligatory that
everything that's meaningful has to be

125
00:05:35,221 --> 00:05:39,030
significant in some
unimaginable distant future?

126
00:05:39,031 --> 00:05:40,350
Why is that the hallmark?

127
00:05:40,351 --> 00:05:41,310
Why would you just say,

128
00:05:41,311 --> 00:05:41,461
hey,

129
00:05:41,461 --> 00:05:42,294
here's an idea.

130
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:47,460
Why don't you stop conceptualizing your
life across tight timeframes that takes

131
00:05:47,461 --> 00:05:49,350
all the positive meaning out of them.

132
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,570
How would that be for his suggestion?

133
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:56,750
Maybe the fact that posing the question
in that way makes you feel miserable and

134
00:05:57,831 --> 00:06:02,750
wretched and few tile is an indication
that there's something wrong with posing

135
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:04,250
the question in that manner.

136
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:05,091
And you might say,

137
00:06:05,091 --> 00:06:05,271
well,

138
00:06:05,271 --> 00:06:07,100
there's nothing wrong
with posing questions.

139
00:06:07,101 --> 00:06:07,581
And I would say,

140
00:06:07,581 --> 00:06:11,060
well that brings us back to
the child in pain problem.

141
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:17,800
Sometimes there is a problem with posing
questions in a certain way and what

142
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:22,760
difference is it gonna make in 10
million years is not a sufficient

143
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:27,100
response to someone who's suffering.

144
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:28,571
And then you might say,

145
00:06:28,571 --> 00:06:28,781
well,

146
00:06:28,781 --> 00:06:29,500
we could,

147
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,180
we could expand that idea.

148
00:06:31,181 --> 00:06:34,270
Even we could take play
with that idea of suffering.

149
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:35,531
We could say,

150
00:06:35,531 --> 00:06:36,364
well,

151
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:38,440
maybe it's a child in Auschwitz,

152
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:39,303
you know,

153
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:43,780
and this suffering isn't merely
a consequence of an illness.

154
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:45,910
Not that that's trivial,

155
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:50,350
but the suffering is the
consequence of conscious malevolent.

156
00:06:50,770 --> 00:06:51,850
How about that?

157
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:55,810
And the purpose of the malevolence
is just to make things worse.

158
00:06:55,970 --> 00:06:56,410
And,

159
00:06:56,410 --> 00:06:59,920
and to top it all off because
malevolence is a form of art.

160
00:06:59,921 --> 00:07:01,780
It's not only to make things worse,

161
00:07:01,781 --> 00:07:05,170
it's to make things worse in the
worst possible imaginable way,

162
00:07:05,171 --> 00:07:10,171
which is basically to amplify this
suffering of someone maximumly innocent in

163
00:07:10,961 --> 00:07:13,270
the most pointless way possible.

164
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:15,611
Well,

165
00:07:15,611 --> 00:07:16,060
what,

166
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:17,380
what's your answer to that?

167
00:07:17,590 --> 00:07:18,423
It's like

168
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:21,800
10 million years.

169
00:07:21,801 --> 00:07:23,060
What difference is it going to make?

170
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:25,700
Life is fundamentally meaningless.

171
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:27,680
It's like what kind of answers that

172
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:32,820
it's an answer that shows that the
framework within which that question is

173
00:07:32,821 --> 00:07:34,230
generated is invalid.

174
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,660
That's what kind of answer it is.

175
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:44,910
All right.

176
00:07:44,910 --> 00:07:49,440
I realized a while back that I had
gone through a process when I was in my

177
00:07:49,441 --> 00:07:50,274
twenties.

178
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:54,370
It was akin to something Descartes did.

179
00:07:54,910 --> 00:07:57,070
I'm not trying to compare
myself to Descartes.

180
00:07:57,490 --> 00:07:58,323
Um,

181
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:00,333
but he was,

182
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:05,340
he was trying to look for something that
he couldn't doubt and the consequence

183
00:08:05,711 --> 00:08:06,820
of his search was,

184
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:09,660
I think therefore I am,

185
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:14,210
which I don't think is exactly a good
translation of what Descartes meant.

186
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:18,480
I think he meant something more like
I can't dispute the reality of my own

187
00:08:18,481 --> 00:08:19,320
consciousness.

188
00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:20,580
Something like that.

189
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:21,833
And that's good.

190
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:26,520
That isn't where I got
to in my contemplations.

191
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:32,540
I was looking for something that I
regarded as in controvertible and I was

192
00:08:34,231 --> 00:08:37,450
fortunate at that time because I
was reading Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn,

193
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:39,090
Solzhenitsyn Road,

194
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:41,760
the Gulag archipelago
among many other things.

195
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:46,950
The Gulag archipelago is a description
of the absolute catastrophes of the

196
00:08:46,951 --> 00:08:51,951
Soviet state and the entanglement of
the individual psyches of the Soviet

197
00:08:53,101 --> 00:08:58,101
citizens in that catastrophe descent into
deceit and cruelty to seat resentment

198
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,850
and cruelty when Solzhenitsyn,

199
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:07,470
the Gulag archipelago that he thought
the Nuremberg trials were the most

200
00:09:07,471 --> 00:09:09,990
important event of the 20th century.

201
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:11,880
And the reason he said that

202
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:19,430
was because the Nuremberg
judgment for better or worse,

203
00:09:19,501 --> 00:09:24,501
was that there were some acts that were
so viciously brutal that there was no

204
00:09:26,581 --> 00:09:29,760
excuse whatsoever for engaging in them,

205
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:34,940
no matter who you were or what your
culture was or what your rationale was.

206
00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:36,203
And so for,

207
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:36,811
for soldier,

208
00:09:36,811 --> 00:09:37,644
an incident,

209
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:45,320
the Nuremberg trials established what
you might describe as the transcendent

210
00:09:46,171 --> 00:09:47,460
reality of evil.

211
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,670
And that's an unbelievably useful thing.

212
00:09:50,671 --> 00:09:55,500
It's akin to this idea of
suffering in my estimation because,

213
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:58,171
well,

214
00:09:58,171 --> 00:10:01,770
it's the child in there
in Auschwitz problem that

215
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:04,960
you need an answer

216
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:10,690
to the problem posed by
the suffering of innocence

217
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:14,260
as a consequence of malevolent.

218
00:10:15,010 --> 00:10:15,843
You say that's,

219
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:17,600
that's a,

220
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,433
that's evil.

221
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:24,200
The conscious exaggeration of unnecessary
suffering and that gives you a vantage

222
00:10:25,181 --> 00:10:26,920
point that's wrong.

223
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:29,020
Whatever it is that is,

224
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:30,550
that's wrong.

225
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,460
Well then you have

226
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,350
a place to stand.

227
00:10:36,351 --> 00:10:36,861
You can say,

228
00:10:36,861 --> 00:10:37,160
oh,

229
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:37,491
okay,

230
00:10:37,491 --> 00:10:42,491
now I know that there's something that's
wrong and now non trivial way in a way

231
00:10:42,561 --> 00:10:44,420
that tech can't be just dispensed with,

232
00:10:44,421 --> 00:10:47,270
with rational objections

233
00:10:50,010 --> 00:10:53,700
that emerge as a consequence of
contemplation of the boundedness of life.

234
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:59,430
Those answers aren't serious
enough to address the issue.

235
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:02,513
Well.

236
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:04,721
So I thought,

237
00:11:04,721 --> 00:11:05,021
okay,

238
00:11:05,021 --> 00:11:06,880
well I found something that I can

239
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:12,130
grip onto or stand on without dispute.

240
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:18,000
There are acts that are unquestionably
evil and that means that there are acts

241
00:11:18,371 --> 00:11:19,720
that are unquestionably good.

242
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:20,921
Now,

243
00:11:20,921 --> 00:11:23,230
it doesn't mean that
we know what they are,

244
00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:23,951
right?

245
00:11:23,951 --> 00:11:26,350
Because just because you
know one pole of something,

246
00:11:26,351 --> 00:11:27,800
it doesn't necessarily mean you know.

247
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:28,420
The other.

248
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:33,420
I could say that whatever leads us as
far as way as we can possibly get from

249
00:11:34,421 --> 00:11:35,470
Auschwitz,

250
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:37,330
that's good.

251
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:39,473
Well

252
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:44,830
are being turned to puzzle out
what that might be for 25 years.

253
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:48,130
To outline it in a practical manner,

254
00:11:48,131 --> 00:11:50,200
I suppose in an abstract manner,

255
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:55,420
to understand if there's a root,

256
00:11:56,970 --> 00:11:57,850
a mode of being,

257
00:11:57,851 --> 00:12:01,900
let's say that takes us
away from undue suffering,

258
00:12:01,901 --> 00:12:06,901
but more than that takes us away from
undue suffering multiplied by malevolence.

259
00:12:09,330 --> 00:12:12,460
He said it's a fundamental
existential problem of life.

260
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:13,900
We all suffer.

261
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:15,190
That's the meaning of life.

262
00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:16,143
We all suffer.

263
00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:21,210
The suffering is exacerbated by the
malevolence in our hearts and the

264
00:12:21,491 --> 00:12:23,800
malevolence in the hearts of all of us

265
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:31,120
and the paramount issue that
faces us is what to do about that,

266
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:37,070
and the answer is I think

267
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:43,730
live a life that manifests itself as
meaningful because it seems to me that the

268
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,860
meaning isn't a rational phenomena.

269
00:12:49,861 --> 00:12:51,870
It's not something that you create.

270
00:12:51,871 --> 00:12:52,980
This is where Nietzsche,

271
00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:54,510
I think got it wrong.

272
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:57,260
He believed that as a consequence
of the death of God we had,

273
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:58,740
we would have to create our own values.

274
00:12:58,950 --> 00:13:00,990
We would have to become gods ourselves,

275
00:13:01,170 --> 00:13:01,830
so to speak.

276
00:13:01,830 --> 00:13:02,663
Okay.

277
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:07,280
But I don't think that Nisha was right
because I don't think that we can create

278
00:13:07,281 --> 00:13:07,881
our own values.

279
00:13:07,881 --> 00:13:09,410
I think that we have to discover them.

280
00:13:10,610 --> 00:13:11,900
And I think that what we discover,

281
00:13:11,901 --> 00:13:13,430
our eternal values,

282
00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:18,200
and I think that the eternal values
that are discoverable are precisely the

283
00:13:18,201 --> 00:13:21,470
values that lead us away from
the pathway to perdition.

284
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:24,680
It was characterized by
places such as Auschwitz.

285
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:27,890
And I also think that
we all know this now.

286
00:13:27,891 --> 00:13:31,040
It's not that we can't question
it because we can question it,

287
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:34,400
but the questioning is in some sense,

288
00:13:34,401 --> 00:13:35,211
beside the point,

289
00:13:35,211 --> 00:13:40,211
like the person objecting to the Grand
Juror grandier of Beethoven's ninth by

290
00:13:42,531 --> 00:13:44,390
pointing out that it's going to end.

291
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,970
The questioning is beside the point.

292
00:13:47,090 --> 00:13:48,500
It's missing the point.

293
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:55,430
I've studied a variety
of great psychologists,

294
00:13:55,790 --> 00:13:58,190
John Piaget and Carl Young and,

295
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:03,850
and Freud and Carl Rogers,

296
00:14:03,851 --> 00:14:06,160
many of the great 20th century clinicians.

297
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:07,583
And,

298
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:17,420
and my stance is that along with
the biologists and the evolutionary

299
00:14:17,891 --> 00:14:18,880
psychologists that were,

300
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:24,390
we're starting to map out the pathway
that might be the opposite of the

301
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:31,200
catastrophic motive being that leads
us into pits of hell like Auschwitz.

302
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:34,660
And that there's something
genuinely real about it.

303
00:14:35,010 --> 00:14:36,190
Like seriously,

304
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:37,623
real,

305
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:39,310
metaphorically real,

306
00:14:39,311 --> 00:14:40,540
and literally real,

307
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:45,110
both at the same time that the instinct
to meaning that you experience,

308
00:14:45,111 --> 00:14:45,581
for example,

309
00:14:45,581 --> 00:14:47,110
when you listen to something great,

310
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:47,750
that,

311
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:48,160
that,

312
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:53,020
that experience of meaning that
overcomes you isn't some EPR phenomena.

313
00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:54,230
It's not something,

314
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:58,730
some mirror reflection of
some more fundamental process,

315
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:03,470
but that which is more
fundamental than anything else

316
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:06,221
say,

317
00:15:06,221 --> 00:15:06,790
well,

318
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:11,790
you can't deny that pain is real and
suffering is real and you can't deny that

319
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:18,270
suffering induced by malevolence is
the worst of all possible sufferings.

320
00:15:19,330 --> 00:15:21,490
Those are all undeniable
as far as I'm concerned.

321
00:15:21,491 --> 00:15:26,491
Those are all meanings of life and the
real enough so that if you encounter

322
00:15:26,951 --> 00:15:27,161
them,

323
00:15:27,161 --> 00:15:28,960
like if you encounter true malevolence,

324
00:15:28,961 --> 00:15:31,930
the probability that you'll walk
away from it and escape this is very,

325
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:32,764
very low.

326
00:15:32,930 --> 00:15:36,850
It will damage you psychophysiological
and you might never recover.

327
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:39,010
And that's real enough for me.

328
00:15:41,930 --> 00:15:42,763
Well,

329
00:15:43,330 --> 00:15:44,001
it is.

330
00:15:44,001 --> 00:15:45,620
The path away from that real

331
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:49,670
is the path that transcends that real.

332
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:51,110
Maybe it's more real.

333
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:56,030
That's what I've come to believe as
pessimistic as I am about the nature of

334
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:57,380
humanity,

335
00:15:57,470 --> 00:15:58,880
myself included,

336
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:01,420
as,

337
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:01,710
as,

338
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:05,250
as real as I believe
suffering and evil to be.

339
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:10,980
It appears to me that the mode of
being that leads you away from that,

340
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:16,880
that enables you to bear the suffering
with nobility and to be useful to others

341
00:16:17,131 --> 00:16:22,131
who are in pain and to constrain the
malevolence in your own heart and around

342
00:16:22,321 --> 00:16:23,010
you.

343
00:16:23,010 --> 00:16:28,010
That that mode of being is more powerful
than that which it is set against.

344
00:16:29,370 --> 00:16:30,091
And not only that,

345
00:16:30,091 --> 00:16:31,920
I think that we experienced this.

346
00:16:31,921 --> 00:16:32,910
I think we experienced it.

347
00:16:32,911 --> 00:16:34,290
We just don't notice.

348
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:38,580
Maybe because we're too busy thinking
because noticing and thinking aren't the

349
00:16:38,581 --> 00:16:43,581
same thing we see in our own lives
when we're engaged in something deeply

350
00:16:44,071 --> 00:16:44,640
meaningful.

351
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:46,290
Music is the best pathway to that.

352
00:16:46,291 --> 00:16:47,670
I think it's the most,

353
00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:50,700
it's the most rapid and
indisputable pathway to that.

354
00:16:50,701 --> 00:16:51,211
Everyone,

355
00:16:51,211 --> 00:16:54,660
virtually everyone loves music
and music speaks of meaning.

356
00:16:55,660 --> 00:17:00,060
It doesn't directly and it shows you
what life would be like if it was ordered

357
00:17:00,061 --> 00:17:03,450
and harmonious and you were
dancing along with it properly.

358
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:08,720
It gives you an intimation
of psychological integrity,

359
00:17:10,190 --> 00:17:12,990
but you watched your lives day to day,

360
00:17:12,991 --> 00:17:13,561
week to week,

361
00:17:13,561 --> 00:17:14,101
month to month.

362
00:17:14,101 --> 00:17:17,550
You'll notice that there are times when
you're so deeply engaged in what you're

363
00:17:17,551 --> 00:17:18,210
doing.

364
00:17:18,210 --> 00:17:23,210
What you're doing is so meaningful in the
kind of meaning that announces itself,

365
00:17:23,731 --> 00:17:25,140
not the kind that you're creating,

366
00:17:25,141 --> 00:17:26,580
that life is so meaningful.

367
00:17:26,581 --> 00:17:27,414
You think

368
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:30,840
this is worth the suffering.

369
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:33,201
Let me think.

370
00:17:33,201 --> 00:17:34,130
Well that's meaning,

371
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:35,413
right?

372
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:38,270
Meaning is what makes
the suffering worthwhile.

373
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:39,890
Is that real?

374
00:17:40,850 --> 00:17:42,170
It's not something you think up.

375
00:17:42,171 --> 00:17:45,650
It's something that you
discover and you can watch.

376
00:17:45,651 --> 00:17:47,570
You could see day to day,

377
00:17:47,571 --> 00:17:49,260
minute to minute,

378
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:49,980
hour to hour,

379
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:50,813
week to week.

380
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:55,970
You can see when you're
conducting yourself or being
conducted in a manner that

381
00:17:56,341 --> 00:18:01,140
allows that meaning to reveal
itself in a way that in the moment,

382
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:05,130
even if you don't notice
the conditions of your life,

383
00:18:05,131 --> 00:18:07,140
justify themselves and,

384
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:12,210
and that's really saying something because
pain and suffering and malevolence or

385
00:18:12,211 --> 00:18:17,211
real and for something to justify that
it's really something for something to

386
00:18:19,171 --> 00:18:20,190
justify that.

387
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:23,010
But will you find that you find it in art,

388
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:24,060
you find it in literature,

389
00:18:24,061 --> 00:18:27,000
you find it in the relationships
you have with others.

390
00:18:27,001 --> 00:18:30,330
If those relationships are
founded on trust and truth,

391
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:33,570
you find it in what you say and do.

392
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:35,880
If what you say and do
comes from the heart,

393
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:38,610
you can experience that.

394
00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:43,900
The price of experiencing it,

395
00:18:43,901 --> 00:18:45,280
I would say is two fold.

396
00:18:47,530 --> 00:18:49,570
You have to take responsibility for being,

397
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:54,140
you have to do that voluntarily and
that means that you have to take

398
00:18:54,141 --> 00:18:59,141
responsibility for the suffering of being
an excepted and work to ameliorate it.

399
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:01,820
And you have to do that voluntarily.

400
00:19:01,821 --> 00:19:03,410
And that's a barrier,

401
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:06,920
I think very frequently
that arguments like,

402
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:07,491
well,

403
00:19:07,491 --> 00:19:12,491
what difference is it going to make 10
million years in the future aren't hyper

404
00:19:12,891 --> 00:19:16,760
rational objections to the
nature of being itself,

405
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:22,240
but hyper rationalistic
excuses for failing to bear
the responsibility of living

406
00:19:24,711 --> 00:19:25,311
properly,

407
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:26,240
moment to moment,

408
00:19:26,241 --> 00:19:28,400
and our tower there.

409
00:19:34,150 --> 00:19:34,983
Okay,

410
00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:38,540
say you have a child who's sick,

411
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:40,100
maybe one who's been hurt.

412
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:41,601
You say,

413
00:19:41,601 --> 00:19:42,434
well,

414
00:19:42,770 --> 00:19:45,050
what do you say or do in the face of that?

415
00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:47,863
Well,

416
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,033
you say,

417
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:52,193
Hey kid,

418
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:54,680
I'm here with you.

419
00:19:55,910 --> 00:19:57,140
I'm here beside you.

420
00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:05,270
Matters what's happening to you and
where to do everything we possibly can to

421
00:20:07,351 --> 00:20:09,810
get through this together.

422
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:12,421
And if you're lucky,

423
00:20:12,421 --> 00:20:12,931
you get a hug.

424
00:20:12,931 --> 00:20:15,510
And as a consequence
of that and you think,

425
00:20:15,570 --> 00:20:16,920
if you don't think that's meaningful,

426
00:20:16,921 --> 00:20:17,191
man,

427
00:20:17,191 --> 00:20:20,790
there's something wrong
with your soul and answer.

428
00:20:20,791 --> 00:20:23,400
What the hell difference is it
gonna make in 10 million years?

429
00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:25,830
That's the devil himself speaking.

430
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:30,541
Oh,

431
00:20:30,541 --> 00:20:31,290
that's good enough.
