1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:00,973
Hmm.

2
00:00:07,310 --> 00:00:12,050
If you hold something sacred,
then your team's circles around it and

3
00:00:12,051 --> 00:00:15,800
it's only those who circled around with
you and sometimes literally circled

4
00:00:15,801 --> 00:00:19,980
around like Muslims at prayer in Mecca,
they literally circle the kebabs.

5
00:00:19,981 --> 00:00:21,860
Circling is a very primitive,
ancient.

6
00:00:21,861 --> 00:00:24,980
It feels right to circle something,
but even if even if you do it

7
00:00:24,981 --> 00:00:28,970
symbolically or you all bow at the same
time that binds you together,

8
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:30,830
children do that with their mothers when
they,

9
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:33,490
when they engage in exploratory behavior
like,

10
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:37,640
well they use their mother as a center
of the world and children differ in the

11
00:00:37,641 --> 00:00:39,850
degree to which they'll move outward
from their mothers.

12
00:00:39,851 --> 00:00:42,540
So they move out until they,
they,

13
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:45,290
they trip over their uncertainty
threshold.

14
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:47,120
Neat.
Is it a distance,

15
00:00:47,121 --> 00:00:48,170
like it's a district that is.
Yeah,

16
00:00:48,171 --> 00:00:48,711
yeah.
Yeah.

17
00:00:48,711 --> 00:00:51,110
And so,
so the more exploratory kids who are

18
00:00:51,111 --> 00:00:54,170
lower negative emotion will go out
farther before they come back to their

19
00:00:54,171 --> 00:00:54,680
mother.

20
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:58,130
So the mother is the center and you know
that that would be associated

21
00:00:58,131 --> 00:01:01,520
symbolically with the idea of the center
has a motherland or potentially as a

22
00:01:01,521 --> 00:01:03,050
father like that's right.
That makes sense.

23
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:06,110
So this way that we're,
we're incredibly symbolic creatures.

24
00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:08,570
We're not just out to make as much money
as we can.

25
00:01:08,571 --> 00:01:12,170
Where's the symbolic and social
creatures and this psychology of

26
00:01:12,171 --> 00:01:15,500
sanctity or purity has become really
important,

27
00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:18,470
not just on the right.
It's always been important for

28
00:01:18,471 --> 00:01:22,220
especially religious conservatives were
beginning to see it even on the campus

29
00:01:22,221 --> 00:01:24,920
left,
and this is why I think we see some of

30
00:01:24,921 --> 00:01:29,921
the odd things we see on campus that the
campus must be kept as a sacred and pure

31
00:01:30,231 --> 00:01:32,900
space.
One of the things that really alarms me

32
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:37,040
about what's happened on campus and last
couple of years is that the older idea

33
00:01:37,041 --> 00:01:40,730
we had that it's a place for contesting
ideas.

34
00:01:40,910 --> 00:01:43,070
It's A.
It's a zone of enormous choice.

35
00:01:43,071 --> 00:01:45,770
People can take what courses they want,
say what they want.

36
00:01:45,771 --> 00:01:50,120
It's kind of a wonderful free for all
with some with norms of respect.

37
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:54,110
It's now becoming much more of a
religious zone where the perimeter of

38
00:01:54,111 --> 00:01:59,111
the campus is the boundaries and within
it they're almost their blasphemy laws

39
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,850
basically.
And I really started noticing this.

40
00:02:01,851 --> 00:02:04,400
When you look at the videos of the
Middlebury,

41
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:08,140
a protest when Charles Murray spoke at
Middlebury and as,

42
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:11,120
as everybody knows,
he was shouted down so the students are

43
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:15,410
chanting and they're chanting in unison
and it seems like a religious revival

44
00:02:15,411 --> 00:02:19,040
meeting and they're swaying and they're
saying they're sacred,

45
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:19,971
you know,
racist,

46
00:02:19,971 --> 00:02:21,380
sexist,
antigay,

47
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:24,470
Charles Murray go away.
It's like a ritual incantation.

48
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:28,670
Um,
so that all the space is safe and it's

49
00:02:28,671 --> 00:02:30,530
safe and maternal.
Not yet.

50
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:32,930
So far all this happening is they're
binding together.

51
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:35,540
They're moving and you know,
synchronous movement and call and

52
00:02:35,541 --> 00:02:38,690
response.
So it's using a lot of tropes from

53
00:02:38,691 --> 00:02:40,820
religion and religious worship.
But here's the cool thing,

54
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:43,460
when the administrator,
I forget who it is,

55
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:46,220
comes on to say,
okay,

56
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:48,740
we have moved,
we're moving the talk.

57
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:54,820
And then you hear a couple of people
screaming up off campus off campus and

58
00:02:55,611 --> 00:02:59,560
he says to another location on campus
and there's like,

59
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:01,390
oh no,
no,

60
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:04,840
because you know,
no one had to go to this talk.

61
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:09,250
So everyone could have just stayed at
home and the students did succeed in

62
00:03:09,251 --> 00:03:11,740
shutting down to venues.
They could have declared victory,

63
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:17,020
but it's not a full victory unless he is
physically off the campus.

64
00:03:17,021 --> 00:03:21,130
We can't have him speaking on campus
because that defiles us.

65
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:24,430
That pollutes us.
We must shut that down.

66
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:26,500
And that's where I started saying,
wow,

67
00:03:26,501 --> 00:03:29,620
this is like full blown psychology of
religion,

68
00:03:29,621 --> 00:03:30,820
Durkheim,
sanctity,

69
00:03:30,821 --> 00:03:34,030
purity blast for me.
And that I think,

70
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:35,830
you know,
that doesn't describe most students,

71
00:03:35,831 --> 00:03:37,840
but that describes this sort of the
core.

72
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:41,970
Those who who really have their identity
is wrapped up in this movement.
