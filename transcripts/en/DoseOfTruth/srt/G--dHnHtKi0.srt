1
00:00:01,170 --> 00:00:03,540
What is your view on psychological egoism?

2
00:00:03,541 --> 00:00:06,000
If we're all ultimately
acting out of self interest,

3
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:08,130
then does altruism have any merit?

4
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:11,130
I don't think the questions
well post and that's,

5
00:00:11,131 --> 00:00:13,980
it's one of those questions
that leads into a philosophical,

6
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:16,740
a dead end because it's not well post you.

7
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:19,350
There isn't any such
thing as self interest.

8
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:23,730
It's not the right way to think
about it because you're not alone.

9
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:26,040
And so this is why like Piaget,

10
00:00:26,041 --> 00:00:31,041
John Piaget cause he thought about
this intelligently look first of all,

11
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:33,210
who self interests do you meet?

12
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:35,970
Do you mean your immediate self
interest in the next second?

13
00:00:35,971 --> 00:00:37,320
So that would be impulsive pleasure.

14
00:00:37,321 --> 00:00:40,740
We're all acting for the gaining of
impulsive pleasure and to hell with

15
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:41,574
everything else.

16
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:46,050
Well obviously that's a stupid way to
behave because everyone knows that because

17
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:48,000
you can do impulsive,

18
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:52,770
short term gratifying things like snort
cocaine now and you can keep doing that

19
00:00:52,771 --> 00:00:54,300
and pay off real,

20
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:59,330
real well in the extremely short term and
they'll just auger you into the ground

21
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,840
in the medium to long term.

22
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:04,230
So if you're acting in
your own self interest,

23
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:05,970
let's take that apart.

24
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:11,990
Over what period of time your self
interest in the next second you're self

25
00:01:12,931 --> 00:01:14,220
interest in the next hour.

26
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:16,950
Like if you're impulsive and
you want to gratify an impulse,

27
00:01:16,951 --> 00:01:21,240
you're obviously acting in
your self interest in the
next second or the next two

28
00:01:21,241 --> 00:01:22,500
seconds or the next minute.

29
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:24,030
But you know you'll pay for that.

30
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:27,870
Maybe you punch someone or you slap
someone cause you're so angry and they,

31
00:01:27,871 --> 00:01:28,120
you know,

32
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:31,740
and they knock you for a loop and
then they charge you with assault.

33
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:32,851
You know,

34
00:01:32,851 --> 00:01:35,820
so well it was great in your
self interest in the second,

35
00:01:35,821 --> 00:01:37,380
but like future,

36
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:39,630
remember that Simpsons episode,

37
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:44,040
homer drank a quart of
Manet's and vodka and margin.

38
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:46,050
All his kids were telling
him not to and he said,

39
00:01:46,051 --> 00:01:47,670
well that's a problem for future homer.

40
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:49,710
I sure don't envy that guy.

41
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:50,311
It's like,

42
00:01:50,311 --> 00:01:52,080
which is one of the best
Simpson's lines ever,

43
00:01:52,081 --> 00:01:52,501
I think.

44
00:01:52,501 --> 00:01:53,460
And well that's it.

45
00:01:53,461 --> 00:01:53,971
Exactly.

46
00:01:53,971 --> 00:01:54,331
It's like,

47
00:01:54,331 --> 00:01:55,860
well there isn't just you.

48
00:01:55,861 --> 00:01:56,520
There's,

49
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:01,230
there's now you and there's tonight
you and there's tomorrow morning you,

50
00:02:01,231 --> 00:02:03,360
that's the one that'll have
the hangover by the way.

51
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:07,350
And there's next week you and next
month you and next year you and old you.

52
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,630
And so if you're going to
act in your self interest,

53
00:02:09,631 --> 00:02:14,631
you have to take that collective of use
across time into account when you make

54
00:02:14,761 --> 00:02:15,594
your decision.

55
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:17,670
And now here's the cool thing about that.

56
00:02:17,671 --> 00:02:21,180
So then that say well that would be
acting in your self interest writ large

57
00:02:21,181 --> 00:02:22,380
right across time spans,

58
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:27,860
but the thing is future you and someone
else that you have to live with right

59
00:02:27,871 --> 00:02:28,651
now that's not,

60
00:02:28,651 --> 00:02:30,750
you are pretty much the same people.

61
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:34,110
And so if you're going to act in your
self interest and you have other people

62
00:02:34,111 --> 00:02:34,561
around you,

63
00:02:34,561 --> 00:02:37,860
then you also want to act in their self
interest because otherwise they won't

64
00:02:37,861 --> 00:02:38,370
like you,

65
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:42,000
they won't cooperate with you and they
won't compete with you in a reasonable

66
00:02:42,001 --> 00:02:42,630
manner.

67
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:44,280
And so that's going to be a catastrophe.

68
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:49,640
And so you want to act out what's good
for you now and what's good for you next

69
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:53,520
month and next year and you want to do
that in a way that's good for you and

70
00:02:53,521 --> 00:02:55,980
your family and your community right now.

71
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:59,440
Next week and next year and you're
going to take all of those things into

72
00:02:59,441 --> 00:03:00,820
account at the same time.

73
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,390
That's an equivalent
rated game from Piaget,

74
00:03:03,391 --> 00:03:04,300
Gideon and perspective,

75
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:08,440
and it was his idea that that constituted
the basis for proper moral judgment

76
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,090
and it's a brilliant idea.

77
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:11,650
It's a brilliant idea.

78
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:13,990
And so that's your true self interest.

79
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:17,320
There's no difference between your
interest in the interest of others,

80
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:18,970
not in any fundamental sense,

81
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:20,110
even your enemies,

82
00:03:20,111 --> 00:03:24,280
which is why you're enjoying to treat
your enemy as if he was yourself.

83
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:25,810
Because he is,

84
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:26,631
you know,

85
00:03:26,631 --> 00:03:27,071
when you think,

86
00:03:27,071 --> 00:03:27,161
well,

87
00:03:27,161 --> 00:03:27,701
you should wish,

88
00:03:27,701 --> 00:03:28,120
well,

89
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,530
you should wish your enemies well.

90
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:30,573
Well why?

91
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:31,563
Well,

92
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:34,720
it isn't that you hope they
get a bigger house than you.

93
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,280
It's that let's say you're,

94
00:03:36,281 --> 00:03:39,700
you're being pursued and tormented
by someone who's truly reprehensible.

95
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:40,960
That person is,

96
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:42,520
they have a miserable life man.

97
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:43,421
In all likelihood,

98
00:03:43,421 --> 00:03:44,860
let's say they're truly malevolent,

99
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:49,500
you know they live in hell and what you
might hope for them is that they could

100
00:03:49,501 --> 00:03:52,300
figure out how to get out of there cause
it's not good for them and it's not

101
00:03:52,301 --> 00:03:53,920
good for anyone else think.

102
00:03:53,921 --> 00:03:54,041
Well,

103
00:03:54,041 --> 00:03:54,880
even your enemies,

104
00:03:54,881 --> 00:03:55,450
it's like,

105
00:03:55,450 --> 00:03:58,300
wouldn't it be good if they could get
their act together and stop being so

106
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,910
unnecessarily malevolent?

107
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:03,070
And that's in your self interest.

108
00:04:03,071 --> 00:04:07,390
So the idea that your self interest is
somehow opposed to other people's or that

109
00:04:07,391 --> 00:04:09,100
if you maximize yourself interest,

110
00:04:09,101 --> 00:04:14,101
you're not operating in the best interest
of other people is predicated on a

111
00:04:14,621 --> 00:04:18,400
poor idea of what constitutes your self
interest because you're not separate in

112
00:04:18,401 --> 00:04:19,840
any real sense from other people.

113
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:23,350
You maybe not separate from
everything in some real sense.

114
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:24,221
You know,

115
00:04:24,221 --> 00:04:25,054
I mean young,

116
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:29,020
young in his book mysterium
connectionists he had this idea,

117
00:04:29,021 --> 00:04:30,250
I'm going to go through it real quick.

118
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:34,480
It's a complicated idea that this
is how you put yourself together.

119
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:36,190
The first thing you do is you,

120
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:37,870
you join your emotions and your,

121
00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:38,980
and your rationality.

122
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:39,903
So that,

123
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:44,620
so that your mind and your emotions
are one thing he called out the first

124
00:04:44,621 --> 00:04:45,454
conjunction.

125
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:46,463
Um,

126
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:51,040
so that your motivations and your emotions
and the way that you think about the

127
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:52,840
world are all acting
in the same direction.

128
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:53,561
Okay?

129
00:04:53,561 --> 00:04:56,110
So that's the first conjunction and
you get your act together that way.

130
00:04:56,111 --> 00:05:00,400
So that would mean incorporation of
aggression and sexuality from a Freud in

131
00:05:00,401 --> 00:05:00,881
perspective,

132
00:05:00,881 --> 00:05:04,660
those parts of you that are difficult
to integrate come to be integrated into

133
00:05:04,661 --> 00:05:05,494
one thing.

134
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:10,180
So you can use your anger when you need
to and you have your sexuality under

135
00:05:10,181 --> 00:05:10,600
control.

136
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,530
It doesn't have you,

137
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:14,110
but you know how to use it
and it's a power for you.

138
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,393
Um,

139
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:16,593
and,

140
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:19,150
and you're properly assertive
in all of those things.

141
00:05:19,151 --> 00:05:23,260
And so you build yourself
into one psychological unit
and then you embody that.

142
00:05:23,261 --> 00:05:24,580
So that's the second conjunction.

143
00:05:24,581 --> 00:05:27,850
The second conjunction is take your mind,

144
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:28,751
emotion,

145
00:05:28,751 --> 00:05:29,650
motivation,

146
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:30,970
unity,

147
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:32,170
and acted out,

148
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:36,130
acted out in the world so that there's
no distinction between you and what you

149
00:05:36,131 --> 00:05:39,970
do between you and the way you think about
the world and your philosophy and how

150
00:05:39,971 --> 00:05:40,720
you act.

151
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,580
That makes you a second kind of unity.

152
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,530
And then the final conjunction,

153
00:05:44,531 --> 00:05:45,790
which is the most difficult one,

154
00:05:45,791 --> 00:05:49,360
is to stop thinking that the
world is different than you are.

155
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:51,940
This is why I ask people
to clean up the rooms.

156
00:05:51,941 --> 00:05:53,650
It's like your room is you,

157
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:55,143
it's you.

158
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:57,650
And so you go in there
and you up your room,

159
00:05:57,651 --> 00:06:00,890
your cleaning you up to the same
way you're developing discipline,

160
00:06:00,891 --> 00:06:02,150
you're putting yourself in order,

161
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:04,670
you're developing a vision of the future.

162
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,170
You're figuring out how to dress,

163
00:06:06,171 --> 00:06:08,390
you're figuring out how to
take care of your things.

164
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:12,560
You're interacting with the micro
cosmos that you have in front of you and

165
00:06:12,561 --> 00:06:14,390
learning how to balance chaos and order.

166
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:18,410
There's no difference between you and
what's around you and that's a very

167
00:06:18,411 --> 00:06:21,920
difficult thing to understand and so
you want to act in a way that's good for

168
00:06:21,921 --> 00:06:24,830
you but good for everything else
at the same time and that's,

169
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:29,860
that's a high moral virtue
and that so there is there.

170
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:37,170
That's the right way of thinking about
the relationship between psychological

171
00:06:37,171 --> 00:06:38,850
egoism and altruism.

172
00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:39,990
It's like if you're,

173
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:45,000
as you move towards a broader
conceptualization of things,

174
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:49,140
you start to understand that
there is no selfish selfish,

175
00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:51,510
there is no selfish self interest.

176
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:54,060
It isn't how life works.

177
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:56,400
Like if you're married
to someone for example,

178
00:06:56,401 --> 00:06:58,650
and you're stuck with them
for the next 50 years,

179
00:06:58,651 --> 00:07:00,990
it's like you can't win
an argument with them.

180
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,910
You can make peace because there you man,

181
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:07,133
there you,

182
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:09,120
there are a huge part of your experience.

183
00:07:09,121 --> 00:07:13,140
You have to treat that person as
if they are you and then live.

184
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:13,830
It's not,

185
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:14,401
it isn't like,

186
00:07:14,401 --> 00:07:16,260
well I'm going to treat
you well because you're me.

187
00:07:16,261 --> 00:07:18,360
It's because people don't
treat themselves very well.

188
00:07:18,361 --> 00:07:20,790
Often it's way more complicated than that.

189
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:22,230
You just,

190
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:24,540
you don't want to defeat your wife man,

191
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:27,770
because then you live with a defeated
wife and if you think she isn't going to

192
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:28,591
take revenge on you,

193
00:07:28,591 --> 00:07:29,100
then you're,

194
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:30,210
you're not very bright.

195
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:34,230
So you want to listen to what she has
to say and you want to listen to her

196
00:07:34,231 --> 00:07:38,370
problems and you want to help her solve
them because she's you and you want to

197
00:07:38,371 --> 00:07:41,160
do the same with your kids and then
you want to do the same with the people

198
00:07:41,161 --> 00:07:46,110
around you if you can do it so
and so the whole idea of like,

199
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:46,770
well,

200
00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:48,570
we're basically wired to be selfish.

201
00:07:49,650 --> 00:07:52,800
Well we are when we're not very
wise and we act impulsively.

202
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:56,430
But as your view of the world broadens,

203
00:07:56,431 --> 00:08:00,500
you start to understand that this
is why in the Buddhist philosophy,

204
00:08:00,501 --> 00:08:00,691
you know,

205
00:08:00,691 --> 00:08:02,220
Buddha attain Nirvana.

206
00:08:02,221 --> 00:08:04,740
So that meant he could stay
in union with the gods,

207
00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:05,461
so to speak.

208
00:08:05,461 --> 00:08:05,850
He,

209
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:08,130
he attained the highest form of,

210
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:10,260
of subjective experience,

211
00:08:10,261 --> 00:08:11,094
what might be,

212
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:14,760
which might be something like total
immersion in bliss and meaning.

213
00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:19,560
But he rejected it because he went back
into the world to help other people

214
00:08:19,561 --> 00:08:23,940
attain nirvana or at least to move towards
it because he realized that there was

215
00:08:23,941 --> 00:08:26,940
no individual redemption
without the redemption of all.

216
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:28,530
And you,

217
00:08:28,530 --> 00:08:29,820
if you don't understand that,

218
00:08:29,821 --> 00:08:31,650
then you're just not very wise.

219
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:34,440
And so you're trying to be a
force for good in the world.

220
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,330
And that doesn't mean just good for you.

221
00:08:36,331 --> 00:08:37,164
That's just,

222
00:08:37,290 --> 00:08:42,290
it's just blind because there isn't any
isolated you that isn't how things are

223
00:08:43,471 --> 00:08:45,540
that is now realities lays itself out.

224
00:08:46,170 --> 00:08:46,650
So.
