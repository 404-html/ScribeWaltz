Anonymous says,
how do I deal with the fact that I'm a

2
00:00:09,441 --> 00:00:12,650
pedophile and should I tell my family
and friends it?

3
00:00:13,550 --> 00:00:16,100
Um,
I can't answer the second part of that.

4
00:00:16,130 --> 00:00:19,430
Should I tell my family and friends
because I don't know your family and

5
00:00:19,431 --> 00:00:22,490
friends and I don't know how you would
go about telling them.

6
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:26,300
So I can't make a piece of,
I can't make any advice about that or I

7
00:00:26,301 --> 00:00:28,700
can't offer you any advice about that.
Um,

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,140
I would say that if you have the
opportunity,

9
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:35,450
you should probably go speak to a
counselor or priest or someone that you

10
00:00:35,451 --> 00:00:36,950
trust,
um,

11
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:40,810
because you're going to have to figure
out how to deal with that and,

12
00:00:40,970 --> 00:00:43,850
but you should also maybe,
and that's about the best I can do with

13
00:00:43,851 --> 00:00:45,860
that.
I'm not an expert in the treatment of

14
00:00:45,861 --> 00:00:48,920
pedophilia.
And so I can't offer you any great

15
00:00:48,921 --> 00:00:52,940
clinical wisdom,
but I would say that you need a plan.

16
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:58,010
You need to plan and you have to,
and I would include in that plan the

17
00:00:58,011 --> 00:01:02,750
absolutely catastrophic consequences of
not regulating that behavior properly.

18
00:01:02,751 --> 00:01:07,190
And you should really think it through
because that pedophilic impulse,

19
00:01:07,191 --> 00:01:09,410
let's say,
could lead you into seven different

20
00:01:09,411 --> 00:01:12,410
sorts of hell.
You and whoever you happen to tangle up

21
00:01:12,411 --> 00:01:16,280
in it,
and you might want to avoid severed

22
00:01:16,281 --> 00:01:19,040
diff.
You might want to avoid seven different,

23
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:22,280
seven different forms of hell,
and in order to do that,

24
00:01:22,281 --> 00:01:25,490
given the proclivity that you described,
then you're going to have to have a

25
00:01:25,491 --> 00:01:26,510
plan.
Now,

26
00:01:26,511 --> 00:01:28,790
look,
lots of people have impulses that they

27
00:01:28,791 --> 00:01:30,230
have a hard time controlling.
You know,

28
00:01:30,231 --> 00:01:32,690
alcoholics can't drink alcohol and
cocaine.

29
00:01:32,691 --> 00:01:35,930
Addicts can't take cocaine,
and most people can't.

30
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:39,410
What manifest untrammeled sexual
behavior.

31
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:44,830
And so it certainly within the capacity
of human beings to regulate impulses

32
00:01:46,011 --> 00:01:48,620
that aren't in there or other's best
interests.

33
00:01:48,621 --> 00:01:50,780
So I wouldn't regard it as a hopeless
pursuit,

34
00:01:50,781 --> 00:01:53,840
but it does seem to me that it's
something that you might want to talk to

35
00:01:53,841 --> 00:01:58,841
someone you trust about because it's,
it's a complicated issue and it's a

36
00:02:00,771 --> 00:02:04,850
proclivity that's likely to lead you in
a direction that would be,

37
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,680
let's call it sub optimal.
