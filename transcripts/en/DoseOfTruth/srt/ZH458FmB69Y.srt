1
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:04,380
So this is the idea.

2
00:00:04,381 --> 00:00:05,011
Essentially,

3
00:00:05,011 --> 00:00:09,630
you know that you have the unknown world
that that's just what you don't know at

4
00:00:09,631 --> 00:00:10,140
all.

5
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:10,440
That's,

6
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:11,580
that's the outside,

7
00:00:11,581 --> 00:00:13,530
that's the ocean that
surrounds the island,

8
00:00:13,531 --> 00:00:15,090
that you inhabit something like that.

9
00:00:15,091 --> 00:00:20,091
It's chaos itself and then you act in
that world and you act in ways you don't

10
00:00:20,581 --> 00:00:21,241
understand.

11
00:00:21,241 --> 00:00:22,740
There's more to your actions.

12
00:00:22,741 --> 00:00:23,910
Then you can understand.

13
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:25,380
One of the things young said,

14
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:26,041
I love this.

15
00:00:26,041 --> 00:00:27,150
When I first understood it,

16
00:00:27,151 --> 00:00:27,660
he said,

17
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:29,190
everybody acts out a myth,

18
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:33,150
but very few people know what their myth
is and you should know what your myth

19
00:00:33,151 --> 00:00:37,290
is because it might be a tragedy
and maybe you don't want it to be,

20
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:39,930
and that's really worth
thinking because thinking about,

21
00:00:39,931 --> 00:00:40,650
because you're,

22
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:43,270
you have a pattern of behavior
that characterizes you,

23
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:43,651
you know,

24
00:00:43,651 --> 00:00:45,660
and God only knows where you got it.

25
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:47,280
Partly it's biological,

26
00:00:47,281 --> 00:00:48,610
partly it's from your parents.

27
00:00:48,610 --> 00:00:48,960
It's,

28
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,520
it's your unconscious assumptions.

29
00:00:50,521 --> 00:00:53,640
It's the way the philosophy of your
society is shaped you and it's,

30
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:54,840
it's aimed,

31
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:56,700
it's aiming you somewhere.

32
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:57,601
Well,

33
00:00:57,601 --> 00:00:59,700
is it aiming you somewhere you want to go?

34
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:00,930
That's a good question.

35
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:02,820
That's part of self realization.

36
00:01:02,821 --> 00:01:03,630
You know,

37
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:06,000
we know we don't understand our actions.

38
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:09,630
That's an almost every argument you
have with someone is about that.

39
00:01:09,631 --> 00:01:10,230
It's like,

40
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:13,950
why did you do that and come up with
some half baked reasons why you did it.

41
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:16,050
You're flailing around in the darkness.

42
00:01:16,051 --> 00:01:16,291
You know,

43
00:01:16,291 --> 00:01:18,000
you try to give an account for yourself,

44
00:01:18,001 --> 00:01:19,770
but you can only do it partially.

45
00:01:19,771 --> 00:01:20,161
It's very,

46
00:01:20,161 --> 00:01:23,090
very difficult because you're in your,

47
00:01:23,091 --> 00:01:27,600
you're a complicated animal with the
beginnings of an articulated mind,

48
00:01:27,601 --> 00:01:28,650
something like that,

49
00:01:28,651 --> 00:01:30,840
and you're just way more
than you can handle.
