1
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:07,491
All right,

2
00:00:07,491 --> 00:00:10,460
so you have the chaos that
surrounds you and it's some,

3
00:00:10,461 --> 00:00:11,294
some sense,

4
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:12,770
infinite in scope,

5
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:15,770
and then you have the
order that you produce,

6
00:00:15,771 --> 00:00:18,350
which is your mastery of it.

7
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:18,830
Well,

8
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:20,510
let's take order apart for a minute.

9
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:24,340
We want to think about the
structure of order and bill.

10
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:27,410
And I'm not saying that chaos
is bad in order is good.

11
00:00:27,411 --> 00:00:28,460
I'm not saying that at all.

12
00:00:28,461 --> 00:00:29,990
That's not the right way to look at it.

13
00:00:30,290 --> 00:00:31,123
It's the balance.

14
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:33,920
It's the balance between the
mets of crucial importance.

15
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:34,720
They,

16
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:36,860
they exist as superordinate categories.

17
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:40,700
Whether you liked them or not is
really not that relevant there.

18
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:41,510
There,

19
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:41,990
there,

20
00:00:41,990 --> 00:00:44,780
there the fundamental
constituent elements of reality.

21
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:45,890
Um,

22
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:46,550
you might say,

23
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:46,791
well,

24
00:00:46,791 --> 00:00:48,110
what's your evidence for that?

25
00:00:48,111 --> 00:00:49,850
And I can tell you one piece of evidence,

26
00:00:49,851 --> 00:00:52,640
which I won't go into
for for very much time.

27
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:56,180
You have two hemispheres in each,

28
00:00:56,181 --> 00:00:57,014
in your brain.

29
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,880
The brain is composed of two hemispheres,

30
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:01,790
which implies something about
the nature of the world.

31
00:01:02,690 --> 00:01:05,960
Given that your brain is hypothetically
adapted to the structure of the world.

32
00:01:05,961 --> 00:01:09,860
It's not just your brain cause animal
brains have the same fundamental

33
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:10,851
structure,

34
00:01:10,851 --> 00:01:15,350
this bifurcated structure and the
bifurcation indicates that there's two

35
00:01:15,351 --> 00:01:19,250
fundamental realities because otherwise
why would you need a bifurcated

36
00:01:19,251 --> 00:01:24,050
structure or maybe you need to try you
in brain or one that's divided into four

37
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,340
but that isn't what you have.

38
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:30,410
You have one that's divided into two and
if your working definition of reality

39
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:31,610
is scientific,

40
00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:32,690
biological,

41
00:01:32,691 --> 00:01:33,440
let's say,

42
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:38,240
then your definition of reality is
reality is that which shapes life.

43
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:43,400
You can't actually do better than that
from a Darwinian perspective and if the

44
00:01:43,401 --> 00:01:48,230
reality that shape life produced a
bifurcated representational structure,

45
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:53,390
then that implies that the proper way
to represent reality and perhaps that

46
00:01:53,391 --> 00:01:57,620
reality itself is in fact bifurcated and
I believe it's bifurcated in the manner

47
00:01:57,621 --> 00:02:02,060
I just described and the neurological
evidence for that is actually quite

48
00:02:02,061 --> 00:02:02,894
overwhelming.

49
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,520
It's come from multiple sources,

50
00:02:04,521 --> 00:02:05,510
some of them Russian,

51
00:02:05,511 --> 00:02:06,950
some of them American.

52
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:08,690
That's where most of
the work has been done.

53
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:13,550
Your left hemisphere is specialized for
operation in those situations that you

54
00:02:13,551 --> 00:02:18,230
know and understand and your right
hemisphere is specialized for operation in

55
00:02:18,231 --> 00:02:21,710
those situations that you
neither know nor understand.

56
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:26,960
And the proper way to Orient Yourself
in life is to get the balance between

57
00:02:26,961 --> 00:02:28,640
those two sets of operations.

58
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:29,683
Correct.

59
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:35,030
And the way that manifests itself in
your subjective experiences as meaningful

60
00:02:35,031 --> 00:02:35,864
engagement.

61
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:40,280
And so that's not a bad first pass.

62
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:42,530
What would you say?

63
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:47,830
Justification for the view that these
two domains are the most real domains.

64
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:50,961
Okay,

65
00:02:50,961 --> 00:02:51,830
so order.

66
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:52,963
What is order?

67
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,153
Well,

68
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:57,320
if you just sit there and do nothing,

69
00:02:57,710 --> 00:02:59,090
that will be chaos.

70
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:00,423
Why?

71
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:00,731
Well,

72
00:03:00,731 --> 00:03:01,540
because you'll,

73
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:02,650
you'll suffer and die.

74
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:04,090
That's what will happen.

75
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:07,390
So without action on your part,

76
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:10,510
deterioration and death is a certainty.

77
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:11,591
Okay?

78
00:03:11,591 --> 00:03:15,490
So you need to act well then
we built on an action platform.

79
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:17,670
I mean we're the consequence of

80
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:25,690
3 billion years of evolution for action,

81
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,251
action,

82
00:03:27,251 --> 00:03:32,251
movement forward in the face of
necessity is the prime dictum of life.

83
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,180
That's a good way of thinking about it.

84
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:36,070
Were embodied action.

85
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:39,490
What do you have to do when you act?

86
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:40,390
Well,

87
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:43,090
at minimum you have to do
whatever keeps you able to act.

88
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:44,410
These are truisms,

89
00:03:44,411 --> 00:03:44,710
right?

90
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:45,280
I mean,

91
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,510
you have to have something to eat.

92
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:48,310
You have to have some fresh water.

93
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:49,570
You need some shelter,

94
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:50,351
right?

95
00:03:50,351 --> 00:03:53,740
You need some companionship.

96
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:55,900
You need a sexual partner,

97
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,670
you need children,

98
00:03:57,730 --> 00:03:59,350
you need play.

99
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:00,790
You need to be touched.

100
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:01,683
There's there's,

101
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:02,470
and I mean,

102
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:04,600
I actually mean need by the way.

103
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:07,480
People deprived to play go insane.

104
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:08,920
People who aren't touched,

105
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:09,933
die.

106
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:11,500
These things are necessary.

107
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:11,741
Well,

108
00:04:11,741 --> 00:04:14,020
assuming that survival
itself is necessary,

109
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:15,100
but we'll start with that.

110
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:19,960
We'll start with the assumption that just
sitting there and suffering and dying

111
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:22,090
is not the right solution.

112
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:23,261
Okay?

113
00:04:23,261 --> 00:04:24,760
So you have to act in the world.

114
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:29,890
You have to act in the world that in a
manner that stops you from deteriorating

115
00:04:29,891 --> 00:04:31,300
and dying at minimum.

116
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:36,580
And that means that you have to address
the problems that are intrinsic to that

117
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:37,503
destiny.

118
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:40,090
Now you have all sorts
of systems that evolved,

119
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:41,590
have evolved to help you do that.

120
00:04:41,591 --> 00:04:42,730
Motivational systems,

121
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:43,601
we have to eat.

122
00:04:43,601 --> 00:04:44,500
So you get hungry.

123
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:48,580
You have to find water and
consume it so you get thirsty.

124
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:49,690
You get lonely,

125
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:50,830
you get curious.

126
00:04:50,831 --> 00:04:51,280
There's,

127
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:51,730
there's,

128
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:54,670
there's specialized biological
systems that are very,

129
00:04:54,671 --> 00:04:55,504
very old.

130
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:56,410
You get aggressive,

131
00:04:56,411 --> 00:04:57,400
you get afraid,

132
00:04:57,550 --> 00:04:57,850
you,

133
00:04:57,850 --> 00:04:58,900
you suffer pain,

134
00:04:59,070 --> 00:04:59,520
all those,

135
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:04,030
there's specialized systems for all
of those unit directional systems of

136
00:05:04,031 --> 00:05:05,230
orientation in the world.

137
00:05:05,231 --> 00:05:06,820
And they help you figure out what to do.

138
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:07,780
So when you're hungry,

139
00:05:07,781 --> 00:05:08,471
it's time to eat.

140
00:05:08,471 --> 00:05:09,500
And when you're thirsty it's,

141
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:10,420
it's time to drink.

142
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:11,280
And when your lonesome,

143
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:13,510
it's time to seek out some companionship.

144
00:05:13,511 --> 00:05:16,960
And you have specialized
systems that help you do that.

145
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,670
But they're not enough because,

146
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:19,931
well,

147
00:05:19,931 --> 00:05:20,860
they're not very bright.

148
00:05:20,861 --> 00:05:22,090
That's one way of looking at it.

149
00:05:22,091 --> 00:05:25,540
They're kind of uni dimensional and you
also have the problem of organizing all

150
00:05:25,541 --> 00:05:25,841
of them.

151
00:05:25,841 --> 00:05:26,171
It's like,

152
00:05:26,171 --> 00:05:26,291
well,

153
00:05:26,291 --> 00:05:29,380
you have to eat now and you have to
drink now and you need a companion.

154
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:32,650
It's probably time to play and you
have to do something about shelter.

155
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:34,210
And there isn't just you right now.

156
00:05:34,211 --> 00:05:38,470
There's you now and tomorrow and next
week and a year from now and five years

157
00:05:38,471 --> 00:05:38,831
from now.

158
00:05:38,831 --> 00:05:43,330
So you have to plan across all those
stretches of time and there isn't just you

159
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,320
now in the future,

160
00:05:44,321 --> 00:05:44,591
you,

161
00:05:44,591 --> 00:05:48,790
there's you plus your family and your
community and so all of that has to be

162
00:05:48,791 --> 00:05:53,260
taken into account while you're
plotting your movement forward is very,

163
00:05:53,261 --> 00:05:54,070
very complicated.

164
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:56,050
You have all these
problems to solve simile,

165
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:58,670
tiniest [inaudible] and
your motivational systems,

166
00:05:58,671 --> 00:05:59,151
anger,

167
00:05:59,151 --> 00:06:03,410
hunger and so forth can help you
solve one of those problems now,

168
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:05,960
but not all of them permanently.

169
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:10,190
That requires higher cognitive function
and that's part of what drove the

170
00:06:10,191 --> 00:06:13,220
evolution of our complex
cognitive systems.

171
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:17,270
That's how do you propagate the game
across time in a complex environment.

172
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:21,350
The left hemisphere operates when,

173
00:06:21,351 --> 00:06:21,770
where,

174
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:26,770
when what you're doing works and so a
lot of what you do during your life is to

175
00:06:26,781 --> 00:06:29,000
keep your right hemisphere off.

176
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,390
People don't like it
going on accidentally.

177
00:06:32,391 --> 00:06:34,100
It's the home of negative emotion.

178
00:06:34,101 --> 00:06:36,440
It's the home of pain and anxiety.

179
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:40,280
It's the thing that turns on and freezes
you in your tracks when something that

180
00:06:40,281 --> 00:06:45,281
you deeply did not expect happens and it
prepares you to deal with the onslaught

181
00:06:45,321 --> 00:06:46,550
of what you didn't expect.

182
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:52,630
Now it's not all bad news because to
use the right hemisphere in a judicious

183
00:06:53,241 --> 00:06:57,920
manner is also something that
adds intrigue and interest
in artistic expression

184
00:06:57,921 --> 00:07:00,320
and all sorts of positive
things to your life.

185
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:04,010
So because potential is not only negative,

186
00:07:04,011 --> 00:07:05,060
it's also positive,

187
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:05,930
it can be,

188
00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:10,730
it can be dealt with in ways that
are deeply enriching and meaningful

189
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:13,063
order.

190
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:13,461
Okay,

191
00:07:13,461 --> 00:07:14,840
so you have to do something.

192
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,140
Otherwise the consequences are dire.

193
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:21,500
To do something you
have to value something.

194
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:22,680
It's it's,

195
00:07:22,690 --> 00:07:27,690
it's a definitional issue because to do
something is to act out the proposition

196
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,270
that the thing you're doing,

197
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:30,410
the thing you're aiming at,

198
00:07:30,411 --> 00:07:34,820
let's say it's preferable to the thing
you have and preferable means you'll do

199
00:07:34,821 --> 00:07:35,090
it.

200
00:07:35,090 --> 00:07:36,830
So those things are tied
together so tightly.

201
00:07:36,831 --> 00:07:38,720
You can't disentangle them.

202
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:40,093
If you say,

203
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:41,960
I'm aiming at x,

204
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:43,280
but I don't value it,

205
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:46,490
then there's something wrong with the
way that you're conceptualizing the

206
00:07:46,491 --> 00:07:47,324
statement.

207
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:52,490
Because to aim at something and to work
to bring it into existence is the same

208
00:07:52,491 --> 00:07:53,324
as valuing it.

209
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:54,261
And if you say,

210
00:07:54,261 --> 00:07:54,471
well,

211
00:07:54,471 --> 00:07:55,310
I don't value it,

212
00:07:55,311 --> 00:07:56,780
then something's out of kilter.

213
00:07:57,110 --> 00:08:00,920
Either you're acting out a false hood
or you don't know what you're talking

214
00:08:00,921 --> 00:08:01,370
about.

215
00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:04,970
It's one of those two things and you
meet people like that are deeply confused

216
00:08:04,971 --> 00:08:05,400
there.

217
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:10,400
Their action patterns and their
verbal self representation don't Mesh,

218
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:14,570
but that doesn't mean that
they're critics of value.

219
00:08:14,571 --> 00:08:16,910
It just means that
they're deeply confused.

220
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:20,270
So you have to act or you suffer.

221
00:08:20,271 --> 00:08:21,110
In order to act,

222
00:08:21,111 --> 00:08:25,040
you have to have a value structure
because to act you have to value one thing

223
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:25,940
more than another,

224
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:29,750
which means that you have to
inhabit a structure of value.

225
00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:31,123
You have to,

226
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:32,863
okay,

227
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:38,080
so you need a structure value because
it's the antidote to catastrophe.

228
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:40,393
Now,

229
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,640
if you act out a structure
of values socially,

230
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:45,560
which you will cause you're social,

231
00:08:45,770 --> 00:08:49,970
you're not going to pursue your aims
in isolation because you're not,

232
00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:52,910
you're not a solitary animal.

233
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:54,530
You're a social animal,

234
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:56,190
you're a tribal animal.

235
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:58,140
Deeply tribal.

236
00:08:58,530 --> 00:08:59,550
We live in groups,

237
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:00,840
we live in families,

238
00:09:00,841 --> 00:09:01,920
we live in communities.

239
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:07,100
We live in large societies were social
at every level of analysis and we've been

240
00:09:07,591 --> 00:09:11,520
social for as long as we've been primates.

241
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:13,230
So maybe that's,

242
00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:17,940
that's at least 6 million years and it
might be more like 60 million years.

243
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:20,070
It's really a long time.

244
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:23,730
So it's not an arbitrary
social construction.

245
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:24,751
It's far,

246
00:09:24,751 --> 00:09:25,860
far deeper than that.

247
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:30,720
Now what happens when you
act out a structure of value
in a social environment,

248
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:35,400
you produce a hierarchy inevitably.

249
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:36,491
Well,

250
00:09:36,491 --> 00:09:37,410
let's think it through.

251
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:38,453
Why?

252
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:39,301
Well,

253
00:09:39,301 --> 00:09:43,020
let's say that you say that one thing
is more worth doing then another,

254
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:44,820
whatever happens to be,

255
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:48,360
and then you tell a bunch of people about
what you're doing and they decide that

256
00:09:48,361 --> 00:09:51,180
they're going to come along and help you
do this thing that's valuable because

257
00:09:51,181 --> 00:09:55,650
they also think it's valuable and maybe
you get 20 people together to do this

258
00:09:55,651 --> 00:09:56,160
thing,

259
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,420
whatever it happens to me.

260
00:09:57,780 --> 00:10:00,900
And the first thing you discover is that
some of the people are way better at

261
00:10:00,901 --> 00:10:03,150
doing whatever it is that
they're doing than other people.

262
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:04,980
So,

263
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:05,550
and that,

264
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:06,660
and who knows why that is?

265
00:10:06,661 --> 00:10:08,520
Because it depends on
what you chose to do,

266
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:08,911
you know?

267
00:10:08,911 --> 00:10:09,691
If you chose a,

268
00:10:09,691 --> 00:10:13,260
then it would be a different group
of people who were good at it.

269
00:10:13,261 --> 00:10:14,460
Then if you chose B,

270
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:16,290
because people differ in their abilities.

271
00:10:16,291 --> 00:10:20,730
But one thing you will not escape
from if you make an organization to do

272
00:10:20,731 --> 00:10:25,731
something valuable is the brute fact
that it will be a minority of the people

273
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:27,510
who are good at doing it.

274
00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:29,520
And there's actually a law,

275
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:31,170
it's called price's law,

276
00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:33,180
and it's a real law,

277
00:10:33,450 --> 00:10:38,450
even governs the size of cities and the
massive stars in the heights of plants

278
00:10:38,791 --> 00:10:39,570
in the jungle.

279
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:42,060
It just doesn't govern human interactions.

280
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:46,380
And price's law says that the square root
of the number of people engaged in an

281
00:10:46,381 --> 00:10:46,921
enterprise,

282
00:10:46,921 --> 00:10:48,030
we'll do half the work.

283
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,000
So if you have 10 people doing something,

284
00:10:51,001 --> 00:10:51,451
three of them,

285
00:10:51,451 --> 00:10:52,350
we'll do half the work.

286
00:10:52,530 --> 00:10:54,330
But if you have a hundred
people doing something,

287
00:10:54,331 --> 00:10:56,070
then 10 of them will do half the work.

288
00:10:56,850 --> 00:11:00,180
And if you have 10,000 people doing
something than a hundred of them,

289
00:11:00,181 --> 00:11:01,260
we'll do half the work.

290
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:02,730
And the,

291
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:07,590
you know how wealth distributes itself
such that a minority of people have most

292
00:11:07,591 --> 00:11:08,424
of the money,

293
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:12,300
1285 richest people in the world
have as much money as the bottom,

294
00:11:12,301 --> 00:11:13,320
two and a half billion.

295
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:14,550
It's something like that.

296
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:15,570
And everybody goes,

297
00:11:15,571 --> 00:11:16,404
oh my God,

298
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,270
the 1% it's like,

299
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:18,631
well,

300
00:11:18,631 --> 00:11:19,141
first of all,

301
00:11:19,141 --> 00:11:22,710
you're all the 1% so get
over yourself because you're,

302
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:23,693
you know,

303
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:24,990
western European,

304
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:29,640
roughly speaking and by world
current world standards,

305
00:11:29,641 --> 00:11:31,530
and certainly by historical standards,

306
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:35,850
you're all well ensconced in
the 1% so if that's a problem,

307
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:38,760
well it's a problem for all of you.

308
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:40,080
And some of you might be,

309
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:40,800
you know,

310
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:41,790
richer than that,

311
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:44,730
but that doesn't mean all of
you aren't in the same boat.

312
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:45,653
Fundamentally,

313
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:51,060
the fact that wealth aggregates in the
hands of a small number of people is part

314
00:11:51,061 --> 00:11:53,040
of the general expression of price's.

315
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:56,170
There's nothing special about
the distribution of money.

316
00:11:56,410 --> 00:11:58,840
You see the same thing
in every creative domain.

317
00:11:59,500 --> 00:11:59,681
I mean,

318
00:11:59,681 --> 00:12:02,170
how many of you have have recorded a

319
00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:04,840
gold record?

320
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:10,000
How many looks like zero up?

321
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:10,780
There's one,

322
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:11,620
one person,

323
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:12,131
okay,

324
00:12:12,131 --> 00:12:13,780
there's 850 people in here.

325
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:17,650
So there's one in a thousand so that's
one 10th of 1% something like that.

326
00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:20,470
How many of you have
written a piano concerto?

327
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:27,490
How about painted a painting that's
hanging in a national museum?

328
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:29,231
Oh look,

329
00:12:29,231 --> 00:12:30,310
it's none of you again.

330
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:31,450
Right?

331
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:31,751
Well,

332
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:35,020
and how many of you have been a
member of a professional sports team?

333
00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:36,911
Okay,

334
00:12:36,911 --> 00:12:38,440
look up one one.

335
00:12:38,441 --> 00:12:39,640
So that's one in a thousand.

336
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:41,200
Well you get the point here.

337
00:12:41,370 --> 00:12:42,161
Well if there was a couple,

338
00:12:42,161 --> 00:12:42,490
there was.

339
00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:42,791
Okay,

340
00:12:42,791 --> 00:12:46,570
so it looks like it's easier to be a
member of a professional sports team

341
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:50,950
or my or my audiences is biased.

342
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:52,780
The samples biased but,

343
00:12:53,290 --> 00:12:54,101
but it is the case.

344
00:12:54,101 --> 00:12:57,730
If you look at high levels of creative
achievement of the sort of just described

345
00:12:58,060 --> 00:12:58,570
they can,

346
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:01,540
they characterize it
staggering minority of people.

347
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:06,990
And so the rule is is that you produce
a value system which you better produce

348
00:13:08,081 --> 00:13:10,180
because otherwise you suffer and die.

349
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,291
And it isn't the only,

350
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:12,520
the only that it's like,

351
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:13,120
look,

352
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,530
here's something else you all know.

353
00:13:14,890 --> 00:13:15,910
As far as I can tell,

354
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:21,040
we start with the idea
that there's an intrinsic,

355
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:26,110
chaotic element to life and that includes
the inevitability of suffering and

356
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:29,380
malevolence betrayal at the hands
of yourself and other people.

357
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,450
So that's the baseline.

358
00:13:31,451 --> 00:13:35,590
And that's intolerable in many ways
because life is in many ways intolerable.

359
00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:36,701
And the question is,

360
00:13:36,701 --> 00:13:36,821
well,

361
00:13:36,821 --> 00:13:39,070
what do you do in the face of
something that's intolerable?

362
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:39,990
And answer is,

363
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:42,070
will you try to find something
that justifies it right?

364
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:46,600
You want to have something that gets you
the hell out of bed in the morning and

365
00:13:46,601 --> 00:13:48,220
not just any old morning,

366
00:13:48,221 --> 00:13:52,720
but a morning when your
father has Alzheimer's disease
and your daughter has an

367
00:13:52,721 --> 00:13:56,380
incurable illness because you need
something to get out of bed for in those

368
00:13:56,381 --> 00:13:57,280
mornings too.

369
00:13:57,700 --> 00:14:00,640
And that better be the purpose
that you found in life.

370
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:04,450
And if the purpose is going to be such
that it gets you out of bed in those

371
00:14:04,451 --> 00:14:04,960
mornings,

372
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:08,620
it better be a pretty damn
noble purpose because otherwise,

373
00:14:08,621 --> 00:14:09,880
why would you bother?

374
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:12,430
And so not only do you
need a value structure,

375
00:14:12,431 --> 00:14:16,300
you need one that's of sufficient tension,

376
00:14:16,301 --> 00:14:17,134
let's say,

377
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:22,200
or sufficient value or sufficient
nobility so that it's worth suffering for

378
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:26,350
because you're going to suffer and you
better have something that makes the

379
00:14:26,351 --> 00:14:27,820
suffering justifiable.
