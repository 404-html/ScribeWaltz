1
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:07,730
All right,

2
00:00:07,730 --> 00:00:10,120
so here's the way of
thinking about things.

3
00:00:10,121 --> 00:00:11,980
I'm going to move through
it relatively quickly.

4
00:00:11,981 --> 00:00:12,760
So,

5
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:13,390
um,

6
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:14,710
you look through the world,

7
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:17,920
you look at the world through a frame of
reference and the reason you do that in

8
00:00:17,921 --> 00:00:20,530
part is because there's more to
the world than you can understand.

9
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,200
And so that would be the
actual chaos of the world.

10
00:00:23,201 --> 00:00:24,730
It's like the world is very,

11
00:00:24,731 --> 00:00:25,061
very,

12
00:00:25,061 --> 00:00:25,451
very,

13
00:00:25,451 --> 00:00:25,841
very,

14
00:00:25,841 --> 00:00:27,010
very complicated.

15
00:00:27,011 --> 00:00:29,170
And you know you're a
very complicated too,

16
00:00:29,171 --> 00:00:31,030
but you're not as
complicated as the world.

17
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:34,630
So you're continually surrounded by a
chaotic structure that you don't really

18
00:00:34,631 --> 00:00:39,370
understand and you have to frame it
in with a frame of reference that only

19
00:00:39,371 --> 00:00:43,990
allows you to see those things that are
necessary for you to see at the time of

20
00:00:43,991 --> 00:00:44,890
your given action.

21
00:00:44,891 --> 00:00:45,940
And as far as I can tell,

22
00:00:45,941 --> 00:00:47,860
this is a cybernetic model of personality.

23
00:00:48,190 --> 00:00:52,060
The elements of that frame or
something like this is a basic story.

24
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:53,710
You are somewhere,

25
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:56,740
you're located somewhere
in time and space always.

26
00:00:56,741 --> 00:01:00,460
You know where that is and you have
some sense of the qualities of that

27
00:01:00,461 --> 00:01:01,294
localization.

28
00:01:01,630 --> 00:01:04,300
So people ask you about
that because they ask you,

29
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:04,541
well,

30
00:01:04,541 --> 00:01:05,530
how are you doing?

31
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:07,120
And what they're asking is,

32
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:07,900
you know,

33
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:10,630
what's your representation of
your current state of being?

34
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:13,930
And the answer to that
is generally for people.

35
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:14,620
Um,

36
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:15,161
it's okay,

37
00:01:15,161 --> 00:01:18,280
but it's insufficient because
if it wasn't insufficient,

38
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:19,120
while what,

39
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:19,450
why,

40
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:20,590
why would you be doing anything?

41
00:01:20,591 --> 00:01:25,450
And then he in principle now isn't good
enough because there's something else

42
00:01:25,451 --> 00:01:26,290
that could be better.

43
00:01:26,291 --> 00:01:27,400
And that's what you're pursuing.

44
00:01:27,401 --> 00:01:29,200
And if it's kind of a weird thing,

45
00:01:29,201 --> 00:01:34,120
because it means in some sense that if
you weren't dissatisfied permanently,

46
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:36,370
you wouldn't be motivated to do anything.

47
00:01:36,371 --> 00:01:40,880
And so that's also part of the reason
that a lot of human being human experience

48
00:01:40,881 --> 00:01:43,330
is characterized by
somewhat negative emotions.

49
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:44,050
It's like this,

50
00:01:44,050 --> 00:01:45,580
we're permanently dissatisfied.

51
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:46,773
Why?

52
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:47,321
Well,

53
00:01:47,321 --> 00:01:49,150
because we can act to change things.

54
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:51,430
So if you're not dissatisfied,

55
00:01:51,431 --> 00:01:52,450
you don't want it to be better.

56
00:01:52,451 --> 00:01:53,440
So in some sense,

57
00:01:53,441 --> 00:01:56,080
what you're doing is looking at the
world through a frame that says,

58
00:01:56,081 --> 00:02:01,030
this is what there is and here's how
I evaluated and here's what could be.

59
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,260
And that's what I want.

60
00:02:02,261 --> 00:02:04,090
I would like to bring that about.

61
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:04,991
And so that's,

62
00:02:04,991 --> 00:02:05,470
uh,

63
00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:07,180
that's what gives things value.

64
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:11,320
It gives things value because things that
will move you to where you want to go,

65
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:15,100
they have a positive value and things
that get in your way when you're trying to

66
00:02:15,101 --> 00:02:16,150
get to where you want to go,

67
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:17,470
they have a negative value.

68
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:19,780
And so that's partly
how your emotions work.

69
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:20,610
So,

70
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:22,270
and you can put almost anything in the,

71
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:24,010
in the box of what should be.
