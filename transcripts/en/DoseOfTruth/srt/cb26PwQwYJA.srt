1
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:11,960
Last question is since it
is the holiday season now,

2
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:16,760
and hopefully young people will be
inspired to read a bit over the break,

3
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:18,230
what book?

4
00:00:18,290 --> 00:00:21,360
Give me two books that you can
recommend to the high school.

5
00:00:21,361 --> 00:00:21,621
There's that.

6
00:00:21,621 --> 00:00:22,454
We'll be like,

7
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:22,890
okay,

8
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:27,890
well I would say high school did a really
good book is as Viktor Frankl's man's

9
00:00:28,881 --> 00:00:29,714
search for meaning.

10
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:31,690
It's a very deep book and it's,

11
00:00:31,691 --> 00:00:32,240
it's,

12
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:36,320
I would say it's an accessible book
and it's very thoughtful and so I think

13
00:00:36,321 --> 00:00:37,280
that's a great one.

14
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:42,880
I think that it's salutary for young
people to read 1984 and brave new world as

15
00:00:44,031 --> 00:00:44,490
well.

16
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:47,030
I don't know if those are still
on high school reading lists,

17
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:50,930
but they certainly should be because
they lay out two different totalitarian

18
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:51,920
futures,

19
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,630
both of which are quite,

20
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:55,130
not only quite plausible,

21
00:00:55,131 --> 00:00:57,860
but pieces of which you can
see already in operation.

22
00:00:58,420 --> 00:00:59,253
Um,

23
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:00,321
but man,

24
00:01:00,321 --> 00:01:01,011
search for meaning,

25
00:01:01,011 --> 00:01:01,730
I really like,

26
00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:06,170
there's one by Carl you'll to called
modern man in search of a soul,

27
00:01:06,171 --> 00:01:09,470
which I think is another one that would
be good for high school kids to read.

28
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:11,750
It's as far as Carl Jung's writings go.

29
00:01:11,751 --> 00:01:13,220
It's pretty accessible and it's,

30
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:15,110
it also speaks to the,

31
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:20,920
what would you say to the high value and
potential integrity of the human psyche

32
00:01:21,561 --> 00:01:22,430
and soul and,

33
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:25,520
and the importance for individuals,

34
00:01:25,521 --> 00:01:29,000
including high school cause students to
get their acts together and to figure

35
00:01:29,001 --> 00:01:31,490
out how to organize themselves
and to contribute to the world.

36
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:33,740
So that's what I would recommend.

37
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:34,970
Great choices.

38
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,590
I love all the books you just mentioned.

39
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:39,470
And so this is going to be your
first Christmas as a grandfather.

40
00:01:39,471 --> 00:01:40,304
Excited.

41
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:41,010
Oh,

42
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:41,751
it's pretty nice.

43
00:01:41,751 --> 00:01:42,081
Yeah.

44
00:01:42,081 --> 00:01:47,081
I mean we're going to have
three Christmases because
my kids each have their own

45
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:50,630
household established in Toronto and so
we're going to have a Christmas at each

46
00:01:50,631 --> 00:01:50,931
of them.

47
00:01:50,931 --> 00:01:54,830
So that's where you're going to be
eating a lot of Turkey basically.

48
00:01:54,831 --> 00:01:55,121
Yeah,

49
00:01:55,121 --> 00:01:55,371
yeah,

50
00:01:55,371 --> 00:01:55,660
it was her.

51
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:56,361
That's amazing.

52
00:01:56,361 --> 00:01:56,501
I'm,

53
00:01:56,501 --> 00:01:56,850
I'm,

54
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:57,651
I'm and it's,

55
00:01:57,651 --> 00:01:57,891
yeah,

56
00:01:57,891 --> 00:02:01,070
it's really fun to have a baby around
again and to watch her watch her develop.

57
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:04,790
You've got to the point now where she
can hold a rattle and she's experimenting

58
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:06,210
with a bunch of new sounds and,

59
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,140
and smiles quite a lot.

60
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:10,490
Makes eye contact and
it's discovered her feet.

61
00:02:10,491 --> 00:02:11,170
And,

62
00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:11,960
um,

63
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:12,171
yeah,

64
00:02:12,171 --> 00:02:13,004
it's really fun.

65
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:14,810
It's remarkable watching them grow.

66
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:16,610
So lastly,

67
00:02:16,611 --> 00:02:18,290
what's your New Year's resolution?

68
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:19,430
Or have you made any,

69
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,070
or do you make them Oh yeah,

70
00:02:22,071 --> 00:02:22,461
I make,

71
00:02:22,461 --> 00:02:22,971
I do.

72
00:02:22,971 --> 00:02:23,900
I would say I do.

73
00:02:23,901 --> 00:02:24,441
I mean,

74
00:02:24,441 --> 00:02:26,030
I make resolution to all the time.

75
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:26,920
Um.
