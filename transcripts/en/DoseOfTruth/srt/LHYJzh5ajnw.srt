1
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,340
You have real life

2
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:22,530
first order abstractions.

3
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:25,600
If someone's telling you the story

4
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:30,880
because they're going to tell you

5
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:37,930
what's the difference between what's
relevant and what is it rather,

6
00:00:39,310 --> 00:00:40,280
why.

7
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:43,930
You just know when that happens,

8
00:00:43,931 --> 00:00:45,820
you know that the person
is good at telling a story.

9
00:00:45,821 --> 00:00:49,570
So what they're essentially
doing is they're laying
down your experience but not

10
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:54,010
there's select group about and
that's what needs a boring story.

11
00:00:54,550 --> 00:00:55,700
They do first order,

12
00:00:56,630 --> 00:00:59,320
first order the fictionalization
in some sense they say,

13
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:02,650
well here's a bunch of interesting
things that happened last week and it was

14
00:01:02,651 --> 00:01:03,131
interesting.

15
00:01:03,131 --> 00:01:06,990
Things have to have some dairies when
your body in some way or you're not going

16
00:01:06,991 --> 00:01:08,850
to find them interesting and have a,

17
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:12,220
you have to know to extract
something of value at that point,

18
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:15,030
a point of wind direction
if his suffering.

19
00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:16,340
So that's what makes you,

20
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:17,830
it's an interesting and
then you might think,

21
00:01:17,831 --> 00:01:19,500
well that's just the boring story coming.

22
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:23,830
But then you have people who are
brilliant yet say writing novels or we're

23
00:01:23,831 --> 00:01:24,670
producing movies,

24
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:25,330
screenplays,

25
00:01:25,330 --> 00:01:29,310
and they're way better than a normal
person that extracting what's important,

26
00:01:29,311 --> 00:01:30,580
like the geniuses at it.

27
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,760
And so they don't just
extract that from their life.

28
00:01:33,790 --> 00:01:34,600
What's relevant?

29
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:35,051
Interesting.

30
00:01:35,051 --> 00:01:38,890
They look at a whole bunch of people and
then how did distilled it into a single

31
00:01:38,891 --> 00:01:42,570
characters and then they extract out
from them what's relevant and interesting

32
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:45,350
and they lay on this portrayal,

33
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:48,070
good versus evil and transformation.

34
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:49,660
It's transfixing.

35
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:53,260
That's what we do.

36
00:01:53,261 --> 00:01:56,890
We with her religious stories
since the beginning of time,

37
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:00,730
we'd be watching how we may hate.

38
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:06,090
We've been extracting the patterns of
that application and we'd been presented

39
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:10,910
in dramatic form and those stories
are at the bottom of cognitive.

40
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:11,793
Our church.

41
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:13,040
That's what are,

42
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:14,140
it's,

43
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:18,940
it's within that structure that our
world views rest and that is roughly

44
00:02:18,941 --> 00:02:19,511
speaking,

45
00:02:19,511 --> 00:02:20,710
it's the dreamer.

46
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:24,610
Good versus evil on the
landscape of chaos versus order.

47
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:28,630
Order be that place that you're
familiar with and comfortable with.

48
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:29,450
The home,

49
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:30,020
the heart,

50
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:30,581
the family,

51
00:02:30,581 --> 00:02:31,414
that country,

52
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:32,253
the state,

53
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:33,850
the well organized community,

54
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:35,410
the [inaudible] community,

55
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,700
the world's city,

56
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:38,520
the places that people have always lived.

57
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:40,660
And then what's the upside of that?

58
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:42,040
And that's our reality.

59
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:43,780
That's the landscape.

60
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,471
Within math,

61
00:02:44,471 --> 00:02:48,580
there's a drama group versus evil
and that's our fundamental religious

62
00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:50,050
conception of the world.

63
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:50,921
And you might take,

64
00:02:50,921 --> 00:02:52,660
well you don't believe in that,

65
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:54,220
but that's not true.

66
00:02:54,730 --> 00:02:56,950
You do believe in that because
if you didn't believe it,

67
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:58,210
you wouldn't be human.

68
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:01,660
Because to human is to live in that world,

69
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:05,060
metaphysically is very
difficult to say it.

70
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:10,120
This is reality actually chaos versus
order with the drum out of good and evil

71
00:03:11,051 --> 00:03:12,350
being played down at that.

72
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:14,380
And that's a very difficult
question to answer,

73
00:03:14,381 --> 00:03:19,270
but one thing I can tell you is that
you act like it is and your brain is

74
00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:23,860
organized like idiots and so that's
pretty powerful evidence that there's

75
00:03:23,861 --> 00:03:27,670
something going on that's vaguely
related to reality and not just to

76
00:03:27,671 --> 00:03:28,504
imagination.

77
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:31,533
Okay.

78
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:41,410
I'm going to tell you if you're a
sequence of very old stories and then I'm

79
00:03:41,411 --> 00:03:42,700
going to tell you about Ypo,

80
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:47,730
related to mass murderers
because I already said that
if you want to answer the

81
00:03:48,641 --> 00:03:49,780
most difficult question,

82
00:03:49,781 --> 00:03:54,460
you have to go with the deepest possible
level and the deepest possible level

83
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:55,930
isn't what you know.

84
00:03:55,931 --> 00:03:58,870
You know it's what you act out.

85
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:01,870
And maybe it's what
you start to represent,

86
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:03,550
but you don't know what it is yet.

87
00:04:03,551 --> 00:04:08,551
It's too profound once to Bizible
in some sense to be part of a fully

88
00:04:08,651 --> 00:04:09,700
articulating knowledge.

89
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:13,690
One of the things that see wonderful
things that cardio was attempted to do,

90
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:17,500
I think he was,

91
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:20,320
I don't know if he was the greatest
thinker of the 20th century,

92
00:04:20,321 --> 00:04:21,310
but he certainly,

93
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:27,120
he was certainly up there and I'll tell
you what he was up when he took Freud's

94
00:04:28,061 --> 00:04:33,061
idea that you could look at fantasy
and extract out new knowledge,

95
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:35,800
that idea seriously and then you thought,

96
00:04:35,801 --> 00:04:38,350
well dreams that people
have in your fantasies,

97
00:04:38,351 --> 00:04:41,450
they have our length of mythologies
that they use in their culture.

98
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:43,600
So the dream is to be individual,

99
00:04:43,601 --> 00:04:47,800
like the myth is to the culture and
you'll believe that we existed within

100
00:04:47,801 --> 00:04:48,970
Stuart's if we'd been,

101
00:04:48,971 --> 00:04:49,804
I've described it.

102
00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:51,610
I think the evidence for that by the way,

103
00:04:51,611 --> 00:04:52,680
is in controvert.

104
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:57,750
I think Kenny serious psychologist
who knows anything about how the brain

105
00:04:58,751 --> 00:05:03,751
functions in any deep sense is to admit
that the manner in which we construct

106
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:07,890
the world looks like in heritage now.

107
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:09,260
And not everyone agrees with that,

108
00:05:09,290 --> 00:05:13,560
but the psychologist that I've come
across who I think are the deepest of the

109
00:05:13,561 --> 00:05:18,561
thinkers have drawn that conclusion and
widely disparate fields ranging from

110
00:05:19,091 --> 00:05:21,920
artificial intelligence
to the analysis of dreams.

111
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:24,700
It's something that's emerged across this.

112
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:33,870
So here's where it was up.

113
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:38,970
The first day he paused what I just
told you about this extension of Freud's

114
00:05:41,890 --> 00:05:42,790
vision of treats.

115
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:48,400
The second I think there was that are
the way they think about the world is

116
00:05:48,401 --> 00:05:49,810
advantage stories.

117
00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:58,170
Third idea was that the stories were
deeply of who we are and I'm only

118
00:05:59,391 --> 00:06:04,391
culturally but in the deepest possible
biological sense wasn't the mirror

119
00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:06,500
armature,

120
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:08,260
socio cultural construction.

121
00:06:08,530 --> 00:06:12,760
And I also think the evidence for that
just overwhelming and crystal court,

122
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,150
first of all,

123
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:19,840
our fundamental biology is very much
like that of the fundamental biology of

124
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:20,810
animals,

125
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:21,261
mammals,

126
00:06:21,261 --> 00:06:22,100
social mammals,

127
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:24,110
the drugs that work on us,

128
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:25,450
the site,

129
00:06:25,450 --> 00:06:26,141
the drugs that work.

130
00:06:26,141 --> 00:06:26,740
Psychologically,

131
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:29,930
I'll have to have very similar effects
on animals like rats for example.

132
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:34,310
We share biological history with animals

133
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:41,060
and to think about us as some of them
divorced from our biological fundamental

134
00:06:41,871 --> 00:06:43,590
is loosely,

135
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:45,830
you know that you know,

136
00:06:45,831 --> 00:06:48,920
that might what you don't have to
talk about when you talk to someone,

137
00:06:48,921 --> 00:06:51,050
you don't have to talk
about what anger is.

138
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:52,930
You don't have to talk
about what theories.

139
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:54,620
You don't have to talk
about what jealousy is.

140
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:58,430
You don't have to talk about what
Hungary's like describe your particular

141
00:06:58,431 --> 00:06:58,671
hunger,

142
00:06:58,671 --> 00:07:02,270
but you don't have to make a
case for the existence of hunger,

143
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:02,930
right?

144
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:07,010
There's all these fundamental human
experiences that are part and parcel of

145
00:07:07,011 --> 00:07:11,330
being embodied in the manner that we're
embodied that are beyond discussion

146
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:11,631
there.

147
00:07:11,631 --> 00:07:14,540
So self-evident pain is one you don't,

148
00:07:14,690 --> 00:07:19,690
you don't have to convince someone else
of the existence of pain or suffering.

149
00:07:20,471 --> 00:07:23,270
I could particularly
alcohol in that regard.

150
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:26,990
And so we have those fundamental ways
of orienting ourselves to the world that

151
00:07:26,991 --> 00:07:28,360
are deeply rooted biologically.

152
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:31,850
They manifest themselves in our stories
and that makes up part of our nature.

153
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:35,840
And we have to figure out how to cope
with those fundamental realities of life.

154
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:40,780
And the way we do that is by learning to
act in particular ways in the world are

155
00:07:40,781 --> 00:07:40,971
there.

156
00:07:40,971 --> 00:07:42,050
You can strange ways.
