1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:03,930
One of the things that happens to people
all the time in their life is they get

2
00:00:03,931 --> 00:00:06,810
to where they're going and then
they don't know what to do,

3
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:07,171
right?

4
00:00:07,171 --> 00:00:08,310
So for example,

5
00:00:08,311 --> 00:00:09,780
you graduate from university,

6
00:00:09,781 --> 00:00:10,111
it's like,

7
00:00:10,111 --> 00:00:10,944
okay,

8
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:12,600
story over.

9
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:14,190
Who are you now?

10
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:16,440
Who are you the next day?

11
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:17,890
And so,

12
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:19,770
so what happens is when you succeed,

13
00:00:19,771 --> 00:00:23,580
then there's a success crisis
and the success crisis as well.

14
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:26,910
I've run this story to its end now what?

15
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:30,150
And that's exactly what happens
in the Abrahamic stories.

16
00:00:30,151 --> 00:00:34,770
And there are punctuated by a period
of contemplation and sacrifice.

17
00:00:34,771 --> 00:00:37,890
So every time an Abrahamic
story comes to its end,

18
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:42,960
then Abraham makes another
sacrifice and communes with God,

19
00:00:42,961 --> 00:00:44,520
and then he figures out what to do next.

20
00:00:44,521 --> 00:00:45,354
And that seems,

21
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:46,620
that seems right.

22
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:48,720
It seems psychologically right?

23
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:51,540
Because what you should do when
your story comes to an end,

24
00:00:51,541 --> 00:00:53,640
when you've achieved what it
is that you want to achieve,

25
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:56,130
or perhaps when you're in
terribly dire straights,

26
00:00:56,131 --> 00:00:58,020
but we won't talk about
that at the moment.

27
00:00:58,290 --> 00:00:59,880
When you've achieved
what you need to achieve.

28
00:00:59,881 --> 00:01:00,780
Then the next question is,

29
00:01:00,781 --> 00:01:01,081
okay,

30
00:01:01,081 --> 00:01:03,450
well now I'm that person,

31
00:01:03,451 --> 00:01:04,650
or I have that character.

32
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:05,813
What?

33
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:07,740
What do I need to do next?

34
00:01:07,741 --> 00:01:08,700
And some of that is always,

35
00:01:08,701 --> 00:01:08,821
well,

36
00:01:08,821 --> 00:01:10,230
what do I need to give up now?

37
00:01:10,231 --> 00:01:13,170
What do I need to let go of so
I can move to the next plateau?

38
00:01:13,171 --> 00:01:13,381
Right?

39
00:01:13,381 --> 00:01:14,520
As soon as your life as a,

40
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:15,653
hopefully a,

41
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:17,910
a sequence of upward moving,

42
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:19,553
what would you call them?

43
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:20,800
It's like scissor office.

44
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:21,720
Except you're actually,

45
00:01:21,721 --> 00:01:23,310
each time you climb up the mountain,

46
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:26,040
you get a little higher on the
mountain at something like that.

47
00:01:26,041 --> 00:01:28,940
So it says office with
an optimistic bent and,

48
00:01:29,470 --> 00:01:30,000
and,

49
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,480
and maybe if you push the rock up the
mountain properly and let it roll down

50
00:01:33,481 --> 00:01:34,314
then.

51
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:35,220
And if you do that right,

52
00:01:35,221 --> 00:01:35,911
then it's okay.

53
00:01:35,911 --> 00:01:37,110
Every time you roll it back up,

54
00:01:37,111 --> 00:01:37,550
it's,

55
00:01:37,550 --> 00:01:39,150
it's better in some sense.

56
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:41,220
And I don't think that's
unrealistic either.

57
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:42,683
And so,

58
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:43,400
well.
