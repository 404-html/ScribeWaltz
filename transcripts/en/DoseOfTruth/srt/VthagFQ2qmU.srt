1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:01,950
You cite a tired brain,

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:06,090
foggy thinking as the reason to stop
answering questions or giving a talk.

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,970
How do you combat this well
working or writing daily?

4
00:00:09,890 --> 00:00:10,350
Um,

5
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:11,183
well,

6
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:14,790
I eat a big breakfast
relatively soon on waking.

7
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:15,900
That really helps.

8
00:00:15,901 --> 00:00:19,590
If any of you out there are anxious
and many of you no doubt are,

9
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:23,250
there'll be a large number of you who
are anxious and don't eat breakfast and

10
00:00:23,251 --> 00:00:24,750
there'll be a whole bunch
of you out there who think,

11
00:00:24,751 --> 00:00:24,871
well,

12
00:00:24,871 --> 00:00:25,710
I don't eat breakfast.

13
00:00:25,711 --> 00:00:26,491
It isn't necessary.

14
00:00:26,491 --> 00:00:26,790
It's like,

15
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:27,690
that's wrong.

16
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:28,800
It's necessary.

17
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:30,180
You fasted all night.

18
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:33,780
If you load yourself cognitively
or physiologically in the morning,

19
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:36,270
your brain stressed will produce,

20
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:37,230
um,

21
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:39,390
will encourage your
body to produce insulin.

22
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:43,080
It will take all the blood sugar out of
your blood and then you're done for the

23
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:44,640
day and then you'll be anxious.

24
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:46,740
And another lot of the rest of you too,

25
00:00:46,741 --> 00:00:47,940
you'll find if you're anxious,

26
00:00:47,941 --> 00:00:48,480
try this.

27
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:49,111
It's really,

28
00:00:49,111 --> 00:00:50,010
really interesting.

29
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:51,023
Um,

30
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:51,953
experiment.

31
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:54,060
The next time you're anxious,

32
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:55,050
go eat something.

33
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:56,303
Eat like,

34
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:58,440
eat some protein and fat would be best.

35
00:00:58,441 --> 00:00:59,730
You could have cheese and crackers.

36
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,410
I'm not a big fan of carbohydrates,

37
00:01:01,411 --> 00:01:02,244
but whatever.

38
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:04,230
Eat whatever you're willing to eat,

39
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:05,280
but make it solid.

40
00:01:05,281 --> 00:01:08,460
Don't eat a peanut butter or don't eat
a chocolate bar or something sweet.

41
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:09,960
Eat something substantial,

42
00:01:09,961 --> 00:01:10,591
a piece of meat,

43
00:01:10,591 --> 00:01:11,490
a piece of cheese,

44
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:12,570
some peanut butter,

45
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:13,530
something like that,

46
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:18,030
and then wait 10 minutes and see if
you're less anxious and tried out for like

47
00:01:18,031 --> 00:01:18,601
two weeks.

48
00:01:18,601 --> 00:01:19,590
Every time you get anxious,

49
00:01:19,591 --> 00:01:22,830
eat something because then you
can find out if you're anxious,

50
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:26,880
if your anxiety is linked to low blood
sugar and it's very likely that it is,

51
00:01:26,881 --> 00:01:31,320
especially if you also get irritable
and foggy in your thinking and so,

52
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:35,280
and the best way to treat that
as far as I've been able to tell,

53
00:01:35,281 --> 00:01:36,660
and there's a decent literature on this,

54
00:01:36,661 --> 00:01:39,570
is to make sure that you eat a
big breakfast and you might say,

55
00:01:39,571 --> 00:01:39,751
well,

56
00:01:39,751 --> 00:01:40,800
I'm not hungry in the morning.

57
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:41,011
It's like,

58
00:01:41,011 --> 00:01:42,540
who the hell cares if you're hungry?

59
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:44,670
I didn't say enjoy your breakfast.

60
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:45,631
I said,

61
00:01:45,631 --> 00:01:46,050
eat it.

62
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:47,310
That's not the same thing.

63
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:50,730
You know there's lots of things that
you need to do that you don't enjoy to

64
00:01:50,731 --> 00:01:51,181
begin with.

65
00:01:51,181 --> 00:01:53,670
You'll get hungry in six months
and then you'll start to enjoy it.

66
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:55,560
So that's a massive difference.

67
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:57,810
I take small naps quite frequently.

68
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,130
If I'm wiped out,

69
00:01:59,490 --> 00:01:59,761
you know,

70
00:01:59,761 --> 00:02:04,200
I'll go have a nap for 10 minutes or 15
minutes and then that helps quite a lot.

71
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:05,220
Um,

72
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:08,940
I try to wake up fairly regular,

73
00:02:08,950 --> 00:02:10,590
a lot on a fairly regular schedule.

74
00:02:10,591 --> 00:02:13,680
That's another thing I would really
recommend for people whose lives are in

75
00:02:13,681 --> 00:02:15,000
disarray and who are anxious.

76
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:17,310
Try to fix your wake time,

77
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:18,750
sleep going when you sleep.

78
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:20,040
That's not so important.

79
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:21,090
So you can still,

80
00:02:21,091 --> 00:02:21,480
you know,

81
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:23,310
stay up late and have fun and all that.

82
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:25,440
But getting up in the
morning is really helpful.

83
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:27,173
So,

84
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,313
um,

85
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:29,191
you know,

86
00:02:29,191 --> 00:02:29,501
and you,

87
00:02:29,501 --> 00:02:32,310
you also have to figure out
how much you can work or write.

88
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:35,040
I can't write for more than about Max.

89
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:38,490
My sustainable maximum for
writing is three hours a day.

90
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:40,350
And if I push it past that,

91
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:42,830
then especially if I'm editing,

92
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:43,260
I,

93
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:44,820
I make mistakes when I'm editing.

94
00:02:44,821 --> 00:02:48,240
So that's counterproductive and
I can't sustain it across time.

95
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:53,010
And so I don't really think you can do
more than about three hours of extremely

96
00:02:53,011 --> 00:02:54,780
intense intellectual work a day.

97
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,010
Although if you have a nap,

98
00:02:56,490 --> 00:02:57,450
you can stretch that.

99
00:02:57,451 --> 00:03:00,370
But I think at least I up
paying for it across time.

100
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:02,530
So nap,

101
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:03,790
make sure you eat,

102
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:04,870
um,

103
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:07,840
and make sure you eat protein and
fat and not carbohydrates because

104
00:03:07,841 --> 00:03:09,640
carbohydrates are basically poisonous.

105
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:10,833
Um,

106
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:14,260
that's about,

107
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:16,360
that's about and make sure
that you get enough sleep.

108
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:17,290
So that's,

109
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:20,800
that's how I combat it and try
to make myself hyper efficient,

110
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:22,960
which is also a really
interesting thing to try.

111
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:24,130
You know,

112
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:26,320
I was talking to my agents at CAA,

113
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:29,550
creative artists agency in La
and I just hired a publicist to,

114
00:03:29,551 --> 00:03:32,770
to help me manage media in
a more intelligent manner.

115
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:35,590
And we're trying to think about
our overarching philosophy.

116
00:03:35,591 --> 00:03:40,570
You know when I first proposed to the
CA guys that are overarching philosophy

117
00:03:40,571 --> 00:03:41,530
would be something like,

118
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:45,910
cause you need an overarching philosophy
under which you nest all your specific

119
00:03:45,911 --> 00:03:46,361
actions.

120
00:03:46,361 --> 00:03:50,260
It was something like to educate as
many people as possible in the shortest

121
00:03:50,261 --> 00:03:51,094
period of time,

122
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:52,600
which seems like a really good goal.

123
00:03:52,601 --> 00:03:52,781
Like,

124
00:03:52,781 --> 00:03:54,040
why the hell not do that?

125
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:56,200
But then we broadened out
a little bit this week,

126
00:03:56,201 --> 00:04:00,970
which was to try to do
as much good possible as
efficiently as possible and that

127
00:04:00,971 --> 00:04:02,410
efficiency thing is really fun.

128
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:04,840
If you guys who are listening
are out for a challenge,

129
00:04:04,841 --> 00:04:06,670
like one of the things that you can,

130
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:10,090
I think this heightens the meaning in
your life is to try to do difficult

131
00:04:10,091 --> 00:04:10,750
things,

132
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:11,110
right?

133
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:11,943
Aim High,

134
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:16,360
don't name so damn high you can't manage
it and make sure you break down your

135
00:04:16,361 --> 00:04:19,510
aims into reasonably attainable sub goals,

136
00:04:19,511 --> 00:04:22,780
but you want to aim high and then you
want to see how hyper efficient you can

137
00:04:22,781 --> 00:04:23,350
get.

138
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:26,410
That's a great thing to do in
your early twenties is to see,

139
00:04:26,411 --> 00:04:26,711
okay,

140
00:04:26,711 --> 00:04:28,300
like discipline yourself.

141
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:28,751
You think,

142
00:04:28,751 --> 00:04:28,991
okay,

143
00:04:28,991 --> 00:04:32,470
how much work can I do if I load
myself right to the maximum?

144
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:33,970
How far do I,

145
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:35,110
how far can I work?

146
00:04:35,111 --> 00:04:38,170
How hard can I work
until I exhaust myself?

147
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:43,120
And then you back off obviously because
the optimal amount of working productive

148
00:04:43,121 --> 00:04:43,661
engagement,

149
00:04:43,661 --> 00:04:44,440
let's say,

150
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:47,350
is that which is
sustainable across decades.

151
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:47,980
So you have to,

152
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:48,910
you have to learn that,

153
00:04:48,911 --> 00:04:52,000
but you don't learn that
without stretching yourself
to your limits to begin

154
00:04:52,001 --> 00:04:52,660
with.

155
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:53,171
And you know,

156
00:04:53,171 --> 00:04:55,000
if your life isn't everything it could be,

157
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:57,790
and if you're suffering from
an excess of meaninglessness,

158
00:04:57,970 --> 00:05:01,360
well it means you're not oriented in
the world of chaos and order properly.

159
00:05:01,361 --> 00:05:03,190
It's like you could learn
to discipline yourself,

160
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:04,541
look,

161
00:05:04,541 --> 00:05:05,470
figure out what,

162
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:08,530
figure out what it is that you need to
do and that you want to do and then see

163
00:05:08,531 --> 00:05:09,640
how efficient you can get.

164
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:13,600
Because one of the things that's quite
fun is to figure out if you have a task,

165
00:05:13,601 --> 00:05:15,160
I always tell my graduate students this,

166
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:16,660
if they're doing an experiment too,

167
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:18,940
if you have a task that you have to do,

168
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:21,940
it's really interesting
to spend a few minutes,

169
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:22,930
sometimes hours,

170
00:05:22,931 --> 00:05:24,460
depending on how long the task is.

171
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:26,510
See if you can figure
out how to do it from,

172
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:28,360
from five to 10 times faster.

173
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,090
It means you'll have to rearrange
the way you think about it,

174
00:05:31,091 --> 00:05:34,420
but you can often do it and that's
how extremely productive people get.

175
00:05:34,421 --> 00:05:35,410
So hyper efficient,

176
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:35,831
you know,

177
00:05:35,831 --> 00:05:37,420
sometimes it means you have to delegate.

178
00:05:37,421 --> 00:05:39,850
It means sometimes it means you
have to bring other people aboard.

179
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:41,110
That's delegation as well,

180
00:05:41,111 --> 00:05:41,944
I suppose.

181
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:42,520
Um,

182
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:46,450
but there's a lot of preconceptions that
you hold about who you are and who the

183
00:05:46,451 --> 00:05:49,870
world is that you could dispense with
that would make you a way more efficient

184
00:05:49,871 --> 00:05:50,740
actor in the world.

185
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:52,023
And so,

186
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:52,580
yeah.

187
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:53,010
All right.

188
00:05:53,010 --> 00:05:54,150
So that's that.
