00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:07,801
Dr Peterson's.

2
00:00:07,801 --> 00:00:08,181
Thank you.

3
00:00:08,181 --> 00:00:09,014
First of all,

4
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:10,520
it's great pleasure being here.

5
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:12,230
It's awesome to see you live.

6
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:13,153
Um,

7
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:17,240
I basically got into your wicks just
earlier this year and I had an original

8
00:00:17,241 --> 00:00:17,691
question,

9
00:00:17,691 --> 00:00:20,330
but your talk today kind of made
me decide to change my mind.

10
00:00:20,331 --> 00:00:21,164
I'm always going to ask.

11
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:22,430
Um,

12
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:27,430
do you feel as though would you agree
with me and the sentiment that the left

13
00:00:27,651 --> 00:00:32,651
has pushed so hard for total control of
our society over the last however many

14
00:00:32,721 --> 00:00:33,554
years?

15
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:34,400
It's almost to a point,

16
00:00:34,401 --> 00:00:36,740
we're saying 2013 was a different time.

17
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:38,113
Um,

18
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:41,510
would you say that because
they pushed so hard,

19
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:45,860
they've created this backlash
and the backlash created,

20
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:47,810
caused them to backlash back again.

21
00:00:47,811 --> 00:00:50,720
So they doubled down with their
ideology and then they get,

22
00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:52,550
they lose another argument,

23
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:55,370
they lose another ideological war.

24
00:00:55,430 --> 00:01:00,260
They news losing other me more and they
doubled down and doubled down again and

25
00:01:00,261 --> 00:01:00,860
again.

26
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:02,420
And they still can't seem to meme,

27
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:03,920
they can't seem to argue.

28
00:01:04,130 --> 00:01:04,911
They can't seem,

29
00:01:04,911 --> 00:01:05,450
they can't,

30
00:01:05,450 --> 00:01:07,430
they don't want to have an
intellectual discussion.

31
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:11,000
And as an as an interpretation
of what you were saying,

32
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:11,880
there is no,

33
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:13,280
there doesn't seem to be any,

34
00:01:13,281 --> 00:01:14,114
any,

35
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:16,220
any care of what's right with them.

36
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:17,870
They just want power.

37
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:18,733
They just want,

38
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:20,150
they just want to win.

39
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:21,230
Um,

40
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:22,063
do you,

41
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,950
would you agree with the sentiment
that they're burning themselves out and

42
00:01:24,951 --> 00:01:27,770
creating the mass red pilling of the,

43
00:01:27,771 --> 00:01:28,280
uh,

44
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:30,410
conservative movement
that we see going on?

45
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:33,860
Would you possibly think that maybe
they've committed suicide and,

46
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:35,750
and talks like this,

47
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,100
people like yourself,

48
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:42,160
Ben Shapiro and others who talk to people
like what the subjects that we do the

49
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:44,360
taboo of nowadays?

50
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:45,553
Um,

51
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:48,050
possibly that this,

52
00:01:48,051 --> 00:01:50,600
this is the answer to defeat the,

53
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:52,750
the leftist stranglehold.

54
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:53,541
It's on our society.

55
00:01:53,541 --> 00:01:53,860
Let,

56
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:55,120
will untangle some of that.

57
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:55,421
Okay.

58
00:01:55,421 --> 00:01:56,320
So first of all,

59
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:57,551
well first of all,

60
00:01:57,551 --> 00:02:01,360
the first observation is
a really interesting one
because you know that things

61
00:02:01,361 --> 00:02:02,560
can go out of hand very,

62
00:02:02,561 --> 00:02:03,400
very rapidly.

63
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:04,240
Yeah.

64
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:07,030
And the reason they do that is
because of positive feedback loops.

65
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:10,780
Now the thing that Kurzweil talks
about is a positive feedback loop and

66
00:02:10,781 --> 00:02:13,960
intelligent machine makes another
intelligent machine that makes another

67
00:02:13,961 --> 00:02:15,070
intelligent machine.

68
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:19,690
And that's a positive feedback loop and
that can spiral upwards out of control

69
00:02:19,691 --> 00:02:20,381
very rapidly.

70
00:02:20,381 --> 00:02:22,090
And that's what polarization is.

71
00:02:22,091 --> 00:02:23,920
It's like I tap you,

72
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,090
you tap me,

73
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:26,050
I slap you,

74
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,980
you punch me well up and goes well.

75
00:02:29,981 --> 00:02:32,230
I think that's partly
why in the New Testament,

76
00:02:32,231 --> 00:02:32,771
for example,

77
00:02:32,771 --> 00:02:36,340
there's an injunction that
says turn the other cheek,

78
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:38,110
resist not evil.

79
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:39,603
Why?

80
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:44,080
Because otherwise you get into a positive
feedback loop and then you better look

81
00:02:44,081 --> 00:02:46,420
the hell out and things can tilt very,

82
00:02:46,421 --> 00:02:47,260
very rapidly.

83
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:47,791
I mean,

84
00:02:47,791 --> 00:02:48,401
all you have to do,

85
00:02:48,401 --> 00:02:52,060
look at what happened in World War one
new unexpected that it was like one,

86
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:57,100
one relatively minor member,

87
00:02:57,101 --> 00:02:58,450
I think of the aristocracy,

88
00:02:58,451 --> 00:03:02,830
if I remember was assassinated
in one minor little country.

89
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:04,150
It's like bang,

90
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:05,980
everything fell apart.

91
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,660
And that's positive feedback loops,

92
00:03:07,661 --> 00:03:08,470
right?

93
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:10,650
And so that's what we're in
right now and we've got to be,

94
00:03:10,651 --> 00:03:12,670
and that's a really chaotic time.

95
00:03:12,671 --> 00:03:17,671
And so I would say maintain self
control and don't aim to win.

96
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:19,510
Amen.

97
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:20,343
Peace.

98
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:21,581
Because winning,

99
00:03:21,581 --> 00:03:21,980
that's,

100
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:23,110
that's not peace.

101
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:24,790
It's better to aim for peace.

102
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:25,810
You know,

103
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:30,430
I've got this talk coming up in November
11th I'm quite worried about it because

104
00:03:30,431 --> 00:03:33,430
I know there's going to be protesters
there and that they've been emboldened by

105
00:03:33,431 --> 00:03:37,240
the fact that they shut the torque down
before and I want to make a video I'll

106
00:03:37,241 --> 00:03:41,380
probably do tomorrow telling everyone
that comes to that meeting to like watch

107
00:03:41,381 --> 00:03:46,381
their bloody step and stay out
of the gutter because you just,

108
00:03:49,210 --> 00:03:49,720
we're at,

109
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:50,500
we're at,

110
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:53,980
we're at a point now where
under the wrong circumstances,

111
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:56,740
if the wrong person does the wrong thing,

112
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,440
that the consequences will be very great.

113
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:04,470
Now we can't predict which action is
going to precipitate that and or even if

114
00:04:06,101 --> 00:04:07,210
that will happen,

115
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:10,660
but it's chaotic enough
so that it could happen.

116
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:12,220
So you know,

117
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:14,560
also govern yourselves accordingly.

118
00:04:14,561 --> 00:04:18,280
Now the problem is is that there are
people who would be happy if there was

119
00:04:18,281 --> 00:04:19,570
blood running in the street.

120
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:22,960
They're the same sort of people that
shoot up high schools or kill innocent,

121
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:23,531
you know,

122
00:04:23,531 --> 00:04:27,760
elementary school kids just to show what
they're made of and what they believe.

123
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:29,110
And that's a big problem.

124
00:04:29,111 --> 00:04:30,490
But for the rest of us,

125
00:04:30,491 --> 00:04:32,530
like hopefully calmer heads can prevail.

126
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:35,080
And so it really is important not to win.

127
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,110
It's like fighting with your wife.

128
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:39,730
You don't win.

129
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:43,510
You can't because you have to live
with her because you can't win.

130
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:47,140
But maybe you can solve the
problem and bring about peace.

131
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:50,770
And so you've got a practice
doing that practice restraint.

132
00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:55,180
And remember too that these people that
you're talking about who had radical

133
00:04:55,181 --> 00:04:56,740
leftists is most of the time,

134
00:04:56,741 --> 00:05:00,850
they're not like they're 95% like you.

135
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:02,470
And if you pull them out of the mob,

136
00:05:02,471 --> 00:05:04,360
they're just like your,

137
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:08,860
your neighbor's 19 year old kid who's
kind of clueless and rebellious.

138
00:05:08,861 --> 00:05:09,310
Right.

139
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:12,700
And who you might even like
you put them in the mob.

140
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:13,750
It's a whole different thing.

141
00:05:13,751 --> 00:05:15,690
And so you got to remember that too.

142
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:15,970
Oh,

143
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:17,290
the fear of social isolation,

144
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,470
you say no,

145
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:23,080
it's just that they're
possessed by these ideas,

146
00:05:23,081 --> 00:05:23,410
but,

147
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:24,880
but only partially,

148
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:25,923
you know,

149
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,900
you hardly find it full blooded.

150
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:32,470
Absolutely committed
radical leftist activist.

151
00:05:32,471 --> 00:05:32,711
You know,

152
00:05:32,711 --> 00:05:33,640
like there are some,

153
00:05:33,641 --> 00:05:34,451
but not very many.

154
00:05:34,451 --> 00:05:34,931
Most of it.

155
00:05:34,931 --> 00:05:37,630
It's just fragmentary behavior.

156
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:41,100
And you have to remember that like when
the students come out to protest me,

157
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:41,891
it was a case,

158
00:05:41,891 --> 00:05:43,310
particularly at McMaster,

159
00:05:43,311 --> 00:05:47,260
I have to remember these kids,

160
00:05:47,261 --> 00:05:49,330
they're not much different than my kids.

161
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:53,650
They are when they're in a stupid
mob behind a hammer and sickle flag,

162
00:05:54,010 --> 00:05:54,281
you know,

163
00:05:54,281 --> 00:05:54,850
but,

164
00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:55,180
but,

165
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:56,013
but

166
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:00,290
you don't want to make a low resolution,

167
00:06:00,291 --> 00:06:02,450
homogenous representation of them.

168
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:04,340
And so,

169
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:05,473
and so you,

170
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:06,530
that's why again,

171
00:06:06,531 --> 00:06:07,670
I think instead of winning,

172
00:06:07,671 --> 00:06:09,530
you turn to your own development.

173
00:06:09,531 --> 00:06:10,850
You turn to your own development,

174
00:06:10,851 --> 00:06:14,960
you do what you can to stop doing the
things that you're doing that aren't good

175
00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:16,640
because you're not going to hurt anybody.

176
00:06:16,641 --> 00:06:17,271
If you do that,

177
00:06:17,271 --> 00:06:18,470
all you're going to do is help.

178
00:06:18,471 --> 00:06:21,650
And otherwise you'll participate
in this polarization.

179
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:25,400
And that's unless you want that.

180
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:26,151
And you know,

181
00:06:26,151 --> 00:06:30,380
there's a dark part of people that it's
part of the part that voted for Trump

182
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:32,360
would like to burn things to the ground.

183
00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:33,410
It's like to help,

184
00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:35,780
I know how people felt when
they went into the voting booth.

185
00:06:35,781 --> 00:06:36,860
It was like Hillary,

186
00:06:36,861 --> 00:06:37,970
Hillary dealt with it.

187
00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:38,803
Trump,

188
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:39,201
you know?

189
00:06:39,201 --> 00:06:39,920
And that's,

190
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,960
that's a hell of a thing
to say to hell with it,

191
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,070
you know?

192
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:43,640
Although I could,

193
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:45,800
I could certainly
understand that sentiment.

194
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:49,040
So we have to be careful.

195
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:51,140
And all of you people who are here,

196
00:06:51,141 --> 00:06:56,141
who are advocates of free speech and who
are theoretically happy to come hear me

197
00:06:57,051 --> 00:06:57,501
speak,

198
00:06:57,501 --> 00:06:57,831
it's like,

199
00:06:57,831 --> 00:06:58,800
I really do believe it.

200
00:06:58,801 --> 00:06:59,810
I truly believe this.

201
00:06:59,811 --> 00:07:02,850
And this is something I learned in part
from social knits and in part from you.

202
00:07:02,851 --> 00:07:07,851
I missed that the way that you set the
world straight is by constraining the

203
00:07:08,061 --> 00:07:09,710
malevolence in your own heart.

204
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:11,060
And that's no joke,

205
00:07:11,061 --> 00:07:11,331
man.

206
00:07:11,331 --> 00:07:12,470
That's no easy thing.

207
00:07:12,471 --> 00:07:16,760
And that's a good voyage for people to
go on if they want something difficult

208
00:07:16,761 --> 00:07:17,750
and worthwhile to do.

209
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:18,410
So.
