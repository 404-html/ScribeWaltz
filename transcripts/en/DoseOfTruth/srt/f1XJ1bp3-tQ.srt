00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:09,890
I was wondering what you
saw with Santa Clause,

2
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:12,800
if it's a healthy thing
for parents to practice,

3
00:00:13,850 --> 00:00:16,370
what's the psychological
impact of lying to your child?

4
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:17,683
Look,

5
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:18,853
I think the,

6
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:21,980
I think lying is the wrong
way of thinking about this.

7
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:23,630
Santa Claus is a game.

8
00:00:23,631 --> 00:00:27,890
It's a game of pretend and children
play games of pretend all the time,

9
00:00:28,370 --> 00:00:28,701
you know,

10
00:00:28,701 --> 00:00:31,520
so I don't see any harm in that at all.

11
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:32,030
Now,

12
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:32,331
you know,

13
00:00:32,331 --> 00:00:37,331
you don't want to prolong that
belief beyond its natural end point.

14
00:00:38,061 --> 00:00:38,750
But it's a,

15
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:43,160
it's a massive game and it's a lovely
game and I don't believe that there's

16
00:00:43,161 --> 00:00:45,320
anything harmful in it in the least.

17
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:49,610
So now what's the psychological
impact of lying to your child?

18
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:52,100
Let's we can think about
that more generally.

19
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:53,540
Don't lie to your children.

20
00:00:54,230 --> 00:00:54,741
Don't lie.

21
00:00:54,741 --> 00:00:55,430
Period.

22
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:57,080
Lying is a really bad idea.

23
00:00:57,230 --> 00:00:58,460
It's a really bad idea.

24
00:00:58,910 --> 00:00:59,570
Um,

25
00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:00,710
it never works.

26
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:01,880
You might think it works,

27
00:01:01,881 --> 00:01:05,360
but that's only because you're blind to
the consequences and probably willfully

28
00:01:05,361 --> 00:01:06,050
blind.

29
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:07,430
Plus it's a terrible weight.

30
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:07,671
You know,

31
00:01:07,671 --> 00:01:08,300
if you,

32
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:09,200
if you don't lie,

33
00:01:09,201 --> 00:01:11,030
there's a lot fewer
things to keep track of.

34
00:01:11,031 --> 00:01:14,300
Your life is a lot more
pristine and crystally and,

35
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:18,470
and then things that you,

36
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:21,740
that come your way maybe you
deserve in some small measure.

37
00:01:21,741 --> 00:01:24,500
And it's a bad idea to lie now,

38
00:01:24,501 --> 00:01:27,580
but I don't think it's a bad idea to
play pretend games with your children.

39
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:28,460
I think that's okay.
