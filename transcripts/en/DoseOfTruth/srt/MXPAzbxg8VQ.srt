1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:00,973
Hmm,

2
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:08,930
so back to discuss,
to discuss.

3
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:12,050
So I'm.
So the fundamental thing that I learned

4
00:00:12,051 --> 00:00:15,980
from Paul Rosin is to see us as these
amazing omnivores.

5
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:19,640
This is part of our survival strategy
even more than other other apes.

6
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:23,690
We are just brilliant omnivores and we
have the Omnivore's dilemma,

7
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:27,110
which is we've got to be interested in
all kinds of new stuff.

8
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:30,950
We're not tied to one place.
We can roam onto a whole new continent.

9
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:36,410
So we were interested in stuff,
but stuff has all kinds of toxins and

10
00:00:36,411 --> 00:00:38,390
microbes.
We have to be careful about that stuff.

11
00:00:38,391 --> 00:00:41,480
And so these motives have to be
intention and this is actually an

12
00:00:41,481 --> 00:00:43,040
interesting way to understand the left
right?

13
00:00:43,041 --> 00:00:45,110
Difference.
You have to have both motives,

14
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:50,060
but if so imagined two siblings,
one of whom is set more towards trying

15
00:00:50,061 --> 00:00:51,710
new stuff,
seeking out new stuff,

16
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:53,450
and the other is a little more fearful
and we're like,

17
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:54,200
Whoa,
no,

18
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,033
let's,
you know,

19
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:55,900
let's not try that.

20
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:59,040
That stay with what's tried and true.
I mean that's progressivism and

21
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:00,500
conservatives and that's the origins of
it.

22
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:03,860
And if you look at kids' behavior at the
age of two or three,

23
00:01:04,130 --> 00:01:06,620
it does predict how it will vote much
later.

24
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:09,350
Not Hugely,
but there is a clear prediction there.

25
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:10,400
So,
um,

26
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:14,900
so disgust is part of a regulatory
system about our engagement with the

27
00:01:14,901 --> 00:01:18,740
world and whether we are just sorta out
there and,

28
00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:19,461
you know,
we,

29
00:01:19,461 --> 00:01:21,320
we,
we seek out variety and diversity.

30
00:01:21,321 --> 00:01:24,770
I think diversity is just a great thing
or whether we want a little more order

31
00:01:24,771 --> 00:01:26,030
structure,
predictability.

32
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:30,770
Conservatives are neater than a
progressive's if you take photos of

33
00:01:30,771 --> 00:01:31,990
their rooms,
um,

34
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:33,830
um,
you know,

35
00:01:33,831 --> 00:01:36,500
you can actually use the cleanliness and
organization.

36
00:01:36,501 --> 00:01:39,210
You can predict how they vote,
um,

37
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:41,870
discussed.
It turns out what's really cool about

38
00:01:41,871 --> 00:01:45,440
disgust in modern politics is if you
look at all the different things that

39
00:01:45,441 --> 00:01:47,180
we're fighting over,
especially in this country,

40
00:01:47,181 --> 00:01:48,930
our culture wars over,
you know,

41
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:50,510
going back a few decades,
you know,

42
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:51,710
sex,
drugs,

43
00:01:51,711 --> 00:01:53,000
the flag,
immigration,

44
00:01:53,001 --> 00:01:53,834
all of these things.

45
00:01:54,050 --> 00:01:56,360
Um,
I have a study with my colleagues was

46
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:58,420
led by Seneca Leyva,
um,

47
00:01:58,670 --> 00:02:02,180
in which we asked all these cultural war
attitudes of people.

48
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:04,790
And we also had their scores.
And the discus scale,

49
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:08,510
but one of the foundations of morality
is sanctity and purity and it relates to

50
00:02:08,511 --> 00:02:11,630
discuss.
What we found is that if you know,

51
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:15,500
if you know what people's left,
right,

52
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:17,240
how they place themselves in the left
rightscale,

53
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:21,680
you can pretty much predict where they
fall on most cultural war attitudes

54
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:26,480
except for those that load on or
implicate sanctity or purity.

55
00:02:26,481 --> 00:02:28,790
So what I mean his flag burning.
Okay.

56
00:02:28,791 --> 00:02:29,511
Do you think,
you know,

57
00:02:29,511 --> 00:02:32,290
do you think that people should have the
right to burn the American flag or

58
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:35,420
country's flag as an expression,
as a political action?

59
00:02:35,421 --> 00:02:39,050
What do you think people can give some
answer in a one to seven scale and

60
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:40,280
people on the right?

61
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:42,770
Think more like the say no.
People on the left,

62
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:46,310
yes.
People who score high on loyalty are

63
00:02:46,311 --> 00:02:49,250
more likely to say no.
People who have low run it say yes,

64
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:51,800
and that's even taking account of where
they are on the left right dimension.

65
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:53,760
But here's the cool thing.
Um,

66
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,460
it's only if you add in the purity or
sanctity thing,

67
00:02:56,470 --> 00:03:00,550
but you can really understand what
people are doing because people see the

68
00:03:00,551 --> 00:03:04,900
flag not as just a piece of cloth.
They see it as having some innate

69
00:03:04,901 --> 00:03:07,330
essence,
some something sacred about it which

70
00:03:07,331 --> 00:03:09,430
must be protected.
And so,

71
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:10,600
um,
so this is true.

72
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:13,390
They think of it as a unifying center.
Exactly.

73
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:15,460
That's right.
So if there's something sacred,

74
00:03:15,461 --> 00:03:17,830
and this is the,
this is the central piece of my work

75
00:03:17,831 --> 00:03:20,920
around politics and morality is the
psychology of sanctity.
