1
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:07,780
So,

2
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:11,400
so the Mecca Medina
distinction seems to be jury,

3
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:14,990
I would say both complicated
and problematic because,

4
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:16,273
so,

5
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:17,870
so t tell me if I'm wrong.

6
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:18,261
Okay.

7
00:00:18,261 --> 00:00:23,261
Because my understanding is that Mohammed
spent most of the part of his life

8
00:00:24,021 --> 00:00:29,021
that was associated with the establishment
of Islam in Medina and northern neck.

9
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:33,890
And that it wasn't until he went to
Medina that Islam actually became a force.

10
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:35,200
So back in Mecca,

11
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,910
although his doctrine
appears to have been,

12
00:00:37,970 --> 00:00:38,331
let's say,

13
00:00:38,331 --> 00:00:39,164
more peaceful,

14
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:41,480
it was also much less successful as a,

15
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:44,030
as a both a religious
and a political movement.

16
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:48,620
So then he left Mecca and I believe
under pressure from the inhabitants,

17
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:49,850
at least to some degree,

18
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:51,020
moved to Medina.

19
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:53,720
And then that's when Islam became more,

20
00:00:53,830 --> 00:00:54,350
uh,

21
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:54,850
more rep,

22
00:00:54,850 --> 00:00:57,260
more revolutionary and expansive.

23
00:00:58,070 --> 00:01:03,070
And so what do you see now I know that
it isn't universally accepted among the

24
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:08,360
Islamic community that that Mecca Medina
distinction is a reasonable one to make

25
00:01:08,361 --> 00:01:12,140
because of course the presumption is that
there's an essential unity of thought

26
00:01:12,141 --> 00:01:13,310
across the doctrines.

27
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:14,653
But,

28
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:16,153
but given,

29
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:20,180
given your interpretation and I've
read the a similar interpretation among

30
00:01:20,181 --> 00:01:20,600
other,

31
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:21,560
among other people,

32
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:23,300
do you see,

33
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:27,590
what do you see as hopeful within the
Islamic community with regards to bridging

34
00:01:27,591 --> 00:01:32,591
the gap between the say the earlier works
so to speak of Mohammed and the later,

35
00:01:33,050 --> 00:01:33,883
the later more,

36
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:36,140
more revolutionary element of the,

37
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,610
of his actions and his faith.

38
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:39,710
Is there a way that
that can be reconciled?

39
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:41,421
Well,

40
00:01:41,421 --> 00:01:44,900
so dividing of Muslims into Mecca,

41
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:46,063
a set of Mecca,

42
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,780
Medina and modifiers,

43
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:53,020
that's not of course an official this
thing except that anyone really wants to

44
00:01:54,831 --> 00:01:56,030
give to you know who,

45
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:57,380
which individuals,

46
00:01:57,381 --> 00:01:58,910
which Muslims uh,

47
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:00,230
at war with us.

48
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:04,090
And should we be worried about
what about peaceful Muslim?

49
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:07,190
What about these other
Muslims who are speaking up?

50
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:07,431
No,

51
00:02:07,431 --> 00:02:09,680
what kind of labels we will give him.

52
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:12,850
If you said the word Islam most

53
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:15,183
as a Muslim,

54
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:20,520
what was the last thing that I look is
that selected and in their selection who

55
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,240
justify their,

56
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:26,580
actually they said both methods.

57
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:28,820
Alondra to legacy in Mecca.

58
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:29,960
Because as I was,

59
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:33,870
if my sister tells me
you've missed the pair,

60
00:02:33,871 --> 00:02:35,240
you need to get up and say,

61
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:36,440
I was involved,

62
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:37,850
some of us for my parents say,

63
00:02:37,851 --> 00:02:42,370
oh come on my relationship with
a lot these intimate and unique,

64
00:02:42,371 --> 00:02:44,930
maybe it's none of your
business to tell him what to do.

65
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:48,660
And then she would come up with
some other or some other Thursday.

66
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:53,760
But it's my easy to command and hold on,

67
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:55,830
I'm sorry.

68
00:02:56,530 --> 00:03:01,530
But then the lithium was going to extent
underused Decisely and I'm not the only

69
00:03:02,201 --> 00:03:05,440
one the other scholars like and
that there are many other scholars

70
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:11,050
who needs to see a window piece.

71
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:12,070
I think his mom.

72
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,020
Okay,

73
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:13,853
okay.

74
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:19,140
Additional or the culture
as a civilization and at
the same time putting to ban

75
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:20,910
this violin,

76
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:25,310
providing courses within Islam.

77
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:27,160
Try and do that.

78
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:32,550
Then you'll go to see your work
to make a list of all the concepts

79
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:40,720
that we really don't have any problem
with people being told to pay five times a

80
00:03:40,721 --> 00:03:45,520
day or is this letter or in the
[inaudible] and all sorts of,

81
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:46,350
you know,

82
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:48,530
religious features I think
don't have a problem.

83
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:49,810
Well,

84
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:50,141
all of,

85
00:03:50,141 --> 00:03:50,980
that's what they did.

86
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:53,740
That's the Mecca and Medina,

87
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:54,603
as you said,

88
00:03:55,390 --> 00:03:56,650
a political philosophy.

89
00:03:56,950 --> 00:03:57,560
They're dishonest.

90
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:59,450
And the literacy Muhammad,

91
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:01,860
we just them and that's,

92
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:05,080
and that's exactly when it was loud.

93
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:06,060
Okay,

94
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:11,060
I'm successful and this is just today
I tried to end it in and they say

95
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:16,513
Paul

96
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:17,403
to be

97
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:19,610
what to be emulating.

98
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:23,460
So that's I think where you were saying,

99
00:04:23,461 --> 00:04:24,294
you know,

100
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:26,070
the neck of the unit and Poker Martha

101
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:33,830
classification that we applied
social sciences has its problems.

102
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:37,300
But this was sort of simplifies
because it focuses oh,

103
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:38,920
after you should what it should.

104
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:41,441
Okay.

105
00:04:41,441 --> 00:04:43,810
So you see this as an externally applied,

106
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:45,123
um,

107
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:45,960
uh,

108
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:50,140
a category system essentially
useful that's useful for,

109
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,393
for,

110
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:56,460
for outsiders who are trying to assess
the situation to determine who it is that

111
00:04:57,431 --> 00:05:00,670
you're dealing with that might be regarded
as an ally and who it is that you're

112
00:05:00,671 --> 00:05:01,091
dealing with.

113
00:05:01,091 --> 00:05:02,520
It might be regarded as a fault,

114
00:05:02,521 --> 00:05:03,191
so to speak.

115
00:05:03,191 --> 00:05:05,510
And that would be on the more
militant end of things is that,

116
00:05:05,511 --> 00:05:05,910
that,

117
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:08,200
that that's a reasonable
way of looking at it.

118
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:10,370
That's reasonable.

119
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:11,750
That's a reasonable way of looking at it.

120
00:05:11,751 --> 00:05:15,620
But also if you take the moderate
versus extreme classification or

121
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:19,430
categorization that has
become common placed,

122
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:21,590
it does is tell you what,

123
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,050
when we look at that model,

124
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:26,000
we think of people who
are not using by us.

125
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:26,770
We're,

126
00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:27,910
if you look at Medina,

127
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:33,340
you will see that there are hundreds of
thousands of Muslims who do not apply

128
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,240
violence now,

129
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:38,580
but who do preach about
and they do move peach,

130
00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:41,240
the Makino legacies and
they believe it should be.

131
00:05:41,241 --> 00:05:42,590
It should be instituted.

132
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:44,450
And in places where the guests,

133
00:05:44,451 --> 00:05:46,490
where you get a majority of these,

134
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:48,600
none of violence and the types,

135
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,270
the center,

136
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:53,640
this has applied and forces we alone.

137
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,850
So I think that the toms
model is an extreme.

138
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:57,710
I just was not good enough.

139
00:05:57,711 --> 00:05:59,980
They don't cover the
well and they also don't,

140
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:04,010
they don't also seem to
bear any relationship to the
internal diet dynamics of

141
00:06:04,011 --> 00:06:05,000
the faith itself.

142
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:06,620
So that that's also problematic.

143
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:07,491
Okay,

144
00:06:07,491 --> 00:06:09,500
so does that,

145
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:12,650
because you have to keep
going back to the theology,

146
00:06:12,651 --> 00:06:17,651
you have to keep going back to the
internal debate among Muslims are a on and

147
00:06:18,501 --> 00:06:20,100
how to be late to the hospital.

148
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:24,890
So I personally think Mecca and
Medina is much more useful as a tool,

149
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:29,180
as an external perceptual framework for
understanding the problem we face is

150
00:06:29,181 --> 00:06:30,014
Islam,

151
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:33,680
then x team versus versus
white bread and all the,

152
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:35,750
all the other terms that we have.
