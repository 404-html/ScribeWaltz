1
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:09,530
Dr. Peterson.

2
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:11,393
Thank you for coming.

3
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:12,161
We all,

4
00:00:12,161 --> 00:00:12,370
uh,

5
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:13,560
appreciate it a lot.

6
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:14,070
Uh,

7
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:18,720
I wanted to get your opinion on
censorship that we're seeing on the web.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:19,170
Uh,

9
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:20,190
it's accelerating.

10
00:00:20,191 --> 00:00:21,690
You were a very notable example.

11
00:00:21,691 --> 00:00:24,760
You were locked out of your
Gmail and B and Trump account.

12
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:25,673
Pardon me?

13
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:26,941
Oh yeah.

14
00:00:26,941 --> 00:00:29,700
Trump just got a deleted
by an air in person,

15
00:00:29,701 --> 00:00:29,911
you know,

16
00:00:29,911 --> 00:00:34,050
now they're saying that perhaps this
was just a contractor and you know,

17
00:00:34,051 --> 00:00:34,884
maybe,

18
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:35,280
uh,

19
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:39,900
someone from Twitter who's gone
in a very far left direction,

20
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:40,021
uh,

21
00:00:40,021 --> 00:00:42,330
youtube has gone in a
very far left erection.

22
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:43,051
Uh,

23
00:00:43,051 --> 00:00:43,950
I'm just wondering,

24
00:00:43,951 --> 00:00:44,910
I've started a,

25
00:00:44,911 --> 00:00:47,220
an alternative to youtube called Pew Tube.

26
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:47,850
Uh,

27
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:48,990
what kind of,

28
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:49,913
um,

29
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:50,441
what,

30
00:00:50,441 --> 00:00:54,610
what do you see for possible solutions
and just your thoughts in general or is

31
00:00:54,611 --> 00:00:55,444
it not?

32
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:56,373
Here's an

33
00:00:56,590 --> 00:00:57,423
crazy thought,

34
00:00:57,970 --> 00:00:59,590
but I'm going to tell it to you anyways.

35
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:00,101
Sorry.

36
00:01:00,101 --> 00:01:02,650
I was just reading one
of Ray Kurzweil's books,

37
00:01:02,651 --> 00:01:03,401
I think it was called,

38
00:01:03,401 --> 00:01:04,330
how to make a mind.

39
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:05,620
I really liked it actually.

40
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:10,900
It helped me understand how the brain
compresses information because the world

41
00:01:10,901 --> 00:01:11,820
is really complicated,

42
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:15,610
so you have to make a low resolution
representation of it to live in it.

43
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:19,390
And he actually explained to me in a way
that I hadn't really understood how the

44
00:01:19,391 --> 00:01:21,130
brain might do that neurologically.

45
00:01:21,131 --> 00:01:21,964
So that was cool.

46
00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:22,451
But you know,

47
00:01:22,451 --> 00:01:25,450
Kurt's while this guy who
thinks that he's a smart guy,

48
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:28,440
a very smart guy and uh,

49
00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:32,680
he's invented a fair bit of high
end technical technological,

50
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:33,563
uh,

51
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:37,510
software and hardware and he's the guy
that thinks that we're heading towards

52
00:01:37,511 --> 00:01:38,350
the singularity.

53
00:01:38,351 --> 00:01:39,700
And so the singularity is,

54
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:40,121
you know,

55
00:01:40,121 --> 00:01:45,121
how processing speed doubles every 18
months and like hard disk capacity every

56
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:48,400
year and there's a bunch
of doublings going on,

57
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:52,720
a huge number of them and
they accelerate exponentially.

58
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:55,210
And so it's probably,

59
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,770
we're probably three years away,

60
00:01:56,830 --> 00:02:01,200
maybe even less then from
building a computer that has,

61
00:02:01,201 --> 00:02:06,201
is the capacity to make
as many calculations as
reasonable estimates of the

62
00:02:06,701 --> 00:02:08,860
calculating capacity
of the human brain are,

63
00:02:09,010 --> 00:02:11,800
are currently set up 18 months away,

64
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:13,571
two years away,

65
00:02:13,571 --> 00:02:14,470
something like that.

66
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:20,020
And then we're 18 months away from having
one that's twice that fast and then 18

67
00:02:20,021 --> 00:02:22,360
months away from having one
that's twice as fast as that.

68
00:02:22,361 --> 00:02:24,070
So that's like say six years

69
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:29,050
and we've got something that's eight
times as smart as a human being.

70
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:31,210
But there's a twist on that.

71
00:02:31,211 --> 00:02:32,650
And this is Kurt swells twist,

72
00:02:32,651 --> 00:02:35,590
which is as soon as you make a machine
smart enough to make the next machine

73
00:02:35,591 --> 00:02:36,670
that's smarter than it,

74
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:42,030
which is sort of what we're doing because
computers are so fast that that will

75
00:02:42,131 --> 00:02:46,150
scale up to near infinite computing
computing power almost instantaneously.

76
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:49,480
Now you think?

77
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:49,961
No,

78
00:02:49,961 --> 00:02:50,651
probably not.

79
00:02:50,651 --> 00:02:52,190
And Allen,

80
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:56,950
Bob Gates partner has written critiques
of Kurtzweil while and you know,

81
00:02:56,980 --> 00:03:00,070
you might think if something's impossible
then it won't even if you don't know

82
00:03:00,071 --> 00:03:00,431
why.

83
00:03:00,431 --> 00:03:03,700
And there's reasons to not
think that that will happen.

84
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:08,730
But Kurzweil's traced back the doubling
of computing power way before the

85
00:03:09,101 --> 00:03:12,780
existence of the transistor and
it's been ridiculously stable,

86
00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:13,990
crazily stable.

87
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:17,500
So God only knows what
we're coming up with here.

88
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:18,640
You know,

89
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:22,150
and you don't know what something of
infinite computing power might be like.

90
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:24,640
Like you seriously don't know.

91
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:27,550
And there are serious people who are very,

92
00:03:27,551 --> 00:03:28,001
very,

93
00:03:28,001 --> 00:03:29,320
very worried about that.

94
00:03:29,321 --> 00:03:30,041
They're very worried,

95
00:03:30,041 --> 00:03:30,611
for example,

96
00:03:30,611 --> 00:03:34,420
that companies like Facebook and
Google will manage that first.

97
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:35,381
And you know,

98
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:38,950
those companies are already
making censorship AI bots.

99
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:40,091
And that's what,

100
00:03:40,091 --> 00:03:40,780
that's smart.

101
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:43,510
It's sort of like making really
fast robots that can shoot people.

102
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:44,710
It's not that smart.

103
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:46,810
And we're doing that to very rapidly.

104
00:03:46,811 --> 00:03:47,381
And you know,

105
00:03:47,381 --> 00:03:50,980
I know some guys who work in advanced
AI and you know how you look,

106
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:54,550
you watch the term terminator movies and
you see the robots that miss when they

107
00:03:54,551 --> 00:03:55,384
shoot at you.

108
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:59,620
Like they're not very bright because the
bright ones not only shoot at where you

109
00:03:59,621 --> 00:03:59,891
are,

110
00:03:59,891 --> 00:04:02,680
but they estimate where you're going to
be when you make your escape moves and

111
00:04:02,681 --> 00:04:07,681
they shoot their simultaneously and their
death rate is 100% and so there's no

112
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:11,080
war against the robots.

113
00:04:11,081 --> 00:04:11,351
I mean,

114
00:04:11,351 --> 00:04:12,340
when those things get going,

115
00:04:12,341 --> 00:04:15,160
they're going to be so much faster than
us that will look like we're moving

116
00:04:15,161 --> 00:04:16,390
through molasses to them.

117
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:17,853
So

118
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:21,921
you know,

119
00:04:21,921 --> 00:04:25,310
so maybe what we're deciding now with
all of our individual decisions about

120
00:04:25,311 --> 00:04:28,070
censorship and the way that we're going
to construct the world and all that is

121
00:04:28,071 --> 00:04:31,280
exactly what kind of super intelligence
we're going to bring into being.

122
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:35,480
And I would suggest that we try to bring
one in that's good and moral rather

123
00:04:35,481 --> 00:04:37,520
than one that's evil and demonic,

124
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:40,063
right?

125
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:44,060
So what can we do about that?

126
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:49,970
There's only one answer to that.

127
00:04:49,971 --> 00:04:53,840
As far as I know that that
works is gay rock together.

128
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:57,230
You're going to be the
person who's working in Ai,

129
00:04:57,530 --> 00:04:58,363
right?

130
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:00,020
I know some of these people,

131
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:03,770
they better be good people because they're
going to build whatever they're like

132
00:05:03,771 --> 00:05:04,730
into their machines.

133
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:08,600
They better have their head screwed
on straight cause they're going to get

134
00:05:08,601 --> 00:05:09,980
amplified like math.

135
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:14,090
And I don't like what's happening
with Google and Facebook and Youtube,

136
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:17,980
they're building censorship
bots predicated on a
certain kind of ideology and

137
00:05:17,981 --> 00:05:20,090
the kind of ideology
that we outlined today.

138
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:22,220
It's a very bad idea.

139
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:29,220
Hopefully good people will stop that.

140
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:31,051
So then that,

141
00:05:31,051 --> 00:05:34,350
what that means is that your
moral obligation is to be good.

142
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:38,460
And the way you do that is
first by stopping being bad.

143
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:40,830
And everyone can do that a little bit.

144
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:46,460
So I hope that's what
everyone does because the
consequences of not doing it are

145
00:05:47,041 --> 00:05:48,300
not going to be pleasant.

146
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:49,163
They never are.

147
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:51,583
Thank you.

148
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:53,880
Hi.

149
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:54,161
Uh,

150
00:05:54,161 --> 00:05:56,400
this question is about your
biblical lecture series.

151
00:05:57,170 --> 00:05:58,003
Um,

152
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:00,170
I liked that one because
it's about genesis,

153
00:06:00,171 --> 00:06:02,830
which is usually ignored as being,

154
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:05,000
we're this post enlightenment society,

155
00:06:05,001 --> 00:06:06,680
you don't need these
ancient creation myths.

156
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:10,820
And also I thought revelations kind
of gets the same treatment as being

157
00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:15,860
dismissed because it's the
crazy hallucinogenic trip.

158
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:18,890
That's why some isolated mad man
in the middle of the Mediterranean.

159
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,710
So I was wondering if after
you're done with genesis,

160
00:06:21,711 --> 00:06:23,630
if you were thinking
about doing revelations,

161
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:25,580
not without traversing the,

162
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:27,860
the geography in between.

163
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:29,173
Okay.

164
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:29,901
Yeah.

165
00:06:29,901 --> 00:06:33,080
I want to walk through the whole thing
if I can do that before I expire.

166
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:36,110
So,

167
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:36,411
I mean,

168
00:06:36,411 --> 00:06:40,760
I've read it and thought about
it and it's such a strange book,

169
00:06:40,761 --> 00:06:45,170
a because it's really big among
the evangelical Republican
types and you'd think

170
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,153
really,

171
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,460
really that's the book that's,

172
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,630
but you're relying on,

173
00:06:49,631 --> 00:06:50,540
have you read it?

174
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:51,420
It's,

175
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:51,910
it's,

176
00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:52,191
it's,

177
00:06:52,191 --> 00:06:52,620
uh,

178
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:53,420
it's,

179
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:55,430
it's a crazy hallucinogenic trip.

180
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:57,290
That's what revelation is now.

181
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:02,320
That's not to play it down because God
only knows about crazy hallucinogenic

182
00:07:03,351 --> 00:07:04,184
trips,

183
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:05,240
that's for sure.

184
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:06,163
I mean there's,

185
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:08,030
there's accruing evidence.

186
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:12,620
I would say that a tremendous amount
of the religious orientation of human

187
00:07:12,621 --> 00:07:13,101
beings,

188
00:07:13,101 --> 00:07:13,311
you know,

189
00:07:13,311 --> 00:07:14,960
that deep mythological,

190
00:07:14,961 --> 00:07:19,280
symbolic orientation is in no small
part a consequence of humanities

191
00:07:19,281 --> 00:07:21,590
experimentation with
psychedelics substances.

192
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:22,761
I think that's,

193
00:07:22,761 --> 00:07:27,260
that the evidence for that I think
has become virtually an overwhelming.

194
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:28,873
So

195
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:30,740
anyways,

196
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:31,610
I will get there.

197
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:32,473
Maybe,

198
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:35,930
probably not because at the rate
I'm going through the first stories,

199
00:07:35,931 --> 00:07:37,480
it'll take me forever to get there.

200
00:07:37,481 --> 00:07:38,150
Right.

201
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:38,983
But that's okay.

202
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:40,700
So thank you.

203
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:41,593
Yeah.

204
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:44,271
Dr. Peterson.

205
00:07:44,271 --> 00:07:44,581
Thank you.

206
00:07:44,581 --> 00:07:45,414
First of all,

207
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:46,970
it's great pleasure being here.

208
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:48,620
It's awesome to see you live.

209
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:49,543
Um,

210
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:53,660
I basically got into your work's just
earlier this year and I had an original

211
00:07:53,661 --> 00:07:54,081
question,

212
00:07:54,081 --> 00:07:56,740
but your talk today kind of made
me decide to change my mind.

213
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:57,633
I was going to ask,

214
00:07:57,980 --> 00:07:58,813
um,

215
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:03,820
do you feel as though would you agree
with me and the sentiment that the left

216
00:08:04,041 --> 00:08:09,041
has pushed so hard for total control of
our society over the last however many

217
00:08:09,111 --> 00:08:09,944
years?

218
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:13,160
It's almost to a point where
saying 2013 was a different time.

219
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:14,543
Um,

220
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:17,960
would you say that because
they pushed so hard,

221
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:22,250
they've created this backlash
and the backlash created,

222
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:24,230
caused them to backlash back again.

223
00:08:24,231 --> 00:08:27,110
So they doubled down with their
ideology and then they get,

224
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:28,970
they lose another argument.

225
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:31,790
They lose another ideological war.

226
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:36,470
They knew lose another me more and they
doubled down and they double down again

227
00:08:36,471 --> 00:08:38,840
and again and they just
can't seem to meme,

228
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,340
they can't seem to argue.

229
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,331
They can't seem,

230
00:08:41,331 --> 00:08:41,840
they can't,

231
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,820
they don't want to have an
intellectual discussion.

232
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:47,390
And as an interpretation
of what you were saying,

233
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:48,290
there is no,

234
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:49,700
there doesn't seem to be any,

235
00:08:49,701 --> 00:08:50,534
any,

236
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:52,610
any care of what's right with them.

237
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,260
They just want power.

238
00:08:54,290 --> 00:08:55,123
They just want,

239
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:56,550
they just want to win.

240
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:57,630
Um,

241
00:08:57,630 --> 00:08:58,463
do you,

242
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,350
would you agree with the sentiment
that they're burning themselves out and

243
00:09:01,351 --> 00:09:04,170
creating the mass red pilling of the,

244
00:09:04,171 --> 00:09:04,680
uh,

245
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,810
conservative movement
that we see going on?

246
00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:10,260
Would you possibly think to maybe
they've committed suicide and,

247
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:12,150
and talks like this,

248
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,500
people like yourself,

249
00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:18,530
Ben Shapiro and others who talk to people
like what the subjects that we do the

250
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:20,760
taboo of nowadays,

251
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:21,953
um,

252
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:24,450
possibly that this,

253
00:09:24,451 --> 00:09:26,990
this is the answer to defeat the,

254
00:09:27,530 --> 00:09:29,130
the leftist strangle angle hold

255
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:29,391
it's on.

256
00:09:29,391 --> 00:09:31,520
Our society will untangle some of that.

257
00:09:31,521 --> 00:09:31,821
Okay.

258
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:32,720
So first of all,

259
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:33,951
well first of all,

260
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:37,760
the first observation is
a really interesting one
because you know that things

261
00:09:37,761 --> 00:09:38,960
can go out of hand very,

262
00:09:38,961 --> 00:09:39,800
very rapidly.

263
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:40,640
Yeah.

264
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:43,430
And the reason they do that is
because of positive feedback loops.

265
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:46,790
Now the thing that Kurzweil talks
about is a positive feedback loop.

266
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:50,360
And intelligent machine makes another
intelligent machine that makes another

267
00:09:50,361 --> 00:09:51,470
intelligent machine.

268
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:53,120
And that's a positive feedback loop.

269
00:09:53,121 --> 00:09:56,780
And that can spiral upwards
out of control very rapidly.

270
00:09:56,781 --> 00:09:58,490
And that's when polarization is,

271
00:09:58,491 --> 00:09:59,324
it's like,

272
00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:00,320
I tap you,

273
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:01,490
you tap me,

274
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:02,450
I slapped you,

275
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,530
you punch me.

276
00:10:03,890 --> 00:10:05,540
Well up it goes.

277
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:06,381
Well.

278
00:10:06,381 --> 00:10:08,630
I think that's partly
why in the New Testament,

279
00:10:08,631 --> 00:10:09,171
for example,

280
00:10:09,171 --> 00:10:12,740
there's an injunction that
says turn the other cheek,

281
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:14,510
resist not evil.

282
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:16,063
Why?

283
00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:20,480
Because otherwise you get into a positive
feedback loop and then you better look

284
00:10:20,481 --> 00:10:22,850
the hell out and things can tilt very,

285
00:10:22,851 --> 00:10:23,684
very rapidly.

286
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:24,181
I mean,

287
00:10:24,181 --> 00:10:24,801
all you have to do,

288
00:10:24,801 --> 00:10:28,460
look at what happened in World War one
new unexpected that it was like one,

289
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:33,500
one relatively minor member,

290
00:10:33,501 --> 00:10:34,850
I think of the aristocracy,

291
00:10:34,851 --> 00:10:35,930
if I remember correctly,

292
00:10:35,931 --> 00:10:39,200
was assassinated in one
minor little country.

293
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:40,550
It's like bang,

294
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:42,380
everything fell apart.

295
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:44,060
And that's positive feedback loops,

296
00:10:44,061 --> 00:10:44,870
right?

297
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:47,030
And so that's what we're in
right now and we've got to be,

298
00:10:47,031 --> 00:10:49,070
and that's a really chaotic time.

299
00:10:49,071 --> 00:10:54,071
And so I would say maintain self
control and don't aim to win.

300
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:55,910
Amen.

301
00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:56,743
Peace.

302
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:57,981
Because winning,

303
00:10:57,981 --> 00:10:58,400
that's,

304
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,510
that's not peace.

305
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:01,190
It's better to aim for peace.

306
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:02,210
You know,

307
00:11:02,210 --> 00:11:06,830
I've got this talk coming up in November
11th I'm quite worried about it because

308
00:11:06,831 --> 00:11:09,830
I know there's going to be protesters
there and that they've been emboldened by

309
00:11:09,831 --> 00:11:13,520
the fact that they shut the talk down
before and I want to make a video.

310
00:11:13,521 --> 00:11:14,510
I'll probably do it tomorrow,

311
00:11:14,511 --> 00:11:19,490
telling everyone that comes
to that meeting to like
watch their bloody step and

312
00:11:19,491 --> 00:11:24,491
stay out of the gutter because you just,

313
00:11:25,610 --> 00:11:26,120
we're at,

314
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:26,900
we're at,

315
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:30,380
we're at a point now where
under the wrong circumstances,

316
00:11:30,410 --> 00:11:33,140
if the wrong person does the wrong thing,

317
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,840
that the consequences will be very great.

318
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:40,870
Now we can't predict which action is
going to precipitate that and or even if

319
00:11:42,501 --> 00:11:43,610
that will happen,

320
00:11:44,090 --> 00:11:47,060
but it's chaotic enough
so that it could happen.

321
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:48,740
So you know,

322
00:11:48,741 --> 00:11:50,960
so govern yourselves accordingly.

323
00:11:50,961 --> 00:11:54,670
Now the problem is is that there are
people who would be happy if there was

324
00:11:54,671 --> 00:11:55,960
blood running in the street.

325
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:59,350
They're the same sort of people that
shoot up high schools or kill innocent,

326
00:11:59,650 --> 00:11:59,951
you know,

327
00:11:59,951 --> 00:12:04,090
elementary school kids just to show what
they're made of and what they believe.

328
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,500
And that's a big problem.

329
00:12:05,501 --> 00:12:06,880
But for the rest of us,

330
00:12:06,881 --> 00:12:08,920
like hopefully calmer heads can prevail.

331
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:12,090
And so it really is
important not to win it.

332
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:14,530
It's like fighting with your wife.

333
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:16,150
You don't win.

334
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:19,900
You can't because you have to live
with her because you can't win.

335
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:23,530
But maybe you can solve the
problem and bring about peace.

336
00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:25,960
And so you've got to practice doing that.

337
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:27,160
Practice restraint.

338
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:28,660
And remember too,

339
00:12:28,661 --> 00:12:32,680
that these people that you're talking
about who had radical leftists is most of

340
00:12:32,681 --> 00:12:33,131
the time,

341
00:12:33,131 --> 00:12:37,270
they're not like they're 95% like you.

342
00:12:37,450 --> 00:12:38,860
And if you pull them out of the mob,

343
00:12:38,861 --> 00:12:40,780
they're just like your,

344
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:45,250
your neighbor's 19 year old kid who's
kind of clueless and rebellious,

345
00:12:45,251 --> 00:12:45,700
right.

346
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:49,090
And who you might even like
you put them in the mob.

347
00:12:49,091 --> 00:12:50,140
It's a whole different thing.

348
00:12:50,141 --> 00:12:52,050
And so you got to remember that too.

349
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:52,390
Oh,

350
00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:53,680
this fear of social isolation,

351
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:55,750
kind of how they're acting,

352
00:12:55,751 --> 00:12:56,890
how you say no,

353
00:12:56,891 --> 00:12:59,470
it's just that they're
possessed by these ideas,

354
00:12:59,471 --> 00:12:59,830
but,

355
00:12:59,830 --> 00:13:01,270
but only partially,

356
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,313
you know,

357
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:05,320
you hardly find it full blooded.

358
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:08,860
Absolutely committed
radical leftist activist.

359
00:13:08,861 --> 00:13:09,101
You know,

360
00:13:09,101 --> 00:13:10,060
like there are some,

361
00:13:10,061 --> 00:13:10,841
but not very many.

362
00:13:10,841 --> 00:13:11,321
Most of it.

363
00:13:11,321 --> 00:13:14,050
It's just fragmentary behavior.

364
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:17,920
And you have to remember that like when
the students come out to protest me was

365
00:13:17,921 --> 00:13:18,311
a case,

366
00:13:18,311 --> 00:13:19,730
particularly at McMaster,

367
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:23,650
have to remember these kids,

368
00:13:23,651 --> 00:13:25,720
they're not much different than my kids.

369
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:30,070
They are when they're in a stupid
mob behind a hammer and sickle flag,

370
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:30,671
you know,

371
00:13:30,671 --> 00:13:31,240
but,

372
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:31,600
but,

373
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,433
but

374
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,700
you don't want to make a low resolution,

375
00:13:36,701 --> 00:13:38,830
homogenous representation of them.

376
00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:40,683
And so,

377
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:41,853
and so you,

378
00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:42,940
that's why again,

379
00:13:42,941 --> 00:13:44,050
I think instead of winning,

380
00:13:44,051 --> 00:13:45,940
you turn to your own development.

381
00:13:45,941 --> 00:13:47,260
You turn to your own development,

382
00:13:47,261 --> 00:13:51,340
you do what you can to stop doing the
things that you're doing that aren't good

383
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:53,020
because you're not going to hurt anybody.

384
00:13:53,021 --> 00:13:53,681
If you do that,

385
00:13:53,681 --> 00:13:54,850
all you're going to do is help.

386
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:58,060
And otherwise you'll participate
in this polarization.

387
00:13:58,090 --> 00:14:01,810
And that's unless you want that.

388
00:14:01,970 --> 00:14:02,531
And you know,

389
00:14:02,531 --> 00:14:06,910
there's a dark part of people that it's
part of the part that voted for Trump

390
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,770
would like to burn things to the ground.

391
00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:09,820
It's like to hell.

392
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:12,190
I know how people felt when
they went into the voting booth.

393
00:14:12,191 --> 00:14:13,240
It was like Hillary,

394
00:14:13,241 --> 00:14:14,380
Hillary dealt with it.

395
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:15,213
Trump,

396
00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:15,611
you know,

397
00:14:15,611 --> 00:14:16,300
and that's,

398
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:18,310
that's a hell of a thing
to say to hell with it.

399
00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:19,480
You know,

400
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:20,050
although I could,

401
00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:22,180
I could certainly
understand that sentiment.

402
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:27,550
So we have to be careful and
all of you people who are here,

403
00:14:27,551 --> 00:14:32,551
who are advocates of free speech and who
are theoretically happy to come hear me

404
00:14:33,431 --> 00:14:33,881
speak.

405
00:14:33,881 --> 00:14:34,241
It's like,

406
00:14:34,241 --> 00:14:35,200
I really do believe in,

407
00:14:35,201 --> 00:14:38,410
I truly believe this and this is something
I learned in part from social knits

408
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:42,880
and apart from y'all I that the way
that you set the world straight is by

409
00:14:42,881 --> 00:14:46,090
constraining the malevolence
in your own heart.

410
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,440
And that's no joke,

411
00:14:47,441 --> 00:14:47,741
man.

412
00:14:47,741 --> 00:14:50,980
That's no easy thing and
that's a good voyage,

413
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:54,110
people to go on if they want something
difficult and worthwhile to do.

414
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:56,840
So thank you very much.

415
00:14:58,330 --> 00:14:58,880
Okay,

416
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,320
just a quick thing.

417
00:15:00,530 --> 00:15:00,920
Uh,

418
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:03,110
we're not going to have
time for pictures so you're,

419
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:04,250
unless you're,

420
00:15:04,251 --> 00:15:05,510
yours is the last question.

421
00:15:05,690 --> 00:15:05,961
Okay.

422
00:15:05,961 --> 00:15:07,550
So sorry to everybody else,

423
00:15:07,551 --> 00:15:08,690
but you're the last one.

424
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:09,703
Okay.

425
00:15:14,090 --> 00:15:14,300
Hi,

426
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:14,870
doctor said,

427
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:15,610
thanks for coming.

428
00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:15,980
Uh,

429
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:20,090
my question is a little bit off
topic from everything else tonight,

430
00:15:20,091 --> 00:15:22,040
but I really wanted to hear
what you had to say about it.

431
00:15:22,070 --> 00:15:22,500
Um.
