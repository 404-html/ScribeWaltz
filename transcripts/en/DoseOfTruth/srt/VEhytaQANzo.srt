1
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:12,090
The first proposition that they make is
that we should treat the reality that

2
00:00:12,091 --> 00:00:13,860
we're dealing with as psychologists.

3
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:16,290
We should treat human experiences,

4
00:00:16,291 --> 00:00:17,124
that reality.

5
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:22,140
And so the reality for you
from a phenomenological
perspective is everything you

6
00:00:22,141 --> 00:00:22,921
experienced,

7
00:00:22,921 --> 00:00:25,140
they assume everything
you experience is real.

8
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:28,530
And they also assume that you can't
actually get more real than that.

9
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:30,240
And so your consciousness,

10
00:00:30,241 --> 00:00:30,951
whatever that is,

11
00:00:30,951 --> 00:00:34,320
is real and your dreams are real and
your emotions are real and your pain is

12
00:00:34,321 --> 00:00:35,010
real,

13
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:38,790
which is a really useful thing to think
if you want to make sure that you're not

14
00:00:38,791 --> 00:00:39,840
going to hurt people.

15
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:40,231
You know,

16
00:00:40,231 --> 00:00:43,230
you kind of have to think that maybe
fake pain should be treated as a

17
00:00:43,231 --> 00:00:45,270
fundamental reality instead of as an APP.

18
00:00:45,271 --> 00:00:47,520
That phenomena of some material substrate.

19
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:49,530
And so that's their first perspective.

20
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:52,710
And they took that from Heidegger
because Heidegger thought that western

21
00:00:52,711 --> 00:00:54,660
philosophy had gone off,

22
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:56,130
got off on the wrong track,

23
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:56,490
you know,

24
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:57,750
3000 years ago.

25
00:00:58,120 --> 00:00:58,620
Um,

26
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:03,000
because we didn't really concentrate on
being itself as the fundamental mystery.

27
00:01:03,001 --> 00:01:06,570
And so the fundamental mystery is
why the hell is there anything?

28
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:10,830
And since there is
something experiential Ba,

29
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:12,870
what are its fundamental elements?

30
00:01:12,871 --> 00:01:14,880
And so that's the phenomenological stats.

31
00:01:14,881 --> 00:01:15,390
It's,

32
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:16,170
it's completely,

33
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:20,460
it's not the same as a scientific approach
because it starts with a different

34
00:01:20,461 --> 00:01:21,300
presupposition.

35
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:21,901
You know,

36
00:01:21,901 --> 00:01:23,520
the scientific presupposition,

37
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:28,610
roughly speaking is that things are the
objectively real elements of things are

38
00:01:29,581 --> 00:01:31,170
the most real elements.

39
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:35,730
And there's no sense complaining about
that because it's a approach that works

40
00:01:35,731 --> 00:01:37,230
tremendously well for many,

41
00:01:37,231 --> 00:01:40,440
many things including making
hydrogen bonds for example.

42
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:43,170
But it's also reasonable to think that,

43
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:44,790
well it might not be the,

44
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,760
it might not be the whole truth
and nothing but the truth.

45
00:01:47,761 --> 00:01:52,350
And maybe you could also suspect that
the fact that we can manufacture hydrogen

46
00:01:52,351 --> 00:01:54,510
bonds also might indicate
that there's something,

47
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:57,360
a trifle off with our
fundamental belief systems,

48
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:59,160
scientific though they may be.

49
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:01,650
And that was certainly something
that concerned Heidegger,

50
00:02:01,651 --> 00:02:03,630
even though he got all
tangled up with the Nazis.

51
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:08,730
So the phenomenologists were trying to
take a part experience as such and they

52
00:02:08,731 --> 00:02:11,950
made some some hypotheses
and then some observation.

53
00:02:11,951 --> 00:02:16,951
So the first is that we're going to assume
that your experience like experience

54
00:02:17,011 --> 00:02:19,020
itself is real.

55
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:23,250
Now you just because dreams
are real and pain is real,

56
00:02:23,251 --> 00:02:23,970
it doesn't mean,

57
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:28,290
and like objects that we can all perceive
our real doesn't mean you should put

58
00:02:28,291 --> 00:02:29,730
them all in the same category.

59
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:34,940
Like my dreams are not in
the same category of reality
as this table because you

60
00:02:35,551 --> 00:02:38,580
don't have access to my dreams
and you have access to the table.

61
00:02:38,581 --> 00:02:42,000
But that doesn't mean that my dreams and
my pains and my emotions aren't real.

62
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:43,260
They're real.

63
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:44,071
So that's the first.

64
00:02:44,071 --> 00:02:44,450
Now I,

65
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:46,050
you should know that this is a,

66
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:48,630
this is a proposition.

67
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:54,260
What they're saying is let's act as if
that's true and then worked from those

68
00:02:55,231 --> 00:02:56,670
premises and see what happens,

69
00:02:56,671 --> 00:02:57,870
see where we can get with it.

70
00:02:57,871 --> 00:02:58,591
And that that's,

71
00:02:58,591 --> 00:03:01,900
that's a reasonable thing to do
because at the bottom of a theory,

72
00:03:01,901 --> 00:03:02,734
you also have,

73
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:07,330
you always have to put an
assumption because otherwise
your theory would be 100%

74
00:03:07,331 --> 00:03:09,700
right and would cover
everything and it doesn't.

75
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:12,730
So you have to throw an assumption
somewhere in there at the bottom and say,

76
00:03:12,731 --> 00:03:12,971
okay,

77
00:03:12,971 --> 00:03:13,630
we're not,

78
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:14,860
we're not questioning that.

79
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:16,120
That's the starting point.

80
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:20,500
So you have to do that
because you're ignorant.

81
00:03:20,501 --> 00:03:21,640
You don't have a full theory.

82
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:27,100
So they don't like the idea that
mind can be reduced to matter.

83
00:03:27,101 --> 00:03:28,360
They're not playing that game.

84
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:32,860
They're not playing the game that the
subject is only up phenomenal and the

85
00:03:32,861 --> 00:03:33,850
object is real.

86
00:03:33,851 --> 00:03:35,170
They don't play in that game either.

87
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:39,220
And it's partly because as
bosses without a subject,

88
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:43,930
nothing at all would exist to confront
objects and to imagine them as such.

89
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:45,191
True.

90
00:03:45,191 --> 00:03:46,720
This implies that every object,

91
00:03:46,721 --> 00:03:50,710
everything objective is merely objective
in being merely objectivize by the

92
00:03:50,711 --> 00:03:53,680
subject is the most
subjective thing possible.

93
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,430
It's a radical claim,

94
00:03:57,431 --> 00:03:58,180
you know,

95
00:03:58,180 --> 00:03:58,721
but here's,

96
00:03:58,721 --> 00:03:59,860
here's something to think about.

97
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,220
When I look at that code,

98
00:04:03,221 --> 00:04:08,221
can you might say how I
perceive the object and then
I make inferences about its

99
00:04:09,461 --> 00:04:12,250
use and then I evaluate
it and then I use it.

100
00:04:12,251 --> 00:04:12,671
And you know,

101
00:04:12,671 --> 00:04:14,680
that is not actually what you do.

102
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:16,023
In fact,

103
00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:18,970
it's not obvious at all that
what you perceive our objects.

104
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:20,860
And if you think about it,

105
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:21,551
well,

106
00:04:21,551 --> 00:04:26,551
people weren't perceiving
scientific objects until
like 1,514 50 so there was no

107
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:32,440
objective object before that.

108
00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:38,010
So obviously whatever we were perceiving
was not precisely that because we would

109
00:04:38,891 --> 00:04:40,330
have been scientists right off the bat,

110
00:04:40,331 --> 00:04:43,720
George Kelly claimed that
people were natural scientists.

111
00:04:43,721 --> 00:04:44,230
You know,

112
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:47,500
that we're always investigating hypothesis
and trying to disprove them and so

113
00:04:47,501 --> 00:04:47,711
on.

114
00:04:47,711 --> 00:04:50,560
And it's an interesting theory
and that it's right in a sense.

115
00:04:50,561 --> 00:04:52,060
But fundamentally it's wrong.

116
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:55,540
We are not natural scientists
were natural engineers.

117
00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:57,250
And when we look at the world,

118
00:04:57,310 --> 00:04:58,450
we don't see objects.

119
00:04:58,451 --> 00:04:59,740
And then in further use,

120
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:02,440
what we actually see is the use.

121
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:03,851
So for example,

122
00:05:03,851 --> 00:05:04,511
when I look at that,

123
00:05:04,511 --> 00:05:05,344
coke can,

124
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:06,010
my,

125
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:09,370
my visual system activates
my motor cortex directly.

126
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:13,480
It can do that without me seeing the
dam can consciously to some degree,

127
00:05:13,570 --> 00:05:15,160
because there are people with blind sight.

128
00:05:15,161 --> 00:05:16,510
I've told you about those people,

129
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:17,890
they say they can't see.

130
00:05:17,891 --> 00:05:20,080
But if you ask them which
hand do you have held up,

131
00:05:20,081 --> 00:05:21,100
they can tell you.

132
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,800
So they might not be able to see.

133
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:27,880
But they can map patterns from their
visual system onto their motor output.

134
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:28,301
You know?

135
00:05:28,301 --> 00:05:32,380
And that's basically what Piaget said
we do when we deal with the world,

136
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:33,670
we're embodied creatures,

137
00:05:33,671 --> 00:05:34,240
you know?

138
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,150
And so what we see when we
look around aren't objects.

139
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:40,240
They're things we can use and
things that get in our way.

140
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:41,261
You know,

141
00:05:41,261 --> 00:05:45,610
and that's a theory that
was derived originally from
Jj Gibson who wrote a great

142
00:05:45,611 --> 00:05:49,540
book on that called the visual approach
to ecological ecological approach to

143
00:05:49,541 --> 00:05:50,560
visual perception.

144
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:54,070
And his science is a brand of pragmatism.

145
00:05:54,071 --> 00:05:56,650
And the pragmatists basically
claim that you know,

146
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:02,080
things including theories and perceptions
have a limited range of truth and the

147
00:06:02,511 --> 00:06:03,344
truth that,

148
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:03,671
that,

149
00:06:03,671 --> 00:06:08,390
that the limited range of
truth is determined by the
match between your actions

150
00:06:08,391 --> 00:06:09,111
and outcomes.

151
00:06:09,111 --> 00:06:10,730
So I think this is a coke can,

152
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,260
is that what it is?

153
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,190
No,

154
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:16,160
but it's good enough for me if I want
to drink a bit of coke out of it.

155
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:20,630
God only knows what it is.

156
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:21,620
You know,

157
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:25,580
if you go into communist China and
you start advertising these things,

158
00:06:26,910 --> 00:06:27,780
then what are they?

159
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,420
Cause this thing tells a story,

160
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:31,500
right?

161
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:32,880
What's the story like?

162
00:06:32,881 --> 00:06:33,241
Really?

163
00:06:33,241 --> 00:06:34,380
Do you need Coca Cola?

164
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:35,340
No,

165
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:37,470
it's like it's a bit of Frippery,

166
00:06:37,471 --> 00:06:37,741
you know,

167
00:06:37,741 --> 00:06:38,230
it's a bit of,

168
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:39,810
it's not unnecessary luxury.

169
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:41,340
It's not even very good for you,

170
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:44,490
but it's kind of fuzzy and it's
sweet and you get to buy it.

171
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:45,870
And why is that?

172
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:49,470
Because no matter how stupid you
are and your nutrition choices,

173
00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:51,480
as far as our society goes,

174
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:56,400
you have the right to poison yourself
in whatever way you think best fits you.

175
00:06:56,730 --> 00:07:00,630
And so when you send this little
coke can off to communist China,

176
00:07:00,631 --> 00:07:03,900
this thing screams stupid
individuality all over.

177
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:06,750
And God only knows how
it undermines the state.

178
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:07,441
You know?

179
00:07:07,441 --> 00:07:08,010
And if you don't,

180
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:09,240
if you're not thinking about that,

181
00:07:09,241 --> 00:07:10,074
you're not thinking.

182
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:12,690
Think about what happens
when we export cars.

183
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,280
What does the car say?

184
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:16,503
It says,

185
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,433
Hey,

186
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:19,510
you can go wherever you want,

187
00:07:19,511 --> 00:07:20,081
whenever you want.

188
00:07:20,081 --> 00:07:23,350
You don't have to tell anybody at all
and you can do it in a really dangerous

189
00:07:23,351 --> 00:07:24,520
high speed manner.

190
00:07:25,450 --> 00:07:27,700
It's like you want a political statement,

191
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:30,070
wrap it up in metal and
ship that thing off.

192
00:07:30,071 --> 00:07:30,840
And everybody goes,

193
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:31,480
Whoa,

194
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,010
I really liked to have one of those.

195
00:07:33,011 --> 00:07:33,430
It's like,

196
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:34,180
poof,

197
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:36,250
communism disappears with that.

198
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:37,270
You know,

199
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:41,320
there's nothing that says
individuality and capitalism,

200
00:07:41,321 --> 00:07:43,510
like a personal automobile.

201
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:44,111
You know?

202
00:07:44,111 --> 00:07:47,680
You even get to pollute the atmosphere
and ruin the planet with the damn thing.

203
00:07:47,681 --> 00:07:48,330
But you know,

204
00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:51,340
if you have to drive to the corner
store and pick up your damn coke,

205
00:07:51,341 --> 00:07:52,960
it's like to hell with the atmosphere.

206
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:53,300
Okay.
