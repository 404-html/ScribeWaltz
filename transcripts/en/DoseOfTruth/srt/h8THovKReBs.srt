1
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:36,320
[inaudible] [inaudible]

2
00:05:56,650 --> 00:05:59,670
[inaudible] just turn around and

3
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,350
you're all ready to go.

4
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:04,620
Okay,

5
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:05,420
cool.

6
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:07,070
Next two minutes we'll start

7
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:22,483
off

8
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,300
by

9
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:26,560
the presence of the free speech busters

10
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,540
activism and advocacy on campus.

11
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:41,820
Know he was thrust into the
spotlight a couple years ago

12
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:47,390
and since then

13
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:53,303
she

14
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:58,013
leaves

15
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:13,353
the

16
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:15,093
stage

17
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:25,270
[inaudible]

18
00:08:57,810 --> 00:08:58,643
thank you very much.

19
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:10,070
I'm going to get right into it.

20
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:13,190
I signed those costs.

21
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:27,740
[inaudible] [inaudible]

22
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:37,310
[inaudible] so I'm going
to walk through my talk.

23
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:49,510
I'll see if I can touch on it probably
won't happen cause I usually get

24
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,010
partway through

25
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:57,930
and I'll start with rule one

26
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:01,680
which is stand up straight
and your shoulders back.

27
00:10:01,681 --> 00:10:06,681
And I'm actually just start by talking
about a different book in the last couple

28
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:11,190
of weeks by Walter shy
daily as degree level.

29
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:13,290
I would really recommend
this book by the way,

30
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:15,133
Mine,

31
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:16,620
I can recommend another one.

32
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:23,720
The reason I bought this book was
because I had this client in my clinical

33
00:10:23,821 --> 00:10:24,211
practice.

34
00:10:24,211 --> 00:10:25,440
He was a fascinating guy.

35
00:10:25,441 --> 00:10:30,240
He's an old guy and he comes to me because
he was thinking you're obsessed with

36
00:10:30,241 --> 00:10:30,861
mathematics,

37
00:10:30,861 --> 00:10:32,090
that you couldn't get it out of his mind.

38
00:10:32,091 --> 00:10:34,380
And he had some other issues as well.

39
00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:35,363
And uh,

40
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:35,900
you know,

41
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:37,170
all sorts of interesting things.

42
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:41,310
He made these little gold pennies out
of the world's most beautiful equation

43
00:10:41,311 --> 00:10:42,144
that needs to happen.

44
00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:44,140
Um,

45
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:47,070
and he had studied psychology
and he was studying finance.

46
00:10:47,071 --> 00:10:48,210
And I learned,

47
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:53,300
I think I learned more from him in my
dealings with him in the therapeutic

48
00:10:53,461 --> 00:10:55,440
context that he learned from me.

49
00:10:55,710 --> 00:10:58,280
That's not that rare if
you're clinical psychologist,

50
00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:00,123
you know,

51
00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:03,930
if you're talking to people need to leave
the probability that you're going to

52
00:11:03,931 --> 00:11:05,830
learn something from an unbelievable.

53
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:11,220
And so I think probably if you're not
learning something from the clients every

54
00:11:11,221 --> 00:11:12,210
time we talk to them,

55
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:16,830
then you're probably not on the right
track from a therapeutic perspective.

56
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:22,460
And I kind of alluded to
that in rural rule nine,

57
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:25,440
which is assumed that the person that
you're listening to know something you

58
00:11:25,441 --> 00:11:25,801
don't,

59
00:11:25,801 --> 00:11:26,910
which is a very good rule.

60
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:28,050
Anyways,

61
00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:32,010
he introduced me to this thing
I've talked about an awful lot,

62
00:11:32,011 --> 00:11:36,230
which was a principal derived choir
telling economists can feel afraid of

63
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:36,781
Horatio.

64
00:11:36,781 --> 00:11:41,781
And Creator was the person who
formulated the Credo principle,

65
00:11:42,211 --> 00:11:43,980
which is that it's a very,

66
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:45,540
it's a very terrible principal,

67
00:11:46,570 --> 00:11:51,010
the principal about tough
cause you have 10 employees,

68
00:11:51,011 --> 00:11:53,760
ten three of them do have
to work with principal.

69
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:54,633
Fundamentally,

70
00:11:55,060 --> 00:12:00,060
the square root reason will seems to
apply every single domain where there's

71
00:12:00,251 --> 00:12:03,020
creative variability in human endeavor,

72
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:07,090
but also seems also to apply to
domains outside of human endeavor.

73
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:12,150
And even even living in general together
can applies to the occupation of cities

74
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:14,350
and the massive stars for example,

75
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:19,720
which means it seems to make it a
principle that goes beyond well,

76
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:22,750
certainly be on the sociological
beyond the biological.

77
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,490
It's grounded deeply into the,

78
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:26,080
into the physical.

79
00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:27,870
And anyways,

80
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:29,590
the square root dog goes
something like this.

81
00:12:29,591 --> 00:12:33,400
So the square root of the number of
people in a given domain who half the

82
00:12:33,401 --> 00:12:34,234
productive work.

83
00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:38,450
And so our Repatha Repatha think,

84
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:39,100
well,

85
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:39,371
all right,

86
00:12:39,371 --> 00:12:40,300
if you have 10 employees,

87
00:12:40,301 --> 00:12:41,121
then three of them who have,

88
00:12:41,121 --> 00:12:41,770
who works,

89
00:12:41,770 --> 00:12:42,790
that's not that surprising.

90
00:12:43,090 --> 00:12:43,930
You have 10 employees.

91
00:12:43,931 --> 00:12:46,130
One of them is probably
not doing that well.

92
00:12:46,131 --> 00:12:47,500
And now the two are sort of,

93
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:48,220
you know,

94
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:49,150
dragging their feet.

95
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:52,960
Number three might be making enough money
to pay their wages and then you have

96
00:12:52,961 --> 00:12:53,794
three that are

97
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:57,820
productive enough so that they're
pretty running the entire enterprise.

98
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:00,160
So three out of 10 that's not too bad.

99
00:13:00,430 --> 00:13:05,430
That's not that much less than 50% but
if it's 10 of them do have the doctor

100
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:07,990
Bergman thousand days,

101
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:08,691
30 minutes,

102
00:13:08,691 --> 00:13:09,461
it's 10,000 dead.

103
00:13:09,461 --> 00:13:10,294
It's a heightened,

104
00:13:10,770 --> 00:13:11,231
I mean that's,

105
00:13:11,231 --> 00:13:16,231
so what happens is an
enterprise is competence grows
linearly and in competence

106
00:13:18,261 --> 00:13:19,390
grows exponentially.

107
00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:21,731
Right?

108
00:13:21,731 --> 00:13:22,031
Right.

109
00:13:22,031 --> 00:13:22,864
And this is like,

110
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:25,870
you just cannot overstate
the seriousness of this.

111
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:27,520
It's absolutely,

112
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:32,440
it's all why I think that starting
tower of Babel exists in the end of the,

113
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:33,301
of chapter one,

114
00:13:33,301 --> 00:13:35,170
that the first part of genesis,

115
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,810
if something gets too big
and will absolutely collapse,

116
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:41,920
and the reason for that is
that competence grows linearly,

117
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:43,480
incompetence grows exponentially.

118
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:45,630
So your member in 2008 everyone said,

119
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:46,510
too big to fail.

120
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:47,343
It's like no.

121
00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:50,410
So big it must fail.

122
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:54,300
And I think this is actually a place
where the right and the left could agree.

123
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,080
If they got the owner
partisan differences,

124
00:13:56,081 --> 00:13:57,820
because of course the right is very,

125
00:13:57,821 --> 00:14:01,480
very suspicious of big
government and the left is very,

126
00:14:01,481 --> 00:14:04,480
very suspicious of big
government and you might think,

127
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:04,870
ah,

128
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:05,290
sorry,

129
00:14:05,290 --> 00:14:07,930
big business and you
might think someone can,

130
00:14:07,931 --> 00:14:09,010
he would stand back and say,

131
00:14:09,011 --> 00:14:09,410
well look,

132
00:14:09,410 --> 00:14:12,410
the common denominator
there seems to be big.

133
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:16,030
That's very much worth 20 and up.

134
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:17,350
Now this old guy,

135
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:21,010
he told me about the credo prints
going if it solve the problem that I

136
00:14:21,011 --> 00:14:22,330
encountered in my research,

137
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:25,540
I was doing research with Shelly
Carson and Daniel Higgins.

138
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:26,530
Um,

139
00:14:26,530 --> 00:14:29,980
we started this research at Harvard in
the 90s and we were very interested in

140
00:14:29,981 --> 00:14:33,370
the measure of creative on
creativity and creativity.

141
00:14:33,371 --> 00:14:38,080
Like many what commonly
you lies descriptive terms.

142
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:41,710
It's very difficult to nail down from a
scientific perspective because to nail

143
00:14:41,711 --> 00:14:43,750
down something from a
scientific perspective,

144
00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:46,480
you really have to put
it in a categorical box,

145
00:14:46,481 --> 00:14:46,691
right?

146
00:14:46,691 --> 00:14:47,410
You can't,

147
00:14:47,410 --> 00:14:48,850
if I use the word creativity,

148
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,950
creativity in normal conversation,

149
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:54,350
you can pick up what I mean from
the context of the conversation.

150
00:14:54,351 --> 00:14:56,630
But if I make a measure of creativity,

151
00:14:56,631 --> 00:14:57,411
then it has to be very,

152
00:14:57,411 --> 00:14:59,010
very tightly defined.

153
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:01,650
And it turns out if I'm in
something like creativity,

154
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:03,200
it's a little more difficult
than you might think.

155
00:15:03,201 --> 00:15:03,770
So,

156
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:05,930
because one of the things
you could say as well,

157
00:15:06,410 --> 00:15:07,790
people think creatively,

158
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:09,560
maybe you're a creative thing.

159
00:15:09,890 --> 00:15:11,120
Is that creativity?

160
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:12,111
Well,

161
00:15:12,111 --> 00:15:12,651
are you ready to take?

162
00:15:12,651 --> 00:15:12,771
Well,

163
00:15:12,771 --> 00:15:13,041
no,

164
00:15:13,041 --> 00:15:14,030
that's not enough.

165
00:15:14,810 --> 00:15:17,390
Creativity isn't merely the
ability to think creatively.

166
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:22,190
You have to produce something
that's novel and useful,

167
00:15:22,191 --> 00:15:22,600
which is,

168
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:24,200
which is a fairly common definition.

169
00:15:24,201 --> 00:15:24,681
Creative,

170
00:15:24,681 --> 00:15:26,900
creative people produce things
that are novel and useful.

171
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:30,620
There were quite a few
measures of creative thinking
already established in the

172
00:15:30,621 --> 00:15:31,730
psychometric literature.

173
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:37,220
One of them is the Torrance
creativity test is pretty widely used.

174
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:38,473
It's actually a pretty,

175
00:15:38,530 --> 00:15:39,570
pretty good predictor of,

176
00:15:39,610 --> 00:15:41,510
of creative endeavor as it turns out.

177
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,430
So with the Torrance tests,

178
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:44,010
uh,

179
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:45,260
you're asked for example,

180
00:15:45,261 --> 00:15:48,920
to write down as many uses as
you can think of for a brick.

181
00:15:48,921 --> 00:15:50,240
And I think it's five minutes.

182
00:15:50,241 --> 00:15:51,860
I don't remember the exact amount of time.

183
00:15:51,861 --> 00:15:55,280
And then your score for
absolute number of responses,

184
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:56,480
the more the better.

185
00:15:56,570 --> 00:15:58,190
That's a straight fluency measure.

186
00:15:58,191 --> 00:15:59,420
That's called a fluency measure.

187
00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:04,070
And then the other thing that you're
scored on is relative rarity of your

188
00:16:04,071 --> 00:16:05,120
response.

189
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:09,050
As long as it still fits within the
domain of both novel and useful.

190
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,930
And so that would be creative thinking.

191
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:17,210
Fluency measures are also visions of
extraversion and trade openness from the

192
00:16:17,211 --> 00:16:18,170
big five perspective.

193
00:16:18,170 --> 00:16:20,240
And so you can tell like if you go,

194
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:21,980
if I got all four folks,

195
00:16:22,050 --> 00:16:22,940
400 of you here,

196
00:16:22,941 --> 00:16:26,810
if I all had you write down as many words
as you can that begin with the letter

197
00:16:26,811 --> 00:16:28,810
s in 90 seconds and we write orders,

198
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:30,380
you buy how many words you generated,

199
00:16:30,570 --> 00:16:34,790
you get a rough rank order of your
creativity as well and some estimation of

200
00:16:34,791 --> 00:16:35,810
your verbal intelligence.

201
00:16:35,811 --> 00:16:37,640
But it would be a better
measure of creativity,

202
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:42,380
at least creative thinking and creative
creative thinkers think laterally.

203
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:45,960
And so what happens is you're afraid
thinker is you'll have an idea and then it

204
00:16:45,961 --> 00:16:47,750
will give rise to a bunch of other ideas.

205
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:49,940
So you have loose association networks.

206
00:16:49,941 --> 00:16:51,290
That's another way of thinking about,

207
00:16:51,650 --> 00:16:51,861
you know,

208
00:16:51,861 --> 00:16:53,000
someone who is not creative.

209
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:55,130
If you've tossed them an idea,

210
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:58,250
another idea will rapidly spring to mind.

211
00:16:58,280 --> 00:16:59,330
Or if it does,

212
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:03,050
it'll be an idea that's quite close
semantically to the original idea.

213
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:04,760
Whereas if you're a creative person,

214
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:06,530
you'll hit hit hidden idea,

215
00:17:06,531 --> 00:17:09,680
new junk way over here and that will
remind you something way over here and

216
00:17:09,681 --> 00:17:11,450
that'll remind you of
something way over here.

217
00:17:11,890 --> 00:17:12,460
Um,

218
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:14,630
and a lot of creative
thinking is bad thinking.

219
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:15,873
You know,

220
00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:18,483
I mean,

221
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:22,070
it's an important thing to know if you're
a creative person because it's really

222
00:17:22,071 --> 00:17:23,480
hard to monetize creativity,

223
00:17:23,650 --> 00:17:23,900
right?

224
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:24,250
If it's the,

225
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:24,621
first of all,

226
00:17:24,621 --> 00:17:26,410
most of your ideas are back there.

227
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:30,950
You haven't criticized come
even if they're good ideas,

228
00:17:30,970 --> 00:17:34,880
the probability that there's a market
for them is quite low at that time and in

229
00:17:34,881 --> 00:17:35,714
that place.

230
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:36,231
And like,

231
00:17:36,231 --> 00:17:37,760
what do you know about marketing anyways?

232
00:17:37,761 --> 00:17:39,180
And then you have to
communicate with them.

233
00:17:39,430 --> 00:17:44,430
Like it's really the pathway from creative
idea to profitable creative product

234
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:49,440
is so long that it's almost never
that the originator of a creative idea

235
00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:50,520
monetize it.

236
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:54,300
And so that's a very dismal proposition
for people who are creative.

237
00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:55,020
Um,

238
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:58,740
it's very like creative people
generate all the new ideas.

239
00:17:58,770 --> 00:17:58,981
Right?

240
00:17:58,981 --> 00:18:01,590
But they hardly ever monetized
other people monetize.

241
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:02,170
No,

242
00:18:02,170 --> 00:18:02,581
it's a real,

243
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:03,331
it's a hell of a thing.

244
00:18:03,331 --> 00:18:05,700
Can be a creative person
except that it's interesting.

245
00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:06,670
Anyways.

246
00:18:06,670 --> 00:18:10,220
[inaudible]

247
00:18:10,270 --> 00:18:13,050
it's interesting if you'd have an
interesting life if you're a creative for

248
00:18:13,051 --> 00:18:13,471
maybe two.

249
00:18:13,471 --> 00:18:14,304
Interesting.

250
00:18:15,890 --> 00:18:16,723
So,

251
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:17,131
okay.

252
00:18:17,131 --> 00:18:19,440
So when we have new studied,

253
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:21,480
so we decided to study
creative achievement.

254
00:18:21,481 --> 00:18:22,740
We put together this questionnaire,

255
00:18:22,741 --> 00:18:25,680
it's called the creative
achievement questionnaire.

256
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,033
And we got,

257
00:18:27,330 --> 00:18:32,330
what we did was we identified
13 dimensions of potential
creative production and

258
00:18:32,641 --> 00:18:34,230
things like a culinary,

259
00:18:34,231 --> 00:18:35,220
architectural,

260
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:36,271
entrepreneurial,

261
00:18:36,271 --> 00:18:38,040
financial dance,

262
00:18:38,041 --> 00:18:38,820
drama,

263
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:40,110
Art Literature,

264
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:41,520
etc. Um,

265
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,860
I think there was an intention category.

266
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:45,053
Anyways,

267
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:47,640
we've covered the creative domains pretty,

268
00:18:47,850 --> 00:18:48,241
pretty well.

269
00:18:48,241 --> 00:18:49,560
And then we had experts,

270
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,430
we ran different,

271
00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:52,800
uh,

272
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:53,401
what would you call it?

273
00:18:53,401 --> 00:18:54,820
Strata of accomplishment.

274
00:18:54,821 --> 00:18:56,100
So zero would be,

275
00:18:56,190 --> 00:18:59,220
I have no training or
recognized talent in this area.

276
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,480
And like 10,

277
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:03,240
I think it was up 10 point scale would be,

278
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:03,541
you know,

279
00:19:03,541 --> 00:19:07,170
I won an international prize
for my find work in this area.

280
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:09,840
And then we gave it to many,

281
00:19:09,841 --> 00:19:10,171
many,

282
00:19:10,171 --> 00:19:10,860
many people.

283
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:12,840
And look at Iq as a predictor.

284
00:19:12,841 --> 00:19:14,460
Iq is a very good predictor by the way,

285
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:17,790
Iq predicts almost everything
that involves complex,

286
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:23,280
complex cognitive operations and Iq is
the most powerful predictor of social

287
00:19:23,281 --> 00:19:24,930
scientists have ever found.

288
00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:29,760
40 anything period by a factor of
the vote for there's one exception,

289
00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:35,150
the correlation between inequality and
male homicide is about 0.9 and that's the

290
00:19:35,911 --> 00:19:38,190
highest correlation we can
do things I've ever seen.

291
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:39,930
But other than that it's Iq.

292
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:42,950
And so I came as a good predictor trait.

293
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:46,020
Openness and the big 5 cents was a
good predictor of creative ability.

294
00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:50,700
But one of the things we found was that
the distribution of creative achievement

295
00:19:50,701 --> 00:19:51,750
was not normal.

296
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:55,530
You know how a normal distribution works
is most people are at the average and

297
00:19:55,531 --> 00:19:57,000
then a few people were at the tails.

298
00:19:57,001 --> 00:19:59,140
And that applies to Iq
with a place to hike.

299
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:03,060
It applies to weight and it
applies to the big five traits.

300
00:20:03,150 --> 00:20:07,230
And there's a truism in psychology that
most phenomena are normally distributed.

301
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:09,210
A truism in statistics auction,

302
00:20:09,211 --> 00:20:11,520
but most most phenomena
are normally distributed.

303
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:16,670
But creative achievement is not normally
distributed and neither are any of the

304
00:20:16,861 --> 00:20:19,500
phenomena that are associated with
creative production in general,

305
00:20:19,501 --> 00:20:21,270
including the distribution of money.

306
00:20:21,271 --> 00:20:22,104
For example,

307
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:27,320
you know the one for Sam has tremendous
w the 1% has a disproportionate amount

308
00:20:28,021 --> 00:20:33,021
of wealth and then if you take a 1%
of the 1% they have a disproportionate

309
00:20:33,091 --> 00:20:37,740
amount of the wealth that the 1% has so
that it's something like 85 people have

310
00:20:37,741 --> 00:20:39,810
as much money as blogging
for two and a half billion.

311
00:20:40,170 --> 00:20:41,520
It's something like that and you think,

312
00:20:41,521 --> 00:20:45,700
well that's a terrible indictment of
the capitalist system and no it's not by

313
00:20:45,701 --> 00:20:46,230
the way,

314
00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:47,740
because the problem of inequality,

315
00:20:47,770 --> 00:20:48,640
which is a real problem,

316
00:20:48,641 --> 00:20:52,300
was way more serious and difficult.

317
00:20:52,450 --> 00:20:57,450
Then the problem of capitalism because
any quality is a much more fundamental

318
00:20:57,821 --> 00:21:01,780
phenomenon because it manifests itself
in all sorts of areas that have nothing

319
00:21:01,781 --> 00:21:06,100
to do with sociology or politics or
economics manifest itself all everywhere

320
00:21:06,430 --> 00:21:07,090
now,

321
00:21:07,090 --> 00:21:09,600
and what we found with the creative
achievement questionnaire was everyone's

322
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:10,570
stacked up at zero.

323
00:21:11,210 --> 00:21:13,810
It's like across the 13 dimension is 70%

324
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:20,490
70% of people scored zero and
about 10% scored one and with,

325
00:21:20,491 --> 00:21:21,324
with uh,

326
00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:25,570
and you can easily score like 60 people
scored 60 on the creative achievement

327
00:21:25,571 --> 00:21:25,761
test.

328
00:21:25,761 --> 00:21:26,120
So,

329
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:27,820
but distribution look like this,

330
00:21:28,030 --> 00:21:31,870
everybody's stuck up at zero and there's
a few people out here and they were,

331
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:32,880
we never did.

332
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,030
And that you see,

333
00:21:34,031 --> 00:21:35,650
you see that the scientific applications,

334
00:21:35,651 --> 00:21:39,490
you see it in hockey goals for
number of compositions written,

335
00:21:39,491 --> 00:21:40,300
like how many of,

336
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:43,120
how many classical
compositions have you written?

337
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:44,021
Zero,

338
00:21:44,021 --> 00:21:44,854
right?

339
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:48,370
And then you have chaos js,

340
00:21:48,371 --> 00:21:53,371
Bach who wrote so many classical
compositions than if you hired a cop,

341
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:58,690
competent copyist just
to copy what he composed,

342
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:01,330
it would take them 40
years of eight hour days.

343
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:02,960
So that's what Jay was talking.

344
00:22:02,970 --> 00:22:03,880
And then castle,

345
00:22:03,881 --> 00:22:04,300
here's a,

346
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:05,260
here's an example.

347
00:22:05,410 --> 00:22:06,310
So the castle,

348
00:22:06,311 --> 00:22:07,310
you're no potassium.

349
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:08,140
Well that's for sure.

350
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:08,973
How many payments?

351
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:10,300
Zero.

352
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:13,210
How many paintings did
Picasso Painting say artworks?

353
00:22:13,211 --> 00:22:13,841
How many art first?

354
00:22:13,841 --> 00:22:18,630
Who could counsel produce 65,000 right?

355
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:19,810
So three a day.

356
00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:22,030
Every day for 65 years.

357
00:22:22,870 --> 00:22:23,260
Right?

358
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:23,981
And think about this,

359
00:22:23,981 --> 00:22:25,900
just absolutely feel income.

360
00:22:25,930 --> 00:22:30,930
And these were the castle's
right [inaudible] he's
whipping off some sketches.

361
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:33,641
He's like,

362
00:22:33,641 --> 00:22:36,190
no [inaudible] go online.

363
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:36,971
You can go online,

364
00:22:36,971 --> 00:22:41,740
you can find me online and
capacity archive and there's
15,000 of his pieces of

365
00:22:41,741 --> 00:22:42,100
art.

366
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:42,933
Last I checked,

367
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:43,900
which was a couple of years ago,

368
00:22:43,901 --> 00:22:45,450
it was probably like 20,000 hours.

369
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:46,960
And it's just staggering.

370
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:47,221
You know,

371
00:22:47,221 --> 00:22:50,140
you just cannot believe that
someone could possibly do that.

372
00:22:50,141 --> 00:22:52,090
And really that's the way of the world.

373
00:22:52,091 --> 00:22:53,620
And so this old guy,

374
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:58,460
he told me about the premium
distribution and that blew me away,

375
00:22:58,510 --> 00:23:01,910
get so many bad explained the creative
achievement questionnaire distribution

376
00:23:01,911 --> 00:23:04,540
because we didn't know like what the
hell this is supposed to be normally

377
00:23:04,541 --> 00:23:05,374
distributed.

378
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:06,343
It's not even,

379
00:23:06,530 --> 00:23:07,330
it doesn't,

380
00:23:07,330 --> 00:23:08,910
it's not normally distributed.

381
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:09,311
It all.

382
00:23:09,311 --> 00:23:10,970
Everybody stacks up at Xerox,

383
00:23:11,290 --> 00:23:11,980
which is,

384
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:16,980
which is like a rule to remember is the
proclivity is for everyone to stack up

385
00:23:17,021 --> 00:23:18,810
at zero spree and well,

386
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:19,350
why?

387
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:19,470
Well,

388
00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:20,201
zero is easy,

389
00:23:20,201 --> 00:23:21,034
right?

390
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:22,090
You just don't have anything.

391
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:25,240
But that's the natural state of
things is we don't have anything.

392
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:27,080
And so it's not surprising,

393
00:23:27,081 --> 00:23:28,330
just people that have like zero.

394
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:30,970
What's surprising is
that some people don't.

395
00:23:31,390 --> 00:23:35,500
And then what else is surprising is how
unbelievably hyper productive type of

396
00:23:35,501 --> 00:23:36,640
productive people are.

397
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:38,950
It's just beyond belief.

398
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:39,880
I mean,

399
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:40,713
Nikolai,

400
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:43,211
yeah,

401
00:23:43,211 --> 00:23:47,660
make light cast off and we get to the
alternating who invented alternating

402
00:23:47,661 --> 00:23:52,100
current that African [inaudible] invented
the electric motor and the electric

403
00:23:52,101 --> 00:23:52,790
generator.

404
00:23:52,790 --> 00:23:54,260
I'm not on any lists,

405
00:23:54,290 --> 00:23:55,400
other inventions.

406
00:23:55,820 --> 00:24:00,820
He said that whole inventions would
pop into his mind in one burst,

407
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,520
right down to the angle of the screws,

408
00:24:05,190 --> 00:24:07,010
the screws that held
the mechanisms together.

409
00:24:07,130 --> 00:24:11,570
And sometimes he would invent things so
quickly that he couldn't get one written

410
00:24:11,571 --> 00:24:14,690
down before another coffee
into his head and the win rate,

411
00:24:14,691 --> 00:24:17,330
the previous one and Mozart as well,

412
00:24:17,390 --> 00:24:18,223
um,

413
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:22,190
quiet and Mozart was a little more
understandable because he was unbelievably

414
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:24,740
highly trained by his father
as well as people prodigy.

415
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:28,400
But he said whole symphonies would talking
to these head at once and it was just

416
00:24:28,401 --> 00:24:29,450
a matter of writing it down,

417
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:30,211
you know?

418
00:24:30,211 --> 00:24:31,044
And so,

419
00:24:31,430 --> 00:24:33,200
so great achievement is really something,

420
00:24:33,410 --> 00:24:34,580
it's not like we understand it,

421
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:36,320
but it's rare.

422
00:24:36,830 --> 00:24:40,070
And the people who are really good
at it are prolific beyond belief.

423
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:40,730
You know?

424
00:24:40,730 --> 00:24:43,160
So when you hear about the
1% coming on the money,

425
00:24:43,910 --> 00:24:44,271
you think,

426
00:24:44,271 --> 00:24:46,770
well that's a side effect
of some pathological system.

427
00:24:46,771 --> 00:24:47,031
It's like,

428
00:24:47,031 --> 00:24:47,390
no,

429
00:24:47,390 --> 00:24:47,571
no,

430
00:24:47,571 --> 00:24:48,404
no,

431
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:49,370
don't get,

432
00:24:49,370 --> 00:24:52,070
don't get over simplified about
yes it's a big problem now.

433
00:24:53,010 --> 00:24:53,320
Anyways,

434
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:54,081
so this old guy,

435
00:24:54,081 --> 00:24:54,590
he said,

436
00:24:54,590 --> 00:24:55,111
he said,

437
00:24:55,111 --> 00:24:55,944
God,

438
00:24:56,430 --> 00:24:59,210
he explained to me part
of the reason staff,

439
00:24:59,690 --> 00:25:00,523
um,

440
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:04,390
the freedom distribution emerged
stay with regards to money.

441
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:05,450
And so it's,

442
00:25:05,450 --> 00:25:09,290
it's complicated and this is why Walter
Chandelle is a book is also extremely

443
00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:10,150
useful.

444
00:25:10,150 --> 00:25:10,700
I mean,

445
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:15,650
one of the things that seems to happen
is that Iq has nonlinear effects.

446
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:18,440
So as you can imagine why that might be,

447
00:25:18,530 --> 00:25:21,950
because if you're the first
person to get somewhere then,

448
00:25:22,610 --> 00:25:23,690
except if you're creative,

449
00:25:23,691 --> 00:25:26,240
but if you're the first
person to get somewhere,

450
00:25:26,450 --> 00:25:30,260
then you're more likely to
benefit disproportionately
from getting cause you're

451
00:25:30,261 --> 00:25:31,250
the first person.

452
00:25:31,790 --> 00:25:33,140
And so if you're there,

453
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:34,370
if you have a high Iq,

454
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:36,290
then you're faster than everyone else.

455
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:40,040
And then if you align that also with the
fact that you're going to network with

456
00:25:40,041 --> 00:25:41,150
other high Iq people,

457
00:25:41,151 --> 00:25:43,580
which is exactly what's happening
in Silicon Valley for example,

458
00:25:43,581 --> 00:25:47,210
then that starts to become
exponentially more worthwhile.

459
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:51,450
And that's the thing too is that this
is also associated with the premium

460
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:51,981
distribution.

461
00:25:51,981 --> 00:25:54,530
There's another kind of
iron law of economics,

462
00:25:54,531 --> 00:25:56,330
which is very sad law.

463
00:25:56,570 --> 00:25:57,403
They often,

464
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:00,260
they called the Matthew principal often,

465
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:01,880
which is an illusion,

466
00:26:02,030 --> 00:26:04,040
oddly enough to a new testament statement.

467
00:26:04,041 --> 00:26:07,580
And the New Testament statement is to
those who have everything more will be

468
00:26:07,581 --> 00:26:10,400
given and from those who have nothing,

469
00:26:10,401 --> 00:26:11,390
everything will be taken.

470
00:26:12,350 --> 00:26:14,570
And that sort of aligned with
another new testament statement,

471
00:26:14,571 --> 00:26:17,270
which is the poor will be with us always.

472
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:18,583
And for those are,

473
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:19,633
those are pretty,

474
00:26:19,970 --> 00:26:21,680
those are pretty strange statements for,

475
00:26:21,681 --> 00:26:24,020
for for what purports to
be an ethical document.

476
00:26:24,021 --> 00:26:24,670
But,

477
00:26:24,670 --> 00:26:27,530
but I think what they do is to
point to something that's very,

478
00:26:27,531 --> 00:26:31,640
very deep about the way that wealth
is folk generate that distributed.

479
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:37,040
And so there's nonlinear advantages
to say having a higher Iq,

480
00:26:37,041 --> 00:26:40,760
there's potentially nonlinear
advantages to having higher rates of

481
00:26:40,761 --> 00:26:41,720
conscientiousness.

482
00:26:42,050 --> 00:26:45,750
There's potentially nonlinear
effects to being creative thinker,

483
00:26:46,350 --> 00:26:48,630
but then once you start being successful,

484
00:26:49,310 --> 00:26:51,020
you might think you start
being successful at,

485
00:26:51,021 --> 00:26:54,180
and then it's a linear trend
upwards or you start failing.

486
00:26:54,190 --> 00:26:55,530
It's a linear trend downwards,

487
00:26:55,531 --> 00:26:56,310
but that doesn't,

488
00:26:56,310 --> 00:26:57,061
it doesn't look like it.

489
00:26:57,061 --> 00:27:00,360
Graphs that with it looks like
as you started being successful,

490
00:27:00,390 --> 00:27:03,330
each success makes the
next success more probable.

491
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:06,780
So it looks like this
and there's your fail.

492
00:27:06,781 --> 00:27:09,330
Each failure makes the next
family or more probable.

493
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:10,560
So it looks like this.

494
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:11,453
So there's,

495
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:12,300
there's,

496
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:16,680
there's scaling up on one side rapid if
there's falling off a cliff on the other

497
00:27:16,681 --> 00:27:17,400
side,

498
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:19,230
equally rapid and so,

499
00:27:19,590 --> 00:27:20,310
and so that's,

500
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:21,060
that's the magic.

501
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:24,930
That's discipline and those
things offering together
seem to produce this Prieto

502
00:27:24,931 --> 00:27:25,591
distribution.

503
00:27:25,591 --> 00:27:27,270
And the problem with
the Credo distribution,

504
00:27:27,690 --> 00:27:30,540
as mark pointed out 120 years ago,

505
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:34,230
he thought it was attributable to
capitalism is the capital say hence to

506
00:27:34,231 --> 00:27:37,290
accumulate in the hands of
fewer and fewer individuals.

507
00:27:37,770 --> 00:27:39,660
Now march was right about that.

508
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:40,920
Frito had already figured that out.

509
00:27:40,921 --> 00:27:43,080
I think predo predated marks,

510
00:27:43,081 --> 00:27:44,760
although I'm not
absolutely certain of that.

511
00:27:45,370 --> 00:27:45,541
I'm,

512
00:27:45,541 --> 00:27:47,060
I'm hoping that it's true many reasons,

513
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:49,513
but,

514
00:27:49,870 --> 00:27:52,620
but march wasn't pessimistic
and come on and they left.

515
00:27:52,621 --> 00:27:56,100
Wingers aren't pessimistic enough
theaters because of course what drives

516
00:27:56,101 --> 00:27:58,630
politics on the left is the observation.

517
00:27:58,631 --> 00:28:03,300
So inequality and a potentially
catastrophic if texted
inequality and there are

518
00:28:03,301 --> 00:28:05,850
potentially catastrophic
effects of inequality.

519
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:08,640
That's the date that's
also well documented.

520
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:10,590
So if you're a good social scientist,

521
00:28:10,591 --> 00:28:12,520
you should know something
about the credo distribution.

522
00:28:12,521 --> 00:28:15,840
You need to know something about the
fact that creative achievement is a

523
00:28:15,841 --> 00:28:16,980
nonlinear process,

524
00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:18,030
will success.

525
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:21,480
You should know something about the fact
that Iq predicts lifetime performance

526
00:28:21,690 --> 00:28:22,890
as does conscientiousness,

527
00:28:22,891 --> 00:28:24,210
although not nearly as well.

528
00:28:24,610 --> 00:28:25,443
Um,

529
00:28:25,890 --> 00:28:29,070
and then there's this proclivity for
success to Cascadian for failure to

530
00:28:29,071 --> 00:28:29,820
cascade.

531
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:31,140
But you should also know that.

532
00:28:31,850 --> 00:28:36,240
And I think this is credible evidence
that as inequality increases,

533
00:28:36,241 --> 00:28:37,110
as it seems to do,

534
00:28:37,111 --> 00:28:40,380
getting Zuora societies
themselves to stabilize.

535
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:45,420
So I mentioned earlier the
two correlations that I
know of that are very large.

536
00:28:45,421 --> 00:28:48,300
What is Iq predicting life
success and the other ways,

537
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:49,733
um,

538
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:52,740
Martha Wilson and Mark Daley.

539
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:53,220
Yeah.

540
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:54,450
Have your master university.

541
00:28:54,451 --> 00:28:58,420
These are the first people who discovered
this is shocking research when it's on

542
00:28:58,430 --> 00:29:01,890
it because I'd never seen anything that
was this powerful and in the social

543
00:29:01,891 --> 00:29:02,670
sciences.

544
00:29:02,670 --> 00:29:04,820
So they were interested in
electronic mail on the song,

545
00:29:05,550 --> 00:29:07,560
and I had studied aggression.

546
00:29:07,561 --> 00:29:09,690
Males will make me also more aggressive,

547
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:10,710
aggressive than females.

548
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:12,930
And I'll talk about that a little while.

549
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:15,210
It's not a huge difference by the way.

550
00:29:15,211 --> 00:29:18,870
So if you picked a random woman at Orenda
man of the population and you had to

551
00:29:18,871 --> 00:29:21,590
bet on who is more aggressive
and you've bet on the band,

552
00:29:21,630 --> 00:29:23,220
you'd be right 60% of the time.

553
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:26,640
So there's a huge amount of overlap
between men and women with regards to

554
00:29:26,641 --> 00:29:27,474
depression.

555
00:29:27,690 --> 00:29:29,640
And this is another thing
you might want to understand.

556
00:29:29,730 --> 00:29:31,310
It's really important to understand this,

557
00:29:31,311 --> 00:29:31,471
this,

558
00:29:31,471 --> 00:29:36,130
the two groups can be very similar
with walking differences at the tails.

559
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:36,991
So here,

560
00:29:36,991 --> 00:29:37,830
here's an example.

561
00:29:38,550 --> 00:29:39,390
So let's say

562
00:29:40,990 --> 00:29:42,520
the overlap between men and women.

563
00:29:42,521 --> 00:29:44,860
This is substantial with
regards to depression.

564
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:48,490
But let's say we don't care
about aggression except
when we're talking about the

565
00:29:48,491 --> 00:29:51,930
person who's the most
aggressive out of 100 can.

566
00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:54,220
You can imagine that would be the
case because you don't really care if

567
00:29:54,221 --> 00:29:57,070
someone's aggressive as long as they
don't come into your house with the gun,

568
00:29:57,460 --> 00:29:57,701
right?

569
00:29:57,701 --> 00:29:59,080
They can be pretty damn aggressive,

570
00:29:59,081 --> 00:30:03,610
but when they cross that line into
outright aggressive criminality,

571
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:07,690
then they'd hit a threshold and that
threshold essentially means incarceration.

572
00:30:07,870 --> 00:30:08,591
So you might say,

573
00:30:08,591 --> 00:30:09,220
well,

574
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:12,970
what proportion of men are
the most aggressive people?

575
00:30:13,030 --> 00:30:15,880
And then after that it's something like
nine out of 10 it depends on how you

576
00:30:15,881 --> 00:30:16,770
slice it August thing,

577
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:19,240
but the more aggressive the slice,

578
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:23,530
the higher the proportion
of men and that's why 910
people in prison are manner.

579
00:30:23,710 --> 00:30:26,740
Even though on average men and women
don't give her that much aggression.

580
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:28,750
And so it's really important as well.

581
00:30:28,930 --> 00:30:32,200
It should be taught basic statistics,

582
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:34,270
somewhat sophisticated I would say,

583
00:30:34,271 --> 00:30:34,810
but,

584
00:30:34,810 --> 00:30:38,500
but that kind of statistics needs to be
taught to people that junior high and

585
00:30:38,501 --> 00:30:41,770
high school because otherwise you can't
understand easily the way the world

586
00:30:41,771 --> 00:30:42,041
works.

587
00:30:42,041 --> 00:30:45,340
You can't understand how men and
women can be mostly the same,

588
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:49,270
but they can still be really different
to the extreme than a lot of activity

589
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:50,500
occurs at the extremes.

590
00:30:50,860 --> 00:30:54,850
You can say the same thing about men
in engineering and women in nursing.

591
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:58,390
So the evidence on this is
becoming increasingly clear.

592
00:30:58,510 --> 00:30:59,343
First of all,

593
00:31:00,030 --> 00:31:00,863
um,

594
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:04,360
the more gender equal the state,

595
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:08,170
the bigger the difference in
interest between men and women.

596
00:31:09,060 --> 00:31:12,790
Now it's exactly the opposite of what
social scientists assume they talking 25

597
00:31:12,791 --> 00:31:13,181
years ago.

598
00:31:13,181 --> 00:31:15,730
Cause we assume everyone
assumed that whole,

599
00:31:15,731 --> 00:31:20,210
perhaps as you made societies more
gender neutral in their sociological

600
00:31:20,230 --> 00:31:21,063
structures,

601
00:31:21,070 --> 00:31:24,010
that personality differences between them,

602
00:31:24,011 --> 00:31:25,090
the women's would be creased.

603
00:31:25,150 --> 00:31:25,990
That's over happened.

604
00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:26,230
Okay.

605
00:31:26,230 --> 00:31:27,063
Maximize.

606
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:30,910
And it's because you take all
the environmental variability
out of the equation,

607
00:31:30,911 --> 00:31:33,830
you're left with nothing about
biological variability and maximizers.

608
00:31:34,270 --> 00:31:39,270
And so there's new paper that was just
posted today on exactly this topic

609
00:31:39,401 --> 00:31:43,540
showing them the most general neutral
countries have the biggest differences in

610
00:31:43,541 --> 00:31:44,560
educational choice.

611
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:49,210
And so it's really interesting and UCR
damn government keeps rattling the cage

612
00:31:49,211 --> 00:31:53,050
votes stem fields and about how the fact
that women are underrepresented in stem

613
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,950
means that there's sociological bias.

614
00:31:55,060 --> 00:31:55,660
All the wives,

615
00:31:55,660 --> 00:31:57,430
by the way in terms of
hiring the freezers,

616
00:31:57,431 --> 00:31:59,380
dispatch deals is in favor of women.

617
00:31:59,381 --> 00:32:04,381
Now the empirical data on
that is absolutely crystal
clear and so whatever is

618
00:32:04,601 --> 00:32:08,920
driving the difference in hiring and
theirs isn't undergraduate rates of

619
00:32:08,921 --> 00:32:13,720
graduation item and it's not proficiency
because if you look at proficiency in

620
00:32:13,721 --> 00:32:16,480
mathematical reasoning
and scientific ability,

621
00:32:16,810 --> 00:32:19,330
mathematical reason in particular
among junior high kids,

622
00:32:19,510 --> 00:32:20,400
women and manner,

623
00:32:20,430 --> 00:32:24,910
there are girls and boys
basically indistinguishable
and if you follow up high

624
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:27,910
achieving women from junior high who have,

625
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:30,940
who are disproportionately
intelligent mathematics,

626
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:34,050
what happens is they don't
go into mathematics or into
the stem fields because

627
00:32:34,070 --> 00:32:34,903
the known interested in it.

628
00:32:35,170 --> 00:32:38,410
It's not because they are
pretty important thing to know,

629
00:32:38,411 --> 00:32:38,760
right?

630
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:41,100
It differences in ability
that's driving this,

631
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:44,090
it's difference in interest and the
difference in interests between men and

632
00:32:44,091 --> 00:32:48,470
women are the biggest psychometric
differences that we know of between the

633
00:32:48,471 --> 00:32:49,250
genders,

634
00:32:49,250 --> 00:32:50,330
bigger than personality,

635
00:32:50,331 --> 00:32:50,810
different stuff.

636
00:32:50,810 --> 00:32:51,291
For example,

637
00:32:51,291 --> 00:32:56,291
which are also big enough
to have walloping affects
FFA also going off after you

638
00:32:56,331 --> 00:32:57,500
get the average.

639
00:32:57,860 --> 00:32:58,460
So anyways,

640
00:32:58,460 --> 00:32:59,420
back to this old guy,

641
00:32:59,830 --> 00:33:00,663
he um,

642
00:33:01,790 --> 00:33:02,420
he,

643
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:05,960
he said to me he'd been thinking a lot
about the previous just reaching in.

644
00:33:05,961 --> 00:33:06,920
His theory was

645
00:33:09,410 --> 00:33:11,710
there are a lot of factors that drive the,

646
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:14,780
the distribution of wealth because
he was most concerned about well,

647
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:20,040
but what happens is that as a society
ratchets forward the proclivity for wealth

648
00:33:21,081 --> 00:33:25,610
distributed self on equally nonce and
mounts and mounts and mounts until there's

649
00:33:25,611 --> 00:33:30,611
so many people stacked up at zero that
they flip the board over because zero is

650
00:33:32,271 --> 00:33:34,670
a very difficult place to escape from.

651
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:35,301
You know,

652
00:33:35,301 --> 00:33:38,930
you can fall into a poverty trap where
you're so poor that nothing you do gets

653
00:33:38,931 --> 00:33:39,560
you going,

654
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:40,850
it can't get any traction.

655
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:44,660
You kind of know that if you had just
tried to start a business because the

656
00:33:44,661 --> 00:33:45,320
hardest,

657
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:47,750
the most difficult customer
to find for your businesses,

658
00:33:47,751 --> 00:33:50,900
the first customer is
disproportionately difficult.

659
00:33:51,050 --> 00:33:51,920
Once you find one,

660
00:33:51,921 --> 00:33:53,030
the second one is way easier.

661
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:56,360
And once you have a hundred it's like all
of the hundred and first is relatively

662
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:57,050
simple.

663
00:33:57,050 --> 00:33:59,060
But that first paying customer,

664
00:33:59,450 --> 00:33:59,751
yeah,

665
00:33:59,751 --> 00:34:00,740
good luck with that.

666
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,150
It's virtually impossible.

667
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:04,040
So his idea was that

668
00:34:05,650 --> 00:34:06,270
the,

669
00:34:06,270 --> 00:34:07,990
Oh and I can tell you other,

670
00:34:08,090 --> 00:34:09,890
some other interesting
things about this too,

671
00:34:10,190 --> 00:34:13,730
he turned me on to the work of a group
of people called economy physicists.

672
00:34:13,731 --> 00:34:16,230
And I talking to what
quantum physicists is,

673
00:34:16,250 --> 00:34:17,360
those people don't exist.

674
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:20,570
You can go look on,

675
00:34:20,630 --> 00:34:23,990
you can go look online and they have
interesting animations to be a quantum

676
00:34:23,991 --> 00:34:24,531
physicist.

677
00:34:24,531 --> 00:34:26,210
And one of the things they do here,

678
00:34:26,211 --> 00:34:27,044
and here's a way of,

679
00:34:27,050 --> 00:34:29,870
of imagining how wealth
distributes itself.

680
00:34:30,410 --> 00:34:34,060
So imagine that I gave
everybody in the room $10 okay,

681
00:34:34,061 --> 00:34:37,550
so you all have $10 and so you're
at a state of maximum equality,

682
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:38,220
right?

683
00:34:38,220 --> 00:34:42,170
And now you start to engage in a trading
game and it's a simple trading game.

684
00:34:42,530 --> 00:34:43,340
You,

685
00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:43,650
you,

686
00:34:43,650 --> 00:34:45,790
you just go up to someone
and you flip a coin.

687
00:34:45,850 --> 00:34:47,270
If it's heads,

688
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:52,360
then you buy a fictitional banana from
them and eat it and you give them adult.

689
00:34:54,110 --> 00:34:56,220
And so you walk away with
nine and they walk away,

690
00:34:56,290 --> 00:34:58,190
let them and you just keep trading.

691
00:34:58,760 --> 00:34:59,001
Okay?

692
00:34:59,001 --> 00:35:03,930
So what happens first is that there
are a stack managing the Grep.

693
00:35:04,010 --> 00:35:08,960
Everyone's stacked up a $10 now he's
starting to trade just as many people when

694
00:35:08,961 --> 00:35:09,794
as lose.

695
00:35:09,950 --> 00:35:11,740
So you get a normal distribution first.

696
00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:14,840
But then after 10 bad trades,

697
00:35:14,841 --> 00:35:19,250
some poor sucker has 10 tales
in row and then they hit zero.

698
00:35:19,970 --> 00:35:21,290
But what happens when you hit zero,

699
00:35:22,130 --> 00:35:22,911
you're own the game,

700
00:35:22,911 --> 00:35:23,270
man,

701
00:35:23,270 --> 00:35:24,103
you're done.

702
00:35:24,470 --> 00:35:26,330
And so then everyone keeps trading.

703
00:35:26,331 --> 00:35:27,051
So what happens?

704
00:35:27,051 --> 00:35:27,231
Well,

705
00:35:27,231 --> 00:35:30,680
that distribution starts to turn it
from a normal distribution of this tail

706
00:35:30,681 --> 00:35:34,760
starts to stack up as people
stack up at zero zero was mom,

707
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:38,430
and then the number of people who are
winning the get smaller and smaller and

708
00:35:38,431 --> 00:35:39,090
smaller,

709
00:35:39,090 --> 00:35:40,300
the one person has all the mind.

710
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:42,840
Now you know that because
you've played an awful

711
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:44,700
right.

712
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:46,140
That's what happens to monopoly game.

713
00:35:46,230 --> 00:35:49,860
If the game is over when
one person wins everything.

714
00:35:50,370 --> 00:35:51,400
And so you can mark,

715
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:54,330
this is such a robust phenomenon
that you've been put online,

716
00:35:54,350 --> 00:35:55,900
but you can get along with them.

717
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:56,993
Monopoly game.

718
00:35:57,210 --> 00:35:58,920
And so we really do understand this now.

719
00:35:58,921 --> 00:35:59,754
The problem is,

720
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:02,260
or the problem that my old clients,

721
00:36:02,261 --> 00:36:07,261
they bought the problem with regards to
the proclivity of money to distribute

722
00:36:08,030 --> 00:36:10,590
itself in that manner with
reverse feed on a physicist.

723
00:36:10,591 --> 00:36:12,120
So that was one of the
graphs they produced.

724
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:16,260
They also showed that money tends to
distribute itself and the society and can

725
00:36:16,261 --> 00:36:20,190
be worn by the same equations as gas
distributing itself into a vacuum.

726
00:36:20,790 --> 00:36:23,730
That's another example of how
fundamental a problem this is.

727
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:28,880
This is a fundamental problem and it
can't be wait hand waved away with some

728
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,180
reference to the vagaries
and political systems.

729
00:36:33,570 --> 00:36:34,403
So,

730
00:36:34,650 --> 00:36:35,880
so that was his,

731
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:40,920
his hypothesis is that all the game
kept going until two few people won

732
00:36:40,921 --> 00:36:41,401
everything.

733
00:36:41,401 --> 00:36:44,550
And then there'd be a revolution
because the people at the bottom,

734
00:36:44,551 --> 00:36:46,710
especially the angry young males,

735
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:50,370
because they're very status conscious
and if they can't live themselves off the

736
00:36:50,371 --> 00:36:54,720
bottom rung and they're not interesting
to women and so they're not in the

737
00:36:54,721 --> 00:36:55,371
dating game,

738
00:36:55,371 --> 00:36:56,340
the main game at all.

739
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,990
And that makes them hyper aggressive.

740
00:36:58,170 --> 00:37:01,740
And that's what's driving the correlation
between male homicide and inequality.

741
00:37:01,741 --> 00:37:02,760
Which is about 0.9,

742
00:37:02,761 --> 00:37:03,241
as I said.

743
00:37:03,241 --> 00:37:04,720
So if you go to counties across,

744
00:37:04,890 --> 00:37:07,710
this is between countries and
within countries by the waist.

745
00:37:07,711 --> 00:37:09,060
Absolutely robust data.

746
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:12,450
And so what you find is if you go
places where everyone's pouring,

747
00:37:12,451 --> 00:37:13,260
the men are quiet.

748
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:15,660
And if you go places where
everyone's rich but then aren't fine.

749
00:37:15,930 --> 00:37:19,270
But if you both places where there's this
steep gradient between rich and poor,

750
00:37:19,271 --> 00:37:21,630
so neighborhoods that are
mixed economic with that say,

751
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:23,910
then the male homicide
rates starts to ratchet up.

752
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:29,100
And you can imagine that it's the most
aggressive males by temperament that get

753
00:37:29,130 --> 00:37:32,800
most aggressive soonest
as inequality gets crazy.

754
00:37:32,801 --> 00:37:34,590
So there's still the
psychological component,

755
00:37:34,591 --> 00:37:37,170
but what's driving it
fundamentally is inequality.

756
00:37:37,650 --> 00:37:40,080
And so the reason we're not,

757
00:37:40,081 --> 00:37:40,590
when I first,

758
00:37:40,590 --> 00:37:42,810
that was Martin Daly
and Marco Wilson's work,

759
00:37:42,811 --> 00:37:45,540
they're both Canadian traffic
McMaster and brilliant,

760
00:37:45,541 --> 00:37:46,080
brilliant,

761
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:46,913
brilliant work.

762
00:37:47,570 --> 00:37:48,000
Um,

763
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:51,210
they also demonstrated because
they studied homicides in Chicago,

764
00:37:51,211 --> 00:37:52,000
in the inner cities,

765
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:56,820
and they concluded that for a typical
inner city dweller in Chicago,

766
00:37:56,970 --> 00:38:01,200
homicide wasn't effective status move
with regards to moving yourself up the

767
00:38:01,201 --> 00:38:02,920
hierarchy because you,

768
00:38:02,921 --> 00:38:03,180
you,

769
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:04,013
you be in a,

770
00:38:04,530 --> 00:38:06,180
within race competition,

771
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:10,020
first of all because most murders occurred
within race and so most of that was

772
00:38:10,060 --> 00:38:12,590
dominance dispute and you plea bargain.

773
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:13,541
And then if it,

774
00:38:13,541 --> 00:38:14,374
if it was our,

775
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:16,060
it was the sort of fight
to turned into a murder,

776
00:38:16,070 --> 00:38:17,850
this sort of dispute that
turned into a murder.

777
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,670
You could claim self defense,

778
00:38:20,671 --> 00:38:20,881
plea,

779
00:38:20,881 --> 00:38:23,400
bargain it down to manslaughter,

780
00:38:23,620 --> 00:38:25,710
be in jail hypothetically for three years,

781
00:38:25,711 --> 00:38:29,100
but you give them after 18 months and
your street pregnant guys enough so that

782
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:31,190
it was actually a viable
economic decisions.

783
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:32,640
It's harsh modeling,

784
00:38:32,641 --> 00:38:32,860
right?

785
00:38:32,860 --> 00:38:35,710
Like real social science produces
results and if no one likes

786
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:41,200
the findings are real social
scientists and you go home.

787
00:38:41,201 --> 00:38:42,034
No,

788
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:49,750
that's why I think you've been trust in
gender data on personality by the way,

789
00:38:49,751 --> 00:38:50,770
because you know,

790
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:55,150
it's a truism that the social sciences
or are left leaning as to say the least.

791
00:38:55,180 --> 00:38:55,841
They're left leaning.

792
00:38:55,841 --> 00:39:00,841
And so the fact that social scientists
have found and gender differences in

793
00:39:00,941 --> 00:39:04,270
personality maximize any
Galitary and societies,

794
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:05,770
but that's rock solid data.

795
00:39:05,830 --> 00:39:08,980
There's no one was like having a party
when they discovered that no one was

796
00:39:08,981 --> 00:39:09,430
going to,

797
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:09,701
oh,

798
00:39:09,701 --> 00:39:11,170
that's exactly what we're hoping.

799
00:39:11,170 --> 00:39:13,130
He isn't it good to like no,

800
00:39:13,470 --> 00:39:14,350
it's like no,

801
00:39:14,410 --> 00:39:15,400
that can't be right.

802
00:39:15,580 --> 00:39:19,810
We bet in like quadrupled our
sample size and do 10 more analysis.

803
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:21,340
Oh,

804
00:39:21,340 --> 00:39:22,240
here it is again.

805
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:25,630
I guess we have to publish this.

806
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:27,050
That's the lines of thing.

807
00:39:27,110 --> 00:39:27,830
So,

808
00:39:27,830 --> 00:39:30,350
so another example of that,

809
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:31,193
I can say this,

810
00:39:31,450 --> 00:39:31,870
there was,

811
00:39:31,870 --> 00:39:34,450
this is also with regards
to the inequality is that,

812
00:39:34,490 --> 00:39:35,323
um,

813
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:38,650
I spent a lot of time
reading the ICU literature.

814
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:41,680
I started that about
20 years ago and I was,

815
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:45,190
I was reading out because while I
was interested in what predicts human

816
00:39:45,191 --> 00:39:49,390
performance across time and
a ton of Iq definitely does.

817
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:51,640
And I keep it by the way,

818
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,760
they're very easy to design.

819
00:39:55,030 --> 00:39:56,860
So I'll kind you how to make an Iq test.

820
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:57,873
It's real simple.

821
00:39:57,970 --> 00:40:01,840
So imagine that you have that
Universal Library of questions.

822
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:04,030
I don't care what type
of questions they are.

823
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:05,770
Mathematical Puzzles,

824
00:40:05,771 --> 00:40:06,640
verbal puzzles,

825
00:40:06,641 --> 00:40:07,540
general knowledge,

826
00:40:07,570 --> 00:40:08,330
vocabulary,

827
00:40:08,330 --> 00:40:12,630
like any sort of question that
someone could answer and that,

828
00:40:12,631 --> 00:40:13,900
so maybe some people couldn't.

829
00:40:13,901 --> 00:40:16,930
So then they'd have to be questions
with a certain degree of difficulty.

830
00:40:17,470 --> 00:40:20,320
So imagine you have 100,000
questions like that.

831
00:40:20,321 --> 00:40:25,321
You just throw them in a pile and then
you randomly select a hundred of them and

832
00:40:25,541 --> 00:40:30,190
then you give them to 400 people and
you tell me up their scores and you rank

833
00:40:30,191 --> 00:40:31,180
order the scores.

834
00:40:33,580 --> 00:40:34,331
Not Exactly.

835
00:40:34,331 --> 00:40:35,500
You should correct for age,

836
00:40:35,770 --> 00:40:36,730
but forget about that.

837
00:40:36,940 --> 00:40:37,780
Fundamentally.

838
00:40:37,781 --> 00:40:39,620
That's how I view and then can find.

839
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:43,210
So you took those hundred vendors
questions and you gave him never,

840
00:40:43,270 --> 00:40:44,350
when you rank ordered their,

841
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:45,010
their,

842
00:40:45,010 --> 00:40:45,843
their performance.

843
00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:51,180
Let's say you pull up another 100 and
you give them to the same 400 people and

844
00:40:51,431 --> 00:40:53,140
you produced another rank order,

845
00:40:53,310 --> 00:40:54,143
right?

846
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:56,140
And you correlated the two rank orders,

847
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:59,770
you'd find that the correlation was
about [inaudible] 93 something like that.

848
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:03,340
So the people who did really well on
the first hundred set of questions are

849
00:41:03,370 --> 00:41:07,010
overwhelmingly likely to be the people
to do very well with the second set of a

850
00:41:07,011 --> 00:41:07,810
hundred questions.

851
00:41:07,810 --> 00:41:09,520
And that's all there is to Iq.

852
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:11,560
That's the whole damn picture now.

853
00:41:12,250 --> 00:41:16,720
And then that predicts longterm
life success with enough potency.

854
00:41:16,721 --> 00:41:21,250
So imagine you were picking people for
a job and used an Iq test to pick them,

855
00:41:21,310 --> 00:41:22,510
or you chose the randomly.

856
00:41:22,810 --> 00:41:24,250
So if you didn't chose the randomly,

857
00:41:24,251 --> 00:41:28,530
it would be a 50% failure rate if he chose
them with Iq test to be a 25% failure

858
00:41:28,531 --> 00:41:29,260
rate.

859
00:41:29,260 --> 00:41:33,500
And so it's a walloping effect
and everyone knows that really,

860
00:41:33,770 --> 00:41:34,550
you know,

861
00:41:34,550 --> 00:41:36,070
you know perfectly well that

862
00:41:38,390 --> 00:41:41,570
complex cognitive operations
are easier for smart people.

863
00:41:41,990 --> 00:41:45,250
It's like that's just not that
stag when your realization never,

864
00:41:46,630 --> 00:41:49,670
we're not so happy about the corollary,

865
00:41:49,671 --> 00:41:52,610
which is the complex
cognitive operations are very,

866
00:41:52,611 --> 00:41:54,140
very difficult for people.

867
00:41:54,141 --> 00:41:54,974
Learn smart.

868
00:41:55,460 --> 00:41:56,300
We don't like that.

869
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:57,530
No wonder,

870
00:41:57,530 --> 00:41:59,450
no wonder because it's a terrible thing.

871
00:41:59,750 --> 00:42:00,860
So anyways,

872
00:42:00,861 --> 00:42:05,180
the US military has it been
doing Iq testing since like 19,

873
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:05,931
I think 19,

874
00:42:05,931 --> 00:42:07,190
19 really,

875
00:42:07,191 --> 00:42:08,024
really early.

876
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:08,991
And you think,

877
00:42:08,991 --> 00:42:09,710
well why?

878
00:42:09,710 --> 00:42:10,543
Well,

879
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:13,190
partly because during times of emergency,

880
00:42:13,191 --> 00:42:14,024
like work on

881
00:42:16,790 --> 00:42:21,790
when you have to ramp up or else then
maybe you want to figure out a way to

882
00:42:22,491 --> 00:42:25,550
select people rapidly so you can
figure out who should be officers from,

883
00:42:25,551 --> 00:42:27,140
who should be soldiers critically.

884
00:42:27,140 --> 00:42:28,910
So like you don't lose the war.

885
00:42:28,970 --> 00:42:30,350
It's actually very important.

886
00:42:31,070 --> 00:42:32,210
And so the army,

887
00:42:32,211 --> 00:42:36,260
the armed forces in the US get a lot of
Iq research and established a lot of the

888
00:42:36,261 --> 00:42:37,061
basic segment.

889
00:42:37,061 --> 00:42:37,331
You're coming,

890
00:42:37,331 --> 00:42:38,530
you're standing of Iq Cuban,

891
00:42:39,020 --> 00:42:39,853
um,

892
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:43,280
about 20 years ago might
be longer than that.

893
00:42:44,430 --> 00:42:45,140
Um,

894
00:42:45,140 --> 00:42:46,040
there was a legal,

895
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:51,240
there's a new law passed in the United
States with regards to investing in

896
00:42:51,241 --> 00:42:52,490
people into the armed forces.

897
00:42:53,670 --> 00:42:54,950
So imagine first,

898
00:42:55,430 --> 00:42:56,570
there's another example.

899
00:42:56,810 --> 00:42:58,720
Reliable social satire that hit.

900
00:42:58,730 --> 00:43:00,470
So now you run the armed forces.

901
00:43:00,830 --> 00:43:01,750
So what's your problem?

902
00:43:02,630 --> 00:43:04,280
First problem is manpower shortage,

903
00:43:04,730 --> 00:43:05,910
especially if it's wartime.

904
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:06,920
But even in these times,

905
00:43:07,100 --> 00:43:09,080
it's hard to get enough
people into the military.

906
00:43:09,590 --> 00:43:10,820
So what's your goal?

907
00:43:11,900 --> 00:43:13,670
Take everyone you possibly can.

908
00:43:13,820 --> 00:43:14,960
That's your goal,

909
00:43:14,990 --> 00:43:15,590
right?

910
00:43:15,590 --> 00:43:17,030
And let's say it's splots war type,

911
00:43:17,031 --> 00:43:18,020
that's bloody obvious.

912
00:43:18,021 --> 00:43:19,160
You want to take everyone you can.

913
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:20,420
But then there's another layer,

914
00:43:20,421 --> 00:43:20,751
which is,

915
00:43:20,751 --> 00:43:24,890
let's say it's peace time and you want
to keep the armed forces functional,

916
00:43:25,310 --> 00:43:28,400
but you also want the armed forces to
play another rule which they couldn't

917
00:43:28,401 --> 00:43:28,700
play,

918
00:43:28,700 --> 00:43:30,600
which would be to take
people from the underpass,

919
00:43:30,620 --> 00:43:30,920
right?

920
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:35,420
Things stack up at zero and trained them
to do something useful and move them

921
00:43:35,630 --> 00:43:39,380
into the working class or maybe in the
middle cloud because the armed forces for

922
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:43,670
compared to the u s that the news doesn't
ave with social mobility and logically

923
00:43:43,671 --> 00:43:44,420
so,

924
00:43:44,420 --> 00:43:44,721
okay,

925
00:43:44,721 --> 00:43:46,640
so then you have people
who are doing the research,

926
00:43:46,641 --> 00:43:48,680
who are damn motivated to take.

927
00:43:48,681 --> 00:43:53,681
Everyone may can and also to believe that
training will work because that's what

928
00:43:53,841 --> 00:43:54,261
you'd hope.

929
00:43:54,261 --> 00:43:55,370
If you're going to take every one,

930
00:43:55,371 --> 00:43:57,620
you're going to hope
that training will work.

931
00:43:57,710 --> 00:44:01,100
Obviously one of the
armed forces conclude,

932
00:44:02,690 --> 00:44:07,690
do you have an Iq of less than 83 it's
illegal to induct you into the armed

933
00:44:08,031 --> 00:44:08,864
forces.

934
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:09,260
I think.

935
00:44:09,260 --> 00:44:09,531
Well,

936
00:44:09,531 --> 00:44:10,280
so what?

937
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:10,521
Yeah.

938
00:44:10,521 --> 00:44:12,010
So what one in camp,

939
00:44:13,940 --> 00:44:14,690
right?

940
00:44:14,690 --> 00:44:15,680
So you think about that

941
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:21,800
among the most desperate
employers in the United States,

942
00:44:22,310 --> 00:44:27,310
the conclusion has been that 10% of
the population is without sufficient

943
00:44:27,681 --> 00:44:32,570
cognitive resources to do anything in a
reasonably complex cognitive department

944
00:44:32,790 --> 00:44:35,310
that isn't positively counter productive

945
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:38,690
pasture fate.

946
00:44:38,690 --> 00:44:40,740
It's a catastrophe because
you know the liberal thing,

947
00:44:41,430 --> 00:44:43,680
well we're all equal.

948
00:44:43,980 --> 00:44:46,110
You can train someone to do anything.

949
00:44:46,111 --> 00:44:46,381
It's like,

950
00:44:46,381 --> 00:44:47,040
no you can't.

951
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:47,873
That's wrong.

952
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:48,810
It's known is just wrong.

953
00:44:49,050 --> 00:44:50,570
It's a tongue believe want,

954
00:44:50,690 --> 00:44:51,390
want serious,

955
00:44:51,390 --> 00:44:51,641
serious,

956
00:44:51,641 --> 00:44:52,170
wrong.

957
00:44:52,170 --> 00:44:53,440
And then the conservative say,

958
00:44:53,630 --> 00:44:56,640
well there's a job for everybody and they
just get off your lazy ass and do it.

959
00:44:56,670 --> 00:44:57,370
It's like,

960
00:44:57,370 --> 00:44:58,203
no,

961
00:44:58,310 --> 00:44:58,671
no,

962
00:44:58,671 --> 00:45:00,020
that's no.

963
00:45:00,021 --> 00:45:04,830
I mean if you were are in the lower
quintile and cognitive ability and you're

964
00:45:04,831 --> 00:45:05,910
highly conscientious,

965
00:45:05,911 --> 00:45:06,744
you work hard,

966
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:09,690
that does increase your
chances of gainful employment.

967
00:45:10,170 --> 00:45:12,170
But there's a lot,

968
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:13,380
here's the data,

969
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:18,440
basically people with an Iq of 90
or less and that's more like one,

970
00:45:19,420 --> 00:45:20,040
four,

971
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:21,000
something like that.

972
00:45:22,260 --> 00:45:23,093
They'd be more,

973
00:45:23,490 --> 00:45:24,330
probably more,

974
00:45:25,490 --> 00:45:27,990
can't read well enough
to follow instructions.

975
00:45:29,700 --> 00:45:30,533
Right.

976
00:45:30,820 --> 00:45:32,190
I think about that cause it was like,

977
00:45:32,191 --> 00:45:33,960
I know what your
definition of literacy is.

978
00:45:34,170 --> 00:45:36,330
Literacy isn't puzzling of words,

979
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:37,260
right?

980
00:45:37,260 --> 00:45:40,740
You're not literate until you're
not a puzzling out words at all.

981
00:45:40,741 --> 00:45:42,530
You don't even puzzling on phrases,

982
00:45:42,570 --> 00:45:42,781
right?

983
00:45:42,781 --> 00:45:47,540
You've automatized your reading ability
to the point where you look at a word

984
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:48,630
instantly read him.

985
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:53,720
But even more so you glance at a phrase
and you're not fingering hook what the

986
00:45:53,761 --> 00:45:54,840
words are.

987
00:45:55,080 --> 00:45:55,860
You're,

988
00:45:55,860 --> 00:45:58,410
you're interacting with
the meaning of the words.

989
00:45:58,620 --> 00:45:58,831
Okay,

990
00:45:58,831 --> 00:46:00,090
let's call that literacy.

991
00:46:00,270 --> 00:46:00,870
Okay.

992
00:46:00,870 --> 00:46:02,430
90 Iq and below.

993
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:03,473
No.

994
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:04,830
Okay.

995
00:46:04,830 --> 00:46:05,663
So that's,

996
00:46:05,810 --> 00:46:07,360
and this is something we're point,

997
00:46:07,460 --> 00:46:11,210
I'm dwelling on this book because I'm
obsessed with the idea of inequality and

998
00:46:11,460 --> 00:46:14,760
the unequal district 12 the m Mv unequal,

999
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:15,601
what we call it,

1000
00:46:15,601 --> 00:46:17,190
a distribution of creative ability.

1001
00:46:17,550 --> 00:46:19,350
It's an obsession because
it's so important.

1002
00:46:19,650 --> 00:46:20,250
But you know,

1003
00:46:20,250 --> 00:46:24,060
the thing is just the word producing a
landscape around us cause increased rate

1004
00:46:24,061 --> 00:46:25,290
cognitively complex,

1005
00:46:25,530 --> 00:46:25,741
right?

1006
00:46:25,741 --> 00:46:29,760
Like how well are you going to do with
your damn job if you can't use you or

1007
00:46:29,770 --> 00:46:30,510
example,

1008
00:46:30,510 --> 00:46:33,090
it's like using a computer
that's not that easy.

1009
00:46:33,091 --> 00:46:33,391
You know,

1010
00:46:33,391 --> 00:46:34,800
it's not a simple thing.

1011
00:46:35,010 --> 00:46:36,480
And if you're not literate,

1012
00:46:36,550 --> 00:46:39,570
then good luck to you and
using your damn computer.

1013
00:46:40,110 --> 00:46:42,860
I had another client who he
must have had an Iq of about,

1014
00:46:43,290 --> 00:46:45,150
I would think somewhere between 70 and 80,

1015
00:46:45,390 --> 00:46:46,620
and it was just one of many,

1016
00:46:46,621 --> 00:46:47,910
many problems he had.

1017
00:46:48,270 --> 00:46:48,840
Um,

1018
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:53,840
and I tried to teach him to fold
up paper and put it in an envelope.

1019
00:46:55,160 --> 00:46:57,300
And I guess he had a
job that required down.

1020
00:46:57,310 --> 00:46:59,240
And I watched him do that.

1021
00:46:59,310 --> 00:47:02,040
Like it's really hard to fold the paper
in three and put it into an envelope

1022
00:47:02,370 --> 00:47:06,470
because the envelope is exactly the
same size as the pain with walks.

1023
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:07,313
Right?

1024
00:47:07,470 --> 00:47:08,740
It's exactly the same size.

1025
00:47:08,750 --> 00:47:10,440
So if you have a cool twice,

1026
00:47:10,441 --> 00:47:12,680
and so if you're out by two
millimeters on each fold,

1027
00:47:12,681 --> 00:47:14,130
the paper won't fit into the envelope.

1028
00:47:14,700 --> 00:47:15,420
And that's,

1029
00:47:15,420 --> 00:47:16,030
that's not,

1030
00:47:16,030 --> 00:47:17,290
it's the same in terms of,

1031
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:19,560
of the width of the folded paper.

1032
00:47:19,561 --> 00:47:19,771
Right.

1033
00:47:19,771 --> 00:47:22,650
Do you have to follow exactly in
three for it to fit in the envelope?

1034
00:47:23,100 --> 00:47:28,100
And if you have for what you call a
volunteer job where your job is to fold

1035
00:47:29,290 --> 00:47:29,730
letters,

1036
00:47:29,730 --> 00:47:30,760
put them in envelopes,

1037
00:47:31,090 --> 00:47:34,240
you have to do that precisely
and accurately at high speed.

1038
00:47:34,420 --> 00:47:34,550
Oh,

1039
00:47:34,550 --> 00:47:35,383
he couldn't do it.

1040
00:47:35,650 --> 00:47:37,210
I trained him for like 26 hours,

1041
00:47:37,211 --> 00:47:40,480
something like that and just
made me sweat like really,

1042
00:47:40,540 --> 00:47:41,373
really hard on him.

1043
00:47:41,770 --> 00:47:42,210
That was,

1044
00:47:42,210 --> 00:47:43,730
I mean he know he had a bit of a tremor.

1045
00:47:43,860 --> 00:47:44,220
You yeah.

1046
00:47:44,220 --> 00:47:45,370
Other problems as well.

1047
00:47:45,640 --> 00:47:46,600
And then it was so funny,

1048
00:47:46,840 --> 00:47:47,530
funny.

1049
00:47:47,530 --> 00:47:51,220
I mean it was impossible to find them
a job and trying to find someone to

1050
00:47:51,221 --> 00:47:51,970
volunteer job.

1051
00:47:51,970 --> 00:47:54,460
You think so try to find
someone a real job as hard.

1052
00:47:54,850 --> 00:47:55,780
You just try finding,

1053
00:47:55,910 --> 00:47:57,190
getting them on a volunteer job,

1054
00:47:57,460 --> 00:47:59,590
you have to do a police
screen for example.

1055
00:47:59,860 --> 00:48:01,600
And then we have to do
the paperwork for that.

1056
00:48:02,170 --> 00:48:02,711
So it was like,

1057
00:48:02,711 --> 00:48:04,150
forget that that wasn't happening.

1058
00:48:04,570 --> 00:48:05,920
And I sent them off.

1059
00:48:05,950 --> 00:48:07,760
This was an Ontario I sent them off to.

1060
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:11,320
There are some government agencies would
be set up under the last conservative

1061
00:48:11,380 --> 00:48:13,030
already can help people do,

1062
00:48:13,300 --> 00:48:13,541
you know,

1063
00:48:13,541 --> 00:48:18,541
we're looking for work and they have
specialists hired and he told him to Oh,

1064
00:48:18,610 --> 00:48:18,881
you know,

1065
00:48:18,881 --> 00:48:20,890
type up your resume and distributed.

1066
00:48:21,700 --> 00:48:22,031
Yeah.

1067
00:48:22,031 --> 00:48:22,864
Okay.

1068
00:48:25,290 --> 00:48:27,760
That was not helpful.

1069
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:30,273
No Tie,

1070
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:31,673
no resume.

1071
00:48:32,080 --> 00:48:33,160
That's a big problem.

1072
00:48:33,580 --> 00:48:37,090
And so there are way more people up there
like that that you think way more and

1073
00:48:37,091 --> 00:48:38,770
we do not know what to do about that.

1074
00:48:39,130 --> 00:48:43,180
And blaming it on capitalism isn't going
to help because it's not the fault of

1075
00:48:43,181 --> 00:48:44,014
capitalism,

1076
00:48:44,020 --> 00:48:48,600
but also ignoring the fact that inequality
exists and that people tend to stack

1077
00:48:48,601 --> 00:48:53,280
up at zero and that there are massive
differences in individual productivity and

1078
00:48:53,530 --> 00:48:56,830
people don't reward it
disproportionately ignoring all of that.

1079
00:48:57,430 --> 00:48:58,450
That's not gonna help either.

1080
00:48:58,990 --> 00:48:59,823
And so,

1081
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:00,191
okay,

1082
00:49:00,191 --> 00:49:00,360
so,

1083
00:49:00,360 --> 00:49:01,180
so,

1084
00:49:01,180 --> 00:49:02,020
so anyway,

1085
00:49:02,021 --> 00:49:04,750
so the oldness this old guy in this world,

1086
00:49:04,751 --> 00:49:05,710
and I talked to on that,

1087
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:06,671
first of all,

1088
00:49:06,671 --> 00:49:11,671
I couldn't believe that I had been trained
as a psychologist for like 25 years,

1089
00:49:11,711 --> 00:49:12,544
something like that.

1090
00:49:13,660 --> 00:49:15,530
It's only 15 anyways,

1091
00:49:15,690 --> 00:49:16,720
plenty long enough.

1092
00:49:17,260 --> 00:49:19,120
And I've never heard of
a premium distribution.

1093
00:49:19,120 --> 00:49:21,040
And I thought that those things
were normally distributed.

1094
00:49:21,080 --> 00:49:21,420
It's an APP.

1095
00:49:21,420 --> 00:49:22,960
It's just like a seriously wrong,

1096
00:49:23,020 --> 00:49:24,310
I couldn't believe that.

1097
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:26,440
I haven't encountered that somewhere.

1098
00:49:26,620 --> 00:49:30,220
It's still the standard speed because
it's such a fundamental phenomenon.

1099
00:49:30,670 --> 00:49:31,450
Um,

1100
00:49:31,450 --> 00:49:32,021
and his,

1101
00:49:32,021 --> 00:49:32,980
his idea was,

1102
00:49:32,981 --> 00:49:33,580
well,

1103
00:49:33,580 --> 00:49:34,330
you know,

1104
00:49:34,330 --> 00:49:37,570
inequality amounts up and then
there's revolution so well,

1105
00:49:37,571 --> 00:49:38,404
so then

1106
00:49:40,840 --> 00:49:42,070
because if you stack up at zero,

1107
00:49:42,071 --> 00:49:43,070
why not flip the board?

1108
00:49:43,240 --> 00:49:43,601
You know,

1109
00:49:43,601 --> 00:49:46,390
if you're down to your last $10 in your
playing monopoly and you're going to get

1110
00:49:46,391 --> 00:49:50,900
shocked when you lose many minds
moreover and starting to games,

1111
00:49:52,290 --> 00:49:54,910
there's just no reason to participate
when you're stuck at zero.

1112
00:49:55,300 --> 00:49:58,990
Even if there's a high chance of
mortality by playing a new game,

1113
00:49:59,230 --> 00:50:00,063
you might as well risk,

1114
00:50:00,190 --> 00:50:01,210
especially through mail.

1115
00:50:01,330 --> 00:50:05,530
And that is exactly what characterizes
the history of the human race.

1116
00:50:05,710 --> 00:50:10,710
So Chanel just book the great leveler
and I've just been working my way through

1117
00:50:11,321 --> 00:50:16,060
it and I read a description
and he basically came up
with the same theory that

1118
00:50:16,061 --> 00:50:19,420
this whole plan of mine and
come up with that inequality,

1119
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:20,390
mountain disorderly.

1120
00:50:20,470 --> 00:50:21,580
And then there's revolutions.

1121
00:50:21,581 --> 00:50:26,581
And so Chanelle went through the data
going back well as far back as you can,

1122
00:50:27,620 --> 00:50:28,760
15,000 years.

1123
00:50:28,790 --> 00:50:33,440
Sometimes even if you go back
into Neolithic burial cemeteries,

1124
00:50:34,190 --> 00:50:38,240
you can get an estimate of the dollar
value of the artifacts that are burdened

1125
00:50:38,241 --> 00:50:42,530
with people and then you can graph the
dollar value of the artifacts and you can

1126
00:50:42,531 --> 00:50:45,890
see what sort of distribution there is
and there's a pretty low distribution

1127
00:50:45,891 --> 00:50:46,724
right there.

1128
00:50:46,910 --> 00:50:50,750
You guys are like gold,

1129
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:55,040
she think and there's like one of
them in the cemetery and then there's,

1130
00:50:55,190 --> 00:50:55,491
you know,

1131
00:50:55,491 --> 00:50:56,700
a hundred people who were very good,

1132
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:58,490
absolutely nothing and so you can,

1133
00:50:58,610 --> 00:50:59,710
you can track it there.

1134
00:50:59,870 --> 00:51:02,090
He tracked it and Quality
Mark Hunter gatherers.

1135
00:51:02,360 --> 00:51:03,800
If there's no surplus,

1136
00:51:05,060 --> 00:51:06,170
there's no hunch in the pool.

1137
00:51:07,460 --> 00:51:07,851
There's still,

1138
00:51:07,851 --> 00:51:11,300
I think what would be his health was
inequality of social contacts and there's

1139
00:51:11,301 --> 00:51:15,410
any quality of sexual success even when
there's no surplus of material wealth,

1140
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:19,580
so you can't get rid of inequality
even if you get rid of surplus material

1141
00:51:19,581 --> 00:51:20,210
wealth.

1142
00:51:20,210 --> 00:51:22,460
Once you introduce
surface material wealth,

1143
00:51:22,461 --> 00:51:25,670
which you probably want to do because
otherwise everyone's living chem tomorrow.

1144
00:51:25,970 --> 00:51:28,670
Then inequality starts
wrapping up in exhort.

1145
00:51:29,390 --> 00:51:29,871
And so,

1146
00:51:29,871 --> 00:51:30,680
and that's true.

1147
00:51:30,680 --> 00:51:31,513
Now if he did it,

1148
00:51:31,550 --> 00:51:33,380
a number of very interesting analysis,

1149
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:34,670
one question was,

1150
00:51:35,630 --> 00:51:36,463
well,

1151
00:51:36,890 --> 00:51:40,910
there are continuous with tends to
ameliorate inequality across the centuries

1152
00:51:40,911 --> 00:51:41,860
across the IELTS,

1153
00:51:41,900 --> 00:51:42,560
right?

1154
00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:44,390
Because it's a fundamental problem.

1155
00:51:45,260 --> 00:51:50,260
If you analyze the relationship between
the position of a government on the

1156
00:51:51,140 --> 00:51:54,650
ideological spectrum and inequality,

1157
00:51:55,010 --> 00:51:56,630
do you find any relationship?

1158
00:51:56,780 --> 00:51:57,860
And that answer is no.

1159
00:51:58,490 --> 00:52:00,570
It doesn't matter if it's
electric government or raping.

1160
00:52:00,590 --> 00:52:03,020
Government has no effect
whatsoever on inequality.

1161
00:52:03,710 --> 00:52:04,910
No one knows what to do about.

1162
00:52:05,900 --> 00:52:08,750
And so the only thing
that Chanel on health,

1163
00:52:08,751 --> 00:52:09,500
we're four things,

1164
00:52:09,500 --> 00:52:10,720
and I don't know for rememberable,

1165
00:52:11,290 --> 00:52:12,500
he called them the four horsemen.

1166
00:52:12,710 --> 00:52:14,090
So you can imagine what they are,

1167
00:52:14,460 --> 00:52:14,900
um,

1168
00:52:14,900 --> 00:52:15,733
epidemics,

1169
00:52:17,290 --> 00:52:20,360
a violent revolution war.

1170
00:52:20,870 --> 00:52:22,790
And there's one other equally terrible.

1171
00:52:23,210 --> 00:52:24,750
So basically what Chanel farm goes,

1172
00:52:24,780 --> 00:52:26,600
but if you flattened everyone,

1173
00:52:27,380 --> 00:52:29,510
then you flat note,

1174
00:52:29,960 --> 00:52:31,010
I didn't put distribution.

1175
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:32,990
But then if you start mounting up again,

1176
00:52:33,260 --> 00:52:38,260
no evidence whatsoever that any nonviolent
or non catastrophic interventions

1177
00:52:39,020 --> 00:52:42,110
ameliorating inequality
to any measurable degree.

1178
00:52:43,100 --> 00:52:43,933
And so,

1179
00:52:44,510 --> 00:52:44,721
well,

1180
00:52:44,721 --> 00:52:46,430
so that's what Google one is about.

1181
00:52:46,730 --> 00:52:47,563
Essentially.

1182
00:52:49,860 --> 00:52:54,860
I a lot of [inaudible] things
I didn't tell you are um,

1183
00:52:58,460 --> 00:53:03,320
part of the reason that I wrote it and
taking some humorous flack and some not

1184
00:53:03,321 --> 00:53:07,280
so humorous flack about the claims that
may not go to one because I talk about

1185
00:53:07,281 --> 00:53:08,114
lobsters and

1186
00:53:10,340 --> 00:53:13,790
the reason that I talk about
lobsters this cause I was reading,

1187
00:53:14,150 --> 00:53:17,030
I read a lot of animal
experimental psychology,

1188
00:53:17,031 --> 00:53:17,864
neuroscience,

1189
00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:18,710
that sort of thing,

1190
00:53:18,710 --> 00:53:20,770
basic neuroanatomy and
functional neuroanatomy,

1191
00:53:21,950 --> 00:53:22,783
brain chemistry.

1192
00:53:23,110 --> 00:53:28,110
I'm very interested in the really solid
biological end of psychology as well as

1193
00:53:28,650 --> 00:53:32,010
the more abstract clinical
psychological theory stuff.

1194
00:53:32,030 --> 00:53:35,070
Sort of two places I've drawn
the most of what I do from.

1195
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:36,113
And uh,

1196
00:53:36,660 --> 00:53:41,660
I was reading some great papers about
crustacean nervous systems 15 years ago or

1197
00:53:41,671 --> 00:53:42,270
so.

1198
00:53:42,270 --> 00:53:45,190
And crustaceans have a pretty simple
nervous system compared to ours.

1199
00:53:45,510 --> 00:53:49,080
Fairly large neurons and so you
can back them up pretty well.

1200
00:53:49,090 --> 00:53:50,910
And I'm like a crustacean lobster.

1201
00:53:51,360 --> 00:53:53,680
It's a lot simpler than a
person neurologically speaking.

1202
00:53:53,681 --> 00:53:55,740
That's a pretty still pretty
damn complicated thing.

1203
00:53:55,750 --> 00:53:56,490
You know what I mean?

1204
00:53:56,490 --> 00:54:01,010
It believes autonomously and Hans
it can recognize friend and foe.

1205
00:54:01,011 --> 00:54:01,770
It can,

1206
00:54:01,770 --> 00:54:03,240
it knows where its burrow is.

1207
00:54:03,241 --> 00:54:03,770
Like it's,

1208
00:54:03,770 --> 00:54:07,290
it's got a very wide range
of complicated behaviors.

1209
00:54:07,291 --> 00:54:09,780
So you don't want to think
that that officers too simple.

1210
00:54:09,781 --> 00:54:10,021
I mean,

1211
00:54:10,021 --> 00:54:13,800
they've been around for somewhere
between 300 and 600 million years,

1212
00:54:13,801 --> 00:54:14,300
so,

1213
00:54:14,300 --> 00:54:14,720
you know,

1214
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:15,690
in one form or another.

1215
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:17,220
So they're doing just fine.

1216
00:54:17,430 --> 00:54:18,600
Anything that lasts that long,

1217
00:54:18,601 --> 00:54:19,500
he's not stupid

1218
00:54:21,100 --> 00:54:26,100
but monsters or organize themselves
into Iraq and while hierarchies,

1219
00:54:26,910 --> 00:54:29,880
the consequence of unequal distribution
of resources and essentially there's no

1220
00:54:29,890 --> 00:54:31,170
difference between those two things.

1221
00:54:31,171 --> 00:54:31,980
And um,

1222
00:54:31,980 --> 00:54:33,630
I was really interested in that because,

1223
00:54:34,530 --> 00:54:34,711
well,

1224
00:54:34,711 --> 00:54:37,680
because of the problem of hierarchy with
problem with inequality and the problem

1225
00:54:37,880 --> 00:54:40,290
just proportionate of production
and all of that and the fact that,

1226
00:54:40,710 --> 00:54:45,710
so I started to study the neurology
and the neuropsychology and the neuro

1227
00:54:47,540 --> 00:54:51,420
pharmacology of the systems in our
brains that govern our responses to

1228
00:54:51,480 --> 00:54:52,220
hierarchy.

1229
00:54:52,220 --> 00:54:56,640
And so this is another piece of
evidence that we can't lay hierarchy or

1230
00:54:56,641 --> 00:55:01,470
inequality or disproportionality apathy
of the political system because your

1231
00:55:01,471 --> 00:55:05,040
brain is so adaptive to hierarchy,

1232
00:55:05,250 --> 00:55:06,630
you cannot believe it.

1233
00:55:07,320 --> 00:55:09,210
So there are modules in your brain.

1234
00:55:09,930 --> 00:55:11,100
That's a good way of thinking about it.

1235
00:55:11,250 --> 00:55:14,620
Or more like the
underlying some structure,

1236
00:55:15,180 --> 00:55:19,950
like there's the foundational substructure
that's a third of a billion years

1237
00:55:19,950 --> 00:55:19,951
old,

1238
00:55:19,951 --> 00:55:21,710
which by the way is way older than treats,

1239
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:22,650
but that's old.

1240
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:24,960
You basically share it to the crustaceans.

1241
00:55:25,140 --> 00:55:27,480
So crustaceans have a
counter in their brain,

1242
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:29,500
you know that's an oversimplification,

1243
00:55:29,610 --> 00:55:32,730
but it will do to have a counter in their
brain that tells them where they are

1244
00:55:32,731 --> 00:55:33,810
in the lobster higher.

1245
00:55:34,290 --> 00:55:35,160
And if there are one,

1246
00:55:35,161 --> 00:55:37,980
which means they're very
like low level lobsters,

1247
00:55:38,330 --> 00:55:42,840
then they're kind of timid
and they crunched down and
they sneak around and they

1248
00:55:42,841 --> 00:55:45,630
don't buy to draw much attention to
itself and they're easily startled.

1249
00:55:45,810 --> 00:55:49,580
And if they come up to another was to
don't tell fuck the hell out was their,

1250
00:55:49,790 --> 00:55:50,061
their,

1251
00:55:50,061 --> 00:55:55,061
their manager is better ignored and at
the bottom then dismembered and dead

1252
00:55:57,220 --> 00:55:59,100
natural cheese in general.

1253
00:55:59,130 --> 00:56:01,410
And then the lobsters as they move up,

1254
00:56:01,411 --> 00:56:01,801
say 10,

1255
00:56:01,801 --> 00:56:02,521
10 strata,

1256
00:56:02,521 --> 00:56:05,250
lost your hierarchy to get stretch out.

1257
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:06,810
And they all cry more and more space.

1258
00:56:06,811 --> 00:56:09,840
So like two lobsters of equivalent size,

1259
00:56:10,320 --> 00:56:12,190
one who's a number one law one,

1260
00:56:12,220 --> 00:56:13,290
he's number 10 in Gloucester,

1261
00:56:13,530 --> 00:56:17,030
will occupy different amounts of area
because the number one Gloucester

1262
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:17,661
stretches out.

1263
00:56:17,661 --> 00:56:18,930
It looks bigger than he is,

1264
00:56:18,931 --> 00:56:19,680
let's say,

1265
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:21,780
because he's confident
because he's won all the time.

1266
00:56:21,990 --> 00:56:23,010
Whereas the number 10 blogs,

1267
00:56:23,080 --> 00:56:24,070
his French is down.

1268
00:56:24,550 --> 00:56:28,990
And so I thought that was very
interesting because I knew that there's an

1269
00:56:28,991 --> 00:56:33,991
analogy between human depression and
low physician in primary dominant car

1270
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:35,313
instructors.

1271
00:56:35,770 --> 00:56:36,131
So on.

1272
00:56:36,131 --> 00:56:40,690
The analogy seems to be that what
happens when you get depressed?

1273
00:56:40,990 --> 00:56:41,823
Well,

1274
00:56:41,860 --> 00:56:43,410
sometimes if you're both status,

1275
00:56:43,430 --> 00:56:44,263
you're depressed.

1276
00:56:44,620 --> 00:56:49,620
But sometimes if you're depressed you act
like the low status even though you're

1277
00:56:49,841 --> 00:56:50,470
not.

1278
00:56:50,470 --> 00:56:52,480
And that's not a bad
definition of depression.

1279
00:56:52,900 --> 00:56:56,710
And it's actually a good way of thinking
about what's happening functionally in

1280
00:56:57,040 --> 00:56:57,873
a neuro chemically.

1281
00:56:58,330 --> 00:56:59,080
And so,

1282
00:56:59,080 --> 00:57:02,580
and then I was more so that was
interesting and I found out.

1283
00:57:02,581 --> 00:57:04,810
But at the same time that in the lobster,

1284
00:57:04,811 --> 00:57:08,140
the neurochemical Serotonin
is a fundamental chemical.

1285
00:57:08,350 --> 00:57:09,730
The serotonergic system is very,

1286
00:57:09,731 --> 00:57:10,361
very ancient.

1287
00:57:10,361 --> 00:57:11,620
And when you're in Utero,

1288
00:57:11,621 --> 00:57:12,850
when your brain is getting set up,

1289
00:57:12,851 --> 00:57:17,410
the serotonin system sets it up and
it regulates your Hoshin Serotonin.

1290
00:57:17,411 --> 00:57:22,120
So in some sense what it does is determine
how much positive emotion you feel

1291
00:57:22,121 --> 00:57:24,310
compared to how much
negative emotions and no,

1292
00:57:24,311 --> 00:57:25,720
those are separate systems by the way.

1293
00:57:25,721 --> 00:57:28,780
So happiness is not the
opposite of sadness.

1294
00:57:29,080 --> 00:57:33,520
There's a system for happiness and there's
a system for sadness and they inhibit

1295
00:57:33,521 --> 00:57:33,851
each other,

1296
00:57:33,851 --> 00:57:35,140
but it's not one system.

1297
00:57:35,140 --> 00:57:39,190
So you can have very high levels of
negative emotion and very high levels of

1298
00:57:39,191 --> 00:57:39,881
positive emotion.

1299
00:57:39,881 --> 00:57:43,700
So if you pick a big tribe and you read
behind neuroticism and you're really

1300
00:57:43,720 --> 00:57:44,620
high in extroversion,

1301
00:57:44,890 --> 00:57:47,680
that you're someone who has very high
levels of big and promotion and very high

1302
00:57:47,681 --> 00:57:48,680
end up with a positive voltage.

1303
00:57:48,760 --> 00:57:49,600
So that the APP,

1304
00:57:49,930 --> 00:57:54,410
what what Serotonin does is that
as your serotonin levels increase,

1305
00:57:54,970 --> 00:57:59,670
your sensitivity to negative emotion
increases and your sensitivity deposit

1306
00:57:59,710 --> 00:58:01,690
emotion decreases.

1307
00:58:02,110 --> 00:58:04,470
And so people hate that and no wonder,

1308
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:04,720
right?

1309
00:58:04,720 --> 00:58:09,190
Like person hate that because all the
pleasure and hope goes away and all the

1310
00:58:09,191 --> 00:58:10,720
pain and the anxiety is magnified.

1311
00:58:10,990 --> 00:58:14,500
And that's proportionate to your
position and the dominance harder.

1312
00:58:14,940 --> 00:58:16,810
So as you move up your serotonin levels,

1313
00:58:16,811 --> 00:58:17,930
increasing stress out,

1314
00:58:17,931 --> 00:58:22,710
can you stand tall and proud of to say
and you're more susceptible deposit

1315
00:58:22,730 --> 00:58:25,090
motion hope and less
susceptible to negative emotion.

1316
00:58:25,300 --> 00:58:27,580
And as you plummet down
the dominance hierarchy,

1317
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:32,760
which happens if you're defeated or
humiliated or embarrassed or or promotion

1318
00:58:32,810 --> 00:58:35,110
work that you were expecting our work,

1319
00:58:35,230 --> 00:58:39,130
well you've run into one of
those situations who life
where things fall apart on

1320
00:58:39,131 --> 00:58:44,050
you serve who levels fall through droops
and your negative emotion starts to get

1321
00:58:44,051 --> 00:58:44,884
out of control.

1322
00:58:45,220 --> 00:58:46,053
And so,

1323
00:58:46,440 --> 00:58:51,440
and the fact that that it's a staggering
thing that that physio chemical

1324
00:58:52,721 --> 00:58:56,690
response has be maintained
for third of appealing ears.

1325
00:58:57,780 --> 00:58:57,971
Right?

1326
00:58:57,971 --> 00:58:58,804
And I'm sure as you,

1327
00:58:58,830 --> 00:59:02,970
and also see it also helps you understand
why people don't like humiliation and

1328
00:59:02,980 --> 00:59:04,540
lots of people don't like to public speak.

1329
00:59:04,541 --> 00:59:08,310
It's one of the most common fears work
on then the fear of death by the way.

1330
00:59:08,650 --> 00:59:11,690
And the reason that we don't like to
public speak is because while you're,

1331
00:59:11,740 --> 00:59:16,740
you're in front of a hierarchical group
and exposed to the evaluation of the

1332
00:59:16,781 --> 00:59:21,740
group and people don't like that and
well just explained why people don't like

1333
00:59:21,741 --> 00:59:23,960
it when your belief systems
are challenged either.

1334
00:59:24,450 --> 00:59:26,450
And I thought about that for a long,

1335
00:59:26,451 --> 00:59:26,841
long,

1336
00:59:26,841 --> 00:59:27,674
long time.

1337
00:59:28,070 --> 00:59:31,460
And there's one second logical theory
that's called terror management theory.

1338
00:59:31,461 --> 00:59:36,170
The idea is that you have a belief system
to make sense of things in the world

1339
00:59:36,380 --> 00:59:38,600
and as long as it remains intact,

1340
00:59:38,870 --> 00:59:40,840
then Andrew can make sense
of things in the rules,

1341
00:59:40,841 --> 00:59:44,710
then you don't feel an overwhelming
sense of existential anxiety.

1342
00:59:44,870 --> 00:59:46,760
Some one comes along Marcus,

1343
00:59:46,761 --> 00:59:50,570
about the accidents of your belief system
and you don't have an explanation for

1344
00:59:50,571 --> 00:59:52,430
things that you get
overwhelmed by anxiety.

1345
00:59:52,610 --> 00:59:55,080
And that's why people play
for the belief systems.

1346
00:59:55,100 --> 00:59:56,060
But I have a,

1347
00:59:56,760 --> 00:59:59,040
and that is that um,

1348
00:59:59,690 --> 01:00:00,523
your,

1349
01:00:00,890 --> 01:00:02,840
your competence like okay,

1350
01:00:02,841 --> 01:00:07,710
so let's say by we university professor
hypothetically that means on the slotted

1351
01:00:07,750 --> 01:00:10,340
into a dominant hierarchy
ended up pretty high levels.

1352
01:00:10,370 --> 01:00:12,200
Like being a university professors.

1353
01:00:12,440 --> 01:00:12,770
Again,

1354
01:00:12,770 --> 01:00:13,300
good job.

1355
01:00:13,300 --> 01:00:13,530
You know,

1356
01:00:13,530 --> 01:00:15,170
because it's very secure,

1357
01:00:15,740 --> 01:00:18,020
which is a good thing and
it's very prestigious.

1358
01:00:18,110 --> 01:00:22,490
So that's also a good thing now so
I can see myself in that hierarchy.

1359
01:00:22,500 --> 01:00:24,260
And was your number two
or number three position,

1360
01:00:24,261 --> 01:00:27,470
whatever it happens to be somewhere
approximately close to the top.

1361
01:00:27,770 --> 01:00:32,770
And I have a claim hold that position now
I'm a moral claim on that position and

1362
01:00:34,310 --> 01:00:35,143
hypothetically,

1363
01:00:35,180 --> 01:00:36,740
and it's a position
that other people want.

1364
01:00:36,741 --> 01:00:37,700
So it's very competitive.

1365
01:00:37,870 --> 01:00:42,500
It's any attempt to
find a high status job.

1366
01:00:42,530 --> 01:00:46,970
It's extraordinarily competitive and it's
not surprising because the prestigious

1367
01:00:46,971 --> 01:00:47,804
positions,

1368
01:00:47,870 --> 01:00:51,550
they're secure and they're economically
advantageous so and they're scarce.

1369
01:00:51,551 --> 01:00:52,790
So of course there's competition.

1370
01:00:53,420 --> 01:00:58,420
So hypothetically you win some sort
of contest in order to deal with that

1371
01:00:58,701 --> 01:01:00,060
position also.

1372
01:01:00,070 --> 01:01:01,370
What would the content be?

1373
01:01:01,580 --> 01:01:02,420
It might be,

1374
01:01:02,600 --> 01:01:07,600
well I know enough to justify being put
in that position when someone stands up

1375
01:01:08,841 --> 01:01:13,190
and the question period say it puts
me on the spot and indicates that my

1376
01:01:13,191 --> 01:01:17,210
knowledge about something is less
thorough than I might have been claiming.

1377
01:01:17,450 --> 01:01:18,021
You might say,

1378
01:01:18,021 --> 01:01:19,970
well that's shaking.

1379
01:01:19,971 --> 01:01:22,490
My belief structure could more accurately.

1380
01:01:22,491 --> 01:01:24,260
I think Britney saves that.

1381
01:01:24,380 --> 01:01:29,380
We can my moral claim to the position
in the actual hierarchy that actually

1382
01:01:31,641 --> 01:01:35,300
protects me rather than the belief
system that I use to construe the world.

1383
01:01:35,480 --> 01:01:35,691
You know,

1384
01:01:35,691 --> 01:01:38,480
like being in an actual hierarchy,

1385
01:01:38,600 --> 01:01:42,670
slotted near the talk isn't only
psychologically adventageous,

1386
01:01:42,671 --> 01:01:43,100
right.

1387
01:01:43,100 --> 01:01:44,810
It's actually advantageous.

1388
01:01:45,110 --> 01:01:46,730
It actually is more secure.

1389
01:01:46,731 --> 01:01:50,120
It actually is Bernard's economic
benefits that come along with it.

1390
01:01:50,270 --> 01:01:51,770
It is a prestigious position.

1391
01:01:51,950 --> 01:01:53,750
None of that's merely psychological.

1392
01:01:54,590 --> 01:01:57,350
And so people don't like
having their competence,

1393
01:01:57,410 --> 01:02:02,410
their incompetence displayed in public
before their peers because it threatens

1394
01:02:02,731 --> 01:02:06,380
their [inaudible] to their position
in the hierarchy and that position

1395
01:02:06,410 --> 01:02:07,820
stabilizes their emotions.

1396
01:02:08,770 --> 01:02:11,450
And so that took about
25 years to figure out

1397
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:15,950
a moral,

1398
01:02:15,950 --> 01:02:19,800
I guess the moral of the story is the
point of the story and point of the story

1399
01:02:19,801 --> 01:02:23,820
is the direction of the story and the
direction of the story has a moral

1400
01:02:23,821 --> 01:02:28,130
injunction because I'm more on junction
is go back way instead of that one.

1401
01:02:28,140 --> 01:02:28,380
Right.

1402
01:02:28,380 --> 01:02:29,220
Or maybe it's,

1403
01:02:29,550 --> 01:02:31,650
well it turns out that way is up.

1404
01:02:31,830 --> 01:02:35,250
That's actually more of a moral of junk
because my big ball and you'd like to

1405
01:02:35,251 --> 01:02:36,084
move up.

1406
01:02:36,500 --> 01:02:36,780
Well,

1407
01:02:36,780 --> 01:02:38,020
maybe you want to move down or who?

1408
01:02:38,021 --> 01:02:39,030
I wouldn't recommend that.

1409
01:02:39,140 --> 01:02:43,120
But when people do a mic down sometimes
like the kid in Florida yesterday,

1410
01:02:43,940 --> 01:02:44,700
right,

1411
01:02:44,700 --> 01:02:48,990
who was eating very seriously at
doubt and so people doing it down,

1412
01:02:48,991 --> 01:02:51,090
but you might think that
aiming it up is better,

1413
01:02:51,270 --> 01:02:52,920
but you might not know which way up there.

1414
01:02:52,930 --> 01:02:57,750
I said the moral of the story is a point
or two which way is up and each of the

1415
01:02:57,810 --> 01:03:02,100
rules in my book is a pointer to
which way is up and you know they're,

1416
01:03:02,550 --> 01:03:04,020
I wouldn't say the rules themselves,

1417
01:03:04,230 --> 01:03:05,063
particularly

1418
01:03:06,630 --> 01:03:08,100
unique or original.

1419
01:03:08,190 --> 01:03:09,810
I actually try to make them,

1420
01:03:09,870 --> 01:03:10,540
I know unique,

1421
01:03:10,540 --> 01:03:15,540
original and tried to make them rock solid
and obvious and then explain why they

1422
01:03:16,561 --> 01:03:20,850
were so necessary because
well generally speaking,

1423
01:03:20,851 --> 01:03:24,000
if something sort of self care then you
don't have much of a rationale for it.

1424
01:03:24,030 --> 01:03:24,631
You don't need it.

1425
01:03:24,631 --> 01:03:24,961
It's like,

1426
01:03:24,961 --> 01:03:29,490
well everyone knows that like well it
turns out you don't really know what you

1427
01:03:29,491 --> 01:03:31,140
just accept it because everyone else does.

1428
01:03:31,141 --> 01:03:32,310
And that's usually good enough.

1429
01:03:33,210 --> 01:03:35,130
So when in in 12 rules,

1430
01:03:35,131 --> 01:03:36,640
one of the things I suggested plus,

1431
01:03:37,500 --> 01:03:40,440
well you've got this problem of hierarchy,

1432
01:03:40,800 --> 01:03:44,460
right and the really catastrophic
consequences of failure and the

1433
01:03:44,461 --> 01:03:48,870
disproportionate advantages of success
and the stress that that puts on social

1434
01:03:48,871 --> 01:03:50,070
systems might say,

1435
01:03:50,071 --> 01:03:53,940
well we'll go for radical egalitarianism
but there's no evidence that that works

1436
01:03:53,941 --> 01:03:56,580
and plenty of evidence that
it has catastrophic outcomes.

1437
01:03:56,910 --> 01:04:00,390
And plus if you get rid of hierarchies
that you don't have any op cause one of

1438
01:04:00,391 --> 01:04:02,220
the advantages of a hierarchy as it says,

1439
01:04:02,221 --> 01:04:05,190
well a is better than B and you might say,

1440
01:04:05,191 --> 01:04:06,590
well if a is better than me,

1441
01:04:06,591 --> 01:04:10,170
then some people are better at a then
at the end then you get into quality.

1442
01:04:10,410 --> 01:04:13,080
But if nothing is better than
anything else than what the hell,

1443
01:04:13,081 --> 01:04:13,470
what do you,

1444
01:04:13,470 --> 01:04:14,303
why live,

1445
01:04:15,270 --> 01:04:15,990
right?

1446
01:04:15,990 --> 01:04:17,590
You've got to know you the way in.

1447
01:04:17,620 --> 01:04:20,400
If one thing is new better than another,

1448
01:04:20,640 --> 01:04:24,150
then you're not mistaking
depressed because he wants
to just sit there and age.

1449
01:04:24,710 --> 01:04:25,543
You know

1450
01:04:26,700 --> 01:04:27,930
what the Hell's the difference?

1451
01:04:28,510 --> 01:04:29,850
If everything is equal,

1452
01:04:29,851 --> 01:04:32,580
then there's no impetus for action.

1453
01:04:32,700 --> 01:04:34,770
This is actually a
technical truth by the way,

1454
01:04:34,771 --> 01:04:38,730
because we know how positive
emotion systems work.

1455
01:04:39,060 --> 01:04:40,110
We know a lot about them.

1456
01:04:40,111 --> 01:04:43,260
And I think the person who did the best
work on that was Jeffrey Gray who wrote

1457
01:04:43,261 --> 01:04:44,470
a book called the neuro psychology.

1458
01:04:44,471 --> 01:04:45,031
My anxiety,

1459
01:04:45,031 --> 01:04:46,740
which is on my reading list on my website,

1460
01:04:47,040 --> 01:04:47,910
but brilliant book,

1461
01:04:48,060 --> 01:04:50,400
it only take you about six months,

1462
01:04:50,401 --> 01:04:52,140
a four hour days to read.

1463
01:04:53,850 --> 01:04:58,850
He must've read 3000 scientific
papers to write that book.

1464
01:04:59,340 --> 01:05:00,480
And not only can he read them,

1465
01:05:00,570 --> 01:05:03,810
he actually read them
and the understood them.

1466
01:05:04,540 --> 01:05:08,850
You actually took the time to understand
that many synthesize them and then he

1467
01:05:08,851 --> 01:05:10,470
did an accurately and that's like,

1468
01:05:10,471 --> 01:05:11,520
that just never happens.

1469
01:05:11,790 --> 01:05:14,130
And so you just,

1470
01:05:14,131 --> 01:05:19,131
neuropsychology of anxiety has 20 years
of off rate geniuses work condensed into

1471
01:05:19,781 --> 01:05:23,740
300 pages and it's not something you can
just pick up and scan through because

1472
01:05:23,950 --> 01:05:26,260
every sentence is a learning experience.

1473
01:05:26,261 --> 01:05:29,770
But Ray did a really
nice job back in 1982.

1474
01:05:30,100 --> 01:05:30,910
Um,

1475
01:05:30,910 --> 01:05:32,920
and things have changed
to some degree since then,

1476
01:05:32,921 --> 01:05:36,370
but no law in laying out what the
function of the positive emotional system

1477
01:05:36,371 --> 01:05:39,490
while he was discussing the
neurological basis of anxiety.

1478
01:05:39,820 --> 01:05:44,820
It turns out that most of the positive
emotion that people experience is not as

1479
01:05:44,861 --> 01:05:47,260
a consequence of attaining a goal.

1480
01:05:48,250 --> 01:05:50,350
It's more a consequence of looking.

1481
01:05:50,500 --> 01:05:54,550
I'm noticing that you're moving forward
towards your goal that you desire.

1482
01:05:54,730 --> 01:05:55,720
So we have a system,

1483
01:05:56,490 --> 01:06:00,280
it's called Conservatory reward system
that makes you feel good when you get

1484
01:06:00,281 --> 01:06:00,970
something you want.

1485
01:06:00,970 --> 01:06:02,050
So for example,

1486
01:06:02,051 --> 01:06:05,170
if you sit down at Thanksgiving
and you eat the Turkey afterwards,

1487
01:06:05,171 --> 01:06:07,000
you're feeling satisfied.

1488
01:06:07,270 --> 01:06:08,650
So it's the satisfaction system.

1489
01:06:08,830 --> 01:06:11,650
You're fitting satisfied
and that's a kind of good,

1490
01:06:12,130 --> 01:06:13,540
but it's not excited,

1491
01:06:13,541 --> 01:06:14,261
hopeful ending,

1492
01:06:14,261 --> 01:06:15,100
engaged.

1493
01:06:15,340 --> 01:06:17,600
That's a whole different car
and that's a better seventh.

1494
01:06:17,620 --> 01:06:18,850
One of the motivations,

1495
01:06:19,030 --> 01:06:22,510
and we know about because people
preferentially like drugs that these,

1496
01:06:22,511 --> 01:06:26,310
that effect cocaine and amphetamine
methamphetamine does that.

1497
01:06:26,440 --> 01:06:27,400
Alcohol does that.

1498
01:06:27,401 --> 01:06:28,960
If you're predisposed to alcoholism,

1499
01:06:29,350 --> 01:06:32,380
it activates the second
motor exploratory system.

1500
01:06:32,381 --> 01:06:34,450
It's dope and dope at the near GP medium.

1501
01:06:34,510 --> 01:06:39,010
That's the dopamine system and the drugs
that people really like don't make you

1502
01:06:39,011 --> 01:06:40,120
feel satisfied.

1503
01:06:40,121 --> 01:06:42,520
So like do you sit around after
you've had a giant Turkey?

1504
01:06:42,790 --> 01:06:46,480
It make you feel like you're
doing something that makes
like life worth living.

1505
01:06:46,690 --> 01:06:50,010
And that's what cocaine does even know
cooking doesn't make like worthy of

1506
01:06:51,180 --> 01:06:53,070
provides that the simulation.

1507
01:06:53,960 --> 01:06:54,650
And so,

1508
01:06:54,650 --> 01:06:56,980
so the upshot of that is,

1509
01:06:57,130 --> 01:07:00,520
and this is a theme that is
woven throat 12 rules for life,

1510
01:07:00,521 --> 01:07:02,500
is that no goal,

1511
01:07:02,530 --> 01:07:03,220
no aim,

1512
01:07:03,220 --> 01:07:03,970
no op,

1513
01:07:03,970 --> 01:07:04,960
no hierarchy,

1514
01:07:05,170 --> 01:07:06,160
no positive emotion.

1515
01:07:07,480 --> 01:07:08,080
So that's,

1516
01:07:08,080 --> 01:07:10,860
that's something that we also were just
need to keep in mind cause hierarchies

1517
01:07:10,861 --> 01:07:12,190
have this terrible price strength,

1518
01:07:12,200 --> 01:07:14,770
which is the people
stock up with water by.

1519
01:07:14,980 --> 01:07:16,660
If there isn't a hierarchy of value,

1520
01:07:16,840 --> 01:07:18,490
so that one thing is better than another.

1521
01:07:18,970 --> 01:07:21,390
Well what the hell is all
your striking the floor?

1522
01:07:21,970 --> 01:07:24,430
And I think that it's
actually even worse than that.

1523
01:07:24,490 --> 01:07:26,710
And this is another
motif that could go to,

1524
01:07:26,800 --> 01:07:29,020
like people often ask,

1525
01:07:29,440 --> 01:07:31,090
does life have a meaning?

1526
01:07:31,690 --> 01:07:33,130
And that's actually a fairly chill,

1527
01:07:33,131 --> 01:07:38,131
formulated question because the
answer to that is self evidently yes.

1528
01:07:39,370 --> 01:07:40,210
What's the meaning?

1529
01:07:40,480 --> 01:07:42,490
Pain and anxiety.

1530
01:07:43,480 --> 01:07:44,313
Right.

1531
01:07:44,350 --> 01:07:46,610
And the reason I use
those to self evidence,

1532
01:07:46,660 --> 01:07:49,900
because even if you're a cynic,

1533
01:07:50,460 --> 01:07:51,430
like a nihilistic,

1534
01:07:51,431 --> 01:07:55,720
sending a hopeless nihilistic
Sinek that life has no meaning,

1535
01:07:56,220 --> 01:08:01,120
it's like you're wrong because
hold as you will to that theory,

1536
01:08:01,720 --> 01:08:05,830
you will still be in pain
and anxious and he might say,

1537
01:08:05,831 --> 01:08:06,760
well that's not a meaning.

1538
01:08:06,760 --> 01:08:11,260
It's like yeah actually it is
just happens to be negative,

1539
01:08:11,680 --> 01:08:12,970
but it's not neutral.

1540
01:08:13,660 --> 01:08:14,493
It's a meaning.

1541
01:08:15,140 --> 01:08:20,140
And so the question life meaning is more
like does life have meaning in spite of

1542
01:08:23,001 --> 01:08:23,834
its suffering?

1543
01:08:25,240 --> 01:08:27,020
And the answer that seems to be,

1544
01:08:29,030 --> 01:08:30,320
well it depends what you aim at

1545
01:08:31,900 --> 01:08:34,430
and if you don't need anything
then no is the answer.

1546
01:08:35,450 --> 01:08:38,440
And then the next dance was
something like you have to him.

1547
01:08:38,441 --> 01:08:43,441
And something that's so valuable that
the pursuit of it justifies the suffering

1548
01:08:46,131 --> 01:08:46,964
and the anxiety.

1549
01:08:47,750 --> 01:08:50,780
And so that actually means you need a
pretty damn steep hierarchy of values.

1550
01:08:50,990 --> 01:08:54,350
Some things have to be way better than
other things because otherwise there's

1551
01:08:54,351 --> 01:08:59,351
not enough force in their pursuit to
produce enough engagement in life to

1552
01:09:00,141 --> 01:09:02,900
overcome dot catastrophe of life.

1553
01:09:03,620 --> 01:09:04,281
And you might say,

1554
01:09:04,281 --> 01:09:06,530
well why we're coming to
catastrophe your life?

1555
01:09:06,920 --> 01:09:08,360
Well there's a bunch of answers to that.

1556
01:09:08,390 --> 01:09:13,390
One is well you'll be in your own little
hell if you don't and so unless that's

1557
01:09:13,581 --> 01:09:16,430
what you want and then
I wouldn't recommend it,

1558
01:09:16,670 --> 01:09:20,690
but that's only the beginning of things
and this is something 12 was like cause

1559
01:09:20,691 --> 01:09:21,560
in some way a very,

1560
01:09:21,561 --> 01:09:22,740
very dark book.

1561
01:09:23,030 --> 01:09:25,730
Like I make a very
chapter six for example,

1562
01:09:25,731 --> 01:09:27,770
which is put your house in
perfect order before you,

1563
01:09:27,870 --> 01:09:28,703
the size of the world.

1564
01:09:28,910 --> 01:09:31,940
There's a full explanation of what
happened yesterday in Florida.

1565
01:09:33,130 --> 01:09:33,380
No,

1566
01:09:33,380 --> 01:09:37,490
because I spend a lot of time to try to
figure out just exactly how is it that

1567
01:09:37,491 --> 01:09:42,491
you have to think for several months or
years in your Bruning obsession about

1568
01:09:43,251 --> 01:09:46,880
the structure of the world before you
decided that it's really a good idea to

1569
01:09:46,881 --> 01:09:48,260
pick up a 70 on a rifle,

1570
01:09:48,290 --> 01:09:51,710
semi automatic rifle and going into high
school and shoot a bunch of innocent

1571
01:09:51,711 --> 01:09:53,120
people or maybe worse.

1572
01:09:53,120 --> 01:09:55,790
You'd go in Connecticut
and it in high school.

1573
01:09:55,791 --> 01:10:00,000
Kids who shoot it's elementary school
kids just to put that extra Marin.

1574
01:10:00,001 --> 01:10:03,680
She Cherry on top of your
delightful confection of evil,

1575
01:10:03,950 --> 01:10:04,221
right?

1576
01:10:04,221 --> 01:10:05,630
Because high school kids,

1577
01:10:05,631 --> 01:10:07,760
but they'd probably done
at least something wrong.

1578
01:10:08,030 --> 01:10:09,320
It was elementary school kids,

1579
01:10:09,321 --> 01:10:12,050
they're getting as close the innocence
as you could cost cause damage.

1580
01:10:12,350 --> 01:10:17,350
And so if you're particularly negatively
inclined and you have your reasons,

1581
01:10:18,311 --> 01:10:21,110
then the most innocent target
is the most attractive.

1582
01:10:21,590 --> 01:10:23,240
And so if you want to understand that,

1583
01:10:23,390 --> 01:10:24,440
and you probably should,

1584
01:10:24,500 --> 01:10:25,820
even though you really don't want it,

1585
01:10:26,160 --> 01:10:30,060
then you can read chapter six because
I've tried very hard to put myself in hand

1586
01:10:30,061 --> 01:10:31,490
and people who do that sort of thing,

1587
01:10:31,940 --> 01:10:33,330
and I understand why they do it.

1588
01:10:33,370 --> 01:10:38,060
And part of it is a live lives that
are nothing but pain and anxiety.

1589
01:10:38,840 --> 01:10:40,340
And there's all sorts of reasons for that.

1590
01:10:40,340 --> 01:10:41,690
Sometimes it's bad luck,

1591
01:10:41,691 --> 01:10:44,030
sometimes it's neural chemical accidents,

1592
01:10:44,031 --> 01:10:48,880
sometimes until health is
often tied up with a fair edit,

1593
01:10:49,580 --> 01:10:51,920
let's call it moral psychopathology.

1594
01:10:52,190 --> 01:10:55,700
They don't see any positive meaning in
life that outweighs the catastrophe of

1595
01:10:55,701 --> 01:10:59,420
life and then become normally
immersed in their own little hell,

1596
01:10:59,600 --> 01:11:00,560
which is bad enough.

1597
01:11:00,890 --> 01:11:05,840
But eventually stewing in that hell leads
them to the inevitable conclusion that

1598
01:11:05,841 --> 01:11:10,700
distributing it as widely as possible
with as much may have as possible with as

1599
01:11:10,701 --> 01:11:15,180
much evil intent as can be managed in
the shortest possible period of time is

1600
01:11:15,240 --> 01:11:20,160
definitely the right thing to do and so
the thing is is that your food doesn't

1601
01:11:20,161 --> 01:11:22,190
collapse in the hierarchy of values.

1602
01:11:23,490 --> 01:11:25,370
Extract out what might be deposited,

1603
01:11:25,440 --> 01:11:26,490
meaning from your life,

1604
01:11:26,491 --> 01:11:27,390
which is bad enough.

1605
01:11:27,630 --> 01:11:29,010
It's sex you on the road,

1606
01:11:29,750 --> 01:11:31,820
it sets you on the road to hell.

1607
01:11:31,980 --> 01:11:32,850
That's the right way.

1608
01:11:32,880 --> 01:11:34,190
There isn't a prop.

1609
01:11:34,200 --> 01:11:39,200
There isn't a more accurate way of using
metaphorical language to describe that

1610
01:11:40,261 --> 01:11:45,261
pathway then that and that's why it's
part of what would you say the realization

1611
01:11:47,341 --> 01:11:51,450
that at the bottom of belief systems
at the bottom of the way that people

1612
01:11:51,451 --> 01:11:52,410
construe the world,

1613
01:11:52,620 --> 01:11:55,340
there are religious metaphors at some,

1614
01:11:55,410 --> 01:11:57,450
sometimes you need a level of analysis,

1615
01:11:57,451 --> 01:12:02,010
but it's so deep that there isn't anything
that suffices for the analysis except

1616
01:12:02,011 --> 01:12:03,600
that level of metaphorical language.

1617
01:12:03,870 --> 01:12:05,970
I certainly the case when
you're dealing with people like,

1618
01:12:06,450 --> 01:12:07,470
like mass shooters,

1619
01:12:07,920 --> 01:12:09,390
especially the ones that commit suicide

1620
01:12:11,870 --> 01:12:12,461
because that's what,

1621
01:12:12,461 --> 01:12:13,410
these are the floors too,

1622
01:12:13,411 --> 01:12:13,980
right?

1623
01:12:13,980 --> 01:12:14,813
Cause my take,

1624
01:12:15,180 --> 01:12:17,880
why not just shoot yourself at home and
save the rest of us all the God damn

1625
01:12:17,881 --> 01:12:18,714
trouble.

1626
01:12:18,990 --> 01:12:19,290
Right?

1627
01:12:19,290 --> 01:12:20,071
No seriously.

1628
01:12:20,071 --> 01:12:21,240
That's an important question.

1629
01:12:21,570 --> 01:12:22,650
That's a crucial question.

1630
01:12:23,070 --> 01:12:23,671
So like if you're,

1631
01:12:23,671 --> 01:12:24,121
if you're,

1632
01:12:24,121 --> 01:12:25,320
if you're done with your life,

1633
01:12:26,460 --> 01:12:28,110
why bother with the big display?

1634
01:12:28,860 --> 01:12:30,750
Who exactly are you trying to convince?

1635
01:12:31,120 --> 01:12:32,610
And a what now?

1636
01:12:32,611 --> 01:12:36,150
Some of it is that desire for post-talk
notoriety because there's a lot of

1637
01:12:36,180 --> 01:12:37,200
fantasizing can try.

1638
01:12:37,201 --> 01:12:37,560
It's that.

1639
01:12:37,560 --> 01:12:38,130
It's like,

1640
01:12:38,130 --> 01:12:42,930
well don't be sorry when this
common theme in suicidal fantasies,

1641
01:12:42,931 --> 01:12:46,770
especially if on adolescents there'll
be sorry they did acts to be witnessed,

1642
01:12:46,771 --> 01:12:47,940
happens when they see my,

1643
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:48,300
you know,

1644
01:12:48,300 --> 01:12:49,690
cold body in the coffin or,

1645
01:12:50,160 --> 01:12:52,620
or when they see the
mayhem that I produced.

1646
01:12:52,680 --> 01:12:53,351
But more it's,

1647
01:12:53,351 --> 01:12:53,651
it's,

1648
01:12:53,651 --> 01:12:54,120
it's a,

1649
01:12:54,120 --> 01:12:58,080
it's a quick group to notoriety status
as we've already discovered this very

1650
01:12:58,081 --> 01:12:58,911
important to people.

1651
01:12:58,911 --> 01:13:01,350
And if you can't get
into in a positive way,

1652
01:13:02,010 --> 01:13:05,700
then well you know what was
given to me a negative way.

1653
01:13:06,810 --> 01:13:07,760
And so you know,

1654
01:13:07,770 --> 01:13:11,010
when we do ourselves a great disservice
by publishing the names of the shooters

1655
01:13:11,670 --> 01:13:16,080
and maybe at some point we become
mature enough not to do that.

1656
01:13:16,080 --> 01:13:18,450
But it doesn't look like that time is now.

1657
01:13:18,480 --> 01:13:20,400
And sort of these people
are also very competitive.

1658
01:13:20,990 --> 01:13:21,361
You know,

1659
01:13:21,361 --> 01:13:23,790
it's not like one shooter doesn't
know what the previous one was.

1660
01:13:23,791 --> 01:13:24,624
Knockin

1661
01:13:27,180 --> 01:13:32,180
so in rural one I also talk about how
to deal with this on equal landscapes.

1662
01:13:34,260 --> 01:13:34,930
You know,

1663
01:13:34,930 --> 01:13:39,840
and I make a case about maybe you'd
be bullied when you were a kid,

1664
01:13:40,230 --> 01:13:41,360
but some high you're liking,

1665
01:13:41,370 --> 01:13:42,660
cause everyone's pulling me as a kid,

1666
01:13:42,661 --> 01:13:45,300
but maybe boy more than normal.

1667
01:13:45,330 --> 01:13:46,163
You know,

1668
01:13:46,220 --> 01:13:51,220
you are a continual part of the employee
that's kind of traumatized students.

1669
01:13:51,540 --> 01:13:55,740
So you're not as upward
with it as you might think.

1670
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:56,521
It's like,

1671
01:13:56,521 --> 01:13:57,990
well what do you do about that?

1672
01:13:58,780 --> 01:14:03,240
Well hopefully you can remove yourself
from the circumstances that obtained when

1673
01:14:03,241 --> 01:14:04,074
you were being bullied.

1674
01:14:04,200 --> 01:14:07,080
That happens often to people as they
mature because you're much more likely to

1675
01:14:07,081 --> 01:14:08,940
be bullied as a kid that
you are as an adult,

1676
01:14:09,390 --> 01:14:09,630
you know?

1677
01:14:09,630 --> 01:14:11,190
So sometimes it just maturation.

1678
01:14:11,200 --> 01:14:11,650
We'll get that.

1679
01:14:11,650 --> 01:14:15,520
But you still might
carry the scars of your,

1680
01:14:15,670 --> 01:14:16,503
of your

1681
01:14:18,070 --> 01:14:23,070
experiences with being unfair and Goldman
or why you stretch yourself back up.

1682
01:14:23,660 --> 01:14:27,520
You do that physically and physically
and then a physical element is something

1683
01:14:27,521 --> 01:14:28,354
like,

1684
01:14:31,660 --> 01:14:36,660
well first it's a recognition that see
the kids who do these terrible things,

1685
01:14:38,160 --> 01:14:43,160
a very annoyed yet the way the world is
structured because the world contains a

1686
01:14:43,331 --> 01:14:48,331
tremendous amount of suffering and they
often regard themselves as hopefully you

1687
01:14:49,121 --> 01:14:54,121
call rebellious advocates of protest
against the suffering of the world.

1688
01:14:54,390 --> 01:14:56,370
If you read the by your kids notes,

1689
01:14:56,390 --> 01:14:58,810
you'll see that jump the judges of being,

1690
01:14:58,811 --> 01:15:01,470
I think that because being is
contaminated with suffering,

1691
01:15:01,640 --> 01:15:03,500
if 11 months that it should be eradicated,

1692
01:15:03,550 --> 01:15:04,750
that's the central theory.

1693
01:15:05,310 --> 01:15:06,143
Um,

1694
01:15:06,310 --> 01:15:07,143
they,

1695
01:15:08,850 --> 01:15:12,040
we allow their own
suffering to embetter them.

1696
01:15:12,670 --> 01:15:14,290
I guess that's the right
way thinking about it.

1697
01:15:14,290 --> 01:15:15,310
And it's understandable,

1698
01:15:15,340 --> 01:15:15,610
right?

1699
01:15:15,610 --> 01:15:20,080
That's the thing is that because life is
hard and some people really have heart

1700
01:15:20,081 --> 01:15:20,381
bucks,

1701
01:15:20,381 --> 01:15:20,651
you know,

1702
01:15:20,651 --> 01:15:22,900
like almost everyone
has a pretty hard life.

1703
01:15:23,170 --> 01:15:24,003
You get right down.

1704
01:15:24,100 --> 01:15:24,933
I'm ready to talk.

1705
01:15:26,140 --> 01:15:27,120
People have hard lives.

1706
01:15:27,140 --> 01:15:29,200
You know you have $100 million,

1707
01:15:29,201 --> 01:15:30,090
but your father's dying.

1708
01:15:30,810 --> 01:15:33,190
It's like it's great that you're rich,

1709
01:15:33,191 --> 01:15:35,520
but you know your father's going to hell.

1710
01:15:35,521 --> 01:15:36,040
It's fine.

1711
01:15:36,040 --> 01:15:40,930
There's nothing to do with almost
everyone has gotten an ongoing tragedy in

1712
01:15:40,931 --> 01:15:45,160
their own personal life as an individual
or is typing associated with someone

1713
01:15:45,161 --> 01:15:48,880
who does and there's not much we can
do in some ways to protect ourselves

1714
01:15:48,881 --> 01:15:50,590
against that material.

1715
01:15:50,591 --> 01:15:51,201
Wealth alone,

1716
01:15:51,201 --> 01:15:53,440
just like it's better than poverty,

1717
01:15:53,470 --> 01:15:55,180
but there's many things.

1718
01:15:55,181 --> 01:15:58,210
It just doesn't address many
of the most fundamental things.

1719
01:15:58,360 --> 01:16:00,100
There's every reason to become admitted,

1720
01:16:00,880 --> 01:16:02,970
but the problem is is if
you becoming better to them,

1721
01:16:03,310 --> 01:16:07,780
everything that makes you bitter gets
worth that seems to be able to bad

1722
01:16:07,781 --> 01:16:08,590
solution.

1723
01:16:08,590 --> 01:16:09,630
I spent a lot of times,

1724
01:16:09,631 --> 01:16:13,360
some of you might have listened to my
biblical lectures on cane enabled because

1725
01:16:13,361 --> 01:16:14,650
that's the story of Cain and Abel.

1726
01:16:14,860 --> 01:16:19,130
Cain gets bitter and he's angry at God
because of the structure of the universe.

1727
01:16:19,570 --> 01:16:20,200
No mongers,

1728
01:16:20,200 --> 01:16:21,033
you know,

1729
01:16:21,230 --> 01:16:24,870
less time up as having none
of us basically tells Kane.

1730
01:16:24,871 --> 01:16:29,871
Then if he used everything that was in
front of him to its proper advantage,

1731
01:16:31,090 --> 01:16:33,880
then the world that he wouldn't have,

1732
01:16:33,881 --> 01:16:37,480
it would no longer be characterized
by an unbearable suffering.

1733
01:16:38,460 --> 01:16:39,100
You know,

1734
01:16:39,100 --> 01:16:42,850
one of the things that I've learned
from reading the biblical stories among

1735
01:16:42,851 --> 01:16:43,710
other things and,

1736
01:16:43,750 --> 01:16:44,920
and the clinical literature,

1737
01:16:44,921 --> 01:16:45,754
I would say,

1738
01:16:45,820 --> 01:16:48,010
is that there's really
something to that idea.

1739
01:16:48,730 --> 01:16:49,080
You know,

1740
01:16:49,080 --> 01:16:51,550
and I said the 12 rules for
life is a very dark book.

1741
01:16:52,010 --> 01:16:52,270
You know,

1742
01:16:52,270 --> 01:16:55,510
because plays up in no uncertain terms.

1743
01:16:55,511 --> 01:16:56,181
The idea of a,

1744
01:16:56,181 --> 01:16:57,800
that life is characterized by suffering,

1745
01:16:57,830 --> 01:16:58,870
that's a universal truth,

1746
01:16:58,990 --> 01:16:59,530
suffering,

1747
01:16:59,530 --> 01:17:00,550
pain and anxiety.

1748
01:17:00,820 --> 01:17:04,500
To put it more in a more
differentiated manner.

1749
01:17:04,930 --> 01:17:05,890
And at that painting,

1750
01:17:05,900 --> 01:17:07,620
suffering is enough to embitter you.

1751
01:17:08,170 --> 01:17:09,860
And understandably so.

1752
01:17:10,340 --> 01:17:12,710
So that's the dark status quo,

1753
01:17:12,711 --> 01:17:13,520
let's say.

1754
01:17:13,520 --> 01:17:14,990
But then the next question would be,

1755
01:17:14,991 --> 01:17:17,090
what do you have any arm
movements against that?

1756
01:17:17,120 --> 01:17:17,390
Right?

1757
01:17:17,390 --> 01:17:21,890
What do you use in your struggle
against tragedy and evil?

1758
01:17:22,560 --> 01:17:23,393
And

1759
01:17:24,590 --> 01:17:28,040
while that's courage
and truth and courage,

1760
01:17:28,050 --> 01:17:29,250
that's partly posture.

1761
01:17:30,130 --> 01:17:30,440
You know,

1762
01:17:30,440 --> 01:17:34,760
cause when you stand up and
expose yourself and you've
exposed the parts of you

1763
01:17:34,761 --> 01:17:36,800
that you're most vulnerable
to confidence stamps,

1764
01:17:37,070 --> 01:17:39,140
it's like how bad or you know,

1765
01:17:39,980 --> 01:17:40,813
come acne.

1766
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:42,500
And that's the attitude to the world.

1767
01:17:42,501 --> 01:17:43,041
It's combat,

1768
01:17:43,041 --> 01:17:43,461
it's downs,

1769
01:17:43,461 --> 01:17:44,241
but not just that.

1770
01:17:44,241 --> 01:17:46,400
It's also a trusting stance in some sense,

1771
01:17:46,420 --> 01:17:46,890
right?

1772
01:17:46,890 --> 01:17:49,900
Cause the Hydra people means
that you don't trust them on,

1773
01:17:50,020 --> 01:17:50,853
I've learned something,

1774
01:17:51,140 --> 01:17:55,970
something too about the difference
between nine eva take now you've trust and

1775
01:17:55,971 --> 01:17:56,804
trust.

1776
01:17:57,080 --> 01:18:01,710
So like a child who's naive
thinks everyone is good and
then maybe we'll become,

1777
01:18:01,730 --> 01:18:02,650
be traded her guest.

1778
01:18:02,651 --> 01:18:05,720
The consequences of naive and
everyone was good and so trust,

1779
01:18:05,840 --> 01:18:06,860
but that's not trust.

1780
01:18:06,861 --> 01:18:07,780
That's just naive.

1781
01:18:08,270 --> 01:18:09,200
And it's not a virtue.

1782
01:18:09,740 --> 01:18:11,750
Even though it trusting
child was a lovely thing.

1783
01:18:11,930 --> 01:18:12,763
It's not a virtue.

1784
01:18:13,160 --> 01:18:17,000
It's just the absence of
experience with betrayal.

1785
01:18:17,170 --> 01:18:17,781
So we'll like,

1786
01:18:17,781 --> 01:18:19,370
once you're an adult teenager,

1787
01:18:19,371 --> 01:18:20,660
like say you've been hurt,

1788
01:18:20,661 --> 01:18:21,560
you've been betrayed,

1789
01:18:21,740 --> 01:18:25,520
why should you trust and answer is
never because people are trustworthy.

1790
01:18:25,970 --> 01:18:26,930
That's the wrong answer.

1791
01:18:27,350 --> 01:18:29,480
The right answer is because
you're a courageous.

1792
01:18:30,170 --> 01:18:31,160
That's the right answer.

1793
01:18:31,700 --> 01:18:33,950
And so you meet people
with an attitude of trust,

1794
01:18:34,280 --> 01:18:37,310
knowing what can go wrong,

1795
01:18:37,880 --> 01:18:42,880
but the willing to take
that as a necessary cost of
potentially bringing out the

1796
01:18:42,891 --> 01:18:44,810
best in the other person and in you.

1797
01:18:45,200 --> 01:18:46,700
And I would say,

1798
01:18:47,210 --> 01:18:50,690
I would also say that the empirical data
on the utility of that as an approach

1799
01:18:50,691 --> 01:18:52,190
is also quite staggering with the high,

1800
01:18:52,490 --> 01:18:56,990
some of the best analysis of what
makes countries rich versus poor,

1801
01:18:57,230 --> 01:19:01,700
but indicated that the
level of interpersonal trust
and the country is a great

1802
01:19:01,701 --> 01:19:05,870
predictor of economic don't
believe economic success
but probability of economic

1803
01:19:05,871 --> 01:19:06,704
growth.

1804
01:19:06,890 --> 01:19:09,470
And you can understand why that is is
like how the hell are you going to train

1805
01:19:09,471 --> 01:19:14,471
with someone without accruing enforced
and costs that will completely obliterate

1806
01:19:15,081 --> 01:19:17,510
the utility of the train
unless you trust them.

1807
01:19:17,511 --> 01:19:18,650
Like if I can trust you,

1808
01:19:18,740 --> 01:19:20,000
I don't have to know anything about you.

1809
01:19:20,140 --> 01:19:22,880
I don't have to know how
full snakes you actually are.

1810
01:19:22,970 --> 01:19:27,020
It doesn't matter cause you simplify
yourself down with your word and then we

1811
01:19:27,021 --> 01:19:29,000
can interact cooperative.

1812
01:19:29,060 --> 01:19:33,350
And so I really think that
the only natural resource,

1813
01:19:33,860 --> 01:19:34,910
apart from intelligence,

1814
01:19:34,911 --> 01:19:39,250
perhaps his trucks and the
trust is actually a consequence
of courage and not of

1815
01:19:39,260 --> 01:19:40,610
naivety when it's matured.

1816
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:43,850
And I help my clients
with that idea a lot.

1817
01:19:43,970 --> 01:19:45,130
I mean it's not exactly,

1818
01:19:46,160 --> 01:19:50,280
I read the works of most of the
brake conditions of the 20th century.

1819
01:19:50,540 --> 01:19:52,040
So I've learned a tremendous amount from,

1820
01:19:52,430 --> 01:19:52,671
you know,

1821
01:19:52,671 --> 01:19:53,870
from reading what they have to say.

1822
01:19:54,200 --> 01:19:56,600
And that idea of courageous
trust is a really,

1823
01:19:56,690 --> 01:19:58,100
that's an unbelievably powerful,

1824
01:19:58,940 --> 01:19:59,850
especially when you're doing,

1825
01:19:59,920 --> 01:20:00,750
he might think behind,

1826
01:20:00,750 --> 01:20:01,220
not neat,

1827
01:20:01,220 --> 01:20:01,551
naive,

1828
01:20:01,551 --> 01:20:02,660
I'm not going to trust people.

1829
01:20:03,080 --> 01:20:03,351
It's like,

1830
01:20:03,351 --> 01:20:03,681
yeah,

1831
01:20:03,681 --> 01:20:04,221
fair enough.

1832
01:20:04,221 --> 01:20:05,330
That makes you not naive.

1833
01:20:05,390 --> 01:20:06,223
That's step one.

1834
01:20:06,420 --> 01:20:07,500
Now you step one,

1835
01:20:07,620 --> 01:20:08,610
not naive,

1836
01:20:09,030 --> 01:20:10,660
that step to not,

1837
01:20:10,930 --> 01:20:12,450
not even willing to trust,

1838
01:20:12,960 --> 01:20:13,830
that's day three.

1839
01:20:14,330 --> 01:20:15,060
Right?

1840
01:20:15,060 --> 01:20:15,990
And that opens the world.

1841
01:20:15,991 --> 01:20:17,250
That's to Q again say,

1842
01:20:17,260 --> 01:20:20,940
will you voluntarily take on the fact
that you're vulnerable and that life is

1843
01:20:20,941 --> 01:20:22,890
tragic and that it's
tainted by malevolence.

1844
01:20:23,160 --> 01:20:27,900
You accept that and then you decided to
move forward and do good despite that.

1845
01:20:28,640 --> 01:20:30,330
And well I don't.

1846
01:20:30,530 --> 01:20:30,821
And,

1847
01:20:30,821 --> 01:20:33,480
and so part of the conclusion
in 12 rules for life,

1848
01:20:33,481 --> 01:20:36,120
although not stated no
as a formal conclusion,

1849
01:20:36,121 --> 01:20:41,121
is that terrible as tragedy is and tainted
by malevolence as life is truth and

1850
01:20:44,631 --> 01:20:47,370
courage are stronger
than pain and despair.

1851
01:20:47,740 --> 01:20:48,990
And I actually think that's true.

1852
01:20:49,530 --> 01:20:50,131
I think it's true.

1853
01:20:50,131 --> 01:20:51,750
Literally you see,

1854
01:20:51,751 --> 01:20:53,450
you see this in psychotherapy.

1855
01:20:54,030 --> 01:20:58,500
So if someone comes to you and they
have like paralyzing levels of anxiety,

1856
01:20:58,720 --> 01:20:59,570
you cannot give you the house.

1857
01:20:59,620 --> 01:21:00,453
They're agoraphobic.

1858
01:21:00,930 --> 01:21:04,050
So they're terrified of being in
an elevator and getting stuck.

1859
01:21:04,051 --> 01:21:04,590
They're afraid.

1860
01:21:04,590 --> 01:21:06,640
What the really afraid
of and an elevator is,

1861
01:21:06,641 --> 01:21:07,650
they'll often,

1862
01:21:07,651 --> 01:21:11,790
people who have anger phobia are
afraid that they'll have a heart attack

1863
01:21:11,791 --> 01:21:12,181
somewhere.

1864
01:21:12,181 --> 01:21:13,350
They can't get to the hospital.

1865
01:21:13,880 --> 01:21:16,080
So then they get afraid of
anywhere that they might go away,

1866
01:21:16,090 --> 01:21:17,490
they couldn't get to the hospital quickly.

1867
01:21:17,910 --> 01:21:19,800
And so that will be taxis,

1868
01:21:19,860 --> 01:21:21,510
especially in a busy street.

1869
01:21:21,920 --> 01:21:22,770
Subways,

1870
01:21:22,860 --> 01:21:27,510
theaters telemeers getting in places
where they might get trapped and their

1871
01:21:27,511 --> 01:21:31,830
thoughts are if often
having heart palpitations or
someone close to them died of

1872
01:21:31,831 --> 01:21:35,670
a heart attack or they have to have
any history of heart disease or they've

1873
01:21:35,671 --> 01:21:38,640
recently been through a divorce and being
very anxious because of that and are

1874
01:21:38,641 --> 01:21:40,920
more cognizant that the hotel anyway,

1875
01:21:40,980 --> 01:21:44,850
they have got reasons to start becoming
anxious and then being avoid places that

1876
01:21:44,851 --> 01:21:47,460
they might get trapped in that they
get more and more anxious and fighting.

1877
01:21:47,460 --> 01:21:48,630
They can't even leave their house.

1878
01:21:48,990 --> 01:21:52,020
And so when you treat someone like that,

1879
01:21:52,190 --> 01:21:56,160
you don't make them less afraid
because it's too damn late for that,

1880
01:21:56,730 --> 01:21:57,563
you know,

1881
01:21:58,260 --> 01:21:59,460
they're naive to begin with.

1882
01:21:59,461 --> 01:22:00,540
This is often the case with,

1883
01:22:00,600 --> 01:22:02,280
it's usually women who felt anger phobia.

1884
01:22:02,940 --> 01:22:07,050
They've often be over protected by the
fondant or the boyfriend or the husband

1885
01:22:07,051 --> 01:22:08,310
or whatever have you,

1886
01:22:08,311 --> 01:22:12,450
and then something comes along that they
can't be protected from like some hint

1887
01:22:12,451 --> 01:22:17,400
of mortality or the possibility of
divorce and they become extraordinarily

1888
01:22:17,401 --> 01:22:18,920
anxious to come see a therapist.

1889
01:22:19,260 --> 01:22:20,370
Therapist has any sense.

1890
01:22:20,400 --> 01:22:21,233
It doesn't say,

1891
01:22:21,330 --> 01:22:21,671
why don't we,

1892
01:22:21,671 --> 01:22:22,740
what you're anxious about?

1893
01:22:23,150 --> 01:22:23,491
It says,

1894
01:22:23,491 --> 01:22:23,701
well,

1895
01:22:23,701 --> 01:22:24,710
of course you're anxious,

1896
01:22:24,780 --> 01:22:27,710
so I could s what are you staggering
that everyone is terrified?

1897
01:22:28,060 --> 01:22:29,850
One scholar was open the time,

1898
01:22:30,500 --> 01:22:32,270
like why are people anxious?

1899
01:22:32,610 --> 01:22:37,000
What a stupid question that
like really wanting phalanges.

1900
01:22:37,320 --> 01:22:38,110
Yeah.

1901
01:22:38,110 --> 01:22:39,420
One of the people drink.

1902
01:22:39,570 --> 01:22:40,920
I don't think I can answer for that.

1903
01:22:41,100 --> 01:22:41,890
Why don't people take,

1904
01:22:41,890 --> 01:22:42,630
okay,

1905
01:22:42,630 --> 01:22:43,650
no wrong question,

1906
01:22:43,900 --> 01:22:44,131
right.

1907
01:22:44,131 --> 01:22:47,770
Question is why don't they take it all
the time to the exclusion of all else?

1908
01:22:50,970 --> 01:22:52,350
It's like we know why people take,

1909
01:22:52,370 --> 01:22:52,770
okay.

1910
01:22:52,770 --> 01:22:53,840
It's perfectly all of this.

1911
01:22:53,841 --> 01:22:56,190
And so the question with anxieties,

1912
01:22:56,430 --> 01:23:00,510
how is it that some people aren't
anxious some of the time and with the

1913
01:23:00,511 --> 01:23:01,220
agoraphobic,

1914
01:23:01,220 --> 01:23:01,771
the issue is,

1915
01:23:01,771 --> 01:23:01,861
well,

1916
01:23:01,861 --> 01:23:06,220
how do you bring in state that now that
they've come to confrontation with their

1917
01:23:06,221 --> 01:23:07,780
own vulnerability is mortality.

1918
01:23:07,810 --> 01:23:08,860
That's basically the issue.

1919
01:23:09,040 --> 01:23:10,180
There's no holding back.

1920
01:23:10,840 --> 01:23:11,380
You know,

1921
01:23:11,380 --> 01:23:12,400
maybe the person who says,

1922
01:23:12,401 --> 01:23:12,521
well,

1923
01:23:12,521 --> 01:23:13,690
I've got her qualifications.

1924
01:23:13,740 --> 01:23:15,250
I have a family history of heart disease.

1925
01:23:15,880 --> 01:23:17,100
It's like I'm sure a terrified.

1926
01:23:17,280 --> 01:23:17,680
It's like,

1927
01:23:17,680 --> 01:23:18,460
how does nothing,

1928
01:23:18,460 --> 01:23:20,050
you probably won't have a heart attack.

1929
01:23:20,980 --> 01:23:21,813
Oh,

1930
01:23:22,240 --> 01:23:22,601
hey,

1931
01:23:22,601 --> 01:23:23,230
thanks.

1932
01:23:23,230 --> 01:23:25,010
[inaudible].

1933
01:23:27,130 --> 01:23:28,810
Once that specter of here,

1934
01:23:28,811 --> 01:23:29,920
this in front of you,

1935
01:23:30,670 --> 01:23:32,920
probability is irrelevant.

1936
01:23:34,060 --> 01:23:36,720
Most of what did you do is you teach
people to live in spite of them.

1937
01:23:37,630 --> 01:23:39,340
You teach them to be courageous,

1938
01:23:39,341 --> 01:23:40,174
not to be,

1939
01:23:40,660 --> 01:23:41,493
not afraid.

1940
01:23:42,010 --> 01:23:43,180
You teach them to be brave.

1941
01:23:43,181 --> 01:23:46,390
And the way you do that is you show
them that there's more to them than they

1942
01:23:46,391 --> 01:23:47,224
thought.

1943
01:23:47,560 --> 01:23:49,690
So you know when you do this
with behavioral exposure,

1944
01:23:49,691 --> 01:23:50,201
for example,

1945
01:23:50,201 --> 01:23:54,250
so let's say you want to
take an agoraphobic doesn't
mean an elevator for three

1946
01:23:54,251 --> 01:23:55,084
years.

1947
01:23:55,090 --> 01:23:56,140
And so you know,

1948
01:23:56,170 --> 01:23:57,910
maybe they work on the 15th floor.

1949
01:23:57,911 --> 01:23:58,631
This is actually an,

1950
01:23:58,631 --> 01:23:59,321
they're getting older.

1951
01:23:59,321 --> 01:24:00,430
It's actually a problem,

1952
01:24:00,431 --> 01:24:00,630
right?

1953
01:24:00,630 --> 01:24:05,050
You got to take the down elevator
and there's a whole complex of fears

1954
01:24:05,051 --> 01:24:06,310
associated with the elevator.

1955
01:24:06,400 --> 01:24:07,630
So you say,

1956
01:24:07,631 --> 01:24:08,464
well,

1957
01:24:08,790 --> 01:24:09,040
you know,

1958
01:24:09,040 --> 01:24:09,770
what are you afraid of?

1959
01:24:09,770 --> 01:24:10,180
And they say,

1960
01:24:10,180 --> 01:24:10,551
well,

1961
01:24:10,551 --> 01:24:11,384
I'll have a heart attack.

1962
01:24:11,430 --> 01:24:13,110
That elevator stop all get stuck,

1963
01:24:13,120 --> 01:24:17,110
all panic on a heart attack and die and
there'll be 300 people in the elevator

1964
01:24:17,350 --> 01:24:19,210
and they'll make a fool
of myself while I'm dying.

1965
01:24:19,211 --> 01:24:21,020
And no point in being black

1966
01:24:24,230 --> 01:24:26,680
because it's social humiliation.

1967
01:24:26,820 --> 01:24:28,330
If people hate plus death.

1968
01:24:28,720 --> 01:24:30,010
And so you get those two together,

1969
01:24:30,011 --> 01:24:32,800
you ever read walloping
fear of complex going,

1970
01:24:32,801 --> 01:24:35,650
I'm going to die slowly and stupidly.

1971
01:24:35,800 --> 01:24:36,041
Well,

1972
01:24:36,041 --> 01:24:38,160
lots of people are gathered
around watching it.

1973
01:24:40,500 --> 01:24:41,333
So,

1974
01:24:41,540 --> 01:24:42,370
so I,

1975
01:24:42,370 --> 01:24:44,170
I had for agoraphobic client.

1976
01:24:45,400 --> 01:24:47,500
So the way you treat someone
like that and you say,

1977
01:24:47,501 --> 01:24:47,681
okay,

1978
01:24:47,681 --> 01:24:48,011
well let's,

1979
01:24:48,011 --> 01:24:48,844
let's pick some,

1980
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:52,550
write down the 10 things you're really
afraid of with number one being the thing

1981
01:24:52,551 --> 01:24:53,291
you're most afraid of,

1982
01:24:53,291 --> 01:24:54,160
a number 10 minutes,

1983
01:24:54,161 --> 01:24:55,300
something you're pretty afraid of.

1984
01:24:55,301 --> 01:24:57,330
And so let's say they list elevators.

1985
01:24:57,340 --> 01:24:58,650
His numbers would say,

1986
01:24:58,700 --> 01:24:58,901
okay,

1987
01:24:58,901 --> 01:25:02,890
we're going to start with number 10
because we're not going to make this any

1988
01:25:02,891 --> 01:25:03,790
more difficult for you.

1989
01:25:03,791 --> 01:25:04,950
Then that's,

1990
01:25:05,530 --> 01:25:05,951
then you say,

1991
01:25:05,951 --> 01:25:06,191
look,

1992
01:25:06,191 --> 01:25:06,610
there's,

1993
01:25:06,610 --> 01:25:08,080
there's no tricks to this.

1994
01:25:08,350 --> 01:25:09,760
You've done it in the
first guys to trust you.

1995
01:25:10,030 --> 01:25:14,180
I treated some of them with a needle
phobia while bathroom and this person has

1996
01:25:14,470 --> 01:25:17,680
needle phobia that was so intense that
he would have dental surgery without

1997
01:25:17,770 --> 01:25:18,603
anesthesia.

1998
01:25:18,820 --> 01:25:19,653
So,

1999
01:25:19,720 --> 01:25:20,111
right,

2000
01:25:20,111 --> 01:25:20,471
right.

2001
01:25:20,471 --> 01:25:24,940
So we know that's the
definition of whether not,

2002
01:25:27,620 --> 01:25:28,240
you know,

2003
01:25:28,240 --> 01:25:33,200
I brought a needle into the office and
I told him a week before I'm going to

2004
01:25:33,200 --> 01:25:36,220
bring an evening into the office and it's
going to be sitting on the shelf right

2005
01:25:36,221 --> 01:25:40,340
there and when you come in next week
I'll show it to you and you'll know where

2006
01:25:40,341 --> 01:25:42,730
it gets cause you don't muck
about with your clients.

2007
01:25:42,730 --> 01:25:44,290
They have to know exactly what's going on.

2008
01:25:44,590 --> 01:25:46,840
And then when I did the cameras practice,

2009
01:25:47,110 --> 01:25:48,550
I let him practice leaving.

2010
01:25:49,390 --> 01:25:50,620
I said because I want you to,

2011
01:25:50,621 --> 01:25:51,790
if you're a neutral with this,

2012
01:25:51,820 --> 01:25:53,470
that was the rule and
you're in control this,

2013
01:25:53,860 --> 01:25:57,040
I'm going to pick up that Amigo but not
until I tell you and if you want me to

2014
01:25:57,041 --> 01:26:00,970
stop at any time I will stop and if you
want to leave at anytime you can just

2015
01:26:00,971 --> 01:26:01,241
leave it.

2016
01:26:01,241 --> 01:26:02,530
I'm going to get your
fear if you leave it.

2017
01:26:02,990 --> 01:26:06,200
And so I haven't practiced
like 10 times how,

2018
01:26:06,201 --> 01:26:09,200
let me just stop and leave
it because just telling me,

2019
01:26:09,230 --> 01:26:10,520
telling him that it wasn't enough.

2020
01:26:10,860 --> 01:26:14,990
It's kind of like practicing something
with pretending to play with the child,

2021
01:26:15,020 --> 01:26:15,853
right?

2022
01:26:15,860 --> 01:26:16,940
To act it out with them.

2023
01:26:16,941 --> 01:26:18,200
It's better than just to tell them,

2024
01:26:18,380 --> 01:26:20,180
because you get to know if
you have children by the way.

2025
01:26:20,390 --> 01:26:22,110
So I let them practice that,

2026
01:26:22,111 --> 01:26:23,010
like tender,

2027
01:26:23,060 --> 01:26:24,200
tell him he was bored with it,

2028
01:26:24,330 --> 01:26:26,280
no new drill was right.

2029
01:26:26,780 --> 01:26:27,613
And then,

2030
01:26:27,650 --> 01:26:27,891
you know,

2031
01:26:27,891 --> 01:26:28,221
I'd say,

2032
01:26:28,221 --> 01:26:28,341
well,

2033
01:26:28,341 --> 01:26:30,960
I'm going to pick up this needle
now I'm going to four inches.

2034
01:26:31,370 --> 01:26:32,700
And Norman one kind.

2035
01:26:33,020 --> 01:26:33,853
You go look at it,

2036
01:26:34,290 --> 01:26:35,123
you have to look at it.

2037
01:26:35,180 --> 01:26:36,890
That's the thing that
you got to look terrible,

2038
01:26:37,210 --> 01:26:38,043
right?

2039
01:26:38,140 --> 01:26:41,870
And then you dissociated from all the
terrible things you imagine if my feet,

2040
01:26:42,200 --> 01:26:44,270
and so it took about six sessions,

2041
01:26:44,271 --> 01:26:47,150
something like that before he could
go to the hospital and had a needle,

2042
01:26:47,540 --> 01:26:48,300
you feel,

2043
01:26:48,300 --> 01:26:49,370
but okay.

2044
01:26:49,690 --> 01:26:50,810
But what happened,

2045
01:26:50,840 --> 01:26:51,141
you see,

2046
01:26:51,141 --> 01:26:54,060
wasn't that he got less afraid of
needles is that he got braver about,

2047
01:26:54,280 --> 01:26:55,113
yeah.

2048
01:26:55,280 --> 01:26:56,990
So now,

2049
01:26:57,020 --> 01:26:58,050
so the first one,

2050
01:26:58,051 --> 01:26:59,290
we have to be elevated problems.

2051
01:26:59,300 --> 01:27:00,210
So this is what happens.

2052
01:27:01,090 --> 01:27:01,551
So you say,

2053
01:27:01,551 --> 01:27:02,384
well look,

2054
01:27:02,750 --> 01:27:05,840
how about looking at some pictures
of elevators and they say,

2055
01:27:05,841 --> 01:27:06,051
yeah,

2056
01:27:06,051 --> 01:27:07,100
I think I can handle that.

2057
01:27:07,250 --> 01:27:08,210
Or maybe they don't.

2058
01:27:08,510 --> 01:27:09,530
Maybe that's enough to say,

2059
01:27:09,531 --> 01:27:09,741
okay,

2060
01:27:09,741 --> 01:27:11,420
well let's look at a hundred
pictures of elevators.

2061
01:27:11,870 --> 01:27:14,170
You'll get bored of it
sooner or later and so,

2062
01:27:14,280 --> 01:27:17,120
and you want to get bored of it
because if you're bored or something,

2063
01:27:17,121 --> 01:27:18,050
you're not anxious about it.

2064
01:27:18,080 --> 01:27:18,590
So it's like,

2065
01:27:18,590 --> 01:27:19,423
well,

2066
01:27:19,610 --> 01:27:20,780
here's a picture of an elevator.

2067
01:27:21,170 --> 01:27:22,200
How are you feeling when all,

2068
01:27:22,210 --> 01:27:22,580
you know,

2069
01:27:22,580 --> 01:27:25,130
I can feel my heart rate accelerating
and I'm breathing more heavily.

2070
01:27:25,131 --> 01:27:25,401
It's like,

2071
01:27:25,401 --> 01:27:25,611
okay,

2072
01:27:25,611 --> 01:27:29,390
we'll just keep looking at
it until that stops it stop.

2073
01:27:29,570 --> 01:27:30,830
If the person doesn't run away,

2074
01:27:31,100 --> 01:27:36,060
that was talk in five minutes or so
because anxiety system sees the logic,

2075
01:27:36,170 --> 01:27:41,170
it makes all and it scans to see if
anything additionally terrible happens and

2076
01:27:42,441 --> 01:27:43,640
if answer is no,

2077
01:27:43,760 --> 01:27:44,750
then shuts down.

2078
01:27:45,470 --> 01:27:48,920
But if the answer is you run away
and the anxiety assistant things,

2079
01:27:49,040 --> 01:27:51,770
well that must be a Predator of some
sort because otherwise why would you run

2080
01:27:51,771 --> 01:27:52,550
away?

2081
01:27:52,550 --> 01:27:55,520
And so it gets a creditor then
you're afraid of it and running away.

2082
01:27:55,521 --> 01:27:56,510
And makes you more afraid.

2083
01:27:56,750 --> 01:27:58,490
So just wait it out.

2084
01:27:58,700 --> 01:27:59,910
Then you're making an event,

2085
01:27:59,940 --> 01:28:00,830
the thing you were afraid of,

2086
01:28:00,890 --> 01:28:02,090
that's what you're teaching yourself.

2087
01:28:02,650 --> 01:28:05,050
And so then maybe we'll take pictures
and then you take them in the hallway and

2088
01:28:05,051 --> 01:28:05,340
you say,

2089
01:28:05,340 --> 01:28:06,590
see that elevator over there?

2090
01:28:08,090 --> 01:28:11,540
Can you stand me this close
to it and say no or yes.

2091
01:28:11,541 --> 01:28:12,200
And if it's knowing,

2092
01:28:12,200 --> 01:28:14,090
say well we'll 10 feet farther back,

2093
01:28:14,091 --> 01:28:14,924
whatever.

2094
01:28:14,990 --> 01:28:17,630
You stand there watching
the and close for awhile.

2095
01:28:17,840 --> 01:28:20,350
Just imagine that you're near watching.

2096
01:28:20,690 --> 01:28:22,460
It's like you have to want to do that.

2097
01:28:23,090 --> 01:28:24,890
Keep your eyes focused on it,

2098
01:28:25,220 --> 01:28:26,053
going to look at,

2099
01:28:26,570 --> 01:28:28,250
we'll just feed that to your board.

2100
01:28:28,300 --> 01:28:29,240
It doesn't take very long.

2101
01:28:29,241 --> 01:28:32,100
Then you move closer to nine
five posts and then fly.

2102
01:28:32,120 --> 01:28:34,910
Keep closer to sooner than they think.

2103
01:28:35,030 --> 01:28:39,080
Almost inevitably they're like right
up on the elevator and you say,

2104
01:28:39,081 --> 01:28:40,670
well we'll let the doors open.

2105
01:28:41,190 --> 01:28:42,360
You would give you a quick look inside.

2106
01:28:42,380 --> 01:28:43,230
That would be enough for the day,

2107
01:28:43,850 --> 01:28:45,350
so it's fine.

2108
01:28:45,410 --> 01:28:48,830
So then they come back the next time
and maybe the next time you say,

2109
01:28:48,831 --> 01:28:49,041
okay,

2110
01:28:49,041 --> 01:28:49,341
look,

2111
01:28:49,341 --> 01:28:51,800
we're going to start a little
back from where we were.

2112
01:28:52,190 --> 01:28:53,130
They have to be on here.

2113
01:28:53,270 --> 01:28:54,170
I'm in a hole,

2114
01:28:54,440 --> 01:28:55,340
opened the door,

2115
01:28:56,060 --> 01:28:58,010
and you just put your head
inside and look around.

2116
01:28:58,090 --> 01:28:58,750
Look at,

2117
01:28:58,750 --> 01:28:59,481
look at the corners,

2118
01:28:59,481 --> 01:29:00,314
look at the numbers,

2119
01:29:00,380 --> 01:29:02,280
make sure you're bloody
know it where you are.

2120
01:29:02,340 --> 01:29:04,380
Is it an elevated Kenny do that?

2121
01:29:04,800 --> 01:29:05,490
Yes.

2122
01:29:05,490 --> 01:29:06,930
And he's like three sessions,

2123
01:29:06,931 --> 01:29:07,711
something like that.

2124
01:29:07,711 --> 01:29:08,790
You can get the person going down.

2125
01:29:08,810 --> 01:29:10,580
Wonderful Gentlemen speaking.

2126
01:29:12,180 --> 01:29:16,450
Now the cycle of analysts believe that
if you get behavioral treatment of a

2127
01:29:16,560 --> 01:29:17,390
phobia like that,

2128
01:29:17,390 --> 01:29:20,460
the phobia would just reappear somewhere
else because they thought the full view

2129
01:29:20,461 --> 01:29:21,720
of represented something deeper,

2130
01:29:21,721 --> 01:29:22,830
like fear of death,

2131
01:29:23,160 --> 01:29:24,300
which it actually does.

2132
01:29:24,750 --> 01:29:27,870
But it turns out that if you do
behavioral exposure like that,

2133
01:29:27,930 --> 01:29:28,763
people

2134
01:29:30,770 --> 01:29:35,770
bravery generalizes the the
doesn't bravery generalizes.

2135
01:29:36,031 --> 01:29:40,960
So one of the things that's commonly
reported among women who are treated track

2136
01:29:40,961 --> 01:29:43,740
your whole game is that they start
to fight with their husbands.

2137
01:29:46,060 --> 01:29:48,600
We convert the tendon
right there dependent.

2138
01:29:48,970 --> 01:29:51,150
They don't want their husband
to leave because they're afraid.

2139
01:29:51,300 --> 01:29:53,130
And so because they're
dependent and afraid,

2140
01:29:53,310 --> 01:29:54,840
they won't put forward what they want.

2141
01:29:55,350 --> 01:29:58,890
So then if you teach them that they're
actually tough enough to go into an

2142
01:29:58,891 --> 01:30:02,160
elevator despite being terrified of dying,

2143
01:30:02,310 --> 01:30:04,350
which is actually a pretty good
thing to learn about yourself,

2144
01:30:04,380 --> 01:30:04,531
right?

2145
01:30:04,531 --> 01:30:04,830
It's like,

2146
01:30:04,830 --> 01:30:05,160
oh,

2147
01:30:05,160 --> 01:30:05,640
the professor,

2148
01:30:05,640 --> 01:30:06,450
I can move forward,

2149
01:30:06,450 --> 01:30:07,480
just write the faculty chair.

2150
01:30:07,481 --> 01:30:09,930
Point of dying can actually
still move forward.

2151
01:30:10,110 --> 01:30:12,240
It's like there's a hell of a
lot more to me than I thought.

2152
01:30:12,650 --> 01:30:13,530
Once you know that,

2153
01:30:13,531 --> 01:30:17,730
then you can give in the taxi and you
can take the bus and you can tell your

2154
01:30:17,731 --> 01:30:20,400
husband what the hell you wanted
to tell him for the last 15 years.

2155
01:30:23,010 --> 01:30:26,190
Disruptions are secondary
to the treatment,

2156
01:30:26,610 --> 01:30:27,120
you know?

2157
01:30:27,120 --> 01:30:31,410
So the thing is is that courage
generalizes and people can be unbelievably

2158
01:30:31,411 --> 01:30:32,120
courageous.

2159
01:30:32,120 --> 01:30:33,120
And funny thing is,

2160
01:30:33,121 --> 01:30:36,150
is you don't know that
until you put yourself in a
situation where it's demanded

2161
01:30:36,151 --> 01:30:36,984
of me.

2162
01:30:37,560 --> 01:30:40,260
And so I had another client who I,

2163
01:30:40,570 --> 01:30:41,910
who was afraid of life,

2164
01:30:42,540 --> 01:30:43,770
that's really the truth.

2165
01:30:44,020 --> 01:30:45,630
And I took her to an embalming.

2166
01:30:46,570 --> 01:30:46,850
No.

2167
01:30:46,850 --> 01:30:49,800
And she was so afraid of death that
she couldn't go into a butcher store.

2168
01:30:50,430 --> 01:30:51,320
So you know,

2169
01:30:51,321 --> 01:30:52,154
in a bunch of store,

2170
01:30:52,200 --> 01:30:53,080
well you think that's pretty,

2171
01:30:53,390 --> 01:30:54,280
if you really take them out,

2172
01:30:54,330 --> 01:30:55,970
it's pretty damn protest place.

2173
01:30:56,190 --> 01:30:56,900
I mean it's,

2174
01:30:56,900 --> 01:30:58,080
it's a place of death.

2175
01:30:58,081 --> 01:31:01,560
Obviously you're blind to
them or be put in the reason.

2176
01:31:01,561 --> 01:31:02,540
But she wasn't too,

2177
01:31:02,910 --> 01:31:04,230
this is a place of death.

2178
01:31:04,231 --> 01:31:05,380
I'm not going there.

2179
01:31:06,480 --> 01:31:07,313
And

2180
01:31:08,370 --> 01:31:10,170
the consequences of that fear,

2181
01:31:10,171 --> 01:31:12,300
we're radically and destroyed her life.

2182
01:31:12,690 --> 01:31:16,190
And she had a dream that indicated
that if she didn't learn to live in the

2183
01:31:16,191 --> 01:31:16,801
slaughter house,

2184
01:31:16,801 --> 01:31:17,634
she would,

2185
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:18,930
she wouldn't survive.

2186
01:31:18,960 --> 01:31:20,260
That's basically the shows,

2187
01:31:20,300 --> 01:31:22,860
the grievant we've boiled that down to,

2188
01:31:22,920 --> 01:31:23,780
I asked her what,

2189
01:31:23,781 --> 01:31:28,781
what could we do that would be
equivalent in some sense to visiting a

2190
01:31:28,801 --> 01:31:29,350
slaughterhouse?

2191
01:31:29,350 --> 01:31:30,780
Cause that seemed to be on the question.

2192
01:31:31,320 --> 01:31:31,651
She said,

2193
01:31:31,651 --> 01:31:33,090
well I'd like to see him in bombing

2194
01:31:35,610 --> 01:31:37,560
the hell it was going to arrange that.

2195
01:31:37,561 --> 01:31:42,210
But it turns [inaudible] partner and you
tell the people there and if you have

2196
01:31:42,211 --> 01:31:45,660
someone who's terrified of death and that
they need to do something about that,

2197
01:31:45,661 --> 01:31:49,860
that people who work in the funeral parlor
fraction point dealing with that and

2198
01:31:49,861 --> 01:31:52,470
then people would work
there in incredible they do.

2199
01:31:53,420 --> 01:31:55,230
They deal with death all the time,

2200
01:31:55,490 --> 01:31:55,770
right?

2201
01:31:55,770 --> 01:31:56,401
All the time.

2202
01:31:56,401 --> 01:32:00,880
They deal with death and grief
all the time and they do it.

2203
01:32:02,940 --> 01:32:05,880
It's unbelievable what they can do that
and people who will tell you a terrible

2204
01:32:05,890 --> 01:32:09,010
words do that for people who work in
emergency words and people who are

2205
01:32:09,011 --> 01:32:11,210
paramedics there like facing this,

2206
01:32:11,280 --> 01:32:16,280
why do you castrophe just never now
in a never ending parade calamity.

2207
01:32:17,590 --> 01:32:18,423
And they do it.

2208
01:32:18,940 --> 01:32:20,680
It's like people are pretty damn tough.

2209
01:32:20,880 --> 01:32:21,670
You know,

2210
01:32:21,670 --> 01:32:22,503
so,

2211
01:32:23,420 --> 01:32:24,910
so that's a pretty remarkable thing.

2212
01:32:25,210 --> 01:32:26,150
And so see,

2213
01:32:26,170 --> 01:32:27,650
I need to get past with one tonight.

2214
01:32:31,460 --> 01:32:32,293
So

2215
01:32:35,470 --> 01:32:37,060
I guess each of the rules in the booker,

2216
01:32:37,700 --> 01:32:38,800
the time contain each other,

2217
01:32:38,980 --> 01:32:39,950
each other rules.

2218
01:32:40,180 --> 01:32:43,270
That's one way of thinking about the
motifs are quite similar as we worked in

2219
01:32:43,271 --> 01:32:48,090
the choppers and the fundamental motif
of the book is something might go wrong.

2220
01:32:48,180 --> 01:32:52,450
What I just laid out is that
this is a message of optimism.

2221
01:32:52,451 --> 01:32:55,060
And I actually think this is why so
many people are watching my lectures.

2222
01:32:55,060 --> 01:32:55,930
As far as I can tell,

2223
01:32:57,100 --> 01:32:58,060
I'm a dark guy,

2224
01:32:58,120 --> 01:32:58,450
man,

2225
01:32:58,450 --> 01:33:00,580
and I have a really optimistic idea,

2226
01:33:01,180 --> 01:33:01,421
you know,

2227
01:33:01,421 --> 01:33:02,740
because I've spent my whole,

2228
01:33:02,741 --> 01:33:06,010
life's got in the worst possible things
that people can do to each other.

2229
01:33:06,400 --> 01:33:09,310
And you're are things that people do
meet each other that are so bad that you

2230
01:33:09,311 --> 01:33:10,060
just cannot,

2231
01:33:10,060 --> 01:33:11,250
you can't even imagine it.

2232
01:33:11,620 --> 01:33:14,320
And that's a rough thing to say
because like we have kind of a logical

2233
01:33:14,321 --> 01:33:15,154
imaginations.

2234
01:33:15,280 --> 01:33:17,050
And if you let those some things cycle,

2235
01:33:17,140 --> 01:33:19,030
you can imagine it's a
pretty dreadful things.

2236
01:33:19,330 --> 01:33:20,081
But believe me,

2237
01:33:20,081 --> 01:33:22,090
there are things that people
have done to each other that,

2238
01:33:22,710 --> 01:33:25,570
that a normal person
could not imagine do it.

2239
01:33:25,600 --> 01:33:27,180
And there are things I've read,

2240
01:33:27,190 --> 01:33:31,120
especially about what happened when the
Japanese invaded China in World War Two

2241
01:33:31,121 --> 01:33:36,121
because are so dark that you can't read
them without being permanently affected

2242
01:33:36,131 --> 01:33:36,964
by it.

2243
01:33:37,030 --> 01:33:37,781
And you know,

2244
01:33:37,781 --> 01:33:40,810
I've helped lots of people through very
difficult periods of their lives and

2245
01:33:41,350 --> 01:33:45,750
spend a lot of time studying totalitarian
atrocity on the right and the left,

2246
01:33:45,751 --> 01:33:46,510
it's like,

2247
01:33:46,510 --> 01:33:48,130
it's pretty damn harsh,

2248
01:33:48,670 --> 01:33:49,300
you know?

2249
01:33:49,300 --> 01:33:53,950
But what I've come out and from
that [inaudible] Carl Young,

2250
01:33:53,951 --> 01:33:54,784
new something,

2251
01:33:54,880 --> 01:33:55,750
his Motif,

2252
01:33:55,751 --> 01:33:56,790
it was an l chemical,

2253
01:33:56,800 --> 01:33:59,150
a little team fee derived from
the study about him helping me.

2254
01:33:59,151 --> 01:34:00,480
I was up lacked.

2255
01:34:00,481 --> 01:34:03,520
It's a lot to move teeth instruct
William has been given a tour,

2256
01:34:03,820 --> 01:34:08,080
which means that which you most need will
be filed where you least want to look.

2257
01:34:09,160 --> 01:34:10,360
And that's a hell of a tank.

2258
01:34:10,570 --> 01:34:13,330
That's the barrier to
enlightenment because they think,

2259
01:34:13,331 --> 01:34:15,300
well perhaps even could be enlightened.

2260
01:34:15,910 --> 01:34:16,061
Well,

2261
01:34:16,061 --> 01:34:20,260
what stopped me following your
bliss as Joseph Campbell said,

2262
01:34:20,480 --> 01:34:20,950
um,

2263
01:34:20,950 --> 01:34:21,970
I guess he revised that.

2264
01:34:21,971 --> 01:34:22,920
I've heard that the other day.

2265
01:34:22,921 --> 01:34:27,921
Who a follow your blisters just actually
said that knowing that you may be

2266
01:34:28,031 --> 01:34:30,020
glossed over the problem a bit too Glib,

2267
01:34:30,440 --> 01:34:32,080
but that wasn't the Carl,

2268
01:34:32,081 --> 01:34:32,620
you don't it.

2269
01:34:32,620 --> 01:34:34,360
Our idea was even new thing.

2270
01:34:34,510 --> 01:34:35,350
Do what's meaningful.

2271
01:34:35,360 --> 01:34:37,360
And truthfully we'll take
him to do some really,

2272
01:34:37,361 --> 01:34:40,700
really dark places and that was
straightened you the hell out.

2273
01:34:41,350 --> 01:34:42,340
And that's about right.

2274
01:34:42,460 --> 01:34:47,460
And so what I found by investigating
the darkness was that it clarified the

2275
01:34:47,951 --> 01:34:49,030
light at the same time.

2276
01:34:49,480 --> 01:34:50,171
It makes sense,

2277
01:34:50,171 --> 01:34:50,441
right?

2278
01:34:50,441 --> 01:34:51,760
Because it makes sense.

2279
01:34:52,060 --> 01:34:54,610
How could you understand good and
you've got to understand that evil.

2280
01:34:55,270 --> 01:35:00,270
And if you don't think there's evil though
and God help you because one day and

2281
01:35:02,180 --> 01:35:03,680
they will tear you into pieces.

2282
01:35:04,070 --> 01:35:06,620
And that happens to people far
more frequently than you think.

2283
01:35:06,830 --> 01:35:08,060
In my clinical experience,

2284
01:35:08,061 --> 01:35:13,061
I've never seen someone with posttraumatic
stress post traumatic stress disorder

2285
01:35:13,790 --> 01:35:15,430
who hadn't encountered people.

2286
01:35:16,400 --> 01:35:20,540
That's what causes post traumatic
stress disorder is a trauma.

2287
01:35:21,760 --> 01:35:23,000
Kids fall and break the makes.

2288
01:35:23,001 --> 01:35:24,860
They don't get post
traumatic stress disorder.

2289
01:35:25,340 --> 01:35:25,730
You,

2290
01:35:25,730 --> 01:35:26,150
you,

2291
01:35:26,150 --> 01:35:29,660
you're naive on some part of your
life and you hit someone who's MLevel.

2292
01:35:29,810 --> 01:35:30,800
Maybe it's you,

2293
01:35:31,310 --> 01:35:34,940
because that's often across
a posttraumatic stress
disorder to among soldiers in

2294
01:35:34,941 --> 01:35:35,720
particular,

2295
01:35:35,720 --> 01:35:39,590
they watched themselves to a sub doing
something they cannot imagine that they

2296
01:35:39,591 --> 01:35:41,410
could do and they do it.

2297
01:35:42,290 --> 01:35:43,400
They never recovered from that.

2298
01:35:44,120 --> 01:35:44,953
So,

2299
01:35:46,370 --> 01:35:51,290
so we know the world is a tragic place
and it's a level of place and we each

2300
01:35:51,291 --> 01:35:54,980
have our personal tragedy in our
family tragedy and reach carriers of

2301
01:35:54,981 --> 01:35:55,820
malevolence and,

2302
01:35:56,110 --> 01:35:56,900
and,

2303
01:35:56,900 --> 01:35:57,710
and recipients,

2304
01:35:57,710 --> 01:35:58,010
Sukkot.

2305
01:35:58,010 --> 01:36:00,240
And that's the landscape
of reality in a sense.

2306
01:36:00,470 --> 01:36:01,700
But there are,

2307
01:36:02,420 --> 01:36:07,420
there are modes of conducting yourself
in the world that are more powerful then

2308
01:36:09,080 --> 01:36:13,370
tragedy and evil and
those involved courage.

2309
01:36:13,400 --> 01:36:16,460
So that's the first thing that the courage
is something like the willingness to

2310
01:36:17,090 --> 01:36:21,890
voluntarily take on the burden of the
tragedy and the level to accept it rather

2311
01:36:21,891 --> 01:36:22,730
than to fight it,

2312
01:36:23,340 --> 01:36:25,100
except as a condition of being.

2313
01:36:25,160 --> 01:36:26,000
It's something like that.

2314
01:36:26,300 --> 01:36:28,080
You have to accept it
as a condition of being.

2315
01:36:29,040 --> 01:36:29,750
Um,

2316
01:36:29,750 --> 01:36:34,750
I read this really interesting
old Jewish all monetary years ago.

2317
01:36:35,571 --> 01:36:36,710
I don't even remember the source,

2318
01:36:36,711 --> 01:36:40,700
but it was one of the most brilliant
things I've ever read that the commentator

2319
01:36:41,390 --> 01:36:42,171
was discussing.

2320
01:36:42,171 --> 01:36:43,790
The classical attributes of God,

2321
01:36:44,030 --> 01:36:44,721
omniscience,

2322
01:36:44,721 --> 01:36:45,554
omnipotence,

2323
01:36:45,860 --> 01:36:46,693
omnipresence,

2324
01:36:47,050 --> 01:36:47,990
so that's everything.

2325
01:36:47,991 --> 01:36:48,824
Fundamentally,

2326
01:36:48,870 --> 01:36:51,500
the question was what does it being,

2327
01:36:51,501 --> 01:36:52,310
it's omniscient,

2328
01:36:52,310 --> 01:36:53,143
omnipresent,

2329
01:36:53,570 --> 01:36:54,980
and omniscient.

2330
01:36:55,310 --> 01:36:57,860
Black and obvious answers.

2331
01:36:58,640 --> 01:36:59,473
Nothing.

2332
01:37:00,170 --> 01:37:01,250
That's not the correct answer.

2333
01:37:01,251 --> 01:37:02,660
The correct answer is a limitation.

2334
01:37:04,720 --> 01:37:05,600
That's so amazing.

2335
01:37:05,690 --> 01:37:10,670
That's an amazing thing is that limitation
has advantages that totality lacks

2336
01:37:11,360 --> 01:37:12,760
limitation in,

2337
01:37:12,761 --> 01:37:14,120
so something to struggle against.

2338
01:37:14,121 --> 01:37:14,980
Limitation Needs.

2339
01:37:15,010 --> 01:37:16,220
There's a place to go.

2340
01:37:16,670 --> 01:37:17,503
There's an op,

2341
01:37:17,720 --> 01:37:18,560
there's a story,

2342
01:37:18,680 --> 01:37:19,520
here's an adventure.

2343
01:37:19,550 --> 01:37:21,050
All of that requires an invitation,

2344
01:37:21,290 --> 01:37:22,000
not it's life.

2345
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:22,730
It's an,

2346
01:37:22,730 --> 01:37:26,100
it's an adventure of sorts and
it's like it's a terrible venture.

2347
01:37:26,101 --> 01:37:29,780
It's a high stakes adventure because
you're all in and down whether you like it

2348
01:37:29,781 --> 01:37:30,320
or not.

2349
01:37:30,320 --> 01:37:31,153
You're all in.

2350
01:37:32,090 --> 01:37:32,990
That's the adventure.

2351
01:37:33,130 --> 01:37:33,831
Then the question is,

2352
01:37:33,831 --> 01:37:35,900
what is it worth it and then the crest,

2353
01:37:35,990 --> 01:37:37,900
the answer that might be
looked depends on the quest,

2354
01:37:38,750 --> 01:37:39,020
right?

2355
01:37:39,020 --> 01:37:39,920
Maybe that's the answer.

2356
01:37:39,921 --> 01:37:41,570
It's like if the quest is sufficient,

2357
01:37:41,571 --> 01:37:43,340
then the adventure is worth it.

2358
01:37:44,030 --> 01:37:47,120
And so that's the only optimistic talk
that I've ever come across that actually

2359
01:37:47,121 --> 01:37:47,954
believe

2360
01:37:49,180 --> 01:37:50,120
that could be true.

2361
01:37:50,470 --> 01:37:51,710
It seems like that if,

2362
01:37:51,860 --> 01:37:52,640
if you live that out,

2363
01:37:52,640 --> 01:37:52,991
you're like,

2364
01:37:52,991 --> 01:37:53,261
you know,

2365
01:37:53,261 --> 01:37:56,000
sometimes you have these where you
pick off was really worthwhile.

2366
01:37:56,720 --> 01:37:57,070
Anything.

2367
01:37:57,070 --> 01:37:58,080
What does that mean?

2368
01:37:58,570 --> 01:37:58,800
Well,

2369
01:37:58,800 --> 01:38:02,640
despite the terrible preconditions of Ba,

2370
01:38:03,810 --> 01:38:06,180
that seemed to announce
itself as valuable.

2371
01:38:06,450 --> 01:38:06,721
Okay,

2372
01:38:06,721 --> 01:38:09,150
well what if that was your
pursuit periods you can file.

2373
01:38:09,151 --> 01:38:13,170
I'm going to pursue what I regard
as the most valuable thing,

2374
01:38:13,440 --> 01:38:17,670
going to dedicate myself towards that
so that I have the adventure of my life

2375
01:38:17,790 --> 01:38:21,360
that justifies the suffering
of my life and the malevolence.

2376
01:38:21,361 --> 01:38:26,040
That's part and parcel of part and parcel
of the discuss the aim so far up that

2377
01:38:26,041 --> 01:38:27,210
the trip is worthwhile.

2378
01:38:29,390 --> 01:38:34,390
There's absolutely every reason to believe
that that's a proper answer like it

2379
01:38:37,471 --> 01:38:38,400
looks like it is.

2380
01:38:38,510 --> 01:38:40,050
What would be great stories say,

2381
01:38:40,980 --> 01:38:41,191
oh,

2382
01:38:41,191 --> 01:38:42,720
that's what the great efforts to say.

2383
01:38:43,230 --> 01:38:46,920
That's what the archetypes demonstrate.

2384
01:38:47,160 --> 01:38:49,560
That's what the neurobiology suggests.

2385
01:38:49,890 --> 01:38:51,420
That's what our agenda is,

2386
01:38:51,421 --> 01:38:56,280
to produce political structures that
are stable and relationships that work

2387
01:38:56,400 --> 01:38:59,010
suggested because you treat
each other in a relationship.

2388
01:38:59,011 --> 01:38:59,844
Because if,

2389
01:38:59,850 --> 01:39:00,720
if you love someone,

2390
01:39:00,721 --> 01:39:04,060
you treat that person as if the
adventure of their life is worthwhile.

2391
01:39:04,200 --> 01:39:05,011
If something like that,

2392
01:39:05,011 --> 01:39:05,711
he wouldn't love him.

2393
01:39:05,711 --> 01:39:07,530
If he didn't think that would do,

2394
01:39:07,550 --> 01:39:07,860
you would,

2395
01:39:07,860 --> 01:39:10,590
if you didn't think it was
worthwhile for them to be,

2396
01:39:10,620 --> 01:39:11,530
you would love them.

2397
01:39:11,531 --> 01:39:12,820
And so it's,

2398
01:39:13,030 --> 01:39:14,760
it's a judgment call you make.

2399
01:39:15,030 --> 01:39:15,361
It's like,

2400
01:39:15,361 --> 01:39:17,510
well it seems to me that it's
a big time for everybody.

2401
01:39:17,530 --> 01:39:22,290
Wake up and realize that life is
terrible and worse than you can possibly

2402
01:39:22,291 --> 01:39:22,700
imagine.

2403
01:39:22,700 --> 01:39:23,510
The history,

2404
01:39:23,510 --> 01:39:25,710
absolutely mad house tasks,

2405
01:39:26,580 --> 01:39:31,580
but the nobility of the human spirit
and the power of courage and truth is

2406
01:39:32,791 --> 01:39:36,390
sufficient to to transcend all of that.

2407
01:39:36,450 --> 01:39:38,460
And I think that's true individually,

2408
01:39:38,461 --> 01:39:39,870
like in the confines of your own life.

2409
01:39:40,080 --> 01:39:43,740
I think it's true for your family because
you can have a beneficial effect on

2410
01:39:43,741 --> 01:39:44,520
your family.

2411
01:39:44,520 --> 01:39:47,730
I think it's true for you in
relationship to the community.

2412
01:39:47,910 --> 01:39:52,910
And I have a sneaking suspicion now and
this is when my thought goes beyond its

2413
01:39:52,951 --> 01:39:57,500
ability to justify itself because it's
more of an intermission or founded

2414
01:39:57,501 --> 01:39:58,320
tuition,

2415
01:39:58,320 --> 01:40:02,520
but you can set yourself together so well
and if you start pulling other things

2416
01:40:02,730 --> 01:40:06,700
outside of the family and the
community together properly around it.

2417
01:40:06,720 --> 01:40:09,340
So they started to line up so that
everything starts to alignment,

2418
01:40:09,350 --> 01:40:12,540
Blaine up and come together
like something symphonic.

2419
01:40:13,360 --> 01:40:17,220
And we don't understand the relationship
between consciousness and reality very

2420
01:40:17,221 --> 01:40:17,450
well.

2421
01:40:17,450 --> 01:40:20,940
Cause obviously you're a
reciprocal relationship and
it's possible that each of

2422
01:40:20,941 --> 01:40:24,960
us play a much more fundamental role in
the structure of being than any of us

2423
01:40:24,961 --> 01:40:26,130
really realize.

2424
01:40:26,520 --> 01:40:27,353
We're certainly,

2425
01:40:28,020 --> 01:40:30,990
we certainly are far more
than we can understand.

2426
01:40:31,680 --> 01:40:33,030
What the hell do we know about themselves?

2427
01:40:33,050 --> 01:40:34,140
What's important help to get?

2428
01:40:34,141 --> 01:40:35,900
It's just like,

2429
01:40:35,910 --> 01:40:36,930
what are we exactly.

2430
01:40:37,950 --> 01:40:42,950
Well I'd be fun to find out
and the alternative seems
to be some bit of Kale and

2431
01:40:44,431 --> 01:40:46,130
so you know why not a,

2432
01:40:48,300 --> 01:40:50,640
so it's probably a good place to stop.

2433
01:40:50,690 --> 01:40:51,061
And we say,

2434
01:40:51,061 --> 01:40:52,380
well why the hell not eight months?

2435
01:40:53,910 --> 01:40:54,060
That

2436
01:40:54,060 --> 01:40:54,670
would be really good.

2437
01:40:54,670 --> 01:40:56,050
And I think everybody's ready for it.

2438
01:40:56,051 --> 01:40:58,240
So let's let you go do it.

2439
01:40:58,390 --> 01:40:59,350
Truth and courage.

2440
01:40:59,540 --> 01:41:00,550
That would be a good thing.

2441
01:41:00,960 --> 01:41:01,793
So thank you.

2442
01:41:02,650 --> 01:41:07,650
[inaudible]

2443
01:42:58,950 --> 01:43:00,780
never talked your mom.

2444
01:43:03,280 --> 01:43:08,280
So when you go in front of a crowd in
silence until everyone from little bit

2445
01:43:09,730 --> 01:43:10,563
wondering,

2446
01:43:15,270 --> 01:43:15,870
okay,

2447
01:43:15,870 --> 01:43:16,703
so

2448
01:43:20,020 --> 01:43:22,980
you won't know whether it be

2449
01:43:25,070 --> 01:43:26,010
do to the questions.

2450
01:43:26,030 --> 01:43:26,863
We can have more room.

2451
01:43:48,950 --> 01:43:49,930
That's where you have to drink.

2452
01:43:49,940 --> 01:43:50,910
[inaudible]

2453
01:44:03,130 --> 01:44:07,200
there have been moments
where I've had brief spells,

2454
01:44:07,980 --> 01:44:09,100
sort of bliss

2455
01:44:10,660 --> 01:44:14,210
and it's really easy for me to be
cynical because when I'm there I'm always

2456
01:44:14,211 --> 01:44:15,100
looking at people and think,

2457
01:44:16,450 --> 01:44:17,283
oh it's just switching.

2458
01:44:17,380 --> 01:44:18,730
It's found a good wave or

2459
01:44:20,930 --> 01:44:21,521
something like that.

2460
01:44:21,521 --> 01:44:25,670
But there might be
something where it's like,

2461
01:44:26,170 --> 01:44:27,880
it's like a dark spot on the map.

2462
01:44:28,940 --> 01:44:31,490
And so I was wondering more generally,

2463
01:44:31,491 --> 01:44:35,860
how can you distinguish between a cave
that's empty and became the head of the

2464
01:44:35,861 --> 01:44:40,861
dragon in it and also what
you've generally three to
buy my books [inaudible]

2465
01:44:49,861 --> 01:44:50,694
books,

2466
01:44:51,010 --> 01:44:52,230
they're more of a microcosm,

2467
01:45:06,040 --> 01:45:08,190
probably generally in favor of the

2468
01:45:11,460 --> 01:45:16,460
dangerous mean alcohol is dangerous
and sex is dangerous and all of that,

2469
01:45:16,791 --> 01:45:20,650
but we can't regulate any of that too
tightly because pending regulation it's be

2470
01:45:20,660 --> 01:45:22,030
more dangerous than the danger.

2471
01:45:22,900 --> 01:45:24,050
That's the big girl.

2472
01:45:27,680 --> 01:45:30,120
One possible solution to that

2473
01:45:32,210 --> 01:45:33,043
is

2474
01:45:34,590 --> 01:45:36,300
there's a chapter in this book,

2475
01:45:36,870 --> 01:45:39,620
this chapter can be
precise in your speech,

2476
01:45:40,420 --> 01:45:41,390
and it was a fun chapter,

2477
01:45:41,391 --> 01:45:41,781
Greg,

2478
01:45:41,781 --> 01:45:42,950
because it's a

2479
01:45:44,630 --> 01:45:49,630
description of how what you're aiming
app determines your world and I didn't

2480
01:45:53,361 --> 01:45:54,194
want me,

2481
01:45:54,220 --> 01:45:55,730
and that's kind of a metaphor you know,

2482
01:45:56,200 --> 01:45:57,033
is to lead,

2483
01:45:57,230 --> 01:45:58,063
for example,

2484
01:45:58,820 --> 01:46:02,270
the reality that you wouldn't have
heard is Maya or illusion that you're

2485
01:46:02,271 --> 01:46:05,270
suffering as a consequence of
being mired in that illusion.

2486
01:46:05,720 --> 01:46:08,510
And there's some real
truth to that because

2487
01:46:10,430 --> 01:46:12,920
one does determine how
the world manifest itself.

2488
01:46:14,070 --> 01:46:14,870
No,

2489
01:46:14,870 --> 01:46:16,120
it's not the only determinant,

2490
01:46:16,350 --> 01:46:16,590
you know,

2491
01:46:16,590 --> 01:46:18,450
because we really are
limited in some ways,

2492
01:46:18,470 --> 01:46:19,303
right?

2493
01:46:19,790 --> 01:46:20,690
We can bouncing along.

2494
01:46:20,691 --> 01:46:21,890
Quite happy with leaving everything,

2495
01:46:21,920 --> 01:46:22,753
right?

2496
01:46:22,980 --> 01:46:23,330
No,

2497
01:46:23,330 --> 01:46:25,550
there's an earthquake in
that telling falls on you.

2498
01:46:25,551 --> 01:46:26,470
And that's the exact,

2499
01:46:26,900 --> 01:46:29,450
so what can you founded
by your mortality of,

2500
01:46:29,451 --> 01:46:30,560
within that you have,

2501
01:46:32,190 --> 01:46:33,023
what would you say?

2502
01:46:33,620 --> 01:46:38,620
You have a landscape shorts and then
the way that landscape manifests itself

2503
01:46:40,890 --> 01:46:45,170
isn't no trivial manner
determined what you're aiming at.

2504
01:46:46,190 --> 01:46:47,720
So there's a story in that chapter,

2505
01:46:47,721 --> 01:46:48,554
but this woman,

2506
01:46:49,620 --> 01:46:49,980
she needs

2507
01:46:49,980 --> 01:46:51,610
a psychiatrist at a party,

2508
01:46:51,860 --> 01:46:55,700
if I remember correctly from a play
called the car feel party by DSL.

2509
01:46:55,760 --> 01:46:56,593
Yeah.

2510
01:46:57,030 --> 01:46:59,770
She tells the psychiatrist that
her life is going very well,

2511
01:46:59,771 --> 01:47:01,770
but she's suffering and you know,

2512
01:47:01,771 --> 01:47:06,480
thinking dark thoughts about how terrible
things are and she's hoping that he

2513
01:47:06,481 --> 01:47:07,081
could help her.

2514
01:47:07,081 --> 01:47:08,130
But before

2515
01:47:09,630 --> 01:47:10,411
she gets to that,

2516
01:47:10,411 --> 01:47:11,244
she says,

2517
01:47:11,940 --> 01:47:15,510
I really hope there's something
wrong with 10 the sidecar just says,

2518
01:47:15,600 --> 01:47:15,990
well,

2519
01:47:15,990 --> 01:47:16,823
what do you mean?

2520
01:47:16,830 --> 01:47:17,130
What do you,

2521
01:47:17,130 --> 01:47:18,460
why do you hope there's
something wrong with him?

2522
01:47:18,470 --> 01:47:19,410
Because she says,

2523
01:47:19,411 --> 01:47:19,801
well look,

2524
01:47:19,801 --> 01:47:21,210
I'm suffering badly.

2525
01:47:21,600 --> 01:47:23,670
And as far as I can tell,

2526
01:47:23,671 --> 01:47:25,230
there's only two possible
reasons for that.

2527
01:47:25,231 --> 01:47:27,390
One is something wrong with the world.

2528
01:47:27,391 --> 01:47:29,940
And I'm just stuck with that
and hence the suffering.

2529
01:47:29,970 --> 01:47:33,450
Or maybe there's something wrong with
me and that would be way better because

2530
01:47:33,451 --> 01:47:34,284
then I get both.

2531
01:47:34,380 --> 01:47:35,610
I'm not going to fix the world.

2532
01:47:35,720 --> 01:47:36,400
I can pull cash.

2533
01:47:36,400 --> 01:47:37,440
We fixed me.

2534
01:47:37,441 --> 01:47:39,180
And in some of the suffering that go away,

2535
01:47:39,690 --> 01:47:40,290
it's like,

2536
01:47:40,290 --> 01:47:41,670
and then when I read that,

2537
01:47:41,730 --> 01:47:45,780
I also thought about what
happened repeatedly in the
old testament because what

2538
01:47:45,781 --> 01:47:49,170
happened to the old testament repeatedly
is that the Israelites kind of get

2539
01:47:49,171 --> 01:47:50,004
their act together.

2540
01:47:50,370 --> 01:47:50,830
You know,

2541
01:47:50,830 --> 01:47:51,900
we sort of get things going.

2542
01:47:51,910 --> 01:47:52,920
Then they get all arrogant,

2543
01:47:53,440 --> 01:47:54,350
started breaking roles,

2544
01:47:54,400 --> 01:47:59,400
and then God comes along and just
walks them centuries lacking.

2545
01:47:59,830 --> 01:48:03,190
Then they gonna slowly get
themselves off the floor,

2546
01:48:03,810 --> 01:48:04,650
climb up again,

2547
01:48:04,670 --> 01:48:05,650
and then they get all arrogant.

2548
01:48:06,150 --> 01:48:07,380
They're flat and again.

2549
01:48:07,470 --> 01:48:10,660
But what's really interesting is
for the rise in the flatmates,

2550
01:48:10,680 --> 01:48:12,810
which is kind of part and parcel of life,

2551
01:48:12,811 --> 01:48:14,700
but the Israelites to response to that,

2552
01:48:14,730 --> 01:48:16,800
which is always to blame
themselves and not go up.

2553
01:48:17,630 --> 01:48:20,820
That's one of the things that makes that
book so unbelievably rock solid as the

2554
01:48:20,830 --> 01:48:25,800
hazard lights always think no catastrophe
because we didn't do things great

2555
01:48:26,700 --> 01:48:28,710
catastrophe because we
didn't do things right.

2556
01:48:28,770 --> 01:48:30,750
It's like even if that's not true,

2557
01:48:31,550 --> 01:48:32,910
yes it is true,

2558
01:48:33,240 --> 01:48:34,470
but even if it's not true,

2559
01:48:34,800 --> 01:48:36,060
it's like it's pretty good attitude.

2560
01:48:36,860 --> 01:48:38,250
It's a pretty good attitude to have.

2561
01:48:38,251 --> 01:48:38,600
It's like,

2562
01:48:38,600 --> 01:48:42,430
well you know even I have noticed this
when people are negotiating with their

2563
01:48:42,930 --> 01:48:46,650
partner to say it's like if you're
having a real dispute with your partner,

2564
01:48:46,860 --> 01:48:50,610
one really effective technique is to
separate cause like you have this dispute,

2565
01:48:50,670 --> 01:48:53,190
you're trying to hammer
each other's like separate,

2566
01:48:53,400 --> 01:48:54,930
go sit on a bed somewhere and think,

2567
01:48:54,931 --> 01:48:55,764
okay,

2568
01:48:56,880 --> 01:49:00,470
despite the fact that I'm married to the
most annoying person in the world and

2569
01:49:02,940 --> 01:49:03,900
in this instance,

2570
01:49:04,320 --> 01:49:08,610
is there anything that I've done no
matter how trivial in the last months that

2571
01:49:08,850 --> 01:49:12,060
have made this stupid
situation or probable.

2572
01:49:12,750 --> 01:49:14,700
And like if you ask
yourself that question,

2573
01:49:14,760 --> 01:49:19,760
take about 15 seconds to figure out other
dumb things you've done the optimum,

2574
01:49:20,340 --> 01:49:24,180
they'll come forward pretty
much in a never ending stream.

2575
01:49:25,100 --> 01:49:27,300
If people tell your partner,

2576
01:49:27,510 --> 01:49:27,960
you know,

2577
01:49:27,960 --> 01:49:28,793
yeah,

2578
01:49:29,040 --> 01:49:31,560
I'm not very far with you at the
moment and for sure you're wrong,

2579
01:49:31,561 --> 01:49:34,710
but here's some really
stupid things I've done.

2580
01:49:35,010 --> 01:49:35,610
Then they're,

2581
01:49:35,610 --> 01:49:39,260
they tend to be a lot happier
with you if you do the same thing.

2582
01:49:39,410 --> 01:49:41,130
We tend to be a lot happier with them.

2583
01:49:41,340 --> 01:49:45,660
So there's some utility in figuring out
what it is that you're doing to muck up

2584
01:49:45,661 --> 01:49:46,291
the situation.

2585
01:49:46,291 --> 01:49:49,770
So one of the things I would say with
regards to the nightclub situations,

2586
01:49:50,260 --> 01:49:55,060
maybe it's miserable because what you
want when you go there isn't right.

2587
01:49:56,080 --> 01:49:57,430
And so what I would say like,

2588
01:49:57,431 --> 01:49:59,710
and if we were talking about
this in a therapy session,

2589
01:49:59,740 --> 01:50:00,341
like I would say,

2590
01:50:00,341 --> 01:50:01,150
well let's,

2591
01:50:01,150 --> 01:50:03,910
let's lay out what it is
that you're searching for.

2592
01:50:03,911 --> 01:50:05,740
When you go there and you could write,

2593
01:50:05,741 --> 01:50:08,710
you'd have to kind of write approximations
because you might not actually know.

2594
01:50:08,740 --> 01:50:09,820
You kind of have some idea,

2595
01:50:09,821 --> 01:50:10,810
but you wouldn't exactly know.

2596
01:50:10,811 --> 01:50:11,171
It's okay,

2597
01:50:11,171 --> 01:50:13,180
let's figure out what
it is that you're after.

2598
01:50:14,100 --> 01:50:14,481
That's great.

2599
01:50:14,481 --> 01:50:16,690
You got a bunch of things that
you could be after otherwise.

2600
01:50:17,200 --> 01:50:20,800
And then let's send you to the nightclub
and 10 times and with these different

2601
01:50:20,801 --> 01:50:22,540
attitudes in mind and see what happens.

2602
01:50:22,690 --> 01:50:24,820
That's called collaborative
empiricism by the way.

2603
01:50:24,821 --> 01:50:26,770
It's a behavioral technique
and it's a good one.

2604
01:50:27,130 --> 01:50:27,850
So I would say,

2605
01:50:27,850 --> 01:50:30,370
well vary your approach.

2606
01:50:31,510 --> 01:50:31,721
You know,

2607
01:50:31,721 --> 01:50:32,680
maybe your approach wasn't,

2608
01:50:32,690 --> 01:50:34,900
I could meet to well to,

2609
01:50:34,901 --> 01:50:36,100
to you know,

2610
01:50:36,101 --> 01:50:38,560
to dance 30% more than you usually would.

2611
01:50:39,130 --> 01:50:40,690
You'd have to leave everything out of it.

2612
01:50:40,990 --> 01:50:41,900
Everything else out of it,

2613
01:50:41,901 --> 01:50:42,340
right?

2614
01:50:42,340 --> 01:50:42,881
It can't be,

2615
01:50:42,881 --> 01:50:43,714
well,

2616
01:50:43,780 --> 01:50:47,950
I'm trying to find a partner for
casual sex and that's really my end,

2617
01:50:48,010 --> 01:50:53,010
but I'm going to pretend that my aim
is to dance like 30% no wrong jack,

2618
01:50:53,950 --> 01:50:57,450
you haven't played the game strength
or maybe it's to have three engaging

2619
01:50:57,460 --> 01:50:58,150
conversation.

2620
01:50:58,150 --> 01:51:01,720
So if you could quantify it like that
and it's kind of trait in some sense,

2621
01:51:01,721 --> 01:51:05,500
but you're obviously not a pro at the
nightclub while you're on this mission

2622
01:51:05,530 --> 01:51:07,510
because it's not working out
for you the way and didn't mind.

2623
01:51:07,840 --> 01:51:12,130
So are you're saying change
your goals and see what happens.

2624
01:51:12,910 --> 01:51:17,410
So because perhaps what to pursuing
there isn't the right thing to pursue.

2625
01:51:18,280 --> 01:51:19,290
It's highly grown,

2626
01:51:19,560 --> 01:51:20,070
right?

2627
01:51:20,070 --> 01:51:25,070
[inaudible]

2628
01:51:28,320 --> 01:51:28,691
I'd like,

2629
01:51:28,691 --> 01:51:31,030
it isn't obvious what you
should be pursuing them,

2630
01:51:31,540 --> 01:51:32,720
but then I would say it's true.

2631
01:51:32,920 --> 01:51:33,830
It's because,

2632
01:51:34,030 --> 01:51:35,830
and I was very complex landscape,

2633
01:51:35,910 --> 01:51:36,131
right?

2634
01:51:36,131 --> 01:51:36,820
It's uh,

2635
01:51:36,820 --> 01:51:39,940
it's amazing the mark and it's,

2636
01:51:39,941 --> 01:51:40,900
it's accelerating.

2637
01:51:40,901 --> 01:51:42,300
Maybe market some sense.

2638
01:51:42,380 --> 01:51:42,731
You might say,

2639
01:51:42,731 --> 01:51:42,851
well,

2640
01:51:42,851 --> 01:51:46,090
what's on the optimal behavior and the
landscape that's an accelerator mating

2641
01:51:46,091 --> 01:51:46,924
market.

2642
01:51:47,410 --> 01:51:48,660
Well that's,

2643
01:51:48,970 --> 01:51:50,710
you can think about that for five years.

2644
01:51:51,250 --> 01:51:53,530
The pickup harvest types are
trying to figure that out too,

2645
01:51:53,531 --> 01:51:58,360
but because they felt they
knew is manifesting a persona
that's associated with

2646
01:51:58,361 --> 01:52:01,750
success in a rapidly
accelerated meaty market,

2647
01:52:02,140 --> 01:52:03,370
but they're not doing the real thing.

2648
01:52:03,371 --> 01:52:03,491
You know,

2649
01:52:03,491 --> 01:52:06,160
basically dance Lou more
complicated than that,

2650
01:52:06,580 --> 01:52:07,413
but

2651
01:52:09,760 --> 01:52:13,570
they're probably pursuing your goal that's
higher than like covering at home in

2652
01:52:13,571 --> 01:52:18,571
your basement covered the cheeto
dust [inaudible] suspicion for it.

2653
01:52:20,270 --> 01:52:22,360
It's still a sub optimal ethical pursuit.

2654
01:52:22,900 --> 01:52:27,900
[inaudible]

2655
01:52:36,400 --> 01:52:37,520
as you can see,

2656
01:52:37,560 --> 01:52:37,701
this,

2657
01:52:37,701 --> 01:52:39,360
this might work doesn't sound like,

2658
01:52:41,400 --> 01:52:42,071
as you can see,

2659
01:52:42,071 --> 01:52:44,020
I'm President Donald J.

2660
01:52:44,020 --> 01:52:46,400
Trump or as you might not know,

2661
01:52:46,401 --> 01:52:47,780
I'm Trump fake epi.

2662
01:52:48,260 --> 01:52:50,790
So I was born in 1946 older than you.

2663
01:52:51,140 --> 01:52:51,530
So,

2664
01:52:51,530 --> 01:52:52,790
but you might be able to help.

2665
01:52:53,150 --> 01:52:54,020
In my quest,

2666
01:52:54,050 --> 01:52:54,883
in my book,

2667
01:52:54,950 --> 01:52:55,940
the art of the deal,

2668
01:52:56,660 --> 01:53:00,050
I talked about how I'm
not just talking to him,

2669
01:53:00,170 --> 01:53:04,340
I'm trying to bring people
together from where they are.

2670
01:53:04,850 --> 01:53:06,570
It sounds like you've
done that in your packets.

2671
01:53:06,950 --> 01:53:08,190
So here's our big challenge.

2672
01:53:08,270 --> 01:53:09,170
If you could help me with that,

2673
01:53:09,350 --> 01:53:13,910
how are we going to end
the war between the sexes?

2674
01:53:15,130 --> 01:53:19,460
I have an idea how to start off because
you did mention breastfeeding and one of

2675
01:53:19,461 --> 01:53:22,470
your speeches I saw in,

2676
01:53:23,720 --> 01:53:25,940
and right now that's an unpaid labor,

2677
01:53:26,960 --> 01:53:31,960
so [inaudible] paid to breastfeed for a
start I think would be so angry at us,

2678
01:53:41,091 --> 01:53:41,580
man.

2679
01:53:41,580 --> 01:53:46,580
[inaudible]

2680
01:53:55,350 --> 01:53:56,183
to,

2681
01:53:56,550 --> 01:54:00,460
and that's for native to the sexual
harassment question and that's what I've

2682
01:54:00,470 --> 01:54:01,303
seen in question.

2683
01:54:01,320 --> 01:54:02,660
Then it does.

2684
01:54:03,260 --> 01:54:04,580
Looking at all of this,

2685
01:54:04,581 --> 01:54:05,414
which is,

2686
01:54:05,810 --> 01:54:06,021
you know,

2687
01:54:06,021 --> 01:54:10,940
we're trying to pull everyone's
talents into the general marketplace,

2688
01:54:10,970 --> 01:54:14,720
let's say flux and there's
some real utility in mountain.

2689
01:54:14,960 --> 01:54:19,220
It seems stupid to not use
intelligence of half the population.

2690
01:54:19,221 --> 01:54:22,810
And I guess that's kind of what we
decided with the invention of reliable on

2691
01:54:22,820 --> 01:54:23,653
birth control.

2692
01:54:23,750 --> 01:54:27,290
It was sort of a collective decision
that if we could free women from the

2693
01:54:27,291 --> 01:54:32,291
inevitability of nonstop magic maternity,

2694
01:54:33,620 --> 01:54:36,200
that that might be a
net benefit to everyone.

2695
01:54:36,380 --> 01:54:38,600
Now women is true.

2696
01:54:38,601 --> 01:54:41,780
We don't know because the experiments
only me running for 40 years.

2697
01:54:41,781 --> 01:54:42,830
But you might think,

2698
01:54:42,831 --> 01:54:47,831
well it was an experiment with running
and then the sexual revolution on that.

2699
01:54:48,830 --> 01:54:50,270
We're still in the throes of that.

2700
01:54:50,300 --> 01:54:52,260
Is it consequence as far as I'm concerned,

2701
01:54:52,390 --> 01:54:55,120
the introduction of the birth control
pill because that's a biological

2702
01:54:55,130 --> 01:54:55,963
revolution of,

2703
01:54:56,530 --> 01:54:56,741
you know,

2704
01:54:56,741 --> 01:55:00,500
I think the 20th century will
be remembered for hydrogen bomb.

2705
01:55:01,800 --> 01:55:03,800
The microprocessor

2706
01:55:05,300 --> 01:55:08,990
and the birth control for those are the
three big technological revolutions.

2707
01:55:09,870 --> 01:55:10,401
The question is,

2708
01:55:10,401 --> 01:55:10,521
well,

2709
01:55:10,521 --> 01:55:13,670
how should men and women act
towards each other in the workplace?

2710
01:55:13,671 --> 01:55:14,660
And answer that as well.

2711
01:55:14,661 --> 01:55:15,494
We don't,

2712
01:55:16,140 --> 01:55:16,973
no,

2713
01:55:17,250 --> 01:55:18,083
no,

2714
01:55:18,560 --> 01:55:19,393
no,

2715
01:55:19,880 --> 01:55:20,310
no.

2716
01:55:20,310 --> 01:55:23,060
How to regulate our sexual
behavior in the workplace.

2717
01:55:23,550 --> 01:55:24,383
Um,

2718
01:55:24,560 --> 01:55:25,580
I think it has,

2719
01:55:26,960 --> 01:55:27,441
these are,

2720
01:55:27,441 --> 01:55:29,450
these are deeply ethical questions,

2721
01:55:29,810 --> 01:55:32,350
big ethical question of what were you
doing when you go to the nightclub?

2722
01:55:32,351 --> 01:55:32,631
They think,

2723
01:55:32,631 --> 01:55:34,130
well that's not a deep ethical question.

2724
01:55:34,131 --> 01:55:34,401
It's like,

2725
01:55:34,401 --> 01:55:34,821
yeah and it's,

2726
01:55:34,821 --> 01:55:37,930
it's cause they get actually
cause you're asking them,

2727
01:55:37,931 --> 01:55:38,800
well how should I repeat it?

2728
01:55:38,810 --> 01:55:40,870
My sexual behavior when
I have choices matter.

2729
01:55:41,490 --> 01:55:42,950
And it's the same thing in the workplace.

2730
01:55:43,290 --> 01:55:46,470
You miss most in most
situations like this.

2731
01:55:46,471 --> 01:55:51,471
I'm a traditionalist because I actually
think that the best solution to the

2732
01:55:51,961 --> 01:55:56,961
problem about to the multiple problems
that life throws at you is a stable

2733
01:55:58,201 --> 01:55:59,034
monogamy.

2734
01:55:59,310 --> 01:56:00,450
I think the evidence for that,

2735
01:56:00,451 --> 01:56:02,130
it's overwhelming now.

2736
01:56:02,160 --> 01:56:04,050
Exactly how you parameterize that.

2737
01:56:05,020 --> 01:56:08,070
What leeway you allow people
within that framework.

2738
01:56:08,280 --> 01:56:10,430
Well enough wise enough to know.

2739
01:56:11,370 --> 01:56:15,390
I think you deviate from that path at
your peril and that we deviate from that

2740
01:56:15,391 --> 01:56:17,760
path as a society apparel as well.

2741
01:56:18,270 --> 01:56:19,103
And so

2742
01:56:21,390 --> 01:56:25,200
I just would say if you're
looking for a cheap thrill

2743
01:56:26,700 --> 01:56:31,700
and do you think that you could find
that insects that you're sadly mistaken.

2744
01:56:32,850 --> 01:56:34,080
That's what it looks like to me.

2745
01:56:34,770 --> 01:56:39,770
And I think that if people were willing
to accept that idea and I can certainly

2746
01:56:40,201 --> 01:56:42,210
understand why no one wants to

2747
01:56:45,110 --> 01:56:46,190
proceed in the workplace,

2748
01:56:46,191 --> 01:56:51,191
can start to tap themselves down quick
about one of the things I tell my younger

2749
01:56:51,871 --> 01:56:52,920
clients in particular,

2750
01:56:52,921 --> 01:56:56,910
cause you know back in the
1950s I wasn't around him,

2751
01:56:56,911 --> 01:56:59,040
but let's say the 1960s,

2752
01:56:59,540 --> 01:57:00,373
um,

2753
01:57:01,200 --> 01:57:04,350
the default answer to the question,

2754
01:57:04,990 --> 01:57:09,450
will you sleep with animals and
know and that's pretty good default.

2755
01:57:09,750 --> 01:57:12,180
And now it's not so obvious
that that is the deep,

2756
01:57:12,870 --> 01:57:14,160
even though I think it shouldn't be.

2757
01:57:14,580 --> 01:57:15,780
But here's a rule of thumb.

2758
01:57:16,140 --> 01:57:17,280
Is it useful one,

2759
01:57:17,281 --> 01:57:19,230
when you're trying to
figure out how the events,

2760
01:57:19,231 --> 01:57:22,770
your sexual interaction with
frozen new relationship,

2761
01:57:23,310 --> 01:57:26,730
how about you don't do anything physically
with anyone that you wouldn't talk to

2762
01:57:26,731 --> 01:57:28,130
them about it first.

2763
01:57:29,010 --> 01:57:31,050
I don't mean active consent.

2764
01:57:31,530 --> 01:57:36,530
I think that whole idea is a fabrication
of delusional 13 year old girl

2765
01:57:38,310 --> 01:57:43,310
[inaudible] because Mike
is a lot more stuff.

2766
01:57:47,340 --> 01:57:52,340
But I do think that a good rule because
something like no physical intimacy or

2767
01:57:52,950 --> 01:57:54,750
the corresponding emotional intimacy.

2768
01:57:55,110 --> 01:57:57,520
And I think the reason for that is
because you just can't traction.

2769
01:57:58,170 --> 01:58:00,610
If I could come as a package and I,

2770
01:58:00,611 --> 01:58:04,280
I think that you've been
fractionated off your functions,

2771
01:58:04,590 --> 01:58:07,830
let's say at your psychological peril.

2772
01:58:08,730 --> 01:58:09,563
So

2773
01:58:12,480 --> 01:58:13,980
now that's a pretty vague answer,

2774
01:58:14,020 --> 01:58:14,853
unfortunately,

2775
01:58:16,100 --> 01:58:17,430
all encompassing question,

2776
01:58:17,431 --> 01:58:17,641
right?

2777
01:58:17,641 --> 01:58:20,320
So you're going to get a vague answer
to an all encompassing question.

2778
01:58:22,410 --> 01:58:25,680
I also wrote a little bit about that
at the end of the 12 rules for life.

2779
01:58:25,681 --> 01:58:27,110
When I'm talking about the architect,

2780
01:58:28,250 --> 01:58:29,850
the architectural know,

2781
01:58:30,270 --> 01:58:34,410
the architectural representations of
human beings in the Christian domain,

2782
01:58:34,770 --> 01:58:39,180
the archetypal representation of a woman
is a virgin with the chocolate and the

2783
01:58:39,190 --> 01:58:40,800
archetypal representation of a man.

2784
01:58:40,801 --> 01:58:42,070
It's a crucified heal.

2785
01:58:42,880 --> 01:58:44,960
And those are all some
pretty decent representation.

2786
01:58:45,150 --> 01:58:46,120
They're overwhelming,

2787
01:58:46,210 --> 01:58:46,930
powerful,

2788
01:58:46,930 --> 01:58:50,740
you know that because they wouldn't
last several thousand years.

2789
01:58:50,750 --> 01:58:51,500
The code heavy wonder,

2790
01:58:51,500 --> 01:58:56,500
well how well globally the crucifixion
image is an image of the voluntary except

2791
01:58:57,851 --> 01:59:01,420
as the suffering and death and the
possibility that's transcendent and the

2792
01:59:01,421 --> 01:59:03,450
virgin mother is something like that.

2793
01:59:04,060 --> 01:59:09,060
The pristine totality of the feminine
and the and the and the feminine in

2794
01:59:10,421 --> 01:59:11,590
conjunction with the infant.

2795
01:59:11,980 --> 01:59:13,330
And those are holding images.

2796
01:59:13,331 --> 01:59:17,050
And then I would say that if you're
not treating each other like you're a

2797
01:59:17,051 --> 01:59:19,150
manifestation of that whole the image,

2798
01:59:19,151 --> 01:59:21,910
then you're not treating each
other property might say,

2799
01:59:21,911 --> 01:59:22,900
well that's a pretty high,

2800
01:59:23,940 --> 01:59:24,773
you know,

2801
01:59:27,260 --> 01:59:29,760
that's an extreme demands.

2802
01:59:29,770 --> 01:59:30,700
Like well that's okay.

2803
01:59:30,790 --> 01:59:31,850
Life makes experience.

2804
01:59:32,650 --> 01:59:34,410
There's nothing about 20 extremes of

2805
01:59:36,190 --> 01:59:40,540
the reason that those are images exist
is because they reflect a reality that

2806
01:59:40,541 --> 01:59:41,680
can't be transcendent,

2807
01:59:42,130 --> 01:59:43,000
something like that.

2808
01:59:43,001 --> 01:59:45,070
And so you violate them at your peril.

2809
01:59:46,810 --> 01:59:47,643
So

2810
01:59:49,780 --> 01:59:51,060
it's a little rough that

2811
01:59:52,660 --> 01:59:53,493
have to do,

2812
01:59:55,380 --> 01:59:56,320
here's some big band.

2813
01:59:57,250 --> 01:59:59,580
I am doing research on plasticity.

2814
02:00:00,880 --> 02:00:02,290
I read normally

2815
02:00:04,240 --> 02:00:09,240
if you're forward vocals and I
was just wondering why your costs,

2816
02:00:10,600 --> 02:00:13,030
the CV search as it got
me the streaming engine,

2817
02:00:13,050 --> 02:00:14,920
that sense of

2818
02:00:16,910 --> 02:00:18,800
psychologists boxes.

2819
02:00:20,810 --> 02:00:21,643
Um,

2820
02:00:22,060 --> 02:00:27,060
well I think that it is talked about but
I would say it's talked about more on

2821
02:00:27,071 --> 02:00:28,650
the biological end of the spectrum,

2822
02:00:28,660 --> 02:00:30,870
like convinced studies of neuroplasticity,

2823
02:00:30,940 --> 02:00:31,620
especially at the,

2824
02:00:31,620 --> 02:00:33,820
the capital level for a
very long period of time.

2825
02:00:34,270 --> 02:00:38,080
But then I would also say probably because
it's more of a medical concern that

2826
02:00:38,081 --> 02:00:39,990
it is a psychology concerns specifically.

2827
02:00:40,900 --> 02:00:42,500
So that was about,

2828
02:00:44,200 --> 02:00:45,920
it's also very complicated field,

2829
02:00:48,750 --> 02:00:51,850
but it's more psychologists.

2830
02:00:52,990 --> 02:00:54,580
Unless you go to a clinical school,

2831
02:00:54,970 --> 02:00:58,300
most of the psychology you take is
direct from the experimental realm.

2832
02:00:58,420 --> 02:01:01,180
So it's not concerned with medical
issues to such a great degree.

2833
02:01:02,710 --> 02:01:04,420
There is plenty of study done on,

2834
02:01:04,770 --> 02:01:08,950
on neuro transformations that
occur as a consequence of learning.

2835
02:01:09,470 --> 02:01:10,150
So,

2836
02:01:10,150 --> 02:01:15,150
but not so much with regards to neural
plasticity as a treatment that just or

2837
02:01:15,640 --> 02:01:17,890
exploitation of
neuroplasticity as a treatment,

2838
02:01:17,891 --> 02:01:20,040
which is what Norman was concentrating on.

2839
02:01:20,890 --> 02:01:24,730
So I think it is more at a
micro level among psychologist,

2840
02:01:24,731 --> 02:01:25,321
but it's very,

2841
02:01:25,321 --> 02:01:29,830
you just have to look into more of the
physiological end of the literature

2842
02:01:29,860 --> 02:01:32,220
rather than straight forward.

2843
02:01:32,260 --> 02:01:33,093
Second logical,

2844
02:01:39,440 --> 02:01:40,880
this isn't much of a question.

2845
02:01:41,030 --> 02:01:41,863
More of a thank you.

2846
02:01:41,950 --> 02:01:42,230
Uh,

2847
02:01:42,230 --> 02:01:46,380
two weeks ago I wouldn't be able changing
when I walked in the Nasdaq and 25 to

2848
02:01:46,381 --> 02:01:47,070
your diverse,

2849
02:01:47,070 --> 02:01:50,440
we're sitting around and watching the
electric line equity base politics and

2850
02:01:50,730 --> 02:01:52,100
what we're facing right now.

2851
02:01:52,350 --> 02:01:53,390
Um,

2852
02:01:54,710 --> 02:01:56,390
and additionally,

2853
02:01:57,530 --> 02:01:58,820
first by from unit,

2854
02:01:59,000 --> 02:01:59,540
um,

2855
02:01:59,540 --> 02:02:04,540
your explanation archetypes and most
amount of stress disorder for a number of

2856
02:02:04,640 --> 02:02:05,210
people.

2857
02:02:05,210 --> 02:02:06,043
You're not from.

2858
02:02:06,690 --> 02:02:08,070
I just like the Pantry for that.

2859
02:02:08,180 --> 02:02:10,250
If then you a small token to clarify.

2860
02:02:11,670 --> 02:02:12,210
Thank you.

2861
02:02:12,210 --> 02:02:17,210
[inaudible]

2862
02:02:28,810 --> 02:02:31,440
I want to make a comment about that
because one of the things that's happened

2863
02:02:31,500 --> 02:02:32,430
very frequently

2864
02:02:34,110 --> 02:02:36,390
over the last 18 months or so has been,

2865
02:02:36,480 --> 02:02:37,410
I've had letters

2866
02:02:39,330 --> 02:02:44,330
members come up to me during my talks
and said that they'd be suffering from

2867
02:02:44,971 --> 02:02:49,971
post traumatic stress disorder and
listening to my lectures on health and you

2868
02:02:52,460 --> 02:02:52,621
know,

2869
02:02:52,621 --> 02:02:53,570
what's the right thing here?

2870
02:02:53,610 --> 02:02:55,140
Because supposed to be
an express disorders.

2871
02:02:55,500 --> 02:02:56,333
That's

2872
02:02:59,040 --> 02:03:01,860
horrible condition and you know,

2873
02:03:01,920 --> 02:03:06,720
it's so interesting because I treated
a number of people stress disorder who

2874
02:03:06,721 --> 02:03:08,790
aren't military people
can find where it doesn't.

2875
02:03:08,910 --> 02:03:12,600
It doesn't really matter in some
sense of what I had gathered from now.

2876
02:03:12,640 --> 02:03:12,970
This is,

2877
02:03:12,970 --> 02:03:16,350
but from reading you on as
well was that people need to,

2878
02:03:16,740 --> 02:03:19,290
if something terrible has happened to you,

2879
02:03:19,920 --> 02:03:21,240
it's more than just trap.

2880
02:03:21,510 --> 02:03:22,201
That's on Fab,

2881
02:03:22,201 --> 02:03:23,530
not crunching travel fees,

2882
02:03:23,531 --> 02:03:25,620
backtrack traffic weeks when
your mother dies of cancer.

2883
02:03:25,621 --> 02:03:26,550
That's a terrible thing.

2884
02:03:28,740 --> 02:03:33,740
Malevolence is when someone destroys
your life on purpose or destroy someone

2885
02:03:33,961 --> 02:03:34,571
else's life.

2886
02:03:34,571 --> 02:03:39,460
That brings pain movies necessarily with
all sorts of circumstances where the

2887
02:03:39,530 --> 02:03:44,490
spring forward not really hurts people
and if you have post traumatic stress

2888
02:03:44,491 --> 02:03:45,030
disorder,

2889
02:03:45,030 --> 02:03:46,020
as far as I can tell,

2890
02:03:46,021 --> 02:03:48,750
the only thing that can bring you back,

2891
02:03:48,790 --> 02:03:53,430
it's to develop a religious level
philosophy of avid between good and evil.

2892
02:03:54,120 --> 02:03:58,260
I've seen anything I've ever seen because
first of all if you listen to someone

2893
02:03:58,261 --> 02:03:59,880
who have post traumatic stress disorder,

2894
02:04:00,210 --> 02:04:01,120
I gotta I declined.

2895
02:04:01,400 --> 02:04:05,010
I talk about her a little bit in this
book though I tried to disguise your

2896
02:04:05,011 --> 02:04:10,011
identity who was frightened into
three years of four hour long Gayley

2897
02:04:10,331 --> 02:04:12,910
concussions by will
invoke on her boyfriends.

2898
02:04:14,280 --> 02:04:15,360
That actually happened now.

2899
02:04:15,361 --> 02:04:20,361
She was a very naive person who thanks
to the parents and she saw a look that

2900
02:04:21,781 --> 02:04:22,110
man,

2901
02:04:22,110 --> 02:04:24,850
I am going to do everything
I possibly can to her.

2902
02:04:25,650 --> 02:04:30,360
And she didn't believe that such a low
awesome being very naive and that was

2903
02:04:30,361 --> 02:04:31,194
enough to,

2904
02:04:32,790 --> 02:04:33,300
well,

2905
02:04:33,300 --> 02:04:36,810
when she first came to be the
last diagnosis she had with,

2906
02:04:38,230 --> 02:04:43,230
that's what all about you fragment and
we worked through that in about a year,

2907
02:04:44,120 --> 02:04:47,850
about a year and she was a lot
less naive by the end of that year.

2908
02:04:47,980 --> 02:04:48,813
I'm telling you,

2909
02:04:49,060 --> 02:04:49,893
but,

2910
02:04:51,310 --> 02:04:52,290
but that was,

2911
02:04:52,590 --> 02:04:54,300
that's been so striking to me because

2912
02:04:56,910 --> 02:04:57,181
you know,

2913
02:04:57,181 --> 02:05:00,120
when you're treating someone with a
very serious psychiatric condition,

2914
02:05:01,620 --> 02:05:04,710
they'd be exposed to
something brutally terrible.

2915
02:05:06,470 --> 02:05:10,890
That there's a philosophical cure for
that or get a theological pure in some

2916
02:05:10,891 --> 02:05:12,540
sense of whatever.

2917
02:05:13,100 --> 02:05:14,010
It's really remarkable.

2918
02:05:14,070 --> 02:05:15,180
That can be the case.

2919
02:05:15,870 --> 02:05:20,460
But just for people to know that that
evil does exist in the world is a great

2920
02:05:20,461 --> 02:05:24,090
relief in front of buy it and
have no language to describe it.

2921
02:05:24,660 --> 02:05:24,941
Yeah,

2922
02:05:24,941 --> 02:05:29,250
I believe people exist exists
and you this and you real.

2923
02:05:29,550 --> 02:05:30,750
It's really real.

2924
02:05:30,960 --> 02:05:32,490
It's more real than anything else.

2925
02:05:32,730 --> 02:05:35,490
Almost except maybe then good.

2926
02:05:36,180 --> 02:05:37,950
And it's a relief to people to know that,

2927
02:05:38,850 --> 02:05:42,030
to know that that's actually the case
because then it takes them out with their

2928
02:05:42,031 --> 02:05:43,020
terrible isolation.

2929
02:05:44,070 --> 02:05:46,890
What's the vacuum and the
common realm of humanity,

2930
02:05:47,720 --> 02:05:47,881
you know?

2931
02:05:47,881 --> 02:05:48,631
And also to say,

2932
02:05:48,631 --> 02:05:52,980
well Tony does evil exist but it
exists in you and in each of us.

2933
02:05:53,040 --> 02:05:57,750
And the mere fact that it manifested
itself does not necessarily mean that

2934
02:05:57,751 --> 02:05:59,370
you're damned for all time,

2935
02:05:59,610 --> 02:06:01,890
which is really how you feel if
you have post traumatic stress.

2936
02:06:04,100 --> 02:06:08,080
So that's been extremely
interested in him and also great.

2937
02:06:08,190 --> 02:06:12,930
It's wonderful thing to have people
being hurt so badly and we can't find any

2938
02:06:13,230 --> 02:06:14,063
respite.

2939
02:06:14,280 --> 02:06:14,850
How would you say?

2940
02:06:14,850 --> 02:06:18,870
Well I listen to lectures
about versus tragic,

2941
02:06:19,560 --> 02:06:24,540
which are key lecture problem that
it's to help put you back together.

2942
02:06:24,930 --> 02:06:26,970
So that's good news man.

2943
02:06:27,750 --> 02:06:28,583
Thank you very much.

2944
02:06:29,470 --> 02:06:30,660
All right,

2945
02:06:32,760 --> 02:06:36,590
thank you for joining us again in May
cover and I just want to thank you.

2946
02:06:38,810 --> 02:06:39,730
I'll get to my question.

2947
02:06:40,580 --> 02:06:45,090
You had an interview recently with a
place to place news and there was like

2948
02:06:52,610 --> 02:06:57,610
[inaudible] [inaudible] the sort of
reaction that people haven't seen this,

2949
02:06:59,791 --> 02:07:04,791
but the reaction to the people who did
get or sort of some combination of anger

2950
02:07:05,071 --> 02:07:07,890
and confusion at that little
excerpt that they were meeting.

2951
02:07:08,180 --> 02:07:08,820
Um,

2952
02:07:08,820 --> 02:07:13,350
and you were talking about what sort of
rules like Hubbard men and women working

2953
02:07:13,351 --> 02:07:15,740
together in the workplace and
the number of related division.

2954
02:07:15,960 --> 02:07:18,480
Cause I wanted to ask
you about that interview,

2955
02:07:18,710 --> 02:07:18,870
uh,

2956
02:07:18,870 --> 02:07:20,220
what happened in that interview,

2957
02:07:20,221 --> 02:07:24,030
in what happened in that exchange
and maybe give some context to,

2958
02:07:24,380 --> 02:07:25,080
you know,

2959
02:07:25,080 --> 02:07:27,130
what was going on in that
particular exchange that,

2960
02:07:28,350 --> 02:07:28,670
well,

2961
02:07:28,670 --> 02:07:32,820
I think what happened in the interview
is what's happening as the traditional

2962
02:07:32,850 --> 02:07:33,850
media folds,

2963
02:07:33,880 --> 02:07:35,220
boobies and parish,

2964
02:07:35,740 --> 02:07:39,310
which is happening to the
extraordinary community newspapers.

2965
02:07:39,311 --> 02:07:42,610
And you go on cabinet
government for their subsequent,

2966
02:07:42,611 --> 02:07:42,851
you know,

2967
02:07:42,851 --> 02:07:46,120
that CDC and 145,000 youtube subscribers.

2968
02:07:46,540 --> 02:07:48,690
I don't remember what their budget is,

2969
02:07:48,691 --> 02:07:49,360
but it's,

2970
02:07:49,360 --> 02:07:50,193
it's in there,

2971
02:07:50,500 --> 02:07:51,760
if I remember correctly,

2972
02:07:51,761 --> 02:07:52,750
it's $1 billion,

2973
02:07:52,751 --> 02:07:53,890
but that might be wrong,

2974
02:07:54,040 --> 02:07:54,873
but it doesn't matter.

2975
02:07:55,110 --> 02:07:56,110
It's a lot.

2976
02:07:56,350 --> 02:08:00,400
And all the finish degenerate on
youtube does under 45,000 subscribers.

2977
02:08:00,401 --> 02:08:00,700
It's like,

2978
02:08:00,700 --> 02:08:05,500
which is absolute abject
100% catastrophic failures.

2979
02:08:07,750 --> 02:08:09,580
I think that there's a
bunch of reasons for that.

2980
02:08:09,610 --> 02:08:12,850
I mean one of them is that there is a
technological transformation of current,

2981
02:08:13,390 --> 02:08:13,631
right?

2982
02:08:13,631 --> 02:08:18,631
Because one of the things about youtube
offers everything that TV offers and a

2983
02:08:18,941 --> 02:08:20,200
bunch of things it doesn't offer,

2984
02:08:20,320 --> 02:08:21,430
so it's going to win.

2985
02:08:21,880 --> 02:08:24,460
It's clearly winning already and so,

2986
02:08:25,080 --> 02:08:28,930
and then I think that what's happening
as the classic broadcast media starts to

2987
02:08:28,931 --> 02:08:30,160
spiral has been good.

2988
02:08:30,161 --> 02:08:31,090
People start to leave.

2989
02:08:31,091 --> 02:08:32,470
It's a premium distribution issue.

2990
02:08:32,710 --> 02:08:36,790
They're good people start to leave because
they can and then those that remain

2991
02:08:36,791 --> 02:08:41,530
are less competent and they get more
desperate and they broadcast more and more

2992
02:08:41,531 --> 02:08:46,531
opinionated and Polaroids pieces to
attract the remaining audience as they

2993
02:08:47,351 --> 02:08:49,330
spiral towards zero

2994
02:08:51,490 --> 02:08:54,790
is how companies like I know how it works.

2995
02:08:55,330 --> 02:08:56,200
That's how it works.

2996
02:08:56,201 --> 02:09:00,620
And so I think the vice interview
as part of that and the injured,

2997
02:09:00,680 --> 02:09:00,990
there's,

2998
02:09:00,990 --> 02:09:02,680
there's other things that
are feeding into that.

2999
02:09:02,680 --> 02:09:03,513
But I think,

3000
02:09:03,850 --> 02:09:06,740
and maybe this is also a
consequence of the broadcast medium,

3001
02:09:06,760 --> 02:09:11,170
is that because broadcast
television had a very narrow time,

3002
02:09:11,500 --> 02:09:12,790
heavy crown contracts,

3003
02:09:12,791 --> 02:09:14,830
things in the small periods of time too.

3004
02:09:14,831 --> 02:09:19,831
It was very pronounced
tendency for journalists to
do all the interpretation and

3005
02:09:20,081 --> 02:09:23,770
then that turned into a pronounced
tendency for journalists to describe what

3006
02:09:23,771 --> 02:09:25,750
they thought and what the news was.

3007
02:09:26,020 --> 02:09:26,261
Right,

3008
02:09:26,261 --> 02:09:29,430
so that they were now
the the news rubbers,

3009
02:09:29,640 --> 02:09:31,980
I started noticing this
about 25 years ago with,

3010
02:09:32,390 --> 02:09:33,190
you know,

3011
02:09:33,190 --> 02:09:35,290
the news would show a politician talking,

3012
02:09:36,460 --> 02:09:39,300
but the newscaster would be
saying what the person said.

3013
02:09:39,310 --> 02:09:40,143
It's like,

3014
02:09:40,480 --> 02:09:40,661
well,

3015
02:09:40,661 --> 02:09:44,800
why have the volume missionary
at all humans have the newscast?

3016
02:09:45,370 --> 02:09:49,630
And that's when I stopped
watching television news and
that was reading about 25

3017
02:09:49,631 --> 02:09:50,464
years ago.

3018
02:09:50,600 --> 02:09:52,030
The vice interview was,

3019
02:09:52,270 --> 02:09:54,220
was that sort of taken to its extreme?

3020
02:09:54,270 --> 02:09:55,810
It's like he had enough,

3021
02:09:56,530 --> 02:10:01,300
he had an idea of what the
situation was and he was doing,

3022
02:10:01,780 --> 02:10:04,800
he wasn't as aggressive
about it as Kathy Newman.

3023
02:10:06,410 --> 02:10:08,350
It was the same sort of thing.

3024
02:10:08,390 --> 02:10:13,260
It's like he was not cashed me out one
way or another and not have it for about

3025
02:10:13,261 --> 02:10:13,751
two hours.

3026
02:10:13,751 --> 02:10:16,340
And he had kind of a
supercilious attitude,

3027
02:10:16,980 --> 02:10:17,770
um,

3028
02:10:17,770 --> 02:10:21,750
which is not uncommon among let's say
New York journalists and you don't,

3029
02:10:22,090 --> 02:10:27,090
and we talked for about two hours and
I said something that was provocative.

3030
02:10:28,511 --> 02:10:31,240
I would say that I said,

3031
02:10:31,241 --> 02:10:31,391
well,

3032
02:10:31,391 --> 02:10:34,460
we don't know what the rules
governing men and women's behavior,

3033
02:10:34,520 --> 02:10:36,800
sexual behavior in the
workplace should be.

3034
02:10:36,801 --> 02:10:37,071
I said,

3035
02:10:37,071 --> 02:10:37,221
well,

3036
02:10:37,221 --> 02:10:39,410
let's take makeup high heels for examples.

3037
02:10:39,411 --> 02:10:41,270
Like maybe they shouldn't be allowed.

3038
02:10:41,690 --> 02:10:44,000
I didn't say they shouldn't be allowed.

3039
02:10:44,870 --> 02:10:45,200
I said,

3040
02:10:45,200 --> 02:10:46,330
maybe they shouldn't be allowed.

3041
02:10:46,580 --> 02:10:49,350
That was actually what you do when
you try to think about something.

3042
02:10:49,490 --> 02:10:54,490
[inaudible]

3043
02:10:55,130 --> 02:10:56,090
my clinical practice.

3044
02:10:56,100 --> 02:10:59,150
So let's say I'm dealing
with someone and I say,

3045
02:10:59,151 --> 02:10:59,271
well,

3046
02:10:59,271 --> 02:11:03,020
let's think of some options for
your future and for their reading.

3047
02:11:03,021 --> 02:11:04,370
Nervous like right away it's like,

3048
02:11:04,371 --> 02:11:04,581
no,

3049
02:11:04,581 --> 02:11:05,480
I don't want to do that.

3050
02:11:05,510 --> 02:11:05,800
It's like,

3051
02:11:05,800 --> 02:11:06,890
well relax.

3052
02:11:07,670 --> 02:11:09,440
We can talk about a bunch of things.

3053
02:11:09,670 --> 02:11:14,670
And that doesn't mean they
have to have these life is like

3054
02:11:17,390 --> 02:11:20,270
for people to make out
when you get all nervous.

3055
02:11:20,271 --> 02:11:20,561
And he said,

3056
02:11:20,561 --> 02:11:22,580
well I'd want to talk about with that.

3057
02:11:23,000 --> 02:11:25,280
We're not really make a rule.

3058
02:11:25,370 --> 02:11:27,050
We're going to talk
about 10 things to make.

3059
02:11:27,051 --> 02:11:29,190
It might happen and none
of them are going to help.

3060
02:11:30,570 --> 02:11:32,240
People can finally have a bit of courage.

3061
02:11:32,241 --> 02:11:36,620
And maybe what we'll do when you think
is you throw out an idea and you think

3062
02:11:36,621 --> 02:11:37,460
about going to talk.

3063
02:11:37,461 --> 02:11:40,250
Well you know it's been common practice.

3064
02:11:40,280 --> 02:11:41,930
Men wear uniforms at work,

3065
02:11:43,080 --> 02:11:43,970
wear suits,

3066
02:11:44,220 --> 02:11:46,340
the suits a derivation
of a military uniform.

3067
02:11:46,670 --> 02:11:48,020
Why did men wear suits?

3068
02:11:48,290 --> 02:11:50,450
So they're all the same.

3069
02:11:50,930 --> 02:11:52,490
Why should they all be all the same?

3070
02:11:52,790 --> 02:11:57,790
So that unnecessary individual
variability doesn't interfere with the

3071
02:11:57,981 --> 02:11:59,810
functionality of the business.

3072
02:11:59,930 --> 02:12:01,190
Now you can argue about that.

3073
02:12:01,191 --> 02:12:01,641
You might say,

3074
02:12:01,641 --> 02:12:05,380
well he didn't want to make everyone
wear the same damn soon cause you get

3075
02:12:05,470 --> 02:12:07,790
involved with creativity and fair enough,

3076
02:12:07,791 --> 02:12:08,840
that's a reasonable argument.

3077
02:12:08,841 --> 02:12:10,820
But that's why the uniform,

3078
02:12:10,821 --> 02:12:11,990
the suit evolve.

3079
02:12:12,230 --> 02:12:15,530
And so if you wear a suit and I wear a
suit and go to a business meeting and the

3080
02:12:15,531 --> 02:12:17,150
first thing we can figure out as well,

3081
02:12:17,270 --> 02:12:19,460
you're at least playing the same game.

3082
02:12:19,461 --> 02:12:20,390
I am enough.

3083
02:12:20,391 --> 02:12:24,080
So that you're wearing a suit and
it's like that's not everything,

3084
02:12:24,081 --> 02:12:25,190
but it's not nothing.

3085
02:12:25,400 --> 02:12:26,090
Right.

3086
02:12:26,090 --> 02:12:26,923
And so well,

3087
02:12:26,990 --> 02:12:28,300
and then when the mine was,

3088
02:12:28,400 --> 02:12:28,671
you know,

3089
02:12:28,671 --> 02:12:31,370
with the mouth made
their advances in China,

3090
02:12:32,090 --> 02:12:34,010
men and women wore the same uniform.

3091
02:12:34,150 --> 02:12:34,983
Why?

3092
02:12:35,050 --> 02:12:35,171
Oh,

3093
02:12:35,171 --> 02:12:36,240
it was for the same reason.

3094
02:12:36,241 --> 02:12:39,200
That was to eliminate unnecessary
individual variability.

3095
02:12:39,650 --> 02:12:40,460
Well,

3096
02:12:40,460 --> 02:12:42,530
if you don't want sexual behavior at work,

3097
02:12:43,280 --> 02:12:43,701
first of all,

3098
02:12:43,701 --> 02:12:44,610
you've got to decide that.

3099
02:12:44,960 --> 02:12:47,780
Do you not want sexual behavior at work?

3100
02:12:47,990 --> 02:12:49,850
Cause the answer to that might not be,

3101
02:12:50,060 --> 02:12:52,070
we don't want sexual behavior at work.

3102
02:12:52,310 --> 02:12:52,891
Do you want to live?

3103
02:12:52,891 --> 02:12:55,940
If you want to work in an environment
where romantic entanglements are

3104
02:12:56,000 --> 02:12:56,990
essentially illegal,

3105
02:12:57,680 --> 02:12:59,030
that's what NBC has done,

3106
02:12:59,660 --> 02:12:59,991
right?

3107
02:12:59,991 --> 02:13:02,420
That's their new policy is like if there,

3108
02:13:02,480 --> 02:13:04,520
if you work at NBC and you know,

3109
02:13:04,521 --> 02:13:08,870
have coworkers who are having a romantic
engagement with another coworker,

3110
02:13:08,990 --> 02:13:11,330
you're obligated to report them to HR.

3111
02:13:11,840 --> 02:13:12,500
It's like,

3112
02:13:12,500 --> 02:13:14,450
well you might say no affairs at work.

3113
02:13:14,520 --> 02:13:15,353
Like okay,

3114
02:13:15,650 --> 02:13:18,440
you want to put an informer
culture in place to impose that,

3115
02:13:18,441 --> 02:13:19,274
do you?

3116
02:13:19,460 --> 02:13:19,611
Well,

3117
02:13:19,611 --> 02:13:20,444
maybe you do,

3118
02:13:21,140 --> 02:13:25,070
but maybe you should think about it
because the cure might be worse than the

3119
02:13:25,071 --> 02:13:25,904
disease.

3120
02:13:26,030 --> 02:13:26,361
It's like,

3121
02:13:26,361 --> 02:13:27,194
well,

3122
02:13:27,260 --> 02:13:31,260
like the evolutionary psychology
and biology of makeup at ideal,

3123
02:13:31,261 --> 02:13:32,490
if it's crystal clear,

3124
02:13:32,660 --> 02:13:34,200
you people dispute it that it's like,

3125
02:13:34,201 --> 02:13:39,201
well read the God damn literature more
on [inaudible] get so sick of this.

3126
02:13:39,781 --> 02:13:42,630
It's like these aren't opinions
that I'm just trying out.

3127
02:13:43,410 --> 02:13:43,950
You know,

3128
02:13:43,950 --> 02:13:45,300
why don't women were rude.

3129
02:13:45,350 --> 02:13:47,130
It's to make the cheeks look like fruit.

3130
02:13:47,310 --> 02:13:49,650
That's why were derived from fruit,

3131
02:13:50,220 --> 02:13:50,641
fruit,

3132
02:13:50,641 --> 02:13:51,600
eating primates.

3133
02:13:51,601 --> 02:13:52,470
We have color vision.

3134
02:13:52,471 --> 02:13:53,370
It's tricor man.

3135
02:13:53,700 --> 02:13:54,750
We pick out fruits,

3136
02:13:54,751 --> 02:13:55,200
right?

3137
02:13:55,200 --> 02:13:56,640
It's of the lipstick does.

3138
02:13:56,670 --> 02:13:59,080
It also indicates a sexual flush.

3139
02:13:59,430 --> 02:14:00,241
If you don't like that,

3140
02:14:00,241 --> 02:14:01,410
well tough luck for you.

3141
02:14:01,570 --> 02:14:02,390
That's what it is.

3142
02:14:02,390 --> 02:14:05,240
[inaudible]

3143
02:14:05,870 --> 02:14:06,121
and again,

3144
02:14:06,121 --> 02:14:07,800
in case you and the
swell and youthful glow,

3145
02:14:07,801 --> 02:14:09,870
but that's also associated
with sexual attraction.

3146
02:14:09,871 --> 02:14:12,930
Just cause that was one of the prime
determinants of sexual attractiveness for

3147
02:14:12,931 --> 02:14:13,920
women among men.

3148
02:14:14,640 --> 02:14:18,060
So now I'm not saying that
that shouldn't happen at work.

3149
02:14:18,061 --> 02:14:18,900
And then high heels.

3150
02:14:18,901 --> 02:14:19,111
Okay.

3151
02:14:19,111 --> 02:14:20,220
Why do you wear high heels?

3152
02:14:20,570 --> 02:14:20,740
Well,

3153
02:14:20,740 --> 02:14:21,810
it's because it's accepted.

3154
02:14:21,840 --> 02:14:26,840
It tilts your hips so that your
[inaudible] is that acceptable at work?

3155
02:14:36,010 --> 02:14:36,843
It's like,

3156
02:14:37,080 --> 02:14:37,321
no,

3157
02:14:37,321 --> 02:14:38,460
not of course,

3158
02:14:39,000 --> 02:14:39,340
no one,

3159
02:14:39,340 --> 02:14:41,610
of course perhaps,

3160
02:14:42,240 --> 02:14:45,600
but we can't have a serious discussion
on what's acceptable work and what isn't

3161
02:14:45,601 --> 02:14:47,640
because we're to Gambia
mature to have the discussion.

3162
02:14:47,641 --> 02:14:50,250
You get to the throw things
over the table like that.

3163
02:14:50,550 --> 02:14:53,390
It's like I don't know what the
rules should be at my workplace,

3164
02:14:53,430 --> 02:14:54,091
at the university,

3165
02:14:54,091 --> 02:14:59,091
I have been worn in numerable times not
to have a discussion with the student,

3166
02:14:59,250 --> 02:15:00,061
male or female,

3167
02:15:00,061 --> 02:15:04,320
but it's the females that
are off concerning this
particular room with the door

3168
02:15:04,321 --> 02:15:06,210
shut and that's it.

3169
02:15:06,210 --> 02:15:07,620
That's not like six months ago.

3170
02:15:07,621 --> 02:15:08,454
That's not like a free,

3171
02:15:09,080 --> 02:15:11,430
that's like advice from the last 50 years.

3172
02:15:11,580 --> 02:15:13,260
I don't listen to that because I think,

3173
02:15:13,440 --> 02:15:14,100
sorry,

3174
02:15:14,100 --> 02:15:15,360
I'm not living that way,

3175
02:15:16,020 --> 02:15:18,690
but these things are tense.

3176
02:15:18,750 --> 02:15:22,860
They're tense and we won't talk
about them intelligently and mature.

3177
02:15:23,310 --> 02:15:23,521
You know?

3178
02:15:23,521 --> 02:15:28,521
I've also been accused three times
in my career of sexual impropriety,

3179
02:15:29,040 --> 02:15:30,600
baseless accusations,

3180
02:15:30,840 --> 02:15:34,380
and the last one really
tangled me up for a whole year.

3181
02:15:34,650 --> 02:15:36,900
It's not entertaining,

3182
02:15:37,650 --> 02:15:39,540
so there's plenty to be sorted out.

3183
02:15:39,541 --> 02:15:41,910
But like I said already,

3184
02:15:42,120 --> 02:15:45,240
we live in the delusion of a
13 year old adolescent girl.

3185
02:15:46,610 --> 02:15:49,350
Maintain that level of sophistication.

3186
02:15:49,580 --> 02:15:52,770
We're not to have a real conversation
about what rules should govern men and

3187
02:15:52,771 --> 02:15:53,820
women in the workplace.

3188
02:15:54,330 --> 02:15:58,490
So you can't even open the damn
discussion of the jumped on like,

3189
02:15:58,700 --> 02:15:59,420
you know,

3190
02:15:59,420 --> 02:16:04,420
a ray of like rather than
heartbeat [inaudible] boots.

3191
02:16:06,401 --> 02:16:09,930
Like it's no bloody wonder the media is
dying if you're doing everything they

3192
02:16:09,931 --> 02:16:14,931
possibly can to cut their throats and
bleed out as fast [inaudible] performance

3193
02:16:16,800 --> 02:16:17,760
on device devices.

3194
02:16:18,240 --> 02:16:23,240
Some of them are irritated at me about
the makeup and ideal thing is I knew

3195
02:16:23,641 --> 02:16:25,060
perfectly well when I said that.

3196
02:16:25,061 --> 02:16:25,351
I thought,

3197
02:16:25,351 --> 02:16:26,090
Oh yeah,

3198
02:16:26,090 --> 02:16:29,150
I'll say this and it's the
only Goddamn [inaudible].

3199
02:16:31,200 --> 02:16:32,033
Um,

3200
02:16:34,000 --> 02:16:37,600
but most of the comments that
I've written so far have been,

3201
02:16:37,900 --> 02:16:38,261
look,

3202
02:16:38,261 --> 02:16:38,951
vice guys,

3203
02:16:38,951 --> 02:16:40,840
we know what you're up to
him pretty much sick of it.

3204
02:16:41,290 --> 02:16:43,060
And I know that people like Ben Shapiro's,

3205
02:16:43,090 --> 02:16:45,430
he won't repair it now
cause it doesn't lie.

3206
02:16:46,180 --> 02:16:48,170
And that's how it pretty
damn reason next day.

3207
02:16:48,220 --> 02:16:49,053
I was sure.

3208
02:16:49,060 --> 02:16:52,210
One of the things that really shocked
me about channel four in Britain.

3209
02:16:52,360 --> 02:16:53,590
That was the Catholic Newman thing.

3210
02:16:53,920 --> 02:16:58,870
So I walked into that after I had a busy
morning doing some other things at the

3211
02:16:58,871 --> 02:16:59,704
studio there.

3212
02:16:59,800 --> 02:17:00,631
I want to get to that.

3213
02:17:00,631 --> 02:17:05,530
And we met Kathy in the green room and
she was getting all steamed and crimped

3214
02:17:05,531 --> 02:17:10,531
up and [inaudible] well,

3215
02:17:28,990 --> 02:17:30,220
it's funny when you're on those,

3216
02:17:30,370 --> 02:17:31,210
those new shows,

3217
02:17:31,360 --> 02:17:34,930
because there's always a cloud with
people around the hosts and fixing up the

3218
02:17:34,931 --> 02:17:37,330
name nup it's like they're
surrounded by bees,

3219
02:17:39,820 --> 02:17:41,380
so it's quite comical for wash.

3220
02:17:41,680 --> 02:17:42,700
And so anyways,

3221
02:17:42,701 --> 02:17:44,510
we went out in front of
the cameras were happening,

3222
02:17:44,580 --> 02:17:46,030
perfectly friendly and discussion.

3223
02:17:46,300 --> 02:17:46,600
Um,

3224
02:17:46,600 --> 02:17:50,800
she was all chipper and extroverted
and having to find time.

3225
02:17:51,580 --> 02:17:54,810
Then he sat down and we chatted for two
minutes and then the cameras went from,

3226
02:17:54,820 --> 02:17:56,410
it was like different person.

3227
02:17:57,150 --> 02:17:57,820
Oh,

3228
02:17:57,820 --> 02:17:58,653
I see.

3229
02:17:58,870 --> 02:18:00,070
I see what's going on here.

3230
02:18:00,540 --> 02:18:01,020
So,

3231
02:18:01,020 --> 02:18:02,830
but it's this,

3232
02:18:02,980 --> 02:18:03,813
it's this,

3233
02:18:07,360 --> 02:18:10,240
it's a different mode of communication.

3234
02:18:10,960 --> 02:18:14,530
I think noogler gravitating towards
youtube because it's rough and ready.

3235
02:18:14,980 --> 02:18:15,281
It's like,

3236
02:18:15,281 --> 02:18:16,420
this is why Joe Rogan works.

3237
02:18:16,450 --> 02:18:18,460
It's like chosen are all made up.

3238
02:18:18,461 --> 02:18:21,520
These [inaudible] rear ended,

3239
02:18:21,521 --> 02:18:26,521
the smashed up truck [inaudible]
there's no printing the landscape up.

3240
02:18:38,260 --> 02:18:41,500
It's like here's the devotees
discussion in this three hours of it.

3241
02:18:41,501 --> 02:18:43,730
If you want to listen
less than if you don't,

3242
02:18:43,740 --> 02:18:48,740
then go hell [inaudible] states.

3243
02:18:50,410 --> 02:18:53,290
And it's also something that that's so
cool about youtube too is you hear this

3244
02:18:53,291 --> 02:18:56,890
idea that young people
have short attention spans.

3245
02:18:57,080 --> 02:18:57,401
It's like,

3246
02:18:57,401 --> 02:18:57,820
yeah,

3247
02:18:57,820 --> 02:19:01,290
except when it comes to [inaudible].

3248
02:19:01,290 --> 02:19:02,920
So it's very cool to see the shift.

3249
02:19:02,921 --> 02:19:05,410
But a lot of it is that
it's a death spiral.

3250
02:19:05,920 --> 02:19:09,490
And I think a lot of the polarization
in our society is actually a secondary

3251
02:19:09,491 --> 02:19:09,841
consequence.

3252
02:19:09,841 --> 02:19:10,674
Consequences.

3253
02:19:11,520 --> 02:19:14,380
It's like because the journalists are
more than one yesterday and so they're

3254
02:19:14,381 --> 02:19:19,381
just generating clickbait and that's
polarizing and hopefully that will stop

3255
02:19:20,320 --> 02:19:25,320
when the doc [inaudible] of junk.

3256
02:19:29,840 --> 02:19:32,510
I don't want to see the high
quality journalists was just fear.

3257
02:19:32,690 --> 02:19:36,140
But I don't think the high
quality journalists will
dissipated because I think

3258
02:19:36,141 --> 02:19:39,500
their message can move across mediums.

3259
02:19:40,150 --> 02:19:40,641
But I mean,

3260
02:19:40,641 --> 02:19:41,840
when I see CDC,

3261
02:19:42,440 --> 02:19:44,360
I got to watch CNBC struggle on youtube.

3262
02:19:44,361 --> 02:19:45,194
It's so comical.

3263
02:19:46,350 --> 02:19:47,183
It's like,

3264
02:19:47,300 --> 02:19:49,760
so I saw somebody with
CPC put it on Youtube,

3265
02:19:49,761 --> 02:19:51,950
it was 10 minutes long
and I want it to watch it.

3266
02:19:52,820 --> 02:19:57,550
And so I sat down to watch it
for three 32nd acts and I taught

3267
02:20:00,110 --> 02:20:02,180
for 10 minutes and you're damn content,

3268
02:20:02,210 --> 02:20:06,470
you really think I should pay a minute
and a half of my time to watch 10 minutes

3269
02:20:06,471 --> 02:20:07,280
of your condoms.

3270
02:20:07,280 --> 02:20:08,970
Then I couldn't click through the outs.

3271
02:20:09,260 --> 02:20:10,093
It's like,

3272
02:20:10,100 --> 02:20:11,240
so rule number one,

3273
02:20:11,330 --> 02:20:12,050
one app,

3274
02:20:12,050 --> 02:20:13,130
15 seconds long,

3275
02:20:13,190 --> 02:20:14,490
you can click through it for SAP.

3276
02:20:14,780 --> 02:20:15,470
That's the rule.

3277
02:20:15,470 --> 02:20:18,700
Not Three 32nd ads that
you have to sit through.

3278
02:20:19,000 --> 02:20:21,200
It's like have a little
respect for the media.

3279
02:20:21,470 --> 02:20:22,190
It's like no,

3280
02:20:22,190 --> 02:20:23,023
no respect.

3281
02:20:23,510 --> 02:20:25,910
Then upon comments were um,

3282
02:20:26,760 --> 02:20:27,500
no one lot,

3283
02:20:27,500 --> 02:20:32,500
just a lot to do that because your viewers
actually get to the comments and if

3284
02:20:33,441 --> 02:20:35,810
you can't hire someone to vet them,

3285
02:20:35,820 --> 02:20:37,610
you can just leaving the
down and comments alone.

3286
02:20:37,611 --> 02:20:38,470
That would be one thing.

3287
02:20:38,510 --> 02:20:39,530
Just let them happen.

3288
02:20:39,890 --> 02:20:40,570
You know,

3289
02:20:40,570 --> 02:20:44,240
maybe you need someone to weed out the
ones that are like so wretched that you

3290
02:20:44,241 --> 02:20:44,370
know,

3291
02:20:44,370 --> 02:20:47,380
we need to tell that you know what's up.

3292
02:20:47,960 --> 02:20:50,320
What would you call some demented troll,

3293
02:20:51,600 --> 02:20:52,200
you know,

3294
02:20:52,200 --> 02:20:53,690
but maybe you can just leave them alone.

3295
02:20:54,130 --> 02:20:55,670
They won't pay any attention to the media.

3296
02:20:56,150 --> 02:20:57,470
And so I look at that.

3297
02:20:57,471 --> 02:20:58,580
I think it's no bunny wonder,

3298
02:20:58,610 --> 02:20:59,930
you guys can't get any traction.

3299
02:20:59,960 --> 02:21:02,000
You've got no respect for
the medium whatsoever.

3300
02:21:02,450 --> 02:21:03,830
You're not going to make the transition.

3301
02:21:04,370 --> 02:21:07,730
So I'm irritated that CDC and
that's kind of good reason to,

3302
02:21:08,210 --> 02:21:09,870
and that sort of like,

3303
02:21:09,900 --> 02:21:13,280
it's coming towards the media in general,

3304
02:21:13,310 --> 02:21:14,540
but they're in serious trouble.

3305
02:21:14,870 --> 02:21:15,703
So,

3306
02:21:15,800 --> 02:21:17,600
so vice was a perfect example of that.

3307
02:21:17,601 --> 02:21:19,460
It's like you talk for two hours.

3308
02:21:19,461 --> 02:21:20,294
When they do,

3309
02:21:20,390 --> 02:21:23,980
they take the most contentious part of
it just to show how damn smart they are.

3310
02:21:23,981 --> 02:21:26,580
And you'll pick the people who
are watching it to see through it,

3311
02:21:26,600 --> 02:21:27,433
which they could.

3312
02:21:27,740 --> 02:21:29,300
It's like to hell with you guys.

3313
02:21:29,301 --> 02:21:29,750
It's like,

3314
02:21:29,750 --> 02:21:31,130
that's so cheap and wretched.

3315
02:21:31,450 --> 02:21:32,283
It's pathetic.

3316
02:21:32,450 --> 02:21:33,650
It's absolutely pathetic.

3317
02:21:33,920 --> 02:21:35,740
All you're doing is making things worse.

3318
02:21:36,040 --> 02:21:38,830
In in Lindsay shepherd situations,

3319
02:21:38,831 --> 02:21:43,831
she was recording her own side just as
insurance fraud and dishonesty from the

3320
02:21:43,851 --> 02:21:44,600
other side.

3321
02:21:44,600 --> 02:21:44,871
Yeah.

3322
02:21:44,871 --> 02:21:45,051
Well,

3323
02:21:45,051 --> 02:21:47,960
that's another thing that I've often
thought about it is just to record the

3324
02:21:47,961 --> 02:21:48,794
whole interview,

3325
02:21:48,830 --> 02:21:52,310
but I'm more or less willing at the
moment to let the chips fall where they

3326
02:21:52,311 --> 02:21:52,910
will.

3327
02:21:52,910 --> 02:21:53,721
And most of the time,

3328
02:21:53,721 --> 02:21:53,961
you know,

3329
02:21:53,961 --> 02:21:58,961
most of the time there are many
people with whom I've sat down and had

3330
02:21:59,331 --> 02:22:02,450
discussions where things
were played straight.

3331
02:22:02,510 --> 02:22:04,580
And I would say it's
actually the majority,

3332
02:22:05,240 --> 02:22:09,260
but there's a pretty pernicious
minority that does what?

3333
02:22:09,261 --> 02:22:09,920
Vice,

3334
02:22:09,920 --> 02:22:10,753
it's like

3335
02:22:11,840 --> 02:22:12,830
there's no excuse for them.

3336
02:22:13,550 --> 02:22:14,420
There's no excuse for it.

3337
02:22:15,200 --> 02:22:16,033
It's like,

3338
02:22:16,690 --> 02:22:17,700
you've got no principles.

3339
02:22:18,920 --> 02:22:20,330
Let's make this salacious.

3340
02:22:20,390 --> 02:22:20,691
It's like,

3341
02:22:20,691 --> 02:22:21,590
these things are important.

3342
02:22:21,591 --> 02:22:22,424
You Morons.

3343
02:22:22,660 --> 02:22:22,941
It's like,

3344
02:22:22,941 --> 02:22:23,774
get it together.

3345
02:22:24,050 --> 02:22:25,830
Don't muck about hell.

3346
02:22:25,840 --> 02:22:25,980
You

3347
02:22:25,980 --> 02:22:26,813
think you're doing well.

3348
02:22:27,800 --> 02:22:30,400
It's like up yours [inaudible]

3349
02:22:33,390 --> 02:22:34,620
you can't do it over to content.

3350
02:22:34,621 --> 02:22:36,860
So you'll do it on
manipulation that's there.

3351
02:22:36,861 --> 02:22:37,780
The whole g for your life.

3352
02:22:37,950 --> 02:22:39,240
I didn't have to do it on content,

3353
02:22:39,420 --> 02:22:40,860
so I'll do it on manipulation.

3354
02:22:41,130 --> 02:22:46,130
The model of Vice [inaudible]

3355
02:22:58,200 --> 02:23:03,200
[inaudible].
