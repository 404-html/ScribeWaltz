1
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:10,530
Let me just explain it to explain to the
viewers here why this isn't just some

2
00:00:10,531 --> 00:00:13,050
like psychological geek conversation.

3
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:16,170
This is actually really relevant to a
lot of the things that we'll be talking

4
00:00:16,171 --> 00:00:19,500
about and that your audience probably
cares about because one of the most

5
00:00:19,501 --> 00:00:24,270
contested ideas and the social sciences
is the idea of innateness and the ideas.

6
00:00:24,271 --> 00:00:24,480
Well,

7
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:25,590
if something has a need,

8
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:26,820
then it can't.

9
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:30,990
It can't vary across societies and if it
varies across the side is then it's not

10
00:00:30,991 --> 00:00:31,620
a neat.

11
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:32,880
And if gender barriers,

12
00:00:32,881 --> 00:00:35,590
if masculinity or femininity
vary across societies,

13
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:36,620
there is not an eight.

14
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:38,010
It's socially constructed,

15
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:40,920
but that's the wrong
understanding of the neatness.

16
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:44,600
The definition that I use comes from
Gary Marcus was actually a neuroscientist

17
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:45,181
here at Nyu.

18
00:00:45,181 --> 00:00:47,580
He says innate doesn't mean hardwired.

19
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:48,450
There's almost nothing.

20
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:48,971
Interestingly,

21
00:00:48,971 --> 00:00:53,100
it's hardwired in eight means
structured in advance of experience,

22
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,080
but that experience can still revise it.

23
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:58,440
And boy does that work for gender,

24
00:00:58,470 --> 00:00:59,460
for almost everything.

25
00:01:00,910 --> 00:01:03,750
Almost everything that we're not
a blank slate about anything.

26
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:05,790
And something used to
tell my students at Uva,

27
00:01:05,791 --> 00:01:07,710
I taught at Uva for 16 years is,

28
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:08,490
you know,

29
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:09,930
everything's a social construction,

30
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:11,970
masculinity,

31
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:13,200
femininity,

32
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:14,423
cancer,

33
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:15,690
the sun,

34
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:16,440
death,

35
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:17,273
everything.

36
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:20,400
There's a social construction for you
won't find a society that doesn't have

37
00:01:20,401 --> 00:01:21,600
thoughts about these things.

38
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:26,930
But the fact that societies have social
constructions tells us nothing about

39
00:01:27,031 --> 00:01:30,660
whether there is not also an
underlying biological reality.

40
00:01:30,661 --> 00:01:32,220
And in almost all cases there is,

41
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:34,030
you wouldn't be able to communicate,

42
00:01:34,031 --> 00:01:36,340
which is one of Eo Wilson's comments,

43
00:01:36,341 --> 00:01:36,551
right?

44
00:01:36,551 --> 00:01:36,820
When,

45
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:39,130
I mean Wilson is the
entomologist to study down.

46
00:01:39,131 --> 00:01:42,790
So it's Harvard and also wrote number
of books about sociobiology that got him

47
00:01:42,791 --> 00:01:44,290
in trouble with the radical leftists.

48
00:01:44,291 --> 00:01:45,124
And he said,

49
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,020
even if we could communicate with ants,

50
00:01:47,021 --> 00:01:50,650
there'd be nothing to say to each other
because they're fundamental mode of

51
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:55,000
being in the world is based on motivations
and interests that are so different

52
00:01:55,001 --> 00:01:57,580
from ours that there wouldn't be
any structure for communication.

53
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:01,390
And you can kind of tell that with regards
to the animals that we make friends

54
00:02:01,391 --> 00:02:01,631
with,

55
00:02:01,631 --> 00:02:01,901
right?

56
00:02:01,901 --> 00:02:04,710
We're much more likely to make
friends with animals who has a,

57
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:08,380
who have a fundamental biological and
social nature that's very close to ours,

58
00:02:08,410 --> 00:02:09,190
like dogs,

59
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:11,260
because we can basically
speak their language,

60
00:02:11,261 --> 00:02:14,790
even though not completely
a mammo language of love.

61
00:02:14,791 --> 00:02:15,250
And you know,

62
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:17,310
I miss you and I want to play with you.

63
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:17,700
Yeah,

64
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:18,121
that's right.

65
00:02:18,121 --> 00:02:18,390
Yeah,

66
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:18,810
exactly.

67
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:19,620
And that bonding.
