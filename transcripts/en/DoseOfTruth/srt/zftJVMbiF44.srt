1
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:09,243
All right.

2
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:14,310
We've been talking about

3
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:20,900
a code of representations in some sense

4
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:27,940
of symbolic representation and I've
been trying to guide you through some

5
00:00:28,011 --> 00:00:32,030
developing understanding of that code
of symbolic representation so that as we

6
00:00:32,031 --> 00:00:33,320
progress through the course,

7
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:38,660
you'll have the ground rules in some
sense for interpreting all the different

8
00:00:38,661 --> 00:00:39,830
theories that we encounter.

9
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,740
And we're going to continue that today.

10
00:00:42,741 --> 00:00:47,120
This is the last lecture on sort of
pre psychoanalytic conceptions of

11
00:00:47,121 --> 00:00:51,770
personality and then we moved
to Piaget and then to you.

12
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:52,753
So

13
00:00:55,340 --> 00:01:00,340
the first thing I tried to point out
to you was that social primates like us

14
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:05,420
likely have a cognitive structure that's
based on social categories and that

15
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:09,110
when our cognitive systems elaborate it
up enough to start thinking about the

16
00:01:09,111 --> 00:01:12,860
world in more abstract terms
beyond our immediate environment,

17
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:14,960
there's a high probability
that we learned,

18
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:20,020
we used the same cognitive structures
that had evolved to begin the process of

19
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:23,090
abstract conceptualization.

20
00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:28,220
And so in some sense you could say we
used our knowledge of personality to start

21
00:01:28,221 --> 00:01:33,221
to understand the external world based
on the initial axiomatic assumption.

22
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:35,310
It's not a cognitive assumption.

23
00:01:35,311 --> 00:01:40,311
It was a perceptual assumption that
the world was like a personality.

24
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:41,840
And we do this automatically.

25
00:01:41,841 --> 00:01:43,430
So I want to show you a little video here.

26
00:01:43,431 --> 00:01:44,540
This is quite a famous video.

27
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:45,620
Um,

28
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:50,620
it shows you how easily you can
abstract out and narrative from the most

29
00:01:51,261 --> 00:01:52,820
abstract of events.

30
00:01:59,110 --> 00:01:59,291
Okay,

31
00:01:59,291 --> 00:02:00,490
so watch what happens.

32
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:11,721
Okay,

33
00:02:11,721 --> 00:02:13,070
let's watch that one more time.

34
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:26,750
So it's something like,

35
00:02:26,751 --> 00:02:27,680
we'll go over it again.

36
00:02:27,681 --> 00:02:29,780
It's something like the little circle.

37
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,390
The poor little circle is trying
to escape and when it does,

38
00:02:32,391 --> 00:02:34,910
the bad gray triangle comes
up and sort of steals it.

39
00:02:34,911 --> 00:02:39,911
And then a blue triangle has a little
scrap with the gray triangle and puts the

40
00:02:40,431 --> 00:02:43,310
little yellow or the little circle
back into its safe and closure.

41
00:02:43,311 --> 00:02:43,581
Right?

42
00:02:43,581 --> 00:02:45,140
And so the,

43
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:49,700
the reason that that demonstration was
developed was to indicate or two and also

44
00:02:49,701 --> 00:02:53,090
to test how little
information you really needed,

45
00:02:53,091 --> 00:02:58,070
how low resolution the information was
that you needed in order to perceive,

46
00:02:58,071 --> 00:02:59,150
to directly perceive.

47
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:00,550
That was like a narrative.

48
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:01,360
So,

49
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:01,601
you know,

50
00:03:01,601 --> 00:03:03,970
and that's a relatively
complicated narrative.

51
00:03:03,971 --> 00:03:08,971
All things considered for a square two
triangles and a circle interacting for

52
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:10,540
maybe three or four seconds.

53
00:03:10,541 --> 00:03:11,080
So,

54
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:11,490
you know,

55
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:11,610
the,

56
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:16,270
the point of this demonstration is to
indicate just exactly how prepared you are

57
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:18,610
to read the world in narrative terms.
