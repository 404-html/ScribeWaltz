1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:01,680
Those are the viewers who don't know.

2
00:00:01,681 --> 00:00:04,980
Headstart was a nationwide attempt to,

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:10,400
to add additional education to
the lives of disadvantaged kids,

4
00:00:10,411 --> 00:00:11,041
especially,

5
00:00:11,041 --> 00:00:11,720
you know,

6
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:12,080
at the,

7
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:13,230
at the preschool level.

8
00:00:13,231 --> 00:00:15,210
And basically what happened,

9
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:19,890
what was that they actually did show
improvements in academic achievement

10
00:00:19,891 --> 00:00:20,724
initially.

11
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:24,090
So in grade one and grade two they
were performing above their peers.

12
00:00:24,091 --> 00:00:26,580
But then the difference in improvement,

13
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:30,090
the difference in performance started
to decrease and then by both the grade

14
00:00:30,091 --> 00:00:30,661
grade five,

15
00:00:30,661 --> 00:00:33,240
grade six that differences
and disappeared completely.

16
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:35,520
So there was no evidence
whatsoever of that,

17
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:38,820
of that either have a stable one time,

18
00:00:38,821 --> 00:00:43,350
longterm gain in cognitive ability or
what people were really hoping was that if

19
00:00:43,351 --> 00:00:44,670
you intervene early enough,

20
00:00:44,671 --> 00:00:45,960
you get something that would sort of,

21
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:50,400
Paul would turn into a positive feedback
loop and the gains would actually

22
00:00:50,401 --> 00:00:51,810
advance across time.

23
00:00:51,811 --> 00:00:55,920
And what ended up happening with the
headstart research basically was the

24
00:00:55,921 --> 00:00:58,830
conclusion that it produced no
cognitive improvements whatsoever.

25
00:00:58,831 --> 00:01:01,570
Although more kids who
went through headstart,

26
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:02,400
um,

27
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:03,810
graduated from high school,

28
00:01:03,811 --> 00:01:05,040
fewer of them were delinquent,

29
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:05,903
more of them,

30
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:08,790
fewer of them became pregnant
teenage in the teenage years.

31
00:01:08,791 --> 00:01:10,380
And more of them went to colleges.

32
00:01:10,381 --> 00:01:13,110
But that seemed to be because
they were better socialized,

33
00:01:13,111 --> 00:01:14,730
not because they were in any way.

34
00:01:14,731 --> 00:01:15,900
It had been made smarter.

35
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:20,220
So that was a really tremendous
disappointment because it was a bipartisan

36
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:24,660
attempt to come to grips with the
fundamental issues that sort of be deviled

37
00:01:24,661 --> 00:01:26,580
structural poverty in the United States.

38
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:28,340
No one was happy about that outcome.

39
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:28,980
I can tell you.
