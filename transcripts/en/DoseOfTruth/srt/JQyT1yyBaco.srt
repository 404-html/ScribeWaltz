1
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:11,740
Now,
as we know for our kick and traditional

2
00:00:11,741 --> 00:00:15,010
culture is the symbolic return to chaos
is equivalent to preparing a new

3
00:00:15,011 --> 00:00:18,040
creation.
So the death of your current state of

4
00:00:18,041 --> 00:00:20,320
being can be the preparation for a new
Ba.

5
00:00:20,321 --> 00:00:22,420
Now,
one of the things the cycle analysts

6
00:00:22,421 --> 00:00:24,520
say,
and this is implicit in he adds

7
00:00:24,521 --> 00:00:26,380
discussion of the somatic
transformation,

8
00:00:26,381 --> 00:00:31,381
is if you do this voluntarily,
you have a much better chance of doing

9
00:00:31,961 --> 00:00:35,320
it successfully.
So the rule is while if you go out to

10
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:38,890
hunt for a dragon and you're in pretty
good shape while you're doing it and

11
00:00:38,891 --> 00:00:41,260
you're all prepared,
then the damn thing might not eat you.

12
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:44,550
But if you're lying in bed and you know
you're covered with cheesy dust and new,

13
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:47,050
you're hung over from three days worth
of drinking,

14
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:49,900
then the dragon will just eat you.
And it's probably a good thing for

15
00:00:49,901 --> 00:00:51,760
everyone that it did.
So.

16
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:55,210
So the point is,
be prepared and part of the way that

17
00:00:55,211 --> 00:00:58,690
you're prepared is by being awake and
having the,

18
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:03,280
uh,
the many sources of power that are at

19
00:01:03,281 --> 00:01:07,150
your fingertips that are part of your
biological and cultural inheritance at,

20
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:09,640
at the ready so that you can respond.

21
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:14,950
It follows that we may interpret the
psychic chaos of the future showman as a

22
00:01:14,951 --> 00:01:18,160
sign that the profane man is being
dissolved and a new personality being

23
00:01:18,161 --> 00:01:23,161
prepared for birth transformation,
constant theme,

24
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:26,290
Paradise,
Paradise Lost and redemption.

25
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:29,800
That's the story of mankind.
We're in a fallen state.

26
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:30,730
Why is that?
Well,

27
00:01:30,731 --> 00:01:33,810
because things aren't perfect and they
could be better and everyone's

28
00:01:33,811 --> 00:01:36,460
suffering,
so things have fallen apart.

29
00:01:36,610 --> 00:01:39,250
They're always in the state of being
fallen apart.

30
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:42,250
And what are we trying to do?
What we're trying to put them back

31
00:01:42,251 --> 00:01:45,190
together.
That's the eternal story of mankind

32
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:45,610
that.
