1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:03,870
Even if there's a minority of
good in a place that isn't good,

2
00:00:03,871 --> 00:00:05,610
it won't be slated for destruction.

3
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:07,290
That's kind of a good thing.

4
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:12,950
And the third is a minority of good in a
place can keep it from being destroyed.

5
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:16,050
And that's a really good thing too.

6
00:00:16,051 --> 00:00:17,670
And I believe that as well.

7
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:21,660
I think that good is
more powerful than evil.

8
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:23,010
Naivety isn't.

9
00:00:23,011 --> 00:00:24,390
But I think that good is,

10
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:27,690
and I think that in a
place that's corrupt,

11
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:32,280
a minority of people who stand forth
against the corruption can prevail.

12
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:34,463
Now,

13
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:39,941
you know,

14
00:00:39,941 --> 00:00:40,321
I think,

15
00:00:40,321 --> 00:00:42,700
I think one of the best
examples of that again,

16
00:00:42,701 --> 00:00:47,560
was all Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn because
he was in the terrible work camps when he

17
00:00:47,561 --> 00:00:48,191
wrote his book.

18
00:00:48,191 --> 00:00:49,480
He memorized most of it,

19
00:00:49,630 --> 00:00:53,350
which is not an easy thing to do when
it's 2100 pages long and set in very tiny

20
00:00:53,351 --> 00:00:54,184
font.

21
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,510
And he memorized most of it.

22
00:00:56,050 --> 00:01:01,050
And then he wrote it and it was one of
the things that brought down the Soviet

23
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:01,950
Union.

24
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:02,170
You know,

25
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:06,400
it was published in the 1970s
first of all in Wa in the West.

26
00:01:06,401 --> 00:01:08,650
And the first thing that happened,

27
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,230
at least initially was that

28
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:14,093
the

29
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:18,630
communism as an ethical
system lost absolutely all
credibility whatsoever among

30
00:01:18,631 --> 00:01:20,520
anyone who is even vaguely educated.

31
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:23,490
Immediately upon the publication
of the Gulag archipelago,

32
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:26,400
he pulled the moral slots
out from underneath it.

33
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:29,520
And the book was definitely one
of the reasons there were many,

34
00:01:29,521 --> 00:01:34,440
but was definitely one of the reasons
why the rotten system crumbled and fell

35
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:35,520
without a war.

36
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:40,880
And that's a great example of how one
person can take on a tyranny and prevail.

37
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:43,103
So,

38
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:45,540
and he's not the only person
who did that sort of thing.

39
00:01:45,541 --> 00:01:47,010
Cause what Gandhi did the same thing.

40
00:01:47,011 --> 00:01:47,580
I mean,

41
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:50,070
I don't think the English
were the Russians,

42
00:01:50,071 --> 00:01:50,910
but you know,

43
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,710
things were not so good in India.

44
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:57,390
And what Gandhi did in India under the
influence by the way of Leo Tolstoy,

45
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:58,793
um,

46
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:05,410
was also a remarkable example of a single
person intervening in a catastrophe

47
00:02:05,411 --> 00:02:06,130
and,

48
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:06,670
and,

49
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:09,010
and setting it far more
right than it could be.
