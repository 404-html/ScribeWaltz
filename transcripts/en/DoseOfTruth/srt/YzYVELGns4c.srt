1
00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:11,540
Deals with alcoholism and
at the biological level,

2
00:00:11,541 --> 00:00:15,800
that's what I did my phd thesis on and
much of my early published papers where I

3
00:00:15,801 --> 00:00:19,580
learned about brain function because
alcohol affects every part of the brain.

4
00:00:19,581 --> 00:00:21,140
So I learned a lot about the brain.

5
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:23,570
What prompted my interest in that area.

6
00:00:23,571 --> 00:00:24,590
And you're a parent shift,

7
00:00:24,591 --> 00:00:26,360
two issues clustered around personality.

8
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:30,710
While I was always interested in
motivation for drug and alcohol abuse,

9
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:34,650
you know what it was the
drove people to use drugs of,

10
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:35,200
of,

11
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,410
of abuse,

12
00:00:36,411 --> 00:00:37,244
let's say.

13
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:38,233
And um,

14
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:41,720
I got the opportunity to study
at Miguel under Dr Robert Peel,

15
00:00:41,721 --> 00:00:45,830
who was an excellent supervisor
and he was deeply involved with,

16
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:46,640
um,

17
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,890
drug and alcohol abuse research,

18
00:00:49,130 --> 00:00:51,140
looking at motivation for alcoholism.

19
00:00:51,141 --> 00:00:53,150
And he offered me a
position in his lab and,

20
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:55,100
and that was what he was working on.

21
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:55,581
And I thought,

22
00:00:55,581 --> 00:00:55,761
well,

23
00:00:55,761 --> 00:00:58,100
that was one of my cardinal interests,

24
00:00:58,101 --> 00:00:59,690
although perhaps not my,

25
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:02,060
my fundamental interest,

26
00:01:02,061 --> 00:01:06,440
which even at that point had to do with
motivation for totalitarianism and the

27
00:01:06,441 --> 00:01:08,330
Commission of atrocity in the service of,

28
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:09,920
of group belief.

29
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:11,203
But I thought,

30
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:11,601
well,

31
00:01:11,601 --> 00:01:16,601
it's a broad topic and I could learn a
lot about biology and neurobiology as a

32
00:01:16,671 --> 00:01:19,130
consequence of working on
something that was so biological.

33
00:01:19,131 --> 00:01:19,910
So my,

34
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:23,510
my early work in psychology was extremely
biologically oriented and it was

35
00:01:23,511 --> 00:01:24,740
unbelievably useful.

36
00:01:24,741 --> 00:01:28,250
I learned a lot from the animal
experimentalists in particular people like

37
00:01:28,251 --> 00:01:30,830
Jeffrey Gray and later Jaak Panksepp.

38
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:31,940
Um,

39
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:33,950
I have a reading list at Jordan B.

40
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:37,340
Peterson Dotcom that outlines
some of those emotional,

41
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:39,320
so those books on emotional neuroscience.

42
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:40,633
Um,

43
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:42,830
what was my,

44
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:44,090
why did I shift?

45
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:46,190
Well there was a variety of reasons.

46
00:01:46,191 --> 00:01:51,191
One was that the National Institute of
Alcohol Abuse and alcoholism and I AAA,

47
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:56,770
which funded grant research in the United
States essentially made the corn of

48
00:01:56,871 --> 00:01:58,550
research I was doing with Robert Peale.

49
00:01:58,551 --> 00:01:59,384
Impossible.

50
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,670
And it's part of the consequence.

51
00:02:01,671 --> 00:02:04,490
I think this is one of the things that
the universities are doing so terribly

52
00:02:04,491 --> 00:02:04,821
wrong,

53
00:02:04,821 --> 00:02:09,821
is the ethics committees made our
research impossible both to fund and to

54
00:02:10,670 --> 00:02:11,180
implement.

55
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:12,013
So here's why.

56
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:14,300
So we were bringing people into the lab.

57
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,120
So here's who we pick for subjects.

58
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:19,730
If you are going to be a subject
in one of our experiments,

59
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:24,910
you had to be a young man and you had
to have an alcoholic father and an

60
00:02:25,971 --> 00:02:30,380
alcoholic grandfather and at least
one other first or second degree male

61
00:02:30,381 --> 00:02:31,640
alcoholic relative.

62
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:34,213
Well,

63
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:35,480
I hope I'm back again.

64
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:37,071
You know,

65
00:02:37,071 --> 00:02:40,430
my software updated and
obviously the update has a bug,

66
00:02:40,431 --> 00:02:41,750
so that's rather annoying.

67
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:42,833
Um,

68
00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:44,720
apologies for that.

69
00:02:44,721 --> 00:02:45,554
Once again.

70
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:48,740
So back to the alcoholism discussion.

71
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,353
Um,

72
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:51,553
where was I?

73
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:52,423
Oh yes.

74
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:56,090
So we would get these subjects.

75
00:02:56,091 --> 00:02:56,301
I,

76
00:02:56,301 --> 00:02:57,320
I mentioned who they were,

77
00:02:57,350 --> 00:02:59,270
they were young men who weren't alcoholic,

78
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:00,790
but who drank socially,

79
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:02,890
who had an alcoholic father,

80
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:04,900
an alcoholic grandfather,

81
00:03:04,901 --> 00:03:07,390
and at least one other
male alcoholic relative.

82
00:03:07,391 --> 00:03:09,100
Now why did we pick subjects like that?

83
00:03:09,101 --> 00:03:09,251
Well,

84
00:03:09,251 --> 00:03:13,360
we knew alcoholism ran in families and
we couldn't really study its transmission

85
00:03:13,361 --> 00:03:17,620
and women because if you're a female
alcoholic and you drink when you have a

86
00:03:17,621 --> 00:03:18,490
child in Utero,

87
00:03:18,491 --> 00:03:23,320
then the child can have fetal alcohol
syndrome and whatever abnormalities in

88
00:03:23,321 --> 00:03:28,321
psychophysiological response
or psychopathologies
might be associated with,

89
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:29,270
uh,

90
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:33,850
their alcoholism can easily be masked by
the presence of fetal alcohol syndrome.

91
00:03:34,570 --> 00:03:39,570
So we couldn't use women and besides
alcoholism is a problem that fundamentally

92
00:03:39,821 --> 00:03:40,810
characterized as men.

93
00:03:40,811 --> 00:03:42,220
Although there are female alcoholics,

94
00:03:42,221 --> 00:03:45,700
I think it's four to one if I remember
correctly from from those days,

95
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,410
it's four to one male to female,

96
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,393
so it was,

97
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:51,550
we know when we thought if we
concentrated on those who had the highest

98
00:03:51,551 --> 00:03:55,150
probability of developing
alcoholism because of their
loaded family history that

99
00:03:55,151 --> 00:03:58,900
we could shed some light on the mechanisms
associated with alcoholism and that

100
00:03:58,901 --> 00:04:00,400
would be useful for men and for women.

101
00:04:00,401 --> 00:04:02,470
So we studied sons of male alcoholics,

102
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:05,140
sons of multigenerational male alcoholics.

103
00:04:05,141 --> 00:04:06,160
Those were our target group,

104
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:08,050
very hard populations to find.

105
00:04:08,051 --> 00:04:12,340
We have people hired full time to do
nothing but find us research subjects and

106
00:04:12,341 --> 00:04:16,780
so we did relatively small end studies
because we were lucky if we could gather

107
00:04:16,781 --> 00:04:20,500
four or five subjects a month
in the Montreal urban area.

108
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:21,761
Anyways,

109
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:23,740
we did discover a lot about alcoholism.

110
00:04:23,741 --> 00:04:24,970
We discovered for example,

111
00:04:24,971 --> 00:04:29,080
that if people with this
multigenerational history,

112
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:31,000
a substantial proportion of them,

113
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:36,280
if they drank enough alcohol to move
their blood level up above 0.08 which is

114
00:04:36,281 --> 00:04:37,750
legal intoxication level.

115
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:40,810
And if they did that relatively
short period of time,

116
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:43,750
then their heart rate
would increase above,

117
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:47,710
I think the average was about 12 beats
per minute compared to the standard

118
00:04:47,711 --> 00:04:48,490
control of,

119
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:51,370
of zero zero or one or two.

120
00:04:51,371 --> 00:04:52,420
It was is very low.

121
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:53,351
And so,

122
00:04:53,351 --> 00:04:57,130
and then we did figure out over time
our whole team that that seemed to be a

123
00:04:57,131 --> 00:05:02,131
consequence of susceptibility to alcohol's
effect on opioid production in the

124
00:05:02,321 --> 00:05:02,651
brain.

125
00:05:02,651 --> 00:05:03,640
And Secondary,

126
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:04,720
uh,

127
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,250
opioid effects on dopamine,

128
00:05:06,251 --> 00:05:10,570
which is both opiates and dopamine
are primarily primary reward chemical.

129
00:05:10,571 --> 00:05:14,140
So it looked to us like people with
multigenerational family histories of

130
00:05:14,141 --> 00:05:16,750
alcoholism got an opiate
response from alcohol.

131
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:17,890
So,

132
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:22,060
but we had to get people drunk
in order to find this response.

133
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:23,800
And it turned out that 0.08,

134
00:05:23,801 --> 00:05:27,430
which was the legal limit at that time
for driving was approximately the place

135
00:05:27,431 --> 00:05:31,570
where we saw the psychophysiological
effects and also saw fairly pronounced

136
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:35,590
cognitive and motor effects of
alcohol because we also studied that.

137
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,690
So now to bring,

138
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:41,380
we bring people into the lab and we'd
give them three large shots of alcohol

139
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:42,910
that they consumed in 10 minutes.

140
00:05:42,911 --> 00:05:44,440
We use laboratory alcohol,

141
00:05:44,441 --> 00:05:46,880
which was I think 95% pure alcohol,

142
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:48,190
usually put it in orange juice.

143
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,553
Um,

144
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:51,220
and so people would be,

145
00:05:51,221 --> 00:05:51,460
you know,

146
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:52,780
reasonably intoxicated.

147
00:05:52,781 --> 00:05:56,500
And then we would let them sober
up until they were at 0.04,

148
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,460
which is half legal intoxication,

149
00:05:58,461 --> 00:05:59,450
which we thought was useful.

150
00:05:59,451 --> 00:06:02,090
And then we put them in a cabin
and they'd go home and we,

151
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:02,661
you know,

152
00:06:02,661 --> 00:06:06,980
we had our odd mishap now and then
someone would throw up and that was,

153
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:14,750
well I'm at least getting better
at fixing it when it screws up now.

154
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:16,310
So um,

155
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:17,620
you know when it anyways,

156
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:22,130
now and then we would have somebody who
would be becoming all in the lab and

157
00:06:22,131 --> 00:06:23,150
that was always unpleasant.

158
00:06:23,151 --> 00:06:27,140
But then we also let people sober up and
it actually takes quite a long time to

159
00:06:27,141 --> 00:06:28,790
go from point a to 0.04,

160
00:06:28,791 --> 00:06:30,980
especially if you're a big guy cause your,

161
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:33,500
your dose of alcohol is
proportionate to your body weight.

162
00:06:33,501 --> 00:06:36,260
And so we used to have people wait
in the lab for a couple of hours.

163
00:06:36,261 --> 00:06:36,591
So you know,

164
00:06:36,591 --> 00:06:41,120
and they were not very happy necessarily
about having to wait before we paid

165
00:06:41,121 --> 00:06:41,954
them and so forth.

166
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:42,910
And,

167
00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:45,800
and if we didn't treat
them extraordinarily well,

168
00:06:45,801 --> 00:06:46,611
which we tried to do,

169
00:06:46,611 --> 00:06:49,550
then of course they were much less
likely to come back and participate in

170
00:06:49,551 --> 00:06:50,384
another study.

171
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:53,330
And since it was very difficult
to get research subjects,

172
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:57,020
then we wanted to treat them very well
apart from the fact that we would have

173
00:06:57,021 --> 00:06:57,920
done that anyways.

174
00:06:58,310 --> 00:06:59,143
But then,

175
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:00,260
and I AAA said,

176
00:07:00,261 --> 00:07:00,381
well,

177
00:07:00,381 --> 00:07:04,070
you can't let your research subjects
go home until they have a blood alcohol

178
00:07:04,071 --> 00:07:04,821
level of point.

179
00:07:04,821 --> 00:07:06,230
Oh two was like,

180
00:07:06,231 --> 00:07:08,090
we would have had to
have people in our lab,

181
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:08,781
you know,

182
00:07:08,781 --> 00:07:09,810
sobering up for

183
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:15,040
okay.

184
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,450
For six to eight hours.

185
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,440
This keeps happening.

186
00:07:17,441 --> 00:07:18,700
I'm very sorry about this,

187
00:07:18,701 --> 00:07:19,534
everyone.

188
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:22,453
Okay.

189
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:26,380
I don't know what to say about it except
that that's a consequence of software

190
00:07:26,381 --> 00:07:27,430
updates I suppose.

191
00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:28,923
Um,

192
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:33,903
anyways,

193
00:07:34,570 --> 00:07:37,930
so that made it impossible because we
just couldn't keep people in the lab for

194
00:07:37,931 --> 00:07:38,351
that long.

195
00:07:38,351 --> 00:07:41,050
All it did was annoyed them to death
and then they hated us and they,

196
00:07:41,051 --> 00:07:41,440
you know,

197
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:44,590
people would get quite irritable
and upset and no bloody wonder.

198
00:07:44,890 --> 00:07:46,270
So then also,

199
00:07:46,271 --> 00:07:50,230
and I AAA decided that half our subjects
had to be women or we couldn't get

200
00:07:50,231 --> 00:07:51,064
funding.

201
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:52,293
Well,

202
00:07:52,450 --> 00:07:52,661
no,

203
00:07:52,661 --> 00:07:53,860
our subjects couldn't be women.

204
00:07:53,861 --> 00:07:58,420
It was impossible to do the kind of
research that we were doing with women for

205
00:07:58,421 --> 00:07:59,740
the reasons that I just don't like.

206
00:07:59,741 --> 00:07:59,891
Well,

207
00:07:59,891 --> 00:08:00,724
first of all,

208
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:01,893
um,

209
00:08:01,930 --> 00:08:05,860
alcoholism doesn't affect women
as much as it affects men.

210
00:08:06,130 --> 00:08:09,850
Depression and anxiety tend to affect
women more than it's perfectly reasonable

211
00:08:09,851 --> 00:08:10,661
to study those things.

212
00:08:10,661 --> 00:08:11,920
But that isn't what we were doing.

213
00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:12,821
And,

214
00:08:12,821 --> 00:08:13,654
uh,

215
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:18,440
and then we couldn't do
multigenerational studies for,

216
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:22,520
for genetic predisposition with women
because of the fetal alcohol syndrome

217
00:08:22,521 --> 00:08:23,354
problem.

218
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:24,201
And you know,

219
00:08:24,201 --> 00:08:24,861
this was something,

220
00:08:24,861 --> 00:08:26,540
I think this came in under the Clintons,

221
00:08:26,541 --> 00:08:31,541
this re requirement for
absolute gender equality in,

222
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:33,140
in subject selection.

223
00:08:33,141 --> 00:08:36,080
And they didn't give a damn if that
meant that there were certain kinds of

224
00:08:36,081 --> 00:08:38,120
research that just
couldn't be done anymore.

225
00:08:38,121 --> 00:08:39,950
And so I had to stop doing it.

226
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:44,000
And no one's really doing that kind of
research anymore because it's just too

227
00:08:44,001 --> 00:08:44,834
difficult.

228
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:47,780
It's like it was always a pain because
it was really hard to get the subjects

229
00:08:47,781 --> 00:08:51,560
and then you had to get people quite
intoxicated and then you had to deal with

230
00:08:51,561 --> 00:08:54,500
them when they were drunk and you had
to do your psychophysiological recording

231
00:08:54,501 --> 00:08:55,410
and all that of thing.

232
00:08:55,411 --> 00:08:57,390
And then they had to
sober up and you know,

233
00:08:57,391 --> 00:08:58,530
it was complicated.

234
00:08:58,530 --> 00:09:00,720
Clinical research is unbelievably,

235
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:02,730
unbelievably complicated and difficult.

236
00:09:02,731 --> 00:09:03,451
And then yeah,

237
00:09:03,451 --> 00:09:05,610
I would like to more restrictions
to it and people just go,

238
00:09:05,611 --> 00:09:06,001
oh,

239
00:09:06,001 --> 00:09:06,361
okay,

240
00:09:06,361 --> 00:09:07,081
well we,

241
00:09:07,081 --> 00:09:11,190
I guess we won't study
the psychophysiological
consequences of alcohol anymore

242
00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:13,200
or so people would use low doses,

243
00:09:13,201 --> 00:09:13,441
you know,

244
00:09:13,441 --> 00:09:17,490
and only get their subject's blood
alcohol level up to like 0.02 or 0.03 but

245
00:09:17,491 --> 00:09:21,090
that's completely irrelevant because
alcohol doesn't have much of a

246
00:09:21,091 --> 00:09:22,130
physiological effect.

247
00:09:22,131 --> 00:09:22,231
It,

248
00:09:22,231 --> 00:09:23,190
those low doses.

249
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:27,990
And so while this is one of the things
that made me absolutely despise ethics

250
00:09:27,991 --> 00:09:28,411
committees,

251
00:09:28,411 --> 00:09:31,620
and I believe that the proliferation of
ethics committees is one of the reasons

252
00:09:31,621 --> 00:09:34,380
that university research
human research is,

253
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,190
is,

254
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:36,240
is doing badly.

255
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:38,280
Psychological research is doing badly.

256
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:39,420
There's a variety of reasons,

257
00:09:39,421 --> 00:09:40,530
but that's certainly one of them.

258
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,480
So I was interested,

259
00:09:42,481 --> 00:09:43,830
sorry this is a very long answer,

260
00:09:43,831 --> 00:09:45,900
but I was interested
in personality as well.

261
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:46,320
You know,

262
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:50,700
because I was a clinical psychologist
and I'd read Freud and Jung and Adler and

263
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:53,010
all the great clinicians
of the 20th century.

264
00:09:53,011 --> 00:09:55,950
And when I went to Harvard I was offered,

265
00:09:56,610 --> 00:09:56,851
you know,

266
00:09:56,851 --> 00:09:57,061
I,

267
00:09:57,061 --> 00:09:57,420
you know,

268
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:58,800
when you're a new faculty member,

269
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:02,610
there's usually a set course
that they require you to teach.

270
00:10:02,611 --> 00:10:03,810
That's one of the core courses.

271
00:10:03,811 --> 00:10:05,760
And then you have some freedom
with your other courses.

272
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:10,860
And so I said I'd teach personality and
then I got more and more and we were

273
00:10:10,861 --> 00:10:14,580
looking at personality models
with the alcoholism research too.

274
00:10:14,581 --> 00:10:15,211
At that point,

275
00:10:15,211 --> 00:10:17,160
the big five was starting
to establish itself.

276
00:10:17,161 --> 00:10:19,980
And I wasn't much of an admirer
of the big five because I like,

277
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:22,740
while I like theories as
well as empirical research.

278
00:10:22,741 --> 00:10:24,000
And I thought the big five,

279
00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:25,650
while there was just no theory at all,

280
00:10:25,651 --> 00:10:27,300
it was just brute force empiricism,

281
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:29,820
but well,

282
00:10:29,821 --> 00:10:31,140
but you know,

283
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:33,240
that data eventually became convincing.

284
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:35,070
And as I got more and more interested in,

285
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:36,413
um,

286
00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:39,210
in personality,

287
00:10:39,211 --> 00:10:44,010
I got more and more interested in the
use of personality and other psychometric

288
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:48,900
technologies to predict things
like academic and creative success.

289
00:10:48,901 --> 00:10:51,570
You see it at McGill,

290
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:55,860
my Bob and I and a variety
of other people were using,

291
00:10:56,310 --> 00:10:57,000
um,

292
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,780
psychological tests of various sorts
to predict things like alcoholism and

293
00:11:00,781 --> 00:11:02,050
antisocial personality.

294
00:11:02,051 --> 00:11:05,760
So we could use the big five
and neuropsychological tests,

295
00:11:05,761 --> 00:11:07,830
tests of Dorsolateral prefrontal function,

296
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,330
at least in principle,

297
00:11:09,331 --> 00:11:12,840
to predict to some degree who might
be susceptible to the development of

298
00:11:12,841 --> 00:11:14,070
antisocial personality.

299
00:11:14,071 --> 00:11:15,000
And then when I went to Harvard,

300
00:11:15,001 --> 00:11:15,301
I thought,

301
00:11:15,301 --> 00:11:15,481
well,

302
00:11:15,481 --> 00:11:15,661
hey,

303
00:11:15,661 --> 00:11:20,661
maybe we could use those tests to predict
who was going to be good at things as

304
00:11:20,671 --> 00:11:22,080
well as who was going to be bad.

305
00:11:22,081 --> 00:11:22,321
You know,

306
00:11:22,321 --> 00:11:24,570
the people who are creative
are the people who were,

307
00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:25,530
um,

308
00:11:25,530 --> 00:11:26,490
academically,

309
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:27,210
um,

310
00:11:27,210 --> 00:11:30,570
outstanding or people who did well
as managers and administrators and

311
00:11:30,571 --> 00:11:33,730
corporations might do well
on personality tests and,

312
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:38,580
and neuropsychological tests that assess
dorsolateral prefrontal functions.

313
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:39,810
That's higher order cognition.

314
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:44,370
So we started to put together test
batteries that assessed that and that was

315
00:11:44,371 --> 00:11:45,360
fascinating research.

316
00:11:45,361 --> 00:11:46,740
I did that with Daniel Higgins,

317
00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:47,880
who's the partner,

318
00:11:47,881 --> 00:11:51,210
my partner in the development of the
self authoring program and understand

319
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:55,090
myself that things that he's labored
for years on before they really became

320
00:11:55,091 --> 00:11:55,924
successful.

321
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:57,093
Um,

322
00:11:57,430 --> 00:11:59,200
and he wrote a bang up thesis.

323
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:00,093
Um,

324
00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:02,770
I think it was the best
thing ever written on this,

325
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,360
on the topic of intelligence.

326
00:12:04,650 --> 00:12:05,180
And,

327
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:07,480
and launched that he
started working on in,

328
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:08,680
in 1993,

329
00:12:08,681 --> 00:12:10,960
which is about the same time
that the bell curve came out.

330
00:12:10,961 --> 00:12:14,950
And so his research actually became
row relatively politically contentious,

331
00:12:14,951 --> 00:12:19,951
even though all we were trying to do
was trying to determine what attributes

332
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:26,070
predicted success among creative people
and among managers and administrators

333
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,313
and,

334
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:28,870
and academia and so forth,

335
00:12:28,871 --> 00:12:30,190
pure empirical research.

336
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:31,381
But it became real,

337
00:12:31,381 --> 00:12:33,840
very rapidly politicized anyways.

338
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:36,310
So I just got more and more
interested in psychometrics,

339
00:12:36,311 --> 00:12:40,450
partly because I realized way back
when in 1993 that almost nothing that's

340
00:12:40,451 --> 00:12:42,610
psychologists measured was actually real.

341
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:44,770
And so we were interested
in what was real.

342
00:12:44,771 --> 00:12:47,020
And Daniel is an engineer trained at Mit.

343
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:48,550
And so he was very,

344
00:12:48,551 --> 00:12:50,560
very method method,

345
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:52,030
a methodical person.

346
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:55,210
And he didn't like to move
ahead with his research at all,

347
00:12:55,211 --> 00:12:59,890
unless he had nailed absolutely everything
down in a way that only an engineer

348
00:12:59,891 --> 00:13:01,330
and a software coder would.

349
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:06,340
And so we started working on personality
models and I've been doing that and

350
00:13:06,341 --> 00:13:08,800
concentrating on that more
specifically ever since,

351
00:13:08,801 --> 00:13:12,130
as well as writing the more theoretical
material that was associated,

352
00:13:12,131 --> 00:13:14,110
say with 12 rules for
life in maps of meaning.
