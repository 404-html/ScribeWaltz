1
00:00:07,690 --> 00:00:08,523
You know,

2
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:11,970
there were elements in my
character that are optimistic.

3
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:12,570
You know,

4
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:12,990
I've,

5
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:13,501
I've looked,

6
00:00:13,501 --> 00:00:14,161
for example,

7
00:00:14,161 --> 00:00:18,390
I worked for a UN committee on the
relationship between economic development,

8
00:00:18,391 --> 00:00:21,960
sustainability and I found out a variety
of things that were very optimistic.

9
00:00:21,961 --> 00:00:22,800
Like the sock that,

10
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:23,551
you know,

11
00:00:23,551 --> 00:00:28,551
the UN set out to have poverty between
2000 and 2015 worldwide and actually hit

12
00:00:29,221 --> 00:00:31,020
that by about 2010 right?

13
00:00:31,021 --> 00:00:35,100
So we're in that period of the fastest
transformation of the bottom strata of

14
00:00:35,101 --> 00:00:38,940
the world's population into something
approximating middleclass that's ever

15
00:00:38,941 --> 00:00:39,690
occurred.

16
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:43,530
And there's all these great technological
innovations on the horizon and it

17
00:00:43,531 --> 00:00:47,220
looks to me like things could go
extraordinarily well if we were careful,

18
00:00:47,221 --> 00:00:50,580
but I'm not optimistic
and maybe that's me.

19
00:00:50,581 --> 00:00:54,660
I'm pessimistic because I also see that
there's five or six things happening,

20
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:58,950
all of which appear at the level of
catastrophe that are all happening at the

21
00:00:58,951 --> 00:00:59,580
same time.

22
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:03,720
And so one of the things that I'd like
to ask you is like what do you see

23
00:01:03,721 --> 00:01:05,850
happening in the next 10 years in,

24
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:07,770
in the universities are
in culture at large.

25
00:01:07,771 --> 00:01:08,551
And I mean,

26
00:01:08,551 --> 00:01:11,730
you just put forward a proposal for the
universities for the treatment of women,

27
00:01:11,731 --> 00:01:12,990
which I think is very interesting.

28
00:01:12,991 --> 00:01:15,300
One because women do have a
different timeframe than men,

29
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:18,870
but like what the hell is
the proper way forward?

30
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:22,620
I've been encouraging young men to tell
the truth and to take responsibility and

31
00:01:22,621 --> 00:01:24,600
there's a huge market for that message.

32
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:25,200
But,

33
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,940
but I'm not convinced by any stretch
of the imagination that it's enough.

34
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:33,720
What like when you look forward
and you try to be optimistic,

35
00:01:33,721 --> 00:01:34,890
what the hell do you see?

36
00:01:35,410 --> 00:01:35,801
Well,

37
00:01:35,801 --> 00:01:38,500
and in the largest scale,

38
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:39,410
um,

39
00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:44,410
I'm concerned about the future of
Western culture because as a student of

40
00:01:44,861 --> 00:01:45,341
history,

41
00:01:45,341 --> 00:01:45,520
I,

42
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,560
it looks too much to me like ancient Rome.

43
00:01:47,561 --> 00:01:47,741
Okay.

44
00:01:47,741 --> 00:01:49,570
Would you became overexpanded,

45
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:50,141
uh,

46
00:01:50,141 --> 00:01:50,974
which became an,

47
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,000
was at the mercy of,

48
00:01:52,001 --> 00:01:52,181
of,

49
00:01:52,181 --> 00:01:53,380
of bureaucratic,

50
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:54,273
um,

51
00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:55,360
um,

52
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:55,511
uh,

53
00:01:55,511 --> 00:01:56,230
the creep.

54
00:01:56,230 --> 00:01:56,870
Okay.

55
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:57,190
Yeah.

56
00:01:57,190 --> 00:02:00,430
And I can imagine one of
this yesterday and it,

57
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:00,830
and,

58
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:01,400
um,

59
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:04,060
and Roman identity eventually,

60
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:04,570
um,

61
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:05,770
got blur and okay.

62
00:02:05,771 --> 00:02:06,051
In the,

63
00:02:06,051 --> 00:02:08,860
in its incorporation of so
many different cultures,

64
00:02:08,861 --> 00:02:11,290
which at first seemed like a
healthy kind of multiculturalism,

65
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:14,330
but eventually overexpand and
simply collapse of its own way.

66
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:15,700
I and I,

67
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,800
so I am concerned about the,

68
00:02:17,801 --> 00:02:18,010
you know,

69
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:21,190
whether Western culture
is in a rapid decline.

70
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:25,450
I think it would be very easy because
we are so interconnected and so

71
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:27,160
overcomplex very easy,

72
00:02:27,161 --> 00:02:27,311
you know,

73
00:02:27,311 --> 00:02:31,200
to bring it to ruin it would only
take one major natural disaster.

74
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,500
We're going to do that.

75
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:34,000
But the University of themselves,

76
00:02:34,001 --> 00:02:34,151
I mean,

77
00:02:34,151 --> 00:02:34,811
I think people are,

78
00:02:34,811 --> 00:02:36,940
are all of a sudden in the United States,

79
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:38,410
much more,

80
00:02:38,411 --> 00:02:38,950
um,

81
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:42,390
attentive to issues of political
correctness because of the,

82
00:02:42,391 --> 00:02:43,540
the riots at Berkeley,

83
00:02:43,541 --> 00:02:44,374
which was the,

84
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:44,770
you know,

85
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:46,420
which was the capital of free speech.

86
00:02:46,421 --> 00:02:46,700
I mean,

87
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:47,491
I don't mean the,

88
00:02:47,491 --> 00:02:49,740
the free speech movement
happened in the spring,

89
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:50,300
uh,

90
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:54,370
before I entered college in 1964 to
one of the great principles and the,

91
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:56,350
in the inspirational
stories in my entire life.

92
00:02:56,351 --> 00:02:57,340
Mario Savio was,

93
00:02:57,341 --> 00:02:57,580
you know,

94
00:02:57,580 --> 00:02:57,761
uh,

95
00:02:57,761 --> 00:02:58,180
you know,

96
00:02:58,180 --> 00:02:59,013
and uh,

97
00:02:59,310 --> 00:02:59,460
uh,

98
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:00,081
assertion of,

99
00:03:00,081 --> 00:03:00,271
of,

100
00:03:00,271 --> 00:03:00,911
of the,

101
00:03:00,911 --> 00:03:02,560
of the supremacy of,

102
00:03:02,561 --> 00:03:02,771
you know,

103
00:03:02,771 --> 00:03:04,110
free thought and free speech.

104
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,250
And I,

105
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:06,940
I though I think then perhaps,

106
00:03:06,941 --> 00:03:07,331
you know,

107
00:03:07,331 --> 00:03:07,541
we,

108
00:03:07,541 --> 00:03:09,240
we might just have turned a corner,

109
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,270
but it's going to take a very,

110
00:03:10,271 --> 00:03:12,250
very long time for the
university to be reformed.

111
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:15,220
I feel that the cafeteria menu,

112
00:03:15,221 --> 00:03:15,610
okay.

113
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:15,941
Of,

114
00:03:15,941 --> 00:03:16,241
of,

115
00:03:16,241 --> 00:03:16,420
um,

116
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:18,260
the university curriculum
has to be abandoned.

117
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:20,890
We must return to historical,

118
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:21,490
uh,

119
00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:26,230
courses that begin in the earliest
period in the Stone Age and antiquity in

120
00:03:26,231 --> 00:03:27,310
order to give perspective,

121
00:03:27,311 --> 00:03:27,461
you know,

122
00:03:27,461 --> 00:03:27,671
to,

123
00:03:27,671 --> 00:03:28,000
to our,

124
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,430
to our present doing analysis
of our president and culture.

125
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:31,510
I want,

126
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:32,140
um,

127
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:32,530
uh,

128
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:32,951
50,

129
00:03:32,951 --> 00:03:35,830
50 to 75% of college administrators fired.

130
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:36,430
Okay.

131
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:38,440
And the money be transferred over okay.

132
00:03:38,441 --> 00:03:39,050
To,

133
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:39,430
um,

134
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:39,641
to,

135
00:03:39,641 --> 00:03:42,550
to faculty and to libraries
and two into two instruction.

136
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:43,300
Okay.

137
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:43,790
Um,

138
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:44,650
I think that,

139
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:45,250
um,

140
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:45,790
you know,

141
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:49,570
obviously the way things are being
people are being trained right now,

142
00:03:49,571 --> 00:03:51,070
including at the public school level.

143
00:03:51,071 --> 00:03:51,710
Okay.

144
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:54,040
Is I think that might think the
public school level has gone to hell.

145
00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:54,400
And when my,

146
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:54,571
when,

147
00:03:54,571 --> 00:03:54,741
when,

148
00:03:54,741 --> 00:03:54,911
when,

149
00:03:54,911 --> 00:03:55,780
when my mother came,

150
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:56,141
you know,

151
00:03:56,141 --> 00:03:57,910
came to Dennis states at age of six,

152
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:58,510
they,

153
00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:02,660
there were the old public school system
was so very strict and therefore she has

154
00:04:02,661 --> 00:04:04,420
an excellent education,

155
00:04:04,421 --> 00:04:05,110
you know,

156
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:05,800
and um,

157
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:05,951
you know,

158
00:04:05,951 --> 00:04:07,370
did got all A's in,

159
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:07,991
in her,

160
00:04:07,991 --> 00:04:08,620
in her,

161
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:10,600
even though she started
on not speaking English,

162
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:12,010
spoke without an accent,

163
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:12,520
etc.

164
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:12,671
Okay.

165
00:04:12,671 --> 00:04:13,360
So,

166
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,320
so today this,

167
00:04:14,321 --> 00:04:18,000
this kind of feel good public
school education at which is,

168
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:20,800
which is a form of ideology
in inductor nation right now.

169
00:04:20,801 --> 00:04:22,600
So it's all about the no bullying.

170
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:22,871
Okay.

171
00:04:22,871 --> 00:04:23,780
And it's not about,

172
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:27,080
yes.

173
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:27,470
Yeah.

174
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:27,970
So I mean,

175
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:29,620
I can tell them in my own students,

176
00:04:29,621 --> 00:04:29,801
I mean,

177
00:04:29,801 --> 00:04:31,180
I've been teaching for 46 years,

178
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:35,380
so I can tell this slow degradation
of public school education.

179
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:35,511
Okay.

180
00:04:35,511 --> 00:04:37,380
Until they get to the point now that the,

181
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:41,460
that the students have absolutely no
sense of world geography of world history

182
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:42,650
and they know absolutely nothing.

183
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:46,240
They don't know anything
about wars and the reality,

184
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:49,570
the barbaric reality of
most of human history.

185
00:04:49,571 --> 00:04:49,830
Okay.

186
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:50,670
And one of,

187
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:52,653
yeah,

188
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:54,700
what a fantastic culture we live in.

189
00:04:54,701 --> 00:04:55,650
And so now it doesn't,

190
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:57,820
identity politics itself
has just got to stop.

191
00:04:57,821 --> 00:04:58,031
I mean,

192
00:04:58,031 --> 00:04:59,440
they was important once.

193
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:00,303
Okay.

194
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:04,450
I was a rebel against the wasp hegemony.

195
00:05:04,450 --> 00:05:04,880
Okay.

196
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,820
White Anglo Saxon Protestant of Germany.

197
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,290
In American culture it was,

198
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:09,610
it was suffocating.

199
00:05:09,611 --> 00:05:14,611
I was raised in the 1950s or they went
when wasps controlled corporations and,

200
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:15,770
and,

201
00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:17,890
and education and politics and so on.

202
00:05:17,891 --> 00:05:20,440
And so identity politics
was necessary once.

203
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,040
Okay.

204
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:21,580
To do it.

205
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:23,530
We asserted gay rights.

206
00:05:23,531 --> 00:05:23,831
Okay.

207
00:05:23,831 --> 00:05:24,141
And he was,

208
00:05:24,141 --> 00:05:26,480
it was stonewall rebellion
of 1969 we have sir,

209
00:05:26,481 --> 00:05:27,340
we asserted,

210
00:05:27,341 --> 00:05:27,611
okay.

211
00:05:27,611 --> 00:05:29,260
The women's rights with the,

212
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:29,650
with the,

213
00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:32,800
with the rebirth of second wave
feminism in the late 1960s okay.

214
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:34,240
But there's endless,

215
00:05:34,241 --> 00:05:34,451
okay.

216
00:05:34,451 --> 00:05:35,550
Preoccupation with,

217
00:05:35,551 --> 00:05:37,510
with a fragmented identity,

218
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:39,370
we must return to the authentic,

219
00:05:39,371 --> 00:05:39,740
that six,

220
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:40,450
his vision,

221
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:45,100
which is about identity coming from a
consciousness which transcends gender,

222
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:48,250
which transcends all
these divisions of race.

223
00:05:48,251 --> 00:05:49,084
Okay.

224
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:50,030
Ethnicity.

225
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:50,860
Okay.

226
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:52,180
Consciousness itself.

227
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:52,630
Okay.

228
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:53,010
All right.

229
00:05:53,010 --> 00:05:55,320
Then there's no sense of that any longer.

230
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:58,040
That's what the 1960
sauce I see of that is

231
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:00,680
a complete abandonment of
personal responsibility.

232
00:06:00,681 --> 00:06:01,040
Yes.

233
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:03,170
Because like that consciousness,

234
00:06:03,171 --> 00:06:04,280
I think symbolically,

235
00:06:04,281 --> 00:06:06,770
and I got a lot of this from
yoga and also for Merrick noise.

236
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:08,810
I mean that's the great logos of the West,

237
00:06:08,811 --> 00:06:09,021
right?

238
00:06:09,021 --> 00:06:10,550
That's the transcendent principle,

239
00:06:10,551 --> 00:06:11,240
which is,

240
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:15,140
is respect for the primacy
of individual consciousness.

241
00:06:15,141 --> 00:06:18,290
And what goes along with that
primarily isn't individual rights,

242
00:06:18,291 --> 00:06:19,670
although that's built into it.

243
00:06:19,671 --> 00:06:22,970
I mean that's the reason we have
individual rights is for respect for that.

244
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:26,660
But the responsibility that comes along
with being an individual instead of the

245
00:06:26,661 --> 00:06:27,800
member of some group,

246
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:29,420
especially a victimized group,

247
00:06:29,421 --> 00:06:31,000
which is like the usher.

248
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:34,790
I wrote an article with one of my students
who had toured the mass grave sites

249
00:06:34,791 --> 00:06:36,770
and in the former Yugoslavia,

250
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:36,981
you know,

251
00:06:36,981 --> 00:06:37,820
and have been explored,

252
00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:39,140
exposed to that sort of thing.

253
00:06:39,141 --> 00:06:43,880
And one of the things that our research
indicated was that the best predictor of

254
00:06:43,881 --> 00:06:48,230
genocide is a victimization on the part
of the group that produces the genocide.

255
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:48,501
Right.

256
00:06:48,501 --> 00:06:50,870
A sense of an accelerated
sense of victimization.

257
00:06:50,871 --> 00:06:51,291
And then it's,

258
00:06:51,291 --> 00:06:53,120
well we get them before they get us.

259
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:57,260
So when everyone's being taught now that
they're a victim and then no one seems

260
00:06:57,261 --> 00:06:58,310
to have any sense that,

261
00:06:58,580 --> 00:06:58,821
you know,

262
00:06:58,821 --> 00:07:03,260
that's part of the essential tragedy of
being that life is suffering and that

263
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,520
and that and that and that,

264
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:08,030
and that the world rests on
a foundation of suffering.

265
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:12,140
It's nothing to take personally
and something to take
responsibility for instead

266
00:07:12,141 --> 00:07:13,330
of blaming and,

267
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:17,060
and resentment and all of the things that
have polluted our universities and our

268
00:07:17,061 --> 00:07:17,510
culture.
