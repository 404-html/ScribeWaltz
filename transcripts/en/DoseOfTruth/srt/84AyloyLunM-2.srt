00:00:07,270 --> 00:00:11,710
I was speaking with Jonathan Patios this
morning cause he's staying in the same

2
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:13,420
airbnb is my wife and I,

3
00:00:13,421 --> 00:00:18,421
and he suggested that I talk to you
about my experiences with media over the

4
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:20,201
last year.

5
00:00:20,201 --> 00:00:20,621
And I thought,

6
00:00:20,621 --> 00:00:22,510
well that's a,

7
00:00:22,511 --> 00:00:23,800
that's something I know about.

8
00:00:23,801 --> 00:00:27,730
So it's always good when you're talking
to people to talk to some talk about

9
00:00:27,731 --> 00:00:28,840
something that you know about.

10
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:31,870
That's actually a really
good tip for public speaking,

11
00:00:31,871 --> 00:00:32,141
right?

12
00:00:32,141 --> 00:00:32,974
If,

13
00:00:33,010 --> 00:00:34,120
well it's really true.

14
00:00:34,121 --> 00:00:37,450
You have to remember that you should
know about three times as much about the

15
00:00:37,451 --> 00:00:38,284
topic as,

16
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:43,050
as you need to talk about the topic and
then you have places you can go and you

17
00:00:43,051 --> 00:00:43,181
know,

18
00:00:43,181 --> 00:00:46,330
you can wander round a little
bit and be a little spontaneous.

19
00:00:46,331 --> 00:00:47,410
So that's really useful.

20
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:48,700
And um,

21
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:52,840
but then I also thought that makes sense
because nobody knows anything about the

22
00:00:52,841 --> 00:00:55,360
situation with regards to the media now.

23
00:00:55,390 --> 00:00:57,430
And so we're all feeling our way.

24
00:00:57,730 --> 00:01:01,810
And so because the technological
transformations are so rapid and you know

25
00:01:01,811 --> 00:01:04,720
they're going to come one after
the other in the next 10 years,

26
00:01:04,721 --> 00:01:08,500
I don't think we can even imagine what's
coming down the pipes and we're all

27
00:01:08,501 --> 00:01:09,670
struggling to keep up.

28
00:01:09,671 --> 00:01:10,451
And you know,

29
00:01:10,451 --> 00:01:14,260
we don't even know how much of the
current state of more radical political

30
00:01:14,261 --> 00:01:17,710
polarization is actually a secondary
consequence of technological

31
00:01:17,711 --> 00:01:19,660
transformations that we don't understand.

32
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:21,340
Because I was thinking today about,

33
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:22,331
you know,

34
00:01:22,331 --> 00:01:26,170
about Facebook and about Twitter and
about youtube and about the idea that

35
00:01:26,171 --> 00:01:27,550
people are in an echo chamber.

36
00:01:27,551 --> 00:01:29,800
And I'm not really sure
that's the right metaphor.

37
00:01:29,801 --> 00:01:32,800
I think we might be in an amplifier
rather than an echo chamber.

38
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:33,541
You know,

39
00:01:33,541 --> 00:01:37,220
and I've thought for a
long time that when I'm,

40
00:01:37,221 --> 00:01:39,370
when I'm thinking about the
effect of the individual,

41
00:01:39,371 --> 00:01:43,250
I read something that Solzhenitsyn said
at one point and I think he was citing

42
00:01:43,251 --> 00:01:43,780
a,

43
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:47,890
an ancient Christian theologian who
defined the universe has a place that's

44
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:52,690
whose circumference was nowhere
and who's centered was everywhere.

45
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:54,160
And I really liked that idea.

46
00:01:54,161 --> 00:01:54,290
It's,

47
00:01:54,290 --> 00:01:57,730
and I think it's actually relatively
true from a technical perspective,

48
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,320
like from a physical perspective,

49
00:01:59,321 --> 00:02:04,321
but social needs and pointed out that
each of us was to be regarded as a center

50
00:02:04,361 --> 00:02:05,310
of the cosmos.

51
00:02:05,650 --> 00:02:08,170
And that we have the power
that's associated with that.

52
00:02:08,171 --> 00:02:10,810
And I've thought about that a lot because
there's something about it that's,

53
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:16,260
that's it's either obviously true or
it's true enough so that we all acted out

54
00:02:16,361 --> 00:02:19,540
when we interact with each other because
we treat each other like conscious

55
00:02:19,541 --> 00:02:21,370
beings who have a destiny in him,

56
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:25,060
who have choices and who make choices
that are important and who make choices

57
00:02:25,061 --> 00:02:27,820
that can be good or bad
or even good and evil.

58
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:29,140
We all act like that.

59
00:02:29,141 --> 00:02:29,431
So we,

60
00:02:29,431 --> 00:02:30,400
we act that out.

61
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:35,320
And I was thinking that you can
think of network models in that way.

62
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,060
You know,

63
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:36,640
um,

64
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:40,780
you can think of human beings as like
9 billion dots in a row and there's no

65
00:02:40,781 --> 00:02:42,100
connections between the dots.

66
00:02:42,101 --> 00:02:45,580
And then you're sort of like a dust mote
in the wind and who the hell cares what

67
00:02:45,581 --> 00:02:46,510
you think anyways,

68
00:02:46,511 --> 00:02:48,400
and you don't have any impact on things.

69
00:02:48,401 --> 00:02:52,960
Or you can recognize that you're at the
center of a network system and that you

70
00:02:52,961 --> 00:02:53,111
know,

71
00:02:53,111 --> 00:02:57,100
you know a thousand people or you will
in your lifetime or perhaps more than a

72
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:57,491
thousand people,

73
00:02:57,491 --> 00:02:58,900
and then they know a thousand.

74
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:03,250
So you're separated by one person
from 1,000,002 people from a billion.

75
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:05,350
And that's a much better way to think.

76
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:10,240
And we are seriously networked together
and we're networked together more now

77
00:03:10,241 --> 00:03:11,290
than we ever have been.

78
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:16,291
And so one of the things that that might
mean is that the choices you make are

79
00:03:16,481 --> 00:03:21,130
amplified and distributed not only
far faster than they ever have been,

80
00:03:21,131 --> 00:03:22,630
but with far more impact.
