Australia is holding a plebiscite
on whether to legalize gay marriage.

3
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:18,510
I'm against the yes campaign,

4
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:21,090
but only because it's
backed by Cultural Marxists.

5
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:23,730
I'm curious to hear your
views on gay marriage.

6
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:30,501
Well,

7
00:00:30,501 --> 00:00:34,430
I would be against the two of it was
backed by Cultural Marxists because it

8
00:00:34,431 --> 00:00:35,570
isn't clear to me that,

9
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:36,993
um,

10
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:40,370
it will satisfy the ever increasing.

11
00:00:40,970 --> 00:00:41,710
What would you call it?

12
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:44,630
Demand for an assault on
traditional modes of being.

13
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:45,771
Now,

14
00:00:45,771 --> 00:00:47,630
with regards to gay marriage specifically,

15
00:00:47,631 --> 00:00:49,760
that's a really tough one for me because,

16
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:50,781
you know,

17
00:00:50,781 --> 00:00:52,760
I can imagine

18
00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:04,060
I can't do anything really other
than spout platitudes about it.

19
00:01:04,061 --> 00:01:05,530
I suppose unfortunately,

20
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:06,753
you know,

21
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:07,713
if,

22
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:10,840
if the marital vows are taken seriously,

23
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:16,350
then it seems to me that it's a means
whereby gay people could be integrated

24
00:01:18,041 --> 00:01:21,610
more thoroughly into standard society
and that's probably a good thing.

25
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:24,100
And maybe that would decrease promiscuity,

26
00:01:24,101 --> 00:01:25,900
which is a public health problem.

27
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:26,770
Um,

28
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:29,350
although obviously that's
not limited to gay people.

29
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:30,310
Um,

30
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:33,310
although gay men tend to be
more promiscuous than average,

31
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,890
probably because there's no women to
bind them with regards to their sexual

32
00:01:38,891 --> 00:01:39,724
activity.

33
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:40,743
Um,

34
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:44,401
the problem is,

35
00:01:44,401 --> 00:01:47,010
is that it does seem to
me to be part of a wedge.

36
00:01:47,011 --> 00:01:51,330
And it isn't obvious to me that legalizing
gay marriage has done anything to

37
00:01:51,331 --> 00:01:55,890
decrease the demand that the radical
left neo Marxists types are placing on

38
00:01:55,891 --> 00:01:57,000
traditional society.

39
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:58,253
So,

40
00:01:58,620 --> 00:01:59,453
um,

41
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:02,350
those are my views.

42
00:02:02,351 --> 00:02:03,520
I know they're confused,

43
00:02:03,610 --> 00:02:04,210
you know,

44
00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:09,210
because I'm in favor of extending the
bounds of traditional relationships to

45
00:02:10,811 --> 00:02:13,930
people who wouldn't be involved in
a traditional longterm relationship.

46
00:02:13,931 --> 00:02:18,931
But I'm concerned about the undermining
of traditional modes of being,

47
00:02:19,931 --> 00:02:20,770
including marriage,

48
00:02:20,771 --> 00:02:21,580
which you know,

49
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:22,590
has technically and,

50
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:26,020
and historically been a union
between a man and a woman,

51
00:02:26,021 --> 00:02:29,400
fundamentally for the purpose
of raising children in a,

52
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:30,700
in a stable and,

53
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:31,210
and,

54
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:32,043
uh,

55
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:32,850
um,

56
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:34,750
an optimal and stable environment.

57
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:35,441
So,

58
00:02:35,441 --> 00:02:40,120
and marriage has already taken a fair
bit of damage over the last few decades.

59
00:02:40,121 --> 00:02:40,540
You know,

60
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:43,360
poor people are increasingly
less likely to be married,

61
00:02:43,361 --> 00:02:45,760
and that's really not good for
them as far as I'm concerned.
