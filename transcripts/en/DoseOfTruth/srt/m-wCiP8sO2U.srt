1
00:00:07,130 --> 00:00:12,130
I think what people have to adapt to the
fact that systems chronically collapse

2
00:00:12,831 --> 00:00:14,480
at every level of severity.

3
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:16,540
And that's life life.

4
00:00:16,541 --> 00:00:20,930
He is the sequential collapse of
systems at each level of resolution.

5
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:22,850
And so systems last for a while,

6
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:24,270
great depend on,

7
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:25,873
but then they,

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,020
then they collapse.

9
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:31,880
And you need to be the sort of thing that
can transform itself during a collapse

10
00:00:31,881 --> 00:00:33,740
so that you're there for the next system.

11
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:36,230
And that's a death and
rebirth essentially.

12
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:41,150
That's your death and rebirth so
that the old you that was in the old

13
00:00:41,151 --> 00:00:44,660
environment gets punished out of existence
and that hurts like hell and gets you

14
00:00:44,661 --> 00:00:49,520
all depressed and anxious and then
you're in a state of crisis and as things

15
00:00:49,521 --> 00:00:53,390
fall apart and then up comes a new you
and there's a new environment and away

16
00:00:53,391 --> 00:00:54,224
way you go.

17
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:56,090
And so people have to be,

18
00:00:57,590 --> 00:01:02,590
people have to be disciplined enough to
be part of a system and flexible enough

19
00:01:02,601 --> 00:01:04,160
to transform when the system fails.

20
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:10,390
And that's basically the two fundamental,

21
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:13,600
uh,

22
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,670
w adaptive elements that
enable success of living.

23
00:01:16,970 --> 00:01:21,970
And people have known that in one
form or another for in story form for

24
00:01:22,011 --> 00:01:23,090
thousands of years.
