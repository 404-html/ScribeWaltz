1
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:19,180
Here's an idea that's expressed.

2
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:24,750
Christian symbolism was an idea that
Christ was crucified before he headed to

3
00:00:27,881 --> 00:00:28,690
hell.

4
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:31,570
The heroin hell and rise
to mythological idea.

5
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:35,050
It's an article and liberal
idea as far as I'm aware.

6
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:36,520
But there's an idea there.

7
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:38,020
If you want to move out,

8
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:40,000
you have to go down first,

9
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:41,140
then you kind of know this,

10
00:00:41,141 --> 00:00:41,391
right?

11
00:00:41,391 --> 00:00:43,390
Because most of the things that
you've learned in your life,

12
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:45,220
you've learned the hard way.

13
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:49,720
And so most any hole that will
increase in wisdom tends to come back,

14
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:51,190
a sacrificial cost,

15
00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:51,770
right?

16
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:56,770
You have to die and there's
an intermediary period of
chaos and horror and then

17
00:00:57,311 --> 00:00:58,390
maybe come out of that.

18
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:02,070
You're wiser and more work together,

19
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:03,240
but you paid for it.

20
00:01:03,970 --> 00:01:04,870
And so

21
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,670
one of the things that's being the
consequence of that process for me is,

22
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:10,150
you know,

23
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:11,140
I've looked into these,

24
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:13,110
this motivation for atrocity,

25
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:16,240
and I told you what I concluded
you could make about what you want,

26
00:01:16,241 --> 00:01:16,990
but it's all from them.

27
00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:18,760
Something very positive for me,

28
00:01:18,850 --> 00:01:21,010
which was to shed light on something else,

29
00:01:21,011 --> 00:01:21,844
which is,

30
00:01:21,970 --> 00:01:23,370
well let's say you can need,

31
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:25,750
and this has to do with the
solution of the problem.

32
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:29,460
Let's say you can detail problem
and so I need the problem.

33
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:30,041
If it's,

34
00:01:30,041 --> 00:01:31,560
if it's detailed though property,

35
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,690
then there's a solution
that emerges from it.

36
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:36,600
If you could identify the
nature of the true level,

37
00:01:36,601 --> 00:01:39,640
it's then you clarify the
nature of its officers,

38
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:44,530
which is whatever is good and then you
didn't perhaps pursue that and perhaps

39
00:01:44,531 --> 00:01:46,180
that's how you can spray the malevolence.

40
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:47,540
Whatever good is,

41
00:01:47,541 --> 00:01:48,610
is not what he,

42
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:50,010
and it's the opposite of that.

43
00:01:50,011 --> 00:01:51,010
And some would say,

44
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:56,130
well what do you do instead of
trading trending down half of cane?

45
00:01:58,970 --> 00:02:00,490
And that's answer that is

46
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:07,270
you don't look for the insufficiency
of the world in the structure.

47
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:12,430
You look for the insufficiency of
destruction of the world in you.

48
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:16,120
If things aren't going
well enough for you,

49
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:19,440
then you have some work to
do and you might pay Paul.

50
00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:23,050
That's a hell of a
thing because the world,

51
00:02:23,051 --> 00:02:23,884
there's a lot to it.

52
00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:27,010
It's a railing against
you in some finding ways.

53
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:29,290
And there's no doubt that that's the case.

54
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:31,000
You've got your options.

55
00:02:31,001 --> 00:02:36,001
You can either pass your catastrophe at
the feet of God and become bitter and

56
00:02:36,191 --> 00:02:39,160
cruel and resentful and
works as a consequence.

57
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:41,150
Or you can take it upon yourself,

58
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:45,580
prove what you improve and also assume
that the same time that there's enough to

59
00:02:45,581 --> 00:02:46,980
you that you can actually bench.

60
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:51,370
And it's the same with
regards to malevolence itself.

61
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:54,740
You can look for that upside for yourself
and there's evidence for no time of

62
00:02:54,741 --> 00:02:55,540
yourself.

63
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:58,900
And then you can go after those people
that you regard as particularly in the

64
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:01,300
straight in your world up that way.

65
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:03,220
But that's how insurance develop.

66
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:04,190
No,

67
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:05,890
and there's a better idea,

68
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:10,920
which is my one love to yourself first
and see just how much of that constraint

69
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:15,280
excite yourself start before you start
worrying about how much of that younger,

70
00:03:15,281 --> 00:03:16,540
the constraint it under people.

71
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:21,450
And so that's why you need to send
your house in perfect order before he

72
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:22,750
criticized the world.

73
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:23,880
Because all of that,

74
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:29,890
and then this one seems to go down
the pathway that cane go gone,

75
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:32,590
and the people still go down constantly.

76
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:35,920
There might making
everything worse for them,

77
00:03:35,921 --> 00:03:36,880
for their families,

78
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:37,991
for the community,

79
00:03:37,991 --> 00:03:38,980
for the world.

80
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:42,190
You have the alternative of
taking all of that onto yourself,

81
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:43,320
right,

82
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,650
and so that's fine.

83
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:49,420
In our most profound
transformative stories,

84
00:03:49,421 --> 00:03:52,920
let's say the person who revives me,

85
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:57,370
the world is the person who voluntarily
accepts their own vulnerability.

86
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,970
That's what's symbolized
by the crucifixion.

87
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:05,590
That's why that symbol as
Gregory Poole for 2000 years,

88
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:11,400
since the proper pathway is to take on
your mortality is your responsibility.

89
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,280
And the second is to,

90
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:17,470
okay,

91
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:18,303
seven,

92
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:23,430
how would I put this

93
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:37,450
to notice that the temptation that's
laid down by the spirit of malevolence is

94
00:04:37,451 --> 00:04:42,451
it temptation that you confront that
you have to take responsibility for and

95
00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:44,400
that you have to attain victory over?

96
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:46,620
It's a psychological drama,

97
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:50,940
and that's the story that sits at the
bottom of her culture with its emphasis on

98
00:04:50,941 --> 00:04:52,410
the dignity of the individual,

99
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:55,350
isn't the suffering of the individual.

100
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:56,253
It's divine.

101
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:58,480
It's not the malevolence
of the individual,

102
00:04:58,520 --> 00:04:59,353
it's divine.

103
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:03,480
It's the capacity of the individual
in principle to accept both of those,

104
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:04,980
to work for the remediation.

105
00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:10,110
And that's the story that allows us our
natural rights and our innate dignity

106
00:05:10,111 --> 00:05:13,380
and the responsibility that we have
taught ourselves into our families,

107
00:05:13,381 --> 00:05:14,250
into the community.

108
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:19,560
And it's the acting out of that story
that produces individuals who are healthy

109
00:05:19,561 --> 00:05:20,370
and thriving.

110
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:24,630
Families that work and survive in
communities that are integral and don't

111
00:05:24,631 --> 00:05:26,860
degenerate into something
resembling health.

112
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:29,370
And it's important as Carl,

113
00:05:29,371 --> 00:05:34,371
you don't point it out for us to wake
up because we're so powerful now.

114
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:39,420
We need to wake up and you need to
understand what it is that we'd be doing

115
00:05:39,421 --> 00:05:41,580
right and wrong for all of this time.

116
00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:46,770
I have to implement that as consciously
and clearheaded Layton intentively

117
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:52,000
properly as I possibly can
in our individual lives and
to see what great things

118
00:05:52,561 --> 00:05:55,620
might happen as a
consequence if you did some

119
00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:02,690
[inaudible].
