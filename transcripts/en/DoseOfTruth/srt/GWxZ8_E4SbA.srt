1
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:08,580
In Dante's inferno.

2
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:10,230
I think I mentioned this at one point.

3
00:00:10,231 --> 00:00:11,670
So Dante's inferno,

4
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:13,080
it's a very interesting story.

5
00:00:13,081 --> 00:00:14,550
It's a descent into hell a,

6
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:19,080
and it's actually one of the places
that we sort of derive the popular

7
00:00:19,081 --> 00:00:21,680
conception of hell was
partly based on Dante's,

8
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:23,400
on Dante's imagination,

9
00:00:23,401 --> 00:00:24,234
on his work.

10
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:28,320
And what Dante was trying to do was to
discover the hierarchical structure of

11
00:00:28,321 --> 00:00:29,154
evil.

12
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:29,641
And you know,

13
00:00:29,641 --> 00:00:31,710
you might think there is a
hierarchical structure of good,

14
00:00:31,711 --> 00:00:33,360
some things are better than other things,

15
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:35,670
but there's also a
hierarchical structure of evil.

16
00:00:35,671 --> 00:00:39,360
Some evils are greater than other
evils and he put betrayal in the,

17
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:40,080
in the,

18
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:41,460
in the lowest part of Hail,

19
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:42,151
right?

20
00:00:42,151 --> 00:00:43,560
So if you were betraying people,

21
00:00:43,561 --> 00:00:45,450
you were right beside Satan himself.

22
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:46,530
And so,

23
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:47,730
and I think that's good.

24
00:00:47,731 --> 00:00:48,750
That's very smart.

25
00:00:48,751 --> 00:00:50,580
While Dante was a genius after all,

26
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:51,793
um,

27
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:54,960
and I think the reason
for that is that you see,

28
00:00:54,961 --> 00:00:56,130
if someone trusts you,

29
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:58,950
they're laying their
vulnerability open to you.

30
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:00,390
Now they might just be naive,

31
00:01:00,391 --> 00:01:00,841
let's say.

32
00:01:00,841 --> 00:01:01,680
And that's,

33
00:01:01,681 --> 00:01:04,560
we won't think about that
because you're just a child.

34
00:01:04,561 --> 00:01:05,394
If you're naive,

35
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:06,750
you can still be betrayed.

36
00:01:06,751 --> 00:01:08,460
But if you're an adult and you trust,

37
00:01:08,461 --> 00:01:09,600
it's often because you,

38
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,010
if you're an actual adult,

39
00:01:11,011 --> 00:01:15,150
it's you willingly open yourself
up knowing that you could be hurt.

40
00:01:15,151 --> 00:01:15,510
Right?

41
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:16,710
Cause you're not naive anymore.

42
00:01:16,711 --> 00:01:21,711
So you decide to trust and you see y'all
opened myself up and I know that I'm

43
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:23,970
laying myself open to you.

44
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:27,390
If you choose to use that power and
then that's a good thing to know.

45
00:01:27,391 --> 00:01:27,601
You know,

46
00:01:27,601 --> 00:01:29,400
if you've been hurt as a child,

47
00:01:29,401 --> 00:01:30,630
it hurt as a naive person.

48
00:01:30,631 --> 00:01:31,051
You might say,

49
00:01:31,051 --> 00:01:32,550
well why should I ever trust again?

50
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:33,930
Which is a really good question.

51
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:36,090
And the answer is the reason you trust,

52
00:01:36,091 --> 00:01:36,361
again,

53
00:01:36,361 --> 00:01:38,550
once you're an adult is
because you're courageous.

54
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:39,711
You're,

55
00:01:39,711 --> 00:01:40,470
you're courageous.

56
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:42,480
It's an act of courage to trust.

57
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:46,440
And the reason it's useful is
because if you trust someone,

58
00:01:46,441 --> 00:01:51,441
you opened the door to reciprocity and
negotiation and cooperation and you

59
00:01:52,171 --> 00:01:54,810
entice the best part
of the person forward.

60
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:56,160
And so it's a,

61
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:57,480
it's a courageous act.

62
00:01:58,110 --> 00:01:59,670
But then if you be traced someone,

63
00:01:59,671 --> 00:02:02,880
then what you've done is you've
taken the best part of them,

64
00:02:02,881 --> 00:02:05,430
which is the part that
will courageously trust,

65
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:05,870
you know,

66
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:06,840
with open eyes.

67
00:02:06,841 --> 00:02:07,560
Right?

68
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,540
And you've stuck a dagger in that.

69
00:02:09,541 --> 00:02:13,050
And so you've purposefully
damaged the best part of the,

70
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:16,350
and so that's why it's
such a egregious fault.

71
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:17,160
And,

72
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:20,700
and it's often people don't recover
from that sort of playing it.

73
00:02:20,701 --> 00:02:21,180
You,

74
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:22,720
if you'd be traced someone badly enough,

75
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:23,430
you can,

76
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:24,360
you can damage them.

77
00:02:24,361 --> 00:02:27,480
Like you can give them post traumatic
stress disorder if you really,

78
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:29,040
if you really put your mind to it,

79
00:02:29,041 --> 00:02:29,641
and you know,

80
00:02:29,641 --> 00:02:32,010
that's not just a psychological disorder.

81
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:33,910
If you have posttraumatic stress disorder,

82
00:02:33,911 --> 00:02:38,520
it produces permanent neurological
alterations that make you more neurotic,

83
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,290
more sensitive to negative emotion,

84
00:02:40,291 --> 00:02:41,760
really for the rest of your life.

85
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:42,421
Like you can,

86
00:02:42,421 --> 00:02:45,690
you can recover from it to some degree,

87
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:49,740
but stress will tend to
re instantiate that PTSD.

88
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:51,220
So you,

89
00:02:51,221 --> 00:02:54,060
you hurt someone and
it's not merely cycle.

90
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,920
Not that psychological is merely,

91
00:02:55,921 --> 00:02:57,600
but it's not merely psychological,

92
00:02:57,601 --> 00:02:57,811
right?

93
00:02:57,811 --> 00:02:58,260
It's,

94
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:00,600
it's fundamental physiological damage.
