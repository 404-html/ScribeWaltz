1
00:00:06,370 --> 00:00:09,940
So that's what a human being is
like in terms of his or her output.

2
00:00:09,970 --> 00:00:11,080
And so what you see,

3
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:15,190
if you look at a sensory homonculus
it's quite similar except the feet are

4
00:00:15,191 --> 00:00:15,521
bigger.

5
00:00:15,521 --> 00:00:16,810
The Genitalia or bigger,

6
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:19,360
logically they don't
have much motor utility,

7
00:00:19,361 --> 00:00:20,920
but they have a lot of sensory utility.

8
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:23,080
But the rest of it's quite similar.

9
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:23,943
So there's,

10
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:24,221
you know,

11
00:00:24,221 --> 00:00:26,320
the motor and the sensory
homonculus are quite similar.

12
00:00:26,321 --> 00:00:29,500
But I'm going to talk about the motor
homonculus because it's sort of the action

13
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:30,640
representation.

14
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:30,851
While,

15
00:00:30,851 --> 00:00:32,230
so what are human beings like?

16
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:33,693
Well,

17
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:36,400
we're all hands.

18
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:37,563
That's the first thing,

19
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:38,111
you know.

20
00:00:38,111 --> 00:00:38,740
And if you,

21
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:39,580
if you do that,

22
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:40,870
there's no,

23
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:42,640
it's unbelievably high resolution.

24
00:00:42,641 --> 00:00:43,540
Your fingertips and,

25
00:00:43,541 --> 00:00:43,870
and,

26
00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:44,620
and the,

27
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:45,160
and the,

28
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:45,881
that sensory.

29
00:00:45,881 --> 00:00:48,640
But we can manipulate
our hands like crazy.

30
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:50,770
Like they're unbelievably articulated,

31
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:51,580
right?

32
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:53,920
And that's the thing that makes
us able to change the world.

33
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,750
It makes us what dolphins aren't.

34
00:00:56,440 --> 00:01:00,820
And so a huge part of our brain is devoted
towards being able to move our hands.

35
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:03,010
That enables us to take things apart,

36
00:01:03,190 --> 00:01:04,023
put them together.

37
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:07,450
And then once we learned to take
things apart and put them together,

38
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:09,370
we can talk about how we do that.

39
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:10,930
And that's a lot of what we're doing.

40
00:01:10,931 --> 00:01:12,910
And that's the hands and
the mouth and the tongue.

41
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:13,773
Roughly speaking.

42
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:17,440
Here's how I took
something to apart chaos.

43
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:19,120
Here's what I made out of it.

44
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:19,870
Order,

45
00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:20,950
here's how I did it.

46
00:01:21,610 --> 00:01:24,280
And then you receive that
and you're happy about it.

47
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:25,900
And then you can do the same thing.

48
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:27,370
And that's imitation.

49
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:29,260
It's facilitated by language.

50
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:29,891
It's like,

51
00:01:29,891 --> 00:01:31,330
here's what I did with my body.

52
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:34,060
I'm propagating the cross space.

53
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:35,890
You're taking it,

54
00:01:35,891 --> 00:01:37,270
mapping it onto your body.

55
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:38,680
Now you can do the same thing.

56
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:39,161
Yeah,

57
00:01:39,161 --> 00:01:39,850
and that's,

58
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:40,061
you know,

59
00:01:40,061 --> 00:01:42,610
it might be simple like this
is how you pick up a rock,

60
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,020
but it might be complicated.

61
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:47,170
Like here's how you go
after the dragon of chaos.

62
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:47,861
Right?

63
00:01:47,861 --> 00:01:51,340
And so that's it sort of
maps onto that hierarchy.

64
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:54,970
This thing we've talked
about in some detail,

65
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:56,313
this,

66
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:58,030
when you're telling a story to people,

67
00:01:58,031 --> 00:01:59,710
when you're informing
them about something,

68
00:01:59,711 --> 00:02:02,500
you can talk to them at a
very high level of resolution,

69
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:03,850
which you do with your child.

70
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:06,400
Here's how you slice up some Broccoli,

71
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:07,510
right?

72
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:09,400
But then you move up
the obstruction and say,

73
00:02:09,401 --> 00:02:12,130
here's how you act like a civilized
person at the dinner table.

74
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:13,091
Right?

75
00:02:13,091 --> 00:02:14,770
And that's part of being a good person.

76
00:02:14,771 --> 00:02:16,240
So you can tell stories about,

77
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:17,980
I just went and saw Logan,

78
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:19,630
which I really liked by the way,

79
00:02:19,631 --> 00:02:20,411
it's super violent,

80
00:02:20,411 --> 00:02:21,340
but I really did like it.

81
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:22,160
Uh,

82
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:22,993
it's,

83
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:24,310
it's got a very elegant,

84
00:02:24,311 --> 00:02:25,300
mythological structure,

85
00:02:25,301 --> 00:02:26,320
which is not surprising,

86
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:27,453
but,

87
00:02:27,490 --> 00:02:27,910
um,

88
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:29,440
there's a scene in this Logan movie.

89
00:02:29,441 --> 00:02:29,790
He,

90
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:30,160
he,

91
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:30,620
he,

92
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:30,880
uh,

93
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:31,810
it's not a spoiler.

94
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:35,680
He has this child with
him who has not been,

95
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:37,900
who's been raised roughly in a laboratory,

96
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:40,420
and she has absolutely no table manners.

97
00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:44,920
And so they're sitting at a dinner with
some people that they've run into and

98
00:02:44,921 --> 00:02:46,930
she's eating like a total barbarian.

99
00:02:46,931 --> 00:02:47,351
And of course,

100
00:02:47,351 --> 00:02:48,790
everybody's eyebrows,

101
00:02:48,791 --> 00:02:49,211
her race.

102
00:02:49,211 --> 00:02:50,020
Like,

103
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:51,340
where did this person come from?

104
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:56,520
So that the fact that that high order
behavior isn't there is something that's

105
00:02:56,691 --> 00:02:58,240
acts of extraordinary interest.

106
00:02:58,241 --> 00:02:59,050
Everyone.

107
00:02:59,050 --> 00:02:59,711
And so you know,

108
00:02:59,711 --> 00:02:59,881
you,

109
00:02:59,881 --> 00:03:04,390
you teach your children micro strategies
and you teach the macro strategies and

110
00:03:04,391 --> 00:03:06,250
some of the macro strategies
you're teaching them,

111
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:09,490
you don't even understand
because you know,

112
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:13,240
you know the strategies they're built
into you because of an evolutionary

113
00:03:13,241 --> 00:03:13,721
process,

114
00:03:13,721 --> 00:03:14,554
roughly speaking.

115
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:17,740
And you say things like it doesn't
matter whether you win or lose,

116
00:03:17,741 --> 00:03:20,910
it matters how you play the game and
you don't understand what that means.

117
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:24,610
Although you know it's right and you try
to act that out for your children and

118
00:03:24,611 --> 00:03:26,860
they incorporate it in their action,

119
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:28,480
even though they can't represent it,

120
00:03:28,481 --> 00:03:33,160
they cannot come up with a
fully articulated representation
of what that means.

121
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:34,360
And so they're like children,

122
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:35,560
the Piaget and children.

123
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:40,000
Children can only play by themselves
to begin with while they're integrating

124
00:03:40,001 --> 00:03:40,990
themselves internally.

125
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:44,260
Then they start to play in
parallel with other children.

126
00:03:44,261 --> 00:03:45,094
So you'll,

127
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:46,043
you're to,

128
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:47,013
you play your game,

129
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:49,960
that child plays his or her
gape little interaction,

130
00:03:49,961 --> 00:03:51,610
but you can't unite the games.

131
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:54,100
Then you're between two and four.

132
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:56,230
You start to be able to unite the games.

133
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:58,300
And you can either do
that by acting them out.

134
00:03:58,330 --> 00:03:58,931
You can do this.

135
00:03:58,931 --> 00:04:00,010
Even with the younger child,

136
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:02,080
they can catch peekaboo very rapidly.

137
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:06,070
But once you're between two and four
and you start getting linguistic,

138
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:07,121
you could start saying,

139
00:04:07,121 --> 00:04:07,271
well,

140
00:04:07,271 --> 00:04:11,830
let's play this game and that means we're
going to unite our attention towards a

141
00:04:11,831 --> 00:04:12,760
particular goal.

142
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:17,020
We're going to unite our motor activity
and maybe cooperate and compete towards

143
00:04:17,021 --> 00:04:17,710
that goal.

144
00:04:17,710 --> 00:04:20,470
So beginning of of the social structure,

145
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:24,010
it's the beginning of the social
structure and you get really good at that

146
00:04:24,011 --> 00:04:25,090
between two and four,

147
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:27,790
but you don't necessarily
know what you're doing.

148
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:28,930
You can't say it.

149
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:32,800
So Piaget's experiments indicated
that if you take children,

150
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:35,650
maybe they've got to the point where
they can play quite a social game.

151
00:04:35,651 --> 00:04:36,850
Maybe there are five or six,

152
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:37,870
they're playing marbles.

153
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:40,060
You take them out of the game and you say,

154
00:04:40,061 --> 00:04:40,301
okay,

155
00:04:40,301 --> 00:04:42,010
tell me the rules of the game of marbles.

156
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:44,410
They give incoherent representations.

157
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:45,573
Why?

158
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:49,240
Because their behavior is more
sophisticated than their representation.

159
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:51,460
You see as soon as you understand that,

160
00:04:51,461 --> 00:04:54,790
that is a wild thing to understand
because it answers the question.

161
00:04:54,791 --> 00:04:55,624
For example,

162
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:59,410
how can you have dreams that
tells you things you don't know?

163
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:00,701
You think,

164
00:05:00,701 --> 00:05:00,851
well,

165
00:05:00,851 --> 00:05:02,410
how the hell can that possibly be?

166
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:04,300
You're coming up with the damn dream.

167
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:06,820
How can the dream tell
you things you don't know?

168
00:05:06,821 --> 00:05:08,320
Or analogously.

169
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:12,460
How can people tell stories that contain
information that they don't understand

170
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:16,120
and answer is the information
is coded in our behavior.

171
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:16,841
Okay,

172
00:05:16,841 --> 00:05:18,700
so we'll go back to a chimpanzee troop.

173
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:21,760
All the chimpanzees in the troop?

174
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:22,600
No,

175
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,070
the dominance hierarchy structure.

176
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:28,300
But if you take a chimpanzee
out from the troop and say,

177
00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:30,370
what's the dominant structure?

178
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:34,060
The chimpanzee is going to do
whatever a chimpanzee does,

179
00:05:34,061 --> 00:05:38,110
it's not going to have a
little conversation with
you about the nature of the

180
00:05:38,111 --> 00:05:38,950
dominance hierarchy.

181
00:05:38,951 --> 00:05:43,510
So it can act out its knowledge and it
might even be able to represent it an

182
00:05:43,511 --> 00:05:44,344
image,

183
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,710
but it can't articulate it.

184
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:48,851
Well,

185
00:05:48,851 --> 00:05:50,170
why would we be any different?

186
00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:51,730
We aren't obviously,

187
00:05:51,731 --> 00:05:53,860
because we're more complex
than we understand.

188
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:57,740
So the fact that we're more complex
than we understand means that we contain

189
00:05:57,741 --> 00:05:59,960
information that we cannot articulate.

190
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:01,850
Why can't that reveal itself?

191
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:02,810
It does all the time.

192
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:04,580
You have a revelation.

193
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:06,253
Aha,

194
00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:07,603
I get it.

195
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:08,061
Well,

196
00:06:08,061 --> 00:06:08,894
what is that?

197
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:09,600
It's you.

198
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,820
Maybe you're in psychotherapy,

199
00:06:10,821 --> 00:06:12,740
and we talk about some
things about your past,

200
00:06:12,741 --> 00:06:13,071
and we say,

201
00:06:13,071 --> 00:06:13,221
well,

202
00:06:13,221 --> 00:06:13,791
this happened.

203
00:06:13,791 --> 00:06:14,451
Then this happened,

204
00:06:14,451 --> 00:06:15,284
then this happened.

205
00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:15,651
We say,

206
00:06:15,651 --> 00:06:15,891
look,

207
00:06:15,891 --> 00:06:16,640
there's a pattern.

208
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:17,473
Wow.

209
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:18,740
And it's overwhelming.

210
00:06:18,741 --> 00:06:22,250
It's like now there's a concordance
between your knowledge and the things that

211
00:06:22,251 --> 00:06:23,090
you're acting out,

212
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:25,070
and that's what comes as a revelation.

213
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:28,040
So one of the things
that happens in exodus,

214
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:30,140
Moses is leading his
people through the deserts.

215
00:06:30,141 --> 00:06:31,850
Classic you shaped story.

216
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,410
They're in a tyranny to begin with,

217
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:34,010
right?

218
00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:34,843
So that's the,

219
00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:36,530
that's the insufficient present.

220
00:06:36,531 --> 00:06:37,790
That's the old order.

221
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:39,740
Then they crossed the water,

222
00:06:39,890 --> 00:06:40,940
the destructive water.

223
00:06:40,941 --> 00:06:41,660
That's chaos.

224
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:42,470
Like the flood.

225
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:45,640
Then they're out in the desert
wandering without direction.

226
00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:47,030
They start worshiping idols,

227
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,860
they're wandering without direction.

228
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:52,400
And then Moses goes up on the mountain,

229
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:54,171
which is,

230
00:06:54,171 --> 00:06:54,561
by the way,

231
00:06:54,561 --> 00:06:55,580
what happens in Logan,

232
00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:57,410
just because if you're going to go see it,

233
00:06:57,411 --> 00:06:59,930
you might as well know that because
it's a journey up the mountain.

234
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:01,263
Um,

235
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:04,070
he goes up the mountain and he
gets rules revealed to them.

236
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:04,731
Well,

237
00:07:04,731 --> 00:07:06,110
the way the story is structured,

238
00:07:06,111 --> 00:07:11,111
it's extraordinarily interesting because
Moses takes us people away from this

239
00:07:11,151 --> 00:07:11,660
tyranny,

240
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:12,710
tyrannical structure,

241
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:17,980
but they don't go from tyranny to
paradise to the promise land in one move.

242
00:07:18,531 --> 00:07:19,520
That isn't how it works.

243
00:07:19,521 --> 00:07:20,330
They have to,

244
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:24,230
they go from a tyranny to absolute chaos
where everyone is fighting and killing

245
00:07:24,231 --> 00:07:27,830
each other and having a terrible
time of it and half starving and,

246
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,170
and having to pass through the Red Sea.

247
00:07:30,171 --> 00:07:30,860
Like it's,

248
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:35,750
they go from tyranny to catastrophe
before they go to higher order.

249
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:38,480
And Moses doesn't even make it
to the place of higher order.

250
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:40,640
He dies before he gets there.

251
00:07:40,641 --> 00:07:41,001
So it's,

252
00:07:41,001 --> 00:07:42,240
it's quite the catastrophe.

253
00:07:42,241 --> 00:07:45,740
And the Israelites are all confused when
they're out in the desert because even

254
00:07:45,741 --> 00:07:47,510
though they were in a
tyranny and they were slaves,

255
00:07:47,511 --> 00:07:49,550
now they're nowhere and
they don't know anything.

256
00:07:49,551 --> 00:07:50,510
It's not good.

257
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:54,950
And so a lot of them actually
start thinking about how
good the damn tyranny was

258
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:56,840
compared to wandering
around in the desert,

259
00:07:56,841 --> 00:07:58,820
which is exactly what
happened to the Soviet Union,

260
00:07:58,850 --> 00:07:59,120
right?

261
00:07:59,120 --> 00:07:59,631
In Russia.

262
00:07:59,631 --> 00:08:03,170
Now there's huge nostalgia
for the Stalinist era.

263
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:05,150
So these stories,

264
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:05,370
they,

265
00:08:05,370 --> 00:08:06,530
they're always true.

266
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,640
They're always happening.

267
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,410
So anyways,

268
00:08:09,411 --> 00:08:12,590
what happens to Moses is that
the story is quite interesting.

269
00:08:12,591 --> 00:08:15,500
So the Israelites start to
fight amongst themselves,

270
00:08:15,650 --> 00:08:18,920
which of course they do because
there's no higher order authority.

271
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:23,780
And so then Moses sits and judges
like literally like a judge.

272
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:27,650
He sits for hours every day and the
squabbling Israelites come up and say,

273
00:08:27,890 --> 00:08:28,400
you know,

274
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,570
he did this to me and no,

275
00:08:29,571 --> 00:08:30,590
you did this to me.

276
00:08:30,591 --> 00:08:30,860
And,

277
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:33,920
and so then Moses has to figure
out who's right and who's wrong.

278
00:08:33,921 --> 00:08:37,130
And he's doing this for like
hours and hours for days and days,

279
00:08:37,131 --> 00:08:38,060
for weeks and weeks,

280
00:08:38,061 --> 00:08:38,930
for months.

281
00:08:39,470 --> 00:08:41,300
It's like the origin
of English common law.

282
00:08:41,930 --> 00:08:44,870
It's exactly what happened with
common law because in common law,

283
00:08:44,871 --> 00:08:47,330
what happens is that
you have all the rights.

284
00:08:47,331 --> 00:08:48,080
There are,

285
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,370
if you to have a dispute,

286
00:08:49,371 --> 00:08:50,870
you go before the judiciary,

287
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:52,010
you sort out the dispute.

288
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,240
That becomes a precedent.

289
00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:53,511
Now,

290
00:08:53,511 --> 00:08:55,620
that's part of the body of laws.

291
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:58,260
The body of laws is what you act out.

292
00:08:58,290 --> 00:08:59,340
That's why it's a body.

293
00:08:59,820 --> 00:08:59,971
Well,

294
00:08:59,971 --> 00:09:01,080
that's what Moses does.

295
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:04,140
So he's sitting there making judgments.

296
00:09:04,141 --> 00:09:04,471
Very,

297
00:09:04,471 --> 00:09:06,330
very finely tuned,

298
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:08,190
discrete moral judgements.

299
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:11,730
You know how difficult that is when two
people have a dispute to try to figure

300
00:09:11,731 --> 00:09:13,110
out how to mediate between that?

301
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:14,160
You don't know who's lying,

302
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:15,390
who's telling the truth.

303
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:18,390
You don't know exactly what an
acceptable solution would be like.

304
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:20,520
It's really ridiculously hard work.

305
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:25,880
So he walks through this entire process
of continual judicial intermediation.

306
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:28,350
Then he goes up the mountain
and what does he get?

307
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,760
Tablet of rules.

308
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:30,181
Well,

309
00:09:30,181 --> 00:09:31,014
why?

310
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:31,501
Well,

311
00:09:31,501 --> 00:09:36,501
he spent his 10,000 hours investigating
the structure of morality in a practical

312
00:09:38,281 --> 00:09:38,970
way,

313
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:39,600
and it goes,

314
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,433
Bang,

315
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:42,540
this is what we've been doing.

316
00:09:42,541 --> 00:09:44,040
These are the rules.

317
00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:47,310
It's not like there's no rules
to begin with and don'ts.

318
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:49,650
Those are imposed because
that wouldn't work.

319
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,150
It doesn't work that way.

320
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:54,270
You have to take how people are,

321
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:59,070
extract out what the pattern of what
they are is reflect that back to them.

322
00:09:59,100 --> 00:09:59,580
Well that's,

323
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:01,290
that's the story of Moses and it's,

324
00:10:01,291 --> 00:10:01,740
it's,

325
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:02,460
it's a myth.

326
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:03,490
It's a metal story.

327
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:06,330
It's a story about how rules come to be.

328
00:10:06,930 --> 00:10:08,040
We act a certain way.

329
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:09,720
We have certain kinds of expectations.

330
00:10:09,721 --> 00:10:11,880
We have certain kinds
of disputes out of that,

331
00:10:11,881 --> 00:10:12,600
a pattern,

332
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:15,390
a pattern way of being emerges.

333
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:17,520
Then we map the pattern way of being.

334
00:10:17,521 --> 00:10:17,761
We say,

335
00:10:17,761 --> 00:10:18,091
well look,

336
00:10:18,091 --> 00:10:18,924
here's the rules.

337
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:22,740
There's 10 of them or however
many you want to extract.

338
00:10:22,741 --> 00:10:22,951
Right?

339
00:10:22,951 --> 00:10:23,730
I mean it's,

340
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:25,320
it's a moving target in some sense.

341
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:26,850
Don't kill other people.

342
00:10:26,851 --> 00:10:27,810
That's a bad idea.

343
00:10:28,050 --> 00:10:30,150
Don't steal what other people have,

344
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:31,590
honor your parents,

345
00:10:31,591 --> 00:10:32,101
et Cetera,

346
00:10:32,101 --> 00:10:32,581
et cetera.

347
00:10:32,581 --> 00:10:32,821
I mean,

348
00:10:32,821 --> 00:10:33,360
these are,

349
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,390
you could come up with a
different basic set of rules,

350
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:39,420
but there'd be some overlap and
those aren't bad to begin with.

351
00:10:39,421 --> 00:10:40,980
Kirsten were far more rules than that,

352
00:10:40,981 --> 00:10:42,300
but those were the central ones.

353
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:43,920
And so then he might say,

354
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:45,450
hey,

355
00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:50,450
if you took all 10 of those rules and
you tried to extract out one rule from

356
00:10:50,461 --> 00:10:51,294
them,

357
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:53,370
that would be at the top of the hierarchy,

358
00:10:53,371 --> 00:10:54,300
what would that be?

359
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:55,800
And in Western culture,

360
00:10:55,801 --> 00:10:59,400
the idea there is that do unto others
as you would have them do unto you,

361
00:10:59,401 --> 00:11:02,910
is the rule that it's the matter
rule that guides all other rules.

362
00:11:02,911 --> 00:11:04,350
Sorta like the one ring in the,

363
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:05,730
in the Lord of the rings.
