1
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:07,140
That's funny,

2
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:09,150
I was just talking to one
of my graduate students,

3
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:15,170
we'd be looking at the determinants of
male attractiveness by the personality of

4
00:00:16,171 --> 00:00:17,610
female viewers.

5
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:19,140
Okay.

6
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:22,380
And so what we found is that there
are some personality affects.

7
00:00:22,381 --> 00:00:24,210
So I'm extroverted,

8
00:00:24,211 --> 00:00:28,680
enthusiastic women tend to rate men
generally speaking as more attractive than

9
00:00:28,681 --> 00:00:29,400
introverted,

10
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:29,940
introverted,

11
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:31,260
less enthusiastic women.

12
00:00:31,261 --> 00:00:32,180
And um,

13
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:33,481
and so,

14
00:00:33,481 --> 00:00:36,000
so there are some just
straight personality effects,

15
00:00:36,001 --> 00:00:39,000
but the biggest effect by far
we found was the proclivity of,

16
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:44,560
of women in general to rape men as less
attractive as the women's Iq increased.
