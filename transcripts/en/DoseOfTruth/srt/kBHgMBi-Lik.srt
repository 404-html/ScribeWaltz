1
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:09,220
I'm beginning to sort myself out.

2
00:00:09,221 --> 00:00:10,054
Thanks to you.

3
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:11,650
While I'm very glad to hear that.

4
00:00:12,310 --> 00:00:14,260
I have a question about
scheduling your time,

5
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:20,080
trying to make a schedule in a chaotic
job with constantly changing shifts and

6
00:00:20,081 --> 00:00:24,070
out tips or should I find
a new job all together?

7
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:26,533
Well,

8
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:28,040
you know,

9
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:28,740
I don't,

10
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:32,790
I can't answer that Josh because I don't
know enough about the details of your

11
00:00:32,791 --> 00:00:33,624
life.

12
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:34,560
But what I would say,

13
00:00:34,561 --> 00:00:36,990
and maybe you've tried
this already is you know,

14
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:39,150
try to make two plants.

15
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:39,990
Okay.

16
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:40,980
Because when you're,

17
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:42,840
when you're trying to think
something like this through,

18
00:00:42,841 --> 00:00:44,730
you need to think it through in detail.

19
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:50,240
And so one plan would be how you would
conduct your life optimally and organize

20
00:00:50,881 --> 00:00:55,830
your time if you kept your current job
and you want to make that as acceptable

21
00:00:55,831 --> 00:01:00,300
and positive as possible and then make
out another plan where you shift jobs and

22
00:01:00,301 --> 00:01:01,260
you have no,

23
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:05,730
maybe a more stable working arrangement
and then think about what your life

24
00:01:05,731 --> 00:01:07,590
would be like if you had that.

25
00:01:07,591 --> 00:01:10,620
And then because you've laid
out a detailed map of both,

26
00:01:10,621 --> 00:01:12,600
you're in a much better
position to compare them.

27
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:14,063
And so,

28
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:15,253
mmm.

29
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:16,171
You know,

30
00:01:16,171 --> 00:01:18,210
you might need to talk to
somebody about that too.

31
00:01:18,211 --> 00:01:22,620
But that's what I would recommend
because it's just too complicated a job.

32
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:27,240
Like if you find that your
sleep is chronically disrupted
and you can't organize

33
00:01:27,241 --> 00:01:28,074
your life,

34
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:30,560
the fact that shift changes,

35
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:31,860
no trivial thing.

36
00:01:31,861 --> 00:01:34,560
And it can really throw your
mood regulation for a loop too.

37
00:01:34,561 --> 00:01:36,000
And I don't know if
that's happening to you.

38
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:36,330
Not,

39
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:39,960
but that's also something else that's
worth taking into consideration.

40
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:45,240
But I would say map out an alternative
reality where you don't have those

41
00:01:45,241 --> 00:01:47,550
problems and see how
much better that looks.

42
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:48,300
You know,

43
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:50,640
I presume there's some
advantages to your current job.

44
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:51,391
So,

45
00:01:51,391 --> 00:01:53,520
and it also depends on
what your options are.

46
00:01:53,521 --> 00:01:57,480
Like how hard would it be for you to find
another job and could you find a job,

47
00:01:57,481 --> 00:02:00,840
like maybe the best thing to do would
be to try to find a job that's better,

48
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:02,520
that doesn't have shifts,

49
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:03,451
you know,

50
00:02:03,451 --> 00:02:05,190
and maybe that'll take you a year or two.

51
00:02:05,191 --> 00:02:05,580
It's,

52
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:06,750
that can be very difficult.

53
00:02:06,751 --> 00:02:07,584
But you know,

54
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:11,280
a year or two is a shorter period of time.

55
00:02:11,281 --> 00:02:14,490
Often that it seems so that's
what I would recommend.

56
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:15,510
So.
