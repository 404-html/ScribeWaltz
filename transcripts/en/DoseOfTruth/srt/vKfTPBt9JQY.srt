1
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:12,183
Personality,

2
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:15,160
all your lectures are available on,

3
00:00:15,161 --> 00:00:16,010
on Youtube and,

4
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:19,930
and you can either watch them as a
whole or you can see bits and pieces.

5
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:24,400
And this is in part what has made you
world famous and Cain to tremendous

6
00:00:24,401 --> 00:00:25,234
support.

7
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:26,560
And those videos,

8
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:31,590
they seem to be full of all sorts of
coaching advices from raising children to

9
00:00:32,681 --> 00:00:32,931
really,

10
00:00:32,931 --> 00:00:36,580
really relationship advice is being
a good person and facing all sorts of

11
00:00:36,581 --> 00:00:37,414
challenges.

12
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:40,270
Can you talk a little bit
about these two courses?

13
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:45,790
A little bit about the maps of meaning
course is based on a book I wrote,

14
00:00:45,791 --> 00:00:48,520
which was my first book
called maps of meaning,

15
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:52,780
which is coming out in
audio form on June 12th.

16
00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:54,730
It's a very difficult book,

17
00:00:54,910 --> 00:00:55,541
I would say.

18
00:00:55,541 --> 00:00:58,330
I wrote it not so much to communicate,

19
00:00:58,480 --> 00:00:59,920
let's say with the general public,

20
00:00:59,950 --> 00:01:02,440
but to solve a,

21
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:05,740
to address and attempt to
solve a very complex problem.

22
00:01:05,741 --> 00:01:10,741
And I was curious about why the world
had found itself in a stalemate after

23
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:20,160
World War II with the Soviet bloc and
the western block say arming themselves

24
00:01:23,411 --> 00:01:24,850
ever more insanely,

25
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:26,613
um,

26
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,680
in this ideological deadlock.

27
00:01:28,690 --> 00:01:33,690
And I was curious about why the
belief systems that we were each,

28
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:37,690
that each side was putting forward,

29
00:01:37,691 --> 00:01:42,691
we're so seemed so important that it
was worth risking the world itself to

30
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:44,803
support them.

31
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:50,700
And so maps of meaning is an inquiry into
the purpose of belief systems and more

32
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:54,100
than that it goes down to the individual.

33
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:54,761
Yes.

34
00:01:54,761 --> 00:01:55,750
Well that's the thing.

35
00:01:55,751 --> 00:01:56,584
Is that

36
00:01:58,350 --> 00:01:58,690
what,

37
00:01:58,690 --> 00:01:59,320
what I,

38
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,490
what I came to understand,

39
00:02:00,491 --> 00:02:02,710
I think was that the,

40
00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:04,600
the proper way forward,

41
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:10,000
the proper way of conceptualizing the
world is one that's individual centered

42
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:10,481
now.

43
00:02:10,481 --> 00:02:14,920
And I was curious about that because
of course the Soviet view was a

44
00:02:14,921 --> 00:02:19,921
collectivist view and you can make a
strong case for a collectivist view and it

45
00:02:20,861 --> 00:02:22,510
might be that either view,

46
00:02:22,511 --> 00:02:26,230
the individualist view or the collective
view is arbitrary in some sense.

47
00:02:26,231 --> 00:02:29,740
But I don't believe that the view that
privileges the individual over the state

48
00:02:29,741 --> 00:02:30,580
is arbitrary.

49
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:33,430
I think that it's correct and correct.

50
00:02:33,431 --> 00:02:37,750
Meaning that if you act it out in the
world at the individual level or the

51
00:02:37,751 --> 00:02:40,390
family level or the or the societal level,

52
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:45,900
that it produces societies that are
functional and healthy and productive and

53
00:02:48,431 --> 00:02:51,730
safe and secure and free
in the medium to longterm.

54
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:52,623
I think that it's,

55
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:57,630
and then I tried to lay out
the psychological reasons
for the development of the

56
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:03,010
idea of sovereign individual and to
show that that was grounded in more than

57
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:05,440
arbitrary ideology.

58
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:08,020
And so maps of meaning the course,

59
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:10,630
which that's been a very popular course.

60
00:03:10,631 --> 00:03:13,930
I taught that at Harvard for six years
and then at the University of Toronto

61
00:03:13,931 --> 00:03:14,561
ever since.

62
00:03:14,561 --> 00:03:19,420
And it's generally regarded as a
course that changes people's lives.

63
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:20,950
So many of your students say that.

64
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:21,341
Yes,

65
00:03:21,341 --> 00:03:21,930
it's very,

66
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:23,330
it's very common response.

67
00:03:23,331 --> 00:03:24,130
And so why,

68
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:25,600
why do you think that is?

69
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:29,230
How has it changed the students?

70
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:30,783
Well,

71
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:35,523
we have a,

72
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:38,950
we have a lot of explicit
thoughts that we can articulate,

73
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:40,330
but they're grounded in,

74
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:42,400
in other forms of thinking.

75
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:47,170
They're grounded in images and
artistic expression and narratives.

76
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:52,350
So we're fundamentally grounded in the
world inside stories and maps of meaning

77
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:57,400
is an attempt to lay out the
structure of those stories and to say,

78
00:03:57,401 --> 00:03:57,850
look,

79
00:03:57,850 --> 00:03:59,680
here's how the world is composed.

80
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:01,840
It's composed of chaos and order,

81
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,850
which is a strange way of looking at it.

82
00:04:03,851 --> 00:04:05,380
And on top of that,

83
00:04:05,381 --> 00:04:06,214
there's a,

84
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:11,520
an ethical struggle which
has been formulated most
typically as a battle between

85
00:04:13,301 --> 00:04:13,901
good and evil.

86
00:04:13,901 --> 00:04:17,590
And I think that that's the right way
of looking at the world is that human

87
00:04:17,591 --> 00:04:20,950
beings are engaged in this struggle
between good and evil on a background of

88
00:04:20,951 --> 00:04:21,850
chaos and order.

89
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:27,420
And maps of meaning is an
attempt to explain what those
categories mean in terms

90
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:32,080
that you can grip and
then and that you can use.

91
00:04:32,081 --> 00:04:32,891
Conceptually,

92
00:04:32,891 --> 00:04:34,240
I'm practically in the world.

93
00:04:34,241 --> 00:04:38,200
So it's not merely a high
level abstract discussion,

94
00:04:38,201 --> 00:04:39,520
although it is that in part,

95
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:43,480
it's an attempt to take that high
level abstract discussion and say,

96
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:44,710
here's why.

97
00:04:44,711 --> 00:04:48,700
If you know that you will be able to
operate more effectively in the world.

98
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:51,520
And I think that once you
know these categories,

99
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:53,830
you can operate more
effectively in the world.

100
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:57,070
It strengthens your resilience
in the face of catastrophe,

101
00:04:57,071 --> 00:04:57,904
for example.

102
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,750
It's encouraging it.

103
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:04,960
It helps reestablish the dignity of the
individual and to describe why that's a

104
00:05:06,131 --> 00:05:09,130
real thing and the most real thing even.

105
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:14,490
And so it's very salutary for people
because everyone doubts the utility.

106
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:17,440
People doubt their own value.

107
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:20,620
That's probably the most
precise way of putting it.

108
00:05:20,621 --> 00:05:23,980
And there are reasons that you
shouldn't doubt your value.

109
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,150
They're deep reasons.

110
00:05:25,151 --> 00:05:26,890
And so maps of meaning lays that out.

111
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:28,870
It was those one thing that

112
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:31,190
grabbed me.

113
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:31,780
He will talk.

114
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:32,481
Talking about what,

115
00:05:32,481 --> 00:05:34,110
what sort of push when you want to be,

116
00:05:34,111 --> 00:05:34,340
when,

117
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:34,990
uh,

118
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:36,230
when you went in the face of,

119
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:37,870
of maybe a death in the family.

120
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:38,920
Um,

121
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,780
can you elaborate on one of the things?

122
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:41,200
Well,

123
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:41,620
you know,

124
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:42,453
many

125
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:45,340
people,

126
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:49,030
it's not easy for people to determine
what their goals should be in our culture

127
00:05:49,031 --> 00:05:50,200
because our culture is,

128
00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:53,260
I would say materialistic and,

129
00:05:53,410 --> 00:05:55,060
and there's some positive
things about that,

130
00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:58,730
but so much in its ethical orientation.

131
00:05:58,730 --> 00:05:59,570
And so we think,

132
00:05:59,571 --> 00:05:59,751
well,

133
00:05:59,751 --> 00:06:02,180
people should strive to be happy.

134
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:05,630
And I think that that's a weak aim.

135
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:08,410
Not that there's anything
wrong with being happy if,

136
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,410
if it happens,

137
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:09,861
great,

138
00:06:09,861 --> 00:06:11,870
but it's a side effect of something else.

139
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:12,800
I see.

140
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,390
It's not a goal in and of itself.

141
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:20,040
The a better goal is to be courageous
and resilient and strong and one of the,

142
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:25,520
but that's a taboo today so much it's
because people don't understand it well.

143
00:06:25,521 --> 00:06:29,180
Like I've told my students that they
should try to beat the strongest person at

144
00:06:29,181 --> 00:06:30,350
their father's funeral.

145
00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:31,400
That's a,

146
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:36,400
because you are going to face tremendous
adversity in your life and you need to

147
00:06:36,981 --> 00:06:41,960
think through what sort of person you
want to be under conditions of adversity

148
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:46,040
and a funeral is a very good example
of that because it's a catastrophe for

149
00:06:46,041 --> 00:06:51,041
everyone involved and someone has to
bear the responsibility to navigate the,

150
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:56,000
the ship of the family through
the storms of the death.

151
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:59,600
And if you think about a
person that can do that,

152
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:04,960
obviously such a person is admirable and
there's every reason to set your goal

153
00:07:05,571 --> 00:07:07,760
as the development of
an admirable character.

154
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,560
Something else we don't
talk about anymore.

155
00:07:09,561 --> 00:07:13,400
It's as if the whole idea of admirable
character has been dispensed with,

156
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,890
and I think that's
associated with the idea,

157
00:07:15,891 --> 00:07:18,980
at least in part of the
[inaudible] patriarchy,

158
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:19,641
you know,

159
00:07:19,641 --> 00:07:22,670
if our culture is nothing
but a tyrannical patriarchy,

160
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:24,950
which it is most decidedly not,

161
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:30,610
then anyone who takes forthright action
in that structure is nothing but a

162
00:07:30,621 --> 00:07:31,760
patriarchal tyrant.

163
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,340
It's like none of that is reasonable.

164
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:36,020
So this is a really negative,

165
00:07:36,021 --> 00:07:36,830
not active,

166
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:38,300
this whole patriarchy idea.

167
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:39,410
It's a terrible narrative.

168
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:40,400
It,

169
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,650
and I think the purpose
of the narrative is,

170
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:47,450
is fundamentally to blur the distinction
between competence and power.
