1
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:11,550
That was my next point is obviously
those letters are on the intranet.

2
00:00:11,551 --> 00:00:16,551
So I was able to read them that various
professors and a certain um,

3
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:18,010
faculty,
um,

4
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,650
had signed.
And

5
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:25,200
because you're tenured in many ways
that's a,

6
00:00:25,201 --> 00:00:29,850
that's a very strong safety net.
But do you ever have those moments where

7
00:00:29,851 --> 00:00:32,370
you really feel like they are,
that you,

8
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:37,830
that there is a very strategic attempt
to demonize you and to isolate you in

9
00:00:37,831 --> 00:00:42,540
the university as much as possible
almost to the point that you would,

10
00:00:42,541 --> 00:00:45,710
God forbid it feel like you needed to
leave or resign?

11
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:49,170
Well,
I think that my job actually was in

12
00:00:49,171 --> 00:00:54,171
danger for about three months in,
in the year ago when all of this broken,

13
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,940
the diversity didn't really know what to
do.

14
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,290
I think that they got themselves
together by December and then I went

15
00:01:01,291 --> 00:01:03,990
back teaching in January and that went
very well.

16
00:01:03,991 --> 00:01:06,930
I've had zero negative interactions with
students.

17
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:11,490
None and no negative interactions with
faculty members or administrators for

18
00:01:11,491 --> 00:01:13,800
that matter?
Like not personally.

19
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:16,740
I think that there's a coterie of
people,

20
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:20,310
um,
the women and Gender Studies Institute,

21
00:01:20,311 --> 00:01:22,800
for example,
in and of course all the people whose

22
00:01:22,801 --> 00:01:25,150
disciplines I've vilified.
Yeah.

23
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:28,890
And rightly so in my estimation because
I don't regard them as disciplines.

24
00:01:28,891 --> 00:01:32,610
There are pseudo disciplines and they're
corrupting the university and more than

25
00:01:32,611 --> 00:01:36,210
the university.
So I feel no compunctions whatsoever

26
00:01:36,211 --> 00:01:38,610
about what I've said about those
disciplines.

27
00:01:38,611 --> 00:01:40,170
I think there,
I don't,

28
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:42,960
it's,
I would be hard pressed to say anything

29
00:01:42,961 --> 00:01:44,400
good about the whatsoever.

30
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:46,350
Um,
and of course,

31
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:50,670
and I've,
I've really gone after the Ontario

32
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:52,410
Institute of Studies of Education.
I think I've referred to it repeatedly

33
00:01:52,411 --> 00:01:55,410
as a rat's nest central,
which I really believe,

34
00:01:55,411 --> 00:01:58,020
I think it's an unbelievably dangerous
organization.

35
00:01:58,021 --> 00:02:01,890
And so it's not surprising that people
are,

36
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:05,250
especially the people who were
associated with those areas are not

37
00:02:05,251 --> 00:02:06,960
happy about me,
but,

38
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:09,090
um,
that's okay.

39
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,940
They can be unhappy about me.
That's not a problem.

40
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:12,843
Um,
yeah,

41
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:17,850
I think that'll change,
but I don't think they have any ability

42
00:02:17,851 --> 00:02:22,290
whatsoever to move me from my position.
I think the faculty is,

43
00:02:22,291 --> 00:02:25,830
like a month ago,
the Faculty Association wrote a letter

44
00:02:25,831 --> 00:02:29,400
to the university condemning me because
of this website I had talked about

45
00:02:29,401 --> 00:02:30,740
making,
um,

46
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:33,280
which I'm still toying with.
I,

47
00:02:33,281 --> 00:02:36,540
I'm redesigning it to her.
I think I'm going to set it up so that

48
00:02:36,541 --> 00:02:41,541
they will identify non postmodern
courses instead of identifying

49
00:02:41,641 --> 00:02:44,700
postmodern courses.
I think that's a better tack.

50
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:47,010
And uh,
but you know,

51
00:02:47,011 --> 00:02:50,430
they,
they accused me of setting up a hate

52
00:02:50,431 --> 00:02:53,850
list of doxing and all sorts of
ridiculous things,

53
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:56,490
but it's just not getting any traction.
Serena,

54
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,353
it's,

55
00:02:57,530 --> 00:02:59,010
it was almost inevitable.
The,

56
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:02,260
you know,
as you became more popular in your

57
00:03:02,261 --> 00:03:04,480
videos are being watched by millions and
your reach,

58
00:03:04,481 --> 00:03:09,400
and they're scaremongering tactics
haven't worked that they would actually

59
00:03:09,401 --> 00:03:12,520
resort to some more desperate measures
to vilify you.

60
00:03:12,521 --> 00:03:15,210
And I think the latest thing they found
was this website that you're planning.
