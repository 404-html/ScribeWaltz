1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:00,601
Hello,

2
00:00:00,601 --> 00:00:01,440
Dr. Peterson.

3
00:00:01,441 --> 00:00:03,300
I've been trying to
listen to my conscience,

4
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:05,760
but I can't tell the
difference between fear,

5
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:07,950
willful blindness or genuine conscience.

6
00:00:08,190 --> 00:00:09,023
Well,

7
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:12,570
the first thing I would say about that
is it is quite clear that you are in fact

8
00:00:12,571 --> 00:00:15,930
trying to listen to your
conscience because that's
probably the first thing that

9
00:00:15,931 --> 00:00:16,830
you discover.

10
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:18,450
So that's a really good question.

11
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:19,973
Okay.

12
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:24,413
Fear,

13
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:26,130
Oh,

14
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:29,000
here's the test and you don't
want to do this stupidly.

15
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:36,210
If you think that you should do something
and you think that the reason you

16
00:00:36,211 --> 00:00:38,760
might not be doing it is
because you're afraid,

17
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:40,080
then you should do it.

18
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:42,060
Okay?

19
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:44,220
So that way you can find out if it's fear,

20
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:46,321
you know?

21
00:00:46,321 --> 00:00:47,280
I think your question is,

22
00:00:47,281 --> 00:00:47,401
well,

23
00:00:47,401 --> 00:00:50,640
how do I know my conscience isn't
just masquerading as fear saying,

24
00:00:50,641 --> 00:00:50,761
well,

25
00:00:50,761 --> 00:00:51,690
you shouldn't do that,

26
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:54,510
but it's rationalizing the real issue,

27
00:00:54,511 --> 00:00:55,950
which is you're afraid of doing that.

28
00:00:56,550 --> 00:00:57,240
Yeah.

29
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:58,073
See,

30
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:00,930
here's a reason that you
want to tell the truth.

31
00:01:01,150 --> 00:01:01,950
And I parked,

32
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:05,400
I kind of figured this out when I was
looking deeply into the Pinocchio Story.

33
00:01:05,401 --> 00:01:09,300
You know when Pinocchio as
Pinocchio strives to become real,

34
00:01:09,301 --> 00:01:09,800
he,

35
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:11,550
he has a conscience to guide him,

36
00:01:11,551 --> 00:01:12,960
but it's jimminy cricket,

37
00:01:12,961 --> 00:01:13,800
this insect.

38
00:01:13,801 --> 00:01:16,380
But Jimmy hasn't really
got very good conscience.

39
00:01:16,381 --> 00:01:17,970
He's a bit dogmatic to begin with,

40
00:01:17,971 --> 00:01:19,620
dogmatic and didn't experienced.

41
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:22,140
And so it's,

42
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:25,050
it's not like the conscience
is an unerring guide.

43
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:27,750
It's like a partner in discovery.

44
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:33,260
And as you move forward in your life
and you consult your conscience and you

45
00:01:33,841 --> 00:01:34,674
listen to it,

46
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:38,490
then it gets smarter and so to you.

47
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:40,650
But there's a code of there.

48
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:45,000
And this is why I've suggested part
of the reason why I've suggested so

49
00:01:45,001 --> 00:01:49,740
frequently in my lectures and in
my book that people try not to lie.

50
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:50,773
You see,

51
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:52,500
there are many systems,

52
00:01:52,501 --> 00:01:53,970
you have many systems within,

53
00:01:53,971 --> 00:01:54,804
let's say,

54
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:59,900
that guide you and one of those is
your capacity for rational thought.

55
00:01:59,911 --> 00:02:03,360
And then you have a variety of emotional
systems and motivational systems and

56
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:08,540
internal dramas and intuitions and bodily
sensations like lots and lots of and

57
00:02:09,721 --> 00:02:10,554
sensors,

58
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,600
lots of systems that are guiding you.

59
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:15,930
And many of them operate,

60
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:16,853
you might say,

61
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,110
unconsciously,

62
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:20,370
autonomously,

63
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:22,560
instinctively,

64
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:23,461
implicitly,

65
00:02:23,461 --> 00:02:24,294
all of that.

66
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:27,570
Now you PR nonetheless,

67
00:02:27,571 --> 00:02:30,300
you program them like
you feed them content,

68
00:02:30,301 --> 00:02:32,940
let's say just like you
feed your body nourishment,

69
00:02:32,941 --> 00:02:37,941
you feed them content and a lot of the
content that you feed them pertains

70
00:02:37,951 --> 00:02:41,850
directly to your voluntary thoughts
and speech and your actions.

71
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:44,820
And then if you
pathologize those by lying.

72
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:48,690
So if you say things that you know not
to be true or you don't say things that

73
00:02:48,691 --> 00:02:50,370
you know to be true when you need to,

74
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:51,660
which is more common.

75
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:57,270
And if you act in ways that you consider
that back act in ways you considered

76
00:02:57,271 --> 00:02:58,110
reprehensible,

77
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:03,190
then you pathologize all of those
autonomous systems that guide you.

78
00:03:03,191 --> 00:03:04,810
It's like you're programming them badly.

79
00:03:04,811 --> 00:03:08,020
You're building an AI system
inside yourself really in,

80
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:08,280
in,

81
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,910
in some sense that is what you're doing.

82
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:12,010
That has very bad,

83
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:13,810
it's very bad training data.

84
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,910
And so the output it produces will be,

85
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,500
we'll won't guide you properly.

86
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:22,920
And so you don't want to
pathologize your guidance systems.

87
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,390
It's a really bad idea.

88
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:27,610
So that's why you have to not lie.

89
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:31,540
And maybe that's also why you
have to say what you have to say.

90
00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:32,950
And you have to say it clearly as well.

91
00:03:32,951 --> 00:03:34,090
And you have to learn how to do that.

92
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:38,410
So that's one of the ways of getting
your conscience straightened out.

93
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:41,050
And then you have to have a
dialogue with your conscience.

94
00:03:41,051 --> 00:03:41,801
And you might ask,

95
00:03:41,801 --> 00:03:42,101
it's like,

96
00:03:42,101 --> 00:03:42,401
okay,

97
00:03:42,401 --> 00:03:43,930
well what should I do?

98
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:44,920
Or what should,

99
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:47,020
should I do this or should I not do this?

100
00:03:47,021 --> 00:03:48,040
So let's say you're thinking,

101
00:03:48,041 --> 00:03:49,030
should I not do this?

102
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:50,200
In the case of a temptation,

103
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:54,670
maybe you have a chance to
develop a new relationship.

104
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:55,001
You know,

105
00:03:55,001 --> 00:03:55,834
and you're,

106
00:03:56,050 --> 00:04:01,050
you're excited about it and apprehensive
about it and afraid of it and you don't

107
00:04:01,091 --> 00:04:03,520
know how to sort out all those feelings.

108
00:04:03,521 --> 00:04:06,970
And the first thing is you really
have to want to sort them out.

109
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,230
That's why you have to orient yourself
to something that's a genuine up.

110
00:04:11,231 --> 00:04:13,120
You know that the star above the horizon,

111
00:04:13,121 --> 00:04:17,980
you have to really want things to be
straight and you have to have thought that

112
00:04:17,981 --> 00:04:18,640
through.

113
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:22,270
And you have to know what it means
for things not to be straight.

114
00:04:22,271 --> 00:04:25,540
And really what it means is that you're
headed for hell in one way or another.

115
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:27,850
And if you understand that it's enough,

116
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:29,740
maybe it's enough to scare you straight.

117
00:04:29,741 --> 00:04:31,000
You really got to think that through.

118
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:34,650
Then you've got to think about how much
better it would be if you aimed up and,

119
00:04:34,651 --> 00:04:37,210
and that really has to kind
of permeate your whole being.

120
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,760
And so then you're oriented that way.

121
00:04:39,761 --> 00:04:43,090
You're oriented up and you're deciding
that it's okay to try to tell the truth

122
00:04:43,091 --> 00:04:46,570
and then you can start to rely on
this dialogue with your conscience.

123
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:51,340
But both of you have to learn and you're
going to make mistakes along the way.

124
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:53,050
You know that that's okay.

125
00:04:53,051 --> 00:04:53,561
You can say,

126
00:04:53,561 --> 00:04:53,711
well,

127
00:04:53,711 --> 00:04:55,960
I'm going to try this without
being certain that it's right.

128
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,400
You can even say,

129
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:00,790
I'm going to say this without
being certain that it's correct.

130
00:05:00,791 --> 00:05:03,220
Like if you're arguing with your
wife or your husband or your,

131
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:04,151
or your sister,

132
00:05:04,151 --> 00:05:04,984
your father,

133
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:07,630
and you have an idea about
what might be going on,

134
00:05:07,631 --> 00:05:08,470
you can say,

135
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:09,843
look,

136
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,520
here's my idea about what's going on.

137
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:13,883
Um,

138
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,780
who knows what that idea
might be contaminated with,

139
00:05:16,781 --> 00:05:20,110
like maybe I'm putting it forward just
because I'm too proud or arrogant or

140
00:05:20,111 --> 00:05:21,970
angry or fearful or whatever.

141
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:23,800
That's possible.

142
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:25,420
Let's see if we can figure that out.

143
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:31,120
But you can offer it tentatively
and both have add it.

144
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:32,770
That's what you do if it's a hypothesis,

145
00:05:32,771 --> 00:05:32,951
right?

146
00:05:32,951 --> 00:05:36,040
You both have at it and see if
it's an idea that's worthy of,

147
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:41,380
of keeping you do that with
your conscience and then
you weren't move forward.

148
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:43,460
There's this,

149
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:47,320
there's a technique and behavioral
psychology called psychotherapy called

150
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:48,610
collaborative empiricism.

151
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:50,290
So let's say that we,

152
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:53,320
you and I have been sitting down and
we decided that you're going to try

153
00:05:53,321 --> 00:05:54,910
something new this week,

154
00:05:54,911 --> 00:05:58,130
like maybe your agoraphobic and you're
having a hard time in a parking lot.

155
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:01,130
And so getting out of the car
and going to the grocery store.

156
00:06:01,131 --> 00:06:01,970
So maybe we say,

157
00:06:01,971 --> 00:06:05,720
well in to drive to the grocery store
and you just get to walk halfway to the

158
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:11,150
halfway from your car to the door and
that's good enough for like do that every

159
00:06:11,151 --> 00:06:14,330
second day for a week and then
come back and let's talk about it.

160
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:16,070
So that's collaborative empiricism,

161
00:06:16,071 --> 00:06:17,630
you're running a little experiment,

162
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:18,493
you think,

163
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:20,780
well your conscience is
guiding you towards something.

164
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:25,130
You take a tentative step in that
direction and then you check and see,

165
00:06:25,131 --> 00:06:25,401
well,

166
00:06:25,401 --> 00:06:26,000
you know,

167
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,080
did what I wanted to have
happen or occur as an outcome.

168
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:31,760
That's the crucial question.

169
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,190
And that's the crucial
question for behavioral truth,

170
00:06:34,191 --> 00:06:34,401
right?

171
00:06:34,401 --> 00:06:36,110
That's the pragmatic perspective.

172
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:41,380
Did what I want to have happen happen
as a consequence of my framework of

173
00:06:41,421 --> 00:06:43,010
interpretation and my action.

174
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:45,290
If the answer is yes,

175
00:06:45,291 --> 00:06:47,930
then I have not invalidated it.

176
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:48,650
Right?

177
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:49,010
That's,

178
00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:51,290
that's the pragmatic
philosophy in a nutshell.

179
00:06:51,291 --> 00:06:51,611
And it's,

180
00:06:51,611 --> 00:06:52,251
it's very,

181
00:06:52,251 --> 00:06:53,084
very smart.

182
00:06:58,010 --> 00:07:01,160
So you have a dialogue
with your conscience that
never ends and hopefully it

183
00:07:01,161 --> 00:07:03,710
gets wiser and you get wiser.

184
00:07:04,670 --> 00:07:05,503
And

185
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:10,760
that's the dialogue that young talked
about between the conscious and the

186
00:07:10,761 --> 00:07:11,600
unconscious,

187
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:12,703
between your,

188
00:07:14,290 --> 00:07:15,310
your fantasy life,

189
00:07:15,311 --> 00:07:20,260
say the life that sort of underneath
you as a conscious being like the life

190
00:07:20,261 --> 00:07:22,270
that's part of your biological platform,

191
00:07:22,271 --> 00:07:26,650
the biological platform that somehow
miraculously gives rise to your

192
00:07:26,651 --> 00:07:27,490
consciousness.

193
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:29,410
If a dialogue with that,

194
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,800
we're always in dialogue.

195
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:34,060
We're always in dialogue,

196
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:34,540
right,

197
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:35,373
with everything.

198
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:37,803
So

199
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:39,850
pursue that.
