1
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:12,860
You're working like mad to
get your bachelor's degree.

2
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:13,491
You know,

3
00:00:13,491 --> 00:00:15,710
when you're really excited
about the day that I do curse.

4
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:16,191
Okay,

5
00:00:16,191 --> 00:00:17,330
what happens the week after?

6
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:21,980
What happens the week after is that you're
no longer in the pursuing a bachelor

7
00:00:21,981 --> 00:00:23,090
degree universe.

8
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:28,280
You're now in the post bachelor degree
looking for a job universe and that might

9
00:00:28,281 --> 00:00:30,080
not be nearly as pleasant to place.

10
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:32,080
So the problem is,

11
00:00:32,081 --> 00:00:33,070
is when you attain a goal,

12
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:38,090
the framework within which you are
operating disappears and there's no

13
00:00:38,211 --> 00:00:39,170
necessary,

14
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:42,230
there's no necessity that it's
replaced by a better friend.

15
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:42,891
In fact,

16
00:00:42,891 --> 00:00:47,390
lots of times it's replaced by chaos
at least for some period of time.

17
00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:49,430
So it's really weird thing.

18
00:00:49,431 --> 00:00:50,900
And this is like the surface story.

19
00:00:50,901 --> 00:00:51,620
It's like,

20
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:51,841
well,

21
00:00:51,841 --> 00:00:54,380
it says office might be happy when
he's rolling the rock up the hill.
