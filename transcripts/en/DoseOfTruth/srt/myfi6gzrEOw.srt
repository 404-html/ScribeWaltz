1
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:11,410
My chapter on theisms versions of
Heaven,

2
00:00:11,411 --> 00:00:13,500
I sloped the idea.
I probably won't be accepted by

3
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:16,400
evangelicals and fundamentalists,
but you know,

4
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:21,530
when Jesus talked about the kingdom is
within a images,

5
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:24,690
there's not as,
not as often as I would've liked,

6
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:29,130
but I think he's referring to the fact
that habit is within us in the sense

7
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:31,290
that we should be aiming to improve
ourselves.

8
00:00:31,291 --> 00:00:33,990
And you know,
that Christians and atheists of

9
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:36,540
conflicted over this passage where he
says,

10
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:37,950
uh,
you know,

11
00:00:37,951 --> 00:00:39,740
Matthew Sixteen,
Twenty six,

12
00:00:39,741 --> 00:00:41,910
I say unto you,
there are some standing here which will

13
00:00:41,911 --> 00:00:44,790
not taste death until they see the son
of man coming in his kingdom.

14
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:45,670
And,
you know,

15
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:46,590
of course atheist,
go,

16
00:00:46,591 --> 00:00:47,270
ha,
ha,

17
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:48,540
ha,
he's still not here.

18
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:49,810
Uh,
but,

19
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:53,280
but what if he meant something else that
heaven is not a place to go,

20
00:00:53,281 --> 00:00:54,150
but a way to be

21
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:56,050
here.
And now I'm very,

22
00:00:56,051 --> 00:00:59,650
I'm very,
what would you call a viewpoint that I

23
00:00:59,651 --> 00:01:02,110
think is very much worth pursuing?
I would also.

24
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:05,530
But I also think there's something
deeply strange about that too because,

25
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:10,750
um,
I think that if a psychological state

26
00:01:10,751 --> 00:01:13,510
becomes profound enough,
it starts to become a social state.

27
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:17,110
And so I would say that that,
that Kingdom of God that's within,

28
00:01:17,111 --> 00:01:18,850
which is something tolstoy wrote a lot
about,

29
00:01:18,851 --> 00:01:21,580
by the way,
that was a book that he wrote,

30
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:24,910
a book called the Kingdom of God is
within us and that profoundly influenced

31
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:27,610
Mahatma Gandhi by the way.
And they had lengthy correspondence

32
00:01:27,611 --> 00:01:29,990
which was part of the reason that Gandhi
became a non

33
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:35,050
use nonviolent resistance right in his
fight against the English,

34
00:01:35,051 --> 00:01:37,810
which was quite interesting.
But I think that there is,

35
00:01:38,410 --> 00:01:43,410
there is there look something like this,
maybe when you go to a concert,

36
00:01:46,571 --> 00:01:50,160
it's a great concert and you're having a
very profound psychological experience

37
00:01:50,161 --> 00:01:51,760
of,
of unity and harmony,

38
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:53,830
which of course is what you get into
concert.

39
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:57,610
But if the experience is profound enough
psychologically and individually,

40
00:01:57,611 --> 00:02:01,060
it also starts to encompass and envelop
the people around you.

41
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:05,140
And so I think the Kingdom of God that
Christ was talking about with something

42
00:02:05,141 --> 00:02:07,090
like this is why I like jumped piaget so
much.

43
00:02:07,091 --> 00:02:11,020
It's something like the and equilibrated
state where things are working out

44
00:02:11,021 --> 00:02:14,530
really well for you when you're deeply
immersed in a meaningful experience,

45
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:18,190
but at the same time that meaning is
structured so that it's maximally

46
00:02:18,191 --> 00:02:21,400
beneficial for the people who are
immediately around you and for the

47
00:02:21,401 --> 00:02:26,200
people who are distantly related to you.
And so everything stacks up and some

48
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:28,780
that's some.
That's something like the idea of the

49
00:02:28,781 --> 00:02:30,550
ladder to have under the stairway to
heaven,

50
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:33,640
did everything stacking up properly and
then there's an.

51
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:34,930
There is.
See,

52
00:02:34,931 --> 00:02:38,140
I think when people experience that,
and this is where the metaphysics

53
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:40,600
touches the material.
I think that when people.

54
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:43,150
Yes,
exactly that precisely got yes.

55
00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:44,043
Precisely that.

56
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:47,110
Well,
did you notice that the demons are

57
00:02:47,111 --> 00:02:49,890
upside down going down,
right?

58
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:52,570
Which is exactly right.
That's exactly the right way to

59
00:02:52,571 --> 00:02:55,510
conceptualize it.
So I think that when people have an

60
00:02:55,511 --> 00:03:00,511
experience of that stacking of meaning,
that they also have an intimation of

61
00:03:01,631 --> 00:03:05,740
immortality that goes along with that.
That's embodied and that that's partly

62
00:03:05,741 --> 00:03:09,520
why they're metaphysical speculations
about the reality of the Kingdom of

63
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,050
Heaven.
There'll be merged because it's not just

64
00:03:11,051 --> 00:03:15,850
conceptual right there.
There is embodied experience and people

65
00:03:15,851 --> 00:03:19,120
report the same thing when they have
transcendental experiences of various

66
00:03:19,121 --> 00:03:21,850
sorts and those,
and we know from a scientific

67
00:03:21,851 --> 00:03:25,420
perspective that those can be very
reliably induced with the use of agents

68
00:03:25,421 --> 00:03:26,350
like psilocybin.
