1
00:00:07,070 --> 00:00:07,350
Yeah.

2
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:09,380
Well those are two very
different called questions.

3
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:12,680
How can you help your parents
to sort themselves out?

4
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:13,710
Well,

5
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:15,240
I guess the first question would be,

6
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:16,823
uh,

7
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:22,120
or do they want to sort themselves out
because it's not that easy to help people

8
00:00:22,491 --> 00:00:23,870
if they don't want to be helped.

9
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:25,073
Um,

10
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:26,810
if they do want to be helped.

11
00:00:26,811 --> 00:00:30,020
Like listening is really a good strategy.

12
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:31,493
Um,

13
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:32,663
you know,

14
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:33,863
people,

15
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:35,180
you got the question right?

16
00:00:35,181 --> 00:00:35,721
Because you said,

17
00:00:35,721 --> 00:00:38,570
how can I help my parents
to sort themselves out,

18
00:00:38,571 --> 00:00:41,240
which is very different than
how can I sort my parents out?

19
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:42,620
Um,

20
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:43,700
you help people

21
00:00:44,410 --> 00:00:49,410
to sort themselves out once they have
decided to do so by giving them the

22
00:00:49,691 --> 00:00:54,691
opportunity to talk about their concerns
and also to outline what potential

23
00:00:54,761 --> 00:00:59,761
solutions might be and you don't want to
offer any pieces of advice while you're

24
00:01:00,341 --> 00:01:05,341
doing that because it turns out that
people are much more likely to implement a

25
00:01:05,561 --> 00:01:08,770
strategy of improvement if
they generate it themselves.

26
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:11,650
And then also you don't steal
the accomplishment from them.

27
00:01:11,651 --> 00:01:11,831
Like,

28
00:01:11,831 --> 00:01:14,650
let's say you came to me with
a bunch of problems and I said,

29
00:01:14,651 --> 00:01:15,160
well,

30
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:16,870
here's what you can do about that.

31
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:21,370
And then you went out
and did it and it worked.

32
00:01:21,371 --> 00:01:23,860
And then then in some sense
that's not your accomplishment.

33
00:01:23,861 --> 00:01:25,980
I mean it is in so far as you implemented,

34
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:29,860
but it's not in so far as it
was something that I planned.

35
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:34,330
And you're intimation of that your
intimation of the fact that the

36
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:40,830
delight in success in the responsibility
for six success might've been stolen

37
00:01:41,321 --> 00:01:46,321
from you by well meaning advice is going
to interfere with the probability that

38
00:01:46,751 --> 00:01:48,190
you'll implement the solution.

39
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:53,230
And so it's best to let people
talk through their own problems.

40
00:01:53,231 --> 00:01:53,680
Like,

41
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:53,801
well,

42
00:01:53,801 --> 00:01:54,790
what's the problem?

43
00:01:55,690 --> 00:01:56,500
That's what you ask.

44
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:57,131
What's the problem?

45
00:01:57,131 --> 00:01:58,960
What do you think's not
write about your life?

46
00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:02,320
And then people will throw in a bunch
of things that they're complaining about

47
00:02:02,321 --> 00:02:03,430
or resentful about and,

48
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:07,030
and it might be quite an extensive list
and they'll feel guilty about it because

49
00:02:07,031 --> 00:02:08,430
they don't want to burden you with it,

50
00:02:08,890 --> 00:02:10,720
but they need to get
it all off their chest.

51
00:02:10,721 --> 00:02:10,871
Right?

52
00:02:10,871 --> 00:02:12,460
They need to get the cards on the table.

53
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:15,670
It's also something to know when you're
talking to your wife for your husband or

54
00:02:15,671 --> 00:02:18,190
your intimate partner or
a child for that matter,

55
00:02:18,191 --> 00:02:20,020
so when you have a close
relationship with this,

56
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:22,270
if they've got some
things to complain about,

57
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:23,740
which they undoubtedly do,

58
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:28,270
they're going to complain about a lot
more things than they're actually upset

59
00:02:28,271 --> 00:02:33,271
about because they'll have gathered up
irritations that have been unspoken and

60
00:02:33,791 --> 00:02:38,791
aggravations and fears and they'll all
be upsetting them emotionally and they

61
00:02:39,881 --> 00:02:42,850
don't know exactly what they
are until they articulate that,

62
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:43,461
you know,

63
00:02:43,461 --> 00:02:43,781
we say,

64
00:02:43,781 --> 00:02:44,111
well,

65
00:02:44,111 --> 00:02:45,190
what are you upset about?

66
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:45,521
Well,

67
00:02:45,521 --> 00:02:46,354
I don't know.

68
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:46,541
Well,

69
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:47,800
how can you not know?

70
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:48,371
Well,

71
00:02:48,371 --> 00:02:51,790
the answer is there's all sorts of things
that you respond to emotionally before

72
00:02:51,791 --> 00:02:52,930
you can articulate them.

73
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:56,740
Then you get upset and you explode and
you yell and you lay out all the things

74
00:02:56,741 --> 00:03:01,250
you might be angry about and you're
impulsive and you your case and you accuse

75
00:03:01,251 --> 00:03:04,240
people of things that you
don't even believe all of.

76
00:03:04,241 --> 00:03:07,450
That's part of the process of
laying your cards out on the table.

77
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:12,220
You have complex situations
that are disturbing you and
you don't know what they

78
00:03:12,221 --> 00:03:12,491
are.

79
00:03:12,491 --> 00:03:13,121
Exactly.

80
00:03:13,121 --> 00:03:14,260
You have to kind of guess.

81
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:14,891
So you say,

82
00:03:14,891 --> 00:03:15,011
well,

83
00:03:15,011 --> 00:03:16,240
it might be this and it might be that,

84
00:03:16,241 --> 00:03:16,950
and it might be this,

85
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:17,860
it might be you,

86
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,630
and this is why it's your fault.

87
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:22,540
You get accused Tori,

88
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,970
and then if you're listening to all that,

89
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:30,120
you have to just be patient and let the
person get all their cards out on the

90
00:03:30,731 --> 00:03:31,060
table.

91
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:34,000
Even if some of that involves
accusations about you,

92
00:03:34,001 --> 00:03:35,450
which you don't have to do immediately,

93
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:39,160
you don't have to immediately jump to
the conclusion that those accusations are

94
00:03:39,161 --> 00:03:41,020
accurate or that you
have to defend yourself.

95
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:42,330
You know,

96
00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:42,911
and I'm not,

97
00:03:42,911 --> 00:03:43,361
believe me,

98
00:03:43,361 --> 00:03:45,280
I'm not saying this is
easy because it's not,

99
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:47,620
but you listen to the
person lay out there,

100
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:49,540
their deck of complaints,

101
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:54,370
and the first thing you'll find is
that they will take 50% or maybe more,

102
00:03:54,371 --> 00:03:57,970
75% of the cards off the table right away.

103
00:03:57,971 --> 00:04:01,180
Because once they've
articulated out those concerns,

104
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:03,970
they'll find that they're
not really central.

105
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,350
They're not really the issue.

106
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:08,770
And so that leaves a smaller
number of genuine problems.

107
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,830
And then you can ask people again,

108
00:04:11,831 --> 00:04:12,370
well,

109
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:13,390
here's the problem.

110
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:15,160
Can you think of any way,

111
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:20,190
if you could conceptualize how things
would be better in relationship to that

112
00:04:20,381 --> 00:04:20,770
problem?

113
00:04:20,770 --> 00:04:23,560
Well what would a solution
look like even in principle?

114
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:26,080
And then they might say,

115
00:04:26,081 --> 00:04:26,231
well,

116
00:04:26,231 --> 00:04:26,921
I don't know.

117
00:04:26,921 --> 00:04:29,980
And then they have to guess and lay
their cards out on the table about what a

118
00:04:29,981 --> 00:04:33,190
solution might look like if
they say they don't know,

119
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:36,010
that often means they don't
want to think about it.

120
00:04:36,011 --> 00:04:39,520
And a little bit of encouragement isn't
in order and maybe a little bit of

121
00:04:39,521 --> 00:04:40,354
pressure.

122
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,273
Um,

123
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:45,070
but you want people to formulate a vision
of what the situation would look like

124
00:04:45,071 --> 00:04:46,480
if the problem was solved.

125
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:49,930
And then they might find it very
daunting because the solution looks so

126
00:04:49,931 --> 00:04:52,240
difficult that they don't
see any pathway to it.

127
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:54,940
And so then the next part
of the discussion is,

128
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:55,660
well,

129
00:04:55,660 --> 00:05:00,010
are there some things that you could do
that would be small steps that you would

130
00:05:00,011 --> 00:05:05,011
be interested in doing that you think
you would do that would move you to the

131
00:05:05,051 --> 00:05:05,830
solution?

132
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:07,900
And maybe those things
could be implemented.

133
00:05:07,901 --> 00:05:12,480
Tentatively behavioral psychologists
call that collaborative and parasitism.

134
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:16,810
So you'll come and see a behavioral
psychologist and lay out your problems and

135
00:05:16,811 --> 00:05:19,000
then the two of you
will negotiate towards,

136
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:19,450
uh,

137
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:20,740
the beginnings of a solution.

138
00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:25,450
What could you do this week that might
make that problem slightly better?

139
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:30,400
And so you talked through what's
practical and what's implementable.

140
00:05:30,401 --> 00:05:34,300
And you have to be honest about that
because you don't want to set yourself up

141
00:05:34,301 --> 00:05:35,920
with a plan that's so complicated,

142
00:05:35,921 --> 00:05:36,970
you won't implement it.

143
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:38,320
Then you say to the person,

144
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:39,460
if you're the psychologist,

145
00:05:39,461 --> 00:05:39,701
you say,

146
00:05:39,701 --> 00:05:40,420
well look,

147
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:43,810
we've got a couple of ideas about what
you could do this week that might make

148
00:05:43,811 --> 00:05:45,400
this situation slightly better.

149
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:49,000
Why don't you go and implement them and
then come back next week and we'll talk

150
00:05:49,001 --> 00:05:53,950
about whether or not that worked and work
would be you did implement it and that

151
00:05:53,951 --> 00:05:55,570
it did have the desired solution.

152
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,710
And if it didn't work,

153
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,260
meaning you didn't implement it
or the solution didn't emerge,

154
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:01,580
then there's,

155
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:04,700
there's the opportunity for renegotiation.

156
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:06,620
So you can think about it strategic.

157
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:10,940
The first issue is if something
needs to be sorted out.

158
00:06:10,941 --> 00:06:11,960
The first question is,

159
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:12,140
well,

160
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:13,460
what the hell is the problem?

161
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:15,680
And the answer that is,

162
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:16,880
you probably don't know.

163
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:20,750
The problem is I'm upset and disturbed
and angry and resentful and bitter and

164
00:06:20,751 --> 00:06:24,230
unhappy and anxious and
in pain and lonesome,

165
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:28,400
I'm suffering from an excess of negative
emotion and perhaps from a certain

166
00:06:28,401 --> 00:06:29,390
amount of hopelessness.

167
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:34,010
So the problem is the
emotional circumstance and
that might be associated with

168
00:06:34,011 --> 00:06:35,210
some real problems,

169
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:35,571
right?

170
00:06:35,571 --> 00:06:36,920
Some real practical problems.

171
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,350
So you lay all that out and say,

172
00:06:39,351 --> 00:06:39,621
okay,

173
00:06:39,621 --> 00:06:42,530
well what is the problem
landscape look like?

174
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:43,161
Right?

175
00:06:43,161 --> 00:06:44,840
So that's the strategic move.

176
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:48,650
And then as I said that we'll generally
simplify the problem landscape.

177
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:49,790
Then you do things,

178
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:52,220
the same thing with a set
of potential solutions.

179
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,980
Well what would the solutions look like?

180
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:58,460
Cause you're not going to be able to
solve a problem unless you at least know

181
00:06:58,461 --> 00:06:59,810
what a solution might look like.

182
00:06:59,811 --> 00:07:00,644
That would actually,

183
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:01,520
um,

184
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,560
what would you say that would,

185
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:05,240
that you would find acceptable?

186
00:07:05,450 --> 00:07:09,500
And then the next pro issue is to lay
out the strategies for the attainment of

187
00:07:09,501 --> 00:07:10,334
that solution.

188
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:10,971
And you know,

189
00:07:10,971 --> 00:07:14,720
sometimes it might be some of
these solutions might be dismal.

190
00:07:14,721 --> 00:07:15,110
Like,

191
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:15,740
you know,

192
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:18,050
if you've got someone
who's ill in your family,

193
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:19,520
the solution might be,

194
00:07:19,521 --> 00:07:22,430
well well we need a cure.

195
00:07:22,730 --> 00:07:23,270
You know,

196
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:25,250
that's the only solution
that will suffice.

197
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:29,690
But you don't know how to pursue
the cure or maybe one doesn't exist.

198
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:35,000
And so then you have to think of while
a lower order and less satisfying

199
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:36,561
solution,

200
00:07:36,561 --> 00:07:37,101
which would be,

201
00:07:37,101 --> 00:07:39,080
well maybe we can cope,

202
00:07:39,081 --> 00:07:42,320
we're going to learn to cope with this
so that it's the least amount of hell

203
00:07:42,321 --> 00:07:43,154
possible.

204
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:44,443
And,

205
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:45,410
and maybe that,

206
00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:46,970
maybe that even that's too much.

207
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:48,050
You might have to say,

208
00:07:48,051 --> 00:07:48,530
well,

209
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:52,310
we're going to try to make this next
week when we're coping with this better

210
00:07:52,311 --> 00:07:53,540
than the last week.

211
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:54,770
You know,

212
00:07:54,770 --> 00:07:55,603
and,

213
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:57,290
and maybe you can't even do that.

214
00:07:57,291 --> 00:07:59,180
It has to just be the next day.

215
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:03,530
You look for whatever small steps forward
you can take that will make things

216
00:08:03,531 --> 00:08:06,410
less wretched and horrible
than they currently are.

217
00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:07,230
You know,

218
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:08,660
to put it rather bluntly.

219
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:12,140
And that requires the
willingness to face the problem,

220
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:15,800
the humility to know that you
don't have the solution at hand.

221
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:19,790
The willingness to listen to how the
other people that you're talking to

222
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:23,480
formulate the problems and
formulate the solutions.

223
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:24,680
It's crucially important,

224
00:08:24,681 --> 00:08:24,921
right?

225
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:26,930
To have them do that work themselves.

226
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:27,710
It's,

227
00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:28,281
it's also,

228
00:08:28,281 --> 00:08:29,600
you could think about it this way too,

229
00:08:29,601 --> 00:08:33,200
is that if you listen to
someone come up with a solution,

230
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:39,160
you don't undergo the neurological
transformation is necessary to change your

231
00:08:39,711 --> 00:08:40,544
character.

232
00:08:40,670 --> 00:08:43,100
But if you come up with
the solutions yourself,

233
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:43,881
you know,

234
00:08:43,881 --> 00:08:46,880
if you articulate the problem
and you articulate the solutions,

235
00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:51,410
then you've changed your own character
in a way that increases the probability

236
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:52,670
that you're going to act out.

237
00:08:52,671 --> 00:08:53,504
What you do.

238
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:58,350
And that requires real patients to let
people stumble through to their own

239
00:08:58,351 --> 00:08:58,751
problems,

240
00:08:58,751 --> 00:08:59,584
solutions,

241
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:02,010
because someone might lay out a
set of problems and you think,

242
00:09:02,011 --> 00:09:02,581
oh my God,

243
00:09:02,581 --> 00:09:04,080
I know what you could do about that,

244
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,780
but it doesn't really matter if you know.

245
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:07,860
You know?

246
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:11,490
And I'm also not saying that
sometimes advice is helpful.

247
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:12,360
You know,

248
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:14,010
sometimes you can give someone a hint,

249
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:14,731
but man,

250
00:09:14,731 --> 00:09:17,820
you have to be careful with that because
there's a real element of theft that's

251
00:09:17,821 --> 00:09:18,540
associated.
