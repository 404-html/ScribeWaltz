1
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:08,740
He says,

2
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:10,480
have you read much Thomas Soul?

3
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:11,231
In many ways,

4
00:00:11,231 --> 00:00:14,770
he filled your societal role for the
last generation from a different academic

5
00:00:14,771 --> 00:00:15,430
perspective.

6
00:00:15,430 --> 00:00:17,320
I'm just reading his book right now.

7
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:18,401
It's,

8
00:00:18,401 --> 00:00:19,234
what is it,

9
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:20,283
white,

10
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:21,671
black,

11
00:00:21,671 --> 00:00:22,240
red Nixon,

12
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:22,901
white liberals?

13
00:00:22,901 --> 00:00:23,590
Is that right?

14
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:26,920
Black rednecks and white liberals.

15
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:32,293
Yeah.

16
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:33,373
Yeah.

17
00:00:33,730 --> 00:00:34,310
I,

18
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:34,730
I'm,

19
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:36,710
I'm still making my mind up about it.

20
00:00:36,711 --> 00:00:37,970
It's quite a radical idea.

21
00:00:37,971 --> 00:00:38,804
I mean,

22
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:39,733
in that book,

23
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:45,070
so claims that black urban culture is
actually a derivative of southern cracker

24
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:46,311
culture,

25
00:00:46,311 --> 00:00:51,311
and that that in turn is a derivative
of a rather dysfunctional Highland

26
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:54,740
dysfunctional British culture.

27
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:59,540
What would you call rural called British
rural culture from a couple of hundred

28
00:00:59,540 --> 00:00:59,800
years ago?

29
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:00,633
Um,

30
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:02,230
I'm still thinking it through.

31
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:04,320
I find the book really interesting and it,

32
00:01:04,321 --> 00:01:06,260
it wouldn't surprise me if it was true,

33
00:01:06,261 --> 00:01:07,560
but it's quite original.

34
00:01:07,561 --> 00:01:08,870
The thesis is quite original.

35
00:01:08,871 --> 00:01:09,704
So I'm,

36
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:15,010
I'm working my way through that right
now and I don't have anything much more

37
00:01:15,021 --> 00:01:16,310
intelligent to say than that.
