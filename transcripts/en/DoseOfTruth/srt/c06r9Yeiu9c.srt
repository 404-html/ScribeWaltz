1
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:05,180
How can women who waited too long to
have children find meaning in their lives

2
00:00:05,181 --> 00:00:06,680
once they realized their mistake?

3
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:08,660
How can we cope with the regret?

4
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:11,571
Jesus?

5
00:00:11,571 --> 00:00:12,560
That's a hard question.

6
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:16,341
Well,

7
00:00:16,341 --> 00:00:17,060
you know,

8
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:19,400
there are other avenues to meaning,

9
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:20,660
right?

10
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:21,493
I mean,

11
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:23,000
that's,

12
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,390
that's the first thing to
realize is that there are,

13
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:27,800
there's intimate relationship,

14
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:32,630
there's familial relationships that
aren't in accordance with children.

15
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:35,570
There's other people that you can serve.

16
00:00:35,630 --> 00:00:37,670
There are other children
that you can serve.

17
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:39,380
So what you have to do,

18
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:43,070
because intimate relationships
are so important,

19
00:00:43,071 --> 00:00:45,410
and I'm including that close familial,

20
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:47,150
I'm not talking about
sexual relationships.

21
00:00:47,151 --> 00:00:49,010
I'm talking about very
close social relationships.

22
00:00:49,011 --> 00:00:50,750
The thing about having children,

23
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:52,310
if you're lucky,

24
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:56,510
is that you have a relationship there
of a depth that you don't get anywhere

25
00:00:56,511 --> 00:01:00,500
else with the possible exception of your
parents and siblings and your partner.

26
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:05,150
But there's something about the child
relationship that's even more fundamental

27
00:01:05,151 --> 00:01:09,200
because the thing about having a
child is that if you have any sense,

28
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:10,460
as soon as you have a child,

29
00:01:10,461 --> 00:01:12,320
you are no longer the
most important person,

30
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:13,010
right?

31
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:15,920
You're no longer the person that
you have primary responsibility for.

32
00:01:15,921 --> 00:01:16,820
It's now your child.

33
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:20,870
And that produces a
psychological transformation
and it produces a relationship

34
00:01:20,871 --> 00:01:23,210
of a depth that can't be
easily duplicated elsewhere.

35
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:26,660
But it's not like that's the only
thing that there is to do in life.

36
00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:27,411
You know,

37
00:01:27,411 --> 00:01:28,244
there,

38
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,960
there are other relationships and I would
say what you do is you foster them to

39
00:01:32,961 --> 00:01:34,280
the degree that that's possible.

40
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:36,440
And maybe you could find
other kids to serve.

41
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:37,041
You know,

42
00:01:37,041 --> 00:01:39,680
there's always the possibility
of volunteering for hospitals or,

43
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:40,400
or,

44
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,180
or,

45
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:44,030
or working in places where
children need service.

46
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,770
So that's a possibility as well.

47
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:47,380
And so you've,

48
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:48,680
you know,

49
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:49,190
there are,

50
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:52,820
there are a variety of sources of
meaning in people's lives and they're,

51
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:53,870
they're not unlimited.

52
00:01:54,050 --> 00:01:54,321
You know,

53
00:01:54,321 --> 00:01:55,011
there's career,

54
00:01:55,011 --> 00:01:55,850
there's education,

55
00:01:55,851 --> 00:01:57,650
there's what you do that's meaningful,

56
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,570
meaningfully engages you outside of work.

57
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:01,010
There's your social relations,

58
00:02:01,011 --> 00:02:02,690
your friends and so forth.

59
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:06,950
And so maybe you have five lakes lakes
to stand on and you missed one cause he

60
00:02:06,951 --> 00:02:07,611
didn't have kids.

61
00:02:07,611 --> 00:02:09,980
Or maybe you miss too
because kids are a big deal.

62
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:12,620
But that doesn't mean the rest
of them aren't accessible to you.

63
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:16,760
And so you optimize your functioning
along the dimensions that are left to you.

64
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:21,440
And then I would also say maybe you
tried to forgive yourself a little bit.

65
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:22,311
You know,

66
00:02:22,311 --> 00:02:24,890
like it's very difficult
to go through life without

67
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:26,450
yeah.

68
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:27,410
Without regrets,

69
00:02:27,411 --> 00:02:28,700
without making mistakes.

70
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:29,090
You know,

71
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:31,940
when you can't beat yourself to death
for it because then everyone would beat

72
00:02:31,941 --> 00:02:33,290
themselves to death all the time.

73
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:35,030
And so you think,

74
00:02:35,031 --> 00:02:36,170
well that's,

75
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:37,700
that's I've,

76
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:38,240
I'm,

77
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:43,240
I'm too soon old and too late wise
to use an old cliche and you think,

78
00:02:44,151 --> 00:02:45,710
well that's the law of mankind.

79
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:48,680
We learn things too late
often and that's too bad.

80
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:51,890
And you forgive yourself because you're
stupid and you don't know what you're

81
00:02:51,891 --> 00:02:53,990
doing and you're unwise
just like everyone else.

82
00:02:53,991 --> 00:02:56,630
And maybe you're somewhat capable
of learning if you're careful.

83
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:01,540
And then you go out and you try to foster
and do good in the world to the degree

84
00:03:01,541 --> 00:03:04,480
that you can outside of the necessity of,

85
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:06,063
of children.

86
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:07,650
And maybe you have nephews,

87
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,141
nieces,

88
00:03:08,141 --> 00:03:12,250
and you can lavish some attention on
them and find your substitute where you

89
00:03:12,251 --> 00:03:13,084
can.

90
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:15,820
But I would say to forgive
yourself is a big part of that.

91
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:17,230
It's like people make mistakes,

92
00:03:17,231 --> 00:03:18,610
mad big mistakes.

93
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:22,300
And the people that I've watched
through life that have been successful,

94
00:03:22,301 --> 00:03:25,570
it's not like they didn't make mistakes
because everyone makes mistakes and they

95
00:03:25,571 --> 00:03:29,350
do things they regret and
they miss opportunities and
it's a bloody catastrophe,

96
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:34,750
but they treat themselves with some
degree of mercy along with the justice.

97
00:03:34,751 --> 00:03:35,081
It's like,

98
00:03:35,081 --> 00:03:35,351
yeah,

99
00:03:35,351 --> 00:03:38,740
well I screwed up there and I'm going to
try to learn and I'm not going to do it

100
00:03:38,741 --> 00:03:39,280
again,

101
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:42,520
but I'm not going to beat myself to
death so that I can't get up again.

102
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:45,670
And so you do what you
can to forgive yourself.

103
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:46,361
You know,

104
00:03:46,361 --> 00:03:50,260
it's a confusing time to live in in many
ways because we have the birth control

105
00:03:50,261 --> 00:03:54,310
pill now and that means reproduction
has now become voluntary.

106
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:55,300
Well,

107
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:57,010
when's a good time to reproduce?

108
00:03:57,310 --> 00:03:57,491
Well,

109
00:03:57,491 --> 00:03:58,300
never,

110
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:00,970
because who would ever
think about doing that?

111
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:05,970
It's so ridiculously irrational
and complicated and the
burden of responsibility

112
00:04:06,341 --> 00:04:09,280
is so insanely high and
you never secure enough to,

113
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:12,280
to have the proper place to
bring children into the world.

114
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:14,440
And you have to get your
career going and your,

115
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:16,690
and your intimate relationship.

116
00:04:16,691 --> 00:04:19,540
And maybe you have some struggle doing
that and one day you wake up and it's a

117
00:04:19,541 --> 00:04:20,374
bit late.

118
00:04:20,530 --> 00:04:20,831
It's like,

119
00:04:20,831 --> 00:04:21,101
yeah,

120
00:04:21,101 --> 00:04:24,220
well you're a product of your time.

121
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:30,420
And one of the prices that we're going
to pay for having birth control for

122
00:04:30,521 --> 00:04:35,521
having reliable contraception is that
some people are going to make the wrong

123
00:04:35,741 --> 00:04:37,480
decision with regards to having children.

124
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,210
And then you view yourself
as a product of your time.

125
00:04:40,211 --> 00:04:41,350
And that's a catastrophe,

126
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:42,010
you know,

127
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:44,890
because to be a product of your
time is in some ways a catastrophe.

128
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,353
So,

129
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:49,800
but there's other things
to do in life and,

130
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:53,590
and augering yourself into
the ground with regret and,

131
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:54,370
and,

132
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:55,203
and,

133
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:58,750
and self recrimination is not useful.

134
00:04:59,290 --> 00:04:59,650
Right?

135
00:04:59,650 --> 00:04:59,921
I mean,

136
00:04:59,921 --> 00:05:01,000
you have to learn your lesson,

137
00:05:01,001 --> 00:05:01,900
you have to take your lumps,

138
00:05:01,901 --> 00:05:02,734
all of that,

139
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:05,620
but have some mercy.

140
00:05:05,621 --> 00:05:06,454
You know?

141
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:08,261
That's,

142
00:05:08,261 --> 00:05:08,470
it.
