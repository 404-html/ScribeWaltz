1
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:19,730
Welcome to the September
version of my Q and A's.

2
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:20,750
And uh,

3
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:23,120
thank you very much for tuning in again.

4
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:24,703
Um,

5
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:27,830
hopefully we'll have an
interesting discussion tonight.

6
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:33,100
I want to stop start that is with a
demonstration of some new newly managed

7
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:37,070
technical wizardry.

8
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:40,340
I have a program that I developed with
my colleagues that I want to talk to you

9
00:00:40,341 --> 00:00:41,960
guys about for just a few seconds.

10
00:00:41,961 --> 00:00:45,290
Some of you already know about this
called self authoring and self authoring

11
00:00:45,291 --> 00:00:48,770
helps people write about their
past to guide it autobiography,

12
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:52,550
that's the past authoring program and
to write about their virtues and their

13
00:00:52,551 --> 00:00:53,001
faults.

14
00:00:53,001 --> 00:00:57,620
That's there's to present
offering programs and a
future authoring program that

15
00:00:57,621 --> 00:01:01,310
helps people write out a
vision and a destination,

16
00:01:01,311 --> 00:01:06,311
let's say an ethical destination for
their lives as well as formulate a plan to

17
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:09,500
put that vision into,

18
00:01:09,501 --> 00:01:11,030
to make that vision into reality.

19
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:14,000
And our experimental
investigations have indicated,

20
00:01:14,001 --> 00:01:14,661
for example,

21
00:01:14,661 --> 00:01:17,450
that university students
who complete this program,

22
00:01:17,451 --> 00:01:18,770
even if they do it badly,

23
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:21,140
and I would recommend
at least doing it badly,

24
00:01:21,410 --> 00:01:25,790
increase their probability of staying
at university by about 30% and it has a

25
00:01:25,791 --> 00:01:28,220
positive effect on their
grade point average as well.

26
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:33,140
So there's a fair bit of evidence that
your personality is organized at the

27
00:01:33,141 --> 00:01:35,840
highest level through articulated speech.

28
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:39,380
Some of that you can formulate internally
by thinking and some of it you have to

29
00:01:39,381 --> 00:01:39,650
do,

30
00:01:39,650 --> 00:01:40,730
you can do by writing.

31
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:43,280
You also do that in
discussion with other people.

32
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:48,320
But these programs are designed to break
down the problem of articulating your

33
00:01:48,321 --> 00:01:49,580
life in the past,

34
00:01:49,581 --> 00:01:54,050
present and future into a series of
steps that are at least in principle

35
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,290
manageable and uh,

36
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:56,630
uh,

37
00:01:56,630 --> 00:02:00,330
thousands of people have done them and I
think they're very helpful programs and

38
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:00,891
uh,

39
00:02:00,891 --> 00:02:03,620
we spent a lot of time perfecting them,

40
00:02:03,621 --> 00:02:05,540
I suppose to the degree
that they are perfected.

41
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:06,321
Anyways,

42
00:02:06,321 --> 00:02:07,154
I want to,

43
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,810
here's the high tech part of this.

44
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:15,280
You see that's the website
self authoring.com and
I've put a coupon together.

45
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:18,470
Um,

46
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:20,720
the coupon name is September.

47
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:22,880
So that's what you have
to enter for this coupon.

48
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:26,000
And that gives you a 20%
discount at self authoring.

49
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:26,841
So,

50
00:02:26,841 --> 00:02:31,841
and now all this is even more high tech
because this marker is in a different

51
00:02:31,881 --> 00:02:32,714
color.

52
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:37,810
And this program is a personality test
based on the big five aspect scale,

53
00:02:40,191 --> 00:02:43,910
which is a scale that calling the young
one of my students developed when he

54
00:02:43,911 --> 00:02:46,490
worked in my lab along with Lena quilty.

55
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:47,510
And,

56
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:47,930
uh,

57
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:52,040
the big five aspects scale offers you
a five dimensional readout of your

58
00:02:52,041 --> 00:02:52,880
personality,

59
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:53,631
extroversion,

60
00:02:53,631 --> 00:02:54,291
neuroticism,

61
00:02:54,291 --> 00:02:54,891
agreeableness,

62
00:02:54,891 --> 00:02:56,300
conscientiousness and openness.

63
00:02:56,301 --> 00:03:00,730
The classic big five and minute breaks
each of the factors of the traits into

64
00:03:00,731 --> 00:03:01,481
two aspects.

65
00:03:01,481 --> 00:03:05,530
So you get a high resolution map of
your personality that takes the test,

66
00:03:05,531 --> 00:03:07,000
takes about a hundred questions,

67
00:03:07,001 --> 00:03:11,080
takes about 15 minutes to do
and you'll learn about yourself.

68
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,760
I think you'll learn interesting things.

69
00:03:12,761 --> 00:03:16,480
I had my kids do repeated iterations
of the big five aspects scale when they

70
00:03:16,481 --> 00:03:17,201
were teenagers.

71
00:03:17,201 --> 00:03:20,260
And I learned a lot about them even
though I thought I knew them quite well.

72
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:21,970
I learned things that were very useful.

73
00:03:21,971 --> 00:03:22,804
So,

74
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:23,470
um,

75
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:26,440
you can do that and maybe you'll
understand yourself a little bit better.

76
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:27,783
And so

77
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:33,380
this is the site

78
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:40,600
and the coupon is September just
as it was for self authoring

79
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:46,250
and that's 20% as well.

80
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:51,730
And you'll see that amazingly enough,

81
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:57,040
this advertisement I suppose,

82
00:03:57,041 --> 00:03:57,940
which is what it is,

83
00:03:58,090 --> 00:03:59,800
is in purple instead of blue.

84
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:04,810
And so that's another technological
miracle brought to you by the Internet and

85
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:08,170
the intelligence of modern human beings.

86
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:09,550
So all right,

87
00:04:09,551 --> 00:04:10,990
so we've dispensed with that.

88
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:15,790
So that's self authoring and understand
myself and you might find those useful

89
00:04:15,791 --> 00:04:19,330
and I hope you do so onto more,

90
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:20,903
um,

91
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,350
fall on different things.

92
00:04:23,351 --> 00:04:27,070
I guess I just got back
to Toronto yesterday,

93
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:29,110
I think it was yesterday.

94
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,150
I was out in western Canada.

95
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:35,330
I went to a family reunion on
Vancouver Island and then a,

96
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:40,200
a reunion of sorts as well in Saskatchewan
with my side of the family and a

97
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:43,600
finished the talk and Regina
and Saskatoon as well,

98
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:46,150
which seemed to be
relatively well received.

99
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:47,860
So hurray for that.

100
00:04:47,861 --> 00:04:51,240
I've really enjoyed all these
lectures that I've been giving.

101
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,073
And Tammy and I,

102
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:53,230
Tammy's my wife,

103
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:58,680
we visited 65 cities now on this tour
and we're starting again on September 5th

104
00:04:59,561 --> 00:05:01,090
we're going to go down
the eastern seaboard.

105
00:05:01,091 --> 00:05:02,240
There's 20 cities in,

106
00:05:02,241 --> 00:05:03,820
in the northeastern us.

107
00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:07,300
And then we're off to Europe
for another 15 cities or so.

108
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:10,180
And then in February I think
we're going to go to Australia.

109
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:13,000
And then in March and
April back to Europe.

110
00:05:13,001 --> 00:05:14,830
And then in May,

111
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:20,280
I'm going to spend four months diligently
finishing up what I hope to be my next

112
00:05:21,311 --> 00:05:21,641
book,

113
00:05:21,641 --> 00:05:24,940
if assuming that I can get that
done in that period of time.

114
00:05:24,941 --> 00:05:27,550
And also that other opportunities,

115
00:05:27,551 --> 00:05:28,001
let's say,

116
00:05:28,001 --> 00:05:31,870
or distractions don't rear their
head either positively or negatively.

117
00:05:31,871 --> 00:05:32,950
And who knows,

118
00:05:32,951 --> 00:05:33,310
right?

119
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:35,680
Because life is a very uncertain business.

120
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:38,800
I've really enjoyed
the lecture tour a lot.

121
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,113
Um,

122
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:40,960
you know,

123
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:45,960
I've been speaking to audiences of about
2,500 to 3000 people and mostly about

124
00:05:47,321 --> 00:05:47,860
the,

125
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:49,750
I would say mostly about the nexus,

126
00:05:49,751 --> 00:05:53,650
the relationship between
meaning and responsibility,

127
00:05:53,651 --> 00:05:57,830
trying to make the case that because
life is difficult as everyone with any

128
00:05:57,831 --> 00:05:58,760
sense knows.

129
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:03,290
And because we can make that worse with
our own stupidity and malevolence that

130
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:06,770
it's necessary to find a
sustaining meaning in life.

131
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:08,540
And my sense is,

132
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:11,000
and I think people tend to agree to this,

133
00:06:11,001 --> 00:06:16,001
is that the most sustaining meaning can
be found a and the adoption of voluntary

134
00:06:16,671 --> 00:06:17,600
responsibility.

135
00:06:17,601 --> 00:06:22,190
So in attempts to decrease the suffering
in life and to do things that are

136
00:06:22,191 --> 00:06:26,690
worthwhile and admirable and to take
care of yourself individually and your

137
00:06:26,691 --> 00:06:27,171
family,

138
00:06:27,171 --> 00:06:31,250
and to have a little bit leftover for
your community and to have goodwill across

139
00:06:31,251 --> 00:06:35,380
all those dimensions if you can possibly
manage it despite the fact that there's

140
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:37,820
something in life to make
people relatively bitter.

141
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:39,133
And then,

142
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,193
um,

143
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:45,370
as well the necessity of conducting
yourself in a truthful manner.

144
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,010
Um,

145
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:48,320
making also the case to my listeners,

146
00:06:48,321 --> 00:06:53,321
I suppose that that one of the most
ancient presuppositions that underlies the

147
00:06:53,781 --> 00:06:55,460
structure of Western civilization,

148
00:06:55,461 --> 00:06:58,910
which is a very functional
civilization in my estimation,

149
00:06:58,911 --> 00:07:01,550
is the idea derived from genesis,

150
00:07:01,551 --> 00:07:03,740
that truthful speech,

151
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,350
if you confront truthful speech,

152
00:07:06,351 --> 00:07:07,700
if you confront potential,

153
00:07:07,701 --> 00:07:11,750
the chaos and potential that is in
front of you with truthful speech,

154
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:14,780
that you engender the order that is good.

155
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,970
And that's a fundamental ethical dictum.

156
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:17,301
It's,

157
00:07:17,301 --> 00:07:17,631
it's,

158
00:07:17,631 --> 00:07:22,100
it's a presupposition in some sense that
the order that you bring into existence

159
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:26,900
in all the choices that you make will
be the best possible order in proportion

160
00:07:26,901 --> 00:07:30,110
to the degree that you conduct
yourself in a truthful manner.

161
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:35,060
And so those ideas seem to be falling
on very receptive ears and they are the

162
00:07:35,061 --> 00:07:39,710
most resilient ideas that I
think I've ever come across.

163
00:07:39,711 --> 00:07:40,011
I mean,

164
00:07:40,011 --> 00:07:44,720
I always take an ice pick and a hammer
to any idea that I encounter and I really

165
00:07:44,721 --> 00:07:48,890
do that diligently because I don't want
to rely on ideas that can fall apart and

166
00:07:48,891 --> 00:07:49,221
break,

167
00:07:49,221 --> 00:07:50,570
especially when they're stressed.

168
00:07:50,571 --> 00:07:51,950
And I don't see,

169
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:52,790
I don't,

170
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:56,390
I haven't come across ideas
that are more solid than that.

171
00:07:56,391 --> 00:07:57,200
I mean,

172
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,400
the first proposition,

173
00:07:58,401 --> 00:08:01,610
you know that life is suffering and that
we make it worse with our malevolence.

174
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:03,740
I think everyone
understands that to be true.

175
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:09,080
But the second is that the best
way to confront that is to shoulder

176
00:08:09,290 --> 00:08:12,920
responsibility voluntarily
and to live in truth.

177
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:16,970
I think those are even more powerful
ideas because you could say that the cure

178
00:08:16,971 --> 00:08:20,990
for a malaise or the treatment for a
disease is more powerful than the Malaysia

179
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:22,880
Malays or the disease itself.

180
00:08:22,881 --> 00:08:27,860
And If responsibility and truth are
antidotes to suffering and malevolence,

181
00:08:27,861 --> 00:08:30,170
then that means that they're there.

182
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:35,210
They have a power that's transcendent
over suffering and malevolence and you

183
00:08:35,211 --> 00:08:35,361
know,

184
00:08:35,361 --> 00:08:35,571
it's so,

185
00:08:35,571 --> 00:08:37,070
it's a very pessimistic viewpoint.

186
00:08:37,071 --> 00:08:37,671
And the one hand,

187
00:08:37,671 --> 00:08:42,110
because I'm stressing for everybody
that is coming to listen to me talk,

188
00:08:42,111 --> 00:08:46,220
the fact that life has an inalienable
element of difficulty and,

189
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:49,190
and travail and suffering and all of that,

190
00:08:49,191 --> 00:08:52,280
and you certainly see that sort of
thing when you go to a family reunion.

191
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:52,551
You know,

192
00:08:52,551 --> 00:08:54,440
like a lot of my relatives,

193
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:55,890
my parents' generation,

194
00:08:55,891 --> 00:08:56,251
they're getting,

195
00:08:56,251 --> 00:08:58,050
all of my parents are in
their eighties now and,

196
00:08:58,170 --> 00:08:58,921
and their friends,

197
00:08:58,921 --> 00:08:59,371
some of the,

198
00:08:59,371 --> 00:09:03,390
they have friends that are older and
everyone's starting to suffer from the

199
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:06,690
inevitable deterioration
that's associated with old age.

200
00:09:06,691 --> 00:09:07,291
And it's very,

201
00:09:07,291 --> 00:09:09,390
very trying and very difficult for people.

202
00:09:09,391 --> 00:09:10,390
And it's,

203
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:15,210
it's in those situations that you see
more clearly the fragility of life and

204
00:09:15,211 --> 00:09:17,010
also the importance of having,

205
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:17,933
uh,

206
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,410
having a family that's functional and
people around you that love you and all

207
00:09:22,411 --> 00:09:26,340
those things that in principle can help
sustain you through difficult times.

208
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:28,980
So anyways,

209
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,380
I'm here in Toronto for about 10 days,

210
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:36,700
got a lot of media interviews again
partly to discuss the upcoming talks.

211
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:39,133
Um,

212
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:44,150
my book 12 rules for life still appears
to be selling extraordinarily well.

213
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:44,670
Um,

214
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:45,503
it's quite

215
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:47,701
amazing.

216
00:09:47,701 --> 00:09:48,900
All things considered.

217
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,960
It's approaching 2 million sales in,

218
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:52,480
in,

219
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,740
in the English version.

220
00:09:53,741 --> 00:09:54,574
And um,

221
00:09:54,950 --> 00:09:57,390
there are foreign versions
coming out all the time.

222
00:09:57,870 --> 00:09:58,703
So,

223
00:09:58,950 --> 00:10:00,420
and I've also,

224
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:05,900
I'm also in the process of
putting together the final
arrangements for my next

225
00:10:06,331 --> 00:10:06,631
book,

226
00:10:06,631 --> 00:10:07,500
which I talked about.

227
00:10:07,501 --> 00:10:08,820
So the plan is to,

228
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:09,510
to write,

229
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:10,440
I'm writing that now.

230
00:10:10,441 --> 00:10:11,730
I've got it about half written,

231
00:10:11,731 --> 00:10:15,450
maybe a little bit more expanding on the
themes that I developed in 12 rules for

232
00:10:15,451 --> 00:10:19,800
life and also extending them
as much as I possibly can.

233
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:21,053
Um,

234
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:26,220
and I hope to continue writing during
this period of touring as well so that I

235
00:10:26,221 --> 00:10:30,150
can stay on top of my deadlines and then
from May to September to spend most of

236
00:10:30,151 --> 00:10:34,380
that time finalizing and editing
and polishing and all of that.

237
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:39,800
And then hopefully the book is due in
September and the current plan is to spend

238
00:10:40,141 --> 00:10:41,610
September through December,

239
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:42,870
um,

240
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:47,550
likely concentrating on a return to the
biblical lectures starting with exodus,

241
00:10:47,551 --> 00:10:51,090
which is something I'm really looking
forward to but haven't really been able to

242
00:10:51,091 --> 00:10:51,924
turn my hand to.

243
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:54,120
The other thing I'm really
thinking hard about doing,

244
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:58,140
I'd like to do a series of lectures and
I don't know if I could do them publicly

245
00:10:58,141 --> 00:10:58,471
or not,

246
00:10:58,471 --> 00:11:00,510
but I might be able to
finagle that in some manner.

247
00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:05,930
I'd like to do a series of lectures on
the sacred icons of the radical left.

248
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:11,100
So I'd like to do a lecture series
on marks and Fuco and Derrida,

249
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,210
and then some,

250
00:11:12,210 --> 00:11:13,860
some of the famous feminist too,

251
00:11:13,861 --> 00:11:17,370
like Betty for Dan whose
work I'm not a fan of,

252
00:11:17,690 --> 00:11:18,270
um,

253
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:20,970
for a variety of reasons and
do Judith Butler as well.

254
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:23,340
But I'd really like to
concentrate on marks.

255
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:24,211
So,

256
00:11:24,211 --> 00:11:25,044
uh,

257
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:28,700
one of the things I might duty for
you guys tonight or two you have,

258
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:33,690
one of the things I might
do to you tonight is I found
a poem by Karl Marx that

259
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:38,910
is extraordinarily interesting and
that might be worth reading if I can.

260
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:40,800
I just thought about doing that,

261
00:11:40,801 --> 00:11:42,900
if I can scrape it up in time.

262
00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:47,070
So let me just check very quickly and
see if I can find it and then I'll get to

263
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:47,731
some questions.

264
00:11:47,731 --> 00:11:48,511
Because after all,

265
00:11:48,511 --> 00:11:49,950
this is a Q and a,

266
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:51,143
right?

267
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,080
That's the theory.

268
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:53,910
So.
