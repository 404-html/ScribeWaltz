1
00:00:06,610 --> 00:00:07,443
So the Dallas,

2
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:08,081
for example,

3
00:00:08,081 --> 00:00:09,280
they represent the world

4
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:14,860
in terms that are quite similar to
those that I just described for you.

5
00:00:14,861 --> 00:00:17,980
So that the doubt central
Dow assemble is this one,

6
00:00:18,370 --> 00:00:23,170
the Yin Yang symbol and Yang
basically stands for order.

7
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:23,951
That's what it means.

8
00:00:23,951 --> 00:00:26,110
But it means all the things
that I've listed there.

9
00:00:26,111 --> 00:00:27,790
It means order masculinity,

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:28,751
the daytime,

11
00:00:28,751 --> 00:00:29,560
the known,

12
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:31,840
it also means
authoritarianism and fascism.

13
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:35,050
And then yen on the
opposite side is chaos.

14
00:00:35,051 --> 00:00:35,771
Femininity,

15
00:00:35,771 --> 00:00:36,340
the night,

16
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:38,210
the unknown decadence denialism.

17
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:41,260
And it's also a relationship between
the conscious and unconscious.

18
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:44,290
The current consciousness
is represented by light.

19
00:00:44,650 --> 00:00:45,790
And the reason for that is,

20
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:46,990
well,

21
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:48,490
when are you conscious?

22
00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:50,350
Your conscious during the day,

23
00:00:50,410 --> 00:00:50,681
right?

24
00:00:50,681 --> 00:00:51,400
Cause we're,

25
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:52,150
we're,

26
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:54,010
we're creatures that live in the day.

27
00:00:54,011 --> 00:00:55,480
Unlike rats for example,

28
00:00:55,481 --> 00:00:55,721
you know,

29
00:00:55,721 --> 00:00:56,554
they live at night.

30
00:00:56,860 --> 00:00:58,630
So for us,

31
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:03,310
consciousness is associated
with enlightenment and
illumination and daytime and

32
00:01:03,311 --> 00:01:04,360
sunrise and the,

33
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:05,980
and the bright noon sky.

34
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:08,370
And the unconscious is
associated with the nighttime.

35
00:01:08,371 --> 00:01:11,680
And the reason for that partly too is
that your unconscious is actually a lot

36
00:01:11,681 --> 00:01:12,610
more active at night.

37
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:13,391
First of all,

38
00:01:13,391 --> 00:01:14,440
that's when you dream.

39
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:16,480
And it's also the time when,

40
00:01:16,481 --> 00:01:20,260
if you're frightened of something or
if you're depressed and ruminative the

41
00:01:20,261 --> 00:01:23,410
frightening thoughts and the depressing
and ruminative thoughts are going to

42
00:01:23,411 --> 00:01:24,220
come up.

43
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:24,971
So many,

44
00:01:24,971 --> 00:01:28,330
many people have the experience
of waking up in a kind of,

45
00:01:28,331 --> 00:01:30,700
cause I called sweat at three
in the morning and having,

46
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:31,210
you know,

47
00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:34,330
nothing but it continual stream
of worries run through their head.

48
00:01:34,331 --> 00:01:37,870
And there's pretty good evidence that a
lot of what you're doing at night when

49
00:01:37,871 --> 00:01:38,704
you sleep,

50
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:42,400
when you're dreaming and when you're not
dreaming is actually processing threat,

51
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:43,091
you know?

52
00:01:43,091 --> 00:01:44,860
But most of the time you
were asleep for that.

53
00:01:44,861 --> 00:01:46,840
Sometimes you wake up
during it and it's like,

54
00:01:46,841 --> 00:01:47,350
yeah,

55
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:49,420
it's not something you really
want to be conscious about.

56
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:50,020
You know,

57
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:50,470
it's,

58
00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:51,281
it's hard on you.

59
00:01:51,281 --> 00:01:52,180
And it's very,

60
00:01:52,181 --> 00:01:54,040
very common among people
who are depressed,

61
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:54,993
you know?

62
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:57,370
So if you want to diagnose
someone for depression,

63
00:01:57,371 --> 00:01:58,450
one of the things you ask them is,

64
00:01:58,840 --> 00:01:59,081
well,

65
00:01:59,081 --> 00:02:00,850
is your sleep chopped up?

66
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:01,241
You know,

67
00:02:01,241 --> 00:02:04,330
do you wake up multiple times
at night and when you wake up,

68
00:02:04,331 --> 00:02:05,500
what happens if they say,

69
00:02:05,501 --> 00:02:08,410
well you know I have worries running
through my head and I can't stop them.

70
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:09,930
That's rumination cause it's,

71
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,440
it's an automatic process.

72
00:02:11,441 --> 00:02:12,730
It's an unconscious process.

73
00:02:12,731 --> 00:02:17,020
Then you know that the balance between
positive and negative emotion has shifted

74
00:02:17,021 --> 00:02:18,250
too far for that person.

75
00:02:18,251 --> 00:02:22,450
There's so much chaos and
pain in their life or their,

76
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:27,010
their emotional systems have become
dysregulated that it's starting to pop up

77
00:02:27,011 --> 00:02:28,660
into consciousness and dominated.

78
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:33,250
So now the Yin Yang symbol is interesting
for a variety of other reasons too

79
00:02:33,251 --> 00:02:38,251
because the dow is believed that that
symbol represents being now being is not

80
00:02:40,151 --> 00:02:45,151
the same thing as objective reality being
is what you experience has a conscious

81
00:02:45,161 --> 00:02:50,140
creature that's being and for the Dow is
being is made up of these two elements,

82
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:51,490
order in chaos.

83
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:52,720
And the reason for that,

84
00:02:52,721 --> 00:02:53,710
it's quite straight forward.

85
00:02:53,711 --> 00:02:58,000
The reason for that is wherever you go
and whenever you live and whoever you

86
00:02:58,001 --> 00:02:58,834
are,

87
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:03,700
each environment that you're
in is composed of things
you understand and things

88
00:03:03,701 --> 00:03:07,630
that work the way you expect them
to and things you do not understand.

89
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:08,680
And that can be,

90
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:11,020
that can pull the rug out
from you at any moment.

91
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:15,220
And so you can say in some sense that
these symbolic representations are

92
00:03:15,221 --> 00:03:19,330
representations of the most
unchanging elements of Ba.

93
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:21,460
So the most real things,

94
00:03:21,461 --> 00:03:22,111
because you know,

95
00:03:22,111 --> 00:03:24,160
a typical modern person
look at this and think,

96
00:03:24,161 --> 00:03:25,060
well those aren't real.

97
00:03:25,061 --> 00:03:26,590
It's like they are real.

98
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:27,071
In fact,

99
00:03:27,071 --> 00:03:28,120
they're hyper real.

100
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:32,950
Because one of the things that defines
real is that it's permanent and it is

101
00:03:32,951 --> 00:03:33,431
permanent.

102
00:03:33,431 --> 00:03:34,270
No matter where you go,

103
00:03:34,271 --> 00:03:36,010
there are things you know
and things you don't know.

104
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:37,330
And it doesn't matter who you are,

105
00:03:37,331 --> 00:03:38,164
it's permanent.

106
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:42,070
So it's part of the existential
landscape of human being.

107
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:43,570
Now the other thing that's,

108
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:46,750
there's two other things that are quite
cool about the Yin Yang symbol in one is

109
00:03:46,751 --> 00:03:48,010
that the,

110
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:51,010
each of the black pacey
has little white.in it.

111
00:03:51,011 --> 00:03:52,780
And the White Paisley
has a little black.in it.

112
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:57,130
And the reason for that is the Taoists
also recognized quite well that chaos

113
00:03:57,131 --> 00:03:58,780
could turn to order at any moment.

114
00:03:59,080 --> 00:03:59,291
You know,

115
00:03:59,291 --> 00:04:02,700
so a new order can arise out of a
chaotic structure that's like a,

116
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,630
that's a revolution in some sense.

117
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:06,430
But by the same token,

118
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:08,860
if you're in a place that's
orderly and predictable,

119
00:04:08,861 --> 00:04:12,310
something can happen that casts you
into a chaotic situation right away.

120
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,660
So there's a dynamic,

121
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:15,820
even though these two
things oppose each other,

122
00:04:15,821 --> 00:04:16,654
in some sense,

123
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,330
there's a continual dynamic
interplay between them.

124
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:22,660
And then the final thing that's
quite interesting about this symbol,

125
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:25,780
this is mindbogglingly brilliant idea,

126
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:30,910
is that cause the dao also means that
the way and the way is the line between

127
00:04:30,911 --> 00:04:31,744
the two.

128
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:34,150
And so what that indicates is,

129
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:35,470
this is a brilliant idea,

130
00:04:35,471 --> 00:04:40,471
is that the optimal position for a
human being isn't in chaos or in order.

131
00:04:41,981 --> 00:04:43,210
Because if it's too much order,

132
00:04:43,211 --> 00:04:44,440
then it's totalitarian.

133
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:49,120
And if it's too much chaos than it's
disgust and fear and emotional pain and

134
00:04:49,121 --> 00:04:49,954
depression.

135
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:55,140
So where's the proper place and the
Dallas answers right on the line where you

136
00:04:55,601 --> 00:04:59,440
have one foot in order so that you're
fairly stable and you'll have another foot

137
00:04:59,441 --> 00:05:00,071
in chaos.

138
00:05:00,071 --> 00:05:04,090
So that new and interesting and compelling
and transforming things are happening

139
00:05:04,091 --> 00:05:04,720
to you.

140
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:09,720
And one of the things that you might note
is that your nervous system basically

141
00:05:09,761 --> 00:05:14,530
tells you when you're there and the way
it tells you is by making you interested

142
00:05:14,531 --> 00:05:16,300
in whatever it is that you're engaged in.

143
00:05:16,301 --> 00:05:20,410
Because the fact that the thing
that you're engaged in grips you,

144
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,990
which is really an unconscious process,

145
00:05:22,991 --> 00:05:24,400
you can't really control that.

146
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,980
It's something that happens to you
is because your nervous system,

147
00:05:26,981 --> 00:05:31,900
which is actually adapted
to the environment of chaos
and order is telling you

148
00:05:31,901 --> 00:05:34,060
that if you're engaged in interested,

149
00:05:34,061 --> 00:05:38,080
you are at in the place where the
balance between chaos and order is,

150
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:39,163
is perfect.

151
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:40,450
Now you think about that,

152
00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:45,100
it's no use reading a paper that
you cannot understand at all.

153
00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:48,400
Even though hypothetically that would
be a tremendously informative paper,

154
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:49,120
right?

155
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:52,090
But you can't understand it
because it's all chaos to you.

156
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:55,540
And then there's absolutely
no reason reading a paper,

157
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,680
the tense time.

158
00:05:56,681 --> 00:05:59,600
If you've extracted the
information out of it,

159
00:05:59,601 --> 00:06:00,770
it's going to be boring.

160
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:01,491
Okay,

161
00:06:01,491 --> 00:06:02,330
so what do you want?

162
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:02,941
Well,

163
00:06:02,941 --> 00:06:05,360
you want a paper that you
can almost understand.

164
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:06,470
So there's,

165
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:06,831
you know,

166
00:06:06,831 --> 00:06:07,041
you're,

167
00:06:07,041 --> 00:06:08,300
you're the frameworks,

168
00:06:08,301 --> 00:06:12,830
the cognitive frameworks that you have
at hand are sufficient for you to take

169
00:06:12,831 --> 00:06:14,570
the next step into the unknown.

170
00:06:14,571 --> 00:06:15,620
And the paper will,

171
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:17,120
will inform you of that.

172
00:06:17,121 --> 00:06:18,560
And so those are the sorts of things.

173
00:06:18,561 --> 00:06:19,311
Books do that.

174
00:06:19,311 --> 00:06:24,110
Movies do that conversations do that
even lines of thought to that if they're

175
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:27,860
exactly at the right level
of complexity for you,

176
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:29,300
they're going to engage you.

177
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:31,220
And people know this man.

178
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:31,971
They know it.

179
00:06:31,971 --> 00:06:33,200
So here's an example.
