1
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:11,070
The psychological significance of the
biblical stories they've been sold out and

2
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:13,560
a crazy thing,

3
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:18,210
the question and answer period at
the end has been so sophisticated,

4
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,890
really in depth questions and the
audience is really tuned in and very,

5
00:00:22,891 --> 00:00:27,360
very mature and there's so much respect
and silence during the entire lecture.

6
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:28,850
I'm sure you're very pleased,

7
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:30,180
but it's amazing.

8
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:30,480
Yeah,

9
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,180
I'm really pleased about it and
I've learned a tremendous amount.

10
00:00:33,181 --> 00:00:33,660
I mean,

11
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:37,680
part of the reason I wanted to do a series
on the psychological significance of

12
00:00:37,681 --> 00:00:39,960
the biblical stories for a long time,

13
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:42,060
15 years probably,

14
00:00:42,061 --> 00:00:45,770
and never had the opportunity.

15
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:47,460
You never set itself up properly.

16
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:48,181
And I've,

17
00:00:48,181 --> 00:00:51,690
I've learned a ridiculous about doing
it then I'm really looking forward to

18
00:00:51,691 --> 00:00:52,560
starting it up again.

19
00:00:52,561 --> 00:00:55,920
I'm going to try to do it to
go through exodus next year.

20
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:56,940
Um,

21
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:00,270
I really liked [inaudible] stories
and I know the better than I did the

22
00:01:00,271 --> 00:01:01,230
Abrahamic stories,

23
00:01:01,231 --> 00:01:02,064
for example,

24
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:03,600
if I had to do a lot of learning,

25
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:04,620
but that's okay.

26
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:05,520
It's often,

27
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:07,500
it's a funny thing when you're lecturing.

28
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:08,970
Sometimes it's,

29
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:09,691
I mean,

30
00:01:09,691 --> 00:01:14,160
you need to have a fairly
wide background of knowledge.

31
00:01:14,161 --> 00:01:15,240
Say that you can draw from,

32
00:01:15,241 --> 00:01:16,074
but in,

33
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:16,590
in,

34
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:16,950
in,

35
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:18,180
in a more specific way.

36
00:01:18,181 --> 00:01:22,560
Sometimes it's not bad to be just one
step ahead of the audience and be learning

37
00:01:22,561 --> 00:01:25,260
along with them because it
keeps the material really fresh.

38
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:26,341
So yeah,

39
00:01:26,341 --> 00:01:27,174
that's been,

40
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:28,650
that's been an amazing thing.

41
00:01:28,651 --> 00:01:31,500
I don't know how many people have
watched those biblical lectures now,

42
00:01:31,501 --> 00:01:33,750
but I think it's something
upwards of 5 million.

43
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:34,663
Yeah,

44
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:35,580
that's remarkable.

45
00:01:35,581 --> 00:01:36,414
And you know,

46
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:40,320
what's even more remarkable to me is when
I attend is the number of young people

47
00:01:40,321 --> 00:01:41,160
in the audience.

48
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:42,840
And you know,

49
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:46,560
that's been really encouraging because
I think statistically if we look at

50
00:01:46,561 --> 00:01:47,394
across the board,

51
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:53,250
I know that young people show not a
very strong interest in religion or

52
00:01:53,251 --> 00:01:54,120
religious stories,

53
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:56,340
but they certainly don't attend church.

54
00:01:56,341 --> 00:01:58,050
And that's true for young men.

55
00:01:58,051 --> 00:02:02,640
And I know it's really funny because I'm
talking to young men about religion and

56
00:02:02,641 --> 00:02:06,510
responsibility and there
there's a huge market for it,

57
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:07,583
which is

58
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:09,773
amazing.

59
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:11,040
Excuse me.

60
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:12,180
It's just amazing.

61
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:15,510
Unpredictable,

62
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:16,280
right?

63
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:19,320
A part of me is not surprised
because as you know,

64
00:02:19,321 --> 00:02:23,550
I've spent the last 22 years kind of in
various types of social services from

65
00:02:23,551 --> 00:02:25,140
child protection to young offenders.

66
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:30,830
And the one thing I noticed is that
people were like starving for some type of

67
00:02:31,531 --> 00:02:35,200
structure and morality
and some type of um,

68
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:36,383
sort of,

69
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,170
you know,

70
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:39,810
way to live their lives
in a very meaningful way.

71
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:42,690
And that hunger was very apparent to me.

72
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:47,850
I didn't realize it was that strong until
actually you came along and I saw the

73
00:02:47,851 --> 00:02:50,670
response to worldwide has been phenomenal.

74
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:53,311
It was something,

75
00:02:53,311 --> 00:02:54,240
I was talking to the,

76
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:57,420
I call them the penguin people
because that's actually quite funny.

77
00:02:57,421 --> 00:03:02,421
But I was talking to the penguin people
today and David asked me how I can

78
00:03:02,921 --> 00:03:05,610
account for what's happened
over the last year,

79
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:06,453
say,

80
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:07,360
and I,

81
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:12,550
my sense essentially is that young people
haven't been talked intelligently to

82
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:17,760
about responsibility and tradition since
like 1965 and that's three generations.

83
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,320
It's way too long.

84
00:03:20,321 --> 00:03:24,070
And so they are starving for it
because we've missed half the story.

85
00:03:24,071 --> 00:03:24,904
You know,

86
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:25,330
people,

87
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:27,400
they've been fed a diet
of nothing but sugar,

88
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:30,040
freedom and impulsive pleasure and,

89
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:31,413
and uh,

90
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:33,070
and cynicism about,

91
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:34,840
about structure and tradition.

92
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:40,260
And you just can't live like that because
freedom and novelty and the unexpected

93
00:03:41,651 --> 00:03:42,520
is half the story.

94
00:03:42,521 --> 00:03:44,980
But structure and predictability
and responsibilities,

95
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:45,701
the other half.

96
00:03:45,701 --> 00:03:46,470
And you,

97
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:47,620
you have to have both,

98
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:49,940
both halves of the story told no,

99
00:03:49,941 --> 00:03:54,941
your detractors are saying that 90% of
your audience is male and most of them

100
00:03:56,141 --> 00:03:57,130
are white male.

101
00:03:57,610 --> 00:04:00,440
I really don't understand why
that's an issue or a private room.

102
00:04:00,441 --> 00:04:01,720
So don't think it's true.

103
00:04:01,721 --> 00:04:02,554
It's funny.

104
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:03,340
Um,

105
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:03,641
you know,

106
00:04:03,641 --> 00:04:07,060
I was going through my Twitter
followers yesterday because I,

107
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:12,150
I'm sending some of the books and I used
a program that helped me identify the

108
00:04:13,271 --> 00:04:14,104
most,

109
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:18,580
sort of a combination of
my most influential Twitter
followers and also those

110
00:04:18,581 --> 00:04:22,330
who are most likely to be
engaged with my material.

111
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:25,780
And so I identified about
200 of them and you know,

112
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:29,080
there was some pretty
right wing types in there.

113
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:30,183
Three or four of them,

114
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:31,060
pretty right wing.

115
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:32,440
Um,

116
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,220
but you know,

117
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:37,540
three of them were a
transsexual porn stars.

118
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:39,100
Really,

119
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:41,620
really interesting because you know,

120
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,470
if you looked at the three
kind of radical right wingers,

121
00:04:44,471 --> 00:04:44,891
you'd say,

122
00:04:44,891 --> 00:04:45,370
well,

123
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:48,580
Dr. Peterson attracts radical
right wing and followers.

124
00:04:48,581 --> 00:04:49,540
But then,

125
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:49,961
well,

126
00:04:49,961 --> 00:04:50,351
okay,

127
00:04:50,351 --> 00:04:53,770
what you're going to say about
the transsexual porn stars,

128
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:56,140
literally there were
three of them thought,

129
00:04:56,141 --> 00:04:56,740
well,

130
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:57,280
what do I,

131
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:00,070
what am I like tarred with the,

132
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:03,850
with the association
transsexual Porn Stars?

133
00:05:03,851 --> 00:05:06,880
Because that seems to be
just as as big a group.

134
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:08,223
So it's just,

135
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:12,160
I think Serina part of what it is is
that if you stand up against the radical

136
00:05:12,161 --> 00:05:12,880
left,

137
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:13,713
let's say,

138
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:18,700
then it isn't obvious where
you're positioned on the
political spectrum because

139
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:22,300
everybody to the right of the radical
left is going to agree with you.

140
00:05:22,301 --> 00:05:24,400
And that'll include people on the radical,

141
00:05:24,401 --> 00:05:25,234
right?

142
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,070
Correct.

143
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:28,360
And then people say,

144
00:05:28,361 --> 00:05:28,481
Oh,

145
00:05:28,481 --> 00:05:28,931
well look,

146
00:05:28,931 --> 00:05:30,740
you've got people on the radical right.

147
00:05:30,741 --> 00:05:31,481
Supporting you.

148
00:05:31,481 --> 00:05:32,650
You must be radical.

149
00:05:32,651 --> 00:05:33,011
Right?

150
00:05:33,011 --> 00:05:34,750
And it's a reasonable question,

151
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:35,613
but,

152
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:38,150
but it's generally not
posed in a reasonable way.

153
00:05:38,151 --> 00:05:38,771
And you know,

154
00:05:38,771 --> 00:05:41,410
you obviously you were
at the free speech rally.

155
00:05:41,411 --> 00:05:42,700
I mean the,

156
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:48,100
there was no evidence whatsoever that
the crowd we attracted was anything other

157
00:05:48,101 --> 00:05:52,720
than pretty damn stable
center of the road.

158
00:05:52,721 --> 00:05:53,290
Citizens.
