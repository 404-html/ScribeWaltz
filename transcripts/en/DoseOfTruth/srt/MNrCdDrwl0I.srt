1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,140
Consciousness is something like an error
detection and rectification system,

2
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:05,063
something like that.

3
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:06,870
And so you can say,

4
00:00:06,871 --> 00:00:07,021
well,

5
00:00:07,021 --> 00:00:10,590
you can practice being conscious because
what that means in some sense is you're

6
00:00:10,591 --> 00:00:12,060
always attending to your errors.

7
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:16,330
Not seems to be a really intelligent
thing to do if you don't take it too far

8
00:00:16,331 --> 00:00:17,730
and collapse yourself.

9
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:20,010
Because if you're always
attending to your errors,

10
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,730
you're always improving
your automated adaptability,

11
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:25,073
something like that,

12
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:25,350
right?

13
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:26,183
Pay Attention,

14
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,950
see if things are working out
the way that you want them to.

15
00:00:28,951 --> 00:00:29,784
And if they're not,

16
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:31,620
modify your,

17
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:32,310
your,

18
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:33,091
your approach,

19
00:00:33,091 --> 00:00:33,870
your perceptions.

20
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:34,111
Okay.

21
00:00:34,111 --> 00:00:39,111
So you've conserved the systems
and the systems emerged to,

22
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:43,740
to solve the problems of the emergent
complexity and you end up at birth with

23
00:00:43,741 --> 00:00:45,180
all of these conserved systems.

24
00:00:45,181 --> 00:00:48,540
And so those would be proclivities
that would enable you to

25
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:54,150
manifest necessary realm
of behaviors in the social,

26
00:00:54,151 --> 00:00:54,721
natural,

27
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:55,650
human environment,

28
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:56,580
something like that.

29
00:00:56,580 --> 00:00:58,560
So you're basically prepared for that.

30
00:00:58,770 --> 00:00:59,011
And I,

31
00:00:59,011 --> 00:01:02,610
I told you I went through what those were
last time and you can break them down

32
00:01:02,611 --> 00:01:03,770
into um,

33
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:07,400
self-maintenance motivations and
self propagation motivations,

34
00:01:07,401 --> 00:01:08,234
something like that.

35
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:09,533
So,

36
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:10,231
okay,

37
00:01:10,231 --> 00:01:12,960
now the question is how did
those manifest themselves?

38
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:14,850
And that's where we get,

39
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:17,400
that's where we can make a shift,

40
00:01:17,401 --> 00:01:22,401
say from evolutionary ideas and
biological ideas to narrative ideas.

41
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:25,040
So I,

42
00:01:25,041 --> 00:01:27,720
I've made the case for
you that you exist within,

43
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:28,620
within this thing.

44
00:01:28,621 --> 00:01:31,740
I've never figured out exactly what to
call it because you can call it a game or

45
00:01:31,741 --> 00:01:33,330
you can call it a frame of reference,

46
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:34,410
which is pretty good one.

47
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,420
Or you can call it a story.

48
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:37,260
Um,

49
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:39,350
or you can call it a unit of perception.

50
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:39,780
But it,

51
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:42,120
that's not exactly right cause
it's more than perception.

52
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:43,043
It's really this,

53
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:46,230
it's a really what it is
is a micro personality.

54
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:47,281
It's,

55
00:01:47,281 --> 00:01:48,210
it's your,

56
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:51,570
it's your personality as
it manifests itself at it,

57
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:53,460
at the highest possible resolution.

58
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:54,323
That's what this is.

59
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:55,830
And so if I'm,

60
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:56,960
you know,

61
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:01,960
let's say I set myself the task of
moving those keys from there to here.

62
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:06,450
So my perceptual frame is,

63
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:08,543
it's this thing,

64
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:09,120
I think,

65
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,230
well what's the world?

66
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:12,750
Everything else can be ignored.

67
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:16,710
I need to make an object out of my hand,

68
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,110
these keys,

69
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:21,450
that tiny spot on the table.

70
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:22,171
And,

71
00:02:22,171 --> 00:02:27,171
and my goal is to transform
this pattern into that pattern.

72
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:32,340
And it's a pattern because it
maintains itself across time,

73
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:33,151
right?

74
00:02:33,151 --> 00:02:34,980
It's not like smoke or cloud.

75
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:36,060
It persists.

76
00:02:36,061 --> 00:02:37,440
So there it is.

77
00:02:37,441 --> 00:02:37,981
There it is.

78
00:02:37,981 --> 00:02:38,521
There it is.

79
00:02:38,521 --> 00:02:39,300
There it is.

80
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:41,400
That's a pattern that's
extending across time.

81
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,040
So I have this goal,

82
00:02:44,041 --> 00:02:47,490
which is the transformation of
this into that and that goal.

83
00:02:47,491 --> 00:02:49,320
So that would be roughly speaking,

84
00:02:49,321 --> 00:02:50,520
the goal is point B.

85
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:54,630
But you can't just think about this as
something that's a goal because it isn't

86
00:02:54,631 --> 00:02:55,464
just a goal.

87
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:57,540
There's a goal,

88
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,070
which is the end,

89
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:00,640
which is the end state

90
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:03,630
of this entire process.

91
00:03:03,631 --> 00:03:04,830
The End State is,

92
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,620
I've moved the thing from here to here.

93
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:12,760
I've transformed this into this
and I've done it using action.

94
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:13,660
And that's,

95
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:15,370
so that's a useful thing to know too.

96
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:18,010
I have an abstract notion.

97
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:23,700
That's my decision that I'm going to
get the world to manifest this pattern

98
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:26,290
instead of this one.

99
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:27,491
Okay?

100
00:03:27,491 --> 00:03:28,810
So that gives me my target.

101
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:30,243
Okay,

102
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,050
that's an abstraction.

103
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:32,461
Good,

104
00:03:32,461 --> 00:03:33,294
good.

105
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:35,890
But when I actually do the transformation,

106
00:03:35,891 --> 00:03:39,940
that's not an abstraction because
now I'm using actual action,

107
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,170
actual behavior.

108
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:44,380
And so I take this
abstract micro personality.

109
00:03:44,381 --> 00:03:48,100
This is the part that's operating on
this tiny little section of the world.

110
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:51,070
I make the transformation
and as soon as I do that,

111
00:03:51,071 --> 00:03:51,910
another thing happens,

112
00:03:51,911 --> 00:03:53,620
which is I don't need that anymore.

113
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:54,220
Right?

114
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:55,690
I moved to the next one of those,

115
00:03:55,691 --> 00:03:56,890
whatever it happens to be.

116
00:03:57,220 --> 00:04:00,130
And so one of the things we're going
to have to figure out is what is the

117
00:04:00,131 --> 00:04:01,930
relationship between these things?

118
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:04,750
Because you're always in one
of them and they're scalable.

119
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:07,120
So like when you're
doing a specific action,

120
00:04:07,121 --> 00:04:11,050
it's really high resolution and that's
kind of where you want to be operating.

121
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:13,210
When you know what you're doing,

122
00:04:13,211 --> 00:04:14,530
that's where you want to be operating,

123
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:15,483
roughly speaking,

124
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:17,800
when you're trying to do something new,

125
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:19,000
but it's scalable.

126
00:04:19,330 --> 00:04:24,330
And so that's the framework
which is constructed in
part from these motivational

127
00:04:25,241 --> 00:04:26,710
systems that he merged over.

128
00:04:26,711 --> 00:04:27,910
Evolutionary history.

129
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:30,760
The framework specifies
the current condition,

130
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:32,350
the desired condition,

131
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:36,100
and am the behavioral manifestations
that are necessary to make the

132
00:04:36,101 --> 00:04:36,934
transformation.

133
00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:41,500
And so you can't think about it as a drive
cause its instincts are often thought

134
00:04:41,501 --> 00:04:43,330
about is drives or as a goal.

135
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:48,750
It's not correct because the thing
actually determines your perceptions.

136
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:52,740
It determines what objects manifest
themselves to you in the world or,

137
00:04:52,741 --> 00:04:53,590
or what patterns.

138
00:04:53,591 --> 00:04:54,790
That's another way of thinking about it.

139
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:56,350
Cause like when I'm looking at this,

140
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:57,130
it,

141
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:59,290
it's hard to watch your own perceptions.

142
00:04:59,291 --> 00:05:00,580
But when I'm looking at this,

143
00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:02,523
I really,

144
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,640
I can see that chair.

145
00:05:03,641 --> 00:05:04,810
But if I didn't know it was a chair,

146
00:05:04,811 --> 00:05:06,360
I wouldn't be able to tell by looking by,

147
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:07,720
by my visual input,

148
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,430
I can kind of see this one.

149
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:11,960
Okay.

150
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,790
Although I really can't
tell what color it is.

151
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:16,190
That one slightly clearer.

152
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:17,840
This is pretty blurry here.

153
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:19,400
Like I can't see my fingers.

154
00:05:19,401 --> 00:05:20,480
If I'm looking at the keys,

155
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:23,150
I can't see my fingers unless they move.

156
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:24,861
And I'm very,

157
00:05:24,861 --> 00:05:25,820
very focused on that.

158
00:05:25,821 --> 00:05:29,810
So what happens is that all the rest of
the world turns into a low resolution

159
00:05:29,811 --> 00:05:32,360
representations that
vanishes on its periphery.

160
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:34,860
The resolution increases as uh,

161
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,730
as I moved towards the central
part of my visual field.

162
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:41,420
And here it's sharp enough so that I can
actually see the letters on that key.

163
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:43,783
So,

164
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:45,230
so my desire,

165
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:47,870
which I am indicating
by the point of my eyes,

166
00:05:47,871 --> 00:05:52,070
is specifying the objects that I see and
specifying their level of resolution.

167
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:55,040
So you can't just call
that a drive or a goal.

168
00:05:55,041 --> 00:05:55,321
It's,

169
00:05:55,321 --> 00:05:55,610
it's,

170
00:05:55,610 --> 00:05:56,443
that's not right.

171
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:57,320
It's,

172
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:00,680
it's the mechanism that makes
the world manifest itself to you.

173
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:01,880
So that's,

174
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:02,211
that's,

175
00:06:02,211 --> 00:06:02,720
uh,

176
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:06,500
unbelievably crazy thing is that the
world manifest itself to you in keeping

177
00:06:06,501 --> 00:06:07,334
with your goals.

178
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:07,911
Now,

179
00:06:07,911 --> 00:06:12,650
that doesn't mean that you can make the
world do any old thing because it pushes

180
00:06:12,651 --> 00:06:13,071
back,

181
00:06:13,071 --> 00:06:13,281
right?

182
00:06:13,281 --> 00:06:14,510
It objects to you.

183
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:15,441
So,

184
00:06:15,441 --> 00:06:16,101
but still,

185
00:06:16,101 --> 00:06:16,600
it's,

186
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,190
it's very strange thing that,

187
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:19,633
okay,

188
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:21,231
so fine.

189
00:06:21,231 --> 00:06:24,320
So it specifies your perceptions,

190
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,393
your target,

191
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:30,320
the current reality and the likely
procedure that you're going to use to make

192
00:06:30,321 --> 00:06:31,370
all of that interrelated.

193
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:32,690
But it does more than that.

194
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:33,950
So let's,

195
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:34,310
we're gonna,

196
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:36,470
we're gonna look at it from a
couple of different perspectives.

197
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:37,820
So the classic

198
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:44,060
and archaic way of thinking
about perception has the
world's full of objects.

199
00:06:44,061 --> 00:06:44,871
You see the objects,

200
00:06:44,871 --> 00:06:45,531
you think about them,

201
00:06:45,531 --> 00:06:46,351
you evaluate them.

202
00:06:46,351 --> 00:06:47,210
And then you act on them.

203
00:06:47,211 --> 00:06:47,511
It's like,

204
00:06:47,511 --> 00:06:47,781
no,

205
00:06:47,781 --> 00:06:48,740
that isn't how it works.

206
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:49,191
First of all,

207
00:06:49,191 --> 00:06:50,780
the world is not made out of objects.

208
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:52,310
The world is made out of.

209
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:57,410
I think the world is made out of tools
and obstacles and it's because you can't

210
00:06:57,411 --> 00:07:01,280
not perceive the world in relationship
to you and what you perceive actually or

211
00:07:01,281 --> 00:07:04,650
the meaning of objects
you perceive the patterns.

212
00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:09,710
A tool is something like a meaningful
pattern or useful pattern in something

213
00:07:09,711 --> 00:07:10,131
like that.

214
00:07:10,131 --> 00:07:10,850
And so look,

215
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:12,200
look again,

216
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,273
you look at,

217
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,600
I might say to someone
described this room,

218
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,060
now you're going to pick,

219
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:24,320
you're going to pick a level of
description that's very particular.

220
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:27,170
You're going to pick one that other
human beings could understand.

221
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:29,870
So it's going to be
predicated on an on your size,

222
00:07:29,871 --> 00:07:30,471
for example.

223
00:07:30,471 --> 00:07:33,410
And so you're going to be predicated on
your knowledge that that other person is

224
00:07:33,411 --> 00:07:38,330
a lot like you and has a lot of the same
underlying structures and motivations.

225
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:38,860
So,

226
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:41,030
and that's an implicit
predicate of your description.

227
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:41,811
So we're going to say,

228
00:07:41,811 --> 00:07:42,231
well,

229
00:07:42,231 --> 00:07:43,940
it's kind of an ordinary classroom.

230
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:49,150
It's got 20 rows of tables that each
have five chairs at it and each of them

231
00:07:50,421 --> 00:07:50,691
does,

232
00:07:50,691 --> 00:07:51,590
has five chairs.

233
00:07:51,591 --> 00:07:53,180
There's some posts that hold them up.

234
00:07:53,530 --> 00:07:54,170
Um,

235
00:07:54,170 --> 00:07:55,490
there's a couple of speakers.

236
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:56,540
There's a podium,

237
00:07:56,541 --> 00:07:57,560
there's a screen,

238
00:07:57,561 --> 00:07:59,270
there's some additional chairs,

239
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:00,800
there's a scattering of people.

240
00:08:00,801 --> 00:08:02,360
There are some electronic equipment.

241
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:04,400
And so you know,

242
00:08:04,401 --> 00:08:07,100
of course that there's an infinite
number of things I could be describing in

243
00:08:07,101 --> 00:08:07,934
this room.

244
00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:08,481
Right?

245
00:08:08,481 --> 00:08:09,680
Like I could be describing,

246
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:12,800
there's a lot of color
variation in that tile.

247
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:14,000
So if I look at it,

248
00:08:14,001 --> 00:08:18,350
I can see that it's unlike the other
tiles because the light is reflecting off

249
00:08:18,370 --> 00:08:18,800
it.

250
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,570
So it's got a shiny white element.

251
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:21,583
There's about,

252
00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:26,000
God only knows a million different
scratches in it each which are unique.

253
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,490
I can't even really tell what color it is.

254
00:08:28,570 --> 00:08:31,010
It kind of looks like
an off grayish green.

255
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:35,120
But if I was painting it to get
a reasonable representation,

256
00:08:35,121 --> 00:08:40,121
I'd had to have to have at least six or
seven shades of green ranging from quite

257
00:08:41,841 --> 00:08:43,160
dark to almost white.

258
00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:46,100
And that's only if I look at it from here.

259
00:08:46,101 --> 00:08:47,420
If I look at it from here,

260
00:08:48,050 --> 00:08:49,580
well then you get the point,

261
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:49,881
right?

262
00:08:49,881 --> 00:08:53,180
I mean there is an infinite
number of details in this room.

263
00:08:53,210 --> 00:08:55,650
There's an infinite number
of facts in this room.

264
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:59,460
That's also why I don't believe
that you can derive an art form.

265
00:08:59,461 --> 00:09:00,294
It is,

266
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:01,340
it's like,

267
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:01,650
you know,

268
00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:03,060
that's the old humean issue,

269
00:09:03,061 --> 00:09:03,301
right?

270
00:09:03,301 --> 00:09:06,570
You cannot derive ethical
guidelines from factual knowledge.

271
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:10,900
And I think the reason for that
is which facts are going to pick?

272
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:13,660
How are you going to select them?

273
00:09:13,930 --> 00:09:14,710
There's,

274
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:16,420
there's an infinite number of them,

275
00:09:16,421 --> 00:09:18,070
even in a constrained situation.

276
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:23,290
So merely by attending to some
and not attending to others,

277
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:28,380
you're already using an ethic because
you can't attend to one thing and not

278
00:09:28,691 --> 00:09:32,110
another without being ensconced
in one of these value structures.

279
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:35,380
Because the value structure
is what determines the
direction of your attention.

280
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:39,460
And so you can't make the
argument that you're using the,

281
00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:44,620
the infinite number of facts that are
available at your disposal to govern how

282
00:09:44,621 --> 00:09:45,850
you're looking at the facts.

283
00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:46,600
You're not,

284
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,530
that isn't what you're doing.

285
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:49,060
It's not possible to do that.

286
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:50,410
So what do you do?

287
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:51,723
Well,

288
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:56,080
you described the things in the room
that would be relevant to other people.

289
00:09:56,081 --> 00:09:58,420
Otherwise you're going to bore them to
death or they're going to think you're

290
00:09:58,421 --> 00:09:59,254
insane,

291
00:09:59,710 --> 00:10:00,071
you know,

292
00:10:00,071 --> 00:10:00,850
so,

293
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:04,240
or an artist maybe because an artist
might do the kind of concentration on a

294
00:10:04,241 --> 00:10:05,590
detail that I just described,

295
00:10:05,591 --> 00:10:06,610
but he's obviously,

296
00:10:06,611 --> 00:10:09,850
or she's obviously trying to paint
the thing are represented somehow.

297
00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:11,380
So it's still tool like,

298
00:10:11,381 --> 00:10:14,440
well why do you want to know
that there are tables while,

299
00:10:14,441 --> 00:10:15,274
cause you said at the,

300
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,750
why do you want to know
if there are chairs?

301
00:10:16,751 --> 00:10:18,070
Because you sit in them.

302
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:18,850
No,

303
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:22,990
what about the screen or the camera
equipment while they're all usable tools.

304
00:10:23,530 --> 00:10:24,970
And so that's what you described.

305
00:10:24,971 --> 00:10:29,140
You described the world at the level
of usable tool or you might also say,

306
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:30,413
um,

307
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:30,910
you know,

308
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:33,520
look out for that girl who's
third in the third row,

309
00:10:33,521 --> 00:10:34,354
she's trouble.

310
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:39,800
And so you might call out
someone if you're describing
the room because there is

311
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:42,700
somewhere in that room that if you go,

312
00:10:42,701 --> 00:10:44,110
you're going to get into trouble.

313
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:45,520
And so and so.

314
00:10:45,521 --> 00:10:47,920
Those are sort of the things
that seem to me to be relevant.

315
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:50,500
There are tools that
move you along your way.

316
00:10:50,501 --> 00:10:51,430
Facilitators,

317
00:10:51,431 --> 00:10:54,700
that's another way of thinking about
that and there are obstacles that get in

318
00:10:54,701 --> 00:10:58,180
your way and there's a tiny set of those.

319
00:10:58,420 --> 00:10:59,620
Otherwise you get overwhelmed.

320
00:10:59,621 --> 00:11:02,290
You're not going to go anywhere
where it's all obstacles,

321
00:11:02,650 --> 00:11:02,950
right?

322
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:03,783
You don't even mind.

323
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:05,800
You don't want to be in that place.

324
00:11:05,830 --> 00:11:08,890
You want to be at a place where
it's mostly this and then,

325
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:09,970
then there's a,

326
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:11,320
the biggest category though,

327
00:11:11,321 --> 00:11:12,490
this is what's cool,

328
00:11:12,850 --> 00:11:13,241
this is,

329
00:11:13,241 --> 00:11:14,440
and this is so important,

330
00:11:15,130 --> 00:11:19,960
is the biggest perceptual category is
that which is not relevant at this time

331
00:11:20,770 --> 00:11:22,120
because it contains everything.

332
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:22,691
You know,

333
00:11:22,691 --> 00:11:23,350
like when you're,

334
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:24,400
when you're writing on this,

335
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:25,360
on this pad,

336
00:11:27,130 --> 00:11:31,300
you assumed the entire world around you
is constant and therefore you can ignore

337
00:11:31,301 --> 00:11:31,660
it.

338
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:33,250
It's everything out there.

339
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:35,560
All the transformations
that are taking place,

340
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:40,800
you turned to zero and you just focus
on maybe the space that's occupied by a

341
00:11:41,561 --> 00:11:42,520
single letter.

342
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:46,420
The whole world Trinks down to just that
single letter and everything else is

343
00:11:46,421 --> 00:11:47,254
ignored.

344
00:11:47,530 --> 00:11:47,711
Well,

345
00:11:47,711 --> 00:11:49,360
what happens if something goes wrong?

346
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:50,350
This is the thing.

347
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:51,730
This is why this is important.

348
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:53,590
What happens if something goes wrong?

349
00:11:54,530 --> 00:11:59,530
An indeterminate set of those irrelevant
entities has now become relevant.

350
00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:04,270
That's the problem is the
invisibility disappears.

351
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:05,201
And so,

352
00:12:05,201 --> 00:12:05,980
for example.
