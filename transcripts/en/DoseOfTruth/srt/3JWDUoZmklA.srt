1
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:08,770
Well,
when you delve into the literature on

2
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:10,960
Judaism,
Christianity and Islam and their

3
00:00:10,961 --> 00:00:14,590
versions of the afterlife and heaven,
they're quite different in the Jews are

4
00:00:14,591 --> 00:00:17,860
far less obsessed with going some place
after death.

5
00:00:17,861 --> 00:00:19,390
In fact,
originally they had.

6
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:23,290
They were going no place at all.
Shell was just nothing.

7
00:00:23,291 --> 00:00:25,510
It was just.
He returned to where you were before.

8
00:00:25,511 --> 00:00:27,880
You're allowed just no place,
uh,

9
00:00:27,881 --> 00:00:29,650
and so,
so that,

10
00:00:29,651 --> 00:00:32,180
that religion is far more focused on the
here and now.

11
00:00:32,181 --> 00:00:34,500
Like we have a moral duty to help
people,

12
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:39,580
the poor and so on now and to live
better lives and more lives of dignity

13
00:00:39,581 --> 00:00:44,581
and honor and let now and at
Christianity really started off more

14
00:00:44,801 --> 00:00:47,260
like that.
Then kind of morphed over the centuries

15
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:51,460
and it particularly in fundamentalist
and evangelicals in the 20th century

16
00:00:51,461 --> 00:00:55,020
toward this place.
We're going to go right now.

17
00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:57,310
Yeah.
You kind of had the schism in

18
00:00:57,311 --> 00:01:00,310
Christianity today between the kind of
the,

19
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:04,990
the fundamentalists that are constantly
talking about the afterlife and

20
00:01:05,020 --> 00:01:07,480
accepting Jesus and they're focused on
missionary,

21
00:01:07,481 --> 00:01:11,230
working into birding people versus say
maybe the Rick Warren's of the world

22
00:01:11,231 --> 00:01:15,520
that want to put their money into a soup
kitchens and helping the poor and,

23
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:16,251
and,
and,

24
00:01:16,251 --> 00:01:21,251
and Christians have a moral duty to help
those in need and not so much focused on

25
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:24,010
the next life.

26
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:24,883
And yeah,

27
00:01:25,610 --> 00:01:28,610
it's funny because there,
there are real dangers associated with

28
00:01:28,611 --> 00:01:33,500
both those kinds of conceptualizations
mean you alluded to one danger that was

29
00:01:33,501 --> 00:01:36,320
associated with,
let's call those who are concerned more

30
00:01:36,321 --> 00:01:40,550
with the immediate present.
And that's the starting to manifest

31
00:01:40,551 --> 00:01:42,050
itself in these,
in these,

32
00:01:42,051 --> 00:01:45,440
um,
technological immortalists.

33
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:46,790
They're saying,
well,

34
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:50,960
we should transform the nature of being
extraordinarily radically right here and

35
00:01:50,961 --> 00:01:53,150
now so that we have heaven in
immortality here.

36
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:54,111
You think,
well,

37
00:01:54,111 --> 00:01:55,940
what do we lose by doing that?
You know,

38
00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:00,440
that's the question that's really worth
asking because if we're transhuman then

39
00:02:00,441 --> 00:02:03,380
we lose being human.
And it may be that we actually don't

40
00:02:03,381 --> 00:02:06,440
want to lose being human.
Even though being human means suffering

41
00:02:06,441 --> 00:02:08,000
and malevolent,
something like that,

42
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:11,060
it's a very hard question,
but then the Christians,

43
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:13,240
this is what we need.
She went after the Christian.

44
00:02:13,241 --> 00:02:14,900
Since it's such an ax.
He said,

45
00:02:14,901 --> 00:02:19,250
well,
if you despise the current world and you

46
00:02:19,251 --> 00:02:21,950
leave everything to be rectified in the
afterlife,

47
00:02:21,951 --> 00:02:25,190
then you just abandoned life itself and
you're really trainers to life.

48
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:30,250
How,
how to steer through those to shoot two

49
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:33,170
shows,
let's say is thing or to cliff's.

50
00:02:33,171 --> 00:02:34,850
That's a very difficult proposition.

51
00:02:35,570 --> 00:02:36,610
Well,
it's the message.

52
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:41,180
My message in the book to,
to the military eons and the cryonics

53
00:02:41,181 --> 00:02:45,740
and transhumanism and so on is I'm glad
you're working on this problem.

54
00:02:45,741 --> 00:02:47,700
You know,
but because I say to Schermer don't you

55
00:02:47,701 --> 00:02:51,320
want to live to be a thousand years and
my response is look,

56
00:02:51,321 --> 00:02:56,321
just get me the 90 without cancer and
100 without Alzheimer's and 110 without

57
00:02:56,931 --> 00:02:58,910
being plugged into machines and lying in
a.

58
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:01,120
because that's not alive.
And

59
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:06,130
so I'm glad people are working on like,
what's the best diet,

60
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:10,480
how much?
What can we do to improve our memory?

61
00:03:10,481 --> 00:03:11,291
And so on.
That's all.

62
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:15,780
Great,
and I'm glad and I'm glad Kurzweil is

63
00:03:15,781 --> 00:03:19,390
now the chief engineer of all Google.
I mean he's got some resources to do

64
00:03:19,391 --> 00:03:23,050
something about this,
but that this focus on living a thousand

65
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:25,840
years,
your first one you may miss the little

66
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:29,080
incremental things we can do,
but also you're missing out now.

67
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:33,550
There's this fell in my right about,
in the book I'm on Ray Kurzweil.

68
00:03:33,551 --> 00:03:35,650
It's a little kind of biographical film
of him,

69
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:39,850
a transcendent man and he's constantly
talking about,

70
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:42,220
you know,
living forever and so on and he's

71
00:03:42,221 --> 00:03:45,820
obsessed with his father.
His father died when he was 51.

72
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:50,650
The father was 51 and,
and ray was kind of missed out having a

73
00:03:50,651 --> 00:03:54,740
father figure because the father was
always working and ray was a,

74
00:03:54,741 --> 00:03:55,210
you know,
a,

75
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:58,300
a real entrepreneur achiever from his
teenage years.

76
00:03:58,301 --> 00:04:02,290
So he was always working and the film
kind of follows him around collecting

77
00:04:02,291 --> 00:04:05,110
everything he can about his father and
he keeps it in the basement of his house

78
00:04:05,111 --> 00:04:08,350
and he wants to resurrect his father and
a computer and it's like,

79
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:08,741
Whoa,
boy.

80
00:04:08,741 --> 00:04:12,130
Freud would have a field day with this
Indian guy,

81
00:04:12,131 --> 00:04:14,050
but there's something,
there's something going on there.

82
00:04:14,051 --> 00:04:15,700
This sort of rose,
you know,

83
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:20,410
I see this,
this strange dichotomy and attitude that

84
00:04:20,411 --> 00:04:23,920
you just described.
Even characterizing use that in my own

85
00:04:23,921 --> 00:04:28,750
life because I'm very interested in
technologies that stave off aging,

86
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:32,590
dietary manipulations,
and I have this machine in my basement

87
00:04:32,591 --> 00:04:36,700
that's intense pulse light,
late intense pulse light machine that's

88
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:40,510
unbelievable skin rejuvenator.
It's an absolute miracle.

89
00:04:40,511 --> 00:04:43,360
This machine.
And it'll take,

90
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:46,450
it'll take sun damage from your skin
completely.

91
00:04:46,451 --> 00:04:48,940
And forced rejuvenation.
It's like,

92
00:04:48,941 --> 00:04:51,460
it's just like using photoshop on your
skin.

93
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:53,200
It's amazing.
And,

94
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:53,780
but,
um,

95
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:55,030
but,
and so I think,

96
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:57,670
well,
isn't it interesting to do everything

97
00:04:57,671 --> 00:05:02,080
possible to prolong youth in life?
But at the same time there's another

98
00:05:02,081 --> 00:05:05,110
part of me that's thinking,
well,

99
00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:10,300
this is something I wrote about it in
this new book that I'm publishing.

100
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:14,950
I'm just thinking about socrates and his
ability to accept his death.

101
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:18,340
No.
And what socrates seems to have revealed

102
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:22,450
in his acceptance of his death was that
if you live your life properly,

103
00:05:22,451 --> 00:05:24,130
then you may be.

104
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:28,090
You lived your life in some sense,
you've exhausted it in some sense.

105
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:32,230
The question is if you,
if you lived a thousand years,

106
00:05:32,231 --> 00:05:33,670
well,
what exactly,

107
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:37,180
what exactly would you do?
You know,

108
00:05:37,181 --> 00:05:40,000
like I've had kids and I loved having
kids,

109
00:05:40,001 --> 00:05:42,640
but I wouldn't have them again.
Like I wouldn't do that again,

110
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:45,520
I don't think.
And I have a grandchild and that's fine,

111
00:05:45,521 --> 00:05:49,750
but that's a new thing.
Like I've had a career and I as I get

112
00:05:49,751 --> 00:05:53,080
older,
the idea of having 10 more careers

113
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:57,170
seems.
It's not like I'm not interested in it,

114
00:05:57,171 --> 00:06:01,640
but it doesn't grip me the same way that
it would have say 20 years ago.

115
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:07,230
And so I wonder like I wonder if it is
the case that life is in some sense

116
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:12,050
structured so that its finitude as
necessary and not something that should

117
00:06:12,051 --> 00:06:16,010
be well casually transcended.
Let's say.
