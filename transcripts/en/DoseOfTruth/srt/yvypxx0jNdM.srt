1
00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:01,383
Yeah,

2
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:13,980
I increases she not to
be coming from music.

3
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:18,060
You had intense
environmental interventions.

4
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:22,290
We should consider the possibility
that these differences have a genetic

5
00:00:22,291 --> 00:00:23,124
component.

6
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:29,060
And that really began the incendiary
descent of intelligent search to the

7
00:00:30,991 --> 00:00:31,824
periphery,

8
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:35,190
to the reaction against
that was universal.

9
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:36,403
Uh,

10
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:39,210
because it implied inferiority,

11
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:39,900
if you believe,

12
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:41,000
it seems like

13
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:43,810
it's also something
that's universally hated,

14
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:46,180
but on both sides of
the political spectrum.

15
00:00:46,181 --> 00:00:48,040
Because on the liberal end,

16
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:48,581
you know,

17
00:00:48,581 --> 00:00:50,120
the idea of fundamentally is,

18
00:00:50,121 --> 00:00:51,970
is that everybody's the same.

19
00:00:51,971 --> 00:00:52,780
And that if you,

20
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:54,580
if you distribute education,

21
00:00:54,581 --> 00:00:55,121
resources,

22
00:00:55,121 --> 00:00:55,541
property,

23
00:00:55,541 --> 00:00:56,950
then everyone can succeed.

24
00:00:57,460 --> 00:00:59,470
And so that didn't work
out so well for liberals.

25
00:00:59,471 --> 00:01:00,670
And then on the conservative side,

26
00:01:00,671 --> 00:01:01,510
the idea is,

27
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:02,051
well,

28
00:01:02,051 --> 00:01:04,870
if you could just get off your
lazy ass is and get a job,

29
00:01:04,871 --> 00:01:06,370
there is a job for you out there.
