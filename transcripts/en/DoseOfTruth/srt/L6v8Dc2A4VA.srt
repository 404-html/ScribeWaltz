1
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:10,190
So we were talking about
your treatment at the hands,

2
00:00:10,191 --> 00:00:10,581
let's say,

3
00:00:10,581 --> 00:00:11,620
of Western feminists.

4
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:13,580
And like I read infidel,

5
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:15,080
I dunno,

6
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:16,700
very shortly after you published it,

7
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:16,941
which,

8
00:00:16,941 --> 00:00:17,430
and I,

9
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:18,500
I love that book man.

10
00:00:18,501 --> 00:00:19,790
As soon as I read that I thought,

11
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:20,570
well,

12
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:21,460
I used,

13
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:25,480
yeah.

14
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:26,990
And I thought it was remarkable.

15
00:00:26,991 --> 00:00:31,991
I thought your comment on your comments
on viewing Western culture from the

16
00:00:32,361 --> 00:00:36,520
perspective of an immigrant that was
how refer for genuine education and,

17
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:38,390
and your comments on your,

18
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:42,470
your experience with the
efficiency of the Dutch state say,

19
00:00:42,471 --> 00:00:44,570
and you're sort of amazement
at how well it worked.

20
00:00:44,571 --> 00:00:45,260
That was just,

21
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:49,160
I thought that was so remarkable and
clearheaded and I thought when I read

22
00:00:49,161 --> 00:00:49,971
infidel I thought,

23
00:00:49,971 --> 00:00:50,660
well,

24
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:54,110
this woman is immediately going to be
a hero to feminists everywhere because

25
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:57,980
she's removed himself from this oppressive
state and moved out into the world

26
00:00:57,981 --> 00:00:59,510
and become a powerful figure when,

27
00:00:59,511 --> 00:01:01,400
what was the probability of that?

28
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:02,390
It was like zero,

29
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:03,200
you know,

30
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:06,920
and that you suffered as a consequence
of your beliefs and you stood up

31
00:01:06,921 --> 00:01:07,880
forthrightly for them.

32
00:01:07,881 --> 00:01:11,600
And I thought if you wanted to find a
feminist hero that you're certainly,

33
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:12,970
you're,

34
00:01:12,970 --> 00:01:15,470
you're certainly in the
running man for exactly that.

35
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,750
And then to see how you've been treated.

36
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:19,100
It's just,

37
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:19,700
I just,

38
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:21,230
it just makes my jaw drop.

39
00:01:21,231 --> 00:01:22,190
You know that your dis,

40
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:23,920
especially what Brandeis did,

41
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:27,200
it was Brandeis right where you were
offered an honorary phd and then they

42
00:01:27,201 --> 00:01:28,034
revoked it.

43
00:01:28,370 --> 00:01:29,203
That just,

44
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:30,470
that was one of the,

45
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,540
I think that was almost as reprehensible,

46
00:01:32,541 --> 00:01:37,541
inactive cowardice as the West's basic
abandonment of Solomon Rushdie after the

47
00:01:38,631 --> 00:01:38,911
fat,

48
00:01:38,911 --> 00:01:41,780
what was put on his head
and about equally dangerous.

49
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:43,370
So

50
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:44,450
it was multicultural.

51
00:01:44,451 --> 00:01:44,840
I mean,

52
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:45,673
what I,

53
00:01:46,010 --> 00:01:46,843
you know,

54
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:47,781
my message,

55
00:01:47,781 --> 00:01:48,860
my life story,

56
00:01:48,861 --> 00:01:49,694
who I am,

57
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:53,420
it's a defiance of the
prevalent trends of today.

58
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:54,950
It's against the law.

59
00:01:55,730 --> 00:02:00,730
I believe that Western values as superior
to Islamic law and Islamic values,

60
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:07,620
not to say that is to blast being in
the temples of multiculturalism today.

61
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:09,273
And so I think,

62
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:14,390
I hope we did a lot of people because
it wasn't about what they think should

63
00:02:14,391 --> 00:02:18,050
happen for victims of misogyny.

64
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:22,450
I think it's all about the
dissonance that my words and my,

65
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:25,130
my life and my beliefs,

66
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:28,610
the kind of decisions
they put these women in.

67
00:02:28,611 --> 00:02:31,190
Because if you're going or I'll say,

68
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:35,540
well it's horrible to be an American
woman and then the surgeon in America is

69
00:02:35,541 --> 00:02:36,374
worse than that.

70
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:40,190
No it's not right yet.

71
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:41,610
I,

72
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:43,520
I'm sort of interfering with their,

73
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:44,443
with their worldview.

74
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:48,780
The claim that you're making there is
something like this and it's really,

75
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:52,950
it's a really vicious claim in a sense
and it's something like the western

76
00:02:52,951 --> 00:02:57,390
feminists who are possessed
by postmodernism and cultural
relativism are willing

77
00:02:57,391 --> 00:03:02,391
to sacrifice the freedom and equality of
third world women in places like Saudi

78
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:07,330
Arabia to maintain the sanctity of
their multicultural notion because that

79
00:03:07,331 --> 00:03:12,220
justifies their attack on western
patriarchy they're willing to use.

80
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:13,330
Okay,

81
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:13,811
so that,

82
00:03:13,811 --> 00:03:15,140
that's an absolute pause.

83
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:16,950
Oh immigration.

84
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:22,160
There are so many men who are coming
from these societies that at us men that

85
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,690
they're not used to the equality of

86
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:28,140
women inside the West.

87
00:03:28,141 --> 00:03:30,030
First of all they're all women,

88
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,260
child marriages,

89
00:03:31,261 --> 00:03:32,880
female genital mutilation,

90
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:33,773
honor killings.

91
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:38,930
But now we have these crepes and sexual
harassment of non Muslim women and these

92
00:03:40,561 --> 00:03:45,561
women keep on arguing for more
integration and they didn't hear anything

93
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:49,680
negative about some of the
negative impacts of immigration.

94
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:52,290
I don't consider them feminists anymore.

95
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:54,410
I think that there are so much more uh,

96
00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:57,290
committed to preserving their world view,

97
00:03:57,291 --> 00:04:00,480
their post modernist worldview
than they are to the heights of

98
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:02,360
well that's what it looks.

99
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,540
I mean I think like that,

100
00:04:04,541 --> 00:04:08,690
that's how it looks to me is like this
is the situation with Saudi Arabia is the

101
00:04:08,691 --> 00:04:10,490
one is the test case is like,

102
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:15,350
so you might say are the postmodern
feminists types are the ones who present

103
00:04:15,351 --> 00:04:15,980
themselves as that,

104
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:19,940
are they more concerned with the rights
of women or are they more concerned with

105
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:22,430
bringing down the so
called tyranny of the West?

106
00:04:22,431 --> 00:04:25,190
And the answer is they're more concerned
with the ladder than they are with the

107
00:04:25,191 --> 00:04:25,551
former.

108
00:04:25,551 --> 00:04:27,200
Because when you put them head to head,

109
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:30,860
those dispense with the rights
of women across the world.

110
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:34,850
As long as they can maintain their moral
justification for the radical bleeps.

111
00:04:34,851 --> 00:04:37,430
And I do think that is why they
go after you because you're,

112
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:42,700
you're exactly the reprehensible exemplar
of what it is that they're attempting

113
00:04:43,401 --> 00:04:44,234
to deny,

114
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,193
I would say,

115
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:47,720
and I think that does show
their true motivations.

116
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:49,123
Absolutely.

117
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,140
Out of time.

118
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:53,450
I'm getting a lot of
signals here that I should,

119
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,410
I should hang up now,

120
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:55,741
but I,

121
00:04:55,741 --> 00:05:00,170
I really enjoyed talking to you and I
hope that in some way I've contributed to

122
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:02,270
to the message that you
want to get out of there.

123
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:03,490
You know what,

124
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:04,510
I'll stop with this.

125
00:05:04,511 --> 00:05:06,100
I'll give one 30 seconds.

126
00:05:06,101 --> 00:05:06,934
I'll just tell you what,

127
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,050
what are doing with this?

128
00:05:08,051 --> 00:05:12,580
I mean I have arranged with a group of
moderate Muslims in Canada and some in

129
00:05:12,581 --> 00:05:16,390
the u s as well to start a series of
dialogues like the one that we had today

130
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:21,340
because this isn't really
viciously important problem
and so I want to use this

131
00:05:21,341 --> 00:05:22,420
as the opener for that.

132
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:26,710
I would like to go after this issue of
whether or not a real dialogue could be

133
00:05:26,711 --> 00:05:31,711
begun between the Judeo Christian West
and the Islam world with some hope of not

134
00:05:32,681 --> 00:05:35,920
having all of this devolve into
endless and continual warfare.

135
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:37,150
Because as far as I can tell,

136
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:38,020
that's where it's headed.

137
00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:40,510
Yes.

138
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:41,261
That's where it's headed.

139
00:05:41,261 --> 00:05:41,790
Yeah.

140
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:42,100
Well,

141
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:43,660
I hope we'll get a chance to talk again.

142
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:45,060
Thank you.

143
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:45,790
So,

144
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:46,623
okay.

145
00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:47,503
All right.

146
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:48,850
Yup.

147
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:49,031
Bye.

148
00:05:49,031 --> 00:05:49,510
Bye.

149
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:49,721
Bye.

150
00:05:49,721 --> 00:05:49,960
Bye.
