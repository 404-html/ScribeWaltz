1
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:11,970
I'm concerned about the obsession with
the people obsessing too much about the

2
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:12,630
afterlife,

3
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:13,710
not just religious people,

4
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:14,840
but scientists.

5
00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:15,883
It's what I call it,

6
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:18,600
the afterlife for atheists.

7
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:23,520
The core of my book is really about
all the cryonics people in the

8
00:00:23,521 --> 00:00:24,450
transhumanists,

9
00:00:24,451 --> 00:00:28,830
in the singular Terry ends
and the extropians and the
people that are going to

10
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:31,530
upload your mind into a
computer and turn it off.

11
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:32,221
You know,

12
00:00:32,221 --> 00:00:33,750
ray Kurzweil and all these guys,

13
00:00:33,751 --> 00:00:33,961
you know,

14
00:00:33,961 --> 00:00:34,380
they're,

15
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:36,690
they're almost gurus when
you go to these conferences,

16
00:00:36,691 --> 00:00:36,901
you know,

17
00:00:36,901 --> 00:00:38,130
it's like we get to live forever.

18
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:40,310
We are the generation that gets delivered.

19
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:46,100
They're the generation that's going to
instantiate the daddy in the form of

20
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:48,200
computational entity as well.

21
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:49,111
That's right.

22
00:00:49,111 --> 00:00:49,270
I mean,

23
00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:51,070
Kurzweil even has a funny line about that.

24
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:53,250
Is there a god?

25
00:00:53,251 --> 00:00:53,431
Well,

26
00:00:53,431 --> 00:00:54,720
if there's going to be pretty soon,

27
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:56,010
as soon as we hit the singularity,

28
00:00:57,450 --> 00:01:00,110
and so I've been to
the singularity summit.

29
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:02,340
It reminds me of what I was religious.

30
00:01:02,341 --> 00:01:02,530
You know,

31
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:03,870
I used to be an evangelical,

32
00:01:03,871 --> 00:01:05,190
I went to Pepperdine University,

33
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:06,810
uh,

34
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:08,280
which is a church of Christ school.

35
00:01:08,281 --> 00:01:09,300
I was really into it.

36
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:09,621
And,

37
00:01:09,621 --> 00:01:09,770
uh,

38
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:11,760
and going to church and all that stuff.

39
00:01:11,761 --> 00:01:12,120
And I get,

40
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:13,890
I go to the singularity
summit and it's like,

41
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:14,191
wow,

42
00:01:14,191 --> 00:01:15,060
I'm back in church.

43
00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:20,770
Here's Ray Kurzweil grew up there telling
us we are the first generation that

44
00:01:20,971 --> 00:01:21,840
will live forever.

45
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:22,910
And you know,

46
00:01:22,910 --> 00:01:23,630
operating gray,

47
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:24,930
this radical life extension,

48
00:01:24,931 --> 00:01:25,500
the scientists,

49
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:25,681
you know,

50
00:01:25,681 --> 00:01:25,920
he,

51
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:29,040
he's on record saying the first
person to live a thousand years is,

52
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:30,150
is born now,

53
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:31,410
is this alive now?

54
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:31,861
Right?

55
00:01:31,861 --> 00:01:34,410
So there's two elements to,

56
00:01:34,411 --> 00:01:36,090
they have an issue that
we can discuss them.

57
00:01:36,091 --> 00:01:41,091
And one is the belief in the existence
of heaven and the other is the positing

58
00:01:42,331 --> 00:01:43,480
of heaven as an Ame.

59
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:45,090
Yes,

60
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:45,831
those are interesting.

61
00:01:45,831 --> 00:01:46,651
We related.

62
00:01:46,651 --> 00:01:49,170
So from my perspective from,

63
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:51,810
so one of the things as
far as I'd be able to tell,

64
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:57,210
one of the things that allows
us to transform the reality
that's too complicated

65
00:01:57,211 --> 00:02:01,310
to perceive into these
functional low resolution icon,

66
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:02,010
let's say,

67
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:02,843
is an aim.

68
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:06,300
You have to aim right and you
have to aim with your eyes.

69
00:02:06,301 --> 00:02:06,961
And in fact,

70
00:02:06,961 --> 00:02:10,680
we're also extraordinarily good at
detecting how other people aim with their

71
00:02:10,681 --> 00:02:11,514
eyes.

72
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:16,440
So the question is always,

73
00:02:16,441 --> 00:02:17,840
well where should you aim?

74
00:02:17,841 --> 00:02:20,150
And the answer to that
archetypally I would say,

75
00:02:20,151 --> 00:02:24,150
and biologically for that matter is that
you should aim up because why the hell

76
00:02:24,151 --> 00:02:25,140
would you aim down?

77
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,340
Down is hell.

78
00:02:26,341 --> 00:02:29,790
Right down is where the suffering
is down is where the malevolence is.

79
00:02:29,791 --> 00:02:33,690
So you aim up and
architecturally op is heaven.

80
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:36,420
And so one of the things that I can't,

81
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:40,860
it seems to me that there's
some possibility that it
was impossible for human

82
00:02:40,861 --> 00:02:42,720
beings to discover the future,

83
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:44,520
which is something that
we seem to have done.

84
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:47,380
Maybe that was pre frontal
extension and that was the,

85
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:51,720
the expansion of the prefrontal cortex
and its deep wiring with the visual

86
00:02:51,721 --> 00:02:54,660
cortex that actually enabled
us to foresee the future.

87
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:55,523
Something like that.

88
00:02:55,710 --> 00:03:00,710
I don't know if you can foresee the
future without stumbling upon the idea of

89
00:03:01,301 --> 00:03:02,770
heaven at the same time,

90
00:03:02,771 --> 00:03:04,320
because they haven't,

91
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:05,350
in that sense,

92
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:09,550
becomes the best possible
future and you're aiming out,

93
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:11,650
you're aiming at a better future,

94
00:03:11,651 --> 00:03:13,630
and because you're ending
out a better future,

95
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:17,290
you're kind of compelled to also
conceptualize at least in principle,

96
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,960
like the platonic ideal of the future.

97
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:24,370
And so then that future potential
starts to become kind of a reality.

98
00:03:24,371 --> 00:03:25,450
It's something like that.

99
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:26,491
Yeah,

100
00:03:26,491 --> 00:03:27,690
I think that's a super good point.

101
00:03:27,691 --> 00:03:28,080
My,

102
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:28,341
again,

103
00:03:28,341 --> 00:03:33,060
my concern about obsessing too much about
the next life as you're going to miss

104
00:03:33,061 --> 00:03:34,020
out on this life,

105
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:35,310
which is where you live right now.

106
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:36,510
Uh,

107
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:36,781
but,

108
00:03:36,781 --> 00:03:38,580
but that's different from aiming at it.

109
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:38,960
I mean,

110
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:39,131
you know,

111
00:03:39,131 --> 00:03:39,720
my,

112
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,070
I wrote a book on moral progress,

113
00:03:41,071 --> 00:03:41,904
the moral arc,

114
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:47,150
they mean for incremental improvements
in civil rights and health and longevity

115
00:03:47,491 --> 00:03:48,060
and,

116
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:51,200
and ridding ourselves of disease and war.

117
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:54,840
These are all admirable goals and
we should keep doing that aiming for

118
00:03:54,841 --> 00:03:55,530
something.

119
00:03:55,530 --> 00:03:57,600
And I do like the metaphor up because

120
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,560
maybe it's because we're
a social hierarchical

121
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:02,503
species.

122
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:04,290
I think that's why the pyramids,

123
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:05,430
I believe that.

124
00:04:05,431 --> 00:04:07,590
I think that's what the
pyramids represent with her,

125
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:08,790
with their gold cap.

126
00:04:08,791 --> 00:04:09,061
Right?

127
00:04:09,061 --> 00:04:09,670
It's

128
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:10,503
right.

129
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:13,360
And The Washington monument
does the same thing.

130
00:04:13,361 --> 00:04:14,194
Right?

131
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,240
Or The pyramid of hierarchy
of needs and so on.
