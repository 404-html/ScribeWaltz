1
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:11,460
And then what seems to go along with
that is something like truth in

2
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:14,380
conception and action.
You know,

3
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:19,270
even people like Jacob who are pretty
damn morally ambivalent to begin with,

4
00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:21,940
get hammered a lot by what they go
through.

5
00:00:21,941 --> 00:00:25,540
And what seems to happen is that they're
hammered into some sort of ethical

6
00:00:25,541 --> 00:00:26,380
shape,
right?

7
00:00:26,381 --> 00:00:29,290
So by the mid point of their life's
journey,

8
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:34,460
there are people who are solidly planted
who you can trust and who don't betray

9
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:37,960
being or themselves or their fellow
Matt.

10
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:40,240
And so it's an interesting,
I mean

11
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:47,270
it seems reasonable to me to first
assume that you have to establish a

12
00:00:48,061 --> 00:00:50,010
relationship with something that's
transcendent.

13
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,830
It might even be just the future version
of you.

14
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:58,350
And then second that you have to align
yourself with reality in a truthful

15
00:00:58,351 --> 00:01:00,720
manner.
And that that's your best bet.

16
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:06,800
And
the biblical stories are actually quite

17
00:01:06,801 --> 00:01:10,250
realistic about that too,
because they don't really say that if

18
00:01:10,251 --> 00:01:13,100
you do that,
you're going to be instantly transported

19
00:01:13,101 --> 00:01:15,020
to the promised land.
Like even Moses,

20
00:01:15,021 --> 00:01:16,520
as we'll find out in the accident,
his stories,

21
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:21,740
he never makes it to the promised land.
And so it's not like you're offered

22
00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:24,560
instantaneous,
final redemption.

23
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:27,350
If you move out forthrightly into the
world,

24
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:32,680
establish a faithful relationship with
being and attempt to conduct yourself

25
00:01:33,591 --> 00:01:37,160
with integrity,
but it's your best bet and it might be

26
00:01:37,161 --> 00:01:39,710
good enough.
And even if it's not good enough,

27
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:42,650
it's really preferable to the
alternative,

28
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:45,980
which seems to be something closely akin
to hell,

29
00:01:45,981 --> 00:01:47,420
both personal and social.
