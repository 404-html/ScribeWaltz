1
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:11,510
Are there ever situations where you
should hold your tongue and not speak what

2
00:00:11,511 --> 00:00:12,344
you believe?

3
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:13,243
Yeah.

4
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:13,970
You,

5
00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:15,260
most of the time,

6
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:17,210
look,

7
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:21,140
it's really a tricky thing to figure
out when to say what you have to say.

8
00:00:21,141 --> 00:00:23,390
But I can give you a
couple of rules of thumb.

9
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:27,020
It's a general question name and
I can't list all the situations,

10
00:00:27,021 --> 00:00:28,970
but I can give you some strategic advice.

11
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:30,260
So for example,

12
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:32,150
if someone is,

13
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:34,053
um,

14
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:37,340
has said rude things to you,

15
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:38,353
for example,

16
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:39,830
says a rude thing to you,

17
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:43,100
maybe you shouldn't respond immediately
even though you're very irritated

18
00:00:43,101 --> 00:00:47,660
because maybe that's just an impulsive
response and one that you'll regret when

19
00:00:47,661 --> 00:00:49,160
you make an anger that you'll regret.

20
00:00:49,161 --> 00:00:53,120
And so I would say when you're dealing
with someone and you want to chastise

21
00:00:53,121 --> 00:00:53,720
them,

22
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:56,660
then you should wait for
them to cin three times,

23
00:00:56,661 --> 00:00:56,961
right?

24
00:00:56,961 --> 00:00:59,270
So the first time they're
rude to you think,

25
00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:00,170
oh,

26
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:02,420
well they're probably having a bad day,

27
00:01:02,421 --> 00:01:03,620
or I misunderstood,

28
00:01:03,621 --> 00:01:04,470
or I'm,

29
00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:05,960
I'm rude sometimes too.

30
00:01:05,961 --> 00:01:06,681
And you know,

31
00:01:06,681 --> 00:01:07,520
I'll just let it go.

32
00:01:07,521 --> 00:01:10,040
But you don't forget and you
don't pretend it didn't happen.

33
00:01:10,041 --> 00:01:12,320
And then it happens again.

34
00:01:12,321 --> 00:01:13,154
And you think,

35
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:14,230
okay,

36
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:15,790
well that could still be fluke.

37
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:16,870
That could still be

38
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:18,830
okay.

39
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:20,360
That could still be situational.

40
00:01:20,361 --> 00:01:22,600
So maybe I'll just hold my damn tongue,

41
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:24,110
but I'll remember that.

42
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:24,801
I'll remember.

43
00:01:24,801 --> 00:01:26,540
And then the third time they do it,

44
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:27,440
then you think,

45
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:27,711
no,

46
00:01:27,711 --> 00:01:28,700
no three times.

47
00:01:28,701 --> 00:01:29,481
That's a pattern.

48
00:01:29,481 --> 00:01:31,340
And so then you can go
to them and you can say,

49
00:01:31,341 --> 00:01:32,174
look,

50
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:34,093
this happened.

51
00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:35,510
And then maybe they did die and you say,

52
00:01:35,511 --> 00:01:36,171
well yeah,

53
00:01:36,171 --> 00:01:37,100
you can deny it,

54
00:01:37,101 --> 00:01:40,280
but then this happened and maybe they
denied and you can say why you can deny

55
00:01:40,281 --> 00:01:40,581
that.

56
00:01:40,581 --> 00:01:42,170
But then this happened.

57
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:44,753
Okay.

58
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:45,421
And you know,

59
00:01:45,421 --> 00:01:50,421
three times the charm and that's a time
when you should stand up for yourself

60
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,110
and say what you have to say.

61
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:52,830
Look,

62
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:56,310
you have to put yourself in a position
where you can say what you have to say.

63
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,750
You have to think it through,

64
00:01:57,751 --> 00:01:58,890
you have to have a plan.

65
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,760
And you can't just launch yourself off
the edge of a cliff and hope that God's

66
00:02:02,761 --> 00:02:04,260
going to catch you on the way down.

67
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:05,660
And I'm saying,

68
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:05,910
you know,

69
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:08,160
it's definitely the case that
if you have something to say,

70
00:02:08,161 --> 00:02:09,630
like if you're being oppressed at work,

71
00:02:09,631 --> 00:02:10,464
if you've got some,

72
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:11,550
you know,

73
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:13,290
horrible tyrant as a boss,

74
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:15,960
or maybe that's happening
to you in your marriage,

75
00:02:15,961 --> 00:02:17,370
or maybe you're the horrible tyrant,

76
00:02:17,371 --> 00:02:18,240
God only knows.

77
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:19,920
There's things that have to be said.

78
00:02:19,921 --> 00:02:21,840
But that doesn't mean you
can just blurt them out.

79
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:23,490
You have to have a plan.

80
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:25,290
You have to figure out
what you want to say.

81
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:28,350
You have to make it as minimally
troublesome as possible.

82
00:02:28,351 --> 00:02:31,440
You have to have the goal
that you want in mind,

83
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:33,930
and you have to have a
backup plan like this,

84
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:36,090
the sort of thing that
you're talking about.

85
00:02:36,091 --> 00:02:39,090
You know where you need to say
something that's like a little war.

86
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:41,880
You don't want to walk into
that unarmed and unprepared.

87
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:42,541
Now,

88
00:02:42,541 --> 00:02:43,830
that doesn't mean that you should,

89
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:48,690
that means that you should set up
your life so that you're firmly enough

90
00:02:48,691 --> 00:02:52,800
anchored in a variety of different ways
so that you can say what you need to say

91
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:55,710
without dying as a consequence.

92
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:56,400
So.
