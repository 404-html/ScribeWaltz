1
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:14,620
I think the women probably will man
up and then we've never forgiven,

2
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:19,900
which is part of the reason why

3
00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:22,503
it's Rondo

4
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:25,720
killed all those people.

5
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:27,303
It's because

6
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:31,390
he didn't like it.

7
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:32,293
No one even,

8
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:35,170
and his cell phone was
with something like,

9
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:40,890
I'm constantly in such a way that what
I've learned with rejection and then made

10
00:00:41,241 --> 00:00:41,951
it bigger.

11
00:00:41,951 --> 00:00:44,460
Your comprehension and murderers

12
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:49,640
and women are prone to reject him.

13
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:55,470
You have twice as many female ancestors
is male ancestors and evolutionary

14
00:00:55,471 --> 00:00:57,300
biology seems quite clear.

15
00:00:57,630 --> 00:01:02,250
The reason that we've diverged from a
common ancestor of chimpanzees and human

16
00:01:02,251 --> 00:01:07,251
beings is because chimpanzee females
are not sexually selective and human

17
00:01:07,591 --> 00:01:09,210
females are,

18
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:13,320
and that means that whatever
progress we've paid as a species,

19
00:01:13,321 --> 00:01:15,720
assuming what we paid
constitutes progress,

20
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:20,060
has been as a consequence of
women to proclivity to reject.

21
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:22,330
And you might think,

22
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:22,921
well,

23
00:01:22,921 --> 00:01:23,130
you know,

24
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:25,050
maybe that's a price worth paying,

25
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:27,400
but it's not necessarily a
price that you want to pay.

26
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:29,060
If you happen to be one of those bands,

27
00:01:29,061 --> 00:01:30,960
you were constantly be rejected.

28
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:33,810
Now perhaps to the right
attitude to that is,

29
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:34,231
well,

30
00:01:34,231 --> 00:01:38,400
you should figure out how to retool
yourself so that you're not being rejected

31
00:01:38,401 --> 00:01:40,830
by 50% of the population,

32
00:01:40,831 --> 00:01:44,530
which is fairly solid evidence that
there might be something about you that's

33
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:47,700
not exactly like straight and appropriate,

34
00:01:47,701 --> 00:01:48,534
let's say.

35
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:49,380
But you know,

36
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:50,390
that's a harsh test,

37
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:54,510
the harshest of all possible judgements
and it's very difficult thing for people

38
00:01:54,511 --> 00:01:57,160
to accept and no one did so,

39
00:01:57,190 --> 00:01:57,600
okay,

40
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,433
so anyways,

41
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:01,020
he thinks having self conscious and then,

42
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:01,831
then what happens?

43
00:02:01,831 --> 00:02:01,981
Well,

44
00:02:01,981 --> 00:02:06,720
the next part of the story is a black
quantity and so god goes for a walk to the

45
00:02:06,721 --> 00:02:09,620
guard and he's accustomed
to walking without them.

46
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:10,830
But that means to me,

47
00:02:10,831 --> 00:02:14,490
I think it's something like we weren't
conceptualized in this talk to some

48
00:02:14,491 --> 00:02:15,750
degree with God represents,

49
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:20,160
please can this part of the narrative
quick going represents that divine

50
00:02:20,161 --> 00:02:20,941
consciousness,

51
00:02:20,941 --> 00:02:25,941
let's say that you partake in that
confronts the potential of chaos.

52
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:31,160
Some transplants actually to walk with
that is to be guided by that principle.

53
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:32,731
You know,

54
00:02:32,731 --> 00:02:35,910
if you're on the street here on path
to where you should be in your life,

55
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:37,120
then natural you do it.

56
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,820
And maybe that requires courage.

57
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:40,800
It requires you to be forthright.

58
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:42,900
It requires you to look up into,

59
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:46,500
to try to make the world a better
place rather than a terrible place.

60
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:47,450
And so out,

61
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:51,220
these just the customer's doing have
him today after he's woken up and become

62
00:02:51,221 --> 00:02:52,054
self conscious,

63
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:54,340
he hides the,

64
00:02:54,341 --> 00:02:55,174
like the books.

65
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:59,130
And that's partly why it's
comical because you can't hide.

66
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:02,590
You can't hide from Bush

67
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:06,720
a Bush.

68
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:07,300
It's like,

69
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:10,060
and it doesn't reflect her
involve about to intelligence.

70
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:11,560
This is fraud.

71
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:15,820
And he's hiding behind a bush and
he comes up with three ladies.

72
00:03:15,821 --> 00:03:16,654
Excuse too.

73
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:18,200
So go ahead and calls officers,

74
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:19,363
what's up?

75
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:21,280
What are we supposed to go for a walk?

76
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,113
And then he says,

77
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:23,243
um,

78
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,280
I make an end to shade.

79
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,310
And God says,

80
00:03:27,311 --> 00:03:29,440
who told you that you were naked?

81
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:32,470
And this is the terrible
part of the story.

82
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:33,490
Um,

83
00:03:33,490 --> 00:03:33,671
you know,

84
00:03:33,671 --> 00:03:36,120
because eve is often
portrayed as the villain,

85
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:37,420
at least that's the theory,

86
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:38,290
right?

87
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:39,010
If you,

88
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:39,670
if you,

89
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:43,060
if you regard the biblical stories as
part of the patriarchal oppression,

90
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:48,480
centuries long patriarchal oppression
and eve is the bad person who's erupted.

91
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:49,210
Mankind.

92
00:03:49,210 --> 00:03:50,450
Madden has been severely,

93
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:54,490
it's complete rubbish because Adam shows
his true colors in the second part in

94
00:03:54,491 --> 00:03:59,491
the story because as soon as God calls
him who said that you were naked,

95
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:01,150
what does he mean?

96
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:03,550
He says he does two things.

97
00:04:03,551 --> 00:04:04,384
He says,

98
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:06,760
remember that the woman who made for me,

99
00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:08,410
it's her fault.

100
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:12,040
And so that's perfect day because it
doesn't take responsibility for his own

101
00:04:12,041 --> 00:04:14,440
action and Firstie Gladesville,

102
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:17,800
Wilbon and then Ian Lakes broad,

103
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:18,610
right?

104
00:04:18,610 --> 00:04:22,990
You might think that takes a fair bit
of goal and then that's exactly right.

105
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:24,610
And this is relevant.

106
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:30,180
It's relevant because that's exactly
what happened to this man in Toronto who

107
00:04:30,281 --> 00:04:31,270
killed all those people.

108
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:36,160
First thing he did because of his painful
self consciousness as plain white men.

109
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:40,780
And the second thing you did was
bleeding a lot and the third was take his

110
00:04:40,781 --> 00:04:41,614
revenge.

111
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:42,461
Okay,

112
00:04:42,461 --> 00:04:43,990
so that's the next story.

113
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:49,500
So God been very happy with this because
now the structure of Ba is permanently

114
00:04:51,581 --> 00:04:55,330
disrupted by the emergence of self
consciousness and their knowledge of death

115
00:04:55,331 --> 00:04:57,670
and the emergence of the
knowledge of good and evil.

116
00:04:57,671 --> 00:04:59,620
It's like so much for that paradise,

117
00:04:59,621 --> 00:05:00,160
right?

118
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:04,630
It's people have evolved
beyond their childhood.

119
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:09,570
Harriet's same thing happens to the
Buddha when he matures as fodder and links

120
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:10,960
in a walled city.

121
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:15,070
It's all where there's no agent has no
depth and there's no sickness and he

122
00:05:15,071 --> 00:05:16,810
grows up in there and
everything's perfect,

123
00:05:16,811 --> 00:05:20,740
but it gets curious and he goes outside
the walls of the city and the first

124
00:05:20,741 --> 00:05:22,720
thing he encounters is sickness.

125
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:26,520
And then he encounters old age and a
different voyage in any encounters.

126
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:31,590
And when he encounters get it never
goes back inside the walled city,

127
00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:32,580
his orders and eight,

128
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:34,540
four it's exactly the same idea.

129
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:36,010
So Alien,

130
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:38,110
race and God as long now to take shop,

131
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:38,590
you know,

132
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:39,520
you've really done it.

133
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:41,260
Here's what's going to happen.

134
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:46,960
You knew about the future and now you're
going to have to work because as soon

135
00:05:46,961 --> 00:05:48,100
as you know about the future,

136
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:49,600
then you have to work.

137
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:51,700
Because even if things are going well now,

138
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:55,060
that doesn't mean they're going to go
well in a monk and you better get ready

139
00:05:55,061 --> 00:05:55,894
for that.

140
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:59,320
You better get ready for the
then get ready for your old age,

141
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:02,960
then get ready for the fact that you
might get hill and so you're working on,

142
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:05,870
that's that human beings work.

143
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:07,740
We work because we're aware of the future.

144
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,850
He tells eve while you're in trouble too,

145
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:12,800
and I won't go into
this in too much detail,

146
00:06:12,801 --> 00:06:17,801
but part of each trouble is that she's
going to give birth to intelligence,

147
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:22,190
large skull and tiny dependent children,

148
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:26,060
and they're going to tear her apart and
shelter and she's going to have to be

149
00:06:26,061 --> 00:06:27,020
dependent on her husband.

150
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:32,590
And so those are the dual
curses of whatever we get
to wake up so well with the

151
00:06:32,691 --> 00:06:32,961
world.

152
00:06:32,961 --> 00:06:35,870
And that's what history starts as far
as the biblical stories are concerned.
