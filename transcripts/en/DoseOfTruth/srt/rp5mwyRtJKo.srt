1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,160
I don't know if you guys know about the,

2
00:00:02,161 --> 00:00:02,994
uh,

3
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:06,780
the daycare scandals that,

4
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:07,621
that were very,

5
00:00:07,621 --> 00:00:12,090
very common in the 1980s
so horribly common,

6
00:00:12,091 --> 00:00:13,710
actually this infested many towns.

7
00:00:13,711 --> 00:00:17,550
And usually what would happen is somebody
who is a little on the paranoid side

8
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:21,600
or maybe a lot of on the paranoid side
would send their children off to daycare.

9
00:00:21,601 --> 00:00:23,130
And that was a whole new thing in the 80s,

10
00:00:23,131 --> 00:00:23,341
right?

11
00:00:23,341 --> 00:00:24,174
Because women were,

12
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:24,571
you know,

13
00:00:24,571 --> 00:00:28,050
moving into the workforce like mad and
so they were handing over there often

14
00:00:28,051 --> 00:00:31,410
their infants kids below
three say two total strangers.

15
00:00:31,411 --> 00:00:32,070
And you know,

16
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:34,320
for some of them that set
up a fair bit of worry.

17
00:00:34,321 --> 00:00:35,250
Like it still does.

18
00:00:35,251 --> 00:00:37,080
And sometimes that word got out of hand,

19
00:00:37,081 --> 00:00:40,290
especially among the people who are
a little on the little predisposed to

20
00:00:40,291 --> 00:00:41,490
paranoid schizophrenia.

21
00:00:41,491 --> 00:00:44,430
And maybe even had had
some previous episodes.

22
00:00:44,431 --> 00:00:45,090
And so,

23
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:45,421
you know,

24
00:00:45,421 --> 00:00:49,740
the kid would come home and the mother
would observe or not something kind of

25
00:00:49,741 --> 00:00:51,300
peculiar about their behavior.

26
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:53,790
And then she'd fantasize
about maybe what that was.

27
00:00:53,791 --> 00:00:54,460
And then,

28
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:54,740
you know,

29
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:58,440
she started asking the child if the child
had been touched in any particular way

30
00:00:58,441 --> 00:00:59,370
and you know,

31
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:01,800
and she keep this up for
a good length of time.

32
00:01:01,801 --> 00:01:05,550
And then the child would start to have
nightmares and then the child would tell

33
00:01:05,551 --> 00:01:08,760
the mother about what the nightmares
were and then that would freak her out.

34
00:01:08,761 --> 00:01:11,040
And so she'd ask even
deeper questions and soon,

35
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:11,610
you know,

36
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:14,970
her children were telling her that
horrible things were happening to them at

37
00:01:14,971 --> 00:01:15,780
daycare.

38
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:18,930
And so then she'd go to the police and
they wouldn't look into recycling Patrick

39
00:01:18,931 --> 00:01:19,764
background.

40
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:22,980
And then the police would go out and
they'd start to interview other children.

41
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:25,020
And if they interviewed them properly,

42
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:28,860
then the other children would start to
produce all these stories as well because

43
00:01:28,861 --> 00:01:30,570
the now how did that happen?

44
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:31,350
Well,

45
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:32,160
a bunch of ways.

46
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:32,993
The first is

47
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:39,240
the police would ask
leading questions like,

48
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:41,010
did anyone touch you?

49
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:41,933
Well,

50
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:43,620
of course I'm going to touch the cans.

51
00:01:43,621 --> 00:01:43,921
I mean,

52
00:01:43,921 --> 00:01:44,880
people touch kids.

53
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:46,980
Did anybody touch you there?

54
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:47,940
Well,

55
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:49,110
that's not a question.

56
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:51,300
That's a piece of information.

57
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:56,570
The piece of information is if someone
touched me there and adult would be very

58
00:01:57,091 --> 00:01:58,440
interested in that,

59
00:01:58,740 --> 00:01:59,550
right?

60
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:00,150
So what now,

61
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:02,820
what's a child doing when he's
answering and adults questions?

62
00:02:02,821 --> 00:02:05,370
Wealth child doesn't bloody well
know what the hell do they know?

63
00:02:05,371 --> 00:02:06,360
They're like three.

64
00:02:06,361 --> 00:02:07,050
You know,

65
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:09,270
they can't hardly organize their story.

66
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:09,841
You know,

67
00:02:09,841 --> 00:02:11,760
if you're talking to a
kid and you want to give,

68
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:14,160
get them to give you an
account of their day,

69
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:18,570
you have to really guide them through
the Organization of their memory.

70
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:21,750
And partly what they're doing when you're
doing that is they're looking at you

71
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:25,500
trying to figure out if they're
telling you the right things,

72
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:26,880
which is what they should be doing.

73
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:30,630
Because what they're trying to learn
to do is to tell people things in a way

74
00:02:30,631 --> 00:02:31,710
that they'll understand them.

75
00:02:31,711 --> 00:02:33,030
But that makes the child very,

76
00:02:33,031 --> 00:02:37,650
very responsive to the nonverbal
and verbal cues of the adult.

77
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:41,010
You think about how fast those little
rats learn how to pick up language.

78
00:02:41,011 --> 00:02:41,490
You know,

79
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:44,130
it's really very fast and
no one really teaches them.

80
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:46,080
They're just paying attention like mad.

81
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:50,610
So you get a bunch of cops who were on
how like a half cocked adventure and they

82
00:02:50,611 --> 00:02:54,750
think there's some serial sexual pervert
in their midst and they go interview,

83
00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:55,470
you know,

84
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:57,650
1520 kids and they do do,

85
00:02:57,670 --> 00:02:58,140
do it,

86
00:02:58,140 --> 00:02:58,910
do it a lot.

87
00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:02,230
They use the little dolls and they do it
a lot and they do it a lot and they do

88
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:06,970
a lot and sooner or later all the kids
start having nightmares and then they

89
00:03:06,971 --> 00:03:07,960
start telling the carbs.

90
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,910
There's all these terrible things happen,

91
00:03:09,911 --> 00:03:13,090
like they're taking into underground
caverns and they're stripped naked and

92
00:03:13,091 --> 00:03:17,650
they're forced to like leap frog over
each other and like you just can't believe

93
00:03:17,651 --> 00:03:17,771
it.

94
00:03:17,771 --> 00:03:18,341
What happened?

95
00:03:18,341 --> 00:03:19,190
You can't believe it.

96
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:22,000
It's all documented in a
book called Satan's silence,

97
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:24,280
which was written by a
social worker and a lawyer.

98
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:25,810
It's mind boggling.

99
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:31,170
The longest prison sentence is in American
history were handed out to it to a

100
00:03:31,241 --> 00:03:36,241
series of middle aged women who are taking
care of little kids and the FBI even

101
00:03:36,281 --> 00:03:38,290
came up with a whole
new criminal category,

102
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:39,970
late onset,

103
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,890
female sexual offender.

104
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:42,401
Well,

105
00:03:42,401 --> 00:03:44,500
why didn't that category exist before?

106
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:45,730
It's simple.

107
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:47,740
There are no late onset,

108
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:50,110
middle aged female sexual offenders.

109
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:52,150
That's why we didn't need the category.

110
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:54,400
But once all these accusations came up,

111
00:03:54,401 --> 00:03:55,061
well poof,

112
00:03:55,061 --> 00:03:55,301
you know,

113
00:03:55,301 --> 00:03:57,610
you had to have some damn
category for these poor women.

114
00:03:57,610 --> 00:04:01,000
Some of them were put
in jail for 350 years,

115
00:04:01,001 --> 00:04:04,780
which seems a bit excessive given that
they're only going to last about 40,

116
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:05,231
you know,

117
00:04:05,231 --> 00:04:08,080
they get 12 consecutive life sentences.

118
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:08,800
So it,

119
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:09,341
and you know,

120
00:04:09,341 --> 00:04:14,341
there was actually a situation where
one town went so far as to start digging

121
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:18,370
underneath the town to
find these underground,

122
00:04:18,371 --> 00:04:22,090
say tannic layers where all these
weird ritual things were going on,

123
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:22,751
you know,

124
00:04:22,751 --> 00:04:27,751
and along with this was not one
shred of Collab of concrete evidence,

125
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:28,421
you know,

126
00:04:28,421 --> 00:04:32,710
on the eventual conclusions and
disaffected thousands of people.

127
00:04:32,711 --> 00:04:34,240
The eventual conclusions was,

128
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:34,991
well,

129
00:04:34,991 --> 00:04:35,270
they're,

130
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:37,030
there actually isn't anybody who's,

131
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:37,810
you know,

132
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:39,010
saint technically,

133
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:39,820
uh,

134
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:42,010
torturing children in daycare centers.
