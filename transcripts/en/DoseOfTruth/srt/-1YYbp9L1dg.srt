1
00:00:07,130 --> 00:00:10,480
To tap into the dopaminergic system,
you said you needed to value goal.

2
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:12,660
Is there any way to tap into the opioid
system?

3
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:16,800
I want to be more connected to people,
but part of me can't get myself to care.

4
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:18,151
Okay.
Well,

5
00:00:18,151 --> 00:00:21,000
one of the things that,
so maybe you're a little bit on the

6
00:00:21,001 --> 00:00:22,980
disagreeable side,
that's a possibility.

7
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:27,540
There's some interesting clinical
evidence that suggests that one of the

8
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:31,800
things that disagreeable people can do
in order to facilitate their

9
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:34,890
interactions with other people is to do
people favors.

10
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:40,220
And so what you might say is that you
could start by acting like you care and

11
00:00:40,321 --> 00:00:43,440
then maybe you could learn how to care
through doing that.

12
00:00:43,441 --> 00:00:44,730
So maybe you could say,
well,

13
00:00:44,731 --> 00:00:48,660
I'm going to do something nice for
someone once every two days for a month

14
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:51,660
and,
and think about it a little bit and see

15
00:00:51,661 --> 00:00:53,130
what,
see if that changes you.

16
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:57,000
Because you know,
sometimes you think yourself into change

17
00:00:57,001 --> 00:01:00,210
and sometimes you act yourself into
changing your thoughts.

18
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:03,510
And so that's what I would start by
doing.

19
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:05,220
Um,
and you know,

20
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:11,060
you could also be more connected to
people regardless of whether you care,

21
00:01:11,161 --> 00:01:13,110
you know,
let's say that it would take you six

22
00:01:13,111 --> 00:01:17,190
months of practice or even a year of
practice before you care.

23
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:20,070
But that's not so long,
especially if you're young.

24
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:24,570
So
that's what I say about that.
