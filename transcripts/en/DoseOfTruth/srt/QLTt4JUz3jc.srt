1
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:07,900
Paul maloney asks you,

2
00:00:07,901 --> 00:00:10,780
edited out a disagreement
with Camille Paglia,

3
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:11,560
what was it?

4
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:12,393
No,

5
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:12,790
no,

6
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:13,810
that's not the case.

7
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:15,220
There was a piece edited out,

8
00:00:15,221 --> 00:00:17,170
but it wasn't because
there was a disagreement,

9
00:00:17,171 --> 00:00:20,260
it was because there was some glitch
in the video or something like that.

10
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:22,180
Generally speaking,

11
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:22,961
and you know,

12
00:00:22,961 --> 00:00:24,820
I can't say this with absolute certainty,

13
00:00:24,821 --> 00:00:29,821
but I do and so does my crew do everything
we possibly can to leave the videos

14
00:00:30,131 --> 00:00:34,540
alone except for getting rid of things
that would be of no interest to anyone

15
00:00:34,541 --> 00:00:35,440
that are mistakes.

16
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:37,900
So there was no disagreement.

17
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:40,480
Are you interested in coming to Australia?

18
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:41,081
Yes,

19
00:00:41,081 --> 00:00:43,900
I've been invited a couple of
times but it hasn't worked out yet.

20
00:00:43,901 --> 00:00:44,231
But,

21
00:00:44,231 --> 00:00:45,064
um,

22
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:50,070
my book will be published in Australia
I think sometime in January as well.

23
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:51,430
And uh,

24
00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:56,430
I imagined that all becoming there at
some point in order to talk about my book

25
00:00:57,521 --> 00:00:58,354
and so on.

26
00:00:58,580 --> 00:00:59,413
Um,

27
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:01,320
okay.

28
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:01,971
Trace is,

29
00:01:01,971 --> 00:01:05,510
how can a person go through the future
authoring process of imagining a future

30
00:01:05,511 --> 00:01:08,690
for yourself as though you or someone
you care about when you barely don't care

31
00:01:08,691 --> 00:01:10,520
about yourself or even hate yourself?

32
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:11,900
Yeah.

33
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:12,590
Well,

34
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:14,750
I would say that.

35
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:16,430
Okay,

36
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:21,430
go through the exercise anyways and act
as like try to extend to yourself some

37
00:01:22,281 --> 00:01:23,114
courtesy.

38
00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:23,601
You know,

39
00:01:23,601 --> 00:01:27,590
sometimes you have to act something
out before you can start to believe it.

40
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:30,290
And so I would say sit down and

41
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:34,380
pretend that you're your friend,

42
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:35,131
you know,

43
00:01:35,131 --> 00:01:40,020
trade the probability that there's
something so wrong with you that you don't

44
00:01:40,021 --> 00:01:43,320
deserve any regard whatsoever is zero,

45
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:44,183
you know?

46
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:47,010
So and I would say if,

47
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,230
if you just can't get it together,

48
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:49,950
you know,

49
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:54,060
maybe you are depressed and maybe you
need to go talk to someone because you

50
00:01:54,061 --> 00:01:55,200
don't have to be depressed.

51
00:01:55,201 --> 00:01:56,340
You'd talk to a physician,

52
00:01:56,341 --> 00:01:58,440
you know there are
treatments for depression.

53
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:01,980
If you happen to be depressed and
if you actually hate yourself,

54
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:04,710
then it's a possibility
that that's what's going on.

55
00:02:04,711 --> 00:02:05,970
I don't know how old you are,

56
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:09,570
but you know there are effective
treatments for that sort of thing.

57
00:02:09,571 --> 00:02:12,750
You might want to find out if there's
actually something wrong physically or,

58
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:14,520
or psychophysiologic Lee,

59
00:02:14,521 --> 00:02:14,821
you know,

60
00:02:14,821 --> 00:02:19,821
because you don't have to trudge
through life absolutely miserable there.

61
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,320
Antidepressants for example,

62
00:02:22,321 --> 00:02:23,820
work really well for some people.

63
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:24,720
Not for everyone,

64
00:02:24,721 --> 00:02:25,920
but for some people.
