1
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:08,700
I'm really curious about your views about,

2
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:09,900
well,

3
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:10,291
well,

4
00:00:10,291 --> 00:00:10,950
what,

5
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:12,660
what postmodernism is.

6
00:00:12,661 --> 00:00:13,500
First of all,

7
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:14,490
I know you've,

8
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:15,870
you've identified it with the,

9
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:17,340
with the general tricksters,

10
00:00:17,341 --> 00:00:21,330
Derrida and Lakota and Sukkot and from
coal in particular you've talked about,

11
00:00:21,331 --> 00:00:25,740
but I'd like to know what you think about
postmodernism and also why you think

12
00:00:25,741 --> 00:00:27,570
it's been so attractive to people.

13
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:28,540
Well,

14
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:33,540
my explanation is that
there is no authentic 1960s
point of view in any of the

15
00:00:35,531 --> 00:00:36,580
elite universities.

16
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:36,810
Okay.

17
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:37,750
But rather,

18
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:43,330
the most liberated minds of my generation
were 1960 did not go onto graduate

19
00:00:43,421 --> 00:00:43,871
school.

20
00:00:43,871 --> 00:00:45,190
I witnessed this with my own eyes.

21
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:47,220
I saw genuine Marxist.

22
00:00:47,230 --> 00:00:47,411
Okay.

23
00:00:47,411 --> 00:00:48,191
At my college,

24
00:00:48,191 --> 00:00:51,130
which was the State University
of New York at Binghamton,

25
00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:53,290
upstate New York Harbor College,

26
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:58,440
which had a huge cohort of very
radical downstate New York Jews.

27
00:00:59,440 --> 00:00:59,711
Okay.

28
00:00:59,711 --> 00:01:01,150
Who in fact the Harper would,

29
00:01:01,151 --> 00:01:02,710
we used to be called Berkeley East.

30
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:04,750
So I saw genuine,

31
00:01:04,751 --> 00:01:06,820
passionate marks this with my own eyes.

32
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:12,240
They were not word choppers and they
were not snide postmodernists right.

33
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:15,400
They were in your face aggressive.

34
00:01:15,730 --> 00:01:17,800
They use the language of the people.

35
00:01:17,801 --> 00:01:19,810
They had a populist and energy.

36
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:20,320
Okay.

37
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:21,610
They dressed working class.

38
00:01:21,611 --> 00:01:23,170
They were non materialistic.

39
00:01:23,171 --> 00:01:23,261
Hey,

40
00:01:23,261 --> 00:01:25,810
these are people who lived
by their own convictions.

41
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:28,570
They were against the graduate school.

42
00:01:28,571 --> 00:01:29,290
So when I,

43
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:30,123
when I,

44
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:31,103
uh,

45
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:34,870
went on to graduate school and it became
known that I was going to go to Yale,

46
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:38,460
I was confronted by a leader
of the radicals on campus.

47
00:01:38,650 --> 00:01:43,650
I'm in broad daylight in front of everyone
who denounced me for is the new Grad

48
00:01:43,931 --> 00:01:45,160
school is not where it's happening.

49
00:01:45,161 --> 00:01:45,491
You don't,

50
00:01:45,491 --> 00:01:46,360
you don't do that.

51
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:48,160
If you have to go to graduate school,

52
00:01:48,161 --> 00:01:49,120
you should go to buffalo.

53
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:49,540
Now,

54
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:53,470
I had applied to these students as
SUNY buffalo because the great leftest

55
00:01:53,471 --> 00:01:54,010
critic,

56
00:01:54,010 --> 00:01:56,680
Leslie Fiedler was there
who had a huge impact on me.

57
00:01:56,681 --> 00:01:57,041
He's part,

58
00:01:57,041 --> 00:01:57,420
he created,

59
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:58,780
created identity politics,

60
00:01:58,781 --> 00:02:01,180
but without it's present distortions,

61
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:01,910
right.

62
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:02,170
Uh,

63
00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:03,020
and Norman Holland,

64
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:04,450
the psychoanalytic critic was there.

65
00:02:04,451 --> 00:02:06,130
I would have a very happy
to have gone on to Buffalo,

66
00:02:06,131 --> 00:02:07,710
but I needed the library Yale.

67
00:02:07,711 --> 00:02:08,501
So I continued on to,

68
00:02:08,501 --> 00:02:09,160
yeah,

69
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:09,641
the word,

70
00:02:09,641 --> 00:02:11,050
no radicals in the,

71
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,420
in the graduate schools,

72
00:02:13,421 --> 00:02:13,900
right.

73
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:16,420
From 1968 to 72 when I was there.

74
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:19,050
Only one radical Todd Gitlin.

75
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:19,240
Okay.

76
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:21,040
Went on to have a career success.

77
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:21,460
Okay.

78
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:21,720
The,

79
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:26,720
the actual radicals in the 1960s either
when off dropped out of college and went

80
00:02:27,161 --> 00:02:31,930
off to create communes or they were
taking acid and destroyed their brains.

81
00:02:31,931 --> 00:02:35,470
Now I have also written about
that the destruction of the,

82
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:36,400
of the mines.

83
00:02:36,401 --> 00:02:36,680
Okay.

84
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:36,950
Alpha,

85
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:40,390
the most talented members of
my generation through Lsd,

86
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:42,190
it was going on all around me,

87
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:46,600
right towards what's happened is the
actual legacy of the 60s got truncated.

88
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:51,750
The idea that these poststructuralism
postmodernists are heirs of the 1960

89
00:02:51,901 --> 00:02:54,820
[inaudible] revolution
is an absolute crock.

90
00:02:54,850 --> 00:02:55,300
Okay.

91
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:57,400
What they represent as Fuko shows,

92
00:02:57,490 --> 00:02:58,870
shows Foucault said,

93
00:02:58,871 --> 00:02:59,290
okay.

94
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:04,290
The biggest influence on his thinking
was Samuel Beckett's waiting for Godot.

95
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:04,661
Okay.

96
00:03:04,661 --> 00:03:09,370
Which wasn't post World War
Two play written in Paris.

97
00:03:09,371 --> 00:03:12,760
That was about the disillusionment
and nihilism experienced.

98
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:17,320
After Hitler went through occupied
France and all of Europe was in ruins.

99
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,010
It had nothing to do.

100
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:23,380
What's in when you were going to go has
nothing to do with the authentic legacy

101
00:03:23,381 --> 00:03:26,890
of the 1960s which was about
genuine multiculturalism,

102
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,540
a movement toward India,

103
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,780
toward Hinduism.

104
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:32,860
I a transformation of
consciousness through psychedelics,

105
00:03:32,861 --> 00:03:34,210
which I did not take,

106
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:36,670
but which identify with
totally through the music,

107
00:03:36,671 --> 00:03:37,170
et cetera.

108
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:37,690
All right?

109
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:39,580
It was a turn toward the body.

110
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:42,260
It was a turn toward sensory experience.

111
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:42,460
Okay.

112
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:43,240
I'm not this,

113
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:47,920
this word shopping thing and it's like
cynical removal from actual experience.

114
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:48,340
Right.

115
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:49,720
That French import.

116
00:03:49,721 --> 00:03:49,961
Okay.

117
00:03:49,961 --> 00:03:50,740
Came in.

118
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:50,921
Okay.

119
00:03:50,921 --> 00:03:51,121
It should,

120
00:03:51,121 --> 00:03:52,070
the graduate schools,

121
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:55,330
it did not affect any
genuine 1960s person,

122
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:56,700
the real 19 six,

123
00:03:56,701 --> 00:03:58,750
his revolution was about young.

124
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:03,460
It was about a way of seeing the
cosmos in mythological terms.

125
00:04:03,461 --> 00:04:03,790
Right.

126
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:08,790
And the union contribution went on
into the new age movement of the 1970s.

127
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:11,170
Aside from the universities.

128
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:16,590
So who took over the universities were
these careerists I saw them with my own

129
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:17,561
eyes.

130
00:04:17,561 --> 00:04:18,610
I saw what happened.

131
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:22,780
I saw I was at Yale when dairy
dye was being shipped over and to,

132
00:04:22,781 --> 00:04:23,021
to,

133
00:04:23,021 --> 00:04:24,310
to address the,

134
00:04:24,311 --> 00:04:24,431
uh,

135
00:04:24,431 --> 00:04:24,710
you know,

136
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:24,891
the,

137
00:04:24,891 --> 00:04:27,660
the students or Grad students
and the faculty and I,

138
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:31,210
and I said to a fellow student after
hearing one of these guys speak,

139
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:32,750
it wasn't dairy died,

140
00:04:32,751 --> 00:04:33,401
it was a,

141
00:04:33,401 --> 00:04:35,470
it wasn't another one of the theorists.

142
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:36,190
I said,

143
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:39,880
they are like high priests
murmuring to each other.

144
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:40,450
Uh,

145
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:40,691
this,

146
00:04:40,691 --> 00:04:43,720
this was an elitist form from the start.

147
00:04:43,721 --> 00:04:44,230
Okay.

148
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:46,120
It was not progressive.

149
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:47,680
It was knocked revolutionary.

150
00:04:47,681 --> 00:04:49,120
It was reactionary.

151
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:54,160
It was a desperate attempt to hold on
to what had happened before the 1960s

152
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:55,270
sensory revolution.

153
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:55,910
Nope.

154
00:04:55,910 --> 00:04:56,070
Well,

155
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:57,310
this postmodernist thing.

156
00:04:57,311 --> 00:04:57,730
Okay.

157
00:04:57,730 --> 00:04:58,960
This trashing,

158
00:04:58,980 --> 00:04:59,300
okay.

159
00:04:59,300 --> 00:04:59,680
Of,

160
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,700
of the text.

161
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:03,610
This is this encouragement.

162
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:03,940
Okay.

163
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:08,140
Have I superior and destructive attitude
toward the work of art we're going

164
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:08,381
through.

165
00:05:08,381 --> 00:05:09,010
It's okay.

166
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:10,990
Primly with red pen in hand.

167
00:05:10,991 --> 00:05:13,180
Finding all the evidence of sexism.

168
00:05:13,181 --> 00:05:14,340
Check racism,

169
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:15,400
check homophobia.

170
00:05:15,401 --> 00:05:15,790
Check.

171
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:17,870
That is not the impact.

172
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,480
Thick emotional.

173
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:19,840
Okay.

174
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,280
Sensory based.

175
00:05:21,281 --> 00:05:21,760
Okay.

176
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:23,440
A revolution of the 1960s.

177
00:05:23,441 --> 00:05:23,770
I,

178
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:27,970
I am sick and tired of these people
claiming any kind of mantle from the 1960s

179
00:05:27,971 --> 00:05:28,870
they're frauds.

180
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:29,890
These people are,

181
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:34,950
what happened in the 1970s was a
collapse of the job market in academe.

182
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:35,690
Right?

183
00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:39,220
All of a sudden jobs were
scarce and this thing was there.

184
00:05:39,221 --> 00:05:41,740
The new and improved and shiny thing.

185
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:42,130
Okay.

186
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:43,150
To be a theorist,

187
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:44,440
people seized on it.

188
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:44,830
Okay.

189
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:46,270
It was institutionalized.

190
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:46,630
Right.

191
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:46,991
And I,

192
00:05:46,991 --> 00:05:49,480
it's an enormous betrayal
of the 1960 [inaudible].
