1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:05,270
As I've mentioned to you before,
each of the three aspects of experience,

2
00:00:06,031 --> 00:00:11,031
so the things you know,
the things you don't know and the fact

3
00:00:11,761 --> 00:00:15,090
of yourself have a very ambivalent
underlying structure,

4
00:00:15,091 --> 00:00:19,440
both positive and negative so that the
things you don't know are interesting

5
00:00:19,441 --> 00:00:21,600
and compelling and the sources of new
information,

6
00:00:21,601 --> 00:00:26,310
but also the source of the things that
undermine you both physically and

7
00:00:26,311 --> 00:00:31,260
mentally and the things you know.
Of course your culture disciplines you

8
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:37,490
and shapes you into a full person,
but also at exactly the same time molds.

9
00:00:40,161 --> 00:00:44,490
Zealand crushes you in a particular
direction rather than any of the other

10
00:00:44,491 --> 00:00:48,180
directions you might have gone in.
And then finally with regards to the

11
00:00:48,181 --> 00:00:51,810
individual,
we spent a substantial amount of time

12
00:00:51,811 --> 00:00:56,811
discussing the individual's capability
capacity to make order out of chaos and

13
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:03,430
sometimes to make chaos out of order in
the service of a higher order and that's

14
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:06,630
all to the good,
but just like culture and nature have

15
00:01:06,631 --> 00:01:10,290
there negative aspects.
So do the individual and I think

16
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:14,580
personally this is where Christian
mythology in particular comes into its

17
00:01:14,581 --> 00:01:15,414
own.

18
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:22,370
I think of all the major religions,
Christianity has the most thoroughly

19
00:01:22,921 --> 00:01:27,630
developed what you might describe as
formal model of evil,

20
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:32,190
and that model isn't part of the
canonical writings of Christianity,

21
00:01:32,191 --> 00:01:36,340
say encapsulated in the Bible,
but part of the cloud of sort of

22
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:40,170
unnatural mythology and storytelling
that surrounds the canonical writings,

23
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:45,500
so you could say that although
Christianity and Buddhism has spent a

24
00:01:45,571 --> 00:01:50,190
substantial amount of time developing up
a representation of the hero,

25
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:55,980
Christianity in particular has also
spent a substantial amount of time

26
00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:00,780
developing a formal portrait of the
figure that stands in opposition to the

27
00:02:00,781 --> 00:02:05,781
hero and I think the most appropriate
term for that figure who takes multiple

28
00:02:05,791 --> 00:02:08,520
forms in mythology is the adversary
because

29
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:15,080
the adversarial spirit is a spirit that
stands in opposition to to everything

30
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,820
stands in opposition to nature,
stands in opposition to culture,

31
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:25,140
and most specifically stands in
opposition to that aspect of the human

32
00:02:25,141 --> 00:02:25,440
being.

33
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:29,340
That's both exploratory and creative.
Now,

34
00:02:29,341 --> 00:02:34,341
the last time we talked,
I had a chance to describe to you how

35
00:02:35,011 --> 00:02:40,011
the figures of the adversarial brothers
emerged naturally at the end of genesis

36
00:02:40,561 --> 00:02:42,270
as a,
as a Coda to the story,

37
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:44,160
right?
Adam and eve developed self

38
00:02:44,161 --> 00:02:46,170
consciousness.
They develop knowledge of their own

39
00:02:46,171 --> 00:02:51,171
mortality and death and as the
primordial parents of humanity,

40
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:55,350
their first children take the form of
the hostile brothers,

41
00:02:55,351 --> 00:02:59,010
which is to say that if you're the child
of nature and the child of culture,

42
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:04,020
the sort of ultimate parents,
then as an individual,

43
00:03:04,091 --> 00:03:07,000
you take two forms,
a positive form in a negative form,

44
00:03:07,001 --> 00:03:11,590
and the negative form is characterized
in many ways by a kind of absolute

45
00:03:11,591 --> 00:03:14,920
hatred of the good hatred of the
positive form.

46
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:20,400
And I think that you can't understand
the full human propensity for evil

47
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:26,200
without considering more than the
territory,

48
00:03:26,201 --> 00:03:29,390
lot more than the innate territoriality
of human beings.

49
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:30,610
So if you look at animals,
well,

50
00:03:30,611 --> 00:03:35,611
animals are territorial and they fight
to preserve their territory and it's

51
00:03:35,621 --> 00:03:38,650
irrational struggle.
They're fighting for resources and for a

52
00:03:38,651 --> 00:03:43,160
place that they can that they can
operate and live in and reproduce in

53
00:03:43,161 --> 00:03:46,240
efficiently.
But human beings are substantively

54
00:03:46,241 --> 00:03:50,080
different from that,
in that there are agonistic conflict.

55
00:03:50,081 --> 00:03:54,700
Their aggression often seems to be
motivated by something more akin to the

56
00:03:54,701 --> 00:03:57,960
pure desire for destruction rather than
for any rational landlord.

57
00:03:57,961 --> 00:04:01,420
So ever.
And so from that perspective,

58
00:04:01,421 --> 00:04:06,421
I would say as an example,
the fact that Hitler ended up committing

59
00:04:07,691 --> 00:04:12,190
suicide in a bunker beneath Germany's
capital at the end of the Second World

60
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:15,310
War when Berlin was in flames when all
of Germany was in flames and when his

61
00:04:15,311 --> 00:04:18,370
country was completely defeated,
after tens of millions of people had

62
00:04:18,371 --> 00:04:22,150
died in the conflict,
including of course the 7 million or so

63
00:04:22,151 --> 00:04:23,890
people that were killed in the
Holocaust.

64
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,350
The normal mode of interpretation of
that would be what a terrible defeat for

65
00:04:29,351 --> 00:04:31,390
Hitler.
But an equally valid.

66
00:04:31,391 --> 00:04:35,260
And I think an equally valid prima facie
argument.

67
00:04:35,261 --> 00:04:38,500
And one I think that's actually more
valid is that it wasn't a defeat for

68
00:04:38,501 --> 00:04:41,680
Hitler at all.
It was precisely what he was aiming at

69
00:04:41,681 --> 00:04:46,681
right from the beginning because his
mode of being was intensely adversarial.

70
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:51,340
And I would also say that it's certainly
possible that the full nature of his

71
00:04:51,341 --> 00:04:56,341
motivations weren't even necessarily
clear to him as they unfolded across

72
00:04:57,011 --> 00:05:00,400
time during the Second World War.
No more than the full motivations of any

73
00:05:00,401 --> 00:05:04,120
human being are necessarily accessible
to them as they act out,

74
00:05:04,121 --> 00:05:06,550
whatever it is that they act out.
So Carl Jung says,

75
00:05:06,551 --> 00:05:09,790
for example,
that we act out great mythological

76
00:05:09,791 --> 00:05:12,850
stories.
That doesn't necessarily mean you know

77
00:05:12,851 --> 00:05:14,680
the story,
it just means he act it out.

78
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:17,500
So for example,
you see people whose lives are

79
00:05:17,501 --> 00:05:22,501
repetitive bouts of tragedy and what
they're acting out is a tragic story and

80
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:25,810
they know it in so far as they're
actually acting it out,

81
00:05:25,811 --> 00:05:30,010
but they don't necessarily have an
explicit model of the relationship

82
00:05:30,011 --> 00:05:33,010
between their patterns of behavior and
the constantly tragic outcomes they

83
00:05:33,011 --> 00:05:33,844
produce.

84
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:35,890
Well,
that doesn't even necessarily mean that

85
00:05:35,891 --> 00:05:39,520
what they're doing isn't voluntary
because things can be voluntary even if

86
00:05:39,521 --> 00:05:44,470
you don't understand them fully.
There's an aspect to the human psyche

87
00:05:44,471 --> 00:05:46,570
that's a nest of vipers,
so to speak,

88
00:05:46,571 --> 00:05:49,870
because you can't necessarily trust what
you see.

89
00:05:49,871 --> 00:05:52,180
And that means not only when you're
looking at someone else say,

90
00:05:52,181 --> 00:05:53,530
but even when you're looking in the
mirror,

91
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,980
you can't be sure that what you say
you're doing is exactly what you're.

92
00:05:57,950 --> 00:06:00,860
Your motivations aren't transparent and
they may not even be clear.

93
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:10,920
So I suppose the idea that lurks behind
this formalization is that freedom of

94
00:06:11,081 --> 00:06:16,081
choice is such a good that one of its
subsidiary necessities,

95
00:06:16,721 --> 00:06:21,460
which is that there has to be a polar
distinction between good and evil is

96
00:06:21,461 --> 00:06:24,100
worth having.
Freedom is so important that it

97
00:06:24,101 --> 00:06:26,590
justifies the distinction between good
and evil.

98
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:30,190
And I think that art,
I think that's a reasonable way to

99
00:06:30,191 --> 00:06:31,024
presume

100
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:37,620
it's reasonable to presume that that's
the manner in which experience is

101
00:06:37,621 --> 00:06:40,390
actually structured and there's complex
reasons for that.

102
00:06:40,391 --> 00:06:44,140
One would be that under the most optimal
circumstances,

103
00:06:44,141 --> 00:06:47,470
which is something we'll talk about as
this proceeds to a close,

104
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:50,260
that means in a sense you can have your
cake and eat it too,

105
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:55,030
which means the potential existence of
good and evil allows for freedom of

106
00:06:55,031 --> 00:06:57,820
choice.
And then if the choice is always towards

107
00:06:57,821 --> 00:07:00,580
the good,
then you have the benefits of freedom.

108
00:07:00,581 --> 00:07:04,210
Of choice plus the benefits of the good,
the only price you have to pay is the

109
00:07:04,211 --> 00:07:07,570
constant possibility of evil.
It's very much like the structure of

110
00:07:07,571 --> 00:07:12,280
Christianity,
so you have the highest God whose whose

111
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:16,390
highest son is Christ,
but you have the figure of Satan lurking

112
00:07:16,391 --> 00:07:19,600
in the background who's also got a
filial relationship with the highest

113
00:07:19,601 --> 00:07:22,240
God.
It makes for a confusing kind of

114
00:07:22,241 --> 00:07:24,850
theology because in many situations,
of course,

115
00:07:24,851 --> 00:07:28,900
Christ is identified specifically with
God the father,

116
00:07:28,930 --> 00:07:31,390
but Satan always lurks in the background
and his.

117
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:36,220
His existential status is indeterminant
because since God is everything,

118
00:07:36,221 --> 00:07:39,490
then it's very difficult to make the
case that the evil spirit isn't a

119
00:07:39,491 --> 00:07:42,640
derivative of God.
It's not easy thing to get straightened

120
00:07:42,641 --> 00:07:46,420
out rationally,
and I think Milton in paradise lost as a

121
00:07:46,421 --> 00:07:49,930
very good attempt,
makes a very good attempt to explain

122
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:52,930
exactly what this might mean,
how there could be an overarching

123
00:07:52,931 --> 00:07:57,190
transcendent power and there could be
two subordinate elements to that one

124
00:07:57,191 --> 00:08:02,191
evil in one good without destroying the
idea that God as such as good and with

125
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:06,610
out eradicating the reality of evil.
Very,

126
00:08:06,611 --> 00:08:11,611
very complex argument to make.
Now the notion of evil is also very,

127
00:08:11,981 --> 00:08:15,220
very complex idea,
so if you look at our arguments that

128
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:18,440
support atheism,
and I've mentioned some of these like

129
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:21,220
Ivan's argument in the brothers
Karamazov where Ivan says,

130
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:24,280
well,
the world in as such experience as such

131
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:28,180
must be evil because it's predicated on
the blood of innocence,

132
00:08:28,181 --> 00:08:29,290
the suffering of children.

133
00:08:29,290 --> 00:08:33,190
The fact that there's vast injustices in
the world is indicative that there is no

134
00:08:33,191 --> 00:08:38,191
such thing as a good God or to speak
unless personified terms is evidence

135
00:08:38,261 --> 00:08:42,070
that the structure of experience as such
as an untenable morally,

136
00:08:42,310 --> 00:08:45,340
it shouldn't be because it's predicated
on suffering.

137
00:08:46,810 --> 00:08:47,950
Jeffrey Burton,
Russell,

138
00:08:47,951 --> 00:08:50,410
who's written a whole series of books on
the nature of evil,

139
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:55,580
makes a very clear distinction between
different categories of terrible that I

140
00:08:55,621 --> 00:08:57,690
hit.
I think help bring this into clarity,

141
00:08:57,810 --> 00:09:00,960
so imagine this.
Imagine first that it's useful to make a

142
00:09:00,961 --> 00:09:03,780
distinction between tragedy and evil.
Okay?

143
00:09:03,781 --> 00:09:08,781
Now tragedy is when the bad befalls the
good an earthquake is tragic.

144
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:12,600
So or diseases tragic.
Now it's easy to regard a disease or an

145
00:09:12,601 --> 00:09:14,850
earthquake as evil as well,
but the problem with that is that

146
00:09:14,851 --> 00:09:18,120
doesn't seem to be any motivation to it,
and so it's more likely,

147
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:19,860
it's more reasonable to think something
like,

148
00:09:19,861 --> 00:09:22,050
well,
people are vulnerable.

149
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:26,770
They have to be vulnerable in order to
give existence a viewpoint.

150
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:30,570
One of the consequences of their
vulnerability is that they're

151
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:32,460
susceptible to tragedy.

152
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,233
Okay.

153
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:38,030
If their vulnerability is a precondition
for being,

154
00:09:38,031 --> 00:09:41,230
then the fact that they're susceptible
to tragedy isn't necessarily an evil.

155
00:09:41,231 --> 00:09:44,050
It's just a consequence of their
limitation.

156
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:46,861
Then you say,
well,

157
00:09:46,861 --> 00:09:49,410
what constitutes evil?
If you can't put earthquakes and

158
00:09:49,411 --> 00:09:51,540
diseases and so forth into that
category,

159
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:55,350
well then it seems to be something more
dependent on choice,

160
00:09:55,410 --> 00:09:57,510
which is the argument that Elliot is
making.

161
00:09:57,511 --> 00:10:01,650
Say the world does all sorts of terrible
things to people,

162
00:10:01,651 --> 00:10:06,370
but there are frequent.
It's frequently the case that people act

163
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:08,930
in such a way to make things worse
rather than better.

164
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:12,950
Right?
So if you look at the consequences of

165
00:10:13,010 --> 00:10:15,370
the rise to power of the Nazis,
for example,

166
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:19,430
doesn't seem reasonable to put the Nazi
concentration camp in the same category

167
00:10:19,431 --> 00:10:21,860
from an ethical perspective as the
earthquake,

168
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:26,900
right?
Because the earthquake is and emergent

169
00:10:26,901 --> 00:10:30,590
consequence of the rules that governed
physical existence.

170
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,680
Whereas the Nazi death camp is something
that was planned.

171
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:38,120
It didn't have to be.
It seems to be an aspect of choice and

172
00:10:38,121 --> 00:10:42,610
this seems to be the idea that's lurking
underneath both this mythology and now

173
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:44,030
he had his comment on it.
It's

174
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:46,970
the mere fact that the world is
terrible,

175
00:10:46,971 --> 00:10:49,940
does not mean that it's evil,
but then when you look at specifically

176
00:10:49,941 --> 00:10:52,700
human actions,
there's this aspect of twisted choice

177
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:54,500
that fry also makes much of.
It says,

178
00:10:54,501 --> 00:10:56,240
if you.
If you look at the structure of human

179
00:10:56,241 --> 00:11:01,241
history and you try to explain why it
has such a bloody and terrible course,

180
00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:06,680
it doesn't seem sufficient just to
attribute it say to the conditions of

181
00:11:06,681 --> 00:11:11,540
existence or to ignorance it.
It seems more like there's a force

182
00:11:11,541 --> 00:11:12,770
behind it,
so to speak,

183
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:13,511
manifests,
say,

184
00:11:13,511 --> 00:11:18,230
and every individual that's actually
aiming at the suffering instead of just

185
00:11:18,231 --> 00:11:21,200
allowing it to happen or instead of not
stepping in to stop it,

186
00:11:21,201 --> 00:11:22,430
but actually aiming at it.
