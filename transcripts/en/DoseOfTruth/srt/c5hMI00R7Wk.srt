1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:04,550
It seems that we've moved away from
introspection and I think we are finding

2
00:00:04,551 --> 00:00:09,440
that the short term stimulus are pursuing
sense pleasures is not making up for

3
00:00:09,441 --> 00:00:11,090
the increasing hollowing out.

4
00:00:11,091 --> 00:00:12,920
I think of people's inner experiences.

5
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:14,381
Yeah.

6
00:00:14,381 --> 00:00:19,000
Well two things that that you said there
that that that struck a chord with me.

7
00:00:19,001 --> 00:00:20,110
The first was that

8
00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:23,650
with regards to external stimulation,

9
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:28,710
the question is is that if
you're continually bombarded
by the outside world,

10
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:30,790
it's telling you what to do all the time.

11
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:34,030
I gather people are always telling
you what to do when they talk to you.

12
00:00:34,031 --> 00:00:39,031
And of course advertisers and social
media are really like seriously and

13
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:41,710
explicitly telling you what to do.

14
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:43,330
And the question is,

15
00:00:43,331 --> 00:00:43,601
well,

16
00:00:43,601 --> 00:00:47,230
how do you decide what
you should do for you?

17
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:51,580
And the answer to that is that
you have to consult yourself.

18
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:56,320
And unless there's time to do that and
you consult yourself partly through the

19
00:00:56,321 --> 00:00:57,730
use of your imagination,

20
00:00:57,731 --> 00:01:01,780
daydreaming and daydreaming about what
the future might hold and then actually

21
00:01:01,781 --> 00:01:03,610
consciously thinking about it in planning.

22
00:01:03,611 --> 00:01:07,300
But you need to disconnect yourself from
the external stimulation in order to do

23
00:01:07,301 --> 00:01:07,540
that.

24
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:09,820
And it might take some time and so yes,

25
00:01:09,821 --> 00:01:11,800
I think that we're in
danger of losing now.

26
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:16,600
I think children are in danger of having
their play interfered with two and we

27
00:01:16,601 --> 00:01:18,580
don't know what the
consequences of that would be,

28
00:01:18,581 --> 00:01:22,750
but I don't suspect that it will
be the too much of that will be,

29
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:23,530
well,

30
00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:25,660
if that happens to to graded degree,

31
00:01:25,661 --> 00:01:27,220
the consequences will be negative.

32
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:29,410
And you also mentioned prayer,

33
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:31,420
you know the,

34
00:01:31,421 --> 00:01:36,010
the cynical attitude towards prayer is
something like asking God for favors.

35
00:01:36,011 --> 00:01:40,450
And then of course the cynical analysis
of that is that if you ask God for

36
00:01:40,451 --> 00:01:41,284
favors,

37
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:43,840
like he won't help you
find your lost wallet,

38
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:44,950
generally speaking,

39
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:46,330
you know,

40
00:01:46,330 --> 00:01:48,190
but that isn't,

41
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:49,121
if you're,

42
00:01:49,121 --> 00:01:51,700
if you take a bit of a more
sophisticated approach to it,

43
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:53,890
you know what you're doing.

44
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:55,030
If you pray,

45
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:56,703
we could even,

46
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:01,270
we'll seem to find that
more acceptable is that you,

47
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:03,550
you formulate a question and you,

48
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:05,050
you wait for an answer.

49
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:07,030
Like a prayer might be,

50
00:02:07,031 --> 00:02:07,864
okay,

51
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:11,290
I would like to do the best
thing I could with my life.

52
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:13,480
Now you have to open yourself up to that.

53
00:02:13,481 --> 00:02:14,231
That's to knock.

54
00:02:14,231 --> 00:02:15,310
So the door will open.

55
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:17,380
I would like to do the
best thing with my life.

56
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:19,360
What might that be?

57
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:21,640
Now you could say that you're thinking,

58
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:22,990
when you say that are you are,

59
00:02:22,991 --> 00:02:27,070
you could say that you're leaving
yourself open for a revelation or an

60
00:02:27,071 --> 00:02:27,904
intuition,

61
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:33,240
but you're communing with whatever it
is that enables you to receive wisdom.

62
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:36,010
And you can attribute all of that to you,

63
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:37,960
or you can attribute it to your brain,

64
00:02:37,961 --> 00:02:38,561
I suppose,

65
00:02:38,561 --> 00:02:39,440
but you're,

66
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:42,490
you're really communing with the
structure of the cosmos when you're,

67
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:44,260
when you're asking such a question,

68
00:02:44,261 --> 00:02:49,000
and especially if you do it properly and
it's really useful to do that and it's

69
00:02:49,001 --> 00:02:51,910
really necessary because
it orients you properly.

70
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:53,200
So yeah,

71
00:02:53,201 --> 00:02:57,190
the demise of prayer when prayer is
considered in a sophisticated manner,

72
00:02:57,940 --> 00:03:01,600
which is do I commune with
the better part of myself,

73
00:03:01,601 --> 00:03:02,434
let's say,

74
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:04,720
to determine how I should
orient myself in the world?

75
00:03:04,721 --> 00:03:06,820
It's a catastrophic loss not to do that.
