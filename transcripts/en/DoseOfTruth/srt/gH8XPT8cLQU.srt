1
00:00:07,610 --> 00:00:09,380
You often mentioned disciplining children,

2
00:00:09,381 --> 00:00:10,340
so they behave.

3
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:14,510
What is your advice for making them
behave without resorting to corporal

4
00:00:14,511 --> 00:00:15,344
punishment?

5
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:15,861
Well,

6
00:00:15,861 --> 00:00:16,311
first of all,

7
00:00:16,311 --> 00:00:18,350
it depends on what you mean
by corporal punishment.

8
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:19,430
Um,

9
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:21,770
timeout could be regarded
as corporal punishment.

10
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:24,560
It also depends very much
on the age of the child,

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:25,833
um,

12
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:26,990
at say a two year old,

13
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:28,033
well,

14
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:29,331
in my new book,

15
00:00:29,331 --> 00:00:30,164
by the way,

16
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:35,630
I have a chapter in there called don't
let your children do anything that makes

17
00:00:35,631 --> 00:00:36,530
you dislike them.

18
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:42,080
And the reason that I wrote a chapter
about that is because people who let their

19
00:00:42,081 --> 00:00:46,460
children do things that make them
dislike them end up disliking them.

20
00:00:46,461 --> 00:00:48,380
And because there's a
huge power differential,

21
00:00:48,381 --> 00:00:50,450
generally speaking between
adults and children,

22
00:00:50,451 --> 00:00:53,480
if you end up disliking your children
because they're not behaving well,

23
00:00:54,230 --> 00:00:55,880
they're behaving disgracefully say,

24
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:56,720
or they're,

25
00:00:56,720 --> 00:01:01,720
or they're challenging your position
in the authority hierarchy to regularly

26
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:03,830
something he won't put up with.

27
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:04,281
By the way,

28
00:01:04,281 --> 00:01:05,420
even if you think you will,

29
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:08,810
it's necessary to get your
disciplinary routine straight.

30
00:01:08,811 --> 00:01:13,160
So the first thing I would say
is figure out what the rules are.

31
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:14,960
There shouldn't be too many.

32
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:15,800
Um,

33
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:19,790
for two year olds basically
they have to know what no means.

34
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:25,150
And they also have to learn as
they approached three not to kick,

35
00:01:25,311 --> 00:01:28,310
hit bite or steel essentially.

36
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:30,830
Now it's easy to train a two year old,

37
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:35,030
but no means you can actually start
with a child that's only 13 months old.

38
00:01:35,031 --> 00:01:36,080
A child that can cry,

39
00:01:36,410 --> 00:01:38,330
let's say that or that can crawl.

40
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:42,110
Let's say that you have a child is
starting to crawl and wants to explore the

41
00:01:42,111 --> 00:01:42,381
house.

42
00:01:42,381 --> 00:01:46,610
So the first thing you do if you have any
sense is try to get rid of most things

43
00:01:46,611 --> 00:01:50,270
that the child could cause a
tremendous amount of trouble with,

44
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:50,990
uh,

45
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:51,410
to,

46
00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:55,220
to the things or to the child
so that it's reasonably safe.

47
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:56,593
Um,

48
00:01:57,050 --> 00:02:00,200
and then the child is going to want
to want to crawl around and get into

49
00:02:00,201 --> 00:02:00,681
everything.

50
00:02:00,681 --> 00:02:01,250
And so,

51
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:04,370
but maybe there are things you
don't want him or her to get into.

52
00:02:04,371 --> 00:02:05,880
Like maybe there's a uh,

53
00:02:07,010 --> 00:02:07,670
oh,

54
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:08,510
what would we say?

55
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:10,550
Maybe there's a tablecloth,

56
00:02:10,551 --> 00:02:12,290
and on top of the
tablecloth there's a plant,

57
00:02:12,291 --> 00:02:17,270
or maybe there's some plants on the
floor and when the child is crawling and

58
00:02:17,271 --> 00:02:19,820
goes off to do something
that he or she shouldn't,

59
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:20,660
um,

60
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:23,330
you can just grab his leg and you know,

61
00:02:23,331 --> 00:02:26,780
gently but firmly and say no.

62
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:30,560
And the child will keep trying to move
forward because they're stubborn little

63
00:02:30,561 --> 00:02:31,280
gliders.

64
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,990
And you can continue to say no.

65
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:36,650
And if you persist with saying no,

66
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:40,610
then the child will eventually
give up and sort of go limp.

67
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:42,020
Now,

68
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:44,960
now and often the child
will cry when you do that.

69
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:47,210
And of course that might
make you feel guilty,

70
00:02:47,211 --> 00:02:51,350
but what that means is that you've
effectively brought to behavior to a halt.

71
00:02:51,351 --> 00:02:53,930
And if you do that 10 times,

72
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:58,700
you've got to watch your child and don't
stop them from exploring things that

73
00:02:58,701 --> 00:02:59,830
they need to explore it.

74
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:03,070
You want to use this sort
of thing with judiciously.

75
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:05,590
You can grab them by the leg and say,

76
00:03:05,591 --> 00:03:06,350
no,

77
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:07,183
no,

78
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:08,223
no.

79
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:09,910
And wait until they give up.

80
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,010
Usually they'll cry and
then you can let them go.

81
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:13,390
And then soon after,

82
00:03:13,391 --> 00:03:14,920
you do that about 10 times soon.

83
00:03:14,921 --> 00:03:17,680
Then if you just say no
with the same tone of voice,

84
00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:19,600
the child will generally,

85
00:03:19,601 --> 00:03:20,090
what happens,

86
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:22,660
the child will immediately
cry and then stop.

87
00:03:22,661 --> 00:03:26,350
And then after about 10 repeats of
no without having the leg grabbed,

88
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:27,101
then no,

89
00:03:27,101 --> 00:03:30,100
we'll just produce
stopping of the behavior.

90
00:03:30,101 --> 00:03:33,310
And that's unbelievably useful
because as soon as your,

91
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:36,940
you train your child to
understand what no means,

92
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:42,180
then they really have free reign of
the house in some sense with relative

93
00:03:42,311 --> 00:03:43,810
minimal supervision from you.

94
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:44,441
First of all,

95
00:03:44,441 --> 00:03:46,450
they can learn what things
they're not supposed to get into.

96
00:03:46,451 --> 00:03:49,630
And it's amazing how fast children
can learn that and how fast they can

97
00:03:49,631 --> 00:03:53,050
generalize to the class of things
that they shouldn't get into.

98
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:55,000
Like you don't have to teach
them every single thing.

99
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:56,650
They can generalize very rapidly.

100
00:03:56,651 --> 00:03:58,210
That's not much different than thinking.

101
00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:03,100
But also once they are capable
of understanding what no means,

102
00:04:03,101 --> 00:04:07,840
you have an extremely potent means of
helping them regulate their behavior with

103
00:04:07,841 --> 00:04:09,220
a minimum of intervention.

104
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:11,050
So that's unbelievably useful.

105
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:15,940
So now let's say you have a two year old
who's pretty contentious and two year

106
00:04:15,941 --> 00:04:17,110
olds are pretty contentious.

107
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:20,200
Some of them in particular
because both 5% of two year olds,

108
00:04:20,201 --> 00:04:21,160
most of them are male,

109
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:23,200
are quite aggressive by temperament.

110
00:04:23,201 --> 00:04:26,530
And those are the ones that if you put
with other two year olds will frequently

111
00:04:26,531 --> 00:04:28,870
kick hit bite or steel.

112
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:30,160
Not all kids are like that,

113
00:04:30,161 --> 00:04:30,994
but some are,

114
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:34,240
and most of them get socialized out of
that by the time they're about four.

115
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:39,040
Now let's say you have an at two they
also start to experiment with saying no

116
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:41,410
back and also with misbehaving,

117
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:43,210
although they can do that
even younger than that.

118
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:47,770
So if you have a two year
old who's particularly
rambunctious and who decides he

119
00:04:47,771 --> 00:04:48,910
isn't going to listen to you,

120
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:52,360
we use [inaudible] in this example
because it's boys that are more likely to

121
00:04:52,361 --> 00:04:54,640
misbehave and not I not listen.

122
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:55,810
You can,

123
00:04:55,810 --> 00:05:00,010
you can pick them up and you know by
the arms now you gotta get your attitude

124
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:02,380
right because you don't want to be stupid.

125
00:05:02,381 --> 00:05:04,000
You don't want to let
your kid make you mad,

126
00:05:04,001 --> 00:05:07,390
especially when they're really little
cause you're really big and you can hurt

127
00:05:07,391 --> 00:05:07,541
them.

128
00:05:07,541 --> 00:05:08,374
And so you gotta,

129
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:09,790
you gotta have a clue.

130
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:12,220
That's why you want to get the
rules of discipline in order.

131
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:15,250
The minimum rules of discipline and
why you want to have a strategy.

132
00:05:15,251 --> 00:05:19,480
But let's say your two or two year old
is insisting upon doing something that

133
00:05:19,481 --> 00:05:20,560
you don't want him to do,

134
00:05:20,561 --> 00:05:20,950
like,

135
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:21,520
uh,

136
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:25,510
inserting a fork into an electrical
outlet and you just can't have that.

137
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:27,250
And so you can say no,

138
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:31,330
hopefully you've already done the
no training that I recommended.

139
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:32,710
And then if that doesn't work,

140
00:05:32,711 --> 00:05:36,430
what I recommend doing is picking the
child up by the arms and then putting them

141
00:05:36,431 --> 00:05:37,330
on the steps.

142
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:37,961
Say,

143
00:05:37,961 --> 00:05:38,171
look,

144
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:41,200
you sit there until
you're ready to listen.

145
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:42,410
Now,

146
00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:43,070
um,

147
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:47,050
are usually the child will sit there and
then the rule has to be something like

148
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:50,570
you can get up as soon as you're ready
to be a civilized human being again.

149
00:05:50,571 --> 00:05:52,450
And you can refer to yourself,

150
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:55,360
your own attitude during
a process like that.

151
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,970
Because if the child does comply and sits
on the steps and then comes and says,

152
00:05:58,971 --> 00:05:59,900
I'm ready to be good,

153
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:01,340
and you like them again,

154
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,690
you've got to be honest about this,

155
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:07,820
then you can tell that he's honest in
his decision to rejoin the civilized

156
00:06:07,821 --> 00:06:08,654
world.

157
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:12,320
Now sometimes if you put a two year old
that's particularly rambunctious on the

158
00:06:12,321 --> 00:06:13,154
staircase,

159
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,660
that as soon as you let go of their arms,

160
00:06:14,661 --> 00:06:15,500
they'll run off.

161
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,470
And that can be a game or it
can just be an act of defiance.

162
00:06:18,471 --> 00:06:22,220
And in that case then you go get him and
he put them back on the steps and you

163
00:06:22,221 --> 00:06:24,500
do that several times if necessary.

164
00:06:24,501 --> 00:06:24,891
And if that,

165
00:06:24,891 --> 00:06:25,940
that becomes a game,

166
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:29,090
then you sit on the step and
you hold him by the arms.

167
00:06:29,091 --> 00:06:30,950
Remember no anger cause he's just too,

168
00:06:30,951 --> 00:06:31,731
for God's sake,

169
00:06:31,731 --> 00:06:31,911
you know,

170
00:06:31,911 --> 00:06:34,790
you don't have to be angry is put
them on the steps and hold up.

171
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:35,031
Say,

172
00:06:35,031 --> 00:06:35,780
look,

173
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:39,800
I'm not letting you go until
you sit there and behave.

174
00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:41,120
And so if you hold them for a while,

175
00:06:41,121 --> 00:06:42,890
he'll squirm and look away and so forth.

176
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:43,821
But you can get a visit.

177
00:06:43,821 --> 00:06:44,211
Tension.

178
00:06:44,211 --> 00:06:45,350
If you're a little bit stubborn,

179
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:48,410
you hold them there and say you're going
to sit there until I decide that you

180
00:06:48,411 --> 00:06:49,460
can leave.

181
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:51,860
And so you hold them and he'll squirm and,

182
00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:53,780
but you can outwait them if your patient,

183
00:06:53,781 --> 00:06:56,930
but you got to make the time and then
eventually he'll stop squirming and you

184
00:06:56,931 --> 00:06:57,764
can let them go.

185
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,750
And then you can sit there and watch him.

186
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:04,640
And when you think he's decided that
he's going to be a civilized creature,

187
00:07:04,641 --> 00:07:07,820
then you can say that's good and you can
give them a pat on the head and you can

188
00:07:07,821 --> 00:07:08,001
say,

189
00:07:08,001 --> 00:07:09,500
let's go back and do what we're doing.

190
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,000
And the rule has to be,

191
00:07:11,001 --> 00:07:15,860
you see that the punishment not only has
to bring the behavior to a halt in the

192
00:07:15,861 --> 00:07:17,690
most merciful manner possible,

193
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,280
but that's still effective.

194
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:24,260
But it also has to satisfy your need
for order and justice so that you don't

195
00:07:24,261 --> 00:07:29,261
carry resentment and irritation about
the child's misbehavior forward with you

196
00:07:29,661 --> 00:07:33,080
because you don't want a kid yourself
about what sort of Nice person you are.

197
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:35,270
You're not nearly as nice
a person as you think.

198
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:36,680
And no one likes to be,

199
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:37,783
um,

200
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:42,140
brought down the authority hierarchy
by a recalcitrant two year old.

201
00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:45,290
So in almost all circumstances,

202
00:07:45,291 --> 00:07:47,720
those processes will suffice.

203
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:49,063
Um,

204
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:52,340
there's other disciplinary strategies
that you can use to that are more

205
00:07:52,341 --> 00:07:53,001
positive.

206
00:07:53,001 --> 00:07:53,451
I mean,

207
00:07:53,451 --> 00:07:54,860
one of the things that you can do,

208
00:07:54,861 --> 00:07:55,521
for example,

209
00:07:55,521 --> 00:07:56,354
if you're,

210
00:07:57,650 --> 00:07:59,690
let's say you want to get
your child to go to bed,

211
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:01,160
which is a really good idea,

212
00:08:01,161 --> 00:08:03,530
you should set a stable
bedtime for your child.

213
00:08:03,531 --> 00:08:05,120
And I would say if they're under four,

214
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:08,810
it should be around eight or
seven or something like that.

215
00:08:08,810 --> 00:08:11,870
Because you want to have a life and you
want to have a life with your wife so

216
00:08:11,871 --> 00:08:14,480
that you don't end up hating your child.

217
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:18,590
And so one of the things you can do if
you want to train your child to go to bed

218
00:08:18,591 --> 00:08:18,951
at eight,

219
00:08:18,951 --> 00:08:23,630
so maybe he's not going to bed until
10 right now and you want to fix that.

220
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:24,231
So you say,

221
00:08:24,231 --> 00:08:24,561
okay,

222
00:08:24,561 --> 00:08:28,700
go to the grocery store or a little
convenience store and buy 10 little gifts.

223
00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:30,291
And it can be cheap.

224
00:08:30,291 --> 00:08:31,124
Kids don't care.

225
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:32,090
They're not very bright.

226
00:08:32,091 --> 00:08:32,420
You know,

227
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:36,020
you could fool them so by 10 little
things that you think your kid would like

228
00:08:36,021 --> 00:08:40,070
and wrap them up and then put them up
on a shelf where he can see them at,

229
00:08:40,071 --> 00:08:40,904
can't get at them.

230
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:42,323
Then you say,

231
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:43,310
look kid,

232
00:08:43,310 --> 00:08:46,340
I'm going to put you to bed
at nine 30 tonight and uh,

233
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:50,990
if you don't get out of bed then
I'm going to give you one of these.

234
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:53,180
I'm going to give you one of
these gifts in the morning.

235
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:54,793
So,

236
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:55,500
or if the,

237
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:56,880
or you can do it another way too.

238
00:08:56,881 --> 00:08:59,700
If the child is always giving you a rough
time about getting ready for bed and

239
00:08:59,701 --> 00:09:00,211
going to bed,

240
00:09:00,211 --> 00:09:00,631
you can say,

241
00:09:00,631 --> 00:09:00,841
look,

242
00:09:00,841 --> 00:09:01,530
if you're,

243
00:09:01,530 --> 00:09:05,460
if you put on your pajamas without
fussing and you climb into bed,

244
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:07,470
they'll give you one
of these little gifts.

245
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,300
And so then if that works,

246
00:09:09,301 --> 00:09:12,720
then the child can have a little gift
and he's in bed at nine 30 and then you

247
00:09:12,721 --> 00:09:15,630
can make it nine and then you can make
it eight 30 and then you can make it

248
00:09:15,631 --> 00:09:17,130
eight and those are called,

249
00:09:17,131 --> 00:09:18,900
that's called success of approximation,

250
00:09:18,901 --> 00:09:19,111
right?

251
00:09:19,111 --> 00:09:19,944
You hit the target,

252
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:24,360
you specify the target that you want
the child to achieve and then use small

253
00:09:24,361 --> 00:09:25,110
rewards,

254
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:28,230
not too often in order
to attain that goal.

255
00:09:28,231 --> 00:09:31,770
And those are unbelievably effective
strategies and they can actually be pretty

256
00:09:31,771 --> 00:09:32,400
fun.

257
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:36,750
But I would say the advice to not let
your child do anything that makes you

258
00:09:36,751 --> 00:09:37,890
dislike them is really,

259
00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:39,780
really useful.

260
00:09:40,210 --> 00:09:40,920
Um,

261
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,780
you want to talk this over
with your partner too,

262
00:09:42,781 --> 00:09:47,430
so that you have your
disciplinary strategies and
your rules talked out so that

263
00:09:47,431 --> 00:09:49,410
you don't work at cross
purposes to one another.

264
00:09:49,710 --> 00:09:50,543
So,

265
00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:51,330
okay,

266
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:53,040
so that's probably good enough for that.
