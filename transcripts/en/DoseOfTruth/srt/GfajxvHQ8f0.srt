1
00:00:01,060 --> 00:00:02,640
Please welcome to the stage.

2
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:14,270
[inaudible]

3
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:00,920
I

4
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:11,980
was just thinking about stage,

5
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:22,710
trying to figure out what I'm going to
dive into because I use these folks as an

6
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:29,090
opportunity to the more deeply
into what I've been thinking about.

7
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:31,580
I'm going to talk to you about,

8
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:32,341
we spoke,

9
00:01:32,341 --> 00:01:33,960
I wrote 12 rules for life.

10
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:35,390
Let me say it,

11
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:37,220
but I don't,

12
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:39,530
I'm not parroting the books.

13
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:39,750
No,

14
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:43,270
I'm trying to make what
I'm thinking about clearer.

15
00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:48,120
I was thinking maybe a little
story before it can for the talk,

16
00:01:48,121 --> 00:01:50,680
but what exactly is it that we're
going to address and I thought,

17
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:51,310
well,

18
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:53,900
I'm going to interest with
relationship between perception,

19
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:54,743
reality.

20
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:59,100
I thought that's a very serious problem
and it's so funny with the city at the

21
00:01:59,101 --> 00:02:01,620
back of the stage and think back to them.

22
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:02,430
12 here,

23
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:02,870
welcome.

24
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:07,870
Like go and see [inaudible] listen
to be carved for 70 minutes about,

25
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,220
it's a philosophical discussion,

26
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:17,000
really psychological discussion as well.

27
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:20,610
The relationship between perception and
reality of who would have thought that

28
00:02:20,611 --> 00:02:22,200
would be like a popular thing,

29
00:02:22,201 --> 00:02:22,830
you know?

30
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:23,330
And so,

31
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:24,370
but I think it's a thing.

32
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:25,480
It's screening something.

33
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:26,663
Yeah.

34
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:31,940
Well reserve obviously a hunger that's
the unmet for some reason for serious his

35
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:37,290
and that's great.

36
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,500
So that's what we're going to do.

37
00:02:38,501 --> 00:02:40,470
We're going to have some
written give tonight.

38
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:41,820
So

39
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,960
I'm going to stumble
around with a bit tonight.

40
00:02:45,961 --> 00:02:49,350
I think because this is a very difficult
topic that I have gotten completely

41
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:50,220
clear in my head.

42
00:02:50,221 --> 00:02:50,730
So,

43
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:50,840
uh,

44
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:53,400
hope you have to make this
as coherent as possible.

45
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:59,380
See if what I'm going to be trying to
solve at least to some degree is the

46
00:02:59,951 --> 00:03:00,460
problem

47
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:04,840
of the relationship
between value and reality.

48
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:09,190
We live in a world of value where
things have gotten that material reality

49
00:03:09,191 --> 00:03:11,950
itself cause the teeth to
have any intrinsic value,

50
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:12,461
right?

51
00:03:12,461 --> 00:03:13,294
It's sort of,

52
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:18,330
it's there and so objective and in
some sense whatever value there is we

53
00:03:19,601 --> 00:03:21,550
attribute to the world.

54
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:23,620
That's one way of looking at it anyways.

55
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:25,440
And that,

56
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:26,040
uh,

57
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:30,550
that that opens up questions
about the reality of value.

58
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:31,991
It also,

59
00:03:31,991 --> 00:03:33,340
so that's one thing I want to address.

60
00:03:33,341 --> 00:03:36,160
The problem I want to
address is how it is.

61
00:03:36,161 --> 00:03:41,161
The perception is even possible because
the world is an insanely complicated

62
00:03:41,591 --> 00:03:42,280
place.

63
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:45,040
Like it's so complicated that it's really,

64
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:49,180
it's really beyond comprehension
and so it is going is how it is to,

65
00:03:49,210 --> 00:03:52,450
you can comprehend until that you
could perceive it because it's actually

66
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:53,293
beyond,

67
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:54,131
it's so complex.

68
00:03:54,131 --> 00:03:56,630
It's beyond your ability to proceed.

69
00:03:56,790 --> 00:03:57,400
So,

70
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:01,150
so I'm trying to solve two problems at
the same time is how in the world do you

71
00:04:01,151 --> 00:04:06,151
manage this incredibly difficult job of
perception and what role does value that

72
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:08,830
the idea of value,

73
00:04:08,831 --> 00:04:11,560
the idea that one thing is
worth more than another,

74
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:13,540
what role does that play in that?

75
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,051
You might say,

76
00:04:14,051 --> 00:04:15,590
well why is that so relevant?

77
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:15,870
Well,

78
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:16,120
it's,

79
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:18,660
it's exactly relevant
because if the problems,

80
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:19,810
problem relevance,

81
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:24,670
you have to assume that one thing is more
important than another before you can

82
00:04:24,671 --> 00:04:25,360
do anything.

83
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:30,360
Because to do something means that you
privileged that thing above all the other

84
00:04:30,701 --> 00:04:31,810
things that you could be doing,

85
00:04:31,811 --> 00:04:32,740
you value anymore.

86
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,730
So without imposing a value structure
on the world are discovering one within

87
00:04:36,731 --> 00:04:37,564
the world.

88
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,190
I don't know which of those is true.

89
00:04:39,191 --> 00:04:41,150
You can't eat an act if you have to add,

90
00:04:41,151 --> 00:04:42,530
so you're stuck with it,

91
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:43,650
stuck with them.

92
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:46,960
It's not poured so much.

93
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:49,150
You start with the problem of value.

94
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:50,351
Okay,

95
00:04:50,351 --> 00:04:53,530
so we're going to walk through them
and see if like I'm tangled up.

96
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:54,280
And there's,

97
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:55,420
I guess the third issue too,

98
00:04:55,421 --> 00:04:59,920
we just given that you have
to value things in order to,

99
00:04:59,921 --> 00:05:04,921
after that you have to act in
what should you fail you and so,

100
00:05:05,051 --> 00:05:07,330
and how is that related to tell
you should perceive the world.

101
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:07,601
Okay,

102
00:05:07,601 --> 00:05:08,920
so that's the kind of press,

103
00:05:08,921 --> 00:05:10,060
the problem space,

104
00:05:10,061 --> 00:05:12,120
let's say that we're going to investigate,

105
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:17,080
and this is related to chapter 10 which
is beat precise in your speech was just

106
00:05:17,081 --> 00:05:20,380
an attempt in 12 rules for
life to lay some of this out.

107
00:05:20,381 --> 00:05:23,890
So the first thing I want to point out is,

108
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:25,670
is some peculiarities of Oak.

109
00:05:25,671 --> 00:05:26,920
We perceive the world.

110
00:05:26,921 --> 00:05:30,490
So we can tell the story first about
famous psychological experiment that was

111
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:31,990
run by Dan Simon.

112
00:05:31,991 --> 00:05:33,460
I'm going to go through it pretty quickly.

113
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:37,810
It's an experiment that has to do with
a phenomenal that Simon called changed

114
00:05:37,811 --> 00:05:38,440
blindness.

115
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,860
I don't think he invented the term.

116
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,690
I think it's supervised but doesn't have
it for our purposes or what Simon did.

117
00:05:43,691 --> 00:05:45,260
He made this vision and
most of you have seen it.

118
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,113
I'd take,

119
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:51,230
he put six people in front of an
elevator in a psychology lab and uh,

120
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:54,390
he had three of them dressed in black,

121
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:56,890
300 dressed in wiping the black team,

122
00:05:56,910 --> 00:05:57,850
Heather basketball.

123
00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:02,840
And the white team had a basketball and
the way team was sort of dance around

124
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:04,970
and passing the basketball back and forth.

125
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,100
So it was black team.

126
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:09,140
They had their own basketball and
your job was coming to fill out,

127
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:09,680
sit down,

128
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,513
watch the video,

129
00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:13,370
count the number of times with the
white teeth through the basketball,

130
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:14,320
back and forth.

131
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:16,310
Now it's all you have to do now.

132
00:06:16,311 --> 00:06:16,980
So you,

133
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:20,120
you go to magic committed
your state of mind.

134
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:20,811
You do that.

135
00:06:20,811 --> 00:06:22,610
So you've come to the lab,

136
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:24,920
you've come to participate
in the scientific experiment,

137
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,870
you've come to following instructions,

138
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:30,740
and you've come at least in principle
to demonstrate that you're capable of

139
00:06:30,741 --> 00:06:31,850
doing all those things.

140
00:06:31,851 --> 00:06:32,270
Right.

141
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:34,840
I'd be somewhat intimidating
to come into the lab like that.

142
00:06:34,841 --> 00:06:38,000
And you want to do a good job and maybe
you want to do a good job because we

143
00:06:38,001 --> 00:06:39,290
want to be a competent person.

144
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,660
And the reason I'm telling them all that
it's because you've got to think about

145
00:06:41,661 --> 00:06:44,750
why you would follow the
instructions and you do.

146
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:45,171
Okay.

147
00:06:45,171 --> 00:06:48,800
Because it turns out that the fact that
you follow the instructions is very,

148
00:06:48,801 --> 00:06:51,230
very important in this
particular demonstration.

149
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:54,800
So you sit down in a video
unfolds trying to do,

150
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:57,770
the people in the any org are quite large,

151
00:06:57,771 --> 00:07:01,100
like they still the whole street so
they're not way off in the distance.

152
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:02,900
That's important because what happens,

153
00:07:02,901 --> 00:07:07,300
it's so Simon starts the video room rents
for about three minutes and the white

154
00:07:07,301 --> 00:07:12,301
team is wound around folks in
the basketball and throwing
it back and forth and

155
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:15,650
you're watching them and you're competent.

156
00:07:15,651 --> 00:07:15,950
One,

157
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:16,760
two,

158
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:17,121
three,

159
00:07:17,121 --> 00:07:17,980
four and safety.

160
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:20,490
You're doing a fine job and
he'll turn into doing a fine job.

161
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,960
You run up the whole three minutes
and have the extra vendor says,

162
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:27,970
how many times did the way teams
are the basketball back and forth.

163
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:31,310
You say 16 and he says,

164
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:31,851
correct.

165
00:07:31,851 --> 00:07:34,010
And he was thinking he
great day stuff now.

166
00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:34,610
So,

167
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:35,181
and then he says,

168
00:07:35,181 --> 00:07:35,331
well,

169
00:07:35,331 --> 00:07:39,050
can you see anything peculiar when you say

170
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:41,091
no,

171
00:07:41,091 --> 00:07:42,440
what do you mean peculiar?

172
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:43,640
He says,

173
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:43,791
well,

174
00:07:43,791 --> 00:07:45,260
did you see the gorilla?

175
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:46,881
Right?

176
00:07:46,881 --> 00:07:47,290
And,

177
00:07:47,290 --> 00:07:48,680
and you say,

178
00:07:48,770 --> 00:07:49,603
well what do you mean?

179
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:51,350
Did I see the gorilla?

180
00:07:51,730 --> 00:07:52,820
There was no gorilla.

181
00:07:53,170 --> 00:07:54,050
And so Simon says,

182
00:07:54,051 --> 00:07:54,381
okay,

183
00:07:54,381 --> 00:07:55,820
watch the video again,

184
00:07:56,030 --> 00:07:57,170
this type don't count.

185
00:07:57,950 --> 00:08:01,990
Sort of rewinds it plays it
like a minute into the video.

186
00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:02,863
Three minute video.

187
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:05,750
This guy comes in front
of the left of the screen,

188
00:08:05,751 --> 00:08:06,830
he's like six foot four.

189
00:08:06,831 --> 00:08:07,361
He has a girl,

190
00:08:07,361 --> 00:08:08,194
a signal,

191
00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:10,340
it walks right into the
middle of the video,

192
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:14,720
right in the center and beats
his chest for five seconds,

193
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:15,711
like gorillas,

194
00:08:15,711 --> 00:08:16,950
do these type of things.

195
00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:18,830
And then he saw Joe's office.

196
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:18,971
No,

197
00:08:18,971 --> 00:08:19,230
got you.

198
00:08:19,230 --> 00:08:20,330
Just as if it's a cross.

199
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:24,200
He was soldiers out of beaches
chest quite confidently.

200
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:26,210
And then one just off to the side.

201
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:31,630
And about 60% of the people who
watch that video don't see the grill.

202
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:35,800
And so some of you have watched that
video and make you so the grill,

203
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:36,510
maybe you did it.

204
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:36,630
He,

205
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:39,830
that he made a follow up video for all
those people who thought they'd learned

206
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:43,550
their lesson the first time they
watched the video in this video.

207
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:47,870
The same thing happens except
when the gorilla comes out.

208
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:49,760
Now people are crying for that.

209
00:08:49,761 --> 00:08:50,740
Ain't that caps the grill,

210
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:55,930
the curtains behind changed from red to
gold and one of the team players leaves.

211
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:57,770
And so,

212
00:08:57,770 --> 00:08:58,603
you know,

213
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:01,250
he asks you to start
retrieving all smart vote,

214
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:04,710
whether or not you're sewing things
strange when you see the gorilla and he

215
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:05,491
rewinds it says,

216
00:09:05,491 --> 00:09:05,671
yeah,

217
00:09:05,671 --> 00:09:07,640
but you see the curt and change color.

218
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:08,940
But the curtain name,

219
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,250
not just the curve,

220
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:12,780
but that you missed that completely.

221
00:09:12,781 --> 00:09:14,820
And it is the fact that someone left.

222
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:15,750
It's like,

223
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:17,310
so even when you know you're blind,

224
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:18,300
you're still blind.

225
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,790
And Simon's done stranger things to that.

226
00:09:20,791 --> 00:09:23,070
So one of the experiments he did Harvard,

227
00:09:23,071 --> 00:09:24,150
which is a great experiment,

228
00:09:24,151 --> 00:09:26,100
is to put a camera on top of a building,

229
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:27,600
is building Hartford Yard,

230
00:09:27,601 --> 00:09:27,901
which is,

231
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:28,440
uh,

232
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,100
the,

233
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:31,710
the basic central point from the campus.

234
00:09:31,711 --> 00:09:36,600
And there's lots of people out there
to have an undergraduate going up to a

235
00:09:36,601 --> 00:09:39,540
tourist for the map
and ask for directions.

236
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:40,141
Okay,

237
00:09:40,141 --> 00:09:43,530
so now to undergraduate here,

238
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:44,070
tourists,

239
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:46,770
they're asking directions with the map.

240
00:09:46,771 --> 00:09:47,970
Now over here,

241
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,180
there are two workmen and
holding the door like this.

242
00:09:51,181 --> 00:09:52,170
So here's the door.

243
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:53,320
It's can't see the word,

244
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:53,880
right?

245
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:54,750
Cause the door covers,

246
00:09:54,850 --> 00:09:56,610
there's one at the front
and one at the bat.

247
00:09:56,670 --> 00:10:00,180
And so undergraduate tourist workman,

248
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:04,830
they walked right in between the
tourist and the undergraduate.

249
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:06,173
And then the undergrounds,

250
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,500
if he's asking for directions,

251
00:10:07,501 --> 00:10:10,500
grabs the door and keeps on walking.

252
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,440
And one of the work grabs
the map of stands there.

253
00:10:13,441 --> 00:10:16,110
So basically what he's
done is swap people.

254
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:21,950
And both 60% of the tourists who were
being asked for directions don't notice

255
00:10:22,051 --> 00:10:24,540
that they're now talking
to a different person.

256
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:26,311
Great.

257
00:10:26,311 --> 00:10:27,750
So well.

258
00:10:27,751 --> 00:10:29,540
So that's how blind you are and you,

259
00:10:29,570 --> 00:10:31,200
you are a staggeringly blind.

260
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:33,990
It's amazing that you can
make it in the world at all.

261
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:34,681
In fact,

262
00:10:34,681 --> 00:10:38,230
most of what you've seen when you look
at the road is actually your memory and

263
00:10:38,231 --> 00:10:38,881
not the world.

264
00:10:38,881 --> 00:10:42,450
Because your brain uses your memory of
things to fill in what you don't see it

265
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:45,750
as we've already demonstrated
because you didn't see the gorilla.

266
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:47,210
God only knows what you're missing.

267
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:52,400
And that's the critical issue with regards
to that experiment is like who knows

268
00:10:53,761 --> 00:10:54,780
what you're missing.

269
00:10:55,270 --> 00:10:57,030
And the thing that's so crucial,

270
00:10:57,031 --> 00:10:57,331
here's,

271
00:10:57,331 --> 00:10:58,970
here's where value plays into it.

272
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,790
This is why maybe a case of
you follow the instructions.

273
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:03,653
It's like,

274
00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:06,490
well why didn't you see the
gorilla announcer as well?

275
00:11:06,491 --> 00:11:10,110
And you were counting the
basketballs and the question is,

276
00:11:10,111 --> 00:11:12,150
well why were you
counting the basketballs?

277
00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:15,300
And that's that is cause you
were following instructions.

278
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,380
And then the question is,

279
00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:16,620
well,

280
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:18,570
why are you following instructions?

281
00:11:18,571 --> 00:11:20,040
Instead of paying attention,

282
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:21,600
let's say to the gorilla,

283
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:23,190
which seems more relevant and say,

284
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:25,440
well why were you following
instructions anyways?

285
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:25,920
Well,

286
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,080
you're trying to be a
good experimental subject.

287
00:11:28,081 --> 00:11:30,630
I guess maybe you're
trying not to look stupid,

288
00:11:30,631 --> 00:11:32,130
you're trying to do the DAS property.

289
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,390
Why is that?

290
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:36,270
Well maybe you want to demonstrate
that you're a competent person.

291
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:38,910
So like why is that so important to you?

292
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:40,140
You see,

293
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:44,280
the reason I'm asking all these
questions is because the way that your

294
00:11:44,281 --> 00:11:48,780
perception was structured in
that experiment is dependent
on all the values that

295
00:11:48,781 --> 00:11:51,590
you brought to the perceptual
act and experience.

296
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:53,290
All of those things work.

297
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:57,400
Focusing your attention on what
it was that you focused on.

298
00:11:57,610 --> 00:11:58,380
And that was the,

299
00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:00,280
the balls and not the gorilla.

300
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:03,130
And so those are all issues of value.

301
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:06,190
The only reason that you've come to the
ball if it was because you thought that

302
00:12:06,191 --> 00:12:08,530
was the most important thing
to do in that circumstance.

303
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:12,520
So that was what you valued above
all else in that circumstance.

304
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:16,960
And so what that shows is that what
you value determines what you see.

305
00:12:17,650 --> 00:12:18,880
Now I should say,

306
00:12:18,881 --> 00:12:23,881
I should just stand here and repeat
that phrase to you for the next hour and

307
00:12:24,401 --> 00:12:25,234
then leave.

308
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:26,320
Right?

309
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,150
Because that's so,

310
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:32,150
it's so important that it's so mind
boggling that this experiment was a

311
00:12:32,501 --> 00:12:34,990
bombshell in psychology for
a whole bunch of reasons,

312
00:12:34,991 --> 00:12:38,650
but it was also a popular bombshell
because almost how many of you have seen

313
00:12:38,651 --> 00:12:39,484
that video,

314
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:40,070
you know?

315
00:12:40,070 --> 00:12:40,310
Yeah.

316
00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:41,143
It was towards you,

317
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:41,441
right?

318
00:12:41,441 --> 00:12:45,150
It's like how many other psychology
experiment videos that you've watched?

319
00:12:45,151 --> 00:12:46,270
Like zero.

320
00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:47,021
This one,

321
00:12:47,021 --> 00:12:50,370
everyone who's watched and
now no other questions.

322
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:52,330
Have you watched the old by anyone ever,

323
00:12:52,570 --> 00:12:55,810
and so that just shows you how
I've seen the mind boggling.

324
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:57,610
This is almost not exactly,

325
00:12:57,890 --> 00:12:58,450
it's not me.

326
00:12:58,450 --> 00:12:59,580
It's so shocking.

327
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:00,431
It can be the case,

328
00:13:00,431 --> 00:13:05,260
but it's actually even more shocking than
just the revelation that you're blind

329
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:06,320
because that's bad.

330
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,180
Not because you think,

331
00:13:07,181 --> 00:13:08,470
of course I'd seen the gap grill.

332
00:13:08,471 --> 00:13:08,771
It's like,

333
00:13:08,771 --> 00:13:08,921
no,

334
00:13:08,921 --> 00:13:11,800
you go and buy.

335
00:13:11,970 --> 00:13:14,210
But that isn't even a
thing that's most my,

336
00:13:14,430 --> 00:13:19,390
but what's most of the most mind boggling
in it about it is that it was the best

337
00:13:19,391 --> 00:13:23,430
illustration that psychologist had ever
managed about in some sense about the

338
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,550
structure of perception.

339
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:30,070
But even more importantly about the fact
that your perception is conditioned by

340
00:13:30,071 --> 00:13:31,120
your values.

341
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:35,260
And so we're going to delve into that
a little bit because the thing is,

342
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:37,390
what are the things you
might ask yourself is

343
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:41,410
if you miss the gorilla,

344
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:42,760
we also use music.

345
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:45,160
And then you might ask yourself,

346
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:45,551
well,

347
00:13:45,551 --> 00:13:47,590
are you missing something in your life?

348
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:48,880
And you know,

349
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,740
the answer to them is often yes.

350
00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:52,670
And then the question arises,

351
00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:53,523
well,

352
00:13:54,210 --> 00:13:55,480
if you're missing something in your life,

353
00:13:55,510 --> 00:13:57,370
maybe you're aiming at the wrong thing.

354
00:13:57,910 --> 00:14:00,100
If you're valuing the wrong thing,

355
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,320
so you're blind to what you need.

356
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,820
And the world is very complicated place.

357
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:05,800
There's lots in it.

358
00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:08,110
And if you're missing something important,

359
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,000
it might be because you're not eating,

360
00:14:10,001 --> 00:14:11,240
you'd have the right thing.

361
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:11,680
Like,

362
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:14,170
and it really might be that.

363
00:14:14,510 --> 00:14:15,101
That's the thing.

364
00:14:15,101 --> 00:14:15,940
That's what they meant.

365
00:14:15,941 --> 00:14:17,470
So deadly about that experiment.

366
00:14:18,010 --> 00:14:22,680
Now that is the only thing that
experiment isn't the only experiments that

367
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:24,760
experiment that demonstrates
this sort of thing.

368
00:14:25,210 --> 00:14:30,210
There's convergent evidence supporting
this line of thinking for all sorts of

369
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:33,340
disparate areas of psychology,

370
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:34,020
psychology,

371
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:34,631
perception.

372
00:14:34,631 --> 00:14:35,450
So,

373
00:14:35,450 --> 00:14:36,283
um,

374
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:40,390
the first other piece of evidence is this.

375
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:42,730
You have the music,

376
00:14:42,731 --> 00:14:44,380
perceptual resources.

377
00:14:44,890 --> 00:14:47,380
And so especially for vision,

378
00:14:47,410 --> 00:14:48,490
because vision is really,

379
00:14:48,491 --> 00:14:51,160
really narrowly intensive.

380
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,850
So you mostly,

381
00:14:52,851 --> 00:14:53,720
when you look at the world,

382
00:14:53,721 --> 00:14:55,820
we mostly use the center of your eye.

383
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,570
It's called the fold the on and lets
the high resolution part of your eye.

384
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:03,170
Now you know the difference between a
high resolution and a low resolution

385
00:15:03,171 --> 00:15:03,501
image.

386
00:15:03,501 --> 00:15:07,550
A high resolution image has lots of
Fiji on a low resolution image has less

387
00:15:07,551 --> 00:15:08,060
detailed.

388
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:10,140
So if you look straight ahead,

389
00:15:10,170 --> 00:15:10,650
electrify,

390
00:15:10,650 --> 00:15:11,180
look at,

391
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:15,560
and maybe I'll look at you so I
can see your face quite clear.

392
00:15:15,770 --> 00:15:19,130
I know you have a face but I can't see it.

393
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:19,521
You,

394
00:15:19,521 --> 00:15:20,840
you're just a blur.

395
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:26,120
You I can just see the fact that
your face is like your shirt is dark.

396
00:15:26,121 --> 00:15:28,040
I can't see you people at all.

397
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,150
I know you're there.

398
00:15:29,210 --> 00:15:29,451
I can,

399
00:15:29,451 --> 00:15:32,960
I'm not letting my eyes cream tonight
really can't see you people at all either.

400
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:36,080
So my digital space is
limited to about that much.

401
00:15:36,290 --> 00:15:36,980
And the part,

402
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:40,730
the sharp enough to actually see
a face is limited to your face.

403
00:15:40,731 --> 00:15:42,590
Cause I can tell you have eyes,

404
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:44,060
especially if you move the,

405
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:47,570
because I'm pretty good at
detecting motion in my periphery,

406
00:15:47,571 --> 00:15:49,070
but I can't tell anything else about,

407
00:15:49,071 --> 00:15:50,180
you can't really,

408
00:15:50,181 --> 00:15:51,380
I think your shirts blue,

409
00:15:51,381 --> 00:15:52,214
I think it is.

410
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:52,851
So anyways,

411
00:15:52,851 --> 00:15:54,920
now each of the neurons,

412
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:57,860
each of the cells in the phobia,

413
00:15:58,340 --> 00:16:02,300
which is the high resolution department
connected to 10,000 cells in the primary

414
00:16:02,301 --> 00:16:03,470
visual cortex.

415
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:07,280
And then they're connected
to infinite numbers of cells,

416
00:16:07,281 --> 00:16:08,630
virtually about that.

417
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:12,680
The reason I'm telling you that is
because for the old tissue is neurally

418
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:13,700
expensive.

419
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:18,940
And so if I needed my whole visual field
to be as high resolution as my phobia,

420
00:16:19,581 --> 00:16:23,210
that I'd have to have a head like at ain't
[inaudible] and that will be on doing

421
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:24,073
so.

422
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:24,861
Right?

423
00:16:24,861 --> 00:16:25,520
So,

424
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:27,500
so what we do is we make
the most of what we,

425
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:30,650
what we have and we'd Gardner
eyes around all the time.

426
00:16:30,651 --> 00:16:34,940
So we're just sticking around is around
like now taking snapshots of things and

427
00:16:34,941 --> 00:16:39,260
stitching them together very quickly and
it gives us the illusion that we have

428
00:16:39,261 --> 00:16:40,730
the complete field of vision.

429
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:42,680
It's not just an illusion,

430
00:16:42,681 --> 00:16:42,951
you know,

431
00:16:42,951 --> 00:16:46,580
because obviously you could walk across
the street most of the time to be hit by

432
00:16:46,581 --> 00:16:47,990
anything that's moving too quickly.

433
00:16:47,991 --> 00:16:50,960
So it's suffice is to keep you alive.

434
00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:53,810
But there's way less of
that there that you think.

435
00:16:54,530 --> 00:16:59,270
Now what I see in high resolution,

436
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:04,510
so what I using my valuable neurological
resources for is what I decided is

437
00:17:05,121 --> 00:17:05,954
important.

438
00:17:06,170 --> 00:17:10,040
And you can tell what I
decide is important by the
fact that I knew looking at

439
00:17:10,041 --> 00:17:10,550
it,

440
00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:11,030
right?

441
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:13,880
I'm choosing to point by
Isaac something of value.

442
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:18,740
Why else would I call it a point to my
eyes there that the mere fact that I'm

443
00:17:18,741 --> 00:17:23,741
doing that is also an indication that
I organized my perception with a value

444
00:17:24,291 --> 00:17:25,040
structure.

445
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:29,270
And here's something that's really cool
about people is because we want to look

446
00:17:29,271 --> 00:17:30,170
at what's valuable,

447
00:17:30,530 --> 00:17:30,831
right?

448
00:17:30,831 --> 00:17:34,370
That that just seems kind of obvious
why you love what is valuable when you

449
00:17:34,371 --> 00:17:35,750
could look at what's valuable.

450
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:39,080
So how do you ensure what's valuable?

451
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:39,741
Well,

452
00:17:39,741 --> 00:17:42,410
sometimes through painful learning,

453
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:43,670
you learn what's going on,

454
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:44,150
what is it?

455
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:46,310
But with PE,

456
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,210
there's other tricks that we acquired.

457
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:51,080
Figure out what's valuable to Sosa.

458
00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:52,890
Here's something cool about your eyes.

459
00:17:52,891 --> 00:17:53,724
So you know,

460
00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:56,670
you have a pupil and then
you have an iris around that.

461
00:17:56,730 --> 00:17:59,100
It's colorful and you
have whites around that,

462
00:17:59,110 --> 00:17:59,590
right?

463
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:00,770
But you're weird.

464
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:01,411
That rate,

465
00:18:01,411 --> 00:18:04,380
because animals don't have
that even higher priorities.

466
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:07,230
The ones that are most
akin to us biologically,

467
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:08,550
they don't have that.

468
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:09,991
We do.

469
00:18:09,991 --> 00:18:13,830
And the reason for that is I want
to see when you point your eyes,

470
00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:18,240
and if you're Irish to stepping
out on a white background,

471
00:18:18,241 --> 00:18:22,230
I can really tell who your eyes are
pointed and were unbelievably good.

472
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,420
It's figuring out where
people point their eyes.

473
00:18:24,810 --> 00:18:25,311
Exactly.

474
00:18:25,311 --> 00:18:26,970
When we interact with other people,

475
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,860
pretty much all you do
is look at their eyes.

476
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:29,670
Now it is.

477
00:18:29,670 --> 00:18:30,300
Oh yeah.

478
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:34,050
Cause we look at their whole face cause
they're signaling emotions with the face

479
00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:37,200
or returned to figure out what all these
other people that were looking to our

480
00:18:37,201 --> 00:18:38,034
opportunity.

481
00:18:38,370 --> 00:18:39,480
But part of the reason,

482
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:43,110
part of the way that we figured out what
they're up to is by inferring what they

483
00:18:43,111 --> 00:18:44,490
think is valuable.

484
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:48,270
And the way that we infer what they think
is valuable is by watching where they

485
00:18:48,271 --> 00:18:49,300
point thrice.

486
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:50,880
And people are really good at pointing.

487
00:18:50,881 --> 00:18:52,680
Like if I pointed something,

488
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:55,140
which is like an extension of my vision,

489
00:18:55,350 --> 00:18:56,310
if you have any sense,

490
00:18:56,311 --> 00:18:58,380
you don't look at my finger,

491
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:00,810
you look at what I'm pointing out.

492
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:03,180
Now an animal will look
at your finger does.

493
00:19:03,181 --> 00:19:04,890
It just doesn't get the whole,

494
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,390
there's something out there thing,

495
00:19:06,391 --> 00:19:09,780
which is part of the reason [inaudible]
can't speak because the pointing

496
00:19:09,781 --> 00:19:10,351
gestures,

497
00:19:10,351 --> 00:19:15,351
prototypical speech it means signifies
an object of value in often that object

498
00:19:15,381 --> 00:19:15,630
to go,

499
00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:16,800
you would have a name.

500
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:20,370
So we point with our
eyes or things of value.

501
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:22,110
You can track people like this.

502
00:19:22,111 --> 00:19:23,610
So there's a famous site,

503
00:19:23,611 --> 00:19:25,350
social psychological experiments,

504
00:19:25,351 --> 00:19:25,691
kind of,

505
00:19:25,691 --> 00:19:26,200
uh,

506
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:26,700
you know,

507
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:27,780
casual experiment.

508
00:19:28,490 --> 00:19:29,520
So imagine that you're,

509
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:30,240
uh,

510
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,160
you're the experiment.

511
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:35,100
This was done protective to go and all
you do is decided to stand on the corner

512
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:37,500
and look up like this.

513
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:39,270
It's on a busy street.

514
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:40,450
You know,

515
00:19:40,450 --> 00:19:41,880
somebody walks by,

516
00:19:41,970 --> 00:19:45,010
they're kind of thinking that you'll look
at that because there were two vague,

517
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:46,620
you go and you just keep looking up.

518
00:19:47,010 --> 00:19:47,970
May Look at you,

519
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:49,890
they look up and they look at you again.

520
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:51,000
They looked up when they think,

521
00:19:51,001 --> 00:19:51,834
well,

522
00:19:52,050 --> 00:19:53,910
unless there's something wrong with you,

523
00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:55,500
it must be something not that it is.

524
00:19:55,501 --> 00:19:57,250
Why would you be standing
here looking at otherwise?

525
00:19:57,350 --> 00:20:00,240
And so they feel that there must
be something important up there.

526
00:20:00,241 --> 00:20:04,440
And so then they'll look and they'll
look at you to see what's going on.

527
00:20:04,530 --> 00:20:08,040
And then of course there's
two of you located now.

528
00:20:08,090 --> 00:20:10,740
And so we're going to drop there
must really be worth looking at.

529
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:12,990
And so then the next person
will come around and look to it.

530
00:20:12,991 --> 00:20:14,310
So you get a crowd crowded people.

531
00:20:14,370 --> 00:20:17,120
So if you're bored one
day and you're smoking,

532
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:19,550
smoking too much,

533
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:24,551
pause the [inaudible]
experiment about recorder,

534
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:25,890
you know,

535
00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:27,720
so but credit.

536
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:28,770
But there's something,

537
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:32,490
there's something deep about that
too because this is how we infer the

538
00:20:32,491 --> 00:20:33,810
motivation of other people.

539
00:20:33,870 --> 00:20:36,910
This is how we understand that it as we
figure out what the hell they're going

540
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:40,500
to app and that helps us
even further value structure.

541
00:20:40,501 --> 00:20:42,230
And if I can infer your values culture,

542
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,070
if I know what you find is important,

543
00:20:44,370 --> 00:20:47,050
then I can read you as
a simulation online,

544
00:20:47,150 --> 00:20:51,340
biological platform and I can infer
what you're thinking and feeling.

545
00:20:51,341 --> 00:20:52,630
And that's how we understand each other.

546
00:20:52,631 --> 00:20:53,770
That's how it works.

547
00:20:54,010 --> 00:20:58,150
We actually do use avoidance and
computational platform to run this run

548
00:20:58,151 --> 00:21:01,810
simulations of other people and we do
that by ensuring their value structure.

549
00:21:01,810 --> 00:21:02,321
We do that,

550
00:21:02,321 --> 00:21:06,070
but I got to get what they're looking
like trying to go what they're looking at

551
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:08,080
by trying to understand what
they think is important.

552
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:09,940
That's what you do with it moving,

553
00:21:09,970 --> 00:21:10,540
right?

554
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:13,750
You go to a movie like what the hell
are you doing in a movie anyways?

555
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:13,991
Well,

556
00:21:13,991 --> 00:21:15,190
it's entertaining.

557
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:15,970
Well,

558
00:21:15,970 --> 00:21:16,930
that's not the question.

559
00:21:16,931 --> 00:21:19,450
The question is why is it entertaining?

560
00:21:19,870 --> 00:21:23,890
Why is it so important that you
align up at pay to watch it?

561
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:25,120
Like that's,

562
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,490
that's really we're thinking
about because you know,

563
00:21:27,491 --> 00:21:28,570
it's strange behavior.

564
00:21:28,571 --> 00:21:29,020
He fight.

565
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:34,020
It's so useful to you that you
find it intrinsically meaningful.

566
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:35,890
So much so that you'll pay for it.

567
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:36,491
Well,

568
00:21:36,491 --> 00:21:37,181
unless what?

569
00:21:37,181 --> 00:21:38,200
He would just put it your Thomas,

570
00:21:38,201 --> 00:21:42,670
is it just like useless activity or eating
something that board or you're doing

571
00:21:42,671 --> 00:21:43,570
something important.

572
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:44,800
You're going to,

573
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:46,870
to what's essentially a literary,

574
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:48,060
uh,

575
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:52,240
what would you call literary experience
because it's a story and you're locking

576
00:21:52,241 --> 00:21:56,890
yourself on the protagonist and the other
characters and you're adopting their

577
00:21:56,891 --> 00:22:01,891
value structure and you're embodying
that and you experience all the emotions

578
00:22:02,111 --> 00:22:04,260
and all the motivations for no,

579
00:22:04,310 --> 00:22:04,700
no,

580
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:09,700
no risk to yourself except the $14 that
you pay to be admitted to the theater

581
00:22:09,910 --> 00:22:13,020
and you gain all that
experience vicarious.

582
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:16,000
And that's part of how
you understand the world.

583
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:19,120
And we're doing that with each other all
the time when it thinks we're trying to

584
00:22:19,121 --> 00:22:22,390
do is to watch each other and figure
out what support to the other person so

585
00:22:22,391 --> 00:22:26,080
that we can figure out what they're up
to so that we convert what support for us

586
00:22:26,081 --> 00:22:28,600
so we can orient ourselves
property in the world.

587
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:30,100
It's a crucial,

588
00:22:30,101 --> 00:22:31,150
crucial importance.

589
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:33,700
It's partly why stories
are so important to kids.

590
00:22:33,701 --> 00:22:34,480
For example,

591
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,760
you could teach kids over
anything with the story,

592
00:22:36,810 --> 00:22:37,020
you know,

593
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:39,310
will come running up to
you with a book and say,

594
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,151
read me a story.

595
00:22:40,151 --> 00:22:40,930
We'd be a story,

596
00:22:40,930 --> 00:22:44,440
maybe the same story 50 times what
we're trying to understand it.

597
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:46,330
That's how important it is.

598
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:50,170
It's absolutely crucial
and maybe it's crucial.

599
00:22:50,171 --> 00:22:51,004
Some of you can,

600
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:51,310
you know,

601
00:22:51,310 --> 00:22:53,530
you could distinguish
the gorillas from them,

602
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:56,080
from the basketballs
or something like that.

603
00:22:56,110 --> 00:22:56,351
Okay.

604
00:22:56,351 --> 00:23:01,351
So that's another piece of evidence that
we use our value structures to perceive

605
00:23:02,591 --> 00:23:02,981
the world.

606
00:23:02,981 --> 00:23:04,270
So that's took pieces of evidence.

607
00:23:04,271 --> 00:23:06,310
Here's another way of looking at it.

608
00:23:06,311 --> 00:23:07,144
So,

609
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:08,093
um,

610
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:10,270
if I'm looking at this landscape,

611
00:23:10,271 --> 00:23:15,271
let's say on what we see in front of me
is going to depend on what I decide to

612
00:23:16,571 --> 00:23:17,404
do.

613
00:23:17,950 --> 00:23:20,950
So now it's not only what I see and
this is where it gets a little bit more

614
00:23:20,951 --> 00:23:21,910
sophisticated.

615
00:23:21,970 --> 00:23:23,170
It's not only what I see,

616
00:23:23,171 --> 00:23:24,700
it's what I experienced.

617
00:23:24,730 --> 00:23:26,410
It's broader than perception.

618
00:23:26,770 --> 00:23:30,920
And with experience I would say what
motivates me and also what an experience

619
00:23:30,921 --> 00:23:31,754
emotionally.

620
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:34,420
So here's a nice way of
understanding emotions.

621
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:37,690
It's very simple way and have
the relationship with perception.

622
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:43,260
So let's say I need to go over
offstage on that side of the stage.

623
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:46,910
And so if I'm standing here,

624
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:50,990
I have a clear path right to
the other side of the stage.

625
00:23:51,410 --> 00:23:55,820
And that's actually going to have a small
effect on mine because once I decided

626
00:23:55,821 --> 00:24:00,050
that going to the other side of the
stage is the valuable thing to do,

627
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:05,240
when I see a clear path in front of me
that produces a little burst of positive

628
00:24:05,241 --> 00:24:06,074
emotion.

629
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:10,130
And the reason for that is that
people experience caused propulsion in

630
00:24:10,131 --> 00:24:14,000
relationship to the likelihood that
they're going to attain a value goal.

631
00:24:14,150 --> 00:24:16,820
This is also something that's worth
thinking about because you tend to think,

632
00:24:16,821 --> 00:24:17,480
well,

633
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:18,870
you experienced cost promotion.

634
00:24:18,890 --> 00:24:20,570
When you get something you want.

635
00:24:21,110 --> 00:24:21,800
It's like,

636
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:22,940
well,

637
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:24,313
wait a second.

638
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:26,150
It's not so simple.

639
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,073
I mean,

640
00:24:27,110 --> 00:24:30,950
let's say you want to have a promotion
at work and so you get the promotion.

641
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:32,270
Maybe have a party booked out,

642
00:24:32,271 --> 00:24:33,980
but what happens the next day?

643
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:34,751
It's like what?

644
00:24:34,751 --> 00:24:35,600
You're nervous both,

645
00:24:35,601 --> 00:24:35,901
right?

646
00:24:35,901 --> 00:24:37,970
Because you're not going to be word.

647
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,890
Now you have these new responsibilities,

648
00:24:39,950 --> 00:24:42,560
so it sounds like you're
on cloud nine permanently,

649
00:24:42,561 --> 00:24:44,930
or maybe you graduated from high
school and you're happy about that,

650
00:24:44,931 --> 00:24:48,470
but the next day then you've
got a new set of problems.

651
00:24:48,470 --> 00:24:50,510
The same if he graduates
from university here,

652
00:24:50,570 --> 00:24:53,420
whenever you hit a good
milestone in your life,

653
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:56,020
it sounds like you're
there and that's that.

654
00:24:56,170 --> 00:25:00,590
It's so that that that pleasure in the
attainment of a goal could be quite

655
00:25:00,591 --> 00:25:04,400
fleeting because then you need another
goal and even the fact that you need

656
00:25:04,401 --> 00:25:07,080
another goal after hitting
that goal to be a problem.

657
00:25:07,081 --> 00:25:10,070
Like he might be depressed
after graduating from high
school cause you don't

658
00:25:10,071 --> 00:25:11,330
know what to do next.

659
00:25:11,390 --> 00:25:13,130
That happens to people all the time.

660
00:25:13,550 --> 00:25:18,290
So it turns out technically that
the form of positive emotion,

661
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:22,040
positive meaning that's more reliable
than that is the positive emotion that's

662
00:25:22,041 --> 00:25:25,460
associated with the feeling that
you're retaining a valuable goal.

663
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:27,560
How that's worth thinking about too.

664
00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:31,400
Because what it means is that if you
want to the meaning of life that's

665
00:25:31,401 --> 00:25:33,380
positively engaging,

666
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:36,220
then you have to be
pursuing the valuable goal.

667
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:37,161
And so,

668
00:25:37,161 --> 00:25:39,770
and then we can tie that back to
the discussion at the beginning.

669
00:25:39,771 --> 00:25:41,200
It's like what?

670
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:45,380
The way the world manifests
itself to you depends on your aim.

671
00:25:46,070 --> 00:25:46,371
Okay.

672
00:25:46,371 --> 00:25:49,010
And then if you're going to
experience positive emotions world,

673
00:25:49,011 --> 00:25:50,810
you have to have a valuable aid.

674
00:25:50,870 --> 00:25:51,880
And then there was a criminal,

675
00:25:51,881 --> 00:25:52,750
they reach about June,

676
00:25:52,751 --> 00:25:55,430
which is the more valuable your rating,

677
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:57,920
the more positive emotional experience.

678
00:25:57,921 --> 00:25:59,300
While you're moving towards it.

679
00:25:59,510 --> 00:26:00,680
And so with that would imply,

680
00:26:00,681 --> 00:26:01,341
at least in part,

681
00:26:01,341 --> 00:26:02,630
is you want to have the most valuable,

682
00:26:02,631 --> 00:26:03,650
the impossible.

683
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:05,930
That's what it seems to me.

684
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:06,920
So then the question is,

685
00:26:06,921 --> 00:26:07,191
well,

686
00:26:07,191 --> 00:26:08,510
what's the most valuable?

687
00:26:08,511 --> 00:26:09,670
A possible case.

688
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:10,790
So that's where we'll go next.

689
00:26:10,791 --> 00:26:11,210
But,

690
00:26:11,210 --> 00:26:11,841
but anyways,

691
00:26:11,841 --> 00:26:13,250
one of the consequences of that,

692
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:18,260
even in the small and the microcosm that
say is that if you see a clear pathway

693
00:26:18,261 --> 00:26:19,610
to a partial goal,

694
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:21,530
that gives you that boost
of positive emotion.

695
00:26:21,530 --> 00:26:22,430
Now pause.

696
00:26:22,431 --> 00:26:26,060
Depostion is also associated
with the act of moving forward.

697
00:26:26,630 --> 00:26:29,170
So that's how your emotions
are tied to your voice.

698
00:26:29,171 --> 00:26:30,410
So if you,

699
00:26:30,411 --> 00:26:35,150
if you're pursuing something of value
and you have positive emotion that you

700
00:26:35,151 --> 00:26:35,990
have to pursue it,

701
00:26:35,991 --> 00:26:37,090
you're moving ahead and you know,

702
00:26:37,250 --> 00:26:40,730
that's what you're saying when someone
says how you're doing and moving ahead in

703
00:26:40,731 --> 00:26:41,990
life is that,

704
00:26:41,991 --> 00:26:43,410
that's a positive thing to say,

705
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:43,830
right?

706
00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:44,730
I'm kidding your hair.

707
00:26:44,731 --> 00:26:45,030
Yeah,

708
00:26:45,030 --> 00:26:45,380
that's a,

709
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:47,070
that's a positive thing as well.

710
00:26:47,130 --> 00:26:48,510
It's like climbing up a hill.

711
00:26:48,511 --> 00:26:50,310
That's a positive thing as well.

712
00:26:50,730 --> 00:26:55,730
So we know that approaching something
moving forward is associated with positive

713
00:26:56,410 --> 00:26:57,980
emotion stopping.

714
00:26:58,020 --> 00:27:01,650
It's like that's what happens when
something happens that you don't expect.

715
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:06,050
So you're moving head towards a goal and
something you don't expect conference

716
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:07,920
or a threat to something dangerous.

717
00:27:07,921 --> 00:27:09,660
You start that same anxiety.

718
00:27:10,110 --> 00:27:11,220
Technically speaking,

719
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:16,400
anxiety stops because you get anxious
when you don't know what's going on.

720
00:27:17,070 --> 00:27:17,851
You get anxious.

721
00:27:17,851 --> 00:27:18,661
What you don't know.

722
00:27:18,661 --> 00:27:20,370
If the path in front of you is clear,

723
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:23,370
they want and you should stop because
you don't know what's going to happen.

724
00:27:23,670 --> 00:27:24,360
So that's,

725
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:25,193
and then,

726
00:27:25,470 --> 00:27:26,580
and then to retreat,

727
00:27:26,581 --> 00:27:30,030
that's associated say
with escaping from pain.

728
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:34,180
So you basically have three
modes of B move ahead.

729
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:34,730
It's pause.

730
00:27:34,730 --> 00:27:38,330
If you stop and you get
over there and that's,

731
00:27:38,610 --> 00:27:39,810
that's your whole and structure.

732
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:43,840
And so if you see a pathway
in front of you as clear,

733
00:27:43,841 --> 00:27:44,840
it just something you valued,

734
00:27:44,841 --> 00:27:47,920
they're not pushing the
positive emotion and your staff,

735
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,620
he moved forward forthright and they,

736
00:27:49,621 --> 00:27:49,791
now,

737
00:27:49,791 --> 00:27:51,480
if I'm standing here,

738
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:55,980
essentially it's just a little
more complicated because
there are things in the

739
00:27:55,981 --> 00:27:56,940
way,

740
00:27:58,010 --> 00:28:00,860
and that's actually in
some sense how I see them.

741
00:28:01,470 --> 00:28:04,470
Obviously that's a chair
and that's a little stool.

742
00:28:04,530 --> 00:28:05,101
And you might say,

743
00:28:05,101 --> 00:28:05,251
well,

744
00:28:05,251 --> 00:28:06,600
that's what those things are.

745
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:07,380
It's like,

746
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:07,900
yeah,

747
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:08,850
he's not so simple.

748
00:28:08,851 --> 00:28:10,200
Exactly what they are.

749
00:28:10,201 --> 00:28:10,981
For me right now,

750
00:28:10,981 --> 00:28:12,960
there's minor legal obstacles.

751
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:16,020
It in the pathway to my goal.

752
00:28:16,110 --> 00:28:18,600
And so they're dinged with a
little bit of negative emotion.

753
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:18,930
Now,

754
00:28:18,930 --> 00:28:21,480
not too much because I
know I can just do this,

755
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:22,560
right?

756
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:27,090
So I could solve the problem that those
obstacles constituted so they don't

757
00:28:27,091 --> 00:28:27,930
bother me very much.

758
00:28:28,170 --> 00:28:32,040
One of the things that are being suggested
to people is that it's become a bit

759
00:28:32,041 --> 00:28:36,330
of a need is that you should clean up
your room and that's caught on like what

760
00:28:36,331 --> 00:28:36,721
the hell?

761
00:28:36,721 --> 00:28:41,721
Why did that catch what everyone has
told you about since you were like one?

762
00:28:43,410 --> 00:28:44,610
So it's a funny thing,

763
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:45,260
but,

764
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:45,700
but,

765
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:47,160
but there's deep reasons for it.

766
00:28:47,161 --> 00:28:47,994
It's like

767
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:50,280
your room.

768
00:28:50,550 --> 00:28:51,660
Let's say you're in your room,

769
00:28:51,690 --> 00:28:52,320
I dunno.

770
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:52,810
We'll see.

771
00:28:52,810 --> 00:28:56,460
Are Your two hours a day just for the
sake of arguments and so that we can do a

772
00:28:56,461 --> 00:28:58,500
little math there that says stupid mouth.

773
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:00,510
So that's 14 hours a week.

774
00:29:00,511 --> 00:29:01,320
So that's,

775
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:02,250
that's one.

776
00:29:03,330 --> 00:29:04,163
That's one day.

777
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,400
That's what they need in your life.

778
00:29:05,401 --> 00:29:10,401
Footsie or wait for doing something
that is mandatory 14 hours a day.

779
00:29:11,621 --> 00:29:13,500
So it's one seventh of your life.

780
00:29:13,501 --> 00:29:14,990
And so in a,

781
00:29:15,050 --> 00:29:15,661
in a year,

782
00:29:15,661 --> 00:29:17,100
that would be a what?

783
00:29:17,101 --> 00:29:19,080
40 50 days,

784
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:19,980
two months.

785
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:22,620
You're in your own for
two months every year.

786
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:24,390
So that's one seventh of your life.

787
00:29:24,690 --> 00:29:26,340
And so it's all free to your room.

788
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,650
It's really one seventh of your life,

789
00:29:29,550 --> 00:29:29,820
right?

790
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:31,590
You can think about it
as a material place,

791
00:29:31,591 --> 00:29:32,450
that human habit,

792
00:29:32,730 --> 00:29:33,361
it is that.

793
00:29:33,361 --> 00:29:34,920
But that's not all it is.

794
00:29:34,950 --> 00:29:39,420
It's a place that your experience is
localized for one seventh of your life.

795
00:29:39,421 --> 00:29:39,961
And you might think,

796
00:29:39,961 --> 00:29:40,560
well,

797
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:42,360
how you want that experience delayed.

798
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:43,480
So folks like,

799
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:43,781
well,

800
00:29:43,781 --> 00:29:47,480
I didn't want the place to be
like an unruly hellhole so,

801
00:29:47,510 --> 00:29:50,050
so imagine that you have
you things to do in there,

802
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:50,913
right?

803
00:29:51,250 --> 00:29:54,700
You have things to do in their
work to maybe of thinking to do.

804
00:29:54,701 --> 00:29:57,910
Maybe you have to get dressed so you
can present yourself to the world.

805
00:29:57,940 --> 00:29:59,170
They get off to sleep.

806
00:29:59,230 --> 00:29:59,621
I don't know.

807
00:29:59,621 --> 00:30:00,200
Whatever it is.

808
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:01,150
If you're doing in your room,

809
00:30:01,151 --> 00:30:04,090
maybe playing on your computer
to communicate with people.

810
00:30:04,150 --> 00:30:06,220
Let's assume some of that is useful.

811
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:09,630
You know so well how do
you want to organize that?

812
00:30:10,450 --> 00:30:14,770
And answer is you want to organize it
beautifully and efficiently because if you

813
00:30:14,771 --> 00:30:18,340
do that and a good proportion of the
one seventh of your life that you're

814
00:30:18,341 --> 00:30:19,050
spending in there,

815
00:30:19,050 --> 00:30:20,500
there's going to be a bipolar.

816
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:22,630
And so if you organize that room,

817
00:30:22,631 --> 00:30:25,210
at least it make it clean,

818
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:27,840
let's say that's the
minimum starting place,

819
00:30:27,910 --> 00:30:28,600
make it clean.

820
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:31,970
Then the pathway to all those
things that you have to deal with,

821
00:30:31,990 --> 00:30:35,050
that room that are
important becomes clear.

822
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:37,930
And then when you walk into the room
you're going to feel positive emotions,

823
00:30:37,931 --> 00:30:39,100
that negative emotion,

824
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:40,770
you know this perfectly well,

825
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:42,080
you know you don't perfectly well.

826
00:30:42,081 --> 00:30:42,970
I walked into your room,

827
00:30:42,971 --> 00:30:47,680
there's your desk and there's a bunch of
things until their stacks of paper and

828
00:30:47,681 --> 00:30:50,560
you haven't booked out with for like
three months and some of them are like

829
00:30:50,561 --> 00:30:50,951
cats,

830
00:30:50,951 --> 00:30:51,430
bills,

831
00:30:51,430 --> 00:30:52,220
phone bills,

832
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:52,931
correspondence.

833
00:30:52,931 --> 00:30:53,980
You haven't caught up with it.

834
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:55,510
God only knows what.

835
00:30:55,511 --> 00:30:58,130
And some of those bills are
like older than they should be.

836
00:30:58,310 --> 00:31:00,460
You think those were
just stacks of papers?

837
00:31:00,490 --> 00:31:02,470
Of course they're not there.

838
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:05,970
They're not stacks of paper at all
except for the most trivial sets.

839
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:09,700
You're still annoyed with yourself and
so terrified of them and when you walk

840
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:10,121
into your room,

841
00:31:10,121 --> 00:31:11,170
do you want me to book them?

842
00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:11,651
Right?

843
00:31:11,651 --> 00:31:12,401
You'll still,

844
00:31:12,401 --> 00:31:17,170
you'll make a concerted effort not
to look at your desk and if you,

845
00:31:17,171 --> 00:31:19,450
if your room gets cluttered
enough and if you get,

846
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:22,870
if your light's gets cluttered and outs
and everything around you will be like

847
00:31:22,871 --> 00:31:23,620
that.

848
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:28,620
It's all cabled up pathways to hell
essentially distributed randomly Greeley

849
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:30,641
Rehab.

850
00:31:30,641 --> 00:31:31,261
We really,

851
00:31:31,261 --> 00:31:35,470
that serious hope is distributing sort
of randomly through your house and then

852
00:31:35,471 --> 00:31:36,170
tower quarterly.

853
00:31:36,170 --> 00:31:38,830
You're going to have reasonable,

854
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:39,530
productive,

855
00:31:39,530 --> 00:31:40,241
meaningful,

856
00:31:40,241 --> 00:31:44,050
beautiful experience if that's
how you set up your environment.

857
00:31:44,051 --> 00:31:45,610
It's not your requirements,

858
00:31:45,670 --> 00:31:47,410
it's an extension of you.

859
00:31:47,910 --> 00:31:51,850
It's it can't think of it
any more clearly than that.

860
00:31:52,210 --> 00:31:56,570
So with a behavioral psychologists
know perfectly well what going to take.

861
00:31:56,610 --> 00:31:57,071
You could do.

862
00:31:57,071 --> 00:31:59,800
If you want to get people to start
organizing themselves mentally,

863
00:31:59,801 --> 00:32:02,760
he's to do something
like organize their desk,

864
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:03,100
right?

865
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:03,371
I mean,

866
00:32:03,371 --> 00:32:06,940
I know some of you have idiosyncratically
cluttered desks and you know where

867
00:32:06,941 --> 00:32:11,400
everything is and that's your weird
little style and maybe that works for you

868
00:32:11,401 --> 00:32:11,660
all know,

869
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:14,700
probably mostly instructional
aid station Bas,

870
00:32:14,870 --> 00:32:15,703
but

871
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:19,421
you know,

872
00:32:19,421 --> 00:32:19,631
yeah,

873
00:32:19,631 --> 00:32:20,201
that's just,

874
00:32:20,201 --> 00:32:21,440
that's just the way I do it.

875
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:21,821
It's like,

876
00:32:21,821 --> 00:32:22,654
yeah,

877
00:32:24,770 --> 00:32:25,603
but you know,

878
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:28,810
if you take a take a
shot at organizing that,

879
00:32:28,930 --> 00:32:33,010
making them pathways clear and things
clear up the front of you and the

880
00:32:33,011 --> 00:32:36,400
probability that when you walk into
your room it's going to welcome.

881
00:32:36,401 --> 00:32:36,910
You think,

882
00:32:36,910 --> 00:32:37,001
well,

883
00:32:37,001 --> 00:32:37,771
that's weird.

884
00:32:37,771 --> 00:32:37,931
Wait,

885
00:32:37,931 --> 00:32:38,651
you're looking at it,

886
00:32:38,651 --> 00:32:40,070
the group create welcome you.

887
00:32:40,071 --> 00:32:40,904
It's like,

888
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:41,751
really?

889
00:32:41,751 --> 00:32:44,680
You've never been in a room
that's Bosco t it's just has,

890
00:32:44,681 --> 00:32:46,130
you're not paying any attention.

891
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:50,900
I'm sure there's any theme in this
auditory who don't like certain rooms in

892
00:32:50,901 --> 00:32:51,410
their house,

893
00:32:51,410 --> 00:32:55,280
don't like going into them because
God only knows what's in there.

894
00:32:55,610 --> 00:32:58,910
You know when you could feel
that emanating from those places.

895
00:32:58,911 --> 00:33:03,890
Where do you store the hundred and 50,000
decisions that you should've made your

896
00:33:03,891 --> 00:33:08,300
life that you didn't make in the forums
have stacks of things that you should

897
00:33:08,301 --> 00:33:10,070
have attended two years ago.

898
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:13,400
If you don't think that it has any effect
on you and you've just dealt with your

899
00:33:13,401 --> 00:33:17,750
senses to the point where you don't
notice because certainly has an effect on

900
00:33:17,751 --> 00:33:19,400
you and you might also think,

901
00:33:19,401 --> 00:33:22,670
well maybe you what we
want to clean up your room,

902
00:33:22,671 --> 00:33:26,390
which is something you know
you want to make it beautiful,

903
00:33:26,430 --> 00:33:29,600
how it means something even greater and
something I didn't write your voting

904
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:31,340
quotables life in product.

905
00:33:31,341 --> 00:33:32,400
We'd be in the next book.

906
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:34,490
It's like you could take
it to the next step.

907
00:33:34,491 --> 00:33:39,320
You could normally set up your room so
that you knew where your clothes were and

908
00:33:39,321 --> 00:33:44,240
you knew why you were aware and you knew
who you were going to be when you more

909
00:33:44,450 --> 00:33:47,630
and you set up the place that you slate
so that when you went to sleep you

910
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:48,171
slept.

911
00:33:48,171 --> 00:33:49,940
So that B when you will
come to the morning,

912
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,150
like you were refreshed and
ready to take on the world.

913
00:33:53,270 --> 00:33:56,930
So the whole place was pristine and it
reflected your discipline and then you

914
00:33:56,931 --> 00:34:00,680
could make the bloody place beautiful
because you would learn how to do that.

915
00:34:00,770 --> 00:34:01,640
You might take boats,

916
00:34:01,641 --> 00:34:02,790
just my room.

917
00:34:02,791 --> 00:34:04,700
It's like you're a wealthy man.

918
00:34:04,701 --> 00:34:05,770
It hasn't been very long.

919
00:34:05,771 --> 00:34:09,200
So it hasn't been very long at all in
the history of the world that people have

920
00:34:09,201 --> 00:34:10,430
their own room.

921
00:34:10,490 --> 00:34:12,230
It's a bloody miracle that you have that.

922
00:34:12,231 --> 00:34:14,660
And especially with the
kind of rooms we have now,

923
00:34:14,870 --> 00:34:15,691
and that's the case.

924
00:34:15,691 --> 00:34:16,610
Even if you live in,

925
00:34:16,930 --> 00:34:17,211
you know,

926
00:34:17,211 --> 00:34:18,150
maybe the most talk,

927
00:34:18,151 --> 00:34:19,930
the most desirable part of town,

928
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:23,410
you could still make that middle area
that you're responsible for something

929
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:25,610
bloody pristine and perfect.

930
00:34:26,210 --> 00:34:29,210
And that would teach you how to make a
little corner of the world pristine and

931
00:34:29,211 --> 00:34:31,460
perfect and that would
help you be that way.

932
00:34:31,461 --> 00:34:33,230
And then you being that way,

933
00:34:33,231 --> 00:34:36,260
he be rude being that way
with the ahead to your family.

934
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:38,390
Or they might have checked
what nab and he'd say,

935
00:34:38,391 --> 00:34:38,620
grow,

936
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:39,980
wake her up to it.

937
00:34:40,490 --> 00:34:40,851
So,

938
00:34:40,851 --> 00:34:44,780
and then maybe from there you can start
to branch that out into the other things

939
00:34:44,781 --> 00:34:47,670
that you're doing because these
are not trivial issues there.

940
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:48,201
They're very,

941
00:34:48,201 --> 00:34:49,580
very fundamental issues.

942
00:34:49,660 --> 00:34:51,620
So to want to make your,

943
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:56,600
make your room that you would have
the vast majority of the time into a

944
00:34:56,601 --> 00:34:59,630
microcosm of the way that
you would like things to be.

945
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:02,690
It's an unbelievably useful exercise.

946
00:35:02,930 --> 00:35:06,590
What's so cool about it is you can just
do it to practice right there in front

947
00:35:06,591 --> 00:35:06,741
of you.

948
00:35:06,741 --> 00:35:11,741
There's absolutely nothing stopping you
except your contempt for what you have.

949
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:14,470
And that's something you should
just dispense with entirely.

950
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:16,400
Because what's not helpful?

951
00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:17,810
It's not helpful.

952
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:18,890
It's not accurate.

953
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:19,731
It's not helpful.

954
00:35:19,731 --> 00:35:21,470
It's not psychologically useful.

955
00:35:21,471 --> 00:35:22,190
It's,

956
00:35:22,190 --> 00:35:23,570
it's counterproductive.

957
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:24,950
It's not good.

958
00:35:25,010 --> 00:35:25,370
It's not.

959
00:35:25,370 --> 00:35:26,203
We'll

960
00:35:27,770 --> 00:35:28,790
only so,

961
00:35:29,180 --> 00:35:30,380
so now let's,

962
00:35:30,381 --> 00:35:30,741
let's,

963
00:35:30,741 --> 00:35:32,480
let's go into this a bit more deeply.

964
00:35:32,481 --> 00:35:33,300
So,

965
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:33,920
um,

966
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:37,380
one of the things I do with my students
when I'm feeling like torturing is

967
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:39,550
asking why,

968
00:35:39,570 --> 00:35:40,403
why,

969
00:35:40,470 --> 00:35:41,303
why they're,

970
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:42,540
why they're in class.

971
00:35:42,541 --> 00:35:42,961
For example,

972
00:35:42,961 --> 00:35:44,260
say you're trying to do an assignment,

973
00:35:44,730 --> 00:35:45,001
say,

974
00:35:45,001 --> 00:35:45,834
well,

975
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:48,053
why do you care?

976
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:49,133
You do.

977
00:35:50,010 --> 00:35:54,210
Usually you can get about five ounces
of people with this line of questioning

978
00:35:54,211 --> 00:35:57,750
before they run out of answers and
then they're not happy that you keep

979
00:35:57,751 --> 00:35:59,180
questioning it because it's rude.

980
00:35:59,181 --> 00:36:01,240
It's like when you care
about the assignment,

981
00:36:01,241 --> 00:36:01,801
it's like,

982
00:36:01,801 --> 00:36:02,634
well,

983
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:06,780
I need to hand in the assignment
to get a good grade in the course.

984
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,520
Why do you care about what they not?

985
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:09,920
You get a good grade in the course.

986
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:10,231
Well,

987
00:36:10,231 --> 00:36:11,064
I need to,

988
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:14,250
I need to finish off this year universe.

989
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:15,330
Oh,

990
00:36:15,330 --> 00:36:16,680
I need to do that.

991
00:36:16,710 --> 00:36:17,131
Well,

992
00:36:17,131 --> 00:36:20,580
I need to graduate and
and and have a degree.

993
00:36:21,390 --> 00:36:21,651
Well,

994
00:36:21,651 --> 00:36:22,780
why do you need to be fast?

995
00:36:22,790 --> 00:36:23,221
And it's like,

996
00:36:23,221 --> 00:36:23,461
well,

997
00:36:23,461 --> 00:36:24,420
because I need to,

998
00:36:24,450 --> 00:36:27,030
I need to get a job and support myself.

999
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:27,893
Well,

1000
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:29,670
you get the basic idea.

1001
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:32,190
Why do you need to do that as well?

1002
00:36:32,191 --> 00:36:34,160
I want to have a career.

1003
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:35,480
Maybe I want to have a family.

1004
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:36,120
It's like,

1005
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:36,391
okay,

1006
00:36:36,391 --> 00:36:39,800
well why do you need to do that if
you keep asking that question now,

1007
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:41,100
now what?

1008
00:36:41,101 --> 00:36:44,730
I'm what I'm pointing out
here is something that's
sort of analogous to what I

1009
00:36:44,731 --> 00:36:46,720
was pointing out when I was unblinded.

1010
00:36:46,730 --> 00:36:49,860
Why you went to the lab to begin
with and follow the instructions,

1011
00:36:49,861 --> 00:36:50,041
right?

1012
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:53,340
There's a whole bunch of reasons that
are determining your behave and so when

1013
00:36:53,341 --> 00:36:56,730
you do something like maybe you're going
to a library and so we have to cross

1014
00:36:56,731 --> 00:36:57,660
the street.

1015
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:59,320
If cross the street to the library,

1016
00:36:59,321 --> 00:37:01,540
when you have to get to the library to
pick up a book and you have to pick up a

1017
00:37:01,541 --> 00:37:03,950
book to study and you need
to study to pass the exam.

1018
00:37:03,970 --> 00:37:07,620
Then that nests inside all of those
other plans that I just described.

1019
00:37:07,621 --> 00:37:10,680
So normally do you have a need,

1020
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:11,603
let's say,

1021
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:15,570
but you have a name that's nested inside
of a bunch of other readers and so

1022
00:37:15,571 --> 00:37:20,571
that's how you focus your attention on
the world is I need to cross the street

1023
00:37:20,970 --> 00:37:23,670
because I need to go to the library
because I needed to get a book because I

1024
00:37:23,671 --> 00:37:27,300
need to study because I need to pass the
exam because I need to pass the course

1025
00:37:27,301 --> 00:37:30,420
because I need to get the degree so it's
like get a job so that I could take my

1026
00:37:30,421 --> 00:37:32,160
place in the community and what you,

1027
00:37:32,170 --> 00:37:34,980
what you notice is that with
each of those questions,

1028
00:37:35,610 --> 00:37:40,590
the area that you're eating
covers in terms of timing space,

1029
00:37:40,620 --> 00:37:42,870
that's the right way of
thinking about gets bigger,

1030
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:43,470
right?

1031
00:37:43,470 --> 00:37:46,410
Because crossing the street that's like
the five second thing and going to the

1032
00:37:46,411 --> 00:37:47,830
library to get a bulk rate.

1033
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:52,100
That's like a one hour thing and then
study a one week they your cortices,

1034
00:37:52,110 --> 00:37:56,880
a one month thing or three months they
are with each of those successive moves

1035
00:37:56,881 --> 00:38:01,881
out where outward you're describing a
series of agents that cover a larger area

1036
00:38:03,301 --> 00:38:04,860
of space and time.

1037
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:08,010
So you can think about that as
your map of the space and time.

1038
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:12,460
And that's a useful map because you live
in space and time and so you should map

1039
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:16,770
and that's what you do with your value
structure because all of that's value,

1040
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:17,371
right?

1041
00:38:17,371 --> 00:38:21,060
It's all assumption about what
it is that's necessary to do.

1042
00:38:21,570 --> 00:38:22,680
So then the question is,

1043
00:38:22,681 --> 00:38:25,680
well what is it necessary to do?

1044
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:29,010
How far out can you push that step up?

1045
00:38:29,011 --> 00:38:29,711
Assumptions.

1046
00:38:29,711 --> 00:38:30,031
It's like,

1047
00:38:30,031 --> 00:38:35,031
well it's kind of pushed it out to well
I want to be a productive person who a

1048
00:38:35,670 --> 00:38:40,670
and I want to have a family
take [inaudible] well
maybe people stopped there

1049
00:38:41,121 --> 00:38:43,130
because they think at south,

1050
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:44,620
but it's something like that.

1051
00:38:44,620 --> 00:38:46,570
It collapses into self evidence.

1052
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:47,930
So it's rude bullshit.

1053
00:38:48,270 --> 00:38:48,551
It's like,

1054
00:38:48,551 --> 00:38:49,810
well it does.

1055
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:50,630
It does.

1056
00:38:50,630 --> 00:38:51,041
Like what?

1057
00:38:51,041 --> 00:38:51,791
Cause you might ask,

1058
00:38:51,791 --> 00:38:52,240
well,

1059
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:52,601
okay,

1060
00:38:52,601 --> 00:38:54,370
let's say you're going to
have a career and a family.

1061
00:38:54,940 --> 00:38:55,690
Um,

1062
00:38:55,690 --> 00:38:59,660
is there a map in which
that should be embedded?

1063
00:39:00,060 --> 00:39:01,030
And then the question would be,

1064
00:39:01,031 --> 00:39:01,181
one,

1065
00:39:01,181 --> 00:39:03,190
if you're going to have
a career to a family,

1066
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:07,570
how should you go about doing
that in the best possible way?

1067
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:09,970
Because I would be the next question.

1068
00:39:10,250 --> 00:39:13,090
At some point you're going to
run out of ability to question.

1069
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:16,300
You're going to hit hit the
ultimate ends of the map.

1070
00:39:16,301 --> 00:39:20,860
I would say what seems to happen as far
as I can tell is that when you get out

1071
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:23,170
that far in the line
of ethical questioning,

1072
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:24,630
you start pictured that domain.

1073
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:28,570
It's something like the story because
if you don't have an explicit answer

1074
00:39:28,571 --> 00:39:29,050
anymore,

1075
00:39:29,050 --> 00:39:29,291
just say,

1076
00:39:29,291 --> 00:39:32,650
well I'm going to have a family
and I couldn't have a career.

1077
00:39:32,650 --> 00:39:33,011
It was like,

1078
00:39:33,011 --> 00:39:35,320
well why are you going to do that?

1079
00:39:35,750 --> 00:39:37,240
Why is that an important thing to do?

1080
00:39:37,241 --> 00:39:39,340
Or how would you do that
if you did it right?

1081
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:40,930
And then when you do what,

1082
00:39:40,931 --> 00:39:43,930
at some point when you run
out of explicit answers,

1083
00:39:43,931 --> 00:39:45,550
you start thinking about examples.

1084
00:39:45,551 --> 00:39:46,121
And you might think,

1085
00:39:46,121 --> 00:39:48,020
well that's where people
have already always done it.

1086
00:39:48,220 --> 00:39:50,470
That's when people I admire hooked up.

1087
00:39:50,471 --> 00:39:50,650
No,

1088
00:39:50,650 --> 00:39:51,370
that's what,

1089
00:39:51,370 --> 00:39:52,400
that's what my father did.

1090
00:39:52,470 --> 00:39:54,010
That was what my grandfather did.

1091
00:39:54,250 --> 00:39:54,970
Or I knew,

1092
00:39:54,970 --> 00:39:57,790
I knew people who took real
pride in their work and that's,

1093
00:39:57,850 --> 00:39:59,320
and that's how I want to conduct myself.

1094
00:39:59,321 --> 00:40:01,300
So you start to devolve,

1095
00:40:01,570 --> 00:40:04,870
what would you say your explicit
precept position started to shout into

1096
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:06,460
something like stories.

1097
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:11,680
And so that's where our explicit knowledge
meets the domain of the great story.

1098
00:40:13,030 --> 00:40:15,070
So what's the great story?

1099
00:40:15,130 --> 00:40:16,460
What's all that nested it?

1100
00:40:16,690 --> 00:40:21,220
This is where the discussion gets
more complicated and this is where,

1101
00:40:21,950 --> 00:40:24,220
this is where it would have
to dig to get this right.

1102
00:40:26,770 --> 00:40:27,500
Okay.

1103
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:32,500
Have you tried to understand what it
means to act ethically and all that?

1104
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:37,520
Starting with the presupposition that
that actually does mean something?

1105
00:40:37,940 --> 00:40:38,900
So you know,

1106
00:40:38,950 --> 00:40:40,550
in our modern world,

1107
00:40:40,610 --> 00:40:43,040
people tend towards a
kind of moral relativism.

1108
00:40:43,370 --> 00:40:45,080
They make the proposition
that there's many,

1109
00:40:45,081 --> 00:40:48,940
many ethical systems and it's very
difficult to adjudicate between them.

1110
00:40:48,941 --> 00:40:52,610
And maybe there's no ethical system that
has predominance over any other ethical

1111
00:40:52,611 --> 00:40:53,041
system.

1112
00:40:53,041 --> 00:40:53,960
Something like that.

1113
00:40:54,020 --> 00:40:55,310
But I don't buy that.

1114
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:56,840
I don't think it's true at all.

1115
00:40:56,841 --> 00:41:00,950
I think that there's very limited number
of ways that you could make your way

1116
00:41:00,951 --> 00:41:02,510
through the world properly,

1117
00:41:03,020 --> 00:41:04,990
and that that's severely constraints.

1118
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,160
The value system that you have to a dog,

1119
00:41:07,220 --> 00:41:07,611
let's say.

1120
00:41:07,611 --> 00:41:08,240
Well,

1121
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:09,290
if you want to,

1122
00:41:10,290 --> 00:41:10,420
do,

1123
00:41:10,420 --> 00:41:11,300
you want to be,

1124
00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:16,550
if you want to be a family and
you want to do that properly,

1125
00:41:17,030 --> 00:41:17,863
let's say,

1126
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:21,560
then how might you go about doing that?

1127
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:22,790
Well,

1128
00:41:22,790 --> 00:41:23,623
let's see if we can,

1129
00:41:23,750 --> 00:41:25,420
we can take that apart and look a bit.

1130
00:41:25,780 --> 00:41:26,613
Uh,

1131
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:30,070
I can use this as a,

1132
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:31,113
as a means of,

1133
00:41:31,810 --> 00:41:32,720
as a means of,

1134
00:41:33,810 --> 00:41:34,643
of examples.

1135
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:36,673
Okay.

1136
00:41:37,050 --> 00:41:38,630
You want to be a good father.

1137
00:41:39,970 --> 00:41:44,970
And so then imagine that one of the things
for the good father does is teach his

1138
00:41:45,231 --> 00:41:48,410
children how to behave properly.

1139
00:41:48,590 --> 00:41:50,440
So that's rule number five in my book,

1140
00:41:50,450 --> 00:41:50,631
right?

1141
00:41:50,631 --> 00:41:53,970
Don't let your children do anything
that makes you dislike them.

1142
00:41:54,410 --> 00:41:58,790
So I'm going to give you a sophisticated
example about how you might teach your

1143
00:41:58,791 --> 00:42:00,380
children to behave properly.

1144
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:04,700
And that would be part of the structure
in which being a good parent would be

1145
00:42:04,701 --> 00:42:05,534
nested.

1146
00:42:05,660 --> 00:42:05,931
Okay.

1147
00:42:05,931 --> 00:42:10,530
So I'll tell you a little
story about hockey game.

1148
00:42:10,540 --> 00:42:13,580
I've watched once was a
cocky gate that my kid,

1149
00:42:13,610 --> 00:42:14,960
something was involved in it.

1150
00:42:15,110 --> 00:42:17,990
He was a pretty decent talked there
and he was on the book 13 when this was

1151
00:42:17,991 --> 00:42:18,800
happening.

1152
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:23,660
But he used to go watch him play at least
those neighborhood lead and here's a

1153
00:42:23,661 --> 00:42:24,320
good hockey player.

1154
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:26,060
But he wasn't the best
talking to bear and his team.

1155
00:42:26,061 --> 00:42:30,170
There's this other kid that was clearly
at the start and we were watching this,

1156
00:42:30,390 --> 00:42:32,880
the championship game and uh,

1157
00:42:33,270 --> 00:42:33,620
you know,

1158
00:42:33,620 --> 00:42:37,930
it was well if foc game
between well-matched dinged.

1159
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:38,870
So that's a good thing.

1160
00:42:38,871 --> 00:42:39,201
Right?

1161
00:42:39,201 --> 00:42:41,690
Generally if you want
to watch a sports game,

1162
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:42,570
weirdly enough,

1163
00:42:42,571 --> 00:42:46,880
do you want to see a well 14
between well-matched teams.

1164
00:42:46,910 --> 00:42:50,120
You don't want to see one team just
stomp the hell out of the other,

1165
00:42:50,150 --> 00:42:50,983
you know,

1166
00:42:51,020 --> 00:42:55,280
and have the game be 18 to
one it's not that sox fine.

1167
00:42:55,310 --> 00:42:57,200
Do you want to see the struggle?

1168
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:59,990
I'm full and it been
relatively matched manner.

1169
00:43:00,020 --> 00:43:03,200
It's kind of interesting because it's
not obvious why you would want to see,

1170
00:43:03,260 --> 00:43:03,471
you know,

1171
00:43:03,471 --> 00:43:04,400
one team just,

1172
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:05,210
you know,

1173
00:43:05,210 --> 00:43:06,080
beat to death,

1174
00:43:06,081 --> 00:43:07,670
so to speak by either,

1175
00:43:07,700 --> 00:43:09,680
maybe you could take some
gratification in that,

1176
00:43:09,681 --> 00:43:11,390
but if you have any sense you don't,

1177
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:13,910
you want to see the team
struggle against each other.

1178
00:43:13,970 --> 00:43:15,350
You want the outcome to be,

1179
00:43:15,620 --> 00:43:20,480
to be too hard enough so
that it's uncertain and you
want to see the spectacle

1180
00:43:20,490 --> 00:43:21,590
unfold in real time.

1181
00:43:21,591 --> 00:43:22,670
And so that's what was happening.

1182
00:43:22,671 --> 00:43:23,900
So it was really good game.

1183
00:43:24,170 --> 00:43:25,490
And then in the last six,

1184
00:43:25,491 --> 00:43:26,960
seven seconds of the game,

1185
00:43:27,020 --> 00:43:29,090
real cliffhanger or something like that,

1186
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:29,350
uh,

1187
00:43:29,350 --> 00:43:32,520
about six or seven seconds on
the kids from the opposing team.

1188
00:43:32,521 --> 00:43:35,610
Zicam ice can't beautiful
place or oppose goes the rent.

1189
00:43:35,611 --> 00:43:37,580
And that was the end of the
game and everybody cloud.

1190
00:43:37,581 --> 00:43:38,091
But you know,

1191
00:43:38,091 --> 00:43:39,890
the kids lined up and
shook each other's hands.

1192
00:43:40,100 --> 00:43:42,500
But the star on my son's team,

1193
00:43:42,590 --> 00:43:43,460
he was knocked out,

1194
00:43:44,220 --> 00:43:45,550
he was not happy.

1195
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:46,280
He,

1196
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:49,910
he was acting out the proposition
that he had been wrong.

1197
00:43:49,970 --> 00:43:53,320
And so he got off the ice and he took
his hockey stick and he smashed it up.

1198
00:43:53,321 --> 00:43:56,620
The spent them a little
tantrum and old and uh,

1199
00:43:56,660 --> 00:43:58,190
which was pretty pathetic.

1200
00:43:58,820 --> 00:43:59,560
His father,

1201
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:00,241
seriously.

1202
00:44:00,241 --> 00:44:00,650
That's like,

1203
00:44:00,650 --> 00:44:01,490
what the hell?

1204
00:44:01,700 --> 00:44:06,170
And so then as far as father came rushing
up and his father was a preposterous

1205
00:44:06,180 --> 00:44:07,013
idea

1206
00:44:08,940 --> 00:44:11,390
and he basically agreed with this sub.

1207
00:44:11,391 --> 00:44:11,661
He said,

1208
00:44:11,661 --> 00:44:11,991
yeah,

1209
00:44:11,991 --> 00:44:12,141
yeah,

1210
00:44:12,141 --> 00:44:12,931
you were abroad.

1211
00:44:12,931 --> 00:44:14,690
Did you played such as protection again,

1212
00:44:14,691 --> 00:44:17,720
you should one the referees took
it away from you and you know,

1213
00:44:17,810 --> 00:44:21,320
he was just some misbehaved
like two year old.

1214
00:44:21,350 --> 00:44:24,080
And then he rewarded
for it and reinforced.

1215
00:44:24,140 --> 00:44:24,810
It's like,

1216
00:44:24,810 --> 00:44:24,951
well,

1217
00:44:24,951 --> 00:44:29,951
one of the things that we
could hypothesize is that's
not a good way to be a

1218
00:44:30,201 --> 00:44:35,201
good to be good parents for that matter
is that in some manner he was damaging

1219
00:44:35,551 --> 00:44:38,130
his son and so,

1220
00:44:38,170 --> 00:44:39,900
and he paid for it.

1221
00:44:39,901 --> 00:44:41,920
It's like I didn't know
the guy a bad dude.

1222
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:46,020
I watched how he conducted himself of the
chickens eventually came home to roost

1223
00:44:46,050 --> 00:44:47,370
as they inevitably do.

1224
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:48,360
And so,

1225
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:49,191
you know,

1226
00:44:49,191 --> 00:44:51,240
and so we'll keeps put
what was the problem here?

1227
00:44:51,270 --> 00:44:51,871
Exactly.

1228
00:44:51,871 --> 00:44:52,010
It's,

1229
00:44:52,010 --> 00:44:53,580
it's not so easy to take apart.

1230
00:44:53,581 --> 00:44:55,290
So think about his son was,

1231
00:44:55,291 --> 00:44:57,150
he was the best player on the team.

1232
00:44:57,750 --> 00:44:58,501
So I mean,

1233
00:44:58,501 --> 00:45:01,320
he's trying to win the game because
that's what you're supposed to do is

1234
00:45:01,321 --> 00:45:01,621
trigger.

1235
00:45:01,621 --> 00:45:02,454
But again,

1236
00:45:02,790 --> 00:45:04,450
if you're the best hockey
player in the teapot,

1237
00:45:04,470 --> 00:45:05,940
that's a kind of victory,

1238
00:45:06,150 --> 00:45:06,840
right?

1239
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:07,950
And if you're trying to win,

1240
00:45:07,951 --> 00:45:09,150
well that's what you should be doing.

1241
00:45:09,151 --> 00:45:09,760
And if you don't,

1242
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:10,380
we have it.

1243
00:45:10,380 --> 00:45:12,270
Why not be upset about it?

1244
00:45:12,870 --> 00:45:13,531
Because after all,

1245
00:45:13,531 --> 00:45:14,970
what you're trying to do is win.

1246
00:45:15,540 --> 00:45:16,320
And so,

1247
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:17,040
but,

1248
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:18,180
but you know all of them.

1249
00:45:18,181 --> 00:45:18,550
No,

1250
00:45:18,550 --> 00:45:19,890
we've know what your weaker moments,

1251
00:45:19,891 --> 00:45:22,020
you might act like that kid's father,

1252
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:22,500
you know,

1253
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:24,480
you know that that's not good.

1254
00:45:24,540 --> 00:45:25,590
So why,

1255
00:45:25,890 --> 00:45:26,520
why,

1256
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:27,960
what exactly is going on?

1257
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:29,940
And you might say to your kid,

1258
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:30,781
well,

1259
00:45:30,781 --> 00:45:33,300
it doesn't matter whether you
win or lose your kindness over,

1260
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:34,260
played the game.

1261
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:36,240
And your kid thinks,

1262
00:45:37,740 --> 00:45:39,060
what do you mean by that?

1263
00:45:40,170 --> 00:45:41,003
And you say,

1264
00:45:41,610 --> 00:45:41,851
well,

1265
00:45:41,851 --> 00:45:42,730
I don't know,

1266
00:45:46,360 --> 00:45:48,150
but it's the right way to behave.

1267
00:45:49,350 --> 00:45:49,891
And it's like,

1268
00:45:49,891 --> 00:45:50,101
yeah,

1269
00:45:50,101 --> 00:45:50,671
you don't know,

1270
00:45:50,671 --> 00:45:52,200
but it is the right way to behave.

1271
00:45:52,740 --> 00:45:55,770
And so I can tell you why it's
the right way to behave and think.

1272
00:45:56,490 --> 00:45:59,030
And so it just goes along
with just chapter five.

1273
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:01,860
But that your children do anything
that makes you just like so,

1274
00:46:02,180 --> 00:46:03,360
so imagine this.

1275
00:46:03,540 --> 00:46:08,010
So what is it exactly that you're trying
to do when you want your kid to win?

1276
00:46:08,930 --> 00:46:09,571
That's first of all,

1277
00:46:09,571 --> 00:46:13,190
you got to think about what do you
need by when we were in decided to do,

1278
00:46:13,191 --> 00:46:14,780
you don't need stomp your entity,

1279
00:46:14,781 --> 00:46:19,230
a team to nothing on in the hockey arena
because there's something about that.

1280
00:46:19,260 --> 00:46:21,030
It's just not exactly right.

1281
00:46:21,210 --> 00:46:21,541
Okay.

1282
00:46:21,541 --> 00:46:22,374
So,

1283
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:22,900
uh,

1284
00:46:22,900 --> 00:46:25,080
what do you mean give me win this game?

1285
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:26,581
Well,

1286
00:46:26,581 --> 00:46:26,821
no,

1287
00:46:26,821 --> 00:46:31,200
you don't exactly mean that
because life is APP game,

1288
00:46:32,250 --> 00:46:33,083
right?

1289
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:38,240
It's a sequence of kings and probably
that it's a secrets of different games,

1290
00:46:39,120 --> 00:46:39,301
right?

1291
00:46:39,301 --> 00:46:41,370
And realizing that you're going
to be a pro hockey player,

1292
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:42,570
just you're not,

1293
00:46:42,571 --> 00:46:44,850
so you might as well just
give up go hat cause it's,

1294
00:46:44,910 --> 00:46:45,150
you know,

1295
00:46:45,150 --> 00:46:46,200
it's just not going to happen.

1296
00:46:46,201 --> 00:46:47,700
But even if it does happen,

1297
00:46:47,701 --> 00:46:49,530
it's still a sequence of games.

1298
00:46:49,531 --> 00:46:50,490
It's not one thing.

1299
00:46:50,500 --> 00:46:51,620
It's a sequence of change.

1300
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:53,670
But if you're a typical person,

1301
00:46:53,730 --> 00:46:55,560
and even if you're a pro hockey player,

1302
00:46:55,800 --> 00:47:00,330
hockey is just one of the many games you
come into play and you're going to play

1303
00:47:00,331 --> 00:47:03,780
those games with the same people
often over and over and over and over.

1304
00:47:04,050 --> 00:47:05,010
And so then you might say,

1305
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:10,040
well the rules that govern the probability
that you'll win a set of games isn't

1306
00:47:12,541 --> 00:47:17,460
the same as the rule that governs whether
or not you would one of you should

1307
00:47:17,461 --> 00:47:22,461
never compromise your ability to prevail
in a set of games for the purpose of

1308
00:47:25,171 --> 00:47:26,610
winning a single game.

1309
00:47:27,210 --> 00:47:30,640
And so when you tell a kid
should be a good sport,

1310
00:47:30,710 --> 00:47:31,543
Kevin,

1311
00:47:31,810 --> 00:47:32,790
what you're saying is

1312
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:38,020
that was the game has a sequel
haven has some important,

1313
00:47:38,080 --> 00:47:41,170
it's up to you to try and win cause you
don't find the playbooks as he tried to

1314
00:47:41,171 --> 00:47:41,620
win.

1315
00:47:41,620 --> 00:47:46,620
But this case is only part of a much
bigger thing and you're not trying to win

1316
00:47:47,740 --> 00:47:51,220
in this at the cost of
the much bigger thing.

1317
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:53,020
That would be foolish.

1318
00:47:53,250 --> 00:47:57,640
And so what you actually want to do is
conduct yourself in the game in a variety

1319
00:47:57,641 --> 00:48:01,270
of ways that maximizes the
value of the whole set.

1320
00:48:01,271 --> 00:48:01,781
So you might say,

1321
00:48:01,781 --> 00:48:06,781
well let's say you're on a team
passed the damn pot now and then why?

1322
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:07,121
Well,

1323
00:48:07,121 --> 00:48:11,410
cause you thought teammates and maybe
your whole team would be better to help

1324
00:48:11,411 --> 00:48:12,580
develop them.

1325
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:13,221
So,

1326
00:48:13,221 --> 00:48:15,040
and maybe you could be the star,

1327
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:17,050
you should try to be the
best player on the team,

1328
00:48:17,051 --> 00:48:19,420
but at the same time she did
it the whole team better.

1329
00:48:19,420 --> 00:48:20,350
So you know,

1330
00:48:20,351 --> 00:48:25,120
spend 30% of your time passing
the damn park to 700 kid.

1331
00:48:25,510 --> 00:48:25,811
So,

1332
00:48:25,811 --> 00:48:26,470
and then,

1333
00:48:26,470 --> 00:48:27,010
well,

1334
00:48:27,010 --> 00:48:27,370
you know,

1335
00:48:27,370 --> 00:48:31,840
that's also gonna show the other kids
that year or someone who's worthy of,

1336
00:48:31,940 --> 00:48:32,620
of,

1337
00:48:32,620 --> 00:48:34,420
of being on the team.

1338
00:48:34,421 --> 00:48:37,840
That's a really important thing because
you're going to be on the load of teams

1339
00:48:37,841 --> 00:48:40,150
and then as well,

1340
00:48:40,900 --> 00:48:44,430
if you conduct yourself properly while
you're playing the game and people

1341
00:48:44,450 --> 00:48:45,010
observe them,

1342
00:48:45,010 --> 00:48:47,740
then they're going to invite you
to play a bunch of other games.

1343
00:48:47,830 --> 00:48:49,840
And that's really what we
want for your kids at school.

1344
00:48:49,841 --> 00:48:50,140
Right?

1345
00:48:50,140 --> 00:48:50,973
If you think about it,

1346
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:54,520
you don't want them to
be the best at a game.

1347
00:48:54,550 --> 00:48:58,810
You want the probability that people
will invite them throughout their life to

1348
00:48:58,811 --> 00:49:03,670
play in a whole series of interesting
games to be absolutely maximized because

1349
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:08,440
then they'd never lacked opportunity that
think the whole world opens itself up

1350
00:49:08,441 --> 00:49:08,680
to them.

1351
00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:13,680
It's so what you're saying when you
say it doesn't have a human or lose it

1352
00:49:13,851 --> 00:49:18,370
matters how you played the game is conduct
yourself so that you have the highest

1353
00:49:18,371 --> 00:49:20,350
probability of preventative cross,

1354
00:49:20,351 --> 00:49:22,330
the whitest possible set of gauge.

1355
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:26,290
And there's an ethic there and
there's a real ethic there.

1356
00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:31,350
It's real because it is really the
case that life is a set of games,

1357
00:49:31,420 --> 00:49:31,541
uh,

1358
00:49:31,541 --> 00:49:32,660
a very large set of the cage.

1359
00:49:32,661 --> 00:49:36,820
And it really is the case that there's
a way of playing a set of gauge that

1360
00:49:36,821 --> 00:49:41,230
maximizes the probability that you'll
be successful at the largest number of

1361
00:49:41,231 --> 00:49:42,064
games.

1362
00:49:42,120 --> 00:49:42,970
And it's very,

1363
00:49:43,030 --> 00:49:44,950
it's a very sophisticated ethic.

1364
00:49:44,951 --> 00:49:45,520
It's like,

1365
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:47,800
and so I think I can
develop that a little bit.

1366
00:49:47,801 --> 00:49:50,860
It's like now you're trying to figure
out how to conduct yourself in the world

1367
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:53,950
are going back to what's the
outside of the value structure.

1368
00:49:53,950 --> 00:49:55,360
How are you going to be a good parent?

1369
00:49:55,570 --> 00:49:58,210
You're going to teach your kid
how to play properly world.

1370
00:49:58,270 --> 00:50:00,850
You have to know how to play
properly in the world to do that.

1371
00:50:00,851 --> 00:50:02,110
So that's going to go along with it.

1372
00:50:02,111 --> 00:50:02,944
It's like,

1373
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:04,690
well I'll,

1374
00:50:04,691 --> 00:50:07,360
how else might that outside,

1375
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:08,313
uh,

1376
00:50:08,530 --> 00:50:09,500
ethical structure,

1377
00:50:09,501 --> 00:50:11,080
the parameterize that say,

1378
00:50:11,110 --> 00:50:16,110
well you want to play the game so that
you take care of yourself because you

1379
00:50:16,421 --> 00:50:19,690
need to take care of herself or someone
else has doing doesn't seem like a great

1380
00:50:19,691 --> 00:50:20,290
deal.

1381
00:50:20,290 --> 00:50:22,660
So you have to take care of
yourself and that's hard.

1382
00:50:22,661 --> 00:50:22,901
You know,

1383
00:50:22,901 --> 00:50:27,070
there's things you need your complicated
thing to propagate across time,

1384
00:50:27,470 --> 00:50:27,771
right?

1385
00:50:27,771 --> 00:50:29,030
So you have to take care of yourself,

1386
00:50:29,031 --> 00:50:32,510
but you have to take care of
yourself in a way that works today.

1387
00:50:33,160 --> 00:50:35,030
It doesn't interfere with tomorrow.

1388
00:50:35,780 --> 00:50:38,510
And so the today and tomorrow
don't interfere with the next week.

1389
00:50:38,510 --> 00:50:39,321
And so today,

1390
00:50:39,321 --> 00:50:43,100
tomorrow and next week don't interfere
with next month and next year.

1391
00:50:43,160 --> 00:50:45,230
Cause you're not just
taking care of yourself,

1392
00:50:45,231 --> 00:50:49,250
you're taking care of the set
of your possible future selves.

1393
00:50:49,310 --> 00:50:52,010
And that's way more
complicated and difficult.

1394
00:50:52,070 --> 00:50:54,730
And so you're parameterizing
what you have to do.

1395
00:50:54,731 --> 00:50:54,900
He,

1396
00:50:54,900 --> 00:50:55,890
there's an ethic Amanda,

1397
00:50:55,920 --> 00:51:00,920
but it's more stringent than map
because no man is an island this,

1398
00:51:01,131 --> 00:51:01,731
they say it.

1399
00:51:01,731 --> 00:51:04,520
So it isn't that you just
have to take care of yourself,

1400
00:51:04,670 --> 00:51:08,810
take care of yourself and your family
and you have to do that in a way so that

1401
00:51:08,811 --> 00:51:10,790
there's no interference
between the two of you.

1402
00:51:10,820 --> 00:51:13,370
And so that it propagates across time.

1403
00:51:13,430 --> 00:51:15,020
So that's really difficult.

1404
00:51:15,080 --> 00:51:18,170
And then you have take care of yourself
and your family in a way that absolutely

1405
00:51:18,171 --> 00:51:19,970
benefits the community.

1406
00:51:20,750 --> 00:51:21,580
And so that,

1407
00:51:21,580 --> 00:51:23,330
that makes it even harder.

1408
00:51:23,870 --> 00:51:27,710
And if there's no reason not to aim it
out because we'd be talking about what it

1409
00:51:27,711 --> 00:51:28,880
is that you should aim at,

1410
00:51:28,910 --> 00:51:29,361
it's like,

1411
00:51:29,361 --> 00:51:33,860
well you might as well aim at that because
there wasn't anything better that you

1412
00:51:33,861 --> 00:51:34,760
put a mat.

1413
00:51:34,940 --> 00:51:36,890
And we already decided
that piece to some degree,

1414
00:51:36,891 --> 00:51:40,830
that the way the world manifests
itself to you is dependent on what you,

1415
00:51:40,831 --> 00:51:44,000
a map and then you should aim
at the best possible vein.

1416
00:51:44,060 --> 00:51:47,330
And so now we're trying to figure
out what the best possible thing is.

1417
00:51:47,390 --> 00:51:48,780
There's a hypothesis there too,

1418
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:53,800
which is the more you're willing
to aim at the best possible fame,

1419
00:51:54,440 --> 00:51:57,860
the better the world that
reveals itself to you is,

1420
00:51:58,370 --> 00:51:58,731
and you know,

1421
00:51:58,731 --> 00:51:59,001
you,

1422
00:51:59,001 --> 00:51:59,900
you kind of one of that,

1423
00:51:59,930 --> 00:52:01,760
I think you kind of know that already.

1424
00:52:01,850 --> 00:52:04,640
I would say part of the reason
you know that implicitly,

1425
00:52:04,760 --> 00:52:07,610
you know that in the same way
that you admire someone who's,

1426
00:52:07,670 --> 00:52:09,230
who's a good sport,

1427
00:52:09,860 --> 00:52:10,490
because you are,

1428
00:52:10,490 --> 00:52:12,170
that even if you watch pro,

1429
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:13,310
if you watch pro sports,

1430
00:52:13,311 --> 00:52:15,260
of course inspiring people with skills,

1431
00:52:15,320 --> 00:52:18,080
there's no doubt about that and you
should because they're supposed to develop

1432
00:52:18,081 --> 00:52:18,914
their skills.

1433
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:21,870
But the athlete who's top form and who's,

1434
00:52:21,871 --> 00:52:22,130
uh,

1435
00:52:22,130 --> 00:52:22,341
who's,

1436
00:52:22,341 --> 00:52:22,730
uh,

1437
00:52:22,730 --> 00:52:23,061
who's,

1438
00:52:23,061 --> 00:52:23,600
uh,

1439
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:24,320
what would you say?

1440
00:52:24,320 --> 00:52:25,700
Who's a mature,

1441
00:52:25,701 --> 00:52:30,320
an honorable player that goes to the
people that shine above everyone else.

1442
00:52:30,321 --> 00:52:31,080
They have the skill,

1443
00:52:31,080 --> 00:52:34,720
but they have the nobility of character
and you put those two things together

1444
00:52:34,721 --> 00:52:35,061
and you think,

1445
00:52:35,061 --> 00:52:35,894
well there's an APP.

1446
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:39,410
There was a role model
for young people as well,

1447
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:41,370
so it's not just that
they could play the game,

1448
00:52:41,390 --> 00:52:42,050
suffer badly.

1449
00:52:42,050 --> 00:52:46,520
Although the candidates that they blame
the set of getting suffered and you

1450
00:52:46,521 --> 00:52:46,671
know,

1451
00:52:46,671 --> 00:52:51,671
you see that an athlete too who have
a real well real stellar reputation,

1452
00:52:52,041 --> 00:52:56,200
let's say stellar like a star because
that infers to starve course to start with

1453
00:52:56,201 --> 00:53:00,860
something that you have to lift up
your eyes above the earth to see it,

1454
00:53:00,861 --> 00:53:01,251
to look.

1455
00:53:01,251 --> 00:53:05,390
I want it to have it into a transcendent
space into something that twinkles in

1456
00:53:05,391 --> 00:53:09,800
the dark with the source of light to all
of that managed is part of what you use

1457
00:53:09,801 --> 00:53:14,210
when you describe someone as a star
and it's because you know placidly that

1458
00:53:14,211 --> 00:53:15,530
they're acting off his ethic.

1459
00:53:15,530 --> 00:53:18,410
That's part and parcel hopes
at the world's straight.

1460
00:53:19,190 --> 00:53:21,650
So soul.

1461
00:53:21,890 --> 00:53:23,180
That's quite remarkable.

1462
00:53:23,240 --> 00:53:24,050
That's all equipment.

1463
00:53:24,050 --> 00:53:26,170
I think this is like me.

1464
00:53:26,610 --> 00:53:30,240
It's all standards at least to some
degree out of the gorilla experiment,

1465
00:53:30,750 --> 00:53:31,100
right?

1466
00:53:31,100 --> 00:53:31,933
It's like,

1467
00:53:32,370 --> 00:53:34,270
why is it that you saw what you saw?

1468
00:53:34,310 --> 00:53:35,580
It depends on what you mean now.

1469
00:53:36,030 --> 00:53:36,331
It's like,

1470
00:53:36,331 --> 00:53:37,164
okay,

1471
00:53:37,230 --> 00:53:41,070
now that we've started figuring out
that what we see and what we emotionally

1472
00:53:41,071 --> 00:53:43,470
experiences associated
with what we aim at,

1473
00:53:43,471 --> 00:53:46,920
that we can start figuring out
just exactly what we should email.

1474
00:53:47,060 --> 00:53:51,240
And so here's the kind of thought
and I think it's a worthwhile one.

1475
00:53:51,241 --> 00:53:52,110
We'll do two things.

1476
00:53:52,111 --> 00:53:53,670
Well before this fight,

1477
00:53:57,130 --> 00:53:59,370
I didn't talk about how you
can get your aim street.

1478
00:54:01,590 --> 00:54:02,423
Here's disappears.

1479
00:54:03,370 --> 00:54:07,660
So I thought a lot about
the idea of meaning in life.

1480
00:54:08,020 --> 00:54:08,710
I wrote,

1481
00:54:08,710 --> 00:54:10,720
the first book I wrote was
called maps of meaning.

1482
00:54:10,721 --> 00:54:11,291
Exactly.

1483
00:54:11,291 --> 00:54:14,410
There was an attempt to
lay out the structure,

1484
00:54:14,470 --> 00:54:17,170
meaning as soon as that
such a thing existed,

1485
00:54:17,460 --> 00:54:18,293
um,

1486
00:54:18,550 --> 00:54:21,810
I derived some propositions as a
consequences of writing that book.

1487
00:54:22,360 --> 00:54:22,990
Um,

1488
00:54:22,990 --> 00:54:24,190
it's a very serious book.

1489
00:54:24,680 --> 00:54:26,340
It's all in audio form now.

1490
00:54:26,440 --> 00:54:28,780
Casey Richards did it came
out about three days ago.

1491
00:54:28,850 --> 00:54:30,240
So it's a hard book,

1492
00:54:30,241 --> 00:54:32,930
but I think it's a lot
easier to understand it.

1493
00:54:32,950 --> 00:54:37,950
It's spoken form because I could adequate
proper intonations to the complex

1494
00:54:38,891 --> 00:54:41,050
sentences and Abimelech due to the,

1495
00:54:41,110 --> 00:54:45,370
to the right and so if you like 12 rules
for life and if you're interested in

1496
00:54:45,371 --> 00:54:47,080
what I'm talking about tonight,

1497
00:54:47,620 --> 00:54:49,180
then you can give it a shot.

1498
00:54:49,390 --> 00:54:50,830
It's about 50 hours long.

1499
00:54:50,831 --> 00:54:53,140
I think that anything
in the spoken for form,

1500
00:54:53,530 --> 00:54:54,670
so it's very demanding.

1501
00:54:55,360 --> 00:54:57,730
It'll take you places that
are very much worth going.

1502
00:54:58,060 --> 00:54:58,893
Seriously,

1503
00:54:59,230 --> 00:54:59,840
please.

1504
00:54:59,840 --> 00:55:00,390
They,

1505
00:55:00,390 --> 00:55:03,790
they picked very much what's
going on as far as I'm concerned.

1506
00:55:04,090 --> 00:55:07,530
I'd be basing the lectures that I'd be
doing it for 30 years on that book and

1507
00:55:07,990 --> 00:55:11,570
the people that I brought along on the
journey that constitutes the lecture and

1508
00:55:11,571 --> 00:55:13,720
seek to think that it's
worthwhile as well.

1509
00:55:13,870 --> 00:55:15,940
So you could give it a
shot and it's a study.

1510
00:55:16,380 --> 00:55:17,890
It's a study of the meeting.

1511
00:55:17,950 --> 00:55:20,190
There's a set of
propositions in bedded in it.

1512
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:27,700
One of the propositions is that
life is intrinsically and erratic,

1513
00:55:27,701 --> 00:55:29,320
deeply meaningful,

1514
00:55:29,350 --> 00:55:32,830
but the ineradicable meaning is negative.

1515
00:55:33,330 --> 00:55:36,670
Like the suffering people
are limited it mortal.

1516
00:55:36,700 --> 00:55:38,560
We all die like this.

1517
00:55:38,590 --> 00:55:43,300
Like let's go to a tragic element
that there's no arguing your cell of,

1518
00:55:43,690 --> 00:55:48,690
and so when people say is life meaningful
that it's what they need because the

1519
00:55:48,761 --> 00:55:52,750
negative part of life is right there and
you're going to experience it whether

1520
00:55:52,751 --> 00:55:53,960
you believe it or not,

1521
00:55:53,970 --> 00:55:56,020
when you're stepping
into a meeting or not,

1522
00:55:56,040 --> 00:55:59,890
that's nothing to do with whether or
not you're going to suffer pain and be

1523
00:55:59,891 --> 00:56:00,850
anxious.

1524
00:56:01,070 --> 00:56:06,070
That's going to happen regardless of
your rationalizations and so you're stuck

1525
00:56:06,731 --> 00:56:11,731
with that and you could consider that
some sense of a fundamental reality.

1526
00:56:11,970 --> 00:56:16,970
And I would say most transcendent
religious systems make exactly that claim.

1527
00:56:18,580 --> 00:56:23,050
So Judaism of course concentrates
on the trash the past.

1528
00:56:23,250 --> 00:56:27,940
Now I'm going to say he says all these
religious systems concentrate on one of

1529
00:56:27,941 --> 00:56:30,670
the first noble truth of Buddhism
is that life is suffering.

1530
00:56:30,671 --> 00:56:34,120
And then of course there's Christianity
and you are all familiar with the

1531
00:56:34,121 --> 00:56:37,510
central symbolic figure in Christianity,

1532
00:56:37,511 --> 00:56:38,860
which is the crucifix,

1533
00:56:38,861 --> 00:56:42,010
which is if that is the
representation of suffering,

1534
00:56:42,040 --> 00:56:46,360
then then you're not paying attention
to the religion because that's obviously

1535
00:56:46,361 --> 00:56:47,140
what it is.

1536
00:56:47,140 --> 00:56:47,621
In fact,

1537
00:56:47,621 --> 00:56:52,090
it's the worst time of suffering because
here's the worst time of suffering.

1538
00:56:52,250 --> 00:56:53,320
He saw her physically,

1539
00:56:53,330 --> 00:56:54,160
mentally,

1540
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:54,940
right,

1541
00:56:54,940 --> 00:56:59,200
but the reason you suffer
is because people be traded
you and they'd be training

1542
00:56:59,201 --> 00:57:01,410
despite the fact that you're in this.

1543
00:57:02,280 --> 00:57:05,350
So it probably is it suffering
is the worst suffering,

1544
00:57:05,620 --> 00:57:07,420
which makes it
architectural in some sense.

1545
00:57:07,421 --> 00:57:10,330
It makes it a kind of suffering
that can't be exceeded.

1546
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:12,580
So that that's why that simple has such,

1547
00:57:12,581 --> 00:57:15,760
it's one of many reasons that
that symbol has such power.

1548
00:57:15,850 --> 00:57:16,061
It's like,

1549
00:57:16,061 --> 00:57:16,361
okay,

1550
00:57:16,361 --> 00:57:17,650
so that's the bottle of wine.

1551
00:57:17,651 --> 00:57:20,560
That's the baseline structure of reality.

1552
00:57:20,561 --> 00:57:21,394
Let's say.

1553
00:57:21,490 --> 00:57:21,880
God,

1554
00:57:21,880 --> 00:57:23,470
that's so pessimistic.

1555
00:57:23,471 --> 00:57:24,070
It's like,

1556
00:57:24,070 --> 00:57:24,431
yeah,

1557
00:57:24,431 --> 00:57:25,264
that's for sure.

1558
00:57:25,450 --> 00:57:27,160
But what is it is,

1559
00:57:27,161 --> 00:57:28,720
it's unbelievable to be pessimistic,

1560
00:57:28,721 --> 00:57:29,300
but,

1561
00:57:29,300 --> 00:57:34,300
but the thing is is that you can't get
to what you need to get to until you get

1562
00:57:35,171 --> 00:57:36,910
to what you can barely tolerate.

1563
00:57:37,390 --> 00:57:38,680
That's a good way of thinking about it.

1564
00:57:38,681 --> 00:57:39,520
And you all know,

1565
00:57:39,521 --> 00:57:43,330
and I think part of the reasons perhaps
that you're here is because I'd be

1566
00:57:43,331 --> 00:57:45,910
talking about these sorts of
things in my lectures and my books,

1567
00:57:45,911 --> 00:57:50,510
and I'm not trying to pull any punches
like I do believe that everyone knows

1568
00:57:50,790 --> 00:57:53,590
that the claim that life is suffering,

1569
00:57:53,800 --> 00:57:57,640
and then it's tainted by malevolence by
the way in which even makes it worse,

1570
00:57:57,641 --> 00:57:58,210
right?

1571
00:57:58,210 --> 00:57:59,260
It's not just suffering.

1572
00:57:59,261 --> 00:58:01,480
It's not just the fact
that life is tragic,

1573
00:58:01,580 --> 00:58:03,100
that's bad enough,

1574
00:58:03,160 --> 00:58:06,040
but it's made worse by the fact
that no matter how bad things are,

1575
00:58:06,041 --> 00:58:08,470
or you can do something
stupid to make them worse,

1576
00:58:08,530 --> 00:58:13,530
and he probably not only will it have
you all know that because you know,

1577
00:58:13,950 --> 00:58:16,180
you know perfectly well
that when you're miserable,

1578
00:58:16,690 --> 00:58:16,961
I mean,

1579
00:58:16,961 --> 00:58:20,860
I know terrible things could just sort
of happen randomly and I understand that

1580
00:58:20,861 --> 00:58:21,730
perfectly well,

1581
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:25,340
but you also know that many of the
most miserable moments in your life,

1582
00:58:25,360 --> 00:58:26,890
no doubt there is many of them.

1583
00:58:27,210 --> 00:58:30,190
You are accompanied by this sense that
you knew bloody well when you were

1584
00:58:30,191 --> 00:58:30,791
getting into it.

1585
00:58:30,791 --> 00:58:32,320
You weren't smart enough to stop it.

1586
00:58:32,380 --> 00:58:37,380
Or maybe you even facilitated or maybe
facilitated knowing that suffering was

1587
00:58:37,511 --> 00:58:37,841
going to be,

1588
00:58:37,841 --> 00:58:38,650
they'll come and say,

1589
00:58:38,650 --> 00:58:39,401
well to hell with it,

1590
00:58:39,401 --> 00:58:40,690
I'm going to do it anyways.

1591
00:58:40,870 --> 00:58:41,620
And so,

1592
00:58:41,620 --> 00:58:42,191
and you know,

1593
00:58:42,191 --> 00:58:45,800
or maybe it'd be betrayed by someone
cause that happens very often and maybe

1594
00:58:45,801 --> 00:58:47,110
you'd be traded some honor.

1595
00:58:47,170 --> 00:58:51,400
You aren't deceitfully or immorally by
your own moral standards by the way.

1596
00:58:51,480 --> 00:58:54,310
And so nothing so bad that
you can't make it worse.

1597
00:58:54,670 --> 00:58:55,001
Right?

1598
00:58:55,001 --> 00:58:59,470
And so it's not just that life is tragic
and it's also touched with malevolence

1599
00:58:59,471 --> 00:59:01,180
and that definitely makes it work.

1600
00:59:01,181 --> 00:59:01,380
So,

1601
00:59:01,380 --> 00:59:02,860
so that's your starting point.

1602
00:59:03,220 --> 00:59:03,491
It's like,

1603
00:59:03,491 --> 00:59:03,851
okay,

1604
00:59:03,851 --> 00:59:04,461
so that's about,

1605
00:59:04,461 --> 00:59:06,220
I'm as pessimistic as it gets.

1606
00:59:06,280 --> 00:59:06,641
And you know,

1607
00:59:06,641 --> 00:59:08,740
you do read dealt into
that you can look at,

1608
00:59:08,980 --> 00:59:13,980
I studied totalitarian brutality for
40 years I guess in Hawaii and I was

1609
00:59:15,761 --> 00:59:16,720
clinical psychologists,

1610
00:59:16,721 --> 00:59:16,990
just oil.

1611
00:59:16,990 --> 00:59:17,591
I still am.

1612
00:59:17,591 --> 00:59:20,830
But I've done thousands of hours of
clinical work and I've seen some pretty

1613
00:59:20,840 --> 00:59:24,920
nasty things of course studies and
things that were perhaps even worse.

1614
00:59:24,921 --> 00:59:29,240
And so it is definitely the case that
people can make it the mirror tragedy of

1615
00:59:29,241 --> 00:59:29,691
their life.

1616
00:59:29,691 --> 00:59:32,210
And just something very
much approximating hell.

1617
00:59:32,270 --> 00:59:35,210
Some of you probably from
families have done exactly that.

1618
00:59:35,211 --> 00:59:38,240
Or maybe you're in a family right
now that's doing exactly that.

1619
00:59:38,540 --> 00:59:38,811
It's like,

1620
00:59:38,811 --> 00:59:41,300
so in that step that takes a bad thing.

1621
00:59:41,310 --> 00:59:42,500
It makes it unbearable.

1622
00:59:42,530 --> 00:59:42,801
You know,

1623
00:59:42,801 --> 00:59:46,460
you've been thinking sometimes matching
people around the deathbed that the

1624
00:59:46,461 --> 00:59:47,270
family member,

1625
00:59:47,270 --> 00:59:47,481
right?

1626
00:59:47,481 --> 00:59:49,880
And there's all sorts of
unresolved family conflict.

1627
00:59:49,881 --> 00:59:53,630
And so isn't that not that the person's
laying there gasping up their last

1628
00:59:53,631 --> 00:59:54,080
breath,

1629
00:59:54,080 --> 00:59:55,920
but everybody in the room was hostile.

1630
00:59:55,921 --> 00:59:59,600
And let's say they're also arguing because
that's certainly a good time to have

1631
00:59:59,601 --> 01:00:01,160
an argument that it certainly happens.

1632
01:00:01,190 --> 01:00:01,851
Plenty of it.

1633
01:00:01,851 --> 01:00:05,560
So you can take stuff from that's pretty
damn bad and then you could turn it

1634
01:00:05,561 --> 01:00:06,410
into hail.

1635
01:00:07,220 --> 01:00:09,740
And so that's life.

1636
01:00:10,220 --> 01:00:10,641
You think,

1637
01:00:10,641 --> 01:00:12,680
well that's pessimistic.

1638
01:00:12,681 --> 01:00:13,010
It's like,

1639
01:00:13,010 --> 01:00:13,843
yes,

1640
01:00:13,850 --> 01:00:16,270
good means we've got to
the bottom of things.

1641
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:18,950
That's a place that you
could start building and say,

1642
01:00:18,951 --> 01:00:19,784
all right,

1643
01:00:19,910 --> 01:00:20,600
fair enough.

1644
01:00:20,600 --> 01:00:22,790
It's like life could be like that.

1645
01:00:22,860 --> 01:00:26,870
So what that means is that
you need a reason to you.

1646
01:00:26,871 --> 01:00:28,970
You need a reason when things aren't good,

1647
01:00:28,971 --> 01:00:30,630
you need a reason to get
out of bed in the morning.

1648
01:00:30,660 --> 01:00:35,390
You need a reason to move forward
despite the fact that life is essentially

1649
01:00:35,391 --> 01:00:38,810
tragic and it's tainted by
malevolence and the question is,

1650
01:00:38,840 --> 01:00:41,810
is there anything that's up sufficient?

1651
01:00:41,960 --> 01:00:43,970
Grand jury I'd say are sufficient.

1652
01:00:43,971 --> 01:00:48,971
Nobility were sufficient solidity to be
of the 80 to you when you're facing with

1653
01:00:51,021 --> 01:00:56,021
the tragic malevolence of life and I
think the answer to that is yes and that's

1654
01:00:56,991 --> 01:01:01,991
why this isn't pessimistic because if you
could pose the worst possible question

1655
01:01:03,590 --> 01:01:06,650
but then you can answer
it with the proper answer,

1656
01:01:06,710 --> 01:01:08,590
then the question is no longer so bad.

1657
01:01:08,630 --> 01:01:08,961
Carl,

1658
01:01:08,961 --> 01:01:12,260
you said instruct
holiness in for the tour.

1659
01:01:12,440 --> 01:01:13,131
It's a Latin,

1660
01:01:13,131 --> 01:01:17,390
it means that which you most want and
will be followed where you least want to

1661
01:01:17,391 --> 01:01:19,430
look man,

1662
01:01:19,490 --> 01:01:22,890
that's a smart idea and then
actually happens to be wavering.

1663
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:24,950
Look where your where was easy to look.

1664
01:01:24,951 --> 01:01:26,990
Yours is a book where you want it to look.

1665
01:01:27,110 --> 01:01:31,040
It's time to look where you don't want
to look and that's that sweeping for

1666
01:01:31,041 --> 01:01:31,341
sure.

1667
01:01:31,341 --> 01:01:31,701
It's like,

1668
01:01:31,701 --> 01:01:32,240
well,

1669
01:01:32,240 --> 01:01:35,840
we just look where we don't want to
look at this conversation at the darkest

1670
01:01:35,841 --> 01:01:36,531
part of life.

1671
01:01:36,531 --> 01:01:36,891
It's like,

1672
01:01:36,891 --> 01:01:37,724
well,

1673
01:01:38,450 --> 01:01:39,350
are we all do it?

1674
01:01:39,460 --> 01:01:41,780
If that's the fundamental
preconditions of life,

1675
01:01:41,900 --> 01:01:42,980
yes it is.

1676
01:01:43,250 --> 01:01:44,090
Are we up to it?

1677
01:01:44,300 --> 01:01:44,631
Well,

1678
01:01:44,631 --> 01:01:47,900
the answer that seems to be yes,

1679
01:01:47,960 --> 01:01:48,860
as a matter of fact,

1680
01:01:48,861 --> 01:01:51,980
but no matter how difficult life is,

1681
01:01:52,040 --> 01:01:53,940
and no matter how tragic the conditions,

1682
01:01:54,240 --> 01:01:58,700
no matter even the fact that it's made
worse by the malevolence of the human

1683
01:01:58,701 --> 01:02:03,701
spirit that say we're actually capable
of moving forward and prevailing under

1684
01:02:03,771 --> 01:02:05,480
such circumstances with our eyes,

1685
01:02:06,560 --> 01:02:07,100
I would say,

1686
01:02:07,100 --> 01:02:07,700
well,

1687
01:02:07,700 --> 01:02:12,700
the world reveals itself team in
accordance with your aims in the world.

1688
01:02:13,520 --> 01:02:14,300
So I can say,

1689
01:02:14,300 --> 01:02:15,020
well,

1690
01:02:15,020 --> 01:02:18,780
the world has this proclivity to
tilt towards tragedy and malevolence.

1691
01:02:18,940 --> 01:02:20,450
What are you going to
do with all the power?

1692
01:02:21,400 --> 01:02:22,211
You need the name.

1693
01:02:22,211 --> 01:02:27,211
But it's so remarkable that acting towards
it justifies the catastrophe of your

1694
01:02:29,431 --> 01:02:30,330
existence.

1695
01:02:30,810 --> 01:02:31,141
And you know,

1696
01:02:31,141 --> 01:02:32,790
I could put that in pro se form.

1697
01:02:32,791 --> 01:02:34,380
And you all know this is true too.

1698
01:02:34,410 --> 01:02:38,010
You need a reason to get out of bed in
the morning when things aren't good.

1699
01:02:38,280 --> 01:02:39,690
And things are in our thing to be good.

1700
01:02:39,691 --> 01:02:40,381
At some point,

1701
01:02:40,381 --> 01:02:41,010
you know you're,

1702
01:02:41,010 --> 01:02:42,660
there's going to be
illness in your family.

1703
01:02:42,930 --> 01:02:44,970
There's going to be the
collapse of your dreams.

1704
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,940
There's going to be the pathology
of your state is or you're going to,

1705
01:02:47,941 --> 01:02:51,840
you're going to encounter all the
vicissitudes of life now just for sure,

1706
01:02:51,841 --> 01:02:54,240
and if your goal is to be happy,

1707
01:02:54,480 --> 01:02:57,450
well that's not going to get
you through the rough times.

1708
01:02:57,450 --> 01:03:00,960
That's for sure because you're not going
to be happy then and it's precisely

1709
01:03:00,961 --> 01:03:04,530
during the rough times that you need
to get through and maybe you can say to

1710
01:03:04,531 --> 01:03:06,030
yourself something like a,

1711
01:03:06,031 --> 01:03:09,670
look what I'm doing instead
is pursuing a noble.

1712
01:03:09,671 --> 01:03:13,740
The school like the possibly can see
robot going to take care of myself

1713
01:03:13,980 --> 01:03:14,813
properly.

1714
01:03:15,480 --> 01:03:20,480
I'm going to do that in a way if it's a
maybe a maximal benefit to my family and

1715
01:03:21,601 --> 01:03:25,140
aren't going to take care of myself and
my family in a way that it's a valuable

1716
01:03:25,141 --> 01:03:26,700
benefit to my community.

1717
01:03:26,760 --> 01:03:29,290
I'm going to take all those things
into account simultaneously.

1718
01:03:29,300 --> 01:03:32,940
And the reason I'm going to do that
is because I can push back against the

1719
01:03:32,941 --> 01:03:36,270
tragedy of the world and I could
constrain these malevolence.

1720
01:03:36,390 --> 01:03:39,360
I can do that in my own heart and I
can help the people around and do that.

1721
01:03:39,420 --> 01:03:41,970
And you can in fact do that.

1722
01:03:42,080 --> 01:03:43,950
Certainly you could make it worse.

1723
01:03:44,080 --> 01:03:47,670
That's absolutely undeniable and that's
actually a great place to start because

1724
01:03:47,671 --> 01:03:49,440
once you know that you can make it worse.

1725
01:03:49,590 --> 01:03:49,891
You know,

1726
01:03:49,891 --> 01:03:50,281
if these,

1727
01:03:50,281 --> 01:03:53,700
if you could see doing that well Brian,

1728
01:03:53,730 --> 01:03:54,570
well that's something,

1729
01:03:54,571 --> 01:03:55,110
right?

1730
01:03:55,110 --> 01:03:56,640
Even if you're not moving the world,

1731
01:03:56,670 --> 01:03:58,920
you know extraordinarily
rapidly towards Heather do,

1732
01:03:58,921 --> 01:04:02,440
you could move it at least be
somewhat quickly away from hell.

1733
01:04:02,441 --> 01:04:03,290
It gets the hell of it.

1734
01:04:03,300 --> 01:04:05,520
You're capable of producing
and it's not right.

1735
01:04:05,521 --> 01:04:08,880
That's nothing cause you
can cause a lot of trouble.

1736
01:04:08,910 --> 01:04:11,130
You have that firmly within your,

1737
01:04:11,190 --> 01:04:13,380
you have the power to
cause a lot of trouble.

1738
01:04:13,440 --> 01:04:16,980
You know that because you probably already
caused a lot of trouble now and then

1739
01:04:17,250 --> 01:04:19,560
and so you can at least stop doing that.

1740
01:04:19,710 --> 01:04:24,060
You could see that ability by
looking at capacity for destruction,

1741
01:04:24,270 --> 01:04:25,950
you can see what you're capable of.

1742
01:04:26,490 --> 01:04:29,840
And so that should give you some respect
for yourself and kind of a perverse

1743
01:04:29,850 --> 01:04:30,600
manner.

1744
01:04:30,600 --> 01:04:33,960
If you're that much of a
force for catastrophe and
managing what sort of course

1745
01:04:33,961 --> 01:04:35,190
for good you can be,

1746
01:04:35,490 --> 01:04:39,750
you might be enough of a force for good
to stand up as a whole arc against the

1747
01:04:39,751 --> 01:04:40,584
catastrophe.

1748
01:04:40,950 --> 01:04:42,150
And I would say,

1749
01:04:43,410 --> 01:04:44,010
well,

1750
01:04:44,010 --> 01:04:46,650
so all that deep pessimism for me,

1751
01:04:46,680 --> 01:04:51,210
some sense disappears because I
do look to people and I think man,

1752
01:04:51,211 --> 01:04:52,021
we got a rough,

1753
01:04:52,021 --> 01:04:55,650
like there's no doubt about it that this
is available with tears and we could

1754
01:04:55,651 --> 01:04:57,960
twist it into something
that's quite Hellige,

1755
01:04:58,110 --> 01:05:01,650
but there's enough nobility in each of
us so that we can actually work against

1756
01:05:01,651 --> 01:05:02,490
that and we can,

1757
01:05:02,780 --> 01:05:04,290
we can make the world less tragic.

1758
01:05:04,291 --> 01:05:07,290
But he said we can definitely
make it less bilevel in place.

1759
01:05:07,380 --> 01:05:08,640
And we did work on that,

1760
01:05:08,700 --> 01:05:10,800
like right in our local environments,

1761
01:05:10,801 --> 01:05:11,010
right?

1762
01:05:11,010 --> 01:05:12,990
We could make our rooms
clean and beautiful.

1763
01:05:12,991 --> 01:05:13,824
We can make our,

1764
01:05:13,950 --> 01:05:15,180
our family's pristine.

1765
01:05:15,181 --> 01:05:15,750
We can,

1766
01:05:15,750 --> 01:05:16,950
we can get our age,

1767
01:05:16,990 --> 01:05:17,380
we can,

1768
01:05:17,380 --> 01:05:22,120
we can shut our aim and we can live in
their eyes above the horizon aiming for

1769
01:05:22,121 --> 01:05:22,841
what's best.

1770
01:05:22,841 --> 01:05:23,800
We can do that.

1771
01:05:23,860 --> 01:05:26,410
And what's so fascinating
about Catholics say,

1772
01:05:26,470 --> 01:05:30,700
well that immediately infuse your life
with the kind of positive meaning that

1773
01:05:30,701 --> 01:05:31,371
they will sit down,

1774
01:05:31,371 --> 01:05:32,720
actually sustain the tragedy.

1775
01:05:32,830 --> 01:05:35,560
It's like I've done
something worthwhile to do.

1776
01:05:36,030 --> 01:05:36,281
You know,

1777
01:05:36,281 --> 01:05:41,281
nature said he who has
a why can bear any how.

1778
01:05:42,690 --> 01:05:44,550
I was like a brilliant phrase.

1779
01:05:44,800 --> 01:05:45,440
So you know,

1780
01:05:45,440 --> 01:05:47,690
one of the things are
we doing is traveling.

1781
01:05:47,760 --> 01:05:48,401
Come to me now,

1782
01:05:48,401 --> 01:05:48,611
look,

1783
01:05:48,611 --> 01:05:51,880
I am here talking to
people about exactly this,

1784
01:05:51,940 --> 01:05:53,230
talking to the promote them,

1785
01:05:53,290 --> 01:05:55,810
maximizing their responsibility.

1786
01:05:56,130 --> 01:05:59,810
They will because your life is
tragic as authority lay notes.

1787
01:05:59,811 --> 01:06:00,490
It's like,

1788
01:06:00,490 --> 01:06:04,570
and so you need a way or viewing that
with the richest possible meaning so that

1789
01:06:04,571 --> 01:06:07,630
you don't become corrupted and resentful,

1790
01:06:07,690 --> 01:06:12,550
angry and hostile and cruel and worse
as a consequence of the burden that you

1791
01:06:12,551 --> 01:06:14,490
have to bear that's placed upon us.

1792
01:06:14,500 --> 01:06:15,011
But keep it.

1793
01:06:15,011 --> 01:06:17,200
Take that on Roland terror you can take,

1794
01:06:17,201 --> 01:06:17,351
well,

1795
01:06:17,351 --> 01:06:21,280
I wouldn't do absolutely everything I
can to make absolutely everything around

1796
01:06:21,281 --> 01:06:26,281
me as good as I could possibly make and
not some naive virtue signaling way.

1797
01:06:26,950 --> 01:06:27,940
That is what I need.

1798
01:06:27,970 --> 01:06:29,410
I mean to take this on like this,

1799
01:06:29,411 --> 01:06:33,210
the task of your life and it
is the task of let your friend.

1800
01:06:33,550 --> 01:06:34,061
Then you think,

1801
01:06:34,061 --> 01:06:34,690
well,

1802
01:06:34,690 --> 01:06:35,011
what?

1803
01:06:35,011 --> 01:06:39,550
What would that make possible in this
world of art school were remarkable

1804
01:06:39,551 --> 01:06:40,151
creatures.

1805
01:06:40,151 --> 01:06:40,720
You know,

1806
01:06:40,720 --> 01:06:42,330
we're all in a nice appeal.

1807
01:06:42,400 --> 01:06:43,011
We're on a night,

1808
01:06:43,011 --> 01:06:44,470
South Hill trajectory,

1809
01:06:44,480 --> 01:06:45,120
ethical,

1810
01:06:45,120 --> 01:06:45,760
you know,

1811
01:06:45,760 --> 01:06:49,450
things all over the world are
getting better really quite quickly,

1812
01:06:49,480 --> 01:06:50,710
quite remarkably quickly.

1813
01:06:50,711 --> 01:06:51,011
You didn't know.

1814
01:06:51,011 --> 01:06:54,580
This isn't very well known because
of our deep current pessimism.

1815
01:06:54,640 --> 01:06:55,240
You know,

1816
01:06:55,240 --> 01:06:57,240
people are being lifted
out of poverty right now,

1817
01:06:57,241 --> 01:07:00,790
running the world and rape is absolutely
unprecedented in the history of

1818
01:07:00,791 --> 01:07:01,624
mankind.

1819
01:07:01,760 --> 01:07:02,290
Ha.

1820
01:07:02,290 --> 01:07:06,850
We lifted half the people who were in
absolute poverty in the year 2000 we're no

1821
01:07:06,851 --> 01:07:11,150
longer in absolute poverty by the
year 2012 that was more than him.

1822
01:07:11,260 --> 01:07:16,260
[inaudible] 300,000 a thousand

1823
01:07:17,430 --> 01:07:18,121
people a week.

1824
01:07:18,121 --> 01:07:21,600
Right now or be hooked to the power group
and people are getting access to fresh

1825
01:07:21,601 --> 01:07:26,460
water and the unprecedented rate and
infant mortality rates are declining

1826
01:07:26,461 --> 01:07:30,460
precipitously all over the world and the
world's fastest growing economies are

1827
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:35,250
in sub Saharan Africa and no one is
starving anywhere unless someone is trying

1828
01:07:35,251 --> 01:07:39,180
to start with to death because there's
actually enough food for everyone and it

1829
01:07:39,181 --> 01:07:40,890
doesn't look like you're going to run out.

1830
01:07:40,950 --> 01:07:44,820
Our population's going to peak at about
9 billion and we can probably handle

1831
01:07:44,821 --> 01:07:45,150
that.

1832
01:07:45,150 --> 01:07:48,240
Especially given current growth
rates in agricultural production.

1833
01:07:48,870 --> 01:07:49,141
You know,

1834
01:07:49,141 --> 01:07:52,500
it's so we did move into this
future that lies in front of us,

1835
01:07:52,530 --> 01:07:55,740
especially with this technological
prowess that would be developing.

1836
01:07:55,741 --> 01:07:58,080
That's absolutely remarkable.

1837
01:07:58,440 --> 01:07:59,040
We could,

1838
01:07:59,040 --> 01:08:03,060
we could move into this future and God
only knows how much of the actual tragedy

1839
01:08:03,061 --> 01:08:05,110
of life we could push to the back of that.

1840
01:08:05,120 --> 01:08:07,170
How much is the malevolence that corrupts?

1841
01:08:07,171 --> 01:08:08,640
If he could obliterate,

1842
01:08:08,641 --> 01:08:10,650
who knows how good we could make things,

1843
01:08:10,930 --> 01:08:14,040
it would you think what your old bedroom
and twisted because life is difficult.

1844
01:08:14,070 --> 01:08:15,570
If he'd betrayed like look,

1845
01:08:15,571 --> 01:08:16,131
fair enough,

1846
01:08:16,131 --> 01:08:16,640
man.

1847
01:08:16,640 --> 01:08:17,690
Life is difficult.

1848
01:08:17,691 --> 01:08:20,750
And you probably didn't leave the
trade and what are you going to do?

1849
01:08:20,800 --> 01:08:22,160
I'm gonna make it worse.

1850
01:08:22,790 --> 01:08:22,911
Well,

1851
01:08:22,911 --> 01:08:24,440
that's not going to get
you up in the morning,

1852
01:08:24,680 --> 01:08:24,951
right?

1853
01:08:24,951 --> 01:08:25,960
That's going to make you want to,

1854
01:08:26,240 --> 01:08:28,340
who knows what that's going
to make you want to do.

1855
01:08:28,700 --> 01:08:30,680
It's not going to make you want
to do something that's good,

1856
01:08:30,681 --> 01:08:31,550
that's for sure.

1857
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:32,840
Instead you can say,

1858
01:08:32,841 --> 01:08:33,081
well,

1859
01:08:33,081 --> 01:08:34,010
bring it on.

1860
01:08:34,190 --> 01:08:35,180
Like I can handle it.

1861
01:08:35,181 --> 01:08:36,920
Keep it except for one that voluntarily.

1862
01:08:37,190 --> 01:08:38,680
That's rule one quite the way.

1863
01:08:38,920 --> 01:08:41,330
Stand up straight with
your shoulders back.

1864
01:08:41,390 --> 01:08:42,890
That's the injunction.

1865
01:08:43,300 --> 01:08:44,210
It's like you can,

1866
01:08:44,240 --> 01:08:48,360
you can stand down and expose
yourself to the catastrophe.

1867
01:08:48,360 --> 01:08:48,921
That's the world.

1868
01:08:48,921 --> 01:08:53,921
You could take that arm
volunteerer as if there isn't,

1869
01:08:53,931 --> 01:08:56,570
if there's enough of you to manage it.

1870
01:08:56,870 --> 01:08:57,980
And the funny thing is,

1871
01:08:57,981 --> 01:08:59,230
the strange thing is,

1872
01:08:59,231 --> 01:09:00,010
is that,

1873
01:09:00,010 --> 01:09:01,420
and you know this already,

1874
01:09:02,020 --> 01:09:02,960
you know,

1875
01:09:03,220 --> 01:09:04,880
and if you're careful with yourself,

1876
01:09:05,300 --> 01:09:08,300
every time you take on
additional responsibility,

1877
01:09:08,510 --> 01:09:10,040
you grow more terror,

1878
01:09:10,410 --> 01:09:10,940
right?

1879
01:09:10,940 --> 01:09:12,380
That's how life works.

1880
01:09:12,850 --> 01:09:16,280
You don't get to grow more character
and strength without taking on the load.

1881
01:09:16,340 --> 01:09:17,031
You don't do that.

1882
01:09:17,031 --> 01:09:20,240
And then Jim Wright
develop your musculature.

1883
01:09:20,241 --> 01:09:23,030
We felt pushing the amount of
weight that you're lifting.

1884
01:09:23,090 --> 01:09:25,760
You can't just wish your
apostles into growth.

1885
01:09:26,120 --> 01:09:29,300
They have to demand that
they make themselves better.

1886
01:09:29,310 --> 01:09:30,140
Says,

1887
01:09:30,140 --> 01:09:30,270
oh,

1888
01:09:30,270 --> 01:09:32,590
your life is like that.

1889
01:09:32,620 --> 01:09:33,190
It's like,

1890
01:09:33,190 --> 01:09:33,350
well,

1891
01:09:33,350 --> 01:09:37,060
you have received calculable potential
that people are always calling you on.

1892
01:09:37,070 --> 01:09:38,770
You're not living up to your protection.

1893
01:09:39,010 --> 01:09:40,610
You don't moving up to your potential.

1894
01:09:41,060 --> 01:09:44,480
You say that to yourself and other people
say it too as well because they know

1895
01:09:44,481 --> 01:09:48,650
that he would hit you in some sense
is the ability to take the entire

1896
01:09:48,651 --> 01:09:52,280
catastrophe of the world on your shoulders
have to do everything you possibly

1897
01:09:52,281 --> 01:09:53,540
can to make it better.

1898
01:09:53,810 --> 01:09:55,700
And in that you find the meaning in life.

1899
01:09:55,701 --> 01:10:00,060
It makes all that to justify some of
that tragedy that maybe what you making,

1900
01:10:00,310 --> 01:10:02,000
I don't know if it
would make it desirable,

1901
01:10:02,001 --> 01:10:04,510
but it certainly makes it
acceptable as a church,

1902
01:10:04,720 --> 01:10:08,040
you need the challenge
and I think that the,

1903
01:10:08,120 --> 01:10:12,500
the possibilities that lay it open to us
perhaps more now than at any point you

1904
01:10:12,510 --> 01:10:14,810
can pastor virtually without limit.

1905
01:10:15,440 --> 01:10:15,801
And you know,

1906
01:10:15,801 --> 01:10:19,610
I would say that we're recruiting things
quite rapidly despite the fact that

1907
01:10:19,611 --> 01:10:22,460
we're actually stumbling
forth for quite blindly.

1908
01:10:22,820 --> 01:10:23,031
You know,

1909
01:10:23,031 --> 01:10:24,260
we can be more alert,

1910
01:10:24,290 --> 01:10:26,250
more awake and more committed to the good.

1911
01:10:26,330 --> 01:10:28,520
We are substantially a garland.

1912
01:10:28,670 --> 01:10:32,630
He knows how much we did accelerate what
we're doing and how good we can make

1913
01:10:32,631 --> 01:10:33,430
things.

1914
01:10:33,430 --> 01:10:33,841
And if you,

1915
01:10:33,841 --> 01:10:34,671
and if you're careful,

1916
01:10:34,671 --> 01:10:37,760
you could start that locally so
you don't cause too much trouble,

1917
01:10:37,761 --> 01:10:39,860
you can just figure out
what's wrong with you.

1918
01:10:39,920 --> 01:10:41,030
It just ask yourself,

1919
01:10:41,031 --> 01:10:46,031
you get a big list and then you can start
working on it point by point by bit.

1920
01:10:46,440 --> 01:10:46,671
Say,

1921
01:10:46,671 --> 01:10:47,280
look,

1922
01:10:47,280 --> 01:10:49,740
I'm going to make tomorrow a
little bit better than yesterday.

1923
01:10:49,850 --> 01:10:51,290
I'm going to do that iteratively get,

1924
01:10:51,291 --> 01:10:54,800
I'm going to do that every day and
I'm going to see what happens if I use

1925
01:10:54,801 --> 01:10:58,700
everything at my disposal to push back
against the catastrophe of the world.

1926
01:10:58,760 --> 01:11:00,680
Because maybe that would set things right.

1927
01:11:00,800 --> 01:11:02,780
And that's rule number six,

1928
01:11:02,781 --> 01:11:03,980
which is the one I'll close with.

1929
01:11:03,981 --> 01:11:08,000
Set your house in perfect order
before you criticize the world.

1930
01:11:08,270 --> 01:11:09,103
And so

1931
01:11:12,230 --> 01:11:14,520
[inaudible]

1932
01:11:16,510 --> 01:11:17,590
what there is to,

1933
01:11:17,591 --> 01:11:18,670
you know,

1934
01:11:18,760 --> 01:11:21,700
and if you take on the responsibility,

1935
01:11:21,880 --> 01:11:25,720
if you take on responsibility for the
fact that things aren't exactly how you

1936
01:11:25,721 --> 01:11:28,780
would want them to be and you've decided
to important to begin to set them

1937
01:11:28,781 --> 01:11:29,290
right,

1938
01:11:29,290 --> 01:11:33,370
it's possible that you mold
yourself across time into
precisely the person who's

1939
01:11:33,371 --> 01:11:34,690
capable of doing that.

1940
01:11:34,780 --> 01:11:35,920
And why wouldn't you?

1941
01:11:35,970 --> 01:11:37,420
That that's how it works.

1942
01:11:37,600 --> 01:11:41,170
And so it seems perfectly reasonable that
each of us could do that and god only

1943
01:11:41,171 --> 01:11:43,050
knows what would happen if we all did.

1944
01:11:43,360 --> 01:11:46,870
So it seems to me that it would be a
lovely thing for all of us to try and it's

1945
01:11:46,871 --> 01:11:48,760
a good time in the history of,

1946
01:11:48,970 --> 01:11:49,803
of our,

1947
01:11:49,810 --> 01:11:50,780
of our species,

1948
01:11:50,790 --> 01:11:53,800
let's say for us to wake
up and do precisely that.

1949
01:11:53,980 --> 01:11:55,570
So thank you.

1950
01:12:06,030 --> 01:12:11,030
[inaudible] [inaudible]

1951
01:12:40,220 --> 01:12:41,053
standing

1952
01:12:42,940 --> 01:12:46,050
up straight with your shoulders back.

1953
01:12:46,051 --> 01:12:46,884
Thank you.

1954
01:12:49,140 --> 01:12:49,973
Perfect.

1955
01:12:50,380 --> 01:12:52,650
A reasonable or I've been just a moment,

1956
01:12:52,710 --> 01:12:53,040
uh,

1957
01:12:53,040 --> 01:12:55,860
hopes of abusive in some
questions over the Internet.

1958
01:12:55,861 --> 01:12:56,730
We'll come back,

1959
01:12:56,790 --> 01:12:57,660
we'll have a seat.

1960
01:12:57,720 --> 01:12:59,160
We'll go into some of your questions.

1961
01:12:59,161 --> 01:13:00,720
We'll do about 30 minutes of Q and.

1962
01:13:00,721 --> 01:13:01,554
A.

1963
01:13:01,580 --> 01:13:02,310
Uh,

1964
01:13:02,310 --> 01:13:03,900
it has is going to be wonderful.

1965
01:13:04,320 --> 01:13:05,370
And then we have,

1966
01:13:05,400 --> 01:13:06,210
this is like the,

1967
01:13:06,210 --> 01:13:06,511
I don't know,

1968
01:13:06,511 --> 01:13:08,970
those 16th showing this
tour in every night.

1969
01:13:08,971 --> 01:13:10,230
Every lecture is different,

1970
01:13:10,500 --> 01:13:13,140
is just if you'd like to visit
us again and we've got to,

1971
01:13:13,340 --> 01:13:14,610
we're in the Minneapolis,

1972
01:13:14,660 --> 01:13:15,260
uh,

1973
01:13:15,260 --> 01:13:16,300
tomorrow night in Milwaukee,

1974
01:13:16,310 --> 01:13:18,750
Minneapolis up and then
a west coast swing.

1975
01:13:18,870 --> 01:13:20,910
And then we go a Canva in July.

1976
01:13:20,911 --> 01:13:24,270
So please feel free to join
us again for another lecture,

1977
01:13:25,070 --> 01:13:26,940
Dr. Peterson and be out here shortly.

1978
01:13:27,350 --> 01:13:27,760
And this is,

1979
01:13:27,760 --> 01:13:28,300
uh,

1980
01:13:28,300 --> 01:13:29,340
this is really a movement.

1981
01:13:29,341 --> 01:13:30,091
I think it's really,

1982
01:13:30,091 --> 01:13:31,000
it feels wonderful,

1983
01:13:31,050 --> 01:13:32,220
but you guys are here to z.

1984
01:13:33,610 --> 01:13:38,610
[inaudible]

1985
01:13:45,040 --> 01:13:46,260
are you guys ready for the Q and a

1986
01:13:50,910 --> 01:13:55,910
[inaudible]

1987
01:14:04,590 --> 01:14:05,423
great job.

1988
01:14:15,990 --> 01:14:16,360
Okay,

1989
01:14:16,360 --> 01:14:17,410
so here's a question.

1990
01:14:17,411 --> 01:14:18,460
We'll start with this one.

1991
01:14:19,870 --> 01:14:21,820
Are you aware that today,

1992
01:14:22,330 --> 01:14:23,350
yes,

1993
01:14:23,410 --> 01:14:28,410
today is national law
or day [inaudible] no.

1994
01:14:40,470 --> 01:14:40,721
No.

1995
01:14:40,721 --> 01:14:43,670
I wasn't aware of [inaudible].

1996
01:14:43,840 --> 01:14:44,081
Okay.

1997
01:14:44,081 --> 01:14:45,700
So that's pretty damn funny.

1998
01:14:46,750 --> 01:14:47,100
Okay.

1999
01:14:47,100 --> 01:14:48,280
So here's another thing.

2000
01:14:48,890 --> 01:14:49,990
Get this at all.

2001
01:14:49,991 --> 01:14:51,340
This is quite the street.

2002
01:14:51,520 --> 01:14:56,520
So are we trying to group how
to tie a Windsor Knot in my tie?

2003
01:14:57,160 --> 01:15:02,020
And so I just started that like two
days ago because I have this pit and tie

2004
01:15:02,021 --> 01:15:03,190
that does look quite pregnant,

2005
01:15:03,200 --> 01:15:04,180
total wins or not.

2006
01:15:04,181 --> 01:15:07,000
And then there's a question here that's,

2007
01:15:07,120 --> 01:15:10,040
that'd be just trying to
understand why the world was,

2008
01:15:10,150 --> 01:15:13,090
have you thought about
switching to the full Windsor?

2009
01:15:16,290 --> 01:15:17,123
Yes.

2010
01:15:17,210 --> 01:15:22,210
[inaudible] I don't know
what in the world to,

2011
01:15:24,210 --> 01:15:25,043
to,

2012
01:15:26,040 --> 01:15:27,730
she knows what to do about that,

2013
01:15:27,790 --> 01:15:28,623
that's for sure.

2014
01:15:29,350 --> 01:15:30,183
Okay.

2015
01:15:30,190 --> 01:15:30,820
Um,

2016
01:15:30,820 --> 01:15:35,060
you've accumulated fade so
quickly over the last few years.

2017
01:15:35,330 --> 01:15:38,140
You keep yourself humble.

2018
01:15:38,260 --> 01:15:39,700
And then there's some
other questions like,

2019
01:15:40,120 --> 01:15:41,890
which is quite similar,

2020
01:15:41,891 --> 01:15:42,531
which is,

2021
01:15:42,531 --> 01:15:43,364
um,

2022
01:15:44,230 --> 01:15:47,500
where do you do to protect yourself
from corruption since being put on a

2023
01:15:47,501 --> 01:15:48,161
pedestal?

2024
01:15:48,161 --> 01:15:51,760
What can do in the same situation?

2025
01:15:52,120 --> 01:15:52,421
Wow.

2026
01:15:52,421 --> 01:15:52,751
Okay.

2027
01:15:52,751 --> 01:15:53,584
So let's,

2028
01:15:53,590 --> 01:15:54,850
let's answer those.

2029
01:15:55,210 --> 01:15:56,043
Uh,

2030
01:15:57,100 --> 01:15:57,970
well,

2031
01:15:58,390 --> 01:16:02,620
I do these sorts of things that
I was talking about to you today.

2032
01:16:02,650 --> 01:16:02,921
You know,

2033
01:16:02,921 --> 01:16:04,800
I have an eight,

2034
01:16:05,410 --> 01:16:08,890
let's say that I've thought
through very deeply,

2035
01:16:09,360 --> 01:16:09,820
I mean,

2036
01:16:09,820 --> 01:16:11,320
when I wrote my first book,

2037
01:16:11,321 --> 01:16:12,370
which I told you about,

2038
01:16:12,430 --> 01:16:14,730
and I hope you have version maps,

2039
01:16:14,740 --> 01:16:15,573
VT,

2040
01:16:15,990 --> 01:16:16,823
um,

2041
01:16:17,020 --> 01:16:21,100
I thought about what
happened in Auschwitz.

2042
01:16:22,690 --> 01:16:25,900
I thought about it from the
perspective of a perpetrator,

2043
01:16:26,290 --> 01:16:30,190
not from the perspective
of a bystander or a victim.

2044
01:16:30,430 --> 01:16:31,263
Let's say.

2045
01:16:31,810 --> 01:16:32,680
I thought,

2046
01:16:33,070 --> 01:16:37,900
how is it that people could do what
was done in Auschwitz by the guards?

2047
01:16:38,230 --> 01:16:41,170
But I thought hope that
more specifically I thought,

2048
01:16:41,230 --> 01:16:45,610
how is it that that person who is human
could do that given that I'm also human

2049
01:16:45,611 --> 01:16:47,230
and I can't see how I could do that.

2050
01:16:48,310 --> 01:16:51,490
And then I thought about until I
could figure out how we could do it

2051
01:16:53,680 --> 01:16:54,580
and so,

2052
01:16:54,970 --> 01:16:56,760
and then I figured out that I could do,

2053
01:16:58,020 --> 01:17:00,310
then I figured out that I
could probably enjoy it.

2054
01:17:02,830 --> 01:17:06,490
And so that scared me enough so that I
figured out that I tried to see what the

2055
01:17:06,491 --> 01:17:07,540
answer to that one,

2056
01:17:08,570 --> 01:17:09,260
you know,

2057
01:17:09,260 --> 01:17:10,950
up as far away as possible.

2058
01:17:12,420 --> 01:17:15,950
And so I would say that part of what
I do to keep my feet on the ground,

2059
01:17:15,951 --> 01:17:17,330
which I written for the offense,

2060
01:17:17,331 --> 01:17:18,440
capacity for evil,

2061
01:17:18,441 --> 01:17:20,810
that every single one of
us is characterized by,

2062
01:17:21,590 --> 01:17:24,020
and I terrified enough with that,

2063
01:17:24,021 --> 01:17:27,350
that say to try to Orient
Myself property in the world,

2064
01:17:27,660 --> 01:17:30,450
say that fear of God is
the beginning of quiz.

2065
01:17:30,650 --> 01:17:32,060
That's a good way of thinking about,

2066
01:17:32,660 --> 01:17:33,493
you could say

2067
01:17:40,300 --> 01:17:43,300
people conceptualize let's say,

2068
01:17:43,330 --> 01:17:46,780
because if you want to keep
yourself on the up and up,

2069
01:17:46,840 --> 01:17:49,000
it's one thing to be ab for heaven,

2070
01:17:49,020 --> 01:17:50,970
but it's another thing
to be a big weights.

2071
01:17:51,410 --> 01:17:54,140
And I don't care how cynical you are,

2072
01:17:54,190 --> 01:17:56,530
you can be cynical enough so
that you don't believe in heaven.

2073
01:17:57,130 --> 01:18:00,700
There's no way you can be cynical enough
so that you don't believe in hell.

2074
01:18:01,750 --> 01:18:05,140
And so once I've established that
if you have any sense of the hall,

2075
01:18:05,141 --> 01:18:06,910
then at least you could
aim away from that.

2076
01:18:07,480 --> 01:18:11,230
And if that's what you're doing and you
know how deep that place where he is,

2077
01:18:11,470 --> 01:18:13,840
then that can help you keep
your feet on the ground.

2078
01:18:14,320 --> 01:18:15,850
That's what it looks up to me.

2079
01:18:16,120 --> 01:18:17,560
So that's one of the answers.

2080
01:18:17,561 --> 01:18:20,350
I try to eat as far away
from that as possible.

2081
01:18:20,730 --> 01:18:23,020
So that's part of what I laid up tonight.

2082
01:18:23,040 --> 01:18:25,480
Just like what am I trying to do?

2083
01:18:26,180 --> 01:18:27,013
Well,

2084
01:18:27,430 --> 01:18:28,850
I have my flaws and so no,

2085
01:18:29,170 --> 01:18:30,430
I'm not doing this perfectly,

2086
01:18:30,431 --> 01:18:30,971
but I'm dancing.

2087
01:18:30,971 --> 01:18:33,220
I'm trying to aim a week from that.

2088
01:18:33,490 --> 01:18:35,160
Tried to take care of herself,

2089
01:18:35,890 --> 01:18:39,510
trying to take care of herself in a
way that is maximally beneficial to buy

2090
01:18:39,511 --> 01:18:40,344
salmon.

2091
01:18:40,900 --> 01:18:44,470
And I'm trying to do both of them was
in a way that's maximally beneficial to

2092
01:18:44,471 --> 01:18:45,370
the community.

2093
01:18:45,970 --> 01:18:47,140
That's what I'm trying to do with.

2094
01:18:47,141 --> 01:18:51,190
The reason I'm trying to do that is
partly because that's the best way a wave

2095
01:18:51,200 --> 01:18:52,260
from hell sort of.

2096
01:18:52,310 --> 01:18:53,470
That's a pretty good start.

2097
01:18:53,471 --> 01:18:58,471
But I also feeling that because I can't
think of anything better possibly to do.

2098
01:18:59,160 --> 01:19:02,310
And so it's a immense
challenge to do that.

2099
01:19:02,320 --> 01:19:03,640
And you need a challenge,

2100
01:19:04,030 --> 01:19:04,301
right?

2101
01:19:04,301 --> 01:19:06,280
And so why not have that as a challenge?

2102
01:19:07,190 --> 01:19:08,890
And I've talked these things through.

2103
01:19:08,891 --> 01:19:10,810
They're not shallow commitments.

2104
01:19:10,900 --> 01:19:14,150
That doesn't mean that I'm
with error right there.

2105
01:19:15,050 --> 01:19:17,770
So then the other thing
that you have to do,

2106
01:19:17,800 --> 01:19:19,440
if you want to stop yourself for big,

2107
01:19:19,450 --> 01:19:23,050
corrupt it is you want to surround
yourself with the right people.

2108
01:19:23,760 --> 01:19:27,940
I know rule wonders stamp at straight
with your shoulders back rule to it's

2109
01:19:27,941 --> 01:19:31,240
treat yourself like you're someone
you're responsible for helping.

2110
01:19:31,560 --> 01:19:32,980
And we're all three years,

2111
01:19:33,010 --> 01:19:35,920
make friends with the people
who want the best for him.

2112
01:19:36,760 --> 01:19:41,200
And those aren't injunctions about
how to have a happier life there.

2113
01:19:41,260 --> 01:19:44,410
Injunctions about how to
act morally in the world.

2114
01:19:44,470 --> 01:19:48,190
You need to take care of yourself like
you're someone who's worthwhile and you

2115
01:19:48,191 --> 01:19:51,700
need to have people around
you view you in the same way.

2116
01:19:51,970 --> 01:19:53,830
That doesn't mean they're
letting you off the hook.

2117
01:19:54,400 --> 01:19:55,420
Quite the contrary.

2118
01:19:55,440 --> 01:19:56,980
And so I'm fortunate,

2119
01:19:57,670 --> 01:19:59,740
I have two kids,

2120
01:20:00,010 --> 01:20:03,220
they're both very sensible and their eyes
are open and they're watching what I'm

2121
01:20:03,221 --> 01:20:08,221
doing and if I make a mistake or they
don't make a mistake or not be cautious

2122
01:20:08,461 --> 01:20:08,730
enough,

2123
01:20:08,730 --> 01:20:12,950
they telling me why something takes
away my Twitter password all the time.

2124
01:20:17,480 --> 01:20:17,990
Yeah,

2125
01:20:17,990 --> 01:20:18,290
yeah,

2126
01:20:18,290 --> 01:20:18,640
no.

2127
01:20:18,640 --> 01:20:19,041
And you know,

2128
01:20:19,041 --> 01:20:20,080
I can get it back,

2129
01:20:20,930 --> 01:20:21,880
reset the password,

2130
01:20:21,910 --> 01:20:23,320
but it's how you relate to him too.

2131
01:20:23,380 --> 01:20:24,020
You know.

2132
01:20:24,020 --> 01:20:28,210
So I don't like traveling with my
wife and she keeps an eye on me.

2133
01:20:28,220 --> 01:20:28,790
She's,

2134
01:20:28,790 --> 01:20:31,420
she's always in the crowd and
she sees what's happening.

2135
01:20:31,640 --> 01:20:35,520
She's a sensible person that she's
picked tempered in your own inner fire.

2136
01:20:35,810 --> 01:20:39,590
So she watches and then I have friends
around me and an extended family and

2137
01:20:39,591 --> 01:20:42,080
they're all watching and
they are not hesitate.

2138
01:20:42,110 --> 01:20:44,090
They don't hesitate at all to do,

2139
01:20:44,140 --> 01:20:46,400
let me know if they think that
what I'm doing is working.

2140
01:20:46,401 --> 01:20:48,830
But if it's not working and
they take our greatest mistake,

2141
01:20:48,831 --> 01:20:51,950
it's like we have a phone call and they
told me exactly what they think I did

2142
01:20:51,951 --> 01:20:53,900
wrong and how are we going
to fix it and how you listen.

2143
01:20:54,380 --> 01:20:58,400
Because I don't want to do any more
things wrong than absolutely necessary.

2144
01:20:59,060 --> 01:21:02,780
And so I would say part of the reasons
that I keep my feet on the ground,

2145
01:21:03,250 --> 01:21:06,530
cause I hate to say I keep myself humble
because I don't want to claim that,

2146
01:21:06,620 --> 01:21:08,530
but I'm trying to keep
my feet on the ground.

2147
01:21:08,531 --> 01:21:12,440
Is because I'm properly
terrified of doing things wrong.

2148
01:21:13,160 --> 01:21:16,430
And so I'd do my best to be
very careful about what I say,

2149
01:21:16,490 --> 01:21:17,051
what I do,

2150
01:21:17,051 --> 01:21:21,800
and so far that has produced
any catastrophic consequences.

2151
01:21:21,801 --> 01:21:23,300
So parades of that.

2152
01:21:23,590 --> 01:21:24,423
So,

2153
01:21:31,580 --> 01:21:32,060
okay,

2154
01:21:32,060 --> 01:21:32,893
well

2155
01:21:34,220 --> 01:21:35,720
this is very serious.

2156
01:21:35,810 --> 01:21:38,990
I don't know if I should address
it because I was somewhat tired,

2157
01:21:39,050 --> 01:21:43,630
but I'll give it a shot because it's
important how it's very serious troubles.

2158
01:21:44,600 --> 01:21:46,960
I plan on taking my own lights very soon.

2159
01:21:48,380 --> 01:21:49,213
Why it should?

2160
01:21:51,660 --> 01:21:52,493
Well,

2161
01:21:54,770 --> 01:21:55,440
I'm going to sit.

2162
01:21:55,440 --> 01:21:57,010
This is a casual request,

2163
01:21:57,250 --> 01:21:57,740
you know,

2164
01:21:57,740 --> 01:22:00,950
let's be put out for
the purposes of display.

2165
01:22:01,820 --> 01:22:01,941
Well,

2166
01:22:01,941 --> 01:22:06,941
the first thing I would say is you have
to think very carefully through the

2167
01:22:07,341 --> 01:22:09,440
consequences of that for other people.

2168
01:22:10,580 --> 01:22:14,510
So I've had clients in my clinical
practice with never recovered from the

2169
01:22:14,511 --> 01:22:17,570
suicide of her family
member decades later.

2170
01:22:17,630 --> 01:22:19,490
They were still torturing
yourself above it.

2171
01:22:19,910 --> 01:22:21,420
And so that's what you leave behind.

2172
01:22:21,650 --> 01:22:22,160
Now,

2173
01:22:22,160 --> 01:22:23,750
problem is you might be dreaming.

2174
01:22:25,010 --> 01:22:29,060
Maybe you're feeling like this big twist
is against you and that people deserve

2175
01:22:29,061 --> 01:22:31,520
to suffer for the misery
that they imposed upon you.

2176
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:33,550
That I would say think very,

2177
01:22:33,551 --> 01:22:35,840
very carefully before
you pull down that route.

2178
01:22:36,970 --> 01:22:41,260
It's a terrible thing to leave people
with and so part of the reason that

2179
01:22:41,280 --> 01:22:46,280
suicide has legal legally post societies
is because it absolutely devastates the

2180
01:22:47,210 --> 01:22:49,660
people you leave behind and
you might take what made,

2181
01:22:49,680 --> 01:22:49,920
you know,

2182
01:22:49,920 --> 01:22:51,040
if you're really depressed,

2183
01:22:51,080 --> 01:22:52,550
maybe you're really depressed.

2184
01:22:52,610 --> 01:22:53,630
That's a possibility.

2185
01:22:54,890 --> 01:22:57,680
He might take all those people
would be better off without me.

2186
01:22:57,800 --> 01:22:59,570
It's like it makes you
get really depressed,

2187
01:22:59,571 --> 01:23:03,080
you fatigue that way we can even get
to the point where you can't think any

2188
01:23:03,081 --> 01:23:08,081
other way that and would say if you're
at the point where you can't think any

2189
01:23:08,711 --> 01:23:09,580
other way than that,

2190
01:23:09,581 --> 01:23:13,840
that you should tell someone and you
should go to the hospital because that can

2191
01:23:13,841 --> 01:23:14,674
happen.

2192
01:23:14,710 --> 01:23:16,480
It can happen if you get depressed.

2193
01:23:16,660 --> 01:23:18,400
There are treatments for depression,

2194
01:23:18,880 --> 01:23:19,181
you know,

2195
01:23:19,181 --> 01:23:21,580
and many of them work for some people,

2196
01:23:21,581 --> 01:23:22,414
antidepressants,

2197
01:23:22,420 --> 01:23:26,830
work Matt out that don't work for
everyone and not claiming that they're a

2198
01:23:26,831 --> 01:23:27,664
panacea,

2199
01:23:27,880 --> 01:23:30,610
but they certainly beat
the hell out of suicide.

2200
01:23:31,060 --> 01:23:31,520
Right.

2201
01:23:31,520 --> 01:23:34,750
Even if they have some negative side
effects and sometimes they do quite

2202
01:23:34,751 --> 01:23:35,830
frequently they do.

2203
01:23:36,270 --> 01:23:38,710
The negative side effects aren't fatal.

2204
01:23:39,280 --> 01:23:44,280
It's like well are certainly there's a
possibility that that that your condition

2205
01:23:45,071 --> 01:23:46,150
is physical,

2206
01:23:46,180 --> 01:23:47,980
that you're ill in some way,

2207
01:23:48,040 --> 01:23:51,670
either physically or perhaps you have a
psychological problem and maybe you were

2208
01:23:51,671 --> 01:23:53,230
hurt her or,

2209
01:23:53,350 --> 01:23:55,810
I mean there's lots of reasons that
people get depressed that are very,

2210
01:23:55,811 --> 01:23:56,591
very complex.

2211
01:23:56,591 --> 01:23:58,420
I would say don't give up hope without,

2212
01:23:58,610 --> 01:24:03,060
don't give up hope and do something fine
up before you've explored all possible

2213
01:24:03,061 --> 01:24:06,070
the auctions and if you haven't
talked to a psychologist,

2214
01:24:06,071 --> 01:24:07,540
you haven't talked to a psychiatrist,

2215
01:24:07,541 --> 01:24:11,110
you have to try and antidepressants
you haven't revealed to your family or

2216
01:24:11,111 --> 01:24:13,330
people that care for you that
this is how you're feeling.

2217
01:24:13,331 --> 01:24:18,331
Then you owe it to yourself and them to
explore every possible avenue before you

2218
01:24:18,701 --> 01:24:23,701
take such a step and then you don't
want to deprive the world of who I've of

2219
01:24:23,801 --> 01:24:25,840
what you could bring to the world.

2220
01:24:26,050 --> 01:24:26,890
That's the other thing.

2221
01:24:26,920 --> 01:24:30,460
You know you have intrinsic
value and you can't just cash.

2222
01:24:30,461 --> 01:24:31,510
We couldn't have to an end.

2223
01:24:31,520 --> 01:24:34,330
You leave a hole in the
fabric of be itself.

2224
01:24:34,720 --> 01:24:35,860
So you know,

2225
01:24:35,910 --> 01:24:38,470
and why is that that I
once worked with Sam,

2226
01:24:38,530 --> 01:24:39,790
he was a very strange person.

2227
01:24:39,791 --> 01:24:40,870
He was a psychologist,

2228
01:24:40,871 --> 01:24:44,010
have to admit maximum
security prison and Edmonton.

2229
01:24:44,011 --> 01:24:45,670
And I worked with him for a while,

2230
01:24:45,730 --> 01:24:46,270
briefly,

2231
01:24:46,270 --> 01:24:48,130
very briefly up the prison itself.

2232
01:24:48,131 --> 01:24:48,970
And he said,

2233
01:24:49,300 --> 01:24:51,550
you can always commit suicide tomorrow.

2234
01:24:52,710 --> 01:24:54,550
And that's a very,

2235
01:24:54,580 --> 01:24:54,761
like,

2236
01:24:54,761 --> 01:24:56,680
it's a flippant statement in some sense,

2237
01:24:56,681 --> 01:24:58,500
but he meant it in a very serious way.

2238
01:24:58,501 --> 01:25:03,501
It's like you only get to decide
that once and you can put it off.

2239
01:25:04,630 --> 01:25:08,950
So I would say just put it off and then
put it off score and then put it off

2240
01:25:08,951 --> 01:25:12,820
some more and see what you can
do to put yourself together.

2241
01:25:13,270 --> 01:25:16,240
You don't explore every possible option.

2242
01:25:16,870 --> 01:25:17,441
And if,

2243
01:25:17,441 --> 01:25:17,891
if you're,

2244
01:25:17,891 --> 01:25:21,400
if you're so hopeless that
you have a suicidal plan,

2245
01:25:21,610 --> 01:25:23,050
which is a real sign of danger.

2246
01:25:23,051 --> 01:25:24,480
If you really know how you do it,

2247
01:25:24,490 --> 01:25:25,840
you've thought about denim and say,

2248
01:25:26,140 --> 01:25:27,760
tell someone for God's sake,

2249
01:25:27,761 --> 01:25:30,940
tell them at or goil
hospital and tell them.

2250
01:25:31,420 --> 01:25:33,250
And for sure trying to depress.

2251
01:25:33,251 --> 01:25:33,730
It's like,

2252
01:25:33,730 --> 01:25:35,290
what the hell do you have to lose?

2253
01:25:36,010 --> 01:25:41,010
So do everything you possibly can to
address the issue before you do something

2254
01:25:42,491 --> 01:25:43,270
like that.

2255
01:25:43,270 --> 01:25:45,940
Do give some thought to the people
that you're going to leave behind.

2256
01:25:45,941 --> 01:25:46,771
Because believe me,

2257
01:25:46,771 --> 01:25:48,730
you may just absolutely
wait for the moment,

2258
01:25:48,731 --> 01:25:50,490
the way that they will
never recover from it.

2259
01:25:50,680 --> 01:25:53,940
You cannot fix someone's suicide.

2260
01:25:54,310 --> 01:25:58,150
You're stuck with it and you think you
torture yourself from the rest of your

2261
01:25:58,151 --> 01:25:58,660
life.

2262
01:25:58,660 --> 01:26:02,110
If I would have only known if I would
have only said something different,

2263
01:26:02,140 --> 01:26:04,310
this particular talked to her,

2264
01:26:04,340 --> 01:26:05,173
her relative,

2265
01:26:05,410 --> 01:26:09,410
a sibling who committed suicide like
20 minutes before he committed suicide

2266
01:26:09,440 --> 01:26:13,640
probably after he took the pills and
she was kind of preoccupied because he

2267
01:26:13,641 --> 01:26:15,380
don't know that the
person at the other end,

2268
01:26:15,381 --> 01:26:18,620
because at the end of their Kevin and
she never forgave yourself from how it

2269
01:26:18,621 --> 01:26:19,090
respond.

2270
01:26:19,090 --> 01:26:21,170
Big Property in that last phone call,

2271
01:26:21,410 --> 01:26:22,410
that's a hell of a thing.

2272
01:26:22,411 --> 01:26:23,450
Delete someone with,

2273
01:26:24,590 --> 01:26:29,590
so I would say of the final thing I would
say is don't be so sure that your life

2274
01:26:29,841 --> 01:26:30,980
is yours to take.

2275
01:26:32,150 --> 01:26:32,421
You know,

2276
01:26:32,421 --> 01:26:35,180
you don't own yourself the
way that you own an object,

2277
01:26:35,480 --> 01:26:37,790
you have a moral obligation
to yourself as a,

2278
01:26:37,850 --> 01:26:39,830
as a locus of divine value.

2279
01:26:39,860 --> 01:26:40,693
Let's say.

2280
01:26:40,760 --> 01:26:42,220
You can treat that counseling,

2281
01:26:42,820 --> 01:26:43,370
that's theirs,

2282
01:26:43,370 --> 01:26:44,330
it's wrong.

2283
01:26:44,360 --> 01:26:45,950
So those are the reasons.

2284
01:26:47,090 --> 01:26:50,270
Exploring everything you can explore
to put yourself back on your feet,

2285
01:26:50,720 --> 01:26:51,471
all the things.

2286
01:26:51,471 --> 01:26:53,290
There's all sorts of
treatments for depression.

2287
01:26:54,290 --> 01:26:58,700
Don't leave the people around you with
that to suffer for the rest of the Lux.

2288
01:26:59,090 --> 01:27:03,920
Don't underestimate your value in the
world at don't underestimate the fact that

2289
01:27:03,921 --> 01:27:05,300
suicide is broad.

2290
01:27:05,870 --> 01:27:10,430
And so those are four reasons why you
should end your life soon or at all for

2291
01:27:10,431 --> 01:27:11,264
that.

2292
01:27:12,640 --> 01:27:13,490
So good luck.

2293
01:27:13,910 --> 01:27:18,910
[inaudible]

2294
01:27:25,580 --> 01:27:28,460
I am the harvest at Herron art school.

2295
01:27:28,550 --> 01:27:33,050
What's your advice for young artists
trying to shatter the conventions of

2296
01:27:33,051 --> 01:27:34,430
political correctness?

2297
01:27:35,310 --> 01:27:35,670
Well,

2298
01:27:35,670 --> 01:27:38,630
the first one that we probably
get the hell out of art school

2299
01:27:38,640 --> 01:27:43,640
[inaudible] that's actually fairly

2300
01:27:48,300 --> 01:27:53,300
fairly straight forward if you want to
shatter the conventions of political

2301
01:27:54,601 --> 01:27:55,171
correctness,

2302
01:27:55,171 --> 01:27:55,740
which is,

2303
01:27:55,740 --> 01:28:00,060
I don't take any field has been
warped or thoroughly that fine art.

2304
01:28:00,070 --> 01:28:01,830
Quite quite political correctness,

2305
01:28:01,831 --> 01:28:02,430
you know,

2306
01:28:02,430 --> 01:28:02,671
so,

2307
01:28:02,671 --> 01:28:06,160
and that's really saying something because
plenty of fields if the lenti work,

2308
01:28:06,410 --> 01:28:08,010
but I would say your best,

2309
01:28:08,310 --> 01:28:09,970
your best bet is two fold.

2310
01:28:09,980 --> 01:28:13,050
One is learn how to manage your
career in effective business,

2311
01:28:13,051 --> 01:28:13,884
like manner,

2312
01:28:14,130 --> 01:28:17,400
make yourself come through in terms of
putting yourself together economically.

2313
01:28:17,790 --> 01:28:19,800
Because if you're going to be really,

2314
01:28:19,830 --> 01:28:20,550
really,

2315
01:28:20,550 --> 01:28:21,510
really,

2316
01:28:21,690 --> 01:28:22,530
really,

2317
01:28:22,980 --> 01:28:26,580
really hard to monetize
statistic production.

2318
01:28:27,090 --> 01:28:29,520
And so if you're going to
support yourself being an artist,

2319
01:28:29,521 --> 01:28:31,290
you better be a sharp is this person.

2320
01:28:31,320 --> 01:28:35,100
There's nothing that irritates political
correct people more than that in that

2321
01:28:35,101 --> 01:28:35,850
development.

2322
01:28:35,850 --> 01:28:37,440
So you could start by that.

2323
01:28:37,441 --> 01:28:41,160
It's like develop yourself into a cabinet
negotiator and see if you could figure

2324
01:28:41,161 --> 01:28:43,530
out how you could actually
have a career as an artist.

2325
01:28:43,770 --> 01:28:44,940
I would say to begin with,

2326
01:28:44,941 --> 01:28:48,300
what you're probably going to have to
do is have an actual job and do your art

2327
01:28:48,360 --> 01:28:49,380
art time because,

2328
01:28:49,680 --> 01:28:54,680
and let us your fed globally tell it to
that even that it probably won't work.

2329
01:28:55,020 --> 01:28:59,820
So you could even have the jaw and then
you could work really hard on your art.

2330
01:28:59,821 --> 01:29:02,250
And with any luck over the
period of about a decade,

2331
01:29:02,280 --> 01:29:03,730
you can build connection that works.

2332
01:29:03,731 --> 01:29:07,440
If you could learn how the gallery
system works and you could be influential

2333
01:29:07,500 --> 01:29:08,940
people and you can sell your art,

2334
01:29:09,010 --> 01:29:11,010
maybe you could start to figure
out how to make a living.

2335
01:29:11,580 --> 01:29:12,331
You got to figure it out.

2336
01:29:12,331 --> 01:29:16,520
It's going to take like 25 30% of your
client at an absence and then you might

2337
01:29:16,521 --> 01:29:19,710
totally agreed with that and
that'll irritate the hell
out with your politically

2338
01:29:19,711 --> 01:29:20,700
correct Coles.

2339
01:29:20,910 --> 01:29:25,440
So because they'll say you sold out
and people who say that those are,

2340
01:29:25,450 --> 01:29:28,440
we never have the opportunity to sell out,

2341
01:29:38,550 --> 01:29:42,960
justify that absolute
moral respectability.

2342
01:29:43,010 --> 01:29:44,430
So it's an appalling gate.

2343
01:29:44,610 --> 01:29:49,610
The other thing you can do is study
great artists throughout history and then

2344
01:29:50,041 --> 01:29:54,120
hone your craft because there's this
idea of it's sort of a postmodern idea

2345
01:29:54,121 --> 01:29:54,600
that,

2346
01:29:54,600 --> 01:29:54,841
well,

2347
01:29:54,841 --> 01:29:56,490
it's all freedom of expression.

2348
01:29:56,491 --> 01:29:57,840
You don't need any skill.

2349
01:29:57,900 --> 01:29:59,310
It's like that's,

2350
01:30:00,450 --> 01:30:01,283
that's not,

2351
01:30:01,490 --> 01:30:02,610
that's not wrong.

2352
01:30:02,611 --> 01:30:05,460
It's like anti true.

2353
01:30:07,750 --> 01:30:08,940
It's not just an error.

2354
01:30:08,990 --> 01:30:09,331
It's like,

2355
01:30:09,331 --> 01:30:13,870
you know what the truth is it then you
figure out the exact opposite of that and

2356
01:30:14,440 --> 01:30:16,350
put that forward as a proposition.

2357
01:30:16,351 --> 01:30:18,540
It's like develop your skill,

2358
01:30:18,570 --> 01:30:19,190
you know,

2359
01:30:19,190 --> 01:30:24,190
they're the pain to draw the scope
to things and graphics person.

2360
01:30:26,130 --> 01:30:29,280
All these things develop
your skill and then,

2361
01:30:29,370 --> 01:30:30,870
and your discipline as well.

2362
01:30:30,871 --> 01:30:34,320
And then maybe you'll be able to transcend
that discipline with the skill and

2363
01:30:34,321 --> 01:30:35,910
produce something truly original.

2364
01:30:36,330 --> 01:30:38,610
But you could make yourself,

2365
01:30:38,670 --> 01:30:42,240
you could master the techniques of the
great artists of the past and you know,

2366
01:30:42,241 --> 01:30:42,630
the,

2367
01:30:42,630 --> 01:30:43,710
the trending types to say,

2368
01:30:43,711 --> 01:30:44,840
well that's all past set.

2369
01:30:44,841 --> 01:30:45,241
It's like,

2370
01:30:45,241 --> 01:30:48,660
it's not nearly as passe as their demo
opinions are going to be 10 years from

2371
01:30:48,661 --> 01:30:49,494
now.

2372
01:30:49,550 --> 01:30:50,383
Wow.

2373
01:30:56,850 --> 01:30:57,210
Started

2374
01:30:57,210 --> 01:30:58,150
an interesting guy.

2375
01:30:58,151 --> 01:30:59,740
You can find him on Youtube.

2376
01:30:59,741 --> 01:31:02,920
His name is Jonathan powershell and he's,

2377
01:31:02,950 --> 01:31:03,520
he was,

2378
01:31:03,520 --> 01:31:06,810
he was in an art school like you
at a place called [inaudible],

2379
01:31:06,850 --> 01:31:09,370
which is like mind boggling
late politically correct.

2380
01:31:09,820 --> 01:31:13,390
He was actually a pretty
good postmodernist score.

2381
01:31:13,430 --> 01:31:13,880
It is.

2382
01:31:13,880 --> 01:31:14,713
Right.

2383
01:31:14,740 --> 01:31:18,340
And he got completely tired
of the political correctness
that characterize the

2384
01:31:18,341 --> 01:31:23,320
art schools and he became a
medieval carver of orthodox icons.

2385
01:31:23,380 --> 01:31:24,300
That was his,

2386
01:31:24,420 --> 01:31:26,410
his reaction against the,

2387
01:31:26,750 --> 01:31:27,630
you know the training,

2388
01:31:27,631 --> 01:31:32,410
political politically correct orthodox
and he makes absolutely beautiful pieces.

2389
01:31:32,560 --> 01:31:33,700
They're worth taking a look at,

2390
01:31:33,720 --> 01:31:38,060
so that was Jonathan how now when he's
making youtube videos about syphilis,

2391
01:31:38,260 --> 01:31:39,430
Christian art that are really,

2392
01:31:39,431 --> 01:31:40,510
really quite good.

2393
01:31:40,660 --> 01:31:42,580
He's actually making a
living doing that way too.

2394
01:31:42,730 --> 01:31:43,880
That's so funny.

2395
01:31:44,160 --> 01:31:44,993
It's like,

2396
01:31:45,450 --> 01:31:47,570
imagine how are we there yet?

2397
01:31:47,630 --> 01:31:49,820
Was is that there were firsties Canadian.

2398
01:31:49,821 --> 01:31:51,030
Then second of all cigarettes,

2399
01:31:51,031 --> 01:31:56,031
if I'm liking it to get the second is
that he's making a living talking about

2400
01:31:56,651 --> 01:31:59,670
carving Orthodox Christian icons.

2401
01:31:59,980 --> 01:32:03,000
It's like no one will ever
make a living doing that.

2402
01:32:04,200 --> 01:32:08,490
Know he decided that he was going
to do exactly what you want to do,

2403
01:32:08,570 --> 01:32:12,400
which you don't want to shatter the
conventions of political correctness.

2404
01:32:12,401 --> 01:32:15,490
You want to be an artist
and if you are an artist,

2405
01:32:15,610 --> 01:32:19,630
see an artist is also someone who an
artist is someone who produces art.

2406
01:32:19,910 --> 01:32:21,850
It's like that's a big mistake.

2407
01:32:22,180 --> 01:32:26,110
And artist is someone who uses our as
a tool to investigate the structure of

2408
01:32:26,111 --> 01:32:29,650
reality and to extend the
human capacity to perceive.

2409
01:32:29,710 --> 01:32:31,660
That's where the harm ducks and artists

2410
01:32:31,960 --> 01:32:32,381
really,

2411
01:32:32,381 --> 01:32:37,381
really grieving [inaudible] skill

2412
01:32:42,140 --> 01:32:46,040
so that you can extend the limits of
the human relationship with beauty and

2413
01:32:46,041 --> 01:32:46,401
truth.

2414
01:32:46,401 --> 01:32:50,330
And you can transform the manner in which
people perceive so that they can see

2415
01:32:50,331 --> 01:32:52,610
beauty when they only soft memory before.

2416
01:32:52,790 --> 01:32:53,990
That's what you want to do.

2417
01:32:54,080 --> 01:32:55,070
And if you do that,

2418
01:32:55,071 --> 01:32:55,811
then you were an artist.

2419
01:32:55,811 --> 01:32:56,481
Feel shatter,

2420
01:32:56,481 --> 01:32:58,400
all sorts of conventions in the post.

2421
01:32:58,550 --> 01:32:58,941
And you know,

2422
01:32:58,941 --> 01:33:01,340
you don't want to just set
out to shatter convention.

2423
01:33:01,370 --> 01:33:02,960
That's like breaking the store window.

2424
01:33:02,961 --> 01:33:04,340
Anybody can do that.

2425
01:33:04,400 --> 01:33:05,180
You want to,

2426
01:33:05,180 --> 01:33:08,300
you want to replace them with
a better set of conventions.

2427
01:33:08,301 --> 01:33:08,600
That's,

2428
01:33:08,600 --> 01:33:10,850
that's the right way of
transcending one's conventions.

2429
01:33:10,851 --> 01:33:12,020
And you can do that if you,

2430
01:33:12,170 --> 01:33:15,290
if you discipline yourself
and to be the true artist.

2431
01:33:15,380 --> 01:33:18,830
Let me tell you some things about
true artists cause it's no joke.

2432
01:33:19,010 --> 01:33:20,360
So here's thing number one.

2433
01:33:21,020 --> 01:33:24,290
So Johann Johann Sebastian Bach,

2434
01:33:25,040 --> 01:33:25,521
first of all,

2435
01:33:25,521 --> 01:33:30,410
there's about five composers that dominate
the classical music world and they

2436
01:33:30,440 --> 01:33:34,430
own these five that's now compared to
all the composers who've ever lived.

2437
01:33:34,910 --> 01:33:39,910
And there their works composable half
the classical repertoire and only a tiny

2438
01:33:41,601 --> 01:33:44,300
proportion of the works
that they wrote our plate.

2439
01:33:44,770 --> 01:33:46,460
And so let's talk about bar,

2440
01:33:46,461 --> 01:33:47,690
cause he's one of the five,

2441
01:33:48,080 --> 01:33:53,080
he wrote so much music that it would
take someone 40 years just to copy it by

2442
01:33:55,521 --> 01:33:57,590
hand if they worked eight hour cases.

2443
01:33:58,520 --> 01:33:58,761
Okay,

2444
01:33:58,761 --> 01:34:00,020
so just think about that.

2445
01:34:00,021 --> 01:34:01,570
Now let's talk about a castle.

2446
01:34:03,240 --> 01:34:05,930
Think how many pieces
of how many paintings,

2447
01:34:05,931 --> 01:34:06,650
sculptures,

2448
01:34:06,650 --> 01:34:09,500
other objects of art
didn't because of produce.

2449
01:34:09,860 --> 01:34:10,041
Well,

2450
01:34:10,041 --> 01:34:10,491
let's see,

2451
01:34:10,491 --> 01:34:14,540
he had a 70 year career,

2452
01:34:15,680 --> 01:34:20,680
65,000 he produced three fully form
pieces of art a day for 65 years every

2453
01:34:27,140 --> 01:34:27,973
single day.

2454
01:34:28,100 --> 01:34:28,933
So it's just an,

2455
01:34:29,130 --> 01:34:31,940
you think about the Cuban
of value of this production,

2456
01:34:31,941 --> 01:34:32,774
it's like,

2457
01:34:32,780 --> 01:34:37,160
it's like the Cuban revalue value
quick and GDP of a decent size country.

2458
01:34:37,520 --> 01:34:38,353
It's absolutely,

2459
01:34:38,540 --> 01:34:38,931
really,

2460
01:34:38,931 --> 01:34:40,760
it's absolutely phenomenal.

2461
01:34:40,970 --> 01:34:44,480
And so if you want to be an artist
and you've got big shoes to fill,

2462
01:34:44,630 --> 01:34:45,140
you want to,

2463
01:34:45,140 --> 01:34:45,320
it's,

2464
01:34:45,320 --> 01:34:50,320
it's the hardest thing to be and you
have to be unbelievably disciplined at

2465
01:34:51,300 --> 01:34:51,890
attemptive,

2466
01:34:51,890 --> 01:34:55,430
ACC oriented and
exploratory and courageous,

2467
01:34:55,460 --> 01:34:59,750
all of that at sharp on fronts to be
an artist that you won't have to worry

2468
01:34:59,751 --> 01:35:03,440
about the conventions of
political correctness because
those people will be so

2469
01:35:03,441 --> 01:35:06,960
far behind you that you want to
be able to see the bedroom door so

2470
01:35:08,280 --> 01:35:13,280
[inaudible].

2471
01:35:16,470 --> 01:35:20,550
When will the Biblical Series
Lecture Series Continue?

2472
01:35:20,820 --> 01:35:21,990
December

2473
01:35:24,320 --> 01:35:27,720
[inaudible]

2474
01:35:27,890 --> 01:35:28,071
good.

2475
01:35:28,071 --> 01:35:29,010
I did ask you,

2476
01:35:29,011 --> 01:35:31,380
we just rent a small theater in Toronto.

2477
01:35:31,381 --> 01:35:33,780
What I'm going to start doing the,

2478
01:35:34,430 --> 01:35:35,960
the stories of Moses,

2479
01:35:36,330 --> 01:35:40,380
the exodus story is and so forth and
I'm really looking forward to that.

2480
01:35:40,381 --> 01:35:45,381
I have a sneaky suspicion that there isn't
anything more important that I can do

2481
01:35:45,540 --> 01:35:48,000
then to continue with
those biblical lectures,

2482
01:35:48,330 --> 01:35:50,880
but I mean this is good to
go around and talk to people.

2483
01:35:50,910 --> 01:35:52,230
This is a really good thing.

2484
01:35:52,610 --> 01:35:52,940
Great,

2485
01:35:52,940 --> 01:35:53,220
great.

2486
01:35:53,220 --> 01:35:53,800
Now,

2487
01:35:53,800 --> 01:35:56,910
but I think it over any
reasonable amount of time,

2488
01:35:56,970 --> 01:35:57,180
right?

2489
01:35:57,180 --> 01:35:59,280
We have full off to
continue to pursue that.

2490
01:35:59,310 --> 01:36:04,260
Partly because there seems to be a
real demand for it who were new gas.

2491
01:36:05,640 --> 01:36:07,350
So preposterous.

2492
01:36:08,370 --> 01:36:09,121
It's even worse.

2493
01:36:09,121 --> 01:36:11,950
The Jonathan Passion
situation is concerned

2494
01:36:14,070 --> 01:36:16,830
and I learned an unbelievable
amount of doing it.

2495
01:36:16,831 --> 01:36:19,190
So I'm really looking forward
to starting it up again.

2496
01:36:19,220 --> 01:36:22,200
So if the plan right now is
to do that December and so,

2497
01:36:22,450 --> 01:36:23,570
so well,

2498
01:36:23,571 --> 01:36:24,404
so that's,

2499
01:36:24,540 --> 01:36:25,260
that's the answer.

2500
01:36:25,260 --> 01:36:26,130
That question.

2501
01:36:26,580 --> 01:36:31,320
So how can we be sure
that we are not in cold?

2502
01:36:31,440 --> 01:36:32,500
I don't know about you.

2503
01:36:38,840 --> 01:36:39,673
Okay.

2504
01:36:41,070 --> 01:36:42,510
Convince me please.

2505
01:36:43,280 --> 01:36:44,060
No,

2506
01:36:44,060 --> 01:36:44,670
no.

2507
01:36:44,670 --> 01:36:45,503
Like look,

2508
01:36:46,070 --> 01:36:49,410
there are where there are ways
you know that you're in a cold

2509
01:36:51,530 --> 01:36:55,470
call just and just some little system
of belief or something like that.

2510
01:36:55,490 --> 01:36:55,841
Call it.

2511
01:36:55,841 --> 01:36:59,540
Does it called when there
are people who study colts,

2512
01:36:59,560 --> 01:37:00,630
they sorted the assignment.

2513
01:37:00,660 --> 01:37:03,230
Maybe one is a cold leader,

2514
01:37:03,270 --> 01:37:06,000
a chief from your family and friends.

2515
01:37:06,180 --> 01:37:09,720
Because one of the rules of the in a
cold is you don't get to associate with

2516
01:37:09,721 --> 01:37:11,460
anyone who is getting the cold.

2517
01:37:11,730 --> 01:37:12,061
Okay.

2518
01:37:12,061 --> 01:37:16,260
So are you being alienated
from your faculty and ceramics

2519
01:37:18,020 --> 01:37:19,890
or maybe you're giving that to yourself.

2520
01:37:19,920 --> 01:37:20,753
That's your brother.

2521
01:37:22,880 --> 01:37:23,540
So,

2522
01:37:23,540 --> 01:37:25,160
so if you're speaking about,

2523
01:37:25,220 --> 01:37:25,700
you know,

2524
01:37:25,700 --> 01:37:27,170
paying attention to what I've been saying,

2525
01:37:27,171 --> 01:37:30,260
I haven't told you to alienate
yourself from your family and friends.

2526
01:37:30,261 --> 01:37:30,840
I told him,

2527
01:37:30,840 --> 01:37:35,030
you get your bloody act together so that
you're good for your family and your

2528
01:37:35,031 --> 01:37:35,391
friends.

2529
01:37:35,391 --> 01:37:37,080
That's like the opposite of a call.

2530
01:37:37,910 --> 01:37:42,910
[inaudible] the

2531
01:37:45,430 --> 01:37:49,240
next thing is the coal of Coleen
and takes all your time and money.

2532
01:37:50,590 --> 01:37:55,590
I haven't taken all your money and I have
taken all your time with three primary

2533
01:37:56,371 --> 01:37:59,570
dimensions of call time batting zero.

2534
01:37:59,910 --> 01:38:00,743
So,

2535
01:38:01,160 --> 01:38:01,620
so,

2536
01:38:01,620 --> 01:38:02,470
so it's,

2537
01:38:02,730 --> 01:38:03,950
it's ridiculous.

2538
01:38:03,970 --> 01:38:05,240
It's a ridiculous,

2539
01:38:05,540 --> 01:38:10,540
I mean understand the comparison because
obviously there's something about this

2540
01:38:10,741 --> 01:38:15,690
set of ideas that has a
compounding nature of some manner.

2541
01:38:15,720 --> 01:38:19,020
You have every reason to be
skeptical and Leery of that.

2542
01:38:19,110 --> 01:38:19,280
You know,

2543
01:38:19,280 --> 01:38:22,470
when I tell my students at the beginning
of point maps or maybe quarters that

2544
01:38:22,471 --> 01:38:26,730
they should do everything they possibly
can to fight everything they possibly

2545
01:38:26,731 --> 01:38:28,260
can wrong about what I tell him,

2546
01:38:28,560 --> 01:38:29,750
that's their job.

2547
01:38:30,360 --> 01:38:31,193
So listen,

2548
01:38:35,990 --> 01:38:36,471
tell me,

2549
01:38:36,471 --> 01:38:37,490
because if it's wrong,

2550
01:38:37,491 --> 01:38:38,390
I'd like to fix it.

2551
01:38:38,530 --> 01:38:39,363
And so,

2552
01:38:39,920 --> 01:38:43,580
so I don't think that
a call can be built on,

2553
01:38:43,850 --> 01:38:44,683
um,

2554
01:38:44,690 --> 01:38:48,110
a message of fundamental
individual responsibility.

2555
01:38:48,560 --> 01:38:49,393
I think that's it.

2556
01:38:52,530 --> 01:38:54,600
You think it's a bit cold of individuals?

2557
01:38:54,970 --> 01:38:55,803
Well,

2558
01:38:58,760 --> 01:39:01,460
so it's good that you're skeptical.

2559
01:39:01,461 --> 01:39:03,620
It's good that you're
asking that question but,

2560
01:39:03,870 --> 01:39:05,530
but the code comparison isn't,

2561
01:39:05,780 --> 01:39:10,130
is the good one because what for the
reasons I just said the course does it as

2562
01:39:10,131 --> 01:39:10,730
well.

2563
01:39:10,730 --> 01:39:14,720
Is there reason to be skeptical of
the ideas that are putting forth?

2564
01:39:14,721 --> 01:39:15,291
And I would say,

2565
01:39:15,291 --> 01:39:16,310
well of course there is.

2566
01:39:16,311 --> 01:39:17,051
You should be scared.

2567
01:39:17,051 --> 01:39:18,020
People have ideas.

2568
01:39:18,350 --> 01:39:22,940
But I would also say you should give some
consideration for the fact that these

2569
01:39:22,941 --> 01:39:25,160
aren't precise and it's by ideas.

2570
01:39:25,161 --> 01:39:25,371
You know,

2571
01:39:25,371 --> 01:39:30,371
what I be trying to do is aggregate a set
of great ideas that [inaudible] that'd

2572
01:39:30,980 --> 01:39:31,640
be,

2573
01:39:31,640 --> 01:39:32,450
what would it be?

2574
01:39:32,450 --> 01:39:34,440
They'd been handed down historically.

2575
01:39:34,470 --> 01:39:34,941
Some of them,

2576
01:39:34,941 --> 01:39:38,690
it'll be discovered scientific again
to try to present those in a compelling

2577
01:39:38,691 --> 01:39:41,000
form to put old wine in new bottles,

2578
01:39:41,001 --> 01:39:41,834
let's say.

2579
01:39:42,240 --> 01:39:45,810
But you of course you want to be
skeptical about that at watchful time.

2580
01:39:46,310 --> 01:39:47,143
We,

2581
01:39:48,370 --> 01:39:51,640
but that doesn't mean that it's a colt
and it doesn't mean necessarily that

2582
01:39:51,641 --> 01:39:53,020
there's any intrinsic page.

2583
01:39:53,500 --> 01:39:56,620
I guess the other thing that you want
to figure out is they say part of their

2584
01:39:56,621 --> 01:39:57,071
fruits,

2585
01:39:57,071 --> 01:40:01,150
you shall know that that's the statement
in the New Testament is like if you've

2586
01:40:01,151 --> 01:40:05,310
been listening to these lectures and
you keep putting the principles into

2587
01:40:05,320 --> 01:40:05,891
practice,

2588
01:40:05,891 --> 01:40:09,450
you can develop a vision for your own
life and taking more responsibility and

2589
01:40:09,451 --> 01:40:10,360
trying to tell the truth.

2590
01:40:10,690 --> 01:40:12,940
What's the consequence of that?

2591
01:40:13,510 --> 01:40:15,840
Like when people talk to me all the time,

2592
01:40:15,850 --> 01:40:16,171
he said,

2593
01:40:16,171 --> 01:40:17,500
what things are better for me?

2594
01:40:17,501 --> 01:40:17,891
It's like,

2595
01:40:17,891 --> 01:40:19,990
well good if they're better for you.

2596
01:40:20,050 --> 01:40:21,540
Maybe they're a for you and your staff,

2597
01:40:21,620 --> 01:40:24,580
the better for you and the people
you have intimate relationships with.

2598
01:40:24,581 --> 01:40:25,414
It's like,

2599
01:40:25,510 --> 01:40:26,291
that's good,

2600
01:40:26,291 --> 01:40:27,430
that's good.

2601
01:40:27,520 --> 01:40:30,380
That's a good diagnostic
diagnostic indicator.

2602
01:40:30,580 --> 01:40:34,510
If you try out the ideas
and they make things better,

2603
01:40:34,570 --> 01:40:39,570
then well that seems to be good piece of
evidence and that's what I would watch

2604
01:40:39,761 --> 01:40:42,670
for and you could make up your own mind.

2605
01:40:42,910 --> 01:40:44,680
Stay skeptical whether you're doing it.

2606
01:40:45,190 --> 01:40:46,023
So,

2607
01:40:47,700 --> 01:40:48,533
okay,

2608
01:40:52,500 --> 01:40:52,801
why are you,

2609
01:40:52,801 --> 01:40:53,970
does message maybe

2610
01:40:53,980 --> 01:40:55,540
resonate with white people?

2611
01:40:57,490 --> 01:40:57,980
Okay.

2612
01:40:57,980 --> 01:41:00,920
There's no evidence for that so well,

2613
01:41:01,140 --> 01:41:04,090
so it's not a question
the answer properly.

2614
01:41:04,380 --> 01:41:05,410
Zachary ticket's gone,

2615
01:41:05,420 --> 01:41:07,170
we'd question that's not posed problem.

2616
01:41:07,530 --> 01:41:09,870
What's your evidence that it does

2617
01:41:11,620 --> 01:41:13,610
to make a question like that,

2618
01:41:13,620 --> 01:41:14,780
which is actually kind of act.

2619
01:41:14,790 --> 01:41:17,540
You say you should get in in short packs.

2620
01:41:17,550 --> 01:41:20,010
Like it's just like what's
your evidence for that?

2621
01:41:20,550 --> 01:41:22,170
So you don't have any evidence then?

2622
01:41:23,430 --> 01:41:27,240
What do you mean mainly exactly cause
we're going to be exactly about this.

2623
01:41:27,241 --> 01:41:29,730
It's like there's probably
a black person out here.

2624
01:41:29,731 --> 01:41:30,401
It's like what are you gonna do?

2625
01:41:30,401 --> 01:41:31,870
Go back.

2626
01:41:34,470 --> 01:41:35,303
Nope,

2627
01:41:35,520 --> 01:41:36,720
that's not a good question.

2628
01:41:37,440 --> 01:41:42,440
[inaudible]

2629
01:41:46,900 --> 01:41:51,010
what do you think is the great risk
threat towards Western society?

2630
01:41:51,760 --> 01:41:54,970
Your unresolved weaknesses of the errors?

2631
01:42:00,490 --> 01:42:01,323
Most

2632
01:42:02,040 --> 01:42:03,300
I need that particular,

2633
01:42:03,360 --> 01:42:07,540
it's like the waste is predicated on the
idea of the divinity of the individual

2634
01:42:07,541 --> 01:42:10,660
and that's mostly associated
with individual responsibility.

2635
01:42:11,020 --> 01:42:14,080
And so to the degree that you
abdicate that responsibility,

2636
01:42:14,081 --> 01:42:14,920
you're the threat.

2637
01:42:15,330 --> 01:42:16,600
It's as simple as that.

2638
01:42:17,900 --> 01:42:22,900
[inaudible]

2639
01:42:24,450 --> 01:42:27,630
is the corner for sustainable long term.

2640
01:42:29,270 --> 01:42:29,870
No,

2641
01:42:29,870 --> 01:42:34,760
I suspect that sometime in the
next 50 years I'm going to die.

2642
01:42:34,890 --> 01:42:35,723
Okay.

2643
01:42:48,860 --> 01:42:51,980
You say it would take you 3.5 more years?

2644
01:42:52,040 --> 01:42:56,450
I don't think it was that precise to
answer the question of Christianity Slash

2645
01:42:56,480 --> 01:42:56,871
God.

2646
01:42:56,871 --> 01:42:58,130
Slash Jesus.

2647
01:42:58,190 --> 01:43:01,340
Is this an honest answer out
of respect or a non answer?

2648
01:43:01,910 --> 01:43:02,743
Well,

2649
01:43:02,800 --> 01:43:03,410
it's,

2650
01:43:03,410 --> 01:43:05,330
it's a vague gas,

2651
01:43:05,360 --> 01:43:06,193
first of all.

2652
01:43:06,450 --> 01:43:07,283
Maybe

2653
01:43:09,230 --> 01:43:14,230
there's lots of things that I have to
prepared myself properly to talk about and

2654
01:43:14,820 --> 01:43:15,250
I'm,

2655
01:43:15,250 --> 01:43:15,801
I'm making,

2656
01:43:15,801 --> 01:43:17,960
making my way through
these biblical lectures.

2657
01:43:17,961 --> 01:43:21,400
I don't know how far I'll get with them
because God only knows what happens in

2658
01:43:21,410 --> 01:43:22,243
lights,

2659
01:43:22,250 --> 01:43:26,600
but I can't answer questions that I
don't want how to answer and so it is an

2660
01:43:26,601 --> 01:43:28,640
honest answer is out of respect.

2661
01:43:29,550 --> 01:43:29,870
No,

2662
01:43:29,870 --> 01:43:32,090
it's sounding great condition perhaps,

2663
01:43:32,091 --> 01:43:34,340
but mostly it's on the
recognition of my homie,

2664
01:43:34,720 --> 01:43:35,320
you know,

2665
01:43:35,320 --> 01:43:37,190
with the things that they
talked to you about tonight.

2666
01:43:37,940 --> 01:43:39,110
I understand.

2667
01:43:39,700 --> 01:43:43,460
I understand that completely because
no one understands anything completely.

2668
01:43:43,790 --> 01:43:45,820
I feel like I'm on solid ground.

2669
01:43:45,850 --> 01:43:48,160
W W with regards to what
I talked to you tonight,

2670
01:43:48,170 --> 01:43:52,880
like I know the literature on perception
well enough to tell you about it and to

2671
01:43:52,881 --> 01:43:56,690
tell you about how that's related
to emotions and motivation and to,

2672
01:43:56,740 --> 01:44:00,410
to lay out the relationship between
value and perception and all of that.

2673
01:44:00,411 --> 01:44:01,670
Because I've done the work,

2674
01:44:01,671 --> 01:44:01,911
you know,

2675
01:44:01,911 --> 01:44:02,990
I've read the papers,

2676
01:44:03,470 --> 01:44:05,390
I've written in the papers for that,

2677
01:44:05,391 --> 01:44:06,050
proud,

2678
01:44:06,050 --> 01:44:08,150
I've done the work and
so I'm on solid ground,

2679
01:44:08,151 --> 01:44:11,300
but there's lots of things
that exceed my capacity.

2680
01:44:11,720 --> 01:44:12,001
You know,

2681
01:44:12,001 --> 01:44:12,430
I'm,

2682
01:44:12,430 --> 01:44:13,070
I,

2683
01:44:13,070 --> 01:44:15,080
I do believe that are,

2684
01:44:15,200 --> 01:44:15,441
you know,

2685
01:44:15,441 --> 01:44:15,691
I,

2686
01:44:15,691 --> 01:44:17,120
I believe that our functional,

2687
01:44:17,121 --> 01:44:21,290
highly functional Western societies are
grounded in the Judeo Christian ethic.

2688
01:44:21,620 --> 01:44:25,220
And then fundamentally that's a religious
effort and that it makes a number of

2689
01:44:25,221 --> 01:44:26,570
metaphysical claims.

2690
01:44:26,840 --> 01:44:30,050
So I have great respect for
the ethic and for the stories,

2691
01:44:30,080 --> 01:44:33,140
but I'm unable to assess
the metaphysical claims.

2692
01:44:33,140 --> 01:44:35,540
And the reason for that is I ate urine.

2693
01:44:35,600 --> 01:44:37,160
I just don't know enough.

2694
01:44:37,520 --> 01:44:41,360
I don't understand the wellhouse way
with regard to the idea of the death and

2695
01:44:41,361 --> 01:44:42,520
resurrection of Christ.

2696
01:44:42,521 --> 01:44:45,710
Like I deemed that
psychologically and symbolically.

2697
01:44:46,070 --> 01:44:50,330
But that doesn't mean that I think that
exhausts the store cause I don't believe

2698
01:44:50,331 --> 01:44:52,220
that my knowledge exhaust the story.

2699
01:44:52,370 --> 01:44:53,001
But I believe,

2700
01:44:53,001 --> 01:44:53,691
for example,

2701
01:44:53,691 --> 01:44:58,610
that the part of you that's capable of
transcending tragedy and malevolence is

2702
01:44:58,611 --> 01:44:59,690
the part that dies.

2703
01:44:59,691 --> 01:45:00,650
It is reborn.

2704
01:45:01,010 --> 01:45:03,530
You have to leave the corrupt
parts of yourself behind.

2705
01:45:03,531 --> 01:45:07,610
You have to let those burn off and
you have to let your spirit be renewed

2706
01:45:07,611 --> 01:45:08,570
continually.

2707
01:45:08,600 --> 01:45:09,860
And that's an ancient story.

2708
01:45:09,861 --> 01:45:13,820
And I think that that has affinity with
the idea of the dying and resurrected.

2709
01:45:13,821 --> 01:45:17,540
See now I don't think
that exhausts the idea,

2710
01:45:17,570 --> 01:45:19,780
but that's as far as I've
been able to push it.

2711
01:45:20,120 --> 01:45:21,650
I mean in my wildest moments,

2712
01:45:21,670 --> 01:45:23,570
and this is speculation,

2713
01:45:23,600 --> 01:45:23,871
right?

2714
01:45:23,871 --> 01:45:24,890
This is speculation.

2715
01:45:24,920 --> 01:45:29,920
I think the idea that Christ died for
our sins and that mankind was redeemed is

2716
01:45:31,101 --> 01:45:32,090
correct,

2717
01:45:32,180 --> 01:45:33,950
but we still have to do the work.

2718
01:45:34,310 --> 01:45:35,750
It's something like that.

2719
01:45:35,830 --> 01:45:39,490
Now that's a benefit statement
and I don't understand the whole,

2720
01:45:39,700 --> 01:45:40,533
right,

2721
01:45:41,420 --> 01:45:41,781
right.

2722
01:45:41,781 --> 01:45:45,950
Because I'm talking about things that
no one can know of in some sense.

2723
01:45:46,130 --> 01:45:49,260
But when I pushed myself up to the
limits of my knowledge and ask,

2724
01:45:49,280 --> 01:45:51,870
that's the sort of
answer that comes to me.

2725
01:45:51,950 --> 01:45:56,090
It's like there is something
about the idea of the,

2726
01:45:56,150 --> 01:45:58,870
of the individual
sacrificing himself for that.

2727
01:45:59,170 --> 01:46:02,120
So we're taking the sins
of mankind to himself.

2728
01:46:02,121 --> 01:46:03,710
There's a written that's real idea.

2729
01:46:03,860 --> 01:46:07,220
I think that that's what people shouldn't
do is that in some senses that you're

2730
01:46:07,221 --> 01:46:10,130
responsible for the
catastrophe of the world.

2731
01:46:10,340 --> 01:46:11,510
I believe that.

2732
01:46:11,570 --> 01:46:16,100
And I also believe that taking
that one the fullest possible way,

2733
01:46:16,101 --> 01:46:18,830
we transform you beyond recognition.

2734
01:46:19,010 --> 01:46:22,370
And I don't know what the ultimate limit
of that is because you could say that

2735
01:46:23,120 --> 01:46:25,670
the story of the death and
resurrection is a living story.

2736
01:46:25,671 --> 01:46:27,200
Like the story of the crucifixion.

2737
01:46:27,230 --> 01:46:32,180
The crucifixion is suffering that can't
be exceeded in some sense because it's

2738
01:46:32,181 --> 01:46:35,330
the most possible suffering for
the most innocent possible person.

2739
01:46:35,540 --> 01:46:37,040
So that's the perfect tragedy,

2740
01:46:37,520 --> 01:46:38,353
right?

2741
01:46:38,390 --> 01:46:40,820
And so there's an idea
that whenever Christ is,

2742
01:46:40,821 --> 01:46:43,970
is that which takes on the tragedy
of the world in that which confronts

2743
01:46:43,971 --> 01:46:45,410
malevolence and overcomes it.

2744
01:46:45,740 --> 01:46:46,230
And I I,

2745
01:46:46,230 --> 01:46:47,440
that's the story of Christ.

2746
01:46:47,490 --> 01:46:47,990
The dessert,

2747
01:46:47,990 --> 01:46:48,630
for example,

2748
01:46:48,630 --> 01:46:49,830
the account per se,

2749
01:46:50,760 --> 01:46:54,780
and the story that Risa fiction is the
willingness to bear that catastrophe of

2750
01:46:54,781 --> 01:46:56,190
existence voluntary.

2751
01:46:56,610 --> 01:47:01,110
And there's an idea that doing that
produces a kind of transfiguration.

2752
01:47:01,140 --> 01:47:02,940
And I think that that's all true,

2753
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:07,710
but I don't know what the limits of that
truth are and sort of pushing it as far

2754
01:47:07,711 --> 01:47:10,190
as I possibly can within
that domain acquired them.

2755
01:47:10,191 --> 01:47:11,080
It didn't understand me,

2756
01:47:11,081 --> 01:47:12,630
but I can't push it past that.

2757
01:47:12,631 --> 01:47:17,631
And so I know I have 300 books stacked
up at home that I need to read.

2758
01:47:17,821 --> 01:47:18,031
You know,

2759
01:47:18,031 --> 01:47:23,031
the people that be sending me to get
through this more deeply than I have been

2760
01:47:23,191 --> 01:47:24,570
able to get through it so far.

2761
01:47:24,571 --> 01:47:26,010
It's so it's,

2762
01:47:26,040 --> 01:47:30,150
it's recognition of my ignorance and
it's respect for the complexity of the

2763
01:47:30,151 --> 01:47:30,900
problem.

2764
01:47:30,900 --> 01:47:31,740
And I said,

2765
01:47:31,741 --> 01:47:31,981
well,

2766
01:47:31,981 --> 01:47:32,640
three,

2767
01:47:32,640 --> 01:47:34,140
three years or four years,

2768
01:47:34,141 --> 01:47:37,490
that was just an estimate based on how
quickly I'd be going through the paper

2769
01:47:37,491 --> 01:47:38,131
called stories.

2770
01:47:38,131 --> 01:47:42,150
But God only knows if I get any deeper
into it than I've already been able to

2771
01:47:42,151 --> 01:47:42,984
find out.

2772
01:47:43,170 --> 01:47:45,060
So that's my answer I guess.

2773
01:47:52,190 --> 01:47:52,401
Oh,

2774
01:47:52,401 --> 01:47:52,611
good.

2775
01:47:52,611 --> 01:47:56,960
A behavioral therapy seems to be the
most widely implemented theoretical

2776
01:47:56,961 --> 01:48:00,620
orientation in our practice
and clinical practice.

2777
01:48:00,621 --> 01:48:03,560
What's your primary modality
in therapy with clients?

2778
01:48:03,740 --> 01:48:05,810
I behaviors you get with,

2779
01:48:05,950 --> 01:48:08,020
because I look for simple solutions.

2780
01:48:08,050 --> 01:48:08,883
It's like,

2781
01:48:08,990 --> 01:48:09,261
well,

2782
01:48:09,261 --> 01:48:10,094
let's see,

2783
01:48:10,730 --> 01:48:13,520
before we get old
psychoanalytic on people let me,

2784
01:48:13,550 --> 01:48:14,000
he wanted,

2785
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:16,490
he wanted to save that
and the union stuff for,

2786
01:48:16,510 --> 01:48:19,220
for exceptional circumstances
as far as I'm concerned.

2787
01:48:19,730 --> 01:48:21,230
If a client comes to me,

2788
01:48:21,470 --> 01:48:21,890
you know,

2789
01:48:21,890 --> 01:48:22,970
here's the situation.

2790
01:48:23,180 --> 01:48:25,870
Someone comes to me and uh,

2791
01:48:26,450 --> 01:48:29,510
it's because their life is going
the way that it needs to go.

2792
01:48:29,750 --> 01:48:31,160
Otherwise they would be there.

2793
01:48:31,740 --> 01:48:35,780
And so I think walnuts
decompose the problem.

2794
01:48:36,890 --> 01:48:37,461
Why are you,

2795
01:48:37,461 --> 01:48:37,970
what happened?

2796
01:48:37,970 --> 01:48:38,340
What,

2797
01:48:38,340 --> 01:48:38,851
what?

2798
01:48:38,851 --> 01:48:41,150
What does your unhappiness system?

2799
01:48:41,780 --> 01:48:43,970
So that would take a lot of conversation.

2800
01:48:43,971 --> 01:48:45,110
That's the diagnosis.

2801
01:48:45,111 --> 01:48:45,501
It's like,

2802
01:48:45,501 --> 01:48:46,334
well,

2803
01:48:47,110 --> 01:48:48,100
do you have a good friends?

2804
01:48:48,110 --> 01:48:49,270
How are you doing with your family?

2805
01:48:49,290 --> 01:48:50,450
How's your career going?

2806
01:48:52,320 --> 01:48:56,420
Are you are attended to your education
or you attended to your mental and

2807
01:48:56,421 --> 01:48:57,254
physical health?

2808
01:48:57,530 --> 01:49:01,700
Do you have a productive and useful
use for your time outside of work?

2809
01:49:01,740 --> 01:49:05,930
And Are you swamped quite temptations
like drug and alcohol use or sexual

2810
01:49:05,931 --> 01:49:06,764
misbehavior?

2811
01:49:06,980 --> 01:49:08,330
It's good way of deconstructing.

2812
01:49:08,390 --> 01:49:10,460
It's like how are you doing
on all those dimensions?

2813
01:49:10,730 --> 01:49:12,680
If you do mind future authoring program,

2814
01:49:12,681 --> 01:49:13,220
by the way,

2815
01:49:13,220 --> 01:49:14,450
which is part of this so far,

2816
01:49:14,451 --> 01:49:15,284
three suite,

2817
01:49:15,540 --> 01:49:17,630
then it will ask you all locals questions.

2818
01:49:17,780 --> 01:49:19,340
And so if you want to do it,

2819
01:49:19,430 --> 01:49:21,350
I made a discount for all of you.

2820
01:49:21,440 --> 01:49:22,520
He could use a cold call,

2821
01:49:22,560 --> 01:49:26,720
12 rules that would knock the
price down by 50% just so you know.

2822
01:49:26,990 --> 01:49:28,010
But we tried to,

2823
01:49:28,400 --> 01:49:32,450
I tried to put the essence
of useful behavioral clinic,

2824
01:49:32,550 --> 01:49:34,680
Ricardo Behavioral Technical Practices to,

2825
01:49:34,970 --> 01:49:35,181
you know,

2826
01:49:35,181 --> 01:49:37,420
an exercise that people
can do on the wrong.

2827
01:49:37,970 --> 01:49:42,970
So I want to find out exactly what is
your problem as far as your concern.

2828
01:49:44,330 --> 01:49:48,130
And then when we want to be respectful
at the simplest possible solutions.

2829
01:49:48,910 --> 01:49:51,310
And so I start from the bar.

2830
01:49:51,340 --> 01:49:52,780
Simple solutions,

2831
01:49:52,840 --> 01:49:53,340
right?

2832
01:49:53,340 --> 01:49:54,173
So like,

2833
01:49:54,400 --> 01:49:54,590
oh,

2834
01:49:54,590 --> 01:49:57,430
maybe you badly only shape physically
and that's contributing to your

2835
01:49:57,431 --> 01:49:58,010
compression.

2836
01:49:58,010 --> 01:49:58,360
So,

2837
01:49:58,360 --> 01:49:59,193
okay,

2838
01:49:59,200 --> 01:50:00,850
how much exercise do you do?

2839
01:50:01,290 --> 01:50:02,740
I'll get you to track that for a week.

2840
01:50:02,741 --> 01:50:03,700
Don't change anything.

2841
01:50:03,701 --> 01:50:05,710
Just to see how much walking you do.

2842
01:50:06,050 --> 01:50:06,511
So I call,

2843
01:50:06,511 --> 01:50:08,950
I have walked like half a mile this week.

2844
01:50:08,951 --> 01:50:09,281
It's like,

2845
01:50:09,281 --> 01:50:09,581
okay,

2846
01:50:09,581 --> 01:50:10,660
well how about next week?

2847
01:50:10,661 --> 01:50:13,420
You try walking six tenths of a mile,

2848
01:50:13,830 --> 01:50:14,170
right?

2849
01:50:14,170 --> 01:50:15,040
Incremental,

2850
01:50:15,041 --> 01:50:15,671
small,

2851
01:50:15,671 --> 01:50:17,380
incremental behavioral groups.

2852
01:50:17,800 --> 01:50:21,340
It's a very straightforward way to help
people and it's a pretty useful way and

2853
01:50:21,341 --> 01:50:23,220
you should try the simplest possible way.

2854
01:50:23,221 --> 01:50:25,240
And that's why I like
the behavioral approach.

2855
01:50:25,630 --> 01:50:26,710
Now I have clients,

2856
01:50:26,711 --> 01:50:28,090
usually the ones who are creative,

2857
01:50:28,091 --> 01:50:33,091
who also benefit tremendously from UV
and approach more symbolic approach.

2858
01:50:33,491 --> 01:50:37,470
They are often people dream a tremendous
and who are creative in their,

2859
01:50:37,480 --> 01:50:42,480
from their essence and our use that
when it's appropriate and necessary.

2860
01:50:43,121 --> 01:50:43,954
But that's,

2861
01:50:44,190 --> 01:50:45,160
that's rare.

2862
01:50:45,450 --> 01:50:47,500
So this is very noisy,

2863
01:50:47,501 --> 01:50:48,334
this thing.

2864
01:50:49,900 --> 01:50:51,160
So like me,

2865
01:50:51,161 --> 01:50:51,994
I guess.

2866
01:50:52,180 --> 01:50:52,960
So,

2867
01:50:52,960 --> 01:50:53,793
um,

2868
01:50:55,840 --> 01:50:56,650
let's see.

2869
01:50:56,650 --> 01:50:56,831
Uh,

2870
01:50:56,831 --> 01:51:00,400
now this could be the loudest one
because I have to stop at some point.

2871
01:51:00,610 --> 01:51:01,443
Um,

2872
01:51:01,870 --> 01:51:04,600
do you have any advice for
students studying psychology?

2873
01:51:05,380 --> 01:51:06,213
Yes.

2874
01:51:06,460 --> 01:51:07,390
Go to my website.

2875
01:51:07,970 --> 01:51:08,803
Yeah.

2876
01:51:10,420 --> 01:51:15,420
Reading list there of the best books
that I've found in my studies as a

2877
01:51:15,781 --> 01:51:16,501
psychologist,

2878
01:51:16,501 --> 01:51:17,700
there's about 20 of them.

2879
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:22,540
Go read those books and that'll
put you head and shoulders ahead.

2880
01:51:23,940 --> 01:51:28,940
There's a lot of them are logs because
psychologists pressure the animals.

2881
01:51:29,250 --> 01:51:32,520
Experimental psychologists at the
neuroscience is a great strides and

2882
01:51:32,521 --> 01:51:34,590
understanding the way the brain works.

2883
01:51:34,591 --> 01:51:36,520
He really need to know
about that cause it's,

2884
01:51:36,521 --> 01:51:39,200
it's profound and interesting
and relevant to net.

2885
01:51:39,360 --> 01:51:41,790
There's a list of books written
by the great clinicians.

2886
01:51:41,830 --> 01:51:43,740
I think they're
unbelievably useful as well.

2887
01:51:43,741 --> 01:51:48,270
So we'll read all those books that if
you want to understand the psychology

2888
01:51:48,280 --> 01:51:49,113
that'll read that.

2889
01:51:49,560 --> 01:51:50,393
Yay.

2890
01:51:50,730 --> 01:51:52,440
So this one,

2891
01:51:52,550 --> 01:51:53,040
that's it.

2892
01:51:53,040 --> 01:51:53,873
Dr. Peterson,

2893
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:55,890
what do you do to relax
and have a good time?

2894
01:51:55,950 --> 01:51:58,050
I come here to answer
questions from the audience.

2895
01:51:58,160 --> 01:52:03,160
[inaudible]

2896
01:52:47,820 --> 01:52:48,653
is he

2897
01:52:50,530 --> 01:52:51,363
your

2898
01:52:56,650 --> 01:52:58,980
cat litter?

2899
01:53:00,460 --> 01:53:03,020
Reforming cycling is

2900
01:53:04,940 --> 01:53:05,571
gentleman Jack,

2901
01:53:05,571 --> 01:53:06,404
when you were

2902
01:53:08,170 --> 01:53:13,170
asking me like mine in how
people get back on the world.

2903
01:53:13,550 --> 01:53:14,383
Well,

2904
01:53:15,010 --> 01:53:16,250
technical last from that,

2905
01:53:16,310 --> 01:53:17,143
which is,

2906
01:53:17,720 --> 01:53:21,530
you know I learned this
from reading 30 years ago.

2907
01:53:21,800 --> 01:53:25,390
You wrote this essay called placed between
the ego and the unconscious through

2908
01:53:25,440 --> 01:53:26,360
work of genius.

2909
01:53:26,800 --> 01:53:30,900
And hit warns people
who deal with are like,

2910
01:53:33,330 --> 01:53:34,340
what are the things you

2911
01:53:36,980 --> 01:53:40,200
don't confuse the ideas with cell.

2912
01:53:41,490 --> 01:53:41,930
You know,

2913
01:53:41,930 --> 01:53:43,710
like I hated watermelon.

2914
01:53:45,320 --> 01:53:48,370
A lot of it are some of the biological,

2915
01:53:48,440 --> 01:53:52,790
some of them that you have to be
very careful not to cheap credit.

2916
01:53:53,700 --> 01:53:54,270
No,

2917
01:53:54,270 --> 01:53:54,420
I'm,

2918
01:53:54,420 --> 01:53:56,670
fortunately I've been able to step up.

2919
01:53:56,690 --> 01:54:00,260
These things might be articulated
at least what I think could be,

2920
01:54:00,380 --> 01:54:05,210
but the ideas and the
stories vastly predate me.

2921
01:54:05,240 --> 01:54:06,740
They're going to be here a lot longer,

2922
01:54:07,700 --> 01:54:12,700
so it's nice to be able to participate
in and then to maybe help shed some light

2923
01:54:13,671 --> 01:54:14,610
on them I suppose.

2924
01:54:14,750 --> 01:54:19,300
But I'm very careful to
distinguish that from meat.

2925
01:54:19,730 --> 01:54:20,320
So,

2926
01:54:20,320 --> 01:54:21,210
and you need to do that.

2927
01:54:21,280 --> 01:54:23,100
And you say,

2928
01:54:23,130 --> 01:54:24,800
I say board of inflation,

2929
01:54:25,100 --> 01:54:29,870
which would be a kind of narcissistic
ready to be awesome I suppose.

2930
01:54:29,871 --> 01:54:32,120
And it's a very dangerous,

2931
01:54:32,480 --> 01:54:36,920
that's a very dangerous risk when you're
investigating these sorts of things.

2932
01:54:36,921 --> 01:54:40,490
But if you're a property terrified
about the negative consequences,

2933
01:54:42,370 --> 01:54:43,670
worst excesses,

2934
01:54:44,020 --> 01:54:44,853
Michael.

2935
01:54:54,290 --> 01:54:58,610
Well,

2936
01:55:00,320 --> 01:55:01,153
I

2937
01:55:08,030 --> 01:55:08,440
leave.

2938
01:55:08,440 --> 01:55:11,980
It's sort of sort of university
drew in an ethical sense.

2939
01:55:12,890 --> 01:55:13,550
You know he's there.

2940
01:55:13,550 --> 01:55:17,060
That's actually can't tell you exactly why

2941
01:55:21,940 --> 01:55:25,360
I was trying to day life.

2942
01:55:25,430 --> 01:55:27,440
Isn't he adorable?

2943
01:55:27,450 --> 01:55:28,283
Burdensome?

2944
01:55:29,720 --> 01:55:29,871
No,

2945
01:55:29,871 --> 01:55:32,110
because it's beyond
those trained killed us.

2946
01:55:32,640 --> 01:55:33,770
It's beyond us.

2947
01:55:33,830 --> 01:55:34,161
It's like,

2948
01:55:34,161 --> 01:55:35,400
well what do you do?

2949
01:55:35,440 --> 01:55:37,470
The base of the new Boston problems,

2950
01:55:37,760 --> 01:55:42,760
often impossible solution and they lost
the solution leads to voluntary bear.

2951
01:55:43,450 --> 01:55:44,283
That

2952
01:55:46,140 --> 01:55:46,470
group.

2953
01:55:46,470 --> 01:55:51,470
One of the strange thing is I think we
can do that and so I would say at minimum

2954
01:55:52,260 --> 01:55:53,730
psychologically speaking,

2955
01:55:53,731 --> 01:55:55,830
Christ isn't exempt flaw that.

2956
01:55:56,370 --> 01:55:56,581
Right.

2957
01:55:56,581 --> 01:55:58,170
And so something to aim at.

2958
01:55:58,320 --> 01:55:59,153
Of course that's it.

2959
01:55:59,190 --> 01:55:59,590
That's it.

2960
01:55:59,590 --> 01:56:03,960
What see the thing about these ideas too
is you can easily dismiss them because

2961
01:56:04,290 --> 01:56:09,000
it is the case that our culture has a
Judaeo Christian pollination and that

2962
01:56:09,001 --> 01:56:09,870
means something.

2963
01:56:09,871 --> 01:56:10,650
It means,

2964
01:56:10,650 --> 01:56:14,730
it means we all these truths to be
self evident and that's what it means.

2965
01:56:14,730 --> 01:56:19,160
It's the self evidence in that statement
and the self evidence has something to

2966
01:56:19,170 --> 01:56:23,100
do with the fact that you know
in your country and my country,

2967
01:56:23,250 --> 01:56:28,250
the individuals to be of this of
intrinsic value not given by the state and

2968
01:56:28,750 --> 01:56:33,750
weighed about intrinsic value
and worthwhile and I ended up up,

2969
01:56:34,980 --> 01:56:35,240
up,

2970
01:56:35,240 --> 01:56:36,073
up,

2971
01:56:36,180 --> 01:56:40,500
up a fundamental responsibility cause
the weight of the state calls on your

2972
01:56:40,501 --> 01:56:41,334
shoulders.

2973
01:56:42,740 --> 01:56:44,060
Just have terminology.

2974
01:56:44,520 --> 01:56:49,350
Our culture is founded on
seems to be doing pretty well.

2975
01:56:49,560 --> 01:56:52,880
So that's something we can
just dispense the thought.

2976
01:56:54,720 --> 01:56:56,250
There's something to it.

2977
01:56:56,460 --> 01:56:57,293
So,

2978
01:56:58,850 --> 01:56:59,683
well,

2979
01:57:01,870 --> 01:57:02,790
well for me it's,

2980
01:57:02,791 --> 01:57:04,360
I don't feel that I

2981
01:57:10,020 --> 01:57:12,840
pushed myself up to the
limits of what I know.

2982
01:57:13,080 --> 01:57:15,570
And then hopefully I'll
be silent after that.

2983
01:57:15,571 --> 01:57:18,670
And if I learned some more
so that I actually know,

2984
01:57:18,710 --> 01:57:20,640
well maybe I can talk about it,

2985
01:57:20,641 --> 01:57:22,270
but until that time try it out,

2986
01:57:26,340 --> 01:57:27,560
we would actually,

2987
01:57:29,850 --> 01:57:30,250
oh,

2988
01:57:30,250 --> 01:57:31,290
not the answer.

2989
01:57:31,380 --> 01:57:34,410
I think what I've found
with these stores decrease,

2990
01:57:35,370 --> 01:57:36,120
they go,

2991
01:57:36,120 --> 01:57:37,270
there's no wall.

2992
01:57:38,140 --> 01:57:40,040
God knows how complicated picks,

2993
01:57:40,050 --> 01:57:40,883
really odd.

2994
01:57:41,400 --> 01:57:41,670
Tear,

2995
01:57:41,670 --> 01:57:42,503
complicated,

2996
01:57:44,930 --> 01:57:45,763
satisfied,

2997
01:57:46,350 --> 01:57:47,183
satisfaction.

2998
01:57:49,230 --> 01:57:51,690
The satisfaction question,

2999
01:57:52,650 --> 01:57:52,940
you know.

3000
01:57:52,940 --> 01:57:54,540
And I think that's the right answer.

3001
01:57:54,541 --> 01:57:56,190
Just satisfaction questions.

3002
01:57:56,210 --> 01:57:57,110
It's the right gas,

3003
01:57:57,300 --> 01:57:57,610
you know,

3004
01:57:57,610 --> 01:57:58,443
something like that.

3005
01:57:58,830 --> 01:58:01,230
So he'll want to run out
of things to do anyways.

3006
01:58:01,290 --> 01:58:02,123
So

3007
01:58:07,140 --> 01:58:08,240
very rare

3008
01:58:14,740 --> 01:58:15,573
art.

3009
01:58:31,740 --> 01:58:32,573
Yeah.

3010
01:58:40,990 --> 01:58:41,823
Well you never know.

3011
01:58:57,820 --> 01:58:59,710
Whatever possibilities.

3012
01:59:01,740 --> 01:59:06,700
It's certainly be gratifying to go around
from city to city doing these talks.

3013
01:59:09,010 --> 01:59:09,610
And so,

3014
01:59:09,610 --> 01:59:09,831
you know,

3015
01:59:09,831 --> 01:59:11,110
but that's a lovely thing.

3016
01:59:11,190 --> 01:59:12,023
One of the,

3017
01:59:12,130 --> 01:59:14,510
somebody asked him about coffee.

3018
01:59:14,511 --> 01:59:15,344
No,

3019
01:59:17,300 --> 01:59:17,600
no,

3020
01:59:17,600 --> 01:59:20,900
but I can tell you what I experience and

3021
01:59:23,590 --> 01:59:24,940
wherever I go now

3022
01:59:26,460 --> 01:59:27,293
I need

3023
01:59:33,850 --> 01:59:38,850
a touching story telling them just
want extra or something like that.

3024
01:59:39,720 --> 01:59:43,960
We say they tell me something
about that state your life.

3025
01:59:43,961 --> 01:59:45,430
Was He in a disordered state?

3026
01:59:45,440 --> 01:59:46,600
In one form or another?

3027
01:59:46,830 --> 01:59:48,910
Have sometimes severely disordered.

3028
01:59:49,030 --> 01:59:49,331
God,

3029
01:59:49,331 --> 01:59:54,331
I can't tell me the other day it was so
cold and the more I talk for 10 seconds,

3030
01:59:54,580 --> 01:59:57,460
he said year and a half
ago I just got out of jail.

3031
01:59:58,720 --> 01:59:59,920
Now I'm married,

3032
01:59:59,921 --> 02:00:00,760
I have a child.

3033
02:00:00,761 --> 02:00:05,500
I just bought my own apartment
because he was watching my lectures,

3034
02:00:07,730 --> 02:00:12,730
you know and so well so the reason I
broke that up cause you were talking about

3035
02:00:13,180 --> 02:00:14,013
law,

3036
02:00:15,360 --> 02:00:17,540
what's extraordinary gratified.

3037
02:00:17,541 --> 02:00:17,950
Whoa.

3038
02:00:17,950 --> 02:00:18,580
This is,

3039
02:00:18,580 --> 02:00:20,020
there's plenty of that to me.

3040
02:00:20,560 --> 02:00:24,730
So it seems like it's going quite well
and see how you can help out with that

3041
02:00:24,820 --> 02:00:25,570
continued,

3042
02:00:25,570 --> 02:00:26,740
you know my,

3043
02:00:27,160 --> 02:00:31,550
my set more sensible park is expected.

3044
02:00:33,310 --> 02:00:37,270
Just seem too crazy to be sustainable.

3045
02:00:37,300 --> 02:00:38,133
But

3046
02:00:50,900 --> 02:00:51,733
yeah,

3047
02:01:09,070 --> 02:01:10,900
six year old,

3048
02:01:23,520 --> 02:01:25,620
I would say you need to
talk to your partner,

3049
02:01:26,100 --> 02:01:27,690
your disciplinary scrap,

3050
02:01:28,680 --> 02:01:31,860
decide where do you live in is.

3051
02:01:32,190 --> 02:01:34,010
And be honest about that.

3052
02:01:34,150 --> 02:01:38,860
It's costly from what
you've told my suspicions,

3053
02:01:39,500 --> 02:01:40,333
allowing yourself,

3054
02:01:42,900 --> 02:01:43,850
MMM

3055
02:01:44,960 --> 02:01:49,250
[inaudible] wishes.

3056
02:01:49,270 --> 02:01:50,180
You've asked me at this.

3057
02:01:50,680 --> 02:01:53,050
Stop it.

3058
02:01:53,051 --> 02:01:53,884
See what happens.

3059
02:01:54,070 --> 02:01:58,980
My suspicions are liking
[inaudible] attitude.

3060
02:01:59,830 --> 02:02:02,090
You have to have a discussion about that,

3061
02:02:08,800 --> 02:02:10,440
but you're

3062
02:02:13,540 --> 02:02:16,870
getting it in front of
me and good for giving.

3063
02:02:16,871 --> 02:02:21,490
You finally sat and he's a Bush character.

3064
02:02:21,960 --> 02:02:23,040
What that means in part,

3065
02:02:23,090 --> 02:02:27,560
he really well socializing because a kid
like that wants to go where the lines

3066
02:02:27,920 --> 02:02:30,040
like it isn't just tossed.

3067
02:02:31,570 --> 02:02:33,000
The light can be this thick,

3068
02:02:33,040 --> 02:02:33,873
vague,

3069
02:02:34,080 --> 02:02:35,370
her kid like that.

3070
02:02:35,450 --> 02:02:35,880
Oh No,

3071
02:02:35,880 --> 02:02:36,713
no.

3072
02:02:37,320 --> 02:02:41,910
He wants to know where the
lions and the advantage to that.

3073
02:02:41,920 --> 02:02:44,020
If you can show exactly where the line is.

3074
02:02:44,100 --> 02:02:45,010
Perverse behavior,

3075
02:02:45,030 --> 02:02:47,500
keeping him on unbelievably
sophisticated social.

3076
02:02:47,930 --> 02:02:51,170
So that's the advantage in that
kind of emotion is what I would say.

3077
02:02:51,830 --> 02:02:53,470
It also sounds like he's tough enough

3078
02:02:55,810 --> 02:02:56,643
sphere.

3079
02:02:56,930 --> 02:02:58,760
My suspicions are the liking better.

3080
02:02:58,820 --> 02:02:59,631
My son was like,

3081
02:02:59,631 --> 02:03:01,360
that is a tough path.

3082
02:03:01,361 --> 02:03:02,880
Is that right from the right?

3083
02:03:04,010 --> 02:03:06,380
And one of the things that
I experienced was that,

3084
02:03:06,800 --> 02:03:07,301
you know,

3085
02:03:07,301 --> 02:03:12,301
to him and humiliate me and my wife
is Kevin Thompson candies mushed 11,

3086
02:03:13,991 --> 02:03:14,790
10,

3087
02:03:14,790 --> 02:03:15,623
okay.

3088
02:03:16,340 --> 02:03:17,930
For the next three days.

3089
02:03:17,931 --> 02:03:20,910
He gets a movement every time.

3090
02:03:21,530 --> 02:03:25,230
It really shocked because I
wasn't sure if that would happen,

3091
02:03:25,710 --> 02:03:26,810
but you know,

3092
02:03:26,811 --> 02:03:28,070
he's looking for

3093
02:03:30,220 --> 02:03:32,280
solo or

3094
02:03:32,480 --> 02:03:33,313
maybe

3095
02:03:36,680 --> 02:03:39,350
he won't buy being reasonable.

3096
02:03:39,400 --> 02:03:43,160
You just in the very strategies version
will be the real harm even though there

3097
02:03:43,161 --> 02:03:44,680
might be a lot of sparks and the like,

3098
02:03:45,680 --> 02:03:49,330
that's also part of the testing so that

3099
02:03:51,530 --> 02:03:52,363
uh,

3100
02:03:54,730 --> 02:03:55,790
uh,

3101
02:03:57,760 --> 02:03:58,593
or

3102
02:04:03,850 --> 02:04:04,840
no,

3103
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:19,000
you feel me like so many and dealt
with things around you do all

3104
02:04:22,220 --> 02:04:23,220
the mask.

3105
02:04:23,510 --> 02:04:24,650
Most people aren't.

3106
02:04:24,651 --> 02:04:29,651
In that situation I have
had was tangled up Sophie,

3107
02:04:31,590 --> 02:04:36,590
he fixed my thinking and
we fixed one of them.

3108
02:04:48,110 --> 02:04:48,943
You

3109
02:04:52,370 --> 02:04:53,203
wait

3110
02:04:54,380 --> 02:04:55,213
what?

3111
02:04:55,360 --> 02:04:56,250
He's doing

3112
02:04:58,170 --> 02:04:58,430
good.

3113
02:04:58,430 --> 02:05:03,430
It does know there's
Christian Christianity that

3114
02:05:10,270 --> 02:05:12,920
might have a big

3115
02:05:17,900 --> 02:05:18,950
lot of that

3116
02:05:21,720 --> 02:05:22,440
are,

3117
02:05:22,440 --> 02:05:23,540
that doesn't mean it's awesome.

3118
02:05:24,580 --> 02:05:26,030
So I've seen people

3119
02:05:28,060 --> 02:05:30,940
take [inaudible] in your life,

3120
02:05:32,550 --> 02:05:33,383
that's for sure.

3121
02:05:34,120 --> 02:05:34,953
Yeah,

3122
02:05:38,860 --> 02:05:39,680
sure.

3123
02:05:39,680 --> 02:05:40,513
Rolling.

3124
02:05:49,200 --> 02:05:50,033
Yeah,

3125
02:06:05,430 --> 02:06:06,300
it's good.

3126
02:06:06,560 --> 02:06:07,393
The restaurant

3127
02:06:15,300 --> 02:06:20,150
you might want to just speed through
because it was an issue I tried to workout

3128
02:06:20,230 --> 02:06:21,063
in them,

3129
02:06:21,720 --> 02:06:23,590
which is the relationship
between disciplines.

3130
02:06:24,660 --> 02:06:25,370
You know,

3131
02:06:25,370 --> 02:06:26,430
you can think of Moses,

3132
02:06:26,490 --> 02:06:28,440
oh say well if you take one,

3133
02:06:28,441 --> 02:06:31,570
half of those other paths
are those other paths

3134
02:06:33,720 --> 02:06:37,100
and your potential has the
mat step your pants story.

3135
02:06:37,960 --> 02:06:42,960
Peter Pan Wants to stay a kid because
Penn needs every essentially it's so he

3136
02:06:43,111 --> 02:06:46,170
wants to retain the infinite
possibility of child

3137
02:06:47,750 --> 02:06:49,980
but then he ends up king in the lost boys.

3138
02:06:50,500 --> 02:06:51,440
Like he never,

3139
02:06:51,441 --> 02:06:53,630
lamb will never like this exist.

3140
02:06:53,720 --> 02:06:58,720
And who wants to be king was is anyways
cause he sees Kevin Hart capital is a

3141
02:06:59,971 --> 02:07:00,804
tire.

3142
02:07:01,370 --> 02:07:01,641
Right.

3143
02:07:01,641 --> 02:07:03,710
And the reason is the tire
just cause he's terrified.

3144
02:07:03,770 --> 02:07:04,603
Yeah.

3145
02:07:04,640 --> 02:07:05,473
Yeah.

3146
02:07:06,160 --> 02:07:09,750
[inaudible] it's already got a piece.

3147
02:07:10,520 --> 02:07:13,490
So how gets a target is terrified of care,

3148
02:07:13,580 --> 02:07:18,580
lead a panel properly with the CS and
the dollar this year or is keen in lost

3149
02:07:18,890 --> 02:07:20,540
boys and he doesn't get when the either,

3150
02:07:20,960 --> 02:07:21,680
so,

3151
02:07:21,680 --> 02:07:22,040
okay.

3152
02:07:22,040 --> 02:07:23,640
So I'm sure that

3153
02:07:25,220 --> 02:07:26,930
it's okay to make a decision.

3154
02:07:27,430 --> 02:07:27,930
You know,

3155
02:07:27,930 --> 02:07:29,750
you limit yourself.

3156
02:07:29,751 --> 02:07:32,190
But in that limiting also spam yourself.

3157
02:07:32,470 --> 02:07:34,280
Like if you,

3158
02:07:34,550 --> 02:07:35,350
this is what,

3159
02:07:35,350 --> 02:07:40,350
in science you can pick out a
new problem called the school

3160
02:07:46,110 --> 02:07:47,370
and when you start to work on that,

3161
02:07:48,050 --> 02:07:48,940
it expands.

3162
02:07:49,030 --> 02:07:50,710
You get disciplined in the Spanish,

3163
02:07:51,040 --> 02:07:55,840
and so you make some constraints
and the constraints of relationship,

3164
02:07:55,870 --> 02:07:58,260
they become stranger
career and you accept it.

3165
02:07:58,270 --> 02:07:59,500
It was a discipline yourself.

3166
02:07:59,501 --> 02:08:04,180
And the consequences of that is that
that expanse of passing the modeling.

3167
02:08:04,840 --> 02:08:05,673
So

3168
02:08:07,020 --> 02:08:08,710
potential as a child discipline,

3169
02:08:08,711 --> 02:08:10,960
that it's a real system of constraints,

3170
02:08:10,961 --> 02:08:13,880
a sacrifice 12 to sacrifice
all those other potential

3171
02:08:15,400 --> 02:08:16,041
pay off.

3172
02:08:16,041 --> 02:08:17,170
As you discipline yourself,

3173
02:08:17,230 --> 02:08:18,370
you start to expand out.

3174
02:08:18,850 --> 02:08:19,683
So

3175
02:08:21,850 --> 02:08:22,990
the way that I deal with that,

3176
02:08:22,991 --> 02:08:27,991
usually my clinical practices
implemented the best plan you have to,

3177
02:08:28,810 --> 02:08:28,940
well,

3178
02:08:28,940 --> 02:08:30,580
I'm going to wait around
for a better class.

3179
02:08:30,700 --> 02:08:34,240
That's not a good plan because you're
not informing yourself while you're

3180
02:08:34,241 --> 02:08:35,074
waiting around.

3181
02:08:35,270 --> 02:08:36,690
So if you implement a plan,

3182
02:08:36,700 --> 02:08:37,690
it's not a perfect plan.

3183
02:08:37,691 --> 02:08:41,070
At least you'd know why
it's a role specific.

3184
02:08:42,040 --> 02:08:42,641
Exactly.

3185
02:08:42,641 --> 02:08:43,474
What's wrong?

3186
02:08:44,110 --> 02:08:45,090
Damn lab.

3187
02:08:45,370 --> 02:08:45,731
Sorry.

3188
02:08:45,731 --> 02:08:46,564
We'll see.

3189
02:08:47,320 --> 02:08:49,800
You lose a lot less by sacrificing that.

3190
02:08:49,810 --> 02:08:50,880
You think that the game,

3191
02:08:51,850 --> 02:08:55,300
so that's what it looks
like to me moving forward.

3192
02:08:55,301 --> 02:08:55,810
Man.

3193
02:08:55,810 --> 02:08:56,381
That's right.

3194
02:08:56,381 --> 02:08:56,860
Well,

3195
02:08:56,860 --> 02:08:58,030
life's short room.

3196
02:08:58,031 --> 02:08:58,600
Horrible.

3197
02:08:58,600 --> 02:08:59,730
That's the call of adventure.

3198
02:08:59,731 --> 02:09:01,810
And even having stories like you know,

3199
02:09:01,820 --> 02:09:05,530
constantly would those God
calling them to and they do it,

3200
02:09:07,350 --> 02:09:07,870
you know?

3201
02:09:07,870 --> 02:09:10,180
But it's better than
standing where you are.

3202
02:09:10,300 --> 02:09:11,133
Right?

3203
02:09:22,170 --> 02:09:23,700
You rag magnate

3204
02:09:26,390 --> 02:09:27,223
and

3205
02:09:34,780 --> 02:09:36,520
bitter bitterness.

3206
02:09:37,960 --> 02:09:38,793
No,

3207
02:09:39,100 --> 02:09:41,110
just just one of the
ways that you could tell,

3208
02:09:41,770 --> 02:09:42,790
you can tell,

3209
02:09:43,480 --> 02:09:45,160
one of the things that council people do,

3210
02:09:45,161 --> 02:09:48,860
and I talked about this
like is consult you resent,

3211
02:09:49,380 --> 02:09:49,560
hey,

3212
02:09:49,560 --> 02:09:52,310
let's say that he knows
where your resentment like,

3213
02:09:52,510 --> 02:09:53,343
okay,

3214
02:09:54,510 --> 02:09:55,820
why are you present?

3215
02:09:56,720 --> 02:09:57,850
There's only two reasons.

3216
02:09:57,910 --> 02:10:02,910
One is you're used to sit and wine and
you should grow the hell up and accept

3217
02:10:03,451 --> 02:10:05,920
the responsibility hospital possible.

3218
02:10:05,980 --> 02:10:10,980
One possibility number two is you're
taking too much onto yourself without

3219
02:10:12,311 --> 02:10:15,250
sufficient recommends who reward.

3220
02:10:15,370 --> 02:10:17,290
So you're taking advantage of yourself,

3221
02:10:17,291 --> 02:10:18,410
where you're allowing yourself.

3222
02:10:19,500 --> 02:10:21,090
It's one of those too.

3223
02:10:21,280 --> 02:10:21,700
It's like,

3224
02:10:21,700 --> 02:10:21,971
okay,

3225
02:10:21,971 --> 02:10:25,390
so how do you figure out which one
it is all suspect the first one,

3226
02:10:26,200 --> 02:10:26,501
right?

3227
02:10:26,501 --> 02:10:30,880
Because you should always be a little
suspicious in relationship to yourself as

3228
02:10:30,881 --> 02:10:31,920
a little helpful that way.

3229
02:10:31,990 --> 02:10:34,240
And I don't mean
accessing to be skeptical,

3230
02:10:36,740 --> 02:10:37,573
you know,

3231
02:10:37,860 --> 02:10:38,210
trust.

3232
02:10:38,210 --> 02:10:38,691
They might say,

3233
02:10:38,691 --> 02:10:42,590
no one knows I need all your
taken way too much then.

3234
02:10:43,250 --> 02:10:48,250
Then you have to figure out how
you reward yourself for that shit.

3235
02:10:48,401 --> 02:10:51,200
Some of it so that you have,

3236
02:10:53,330 --> 02:10:55,760
because you have to be just to yourself.

3237
02:10:56,330 --> 02:10:56,511
You know,

3238
02:10:56,511 --> 02:10:56,901
I said,

3239
02:10:56,901 --> 02:10:59,270
when did you take on as much
responsibility as you can?

3240
02:10:59,630 --> 02:11:02,850
But that also means as much as pat,

3241
02:11:03,200 --> 02:11:04,670
if you're starting to get presented with,

3242
02:11:04,700 --> 02:11:07,580
that's often an assignment
you've taken on too much,

3243
02:11:08,000 --> 02:11:09,590
grinding yourself into the ground.

3244
02:11:10,030 --> 02:11:12,830
It's a bad strategy from a
sustainability perspective.

3245
02:11:12,831 --> 02:11:15,800
So it's all your present and see,

3246
02:11:16,070 --> 02:11:17,720
because you want to be able to iterate.

3247
02:11:17,721 --> 02:11:20,940
If you want to be able to maintain
the burden across time and resentment,

3248
02:11:20,950 --> 02:11:23,220
the assignment or that
you've taken on such a level,

3249
02:11:23,250 --> 02:11:24,083
you can't do that.

3250
02:11:25,530 --> 02:11:28,390
That's a partial answer to that.

3251
02:11:51,480 --> 02:11:53,850
So what you're saying,

3252
02:11:56,970 --> 02:11:57,803
monogamy,

3253
02:12:00,510 --> 02:12:02,060
I mean,

3254
02:12:02,200 --> 02:12:03,070
if you're gonna,

3255
02:12:03,140 --> 02:12:05,500
if you're going to accuse
someone of something,

3256
02:12:05,530 --> 02:12:06,730
you shouldn't use the book.

3257
02:12:06,731 --> 02:12:08,890
Something that someone was somewhere,

3258
02:12:08,891 --> 02:12:10,340
I bet if we believe

3259
02:12:12,390 --> 02:12:15,190
that the state should
intervene and distributed

3260
02:12:15,860 --> 02:12:20,860
well [inaudible] recruiters,

3261
02:12:33,380 --> 02:12:34,213
no.

3262
02:12:37,020 --> 02:12:37,853
Okay.

3263
02:12:46,550 --> 02:12:48,230
All sorts of immediately.

3264
02:12:48,290 --> 02:12:49,670
Cause I do a lot of media here.

3265
02:12:49,760 --> 02:12:50,970
But no,

3266
02:12:50,971 --> 02:12:53,030
I've never heard from Chenin four again.

3267
02:12:53,180 --> 02:12:55,300
But I didn't reach out to her after that.

3268
02:12:55,940 --> 02:12:58,550
After the first week.

3269
02:12:59,010 --> 02:13:01,000
Right through it.

3270
02:13:01,050 --> 02:13:02,100
It's a media look,

3271
02:13:02,300 --> 02:13:04,030
why don't we actually do this gifts.

3272
02:13:04,031 --> 02:13:05,630
It could actually have a conversation.

3273
02:13:05,810 --> 02:13:06,710
And she said,

3274
02:13:07,370 --> 02:13:11,730
well I'll think I'll wait until it
dies down to this trouble those down

3275
02:13:13,640 --> 02:13:17,420
[inaudible] it was a funny situation.

3276
02:13:18,660 --> 02:13:19,300
No,

3277
02:13:19,300 --> 02:13:20,133
I

3278
02:13:21,210 --> 02:13:23,500
haven't lost the big chop it up.

3279
02:13:24,030 --> 02:13:24,863
Five minutes.

3280
02:13:25,340 --> 02:13:27,130
Three Boston could like NBC,

3281
02:13:27,580 --> 02:13:28,390
NBC,

3282
02:13:28,390 --> 02:13:29,040
worst job,

3283
02:13:29,040 --> 02:13:29,830
anyone.

3284
02:13:29,830 --> 02:13:30,990
That was my calling.

3285
02:13:31,350 --> 02:13:32,183
It was so,

3286
02:13:32,430 --> 02:13:34,200
it wasn't even so much that it was,

3287
02:13:35,700 --> 02:13:36,533
although

3288
02:13:38,040 --> 02:13:40,300
it was so amateurish.

3289
02:13:41,120 --> 02:13:41,980
Okay.

3290
02:13:41,990 --> 02:13:43,310
It's not malicious,

3291
02:13:43,320 --> 02:13:44,640
but it would be stupid.

3292
02:13:44,700 --> 02:13:48,960
That's a really bad combination
because they put up the edit version,

3293
02:13:49,570 --> 02:13:51,330
I mean whatever the action of video.

3294
02:13:51,580 --> 02:13:53,580
And so then people on Youtube just said,

3295
02:13:53,581 --> 02:13:54,414
well

3296
02:13:57,720 --> 02:13:59,250
I expected more from,

3297
02:13:59,340 --> 02:14:00,070
you know,

3298
02:14:00,070 --> 02:14:00,903
and so.

3299
02:14:01,060 --> 02:14:02,910
So anyways,

3300
02:14:02,911 --> 02:14:04,060
I haven't heard back from,

3301
02:14:05,350 --> 02:14:06,600
and I don't really expect.

3302
02:14:07,670 --> 02:14:12,280
So I think it's the city
for enforcement order

3303
02:14:17,930 --> 02:14:19,490
this understanding that that annoys me.

3304
02:14:19,510 --> 02:14:20,343
Most days I,

3305
02:14:20,450 --> 02:14:25,060
he's been accused of a baby
to what you post modernism,

3306
02:14:25,160 --> 02:14:28,320
new marks that the Sukkot philosophers

3307
02:14:29,860 --> 02:14:33,870
know that postmodernism is skeptical
and Ben and narratives admins,

3308
02:14:33,900 --> 02:14:35,760
it's not commensurate Marxism.

3309
02:14:35,761 --> 02:14:36,360
It's like,

3310
02:14:36,360 --> 02:14:36,691
yeah,

3311
02:14:36,691 --> 02:14:39,810
I know that in that the blood post
modernists is having to seek a particular,

3312
02:14:39,980 --> 02:14:40,813
now

3313
02:14:42,490 --> 02:14:43,820
it's like they're,

3314
02:14:43,860 --> 02:14:48,860
they're using the ignorance
on a philosophical topic
with the actual situation

3315
02:14:49,111 --> 02:14:49,381
is,

3316
02:14:49,381 --> 02:14:54,160
is that just might the fact that
those doctrines are not commensurate,

3317
02:14:54,230 --> 02:14:55,950
they're juxtaposed constantly.

3318
02:14:56,540 --> 02:14:58,340
That's how my misunderstanding,

3319
02:14:58,460 --> 02:15:01,910
that's the confusion of the people
in the aggregate in academia.

3320
02:15:01,980 --> 02:15:03,560
So that's the most annoying.

3321
02:15:03,840 --> 02:15:04,770
So it's,

3322
02:15:04,771 --> 02:15:05,750
and it's not that,

3323
02:15:06,090 --> 02:15:07,010
so

3324
02:15:10,590 --> 02:15:15,590
[inaudible] is unbelievably unworn
cause he knew nothing about them.

3325
02:15:24,841 --> 02:15:27,090
So it was just cash
shooting off his mouth.

3326
02:15:27,420 --> 02:15:27,661
You know,

3327
02:15:27,661 --> 02:15:27,871
like,

3328
02:15:27,871 --> 02:15:28,704
I

3329
02:15:30,270 --> 02:15:35,270
mean I have plenty of experience
with so called minority communities.

3330
02:15:36,001 --> 02:15:40,890
Like I get to use that terminology
or minorities or communities,

3331
02:15:40,891 --> 02:15:41,671
but you know,

3332
02:15:41,671 --> 02:15:44,330
he doesn't know a damn thing
about what I know about,

3333
02:15:44,540 --> 02:15:48,450
about people who've already now
and then just assess the situation.

3334
02:15:48,600 --> 02:15:49,350
So,

3335
02:15:49,350 --> 02:15:50,130
you know,

3336
02:15:50,130 --> 02:15:50,790
it was,

3337
02:15:50,790 --> 02:15:51,810
he was very,

3338
02:15:54,230 --> 02:15:57,150
he had a pretty decent rhetorical kissed.

3339
02:15:58,110 --> 02:16:02,250
He could be charismatic
and a good sense of humor,

3340
02:16:02,490 --> 02:16:05,340
but a lot of cheap shots.

3341
02:16:09,540 --> 02:16:12,390
Like when I pushed him
on white privilege thing,

3342
02:16:12,420 --> 02:16:12,691
it's like,

3343
02:16:12,691 --> 02:16:13,111
all right,

3344
02:16:13,111 --> 02:16:13,770
fine ma'am,

3345
02:16:13,770 --> 02:16:16,280
if I net terms all he did was accurate.

3346
02:16:16,290 --> 02:16:16,720
That was,

3347
02:16:16,720 --> 02:16:17,520
uh,

3348
02:16:17,520 --> 02:16:18,353
an assault.

3349
02:16:18,360 --> 02:16:18,541
Like,

3350
02:16:18,541 --> 02:16:19,374
no,

3351
02:16:19,380 --> 02:16:20,670
it's not an assault.

3352
02:16:20,850 --> 02:16:22,680
We specify your damn returns,

3353
02:16:22,860 --> 02:16:23,221
all that,

3354
02:16:23,221 --> 02:16:24,980
it was a main become irritating.

3355
02:16:25,050 --> 02:16:25,381
It's like,

3356
02:16:25,381 --> 02:16:25,591
yeah,

3357
02:16:25,591 --> 02:16:26,430
it made me think.

3358
02:16:26,431 --> 02:16:27,340
And now you're irritating.

3359
02:16:34,060 --> 02:16:34,893
Yeah.

3360
02:16:56,900 --> 02:16:57,733
Yeah.

3361
02:17:08,560 --> 02:17:09,060
So,

3362
02:17:09,060 --> 02:17:13,080
and there's all sorts of
schools of philosophy,

3363
02:17:14,620 --> 02:17:17,540
physics as well that our unbelievably,

3364
02:17:17,541 --> 02:17:18,374
he can just,

3365
02:17:20,030 --> 02:17:21,460
it's very,

3366
02:17:21,461 --> 02:17:21,791
very,

3367
02:17:21,791 --> 02:17:22,750
very complicated.

3368
02:17:23,130 --> 02:17:25,970
And it's not a matter of truth.

3369
02:17:29,140 --> 02:17:31,700
Here's the truth is
associated with how you act.

3370
02:17:32,240 --> 02:17:32,830
There's a truth.

3371
02:17:32,830 --> 02:17:35,070
It's associated with what the world's is.

3372
02:17:39,490 --> 02:17:40,323
No one knows how

3373
02:17:44,000 --> 02:17:44,850
the cake is.

3374
02:17:45,030 --> 02:17:45,980
Katherine's identified.

3375
02:17:46,980 --> 02:17:47,641
These are very,

3376
02:17:47,641 --> 02:17:49,700
very complicated for all known.

3377
02:17:49,750 --> 02:17:51,110
If they seem self evident,

3378
02:17:51,190 --> 02:17:54,220
the only reason they seem self
evident as you the dark one.

3379
02:17:55,880 --> 02:17:57,220
And that's what you know,

3380
02:17:57,250 --> 02:17:58,570
and it seems self evident.

3381
02:17:58,710 --> 02:18:01,070
There's like 30 of them and they fight,

3382
02:18:01,330 --> 02:18:02,470
they fight like half,

3383
02:18:02,930 --> 02:18:03,763
so

3384
02:18:08,880 --> 02:18:09,713
yeah.

3385
02:18:10,000 --> 02:18:10,833
Hmm.

3386
02:18:11,930 --> 02:18:12,763
Yeah.

3387
02:18:15,980 --> 02:18:16,813
Uh,

3388
02:18:22,360 --> 02:18:22,931
well,

3389
02:18:22,931 --> 02:18:23,201
so,

3390
02:18:23,201 --> 02:18:23,681
so you know,

3391
02:18:23,681 --> 02:18:26,630
you said when you deconverted
that you went through your,

3392
02:18:27,600 --> 02:18:31,750
part of the reason for that is that
materialist atheism doesn't produce an

3393
02:18:31,751 --> 02:18:32,584
ethic.

3394
02:18:32,980 --> 02:18:34,240
That's a real problem.

3395
02:18:34,570 --> 02:18:36,820
And that's because there aren't
things about materialism.

3396
02:18:37,240 --> 02:18:39,630
There's lots of things about the truth.

3397
02:18:39,920 --> 02:18:44,110
You can tell that by the technology
will Howard is grass material,

3398
02:18:44,970 --> 02:18:48,590
but the downside of materialism
and there's technical
reasons for this stuff is

3399
02:18:48,591 --> 02:18:49,290
happening.

3400
02:18:49,290 --> 02:18:53,620
So it doesn't provide the way
guiding yourself in the world.

3401
02:18:53,680 --> 02:18:55,650
That's actually a huge needle.

3402
02:18:55,870 --> 02:18:56,720
We have guidance.

3403
02:18:58,060 --> 02:19:02,010
So this is part of the problem that
I have with Sam Harris for example,

3404
02:19:02,011 --> 02:19:05,450
is he tries to conjure an ethic
code of his materialistic atheistic.

3405
02:19:05,520 --> 02:19:05,890
It's like,

3406
02:19:05,890 --> 02:19:06,041
well,

3407
02:19:06,041 --> 02:19:07,150
good luck with that.

3408
02:19:07,420 --> 02:19:09,200
It's not obvious how to do that.

3409
02:19:09,340 --> 02:19:11,860
And that doesn't make me
a critic of materialism.

3410
02:19:12,130 --> 02:19:13,030
I'm a scientist.

3411
02:19:13,031 --> 02:19:13,510
I know,

3412
02:19:13,510 --> 02:19:17,830
I know the utility of the materialistic
view mode and I'm very much appreciative

3413
02:19:17,831 --> 02:19:19,340
of the tech I want you to do is produced.

3414
02:19:19,610 --> 02:19:22,780
But bridging that gap to
an ethic that's a big Bro.

3415
02:19:22,990 --> 02:19:27,370
And it's partly the reason that
it's a problem is because science,

3416
02:19:27,410 --> 02:19:31,490
Chase's epics power up
the argument technically.

3417
02:19:32,240 --> 02:19:33,620
Because what most schools can do,

3418
02:19:33,621 --> 02:19:34,480
if you're a science,

3419
02:19:34,590 --> 02:19:35,423
sorry,

3420
02:19:35,460 --> 02:19:37,790
get rid of the value judgements.

3421
02:19:38,590 --> 02:19:38,751
Well,

3422
02:19:38,751 --> 02:19:40,640
that's not because the system,

3423
02:19:40,880 --> 02:19:45,020
it's because they interfere with your
description of that lies beyond no

3424
02:19:45,021 --> 02:19:45,854
judgements,

3425
02:19:45,980 --> 02:19:50,270
but there's still the domain of value and
contentment science camp 10 women say,

3426
02:19:50,271 --> 02:19:50,391
well,

3427
02:19:50,391 --> 02:19:50,661
if you say,

3428
02:19:50,661 --> 02:19:50,781
well,

3429
02:19:50,781 --> 02:19:51,561
it doesn't exist.

3430
02:19:51,561 --> 02:19:51,910
It's like,

3431
02:19:51,910 --> 02:19:52,743
no,

3432
02:19:53,060 --> 02:19:53,990
that's wrong.

3433
02:19:54,050 --> 02:19:55,040
It's seriously,

3434
02:19:55,041 --> 02:19:56,240
seriously wrong.

3435
02:19:56,300 --> 02:19:59,120
It even exists as an empirical phenomena,

3436
02:19:59,190 --> 02:20:01,700
limited universe of value are we're,

3437
02:20:01,701 --> 02:20:02,270
we're,

3438
02:20:02,270 --> 02:20:07,270
we're neurologically adapted to a world
of value to the serious flaws in that

3439
02:20:07,530 --> 02:20:10,700
serious flaws in them and breezy.

3440
02:20:10,760 --> 02:20:15,760
And it's hard on me because if you're
hearing materialistic in your outlook and

3441
02:20:16,251 --> 02:20:17,690
you don't have an ethos to fall,

3442
02:20:17,710 --> 02:20:18,543
a tie was,

3443
02:20:19,500 --> 02:20:22,240
and I would say that's actually proof
that there's something wrong with the

3444
02:20:22,790 --> 02:20:23,623
theory.

3445
02:20:23,710 --> 02:20:26,360
The theory makes you whole us and,

3446
02:20:26,380 --> 02:20:26,681
and,

3447
02:20:26,681 --> 02:20:27,020
and,

3448
02:20:27,020 --> 02:20:29,400
and deployed to the purpose and,

3449
02:20:29,410 --> 02:20:29,990
and,

3450
02:20:29,990 --> 02:20:33,980
and what relates to bear to the
suffering of life with no recourse.

3451
02:20:34,210 --> 02:20:35,900
If there's something wrong with period,

3452
02:20:36,860 --> 02:20:37,693
at least that's,

3453
02:20:37,730 --> 02:20:38,630
that's a possibility.

3454
02:20:39,040 --> 02:20:40,700
That's what it looks like to me.

3455
02:20:41,490 --> 02:20:42,323
This is,

3456
02:20:42,630 --> 02:20:42,860
you know,

3457
02:20:42,860 --> 02:20:43,700
this is something else,

3458
02:20:43,701 --> 02:20:45,220
but you can go on after me.

3459
02:20:45,890 --> 02:20:47,480
There wasn't my decision Harris,

3460
02:20:48,140 --> 02:20:50,690
but I think that's mostly because they
don't understand what the hell I'm

3461
02:20:50,691 --> 02:20:51,524
talking about.

3462
02:20:51,620 --> 02:20:55,010
One of the things neat you
said was the truth serves life.

3463
02:20:55,410 --> 02:20:57,290
That's an definition

3464
02:20:58,800 --> 02:21:00,020
definition.

3465
02:21:00,140 --> 02:21:03,920
Say Well no one truth is truth is what
you extract from an aggregation of

3466
02:21:03,921 --> 02:21:05,810
material fast find.

3467
02:21:05,840 --> 02:21:06,890
That's definition too,

3468
02:21:06,891 --> 02:21:07,724
but that doesn't,

3469
02:21:07,890 --> 02:21:10,580
it doesn't mean that that
definition is a priori.

3470
02:21:10,581 --> 02:21:11,414
Correct.

3471
02:21:11,690 --> 02:21:12,830
Because you're not just,

3472
02:21:12,980 --> 02:21:15,130
you're not just a fact gathering creature.

3473
02:21:15,230 --> 02:21:15,531
In fact,

3474
02:21:15,531 --> 02:21:17,840
your heart in fact cavity creature at all.

3475
02:21:17,870 --> 02:21:20,360
There's something that striving to live,

3476
02:21:20,900 --> 02:21:23,630
we need a truth that
loves to distract live.

3477
02:21:23,870 --> 02:21:27,710
There's no evidence that the
materialistic viewpoint provides that.

3478
02:21:28,160 --> 02:21:28,491
You say,

3479
02:21:28,491 --> 02:21:28,641
well,

3480
02:21:28,641 --> 02:21:29,260
it's complete.

3481
02:21:29,260 --> 02:21:33,490
It's like there's no evidence that it's
complete and not only best separately.

3482
02:21:33,500 --> 02:21:38,500
The constant revision was like 15 years
ago we found out that we didn't even

3483
02:21:38,511 --> 02:21:41,720
know what 95% of the universalist made up.

3484
02:21:41,870 --> 02:21:44,360
There's plenty of surprises yet to come.

3485
02:21:44,840 --> 02:21:45,673
So,

3486
02:21:46,130 --> 02:21:48,900
so drew is the tricky
thing then to tricky vague.

3487
02:21:48,980 --> 02:21:51,590
It's not self evident by any
stretch of the imagination.

3488
02:21:51,880 --> 02:21:53,100
You whoa,

3489
02:21:58,090 --> 02:21:59,660
why didn't you take them to church?

3490
02:22:00,560 --> 02:22:01,393
Yeah,

3491
02:22:02,300 --> 02:22:03,320
solve the problem.

3492
02:22:03,340 --> 02:22:06,150
And what's your advice for people
with young children that maybe

3493
02:22:08,280 --> 02:22:10,280
you're stroking the church?

3494
02:22:12,330 --> 02:22:13,260
It's like,

3495
02:22:14,360 --> 02:22:15,193
I don't know,

3496
02:22:16,130 --> 02:22:18,080
I be trying to puzzle it out.

3497
02:22:18,140 --> 02:22:18,371
Uh,

3498
02:22:18,371 --> 02:22:20,280
I have a friend and
this chocolate passion,

3499
02:22:21,740 --> 02:22:22,460
he likes,

3500
02:22:22,460 --> 02:22:24,410
he likes the liturgical ceremonies,

3501
02:22:24,411 --> 02:22:24,681
you know,

3502
02:22:24,681 --> 02:22:26,520
and he ever to go to the one in Seattle.

3503
02:22:26,521 --> 02:22:28,530
And I have to say we actually
for that I've always had,

3504
02:22:28,560 --> 02:22:30,000
which was I can hardly
wait til this is all,

3505
02:22:30,230 --> 02:22:31,063
you know.

3506
02:22:31,750 --> 02:22:33,580
[inaudible]

3507
02:22:34,130 --> 02:22:34,963
what was,

3508
02:22:35,300 --> 02:22:36,510
it doesn't always have,

3509
02:22:38,820 --> 02:22:41,900
I really wasn't a fan of school.

3510
02:22:42,980 --> 02:22:45,620
I had plenty of years that I was there.

3511
02:22:45,850 --> 02:22:47,660
And I think it's sitting in those,

3512
02:22:48,210 --> 02:22:49,043
in that

3513
02:22:50,870 --> 02:22:52,880
context brings that up.

3514
02:22:53,870 --> 02:22:58,400
I was so bored at school like
I to just like all my things,

3515
02:22:58,401 --> 02:23:02,180
like I was serious before
and I've had enough of that.

3516
02:23:12,320 --> 02:23:12,510
No,

3517
02:23:12,510 --> 02:23:15,500
I mean one of the things when I look back,

3518
02:23:16,730 --> 02:23:17,930
religious education,

3519
02:23:17,931 --> 02:23:18,170
you know,

3520
02:23:18,170 --> 02:23:19,600
cause I went to [inaudible],

3521
02:23:20,360 --> 02:23:22,040
I did learn the stories,

3522
02:23:25,020 --> 02:23:25,980
you know,

3523
02:23:26,040 --> 02:23:27,430
I was familiar enough with the story.

3524
02:23:27,440 --> 02:23:29,030
So they were in my imagination,

3525
02:23:29,300 --> 02:23:30,260
had turned out to be out.

3526
02:23:30,380 --> 02:23:31,610
Unbelievable work.

3527
02:23:32,370 --> 02:23:36,740
So I would say if you don't
bring your kids to church,

3528
02:23:36,741 --> 02:23:38,830
then you have a problem
with how the world of it,

3529
02:23:38,831 --> 02:23:39,631
where the store.

3530
02:23:39,631 --> 02:23:44,631
So because church has done a pretty good
job preserving the transmitting stories

3531
02:23:46,240 --> 02:23:48,530
and I think the stories
are necessary and useful.

3532
02:23:49,220 --> 02:23:50,040
So,

3533
02:23:50,040 --> 02:23:51,740
but I don't have a better
solution than that.

3534
02:23:51,741 --> 02:23:51,960
Yeah,

3535
02:23:51,960 --> 02:23:52,793
you put

3536
02:23:54,810 --> 02:23:55,643
wild.

3537
02:23:56,000 --> 02:23:56,840
Well you could,

3538
02:23:56,841 --> 02:23:58,690
but it takes a lot of
discipline with them.

3539
02:23:59,050 --> 02:23:59,883
You know,

3540
02:23:59,930 --> 02:24:02,660
it's often something that you might
want to parse off to someone else.

3541
02:24:02,661 --> 02:24:02,841
I mean,

3542
02:24:02,841 --> 02:24:03,860
maybe it can handle it.

3543
02:24:03,861 --> 02:24:04,730
Maybe we'll do it.

3544
02:24:05,060 --> 02:24:05,893
You can read to them,

3545
02:24:05,920 --> 02:24:06,381
so on.

3546
02:24:06,381 --> 02:24:08,450
But if it's a major commitment,

3547
02:24:10,070 --> 02:24:12,090
so yeah,

3548
02:24:19,250 --> 02:24:20,730
I'd like to say yes.

3549
02:24:26,250 --> 02:24:26,581
You know,

3550
02:24:26,581 --> 02:24:29,160
they learn most of the
stories could be in my house.

3551
02:24:31,490 --> 02:24:33,630
So maybe I managed that.

3552
02:24:33,940 --> 02:24:34,773
Oh,

3553
02:24:35,250 --> 02:24:38,810
I'm very ambivalent about that because
part of me thinks that I should go.

3554
02:24:45,950 --> 02:24:47,290
Probably I should go.

3555
02:24:48,290 --> 02:24:49,123
Okay.

3556
02:24:51,390 --> 02:24:52,223
Um,

3557
02:24:52,380 --> 02:24:53,430
you said that you,

3558
02:24:53,431 --> 02:24:54,010
uh,

3559
02:24:54,010 --> 02:24:58,270
sit here of individual be a collection
of semi-independent motivations.

3560
02:24:58,800 --> 02:25:03,800
And I was wondering if that scales up to
say a business with maybe like a horde

3561
02:25:05,730 --> 02:25:06,740
of consciousness.

3562
02:25:06,770 --> 02:25:11,770
They don't wonder Mike that also scale
up to say a government maybe could,

3563
02:25:12,510 --> 02:25:17,340
the way you conceptualize this rules
maybe apply to some of these people

3564
02:25:17,350 --> 02:25:21,700
wondering what should the principles
of maybe self governance be?

3565
02:25:21,710 --> 02:25:24,160
Maybe if we figure out maybe

3566
02:25:24,160 --> 02:25:24,993
that scales up

3567
02:25:27,360 --> 02:25:32,360
question to that brings up is how does
kind of looking inside avoid becoming

3568
02:25:33,830 --> 02:25:35,760
jingoistic right?

3569
02:25:35,761 --> 02:25:36,561
So like if,

3570
02:25:36,561 --> 02:25:41,340
if if the government is looking into
itself first in order to solve its

3571
02:25:41,341 --> 02:25:42,174
problems,

3572
02:25:42,580 --> 02:25:46,370
what separates that and then that same
question skills down like how do you a

3573
02:25:46,560 --> 02:25:49,720
and being self centered
when you're focusing on,

3574
02:25:50,270 --> 02:25:50,941
you see what I'm saying?

3575
02:25:50,941 --> 02:25:51,774
Yeah.

3576
02:25:51,810 --> 02:25:53,490
It becomes obvious when you scale it up,

3577
02:25:53,491 --> 02:25:54,550
but how does it would,

3578
02:25:55,360 --> 02:25:56,193
when it scales

3579
02:25:57,870 --> 02:26:01,810
me self centered is actually a good
solution to the problems that you,

3580
02:26:02,310 --> 02:26:02,800
you know,

3581
02:26:02,800 --> 02:26:06,740
because you might say as a collection
of semi autonomous spirits,

3582
02:26:06,741 --> 02:26:11,510
which is certainly the psychoanalytic
point and I think a biological viewpoint

3583
02:26:11,511 --> 02:26:12,080
as well.

3584
02:26:12,080 --> 02:26:13,070
I mean you,

3585
02:26:13,640 --> 02:26:18,440
you are a center that degration but you're
definitely also a collection of semi

3586
02:26:18,441 --> 02:26:20,060
autonomous processes.

3587
02:26:20,360 --> 02:26:20,900
You know,

3588
02:26:20,900 --> 02:26:21,733
um,

3589
02:26:22,340 --> 02:26:24,750
the question is how to
bring those into the unity.

3590
02:26:24,840 --> 02:26:25,371
You might say,

3591
02:26:25,371 --> 02:26:26,960
well you do that by,

3592
02:26:26,961 --> 02:26:31,040
I don't pick the self centered
perspective to bring those into unity,

3593
02:26:31,041 --> 02:26:32,570
but unity isn't,

3594
02:26:32,930 --> 02:26:34,160
isn't self centered.

3595
02:26:34,220 --> 02:26:35,460
And I think the reason for that,

3596
02:26:35,461 --> 02:26:36,710
and I kind of like that tonight,

3597
02:26:37,320 --> 02:26:40,430
you get those things operating
harmoniously together.

3598
02:26:40,710 --> 02:26:42,800
Just what you do is socialize a child.

3599
02:26:43,730 --> 02:26:47,300
They have to be serving the
child's interest now but
in a way that doesn't need

3600
02:26:47,301 --> 02:26:50,660
to fear what the child's interests
as it propagates across time.

3601
02:26:50,750 --> 02:26:53,420
And that's an unbelievably
tight set of constraints.

3602
02:26:53,421 --> 02:26:54,680
And you see that operating,

3603
02:26:54,681 --> 02:26:55,770
I didn't talk about this time.

3604
02:26:55,771 --> 02:26:57,770
And you see that offer
even in the animal kingdom,

3605
02:26:58,400 --> 02:27:01,880
you know when animals organized there
hierarchies I know that aren't going to

3606
02:27:01,881 --> 02:27:04,220
organize themselves in
a manner of its purity,

3607
02:27:04,240 --> 02:27:05,360
self-serving if they're,

3608
02:27:05,380 --> 02:27:08,850
if they're social animals and
they also organize them in a way.

3609
02:27:08,900 --> 02:27:13,330
Keeps the rights of the other elements
in mind as they organized the threats.

3610
02:27:13,380 --> 02:27:13,820
Yeah.

3611
02:27:13,820 --> 02:27:17,510
The rats are like the walls are
like the chimpanzees know so,

3612
02:27:17,570 --> 02:27:19,350
so that's self center need.

3613
02:27:19,530 --> 02:27:22,220
It doesn't need to work
parameters much less for us.

3614
02:27:22,930 --> 02:27:23,240
It's so,

3615
02:27:23,240 --> 02:27:24,960
and I think it's because things have,

3616
02:27:25,220 --> 02:27:27,710
I think it's because things
have to iterate across time,

3617
02:27:27,760 --> 02:27:32,720
headed up the rules for
successful iteration produce very,

3618
02:27:32,721 --> 02:27:36,500
very tight constraints on behavior
in any particular situation.

3619
02:27:37,080 --> 02:27:38,600
So you get an emergent debt.

3620
02:27:39,370 --> 02:27:41,460
What do you think that
scales the same way.

3621
02:27:41,461 --> 02:27:43,880
The bigger you get to say
with the company and with,

3622
02:27:44,170 --> 02:27:45,410
with maybe a governor like,

3623
02:27:45,440 --> 02:27:49,000
well I don't know because I think
things can get so fake and he just call,

3624
02:27:49,480 --> 02:27:50,000
you know,

3625
02:27:50,000 --> 02:27:52,440
I think that's the lesson
of the Tower of Babel.

3626
02:27:52,520 --> 02:27:54,000
It might even be the lesson up.

3627
02:27:54,080 --> 02:27:54,913
Uh,

3628
02:27:55,450 --> 02:28:00,290
the European Economic Union
might be less than that.

3629
02:28:00,291 --> 02:28:01,250
The United States too,

3630
02:28:01,251 --> 02:28:03,190
because sometimes I take
that about the last,

3631
02:28:03,191 --> 02:28:05,330
I think it's just to me,

3632
02:28:05,331 --> 02:28:06,380
certainly California

3633
02:28:06,970 --> 02:28:11,970
[inaudible]

3634
02:28:13,670 --> 02:28:14,503
so big.

3635
02:28:14,510 --> 02:28:16,570
It is clear that it can be

3636
02:28:18,500 --> 02:28:20,290
like what you do to your presidents.

3637
02:28:20,291 --> 02:28:21,124
It's just like

3638
02:28:23,510 --> 02:28:24,343
too much.

3639
02:28:25,250 --> 02:28:26,240
It's just too much.

3640
02:28:26,520 --> 02:28:26,701
Oh,

3641
02:28:26,701 --> 02:28:28,270
it's 300 million people.

3642
02:28:31,150 --> 02:28:32,710
Luckily it's the person

3643
02:28:35,910 --> 02:28:36,581
that's part of it.

3644
02:28:36,581 --> 02:28:40,770
We are addressing them to make
the units more autonomous.

3645
02:28:42,900 --> 02:28:43,520
No,

3646
02:28:43,520 --> 02:28:43,851
sorry,

3647
02:28:43,851 --> 02:28:44,684
this May

3648
02:29:04,630 --> 02:29:09,630
[inaudible] [inaudible]

3649
02:30:06,950 --> 02:30:11,950
[inaudible] [inaudible]

3650
02:30:15,560 --> 02:30:17,520
I can't give you any detail just

3651
02:30:19,350 --> 02:30:21,710
because I don't know what he said.

3652
02:30:21,711 --> 02:30:22,544
Well,

3653
02:30:31,620 --> 02:30:32,453
I'm glad.

3654
02:31:22,550 --> 02:31:26,550
So then for you guys to do it and not
only you and I just had a core like we

3655
02:31:26,551 --> 02:31:28,140
were just kind of thing.

3656
02:31:28,160 --> 02:31:28,993
So the ones that,

3657
02:31:30,010 --> 02:31:30,310
hey,

3658
02:31:30,310 --> 02:31:31,330
this is amazing,

3659
02:31:32,210 --> 02:31:33,360
but it's also kind of mediator,

3660
02:31:34,170 --> 02:31:39,170
I think other folks to be hopefully
more rise to all because of one of the

3661
02:31:39,820 --> 02:31:44,820
[inaudible] just really special time.

3662
02:31:48,130 --> 02:31:48,963
Reuben,

3663
02:31:51,830 --> 02:31:52,740
the one thing

3664
02:31:58,730 --> 02:31:59,563
I

3665
02:32:01,420 --> 02:32:06,040
find that I'm sure you
pick up on this bill,

3666
02:32:06,090 --> 02:32:06,481
Sam,

3667
02:32:06,481 --> 02:32:10,610
about what clubs and that kind of
have that similar kind of mid eighties

3668
02:32:13,710 --> 02:32:14,543
about religion

3669
02:32:17,700 --> 02:32:18,940
and hopefully someday.

3670
02:32:20,010 --> 02:32:24,450
What I noticed is you said
a little bit here earlier,

3671
02:32:24,480 --> 02:32:26,520
but not with kind of the tone.

3672
02:32:26,570 --> 02:32:27,350
What's it?

3673
02:32:27,350 --> 02:32:28,740
Some of the times it comes across.

3674
02:32:32,370 --> 02:32:36,090
My concern is that he's
such an awesome time.

3675
02:32:37,050 --> 02:32:37,883
There's an origin,

3676
02:32:40,150 --> 02:32:43,650
a polarization of sharecroppers.

3677
02:32:51,140 --> 02:32:53,880
If some of the posts he was on paper,

3678
02:32:54,370 --> 02:32:54,910
um,

3679
02:32:54,910 --> 02:32:55,743
what's today?

3680
02:32:56,750 --> 02:32:57,980
And I noticed

3681
02:33:03,310 --> 02:33:08,310
like here,

3682
02:33:09,270 --> 02:33:10,103
I would see

3683
02:33:12,610 --> 02:33:14,210
recoverable the careful way.

3684
02:33:14,220 --> 02:33:16,680
Not to fix it too much on you,

3685
02:33:16,700 --> 02:33:17,710
but just as you're,

3686
02:33:18,120 --> 02:33:19,020
as you said,

3687
02:33:19,140 --> 02:33:19,710
these are,

3688
02:33:19,710 --> 02:33:20,850
these are cut of,

3689
02:33:21,180 --> 02:33:23,480
maybe the presentation is something,

3690
02:33:23,890 --> 02:33:25,210
but it is or not,

3691
02:33:25,211 --> 02:33:29,800
but just like seeing him kind of
doing some variation of the same.

3692
02:33:32,850 --> 02:33:35,690
And the reason why is that
why it's important because

3693
02:33:38,380 --> 02:33:41,400
I think you guys had an
opportunity to really,

3694
02:33:45,980 --> 02:33:50,630
just because of the nature of folks
who work with are perceived to be

3695
02:33:50,720 --> 02:33:51,553
conservative,

3696
02:33:52,380 --> 02:33:53,730
are going to the attack.

3697
02:33:56,090 --> 02:33:56,910
Be careful not to,

3698
02:33:56,910 --> 02:34:01,910
you almost have to be stark apartments
before any power was every possible

3699
02:34:03,930 --> 02:34:04,763
energy.

3700
02:34:05,570 --> 02:34:06,403
Yes.

3701
02:34:08,140 --> 02:34:10,010
Because sometimes they ask,

3702
02:34:10,020 --> 02:34:11,220
you get so cash in your life.

3703
02:34:14,410 --> 02:34:16,500
Luckily the people that aren't
that is to certainly go,

3704
02:34:16,510 --> 02:34:17,620
maybe this is,

3705
02:34:19,380 --> 02:34:20,213
what am I going to say

3706
02:34:20,550 --> 02:34:21,383
and

3707
02:34:24,000 --> 02:34:24,833
be that example.

3708
02:34:35,880 --> 02:34:37,710
That's right.

3709
02:34:37,820 --> 02:34:38,653
Exactly.

3710
02:34:42,830 --> 02:34:47,830
[inaudible] [inaudible].
