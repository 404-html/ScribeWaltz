1
00:00:06,830 --> 00:00:10,400
What advice would you give to
someone looking to quit porn?

2
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:11,840
Well,

3
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:15,260
I gave some advice a little
earlier about quitting alcohol.

4
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:15,780
You know,

5
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:19,250
and I would say it isn't that
you're turning to quit porn.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,430
It's not the right way to think about it.

7
00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:25,070
The right way to think about it is that
you're trying to figure out how to have

8
00:00:25,071 --> 00:00:26,060
a better life.

9
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:27,920
And so you have to figure out,

10
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:33,650
well I would say do the future authoring
program and keep your porn addiction in

11
00:00:33,651 --> 00:00:37,670
mind and think so in the first part
of the future authoring program,

12
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:42,740
it asks you a bunch of questions about
what your life could be like in three to

13
00:00:42,741 --> 00:00:45,830
five years if you took care of yourself
like you were someone that you cared

14
00:00:45,831 --> 00:00:46,664
for.

15
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:48,043
Um,

16
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:53,110
and then it asks you questions about
your friends and your family and your

17
00:00:53,721 --> 00:00:57,470
career and your time outside of
work and your health and you know,

18
00:00:57,471 --> 00:00:58,850
the important dimensions of life.

19
00:00:58,850 --> 00:00:59,270
And it,

20
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:00,590
it asks you to spend

21
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:06,050
20 minutes writing about how good your
life could be in three to five years if

22
00:01:06,051 --> 00:01:08,270
you got your act together and
did what was good for you.

23
00:01:08,271 --> 00:01:11,090
And then it asked you to write about
the hell you could be in if you didn't.

24
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:15,440
And so I would say you really need to
do that because porn isn't the issue.

25
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:18,470
The issue is that you're not living
your life the way you want to.

26
00:01:18,471 --> 00:01:23,270
And so you need a vision of life
that's more compelling than the porn.

27
00:01:23,271 --> 00:01:25,610
And you need a counter
vision to that frightens you.

28
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:26,631
You know,

29
00:01:26,631 --> 00:01:31,190
because otherwise porn is obviously
extraordinarily gratifying in the short

30
00:01:31,191 --> 00:01:31,461
term,

31
00:01:31,461 --> 00:01:31,870
but,

32
00:01:31,870 --> 00:01:35,780
but you seem to be suffering from the
medium to longterm consequences of its

33
00:01:35,781 --> 00:01:36,614
use.

34
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:41,300
And so you need a story that you can tell
yourself that's really deeply thought

35
00:01:41,301 --> 00:01:44,660
through about why this is
not appropriate for you.

36
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:45,591
What's what,

37
00:01:45,591 --> 00:01:49,670
it's how it's hurting you and how it's
minimizing you and perhaps making you

38
00:01:49,671 --> 00:01:53,090
embarrassed and ashamed and more
socially isolated and all of that.

39
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:58,480
So I would say think about it as
cleaning up your psyche and your behavior

40
00:01:58,911 --> 00:02:00,980
rather than merely start stopping,

41
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:03,371
stopping poor.

42
00:02:03,371 --> 00:02:05,120
And you also might want to write down,

43
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:08,360
and you could do this
in a negative vision,

44
00:02:08,361 --> 00:02:09,740
part of the future authoring program.

45
00:02:09,741 --> 00:02:13,110
You got to write down everything bad
that you think porn is doing to you,

46
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:17,690
because obviously you have some
suspicions that this is not good for you,

47
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:18,051
right?

48
00:02:18,051 --> 00:02:18,740
That it's,

49
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:21,230
that it's actually harming
you in some important way.

50
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:26,710
And so you need to be fully cognizant of
what those ways are and then take them

51
00:02:27,111 --> 00:02:32,111
seriously and decide if that's the
pathway through life on which you wish to

52
00:02:32,481 --> 00:02:33,880
travel and so on.

53
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:35,540
Then I would also say good luck to you.

54
00:02:35,541 --> 00:02:35,841
You know,

55
00:02:35,841 --> 00:02:36,674
it's,

56
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:40,790
it's a very good idea to identify one
of your weaknesses and work on it on you

57
00:02:40,791 --> 00:02:41,120
can,

58
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,070
you can strengthen
yourself substantially by,

59
00:02:43,071 --> 00:02:43,280
dude.
