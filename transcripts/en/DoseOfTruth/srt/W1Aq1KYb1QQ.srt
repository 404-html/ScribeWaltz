1
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:10,030
What do wisdom have you acquired in the
past few months that you want to share

2
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:10,850
with us?

3
00:00:10,850 --> 00:00:11,031
Well,

4
00:00:11,031 --> 00:00:11,721
I've got one.

5
00:00:11,721 --> 00:00:12,730
I think I,

6
00:00:12,731 --> 00:00:14,450
I've thought thought of
a bunch of new things,

7
00:00:14,451 --> 00:00:16,040
but this one I'm really happy with.

8
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:17,343
Um,

9
00:00:17,690 --> 00:00:19,070
I figured out why.

10
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:20,880
You know,

11
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:25,880
some of you know that there's a
mythological trope that I discussed fairly

12
00:00:25,881 --> 00:00:30,230
frequently about rescuing your father
from the belly of the dragon or the belly

13
00:00:30,231 --> 00:00:31,064
of the beast.

14
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:34,790
It's a motif that you see when
you see it in the lion king.

15
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:35,810
Um,

16
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:39,380
you see it when Simba is being
initiated by the baboons.

17
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:41,640
I don't remember Nephi Nitpicky,

18
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:42,590
I think his name is,

19
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:43,550
um,

20
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:48,110
after Nela humiliates him because
he's still a pathetic adolescent.

21
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:50,780
He follows the baboons.

22
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:56,090
I think it's a mandrill
actually down underground,

23
00:00:56,091 --> 00:00:57,620
essentially through a long tunnel.

24
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:00,740
There's a lot of kind of scary music
in the background and the ends up

25
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:05,570
contemplating himself in a dark pool
and then his father appears in the sky.

26
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:10,840
And so that's one example of the
re construction of the mythology of

27
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:14,030
encountering your father in the abyss.

28
00:01:14,031 --> 00:01:16,130
You look into the abyss
and you see your father.

29
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:18,050
And then in the Pinocchio Story,

30
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:19,040
um,

31
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:19,940
Pinocchio of course,

32
00:01:19,941 --> 00:01:22,400
when he's trying to become
a genuine human being,

33
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:27,470
instead of a marionette pulled by other
people's strings or a neurotic or a,

34
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:29,510
or a liar or a jackass,

35
00:01:29,511 --> 00:01:31,530
cause those are his alternate destinies.

36
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:32,630
Um,

37
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:36,470
he goes down to the darkest place he
could find the bottom of the ocean and

38
00:01:36,471 --> 00:01:37,640
finds the biggest monster.

39
00:01:37,641 --> 00:01:40,940
He can look at it and inside he
finds his father and in rescues him.

40
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:42,373
Um,

41
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:43,490
and the question is,

42
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:46,910
why do you find your father
when you look into the abyss?

43
00:01:47,330 --> 00:01:51,320
And I really did do think I figured
this out and it's quite exciting to me.

44
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:53,510
It's such a brilliant image.

45
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:56,180
So we know as clinicians and,

46
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:58,220
and also I would say a sensible people,

47
00:01:58,221 --> 00:02:02,030
but there's good clinical documentation
of this that if you find out,

48
00:02:02,410 --> 00:02:07,410
imagine someone's pursuing a goal and
some of the things they have to accomplish

49
00:02:07,850 --> 00:02:10,640
or confront on the way to that goal,

50
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:13,100
frightened them and they start to avoid.

51
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:14,420
And then they get more afraid.

52
00:02:14,421 --> 00:02:19,130
And of course their ability to pursue
their goal or to accomplish their goal

53
00:02:19,131 --> 00:02:20,750
deteriorates because they're avoiding,

54
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,710
if you're a psychotherapist
or even a friend or or,

55
00:02:24,711 --> 00:02:26,180
or a supportive loved one,

56
00:02:26,181 --> 00:02:31,070
let's say you're going to encourage the
person to face the challenges that are

57
00:02:31,071 --> 00:02:33,530
making them afraid to
face them voluntarily.

58
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:39,470
And what happens as a consequence of that
is that the person usually is able to

59
00:02:39,471 --> 00:02:44,010
overcome those fears and develop
the necessary skills and,

60
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:45,410
and to prevail.

61
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:49,580
And that's partly because not so
much because they get less afraid,

62
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:52,850
but because they get more
skilled and more courageous.

63
00:02:52,851 --> 00:02:54,770
And so imagine that if you

64
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:58,160
bite off a little more than you can chew,

65
00:02:58,161 --> 00:03:00,400
you get stronger as a consequence.

66
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:02,260
And you do that in the gym.

67
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:02,861
For example,

68
00:03:02,861 --> 00:03:03,910
when you go lift weights,

69
00:03:03,911 --> 00:03:06,010
you lift weights that are a
little heavier all the time.

70
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:07,360
And as a consequence,

71
00:03:07,361 --> 00:03:10,970
you develop yourself physically
and you turn into who you could be.

72
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:12,670
You turned into more than you are.

73
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:13,631
Okay?

74
00:03:13,631 --> 00:03:17,320
So if you face fears a
little bit at a time,

75
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:18,370
fears and challenges,

76
00:03:18,371 --> 00:03:19,720
and you do that voluntarily,

77
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:22,330
then you become more than who you are.

78
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:23,261
Okay?

79
00:03:23,261 --> 00:03:27,250
Now let's recast that in architectural
language and make it into a kind of

80
00:03:27,251 --> 00:03:28,084
ultimate.

81
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:28,750
So,

82
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:32,200
so if you want to become
everything that you could be,

83
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:34,570
then you look into the abyss itself,

84
00:03:34,571 --> 00:03:37,510
which is the darkest place that
you can possibly contemplate.

85
00:03:37,511 --> 00:03:40,890
And that would be the terror of
Maura mortality and insanity and,

86
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:43,450
and of suffering and end of malevolence,

87
00:03:43,451 --> 00:03:44,051
all of those.

88
00:03:44,051 --> 00:03:45,430
It would be like looking into hell,

89
00:03:45,431 --> 00:03:46,810
I suppose to some degree.

90
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:50,950
And then by voluntarily doing that,

91
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:55,980
then you call upon the strongest part
of yourself to respond and the strongest

92
00:03:55,991 --> 00:04:00,610
part of yourself as symbolized as the
sleeping farther nested inside the beast.

93
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:06,060
And so the fundamental truth when you
look into an abyss is that you don't see

94
00:04:06,251 --> 00:04:06,791
the abyss.

95
00:04:06,791 --> 00:04:07,750
If you look long enough,

96
00:04:07,751 --> 00:04:10,270
it's like the unanswered
to niches conundrum.

97
00:04:10,271 --> 00:04:14,110
If you look long enough into a bis and
ambitious than the abyss looks into you,

98
00:04:14,111 --> 00:04:14,501
it's like,

99
00:04:14,501 --> 00:04:14,681
well,

100
00:04:14,681 --> 00:04:19,240
if you look long enough into an abyss
passed when the abyss looks into you,

101
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:22,450
you see who you could
become in the form of your,

102
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:27,480
of the great ancestral figures nested
inside the catastrophe of life,

103
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:30,070
and then you can join them,

104
00:04:30,071 --> 00:04:30,791
so to speak.

105
00:04:30,791 --> 00:04:33,280
You can incorporate that
and become stronger.

106
00:04:33,281 --> 00:04:36,970
And you do that partly by taking
on the challenge voluntarily.

107
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:41,500
And that informs you because you learn
when you take on challenges voluntarily.

108
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:45,790
But you also do that as a consequence
of psychophysiological transformation

109
00:04:45,791 --> 00:04:48,790
because when you place yourself
in challenging situations,

110
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,440
let's say the abyss is the archetype of
the ultimately challenging situation,

111
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:58,270
then you turn on new genes in your nervous
system and in your body that code for

112
00:04:58,271 --> 00:05:01,810
new proteins and you build
new structures inside of you.

113
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:06,430
And none of that's going to happen
without the demand that's placed on you by

114
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:09,340
willing to confront the
full terror of life.

115
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:13,720
And so then I would say the full terror
of life is something like the reality of

116
00:05:13,721 --> 00:05:14,680
suffering and death.

117
00:05:14,681 --> 00:05:19,681
And the ever present and the the ever
looming presence of malevolence in your

118
00:05:19,961 --> 00:05:21,700
own heart and in the
heart of other people.

119
00:05:21,701 --> 00:05:26,701
So it's evil and suffering and to
confront that is really well you risk

120
00:05:26,831 --> 00:05:28,360
blindness by confronting that.

121
00:05:28,361 --> 00:05:29,890
That's also a very old story.

122
00:05:29,891 --> 00:05:31,510
You risk damaging your vision,

123
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:33,850
but if you do it forthrightly,

124
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:39,730
then you discover who you could be as a
consequence and who you could be is the

125
00:05:39,731 --> 00:05:42,040
solution to malevolence and suffering.

126
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:45,010
And so that just blew me
away when I figured that out.

127
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:46,660
It was partly a consequence of,

128
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:47,893
um,

129
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:51,520
having lengthy discussions with Sam
Harris and thinking this through more and

130
00:05:51,521 --> 00:05:53,140
more been pushed to think it through.

131
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,900
But I think that's an
absolutely staggering.

132
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,153
Um,

133
00:05:58,220 --> 00:05:59,053
what would you call it?

134
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,580
Articulating that,

135
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:04,730
articulating that image fully for me.

136
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,070
I don't know if I've articulated it fully,

137
00:06:07,071 --> 00:06:10,370
but articulating it more fully
really had a profound effect on me.

138
00:06:10,371 --> 00:06:11,204
I think that's,

139
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:16,270
it's such a brilliant conceptualization
that inside the darkest place is the

140
00:06:17,781 --> 00:06:22,781
heroic ancestor that whose
identity you could incorporate.

141
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:24,380
Perfect.

142
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:25,101
It's perfect.

143
00:06:25,101 --> 00:06:26,120
And I really believe it's true.

144
00:06:26,121 --> 00:06:30,980
And what it does is it says that human
being is actually stronger than the

145
00:06:30,981 --> 00:06:34,100
greatest challenge that can
be set before him or her.

146
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:35,780
And that's really something.

147
00:06:35,781 --> 00:06:36,860
I also believe it's true.

148
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:38,053
It doesn't matter how,

149
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:41,420
the other thing that's so
interesting about that is that it,

150
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:44,180
it transforms pessimism into optimism.

151
00:06:44,181 --> 00:06:44,511
It's like,

152
00:06:44,511 --> 00:06:46,010
well the world is a very dark place.

153
00:06:46,011 --> 00:06:48,020
It's full of suffering and
it's full of malevolence.

154
00:06:48,021 --> 00:06:52,280
And it might even be so full of suffering
and malevolence that a reasonable

155
00:06:52,281 --> 00:06:56,980
person could question the
justification of its being a,

156
00:06:57,010 --> 00:06:58,780
as Ivan Grandma's off does in,

157
00:06:58,781 --> 00:07:01,280
in the brothers Karamazov
which I would highly recommend.

158
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:01,701
By the way,

159
00:07:01,701 --> 00:07:03,140
that's an absolutely great book,

160
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:03,983
Dostoevsky.

161
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:05,210
Um,

162
00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:06,170
but the,

163
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:10,820
the truth of the matter seems to be that
if you face the pessimism full frontal,

164
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:11,690
so to speak,

165
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:12,923
um,

166
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:15,380
then you find something in you that can,

167
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:18,560
that's strong enough to take it on.

168
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:20,990
And that's really says something about,

169
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:22,281
what would you say,

170
00:07:22,281 --> 00:07:24,590
the relationship between
human beings and divinity,

171
00:07:24,591 --> 00:07:25,424
I would say,

172
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:30,550
because it takes something transcendent
of transcendent power to be able to rise

173
00:07:33,231 --> 00:07:36,200
above the genuine suffering
and malevolence of life.

174
00:07:36,201 --> 00:07:39,920
And I do think that we have that
within us if we don't shy away from the

175
00:07:39,921 --> 00:07:40,754
challenge.

176
00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:42,620
So you know,

177
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:46,880
there's in the story of King
Arthur and the holy grail,

178
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:50,030
so the holy grail is one of two things.

179
00:07:50,031 --> 00:07:55,031
It's a cup that either held the wine
that Christ drank at the last supper or

180
00:07:55,161 --> 00:07:59,450
that was used to catch his blood
when he was speared on the cross.

181
00:07:59,570 --> 00:08:00,403
Either one.

182
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:01,490
But it's the,

183
00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:03,110
it's the reservoir,

184
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:03,741
let's say,

185
00:08:03,741 --> 00:08:06,590
of the fluid that eternally nourishes.

186
00:08:06,591 --> 00:08:07,700
It's something like that.

187
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:11,210
And when you go to look
for the holy Grail,

188
00:08:11,211 --> 00:08:14,180
you don't know where to look because
you don't know where the holy grail is.

189
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:17,660
And so King Arthur and his knights
who all sit at a round table,

190
00:08:17,661 --> 00:08:21,620
because there is essentially equals
each go off to find the holy grail.

191
00:08:21,621 --> 00:08:26,621
And each of them enters the forest to
begin the quest at the place that looks

192
00:08:26,841 --> 00:08:28,070
darkest to him.

193
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:31,790
And that's another
example of the same idea.

194
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:33,740
Is that what you and another,

195
00:08:33,741 --> 00:08:36,680
it's another example of
a dictum from Carl Young,

196
00:08:36,681 --> 00:08:38,840
which he extracted from the
oil chemical literature,

197
00:08:38,841 --> 00:08:42,140
which was in stir Colinas infinite tour,

198
00:08:42,350 --> 00:08:47,350
which means roughly speaking in filth
that will be found or more to the point

199
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:51,320
what you most need will be found
where you least want to look,

200
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:53,210
but you have to look purposefully.

201
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:54,740
If it chases you,

202
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:55,860
you're prey.

203
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:57,420
If you confront it,

204
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,670
then you're the thing
that can transcend it.

205
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:04,830
And that's a unbelievably optimistic
message because it suggests that if you're

206
00:09:04,831 --> 00:09:08,880
willing to take on the burden of being
with it's suffering and malevolence,

207
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:13,620
that you can awaken that with
that which is within you,

208
00:09:13,621 --> 00:09:18,621
that will allow you to prevail and God
only knows how deep an idea that is.

209
00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:24,630
It might be the deepest of ideas because
who knows what the limit of a human

210
00:09:24,901 --> 00:09:29,580
being is so well that's some
of the wisdom so to speak,

211
00:09:29,581 --> 00:09:32,690
that have acquired in the last few months
and there's quite a bit more too and,

212
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:36,580
but I'm going to write all this down
and hopefully publish a bunch of it.

213
00:09:36,581 --> 00:09:40,260
And my next book I figured out a bunch
about hierarchies to and how they

214
00:09:40,261 --> 00:09:40,741
function.

215
00:09:40,741 --> 00:09:41,910
And a whole,

216
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:45,930
I've developed a whole new
way of conceptualizing.

217
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:51,350
One of the things I was arguing with
about Sam arguing with about with Sam

218
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:54,510
Harris was the relationship
between facts and values.

219
00:09:54,511 --> 00:09:57,660
Because Sam and he has his reasons.

220
00:09:57,900 --> 00:10:01,410
We'd like to propose that we can
derive values directly from facts.

221
00:10:01,411 --> 00:10:05,430
And he wants to do that because he
wants to nail the world of values to

222
00:10:05,431 --> 00:10:07,730
something solid so it
doesn't float in air and,

223
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:08,300
and,

224
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:08,790
and,

225
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:09,510
and get,

226
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:10,343
let's say,

227
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:11,483
um,

228
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:12,900
what would you call it?

229
00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:18,120
Hijacked by the fundamentalists
or dissolve into nihilism.

230
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:21,180
And both of those are terrible
ends for a hierarchy of value.

231
00:10:21,181 --> 00:10:26,181
So he wants to nail it to
something more objective and,

232
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:29,760
and less relativistic and less,

233
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:36,300
less grounded in revealed truth
that removes it from the domain of

234
00:10:36,301 --> 00:10:36,991
fundamentalism.

235
00:10:36,991 --> 00:10:40,380
And so I can understand his point
and why he wants to do that.

236
00:10:40,381 --> 00:10:44,310
But the problem is is that it isn't
easy to derive values from facts because

237
00:10:44,311 --> 00:10:49,311
there's an infinite number of facts and
by necessity a very finite number of

238
00:10:49,441 --> 00:10:50,070
values.

239
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:50,880
In fact,

240
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,380
most of the time when
you're doing something,

241
00:10:52,381 --> 00:10:57,240
you're reducing the whole world to one
value and that value is encapsulated in

242
00:10:57,241 --> 00:11:00,570
whatever goal you happen to be pursuing
at the moment or whatever you're paying

243
00:11:00,571 --> 00:11:01,231
attention to,

244
00:11:01,231 --> 00:11:03,450
which is also a form of
goal directed pursuit.

245
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:05,400
And so I've also figured out that,

246
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,110
and I kind of knew this,

247
00:11:07,111 --> 00:11:08,790
but I could articulate it better now,

248
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:13,050
that you look at the world of facts
through a hierarchy of values and that

249
00:11:13,051 --> 00:11:17,830
hierarchy of values is instantiated in
your nervous system and Simile Tanium as

250
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,740
a social construct because you pay
attention to things of value that you and

251
00:11:22,741 --> 00:11:27,720
everyone else have established as
valuable through a process of social

252
00:11:27,721 --> 00:11:28,560
negotiation.

253
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:31,830
And you need to pay attention to
what you think that's valuable,

254
00:11:31,831 --> 00:11:35,700
that everyone else thinks is valuable
because otherwise you wouldn't have any

255
00:11:35,701 --> 00:11:39,630
basis for shared attention
and you wouldn't have any
basis for trade with other

256
00:11:39,631 --> 00:11:40,410
people.

257
00:11:40,410 --> 00:11:41,490
So that's another thing.

258
00:11:41,491 --> 00:11:43,590
So that's really been helpful because,

259
00:11:43,890 --> 00:11:48,890
so now I figured out that you reduce the
infinite world of facts to the finite

260
00:11:49,381 --> 00:11:54,381
world of values by viewing the world
of facts through what's essentially a

261
00:11:54,401 --> 00:11:56,590
dominance hierarchy of value.

262
00:11:57,130 --> 00:11:57,963
And that's,

263
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:02,650
and that that exists both
out in the social world and
neurologically at the same

264
00:12:02,651 --> 00:12:03,190
time.

265
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:06,280
And so that's been unbelievably
useful to figure out too.

266
00:12:06,610 --> 00:12:10,480
And a part of a mystery that I'd been
trying to untangle for about three

267
00:12:10,481 --> 00:12:11,314
decades.

268
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:11,980
So.
