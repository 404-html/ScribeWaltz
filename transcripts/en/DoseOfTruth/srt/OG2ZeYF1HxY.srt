1
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:10,060
And then we'll get to the Q.

2
00:00:10,061 --> 00:00:10,151
And.

3
00:00:10,151 --> 00:00:10,640
A.

4
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:11,473
I think this,

5
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:16,450
this is the kind of thing that I'd like
to shed light on in any possible lecture

6
00:00:16,451 --> 00:00:17,590
series on marks.

7
00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:22,950
So this is called any advice
on effectively implementing
what I learned into my

8
00:00:24,641 --> 00:00:25,090
life.

9
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:27,430
I resonate with 12 rules
so much when reading,

10
00:00:27,431 --> 00:00:30,190
but struggle to remember
it in my day to day life.

11
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:30,850
Well,

12
00:00:30,850 --> 00:00:31,690
you're not alone.

13
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:32,680
That was Sam.

14
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:33,730
You're not alone in that,

15
00:00:33,731 --> 00:00:34,564
Sam.

16
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:34,961
I mean,

17
00:00:34,961 --> 00:00:35,501
first of all,

18
00:00:35,501 --> 00:00:37,450
you got to figure out
what your timeframe is.

19
00:00:37,451 --> 00:00:38,080
You know,

20
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:38,530
um,

21
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:43,530
one of the truisms of clinical
psychology is that slow and incremental

22
00:00:45,161 --> 00:00:46,900
improvement is first of all,

23
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:49,480
normative in the best possible way,

24
00:00:49,481 --> 00:00:51,130
in the most optimistic situation,

25
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:52,600
but also very powerful.

26
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:56,050
And so of course you struggled to remember
it in your day to day life because

27
00:00:56,260 --> 00:00:59,320
life is difficult and it's harder
to do things the not to do them.

28
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:01,600
And it's harder to do them
well than to do them badly.

29
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:02,291
You know?

30
00:01:02,291 --> 00:01:04,390
And it's easy to sit
around and be hopeless.

31
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:07,030
I don't mean it's emotionally
easy because it's not,

32
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:09,100
but it's procedural,

33
00:01:09,101 --> 00:01:10,600
easy to be useless.

34
00:01:10,601 --> 00:01:14,950
And to fall back into your old habits
and to not discipline yourself.

35
00:01:14,951 --> 00:01:18,160
And it's a matter of continual practice,

36
00:01:18,161 --> 00:01:19,720
slow continual practice.

37
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:23,530
And I think a good example of that
is something like weightlifting.

38
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:23,801
You know,

39
00:01:23,801 --> 00:01:25,360
if you start a weightlifting program,

40
00:01:25,361 --> 00:01:27,440
which I would recommend
by the way because it,

41
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:31,480
it's tremendously advantageous
physically and cognitively,

42
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:34,900
you're not going to really see results
for a number of weeks and then the

43
00:01:34,901 --> 00:01:36,010
results are rather slow,

44
00:01:36,011 --> 00:01:39,880
but you can get pretty decent results
over a six month period and absolutely

45
00:01:39,881 --> 00:01:41,800
stellar results over a couple of years.

46
00:01:41,801 --> 00:01:45,040
And so you have to make
sure your timeframe is right
and not to be too hard on

47
00:01:45,041 --> 00:01:45,520
yourself.

48
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:48,910
And I did mention the
future authoring program,

49
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:49,930
um,

50
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:50,763
earlier.

51
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:55,210
And one of the things I would recommend
too is if you're having a hard time

52
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:57,310
implementing your,

53
00:01:57,820 --> 00:01:58,660
your decision,

54
00:01:58,661 --> 00:02:02,170
say you're ethical decisions that you
spend a bit more time thinking them

55
00:02:02,171 --> 00:02:04,910
through and writing them down in the
future authoring program is really helpful

56
00:02:04,911 --> 00:02:05,231
for that.

57
00:02:05,231 --> 00:02:06,550
That's why we designed it.

58
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:11,770
And so get your goal straight and
continue to practice every day.

59
00:02:11,771 --> 00:02:13,150
And if you're not succeeding,

60
00:02:13,151 --> 00:02:14,980
then make your goal slightly smaller.

61
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:15,940
You want to,

62
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:19,720
you want to make your goals large
enough so that they challenge you,

63
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,980
but small enough so that you
have a reasonable probability
of succeeding at them

64
00:02:23,981 --> 00:02:25,720
on a day to day basis.

65
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:29,380
And then you have to also understand
that if you fail on a given day,

66
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:29,651
I could,

67
00:02:29,651 --> 00:02:32,560
let's say you're trying to quit smoking
and you quit for two weeks and then you

68
00:02:32,561 --> 00:02:33,580
have a cigarette and you think,

69
00:02:33,581 --> 00:02:34,151
oh my God,

70
00:02:34,151 --> 00:02:35,110
now I've screwed it up.

71
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:35,420
I've,

72
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:36,780
I've not quitting anymore.

73
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:38,410
And you smoke a whole pack of cigarettes.

74
00:02:38,411 --> 00:02:38,771
It's like,

75
00:02:38,771 --> 00:02:39,604
well,

76
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:41,770
there's a couple of mistakes there.

77
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:42,903
And one is,

78
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:44,111
well,

79
00:02:44,111 --> 00:02:46,870
just because you had a cigarette
doesn't mean you failed.

80
00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:48,910
It just means that you had a cigarette.

81
00:02:48,911 --> 00:02:52,000
You can start stopping again the next day.

82
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:56,380
And the fact that you had one cigarette
in the last two weeks is a hell of a lot

83
00:02:56,381 --> 00:02:58,660
better than the two weeks
that you had before that.

84
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:02,350
And so you've got to be
realistically humble.

85
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:05,890
You gotta be ambitious enough in your
goals so that you're pursuing something

86
00:03:05,891 --> 00:03:08,890
that you regard as truly
meaningful and worthwhile.

87
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:09,911
You know,

88
00:03:09,911 --> 00:03:12,550
and maybe you can judge
that to some degree.

89
00:03:12,551 --> 00:03:16,090
If you think about someone you love
attempting the same thing and think about

90
00:03:16,091 --> 00:03:17,950
how you would feel if they managed it.

91
00:03:17,951 --> 00:03:19,120
And if you would feel good,

92
00:03:19,121 --> 00:03:20,770
then that's probably a good,

93
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:22,053
um,

94
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:23,950
what would you say that would be a good

95
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:29,970
evaluation strategy to use on yourself?

96
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:31,070
You,

97
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:34,770
so you want your goals to be of sufficient
nobility so that you can live with

98
00:03:34,771 --> 00:03:36,630
yourself properly if you're pursuing them,

99
00:03:36,631 --> 00:03:40,050
but you want them to be small enough so
that you have a reasonable probability

100
00:03:40,051 --> 00:03:40,861
of implementing them.

101
00:03:40,861 --> 00:03:43,200
And if your implementation,

102
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:50,120
okay,

103
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:50,953
it's good.

104
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:53,783
You can start again.

105
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:03,573
Maybe

106
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:06,780
we're back.

107
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:07,260
Yeah.

108
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:08,093
Okay guys.

109
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:09,001
Well,

110
00:05:09,001 --> 00:05:09,930
that was interesting.

111
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:15,180
The software that I use on my camera
crashed and then when I reopened it,

112
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:19,290
it told me I hadn't purchased it and
wanted me to reenter the serial number,

113
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,210
which is quite the interesting experience.

114
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:22,613
So,

115
00:05:23,730 --> 00:05:25,740
so I'm just getting my questions back up.

116
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:26,783
Um,

117
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:29,760
this three quarter person
that you see here is Julian,

118
00:05:29,761 --> 00:05:30,380
who's,

119
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:30,720
you know,

120
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,970
reasonably helpful about
these sorts of things now.

121
00:05:32,971 --> 00:05:33,804
And then

122
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:36,841
I've,

123
00:05:36,841 --> 00:05:37,110
Al,

124
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:38,670
I've almost actually
learned how to do this.

125
00:05:38,671 --> 00:05:39,151
I tell you,

126
00:05:39,151 --> 00:05:41,460
you do get slower
technologically as you get older.

127
00:05:41,461 --> 00:05:44,760
It's kind of annoying or maybe
get just fed up with it more.

128
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:45,653
It's hard to tell.

129
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:48,570
I think you probably
stupider and less patient,

130
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:52,650
and so then you justify your less pay
your stupidity by just assuming that

131
00:05:52,651 --> 00:05:53,580
you're less patient.

132
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:56,310
So anyways,

133
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:58,223
um,

134
00:05:58,890 --> 00:05:59,723
we're back.

135
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:01,463
Thanks Julian.

136
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:02,910
Okay.
