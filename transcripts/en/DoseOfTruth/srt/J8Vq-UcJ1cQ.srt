1
00:00:06,910 --> 00:00:07,790
Take down competence.

2
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:14,190
That's fundamentally the underground
motivation is to blur the line between

3
00:00:15,311 --> 00:00:16,180
competence and power.

4
00:00:16,181 --> 00:00:20,320
And then to make anyone who manifests
any competence feel as if they're doing

5
00:00:20,321 --> 00:00:22,600
nothing but manifesting tyranny.

6
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:24,340
And it's a terrible doctrine.

7
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:26,270
And I've seen it really destroyed people.

8
00:00:26,271 --> 00:00:27,250
I literally,

9
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:28,570
I've seen it destroy people.

10
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:30,490
And in what context?

11
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:31,391
Well,

12
00:00:31,391 --> 00:00:35,080
if you're punished every time you do
anything forthright and courageous and

13
00:00:35,081 --> 00:00:35,561
noble,

14
00:00:35,561 --> 00:00:36,130
buy,

15
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:40,390
buy as a consequence of accusations
of tyranny and oppression,

16
00:00:40,690 --> 00:00:43,060
then everything you do
that's good is punished.

17
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:44,770
And there's Nicha pointed out,

18
00:00:44,771 --> 00:00:46,210
if you really want to punish someone,

19
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:47,950
you punish them for their virtues,

20
00:00:47,951 --> 00:00:49,000
not for their faults.

21
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:50,260
If you really want to hurt someone,

22
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:53,170
if I punish you because you've done
something wrong and you know you've done

23
00:00:53,171 --> 00:00:54,004
something wrong,

24
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,070
you might not be happy punishment.

25
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:56,470
Well,

26
00:00:56,470 --> 00:01:00,910
but at least it sets the scales right
and that Starsky Dostoyevsky's steam in

27
00:01:00,911 --> 00:01:02,590
his great novel crime and punishment.

28
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:03,341
You know,

29
00:01:03,341 --> 00:01:03,640
where,

30
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:07,540
where the murderer actually cries out to
the heavens to be punished because it's

31
00:01:07,541 --> 00:01:10,270
the only way that he can
reestablish his humanity.

32
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:13,120
But if you really want to hurt people,

33
00:01:13,121 --> 00:01:14,680
then you punish them for their virtues.

34
00:01:14,681 --> 00:01:18,370
And we're definitely in this situation
and I think the universities have played

35
00:01:18,371 --> 00:01:23,371
a major role in this were forthright
action on the part of ambitious and

36
00:01:24,341 --> 00:01:28,120
productive individuals is confused
with tyrannical oppression.

37
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:32,860
And a lot of that's a consequence of
the disturbed relationships between,

38
00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:38,370
well many of the people who take that
tack in the social activist domains in

39
00:01:38,591 --> 00:01:42,370
universities and have never had a
healthy relationship with someone who

40
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,233
masculine.

41
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:46,870
And so they feel that
masculinity and itself is toxic,

42
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:47,853
which is that's,

43
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:51,760
that's what I was going to ask you next
because the first video that really

44
00:01:51,761 --> 00:01:52,594
hooked me,

45
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:53,830
it spoke to me personally,

46
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:58,420
both as a new father at the
time and perhaps also as a,

47
00:01:58,421 --> 00:02:00,040
as a song of a deceased father.

48
00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:00,370
Uh,

49
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:04,810
it was where you were talking about the
relationship one has with his father.

50
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:05,920
Um,

51
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,750
can you please elaborate
a little bit on that?

52
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:08,351
Well,

53
00:02:08,351 --> 00:02:11,080
the proper role of a father
and a mother as well,

54
00:02:11,081 --> 00:02:12,760
although the roles aren't identical.

55
00:02:12,761 --> 00:02:13,430
I would say the,

56
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:17,200
the proper fundamental maternal
role is one of protection.

57
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:22,980
And the reason for that is quite obvious
is that newborn infants need above all

58
00:02:23,621 --> 00:02:24,580
to be protected.

59
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:27,850
The proper response to
an infant's distress is,

60
00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:30,610
you're right and I'll take
care of you right now,

61
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,130
especially for the first
nine months of life.

62
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:35,770
There's no disputing that
whenever the infant is upset,

63
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:40,240
he or she needs to be dealt with
as if that upset is justified.

64
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:42,040
But then as the infant matures,

65
00:02:42,041 --> 00:02:43,540
and even by the age of nine months,

66
00:02:43,541 --> 00:02:46,390
I would say then that that has to be,

67
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:47,330
that,

68
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:51,970
that that interaction has to be made more
sophisticated because the child has to

69
00:02:51,971 --> 00:02:54,700
be encouraged to take his
or her place in the world.

70
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:59,700
And I would say that encouragement
is more on the masculine side of the,

71
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:02,013
of the,

72
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,700
of the duty distribution.

73
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:09,270
And their father's fundamental role is
to produce a bounded environment in which

74
00:03:10,481 --> 00:03:15,481
exploration can take place with an eye
towards the encouragement of the child to

75
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:19,570
develop more and more competence
to push that development.

76
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:20,380
Because,

77
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:25,380
and it's true for mothers and fathers
that the end goal is to produce a person

78
00:03:25,931 --> 00:03:28,300
who's capable of operating
autonomously in the world.

79
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:33,720
Now father's role is to foster that
sense of confident autonomy by by

80
00:03:36,490 --> 00:03:41,490
encouraging the child to push his or her
limits and like that role can be played

81
00:03:41,981 --> 00:03:44,710
by mother or father if
it's a masculine role.

82
00:03:44,711 --> 00:03:46,720
It doesn't have to be played by a man,

83
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:48,010
but it's,

84
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:50,080
it's still tilts in that direction.

85
00:03:50,081 --> 00:03:51,010
And so for example,

86
00:03:51,011 --> 00:03:55,180
fathers are much more likely to engage
in rough and tumble play with their kids,

87
00:03:55,181 --> 00:03:55,961
which is very,

88
00:03:55,961 --> 00:03:57,220
very good for them by the way,

89
00:03:57,221 --> 00:04:01,180
and absolutely necessary and
something to be completely encouraged.

90
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:04,780
Rough and tumble play at is
just fooling around wrestling,

91
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:05,920
wrestling,

92
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:09,370
physical play because the kids learn
while they learn all sorts of things.

93
00:04:09,371 --> 00:04:10,960
It's like they learned to dance.

94
00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:16,060
That's the best way of thinking about
it because a confident child understands

95
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:21,090
the physics of play and you can see
this even in said simple things is going

96
00:04:21,341 --> 00:04:26,341
into a park where there's a lot of dogs
and the dogs that are well socialized

97
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:30,760
are very good at acting out playfulness
and you can tell the difference between

98
00:04:30,761 --> 00:04:34,960
a growling dog and a mean dog and
afraid and dog and a playful dog.

99
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:38,650
People are very good at making that
distinction and a playful dog knows how to

100
00:04:38,651 --> 00:04:41,800
move in a playful manner
and so does a playful child.

101
00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:47,130
And that attentive readiness to play is
something that's fostered by those play

102
00:04:47,621 --> 00:04:50,140
fight interactions with
fathers for example.

103
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:55,350
And that makes the kid ready in a deep
sense to engage with other children.

104
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,060
And it also sets the stage for a,

105
00:04:58,410 --> 00:05:00,910
for a confident physicality and out in,

106
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:03,370
in adolescents and in
sexual relationships.

107
00:05:03,371 --> 00:05:03,880
I mean,

108
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:04,350
and,

109
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:05,140
and so,

110
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:05,381
yeah,

111
00:05:05,381 --> 00:05:08,200
because a lot of our wisdom
is embodied when you,

112
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:09,700
when you wrestle with kids,

113
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:13,480
then they learn what hurts
them and what doesn't.

114
00:05:13,481 --> 00:05:16,750
They learn how far they can be
extended and stretched the limits.

115
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,960
He tests the limits they learned to trust
because you throw kids up in the air

116
00:05:19,961 --> 00:05:23,980
and you catch them and you push them to
the point where they're really excited.

117
00:05:23,981 --> 00:05:25,750
So they're right on the edge of fear.

118
00:05:25,751 --> 00:05:26,201
Actually.

119
00:05:26,201 --> 00:05:30,640
The excitement pushes right to the edge
of fear and but they learn and then they

120
00:05:30,641 --> 00:05:34,600
also learn how they can interact with
someone else physically and what's

121
00:05:34,601 --> 00:05:36,940
acceptable and where
the limits of pain are.

122
00:05:36,941 --> 00:05:41,050
And what's frightening and what can be
sustained and how to take turns and all

123
00:05:41,051 --> 00:05:41,410
of that.

124
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:42,040
And that's,

125
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,240
it's not abstract,

126
00:05:43,241 --> 00:05:43,931
it's concrete.

127
00:05:43,931 --> 00:05:45,070
It's right in the body.

128
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:46,293
And so,

129
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:48,130
so that's part of the father's role.

130
00:05:48,131 --> 00:05:51,130
But the fundamental paternal
role is that of encouragement.

131
00:05:51,131 --> 00:05:56,110
And the encouragement is you
can handle it kid life is hard.

132
00:05:56,111 --> 00:05:57,830
It's going to come at you
and all sorts of ways.

133
00:05:57,831 --> 00:05:59,360
You can accept that as a challenge.

134
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:00,440
You can thrive,

135
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:03,230
you can master it and I'm behind you.

136
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:06,980
Like I'm behind the best in you
manifesting itself in the world.

137
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:09,380
And that gives a kid a spine,

138
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,160
you know,

139
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,020
metaphysically and physic.

140
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:14,810
And so it's an unbelievably
important thing to do.

141
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:17,060
And fatherlessness is a catastrophe.

142
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:20,720
If you look at the
epidemiological literature,

143
00:06:20,721 --> 00:06:22,220
the psychological literature,

144
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:25,520
fatherlessness predicts all
sorts of terrible outcomes.

145
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:26,510
It's not good.

146
00:06:26,511 --> 00:06:30,950
And we've fallen into this idea in our
society that fathers aren't necessary.

147
00:06:30,951 --> 00:06:31,580
It's like,

148
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:36,320
and it's just a family that's run by
single mother is just as good in in the

149
00:06:36,321 --> 00:06:38,390
broad sense as a family with two parents.

150
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:40,280
And it's simply not true.

151
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:42,110
All the evidence suggests.

152
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:42,530
Now,

153
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:46,760
that doesn't mean that there aren't
single parents who were notably raising

154
00:06:46,761 --> 00:06:48,230
their children because there are,

155
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:49,490
but in the aggregate,

156
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:53,270
the two parent family is a much
better arrangement for children.

157
00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:54,390
She said that,

158
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:54,730
uh,

159
00:06:54,730 --> 00:06:56,300
without the encoder Smith off the father,

160
00:06:56,650 --> 00:07:01,650
is this as if it's spirit will be left
outside the walls of civilization?

161
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:03,230
Yes,

162
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:03,890
that's exactly,

163
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:05,330
that's exactly it is that,

164
00:07:05,331 --> 00:07:05,601
you know,

165
00:07:05,601 --> 00:07:07,010
the father's role is to,

166
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:08,443
to,

167
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:13,510
to note that the individual is capable
of thriving in a difficult world and to

168
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:16,730
put that message forward and to,

169
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:21,110
and to note that that's been the
message of people who've been successful

170
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:26,000
throughout history and that each
individual is capable of doing that,

171
00:07:26,001 --> 00:07:29,180
at least to some degree
and has no better bet.

172
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:29,631
That's the,

173
00:07:29,631 --> 00:07:30,890
as no better alternative.
