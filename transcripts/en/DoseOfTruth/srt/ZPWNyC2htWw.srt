1
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:10,570
I think it was the Ernstein Herrnstein
and Murray I think did the calculations

2
00:00:10,571 --> 00:00:15,220
back in the bell curve that indicated
that if you imagine that you could,

3
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:20,750
you are a fairy godmother and you have
your newborn grandchild in front of you

4
00:00:20,771 --> 00:00:25,420
and you can grant them three
standard deviations above the mean,

5
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:26,470
um,

6
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:28,210
in terms of wealth at birth.

7
00:00:28,211 --> 00:00:32,860
Or you can grant them three
standard deviations above
the mean in terms of Iq at

8
00:00:32,861 --> 00:00:33,694
birth.

9
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:37,330
And then you want it to determine which
would work better for them by the time

10
00:00:37,331 --> 00:00:38,141
they were 40.

11
00:00:38,141 --> 00:00:42,620
And the answer to that was quite clear
is that Iq Trump's wealth to right,

12
00:00:43,130 --> 00:00:45,340
it'd be able to predict a positive future.

13
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:51,180
So that's why I'm so interested in the
concept of increasing Iq or increasing

14
00:00:55,330 --> 00:00:56,350
the g factor,

15
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:57,760
not just the Iq score,

16
00:00:57,761 --> 00:01:00,250
but really what under
this reasoning ability.

17
00:01:00,610 --> 00:01:01,061
So you know,

18
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:04,720
some people have tried to teach
college students critical thinking.

19
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:05,530
Yeah,

20
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:06,790
I think that's a good thing.

21
00:01:08,050 --> 00:01:10,750
You can get it and you can think
critically so much the better.

22
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:12,310
Exactly.

23
00:01:12,311 --> 00:01:13,090
You know,

24
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:13,541
and you know,

25
00:01:13,541 --> 00:01:14,950
it may sound to your listeners,

26
00:01:14,951 --> 00:01:16,510
I just want to take a moment out here.

27
00:01:16,511 --> 00:01:17,760
It may sound to your listener,

28
00:01:17,761 --> 00:01:18,330
it's like,

29
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:21,790
here are these two guys pontificating
about what it's like to be smart,

30
00:01:21,791 --> 00:01:23,380
what it's like to be not so smart.

31
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:24,370
I mean,

32
00:01:24,370 --> 00:01:25,630
the point of this,

33
00:01:25,631 --> 00:01:28,540
the point of neuro science research,

34
00:01:28,541 --> 00:01:29,410
all intelligence.

35
00:01:29,411 --> 00:01:34,411
So what I hope to achieve by writing the
book was to show that that the genetic

36
00:01:34,931 --> 00:01:37,060
aspects are not deterministic.

37
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:39,160
It's the opposite.

38
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:41,590
So our probabilistic,

39
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:45,670
so the extent to which something
like an intelligence is genetic,

40
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:46,750
in my view,

41
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:51,110
is the extent to which we'll learn
how to change it for the battery.

42
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:52,140
Yeah.

43
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:56,450
Because people do tend to think about
biological factors is deterministic and

44
00:01:56,451 --> 00:01:58,830
that that's a mistake
because they can be shifted.
