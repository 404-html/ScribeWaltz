1
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:13,450
Your advice is there they
are kind of fatherly.

2
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:17,560
Is that something that comes with the
territory of being a psychologist or is

3
00:00:17,561 --> 00:00:18,780
this your wife would say?

4
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:20,111
Well it's both.

5
00:00:20,111 --> 00:00:23,980
Both being a professor at least in
principle and being at psychologist,

6
00:00:23,981 --> 00:00:25,030
a clinical psychologist.

7
00:00:25,031 --> 00:00:27,640
So I'm at a hybrid of those two things.

8
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:31,120
And I was also trained like I've read,

9
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:32,353
um,

10
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:34,720
deeply in the clinical literature,

11
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:35,620
psychoanalytic,

12
00:00:35,621 --> 00:00:37,000
existential humanist,

13
00:00:37,001 --> 00:00:39,640
there's all sorts of different
streams of clinical thinking,

14
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:43,570
all of which have something
very valuable to offer,

15
00:00:43,571 --> 00:00:44,404
I would say.

16
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:49,180
But I was trained technically
as a behavioral psychologist
and one of the things

17
00:00:49,181 --> 00:00:54,181
that are behavioral psychologist
is trained to do is to
take a large problem and

18
00:00:54,341 --> 00:00:58,570
to break it down into units that
are small enough to actually manage

19
00:00:58,600 --> 00:00:59,433
practically.

20
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:04,390
And so I've always considered my teaching
in that light is my goal is to take

21
00:01:04,391 --> 00:01:08,680
high level abstractions and to break
them down until they're practically

22
00:01:08,681 --> 00:01:09,514
applicable.

23
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:11,580
And so I suppose so that,

24
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:12,370
that's,

25
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:14,200
that's both educational.

26
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:18,940
So that's the professorial side
and psychologically meaningful.

27
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:22,770
So that's the clinical psychology side
because clinical psychologists fortify

28
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:23,621
the individual,

29
00:01:23,621 --> 00:01:24,730
that's really their role.

30
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:27,640
And to the degree that
that's a fatherly role?

31
00:01:27,641 --> 00:01:31,360
Well partly that's a consequence of
the fact that I have been a father.

32
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:34,060
I still am and that um,

33
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:38,770
I'm of the age where that's an appropriate
way of interacting with people,

34
00:01:39,010 --> 00:01:43,750
but it's also in the same
category in some sense as like,

35
00:01:43,751 --> 00:01:48,751
because the purpose of a
father psychologically is to
fortify the courage of his

36
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:50,973
children.

37
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:55,870
And so that's appropriate for me given
the stage of the development of my

38
00:01:55,871 --> 00:01:56,291
career.

39
00:01:56,291 --> 00:01:57,124
For example,

40
00:01:57,380 --> 00:02:02,380
you talked about the importance for people
to sort out early on where they want

41
00:02:03,761 --> 00:02:04,594
to go with their life.

42
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:07,060
Why is this important?

43
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:07,811
Yeah,

44
00:02:07,811 --> 00:02:10,390
well we've done some
practical work on this too.

45
00:02:10,390 --> 00:02:12,850
I have this program
called future authoring,

46
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:17,740
which is part of the self authoring suite
and it's available to everyone online.

47
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:22,800
I developed with my colleagues about 15
years ago and our goal was to produce

48
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:28,200
high quality psychological interventions
for mass audiences at an extremely low

49
00:02:29,171 --> 00:02:34,000
cost and to do it in a way that was least
likely to cause negative consequences.

50
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:39,180
So that was the framework and the futuring
future authoring program helps people

51
00:02:39,281 --> 00:02:40,810
develop a vision for their life.

52
00:02:40,811 --> 00:02:45,811
And so you're asked to imagine that you
were taking care of yourself properly,

53
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,550
so you're taking
responsibility for yourself,

54
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:53,770
not taking the easy way out or or being
nice to yourself or bolstering your self

55
00:02:53,771 --> 00:02:54,790
esteem or any of that,

56
00:02:54,791 --> 00:02:59,791
but taking responsibility for your life
and that and envision who you could be

57
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:05,410
if you could be who you should be
three to five years down the road.

58
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:06,460
Just to ask yourself,

59
00:03:06,461 --> 00:03:06,641
well,

60
00:03:06,641 --> 00:03:10,570
if I could have what I wanted and
needed and if I was acting in the world

61
00:03:10,571 --> 00:03:11,404
properly,

62
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:13,390
what would my friendships look like?

63
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:15,310
What would my intimate
relationship look like?

64
00:03:15,311 --> 00:03:18,190
How would I conduct myself
with regards to my family?

65
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:20,410
I've had lots of people
come to my talks and say,

66
00:03:20,411 --> 00:03:20,651
look,

67
00:03:20,651 --> 00:03:22,600
I've really been trying
to put together my family.

68
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:24,040
We were fragmented badly,

69
00:03:24,041 --> 00:03:27,580
and so I've been working for two years
to bring everyone together and it's

70
00:03:27,581 --> 00:03:28,420
really working.

71
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:30,190
It's like people tell
me that all the time,

72
00:03:30,191 --> 00:03:31,480
which is lovely thing to hear.

73
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:32,890
What?

74
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:34,450
How should you construct your career?

75
00:03:34,451 --> 00:03:35,830
How should you educate yourself,

76
00:03:35,831 --> 00:03:38,260
how you should resist temptation,

77
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:40,240
the temptation of drugs and alcohol.

78
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:42,280
Take care of yourself
mentally and physically.

79
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:46,450
Just have an image of if the
world could be set up around you,

80
00:03:46,451 --> 00:03:50,230
starting with you in a way that would
be best for you and for other people as

81
00:03:50,231 --> 00:03:50,710
well,

82
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:52,180
what would that look like?

83
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:54,130
What without that sort of vision,

84
00:03:54,131 --> 00:03:56,860
you don't have a target and
you don't have any hope.

85
00:03:57,100 --> 00:04:00,760
And like people live on hope
and your aim gives you hope.

86
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:03,130
And so the nobler your aim,

87
00:04:03,131 --> 00:04:04,960
the more hope you have and you need hope,

88
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:06,970
especially during times of catastrophe.

89
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:11,830
And so it's extremely necessary for
people to consider their character

90
00:04:11,831 --> 00:04:16,360
development because that's actually what
sustains them through the difficulties

91
00:04:16,361 --> 00:04:17,194
of life.

92
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,400
And it seems as if we've,

93
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:23,320
we've either never knew this in our
education system or have forgotten it

94
00:04:23,321 --> 00:04:27,370
completely and we can't forget that
because that's actually the purpose of

95
00:04:27,371 --> 00:04:27,971
education.

96
00:04:27,971 --> 00:04:30,580
The purpose of education is
the development of character.

97
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:31,653
It's not the,

98
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:34,150
it's not mastery over a set of facts.

99
00:04:34,151 --> 00:04:36,460
Even though there's some
utility in that mastery,

100
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:38,290
if the facts are dead,

101
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:43,830
if they're just lying there and they're
not given life by being integrated into

102
00:04:44,111 --> 00:04:44,620
a,

103
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:45,910
a noble narrative,

104
00:04:45,911 --> 00:04:46,421
let's say,

105
00:04:46,421 --> 00:04:47,770
then there of no utility,

106
00:04:47,771 --> 00:04:49,030
they might even be harmful.

107
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:50,051
So,

108
00:04:50,051 --> 00:04:51,460
and we've done research,

109
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:52,240
um,

110
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:55,090
if university students do
the future authoring program,

111
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:59,980
it decreases the probability they'll
drop out of school by about 30%.

112
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:05,100
And it seems to have a particularly
large effect on under achieving men.

113
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:09,580
And we're not sure
exactly why that gender,

114
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:10,270
uh,

115
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:11,230
differential exist.

116
00:05:11,231 --> 00:05:16,000
But it might partly be because in the
main women are outperforming men in

117
00:05:16,001 --> 00:05:17,110
academic environments.

118
00:05:17,111 --> 00:05:21,970
And so these programs seem to boost
the performance of the lower lower

119
00:05:21,971 --> 00:05:22,804
performers.

120
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:27,700
But it also might be that
men in particular won't
engage in the world properly

121
00:05:27,701 --> 00:05:29,410
unless they have their own aims.

122
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:30,340
Yeah.

123
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:31,270
I was almost going to ask,

124
00:05:31,271 --> 00:05:34,730
why do you think men are until
achieving or not living up to?

125
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:35,161
I think,

126
00:05:35,161 --> 00:05:35,710
I think,

127
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:36,011
well,

128
00:05:36,011 --> 00:05:37,560
I think part of it is the,

129
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:42,610
the contamination of competence with
tyranny is that if every time you turn

130
00:05:42,611 --> 00:05:43,270
around,

131
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:45,430
when you're attempting
to win a competition,

132
00:05:45,431 --> 00:05:46,091
for example,

133
00:05:46,091 --> 00:05:47,470
or take your place in the world,

134
00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:52,770
the implicit or explicit accusation
is that you're exercising tyranny and

135
00:05:53,411 --> 00:05:55,990
participating in an oppressive patriarchy.

136
00:05:56,170 --> 00:05:58,640
And there's something wrong
with you ethically for doing so.

137
00:05:58,790 --> 00:05:59,630
It's hardly,

138
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:03,440
it's an invitation to the weak part
of your character to take over.

139
00:06:03,441 --> 00:06:03,770
It's like,

140
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:04,190
well,

141
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:08,870
why should I try to do
anything when everything I do
is criticized and when I'm,

142
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:09,581
when I'm regarded?

143
00:06:09,581 --> 00:06:09,811
And,

144
00:06:09,811 --> 00:06:11,270
and it's not only that,

145
00:06:11,271 --> 00:06:16,271
because like I've met many men who really
believed that their ambitions to take

146
00:06:17,871 --> 00:06:21,770
their place in the world are part of
the oppressive patriarchal structure.

147
00:06:21,771 --> 00:06:22,490
That's,

148
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:23,240
that's,

149
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:25,100
that's responsible for,

150
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:29,270
for the dispossession of the
dispossessed and the destruction of the,

151
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:31,070
of the ecological landscape.

152
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:34,790
And that their best bet was just to do
nothing just to sit there and do nothing

153
00:06:34,791 --> 00:06:38,750
because at least then they'd be
harmless as if harmlessness is the most,

154
00:06:39,170 --> 00:06:40,790
is the highest possible goal.

155
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:45,830
But if everything is oppressive power and
that's wrong than powerlessness is the

156
00:06:45,831 --> 00:06:47,180
most impressive goal,

157
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:48,740
but there's no life in that.

158
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:51,350
So I'm going to sit here and be harmless.

159
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:52,100
So like I said,

160
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:55,370
this has become a mainstream view.

161
00:06:55,371 --> 00:06:56,204
Uh,

162
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:57,410
I feel like,

163
00:06:57,530 --> 00:06:57,690
what,

164
00:06:57,690 --> 00:06:58,260
what do you think?

165
00:06:58,260 --> 00:07:01,130
This isn't the hate can old completely.

166
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:06,160
There's certainly no shortage of pressure
to make it become the mainstream will

167
00:07:06,441 --> 00:07:06,681
view.

168
00:07:06,681 --> 00:07:06,891
Well,

169
00:07:06,891 --> 00:07:11,600
this is where I think to the universities
play a terrible role because the

170
00:07:11,601 --> 00:07:15,590
universities have facilitated
the development of these
activists disciplines,

171
00:07:15,591 --> 00:07:16,401
women's studies,

172
00:07:16,401 --> 00:07:18,020
probably foremost among them.

173
00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:19,010
Um,

174
00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:20,270
but social work,

175
00:07:20,271 --> 00:07:21,260
anthropology,

176
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:22,243
often,

177
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:22,740
uh,

178
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:23,060
uh,

179
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:25,370
English literature has
become completely corrupt.

180
00:07:25,371 --> 00:07:26,990
Law is heading in that direction.

181
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,233
Um,

182
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:33,170
and you have one fifth of
social scientists identifying
themselves as Marxists,

183
00:07:33,171 --> 00:07:38,171
which I think is beyond reprehensible
given the history of Marxism and this,

184
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:39,950
this patriarchal,

185
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:40,880
uh,

186
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:41,601
what would you say?

187
00:07:41,601 --> 00:07:45,530
This conceptual scheme that insists
that Western cultures are fundamentally

188
00:07:45,531 --> 00:07:46,090
oppressive?

189
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:51,090
Patriarchies has become not only
like holy writ in the universities,

190
00:07:52,101 --> 00:07:55,670
but it's spilling out into the
mainstream with incredible rapidity.

191
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:58,520
And it's an absolutely horrible doctrine.
