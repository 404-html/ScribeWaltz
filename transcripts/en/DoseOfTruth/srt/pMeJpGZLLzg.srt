1
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:09,930
The fact that people aren't on their
knees in gratitude all the time for the

2
00:00:09,931 --> 00:00:12,330
fact that we have central
heating and air conditioning and,

3
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:15,030
and pure water and reliable food.

4
00:00:15,031 --> 00:00:15,864
It's just,

5
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:16,951
it is.

6
00:00:16,951 --> 00:00:18,540
It's absolutely unbelievable.

7
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:23,580
And then the water supply was contaminated
with cholera for heaven's sakes.

8
00:00:23,581 --> 00:00:23,970
Right?

9
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:24,840
People don't understand.

10
00:00:24,841 --> 00:00:25,020
Okay.

11
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:26,280
I've had clean water,

12
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:27,330
fresh milk,

13
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:28,290
fresh orange juice,

14
00:00:28,291 --> 00:00:29,001
all of these things.

15
00:00:29,001 --> 00:00:30,570
There's a mom and all of the time,

16
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:34,260
all the time that that
western culture is heading.

17
00:00:34,261 --> 00:00:34,500
Okay.

18
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:34,730
Become,

19
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:36,320
because we are so dependent on this,

20
00:00:36,321 --> 00:00:40,320
on this invisible infrastructure where
a heading for an absolute catastrophe,

21
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:44,460
when hardest figure out how
to paralyze the power grid,

22
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:47,880
the entire culture will be chaotic.

23
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:49,680
You'll have mobs in the street.

24
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:50,210
Okay.

25
00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:51,420
And within three days.

26
00:00:51,421 --> 00:00:51,610
Okay.

27
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:54,430
When and so suddenly the food supply
is interrupted and there's no light.

28
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:54,860
There's no,

29
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:55,890
no way to communicate.

30
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:57,050
There'll be like a robbery.

31
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:00,060
I mean that that is the way western
culture is going to collapse.

32
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:00,440
Okay.

33
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:02,050
And it won't take much just just

34
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:06,720
because we are so
interconnected and now we are.

35
00:01:06,721 --> 00:01:07,411
So it's so,

36
00:01:07,411 --> 00:01:11,460
it's so dependent on communications
and computers to the eat it.

37
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:11,730
I've,

38
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:12,220
I've,

39
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:15,150
I used to predict for years there'll be
an asteroid hitting the earth and you

40
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:16,070
have enough another

41
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:18,250
the solar flares work.

42
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:19,810
So back in,

43
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,700
this happens about once every century.

44
00:01:21,701 --> 00:01:24,850
So back about 1880 and I
don't remember the exact year,

45
00:01:24,851 --> 00:01:27,220
there was a significant
enough solar flare,

46
00:01:27,221 --> 00:01:29,440
so that produces an electromagnetic pulse,

47
00:01:29,441 --> 00:01:33,670
like a hydrogen bomb because the sun
is a hydrogen bomb and electromagnetic

48
00:01:33,671 --> 00:01:37,810
pulse will emerge from the sun and wave
across the earth and it produces huge

49
00:01:37,811 --> 00:01:39,490
spikes in electrical,

50
00:01:39,730 --> 00:01:40,211
electrical,

51
00:01:40,211 --> 00:01:43,000
current along anything that's
electronic and he'll burn them out.

52
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:47,560
It led it lip telegraph operators on
fire in the 18 hundreds and one of those

53
00:01:47,561 --> 00:01:51,100
things took out the Quebec power grid
in 1985 and knocked out the whole

54
00:01:51,101 --> 00:01:52,150
northeast corridor.

55
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:55,540
And so you figure those things
are about one in a century event,

56
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:56,703
but those single,

57
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:59,290
I have my brother in law
who's a very smart guy.

58
00:01:59,291 --> 00:02:01,360
He designed the chip and the iPhone.

59
00:02:01,361 --> 00:02:05,470
We were talking about political issues
the last time I went and saw him in San

60
00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:05,471
Francisco.

61
00:02:05,471 --> 00:02:09,350
And his notion was that all that the
government should be doing right now is

62
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,790
stress testing our infrastructure the
same way they stress test the banks

63
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:15,700
because we're so full of these
single points of failure that,

64
00:02:15,701 --> 00:02:17,050
and I think you're absolutely right.

65
00:02:17,051 --> 00:02:18,010
Luckily we've been,

66
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:18,820
um,

67
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:19,750
what would you call,

68
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:23,050
invaded by stupid terrorists
instead of smart terrorists?

69
00:02:23,051 --> 00:02:26,950
Because a smart terrorist could do an
unbelievable amount of damage in a very

70
00:02:26,951 --> 00:02:28,030
short period of time.

71
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:31,810
So when it's just God's good graces
that that hasn't happened yet.

72
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:32,830
And so,

73
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:35,590
and then what will happen
is that if the men,

74
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:41,020
the men will reconstruct civilization
while the women cower in the houses.

75
00:02:41,021 --> 00:02:43,120
And I have the men go out
and do all the dirty work.

76
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,200
That's what's going to happen again.

77
00:02:44,201 --> 00:02:45,070
Only men will,

78
00:02:45,071 --> 00:02:46,720
will bring civilization back again.

79
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:47,210
Yeah.
