1
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:10,400
Postmodern view is like the hobbs of
view in some sense,

2
00:00:10,401 --> 00:00:13,280
except you want to replace the
individual with,

3
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:15,440
with,
with pyramids of,

4
00:00:15,770 --> 00:00:19,910
of social organization,
so hierarchies of social organization

5
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:22,720
that are based on group identity,
um,

6
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:28,070
and the landscape in which those
pyramids exists is one of unbroken

7
00:00:28,071 --> 00:00:32,330
enmity and inability to communicate.
So it's a very dark view as far as I'm

8
00:00:32,331 --> 00:00:36,290
concerned and I think it's fundamentally
wrong and in many ways,

9
00:00:36,291 --> 00:00:40,130
I mean it's right in that there are
groups of people and there is some

10
00:00:40,131 --> 00:00:43,460
difficulty in communication between
them.

11
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:48,650
And that power is an element in the
formation of hierarchies,

12
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:53,710
but you can't reduce hierarchy or group
relationship to those premises.

13
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:59,690
It's too simplified because people also
cooperate.

14
00:00:59,691 --> 00:01:00,990
We're also not groups.
Men,

15
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:02,780
we,
many of us belong to many groups,

16
00:01:02,990 --> 00:01:07,990
so it's to the actual situation is far
too complex to reduce it to that degree,

17
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:11,510
to reduce it to that degree.

18
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:15,230
Even though you can come up with a good
explanatory story if you do so,

19
00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:18,980
it doesn't capture the nuances and
they're not just nuances.

20
00:01:18,981 --> 00:01:21,860
It doesn't capture the essence.
Now,

21
00:01:21,861 --> 00:01:25,400
the thing is is that when you make the
presupposition that the reason that

22
00:01:25,401 --> 00:01:30,100
hierarchies exist is because of power,
then essentially what you do is turn to

23
00:01:30,101 --> 00:01:32,360
every hierarchy into a tyranny.
And so if you,

24
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:34,520
if there is a hierarchy,
then you assume it's a tyranny.

25
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:35,930
Well,
that's really the patriarchy.

26
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:38,690
The Patriarchy is hierarchy assumed as
tyranny,

27
00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:43,160
and that's also just not true except in
pathological hierarchies.

28
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:46,760
So for example,
we know from the psychological

29
00:01:46,761 --> 00:01:49,760
literature that the best predictors of
longterm life success,

30
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:54,200
our intelligence and conscientiousness
in western countries at least.

31
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:55,670
Well,
that's what you'd hope for it,

32
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,990
right?
More or less,

33
00:01:57,310 --> 00:01:58,820
if you,
if you want to even just set up a

34
00:01:58,821 --> 00:02:01,910
society,
even if you weren't particularly smart

35
00:02:01,911 --> 00:02:05,660
or hard working,
you might want to set up a society where

36
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:08,570
intelligence and hard work,
we are good predictors of success

37
00:02:08,571 --> 00:02:11,450
because then the people who were smart
and hardworking would produce a bunch of

38
00:02:11,451 --> 00:02:14,240
things that you could have if you could
trade for them.

39
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:17,570
And of course that is actually the
situation that most of us are in.

40
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:21,650
So,
and of course the other thing about

41
00:02:21,651 --> 00:02:26,030
people who believed that hierarchies in
the West are only composed of of power

42
00:02:26,031 --> 00:02:30,770
and tyranny is that their own actions
belie that because whenever they make a

43
00:02:30,771 --> 00:02:33,320
decision to interact with that
hierarchy,

44
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:38,000
they attempt or to make a purchase or or
to make a trade,

45
00:02:38,001 --> 00:02:39,520
let's say,
or to obtain a service,

46
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:43,490
a service of any importance,
let's say a medical service,

47
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:48,840
they are going to definitely act as if
there are less and more competent people

48
00:02:49,761 --> 00:02:53,480
within that hierarchy and seek out the
ones that are more competent obviously,

49
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:56,600
which you don't do if the.
If the hierarchy is only composed of

50
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,700
tyranny and power,
there's no point looking for.

51
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:01,900
But anyways,
in the west and in functioning

52
00:03:01,901 --> 00:03:05,020
societies,
hierarchies are basically predicated on

53
00:03:05,021 --> 00:03:06,460
competence and not power.

54
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:08,770
And and you might say,
well that's pretty naive.

55
00:03:08,771 --> 00:03:09,311
It's like,
no,

56
00:03:09,311 --> 00:03:14,311
actually it's not very naive.
I'm not saying at all that inappropriate

57
00:03:14,321 --> 00:03:18,520
power plays don't play a role in
corrupting hierarchies of competence.

58
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:20,950
That happens,
but generally what happens is if the

59
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:23,950
hierarchies of competence get corrupted
enough by power,

60
00:03:23,951 --> 00:03:26,320
then they crumble because they can no
longer function.

61
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:28,620
So,
and the,

62
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:30,880
you know,
the evidence that are hierarchies of

63
00:03:30,881 --> 00:03:33,040
competence.
Work is everywhere because everything

64
00:03:33,041 --> 00:03:37,750
around us works all the time ion hers.
The two interesting stories in her book,

65
00:03:37,751 --> 00:03:39,400
infidel,
which is a great book by the way,

66
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:44,020
um,
she came from Africa and from a country

67
00:03:44,021 --> 00:03:47,350
that wasn't very functional and when she
came to Holland she said there were two

68
00:03:47,351 --> 00:03:49,610
things that really amazed her,
um,

69
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:51,370
and this really struck me because,
you know,

70
00:03:51,371 --> 00:03:53,320
now,
and then you get lucky and you can see

71
00:03:53,330 --> 00:03:56,050
the,
the world you live in from an outsider's

72
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:56,860
perspective,
right?

73
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:58,690
You get to see through someone else's
eyes.

74
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:01,570
Um,
she said the first thing that knocked

75
00:04:01,571 --> 00:04:06,571
her off her feet was waiting for a bus
and in Amsterdam and on the,

76
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:09,490
you know,
she's standing at the bus stop and

77
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:12,940
there's a pole there and there's digital
sign on the pole and the digital sign

78
00:04:12,941 --> 00:04:15,790
says when the next bus is going to come
and counts down.

79
00:04:15,791 --> 00:04:18,830
And then when it hits zero,
the bus appears and she,

80
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:19,930
she just,
she just,

81
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:22,780
she absolutely could not believe that
that would happen,

82
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:27,070
that there could be a sign that told you
when the bus would come and that it

83
00:04:27,071 --> 00:04:30,610
would change and the bus would actually
appear and you think,

84
00:04:30,611 --> 00:04:31,450
well,
yeah,

85
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:33,040
no,
that's a miracle man.

86
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:35,050
That's an absolute miracle.
It is.

87
00:04:35,051 --> 00:04:36,940
It is.
You got to think that through,

88
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:39,250
you know,
the amount of timing and organization

89
00:04:39,251 --> 00:04:39,721
and,
and,

90
00:04:39,721 --> 00:04:41,650
and,
and reliability,

91
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:46,740
mechanical reliability and sociological
or social organization and dedication on

92
00:04:47,351 --> 00:04:50,140
the part of the bus drivers and the
entire company and the Organization of

93
00:04:50,141 --> 00:04:54,130
the whole city and the state to make
that possible is absolutely beyond

94
00:04:54,131 --> 00:04:55,930
belief,
especially when it's time to,

95
00:04:56,110 --> 00:05:00,460
well perhaps not the second but to 10
seconds or something like that.

96
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:04,930
That is absolutely beyond belief and her
inability to comprehend.

97
00:05:04,931 --> 00:05:08,950
That was the correct response.
And then the other things she was amazed

98
00:05:08,951 --> 00:05:12,520
by was that you could go talk to
policemen and they would help you.

99
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:16,390
That was just,
that was just a no go for her because

100
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:19,690
for her,
her experience was policemen were there

101
00:05:19,691 --> 00:05:23,680
to shake you down and and hurt you,
and so you think,

102
00:05:23,681 --> 00:05:24,514
well,
you know,

103
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:26,170
well,
I won't.

104
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:30,380
I won't dwell on that point any longer.
The point is,

105
00:05:30,381 --> 00:05:35,381
is that it's absolutely ridiculous,
blind to make the assumption that the

106
00:05:39,101 --> 00:05:44,101
hierarchies in functioning Western
democracies are fundamentally predicated

107
00:05:44,291 --> 00:05:45,460
on power and tyranny.
