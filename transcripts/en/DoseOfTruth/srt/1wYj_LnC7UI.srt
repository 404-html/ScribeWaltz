1
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:38,910
The real is

2
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:42,240
it's showing

3
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:51,843
shows

4
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:24,463
this was

5
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:32,770
fine.

6
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:28,270
I

7
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:37,023
said,

8
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:40,080
would you be interested in hearing about

9
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:48,570
is basically the story

10
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:07,540
[inaudible]

11
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:03,670
uh,

12
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:42,283
the

13
00:08:43,850 --> 00:08:45,080
whole thing

14
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:02,083
just

15
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:44,970
as you were saying,

16
00:09:56,090 --> 00:09:59,130
but

17
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:29,430
just

18
00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:43,990
the Middle East.

19
00:11:55,270 --> 00:11:56,103
Okay.

20
00:11:56,270 --> 00:11:57,103
That's

21
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:00,493
okay.

22
00:12:02,390 --> 00:12:07,390
Because we can give
them the composition of

23
00:12:12,450 --> 00:12:14,150
each side.

24
00:12:16,890 --> 00:12:21,180
One of them accepts it,

25
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:21,970
gets rid of,

26
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:25,370
he understands that the man

27
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,810
is the same because she,

28
00:12:31,130 --> 00:12:31,963
okay.

29
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:38,373
Houston

30
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:44,100
being the case,

31
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,800
he more about

32
00:12:49,530 --> 00:12:51,280
the history of

33
00:12:58,740 --> 00:12:59,573
failed.

34
00:13:01,010 --> 00:13:03,330
So he says,

35
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:05,713
if you

36
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,070
take me off this,

37
00:13:08,071 --> 00:13:08,280
you know,

38
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:09,580
you get rid of this pain.

39
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:12,430
So

40
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:17,340
God's love taking us to taste,

41
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:20,621
you know,

42
00:13:20,621 --> 00:13:24,070
to safety hospital.

43
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:26,990
The parameters of human three,

44
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:33,580
there were a whole bunch of philosophy

45
00:13:35,150 --> 00:13:36,830
because he raises the idea of free

46
00:13:38,510 --> 00:13:39,343
will.

47
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:45,923
Yes,

48
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:52,990
you may be a way for people like
origin in the first century,

49
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:53,860
uh,

50
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:55,990
spoke about the restoration.

51
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:00,300
Eventually we'll find a way to say,

52
00:14:02,890 --> 00:14:03,723
but

53
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:06,013
the Church

54
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:10,880
and some of the 20th century people said,

55
00:14:10,881 --> 00:14:11,714
look,

56
00:14:11,770 --> 00:14:14,750
you tell the model versus God is love

57
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:32,700
because love sometimes has to anchor,

58
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:34,250
shout the,

59
00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:38,620
the wealth to community and help

60
00:14:42,330 --> 00:14:43,163
us

61
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:45,083
so much.

62
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:50,610
See someone suffering and to

63
00:14:56,850 --> 00:14:57,683
people

64
00:14:59,030 --> 00:14:59,863
were

65
00:15:30,770 --> 00:15:31,603
secondary

66
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,870
school.

67
00:17:31,030 --> 00:17:31,863
That's

68
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:37,833
I

69
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:46,183
said

70
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:18,953
to

71
00:20:23,170 --> 00:20:25,360
come up with,

72
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:49,570
he's never been

73
00:20:51,410 --> 00:20:52,340
in Wister.

74
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:58,700
Wisdom tends to focus on the
ag and now this one shows

75
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:15,220
it's a real difference

76
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:35,993
to the table.

77
00:21:41,770 --> 00:21:42,603
The table,

78
00:21:57,780 --> 00:21:58,640
well

79
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:15,380
show us what's called the pit.

80
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:26,320
It's happening

81
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:04,953
for some reason,

82
00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:12,970
angels with the flaming sword
standing in front of the garden

83
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:16,553
because

84
00:23:18,450 --> 00:23:22,930
mythical perception is mainly

85
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:25,520
a

86
00:23:28,170 --> 00:23:29,003
conversation

87
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:35,933
need

88
00:23:36,970 --> 00:23:38,680
to this deductive reasoning,

89
00:23:39,630 --> 00:23:40,520
but again,

90
00:23:45,770 --> 00:23:46,603
immediately

91
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:54,380
basically

92
00:23:57,510 --> 00:23:59,430
refers to

93
00:24:00,970 --> 00:24:05,970
the process and there's a whole refuge or

94
00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:10,580
anthropology and psychology,

95
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:12,550
clinical psychology

96
00:24:14,810 --> 00:24:19,810
over the centuries that deals with
the process by which we can purify,

97
00:24:22,330 --> 00:24:23,163
which means visual.

98
00:24:29,330 --> 00:24:31,400
You can see by saying,

99
00:24:33,230 --> 00:24:36,030
but you can see like Phil said,

100
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:45,310
c

101
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:50,420
is deeply ingrained in the human language.

102
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:52,220
You see what I mean?

103
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:57,670
Until late June

104
00:25:03,030 --> 00:25:07,610
because it was to see talks
about the eye of the soul.

105
00:25:11,030 --> 00:25:11,863
The

106
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:15,470
soul is also called Moose.

107
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:16,413
Okay.

108
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:19,580
That's the eye of the soul or spirit.

109
00:25:25,730 --> 00:25:26,563
Yes.

110
00:25:28,050 --> 00:25:28,883
He has parents

111
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:31,173
pay attention.

112
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:43,670
Somebody films and shows.

113
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:50,633
Yes.

114
00:25:53,350 --> 00:25:54,530
Why that phrase,

115
00:26:05,810 --> 00:26:06,643
contemplation.

116
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:15,880
A bunch of paintings in the house

117
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:22,040
or just speak in different
places in North America,

118
00:26:23,030 --> 00:26:23,960
standard places.

119
00:26:23,961 --> 00:26:26,850
One was in front of the year,

120
00:26:32,210 --> 00:26:36,290
he painted first of all to I
would say the sacrifice that area

121
00:26:38,350 --> 00:26:39,183
it's

122
00:26:42,190 --> 00:26:46,310
in some sense can control or at least
to give it your active director.

123
00:26:46,590 --> 00:26:50,340
And then the gays element of this problem
is trying to make it a point in the

124
00:26:50,350 --> 00:26:55,350
bay that even these day to day realities
are winning more worth paying attention

125
00:26:56,551 --> 00:26:56,721
to.

126
00:26:56,721 --> 00:26:58,560
Then you didn't think or even,

127
00:26:58,990 --> 00:27:03,990
and so he spends 40 hours is
just somewhere on his own,

128
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:08,050
but it's an injunction to

129
00:27:10,370 --> 00:27:11,203
get.

130
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:13,273
So what you think

131
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:16,170
things that are

132
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:19,410
beyond the superficial

133
00:27:26,530 --> 00:27:28,200
mum communication.

134
00:27:36,090 --> 00:27:36,923
So

135
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:45,290
the uh,

136
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:48,093
the colors,

137
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:49,573
you

138
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:53,050
positioning

139
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:00,310
this whole convention

140
00:28:16,670 --> 00:28:17,503
without

141
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:21,993
serious

142
00:28:23,530 --> 00:28:27,090
not fulfill the Ozarks division,

143
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:30,020
they close.

144
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:31,570
Then there's a huge

145
00:28:34,590 --> 00:28:39,500
transfiguration in the second Sunday

146
00:28:42,630 --> 00:28:45,110
we remember this man here.

147
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:58,800
He was magnificent theologian,

148
00:28:59,190 --> 00:28:59,460
uh,

149
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:00,480
theologian

150
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:06,690
according to the definition
of John's Damascus.

151
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:15,010
He said,

152
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:18,490
if you pray you will be a failed login.

153
00:29:20,330 --> 00:29:23,730
Now he has a theologian,

154
00:29:23,731 --> 00:29:25,110
said he,

155
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:28,700
because at that time there was a lot of

156
00:29:30,450 --> 00:29:31,640
interaction between these.

157
00:29:31,650 --> 00:29:33,150
The list in terms of fields,

158
00:29:33,151 --> 00:29:33,984
you know,

159
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:40,620
a month reading background from Calabria
came to Constantinople and begin to

160
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:47,020
share some of these scholastic,

161
00:29:47,190 --> 00:29:47,770
um,

162
00:29:47,770 --> 00:29:48,603
um,

163
00:29:49,330 --> 00:29:50,260
ideas from,

164
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:51,050
uh,

165
00:29:51,050 --> 00:29:51,883
uh,

166
00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:55,730
acquires and also from a peer

167
00:29:58,430 --> 00:29:59,830
rationalistic kind of stuff.

168
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,360
And he

169
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:09,900
formulated the traditional
eastern view that,

170
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:11,453
um,

171
00:30:11,770 --> 00:30:15,610
the grace of God is

172
00:30:18,070 --> 00:30:18,903
the aim.

173
00:30:18,930 --> 00:30:21,700
The acquisition of grace
is the aim of life.

174
00:30:21,830 --> 00:30:26,830
And actually there is a story like
that where I come from is called the

175
00:30:26,951 --> 00:30:28,510
conversation of sensor for,

176
00:30:28,511 --> 00:30:29,141
with motto,

177
00:30:29,141 --> 00:30:29,974
Viva,

178
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:30,940
uh,

179
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:34,000
concerning the meaning of

180
00:30:35,890 --> 00:30:39,880
Christian life is about
acquiring the Holy Spirit,

181
00:30:39,910 --> 00:30:40,960
the grace of God,

182
00:30:41,230 --> 00:30:41,780
okay.

183
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:42,613
Um,

184
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:46,270
it's not impersonal.

185
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:48,850
It is the Holy Spirit.

186
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:50,583
Okay.

187
00:30:50,910 --> 00:30:52,960
And that's what the life
of the church is hard.

188
00:30:54,010 --> 00:30:54,843
Okay?

189
00:30:55,090 --> 00:30:55,530
Now,

190
00:30:55,530 --> 00:30:55,810
if we,

191
00:30:55,810 --> 00:30:56,591
in our liturgy,

192
00:30:56,591 --> 00:30:57,580
we focus,

193
00:30:59,070 --> 00:31:01,330
I'll give you a
distinction between say the

194
00:31:03,310 --> 00:31:06,280
traditional understanding medieval,

195
00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:06,760
uh,

196
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:07,593
that,

197
00:31:07,630 --> 00:31:08,463
uh,

198
00:31:08,470 --> 00:31:09,370
in the Eucharist,

199
00:31:09,790 --> 00:31:13,780
the priest access Christ and he says,

200
00:31:13,810 --> 00:31:14,820
this is my body.

201
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:18,670
This is my blood out of
the day of the key words.

202
00:31:19,570 --> 00:31:23,710
Whereas your narrow
understanding the priest,

203
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:25,390
the priest is a

204
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:28,060
real person is Christ

205
00:31:31,090 --> 00:31:33,580
does this through the Holy Spirit.

206
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:35,133
But,

207
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:35,650
um,

208
00:31:35,650 --> 00:31:36,301
so the,

209
00:31:36,301 --> 00:31:40,870
the prayers or the risk to love
the file to send his Holy Spirit

210
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:44,750
on us along the gifts.

211
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:45,761
Okay,

212
00:31:45,761 --> 00:31:50,761
so that's what that is
to divinization or feels

213
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:58,200
so that he is

214
00:32:00,030 --> 00:32:01,360
the Christian.

215
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:03,030
Okay.

216
00:32:03,030 --> 00:32:03,520
Otherwise,

217
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:05,520
we're kind of not realizing our potential,

218
00:32:07,090 --> 00:32:08,410
not potential.

219
00:32:08,950 --> 00:32:11,150
God has given us so much
and they're not using it.

220
00:32:11,780 --> 00:32:12,910
When you were saying why,

221
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:13,840
why,

222
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:14,770
why do we lazy?

223
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:16,193
Because,

224
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,610
because why?

225
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:20,190
Because the

226
00:32:22,930 --> 00:32:25,370
what's called the lure of seeing normous.

227
00:32:25,390 --> 00:32:29,450
These are my peers as Saint Paul
writes is like the force of that.

228
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:30,940
It feels like

229
00:32:33,550 --> 00:32:34,383
I talked about that.

230
00:32:34,890 --> 00:32:35,740
Yeah,

231
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:36,713
that's fine.

232
00:32:39,530 --> 00:32:40,280
No,

233
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:41,113
but I've seen him.

234
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:42,073
Youtube,

235
00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:50,150
my son Ross is a big

236
00:32:51,750 --> 00:32:52,583
fan.

237
00:33:11,510 --> 00:33:12,440
That isn't the case.

238
00:33:13,350 --> 00:33:14,183
What do I know?

239
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:19,033
It's,

240
00:33:19,910 --> 00:33:21,930
I'll give you a quotation from the,

241
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:22,661
the fees,

242
00:33:22,661 --> 00:33:23,494
the fees,

243
00:33:24,110 --> 00:33:26,700
the pesto ration or some job was awesome.

244
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:29,210
Qcs intentions,

245
00:33:29,390 --> 00:33:30,223
good intentions.

246
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:32,490
You have

247
00:33:44,190 --> 00:33:45,480
this beautiful place.

248
00:33:57,070 --> 00:33:59,690
I realize that so many people want to

249
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:02,373
know,

250
00:34:03,810 --> 00:34:04,820
should I be taking,

251
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:17,033
okay.

252
00:34:19,110 --> 00:34:22,200
Another question for you
and I don't understand it.

253
00:34:22,390 --> 00:34:22,641
All right,

254
00:34:22,641 --> 00:34:24,250
so it's easier to go down the hill.

255
00:34:24,380 --> 00:34:25,213
Fair enough.

256
00:34:25,290 --> 00:34:26,180
That's that's,

257
00:34:30,170 --> 00:34:30,621
and there's,

258
00:34:30,621 --> 00:34:33,480
there's some delight in bitterness
of going down the hill too.

259
00:34:34,070 --> 00:34:37,030
So it's not just easy shows
that there's terrible.

260
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:37,873
The trach

261
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:42,413
and the,

262
00:34:43,010 --> 00:34:44,510
obviously there's a lot.

263
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:46,433
So you're here.

264
00:34:46,580 --> 00:34:47,413
Here's the idea.

265
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:50,870
I had this strange idea two weeks ago,

266
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:51,561
three weeks ago,

267
00:34:51,561 --> 00:34:52,400
something like that.

268
00:34:53,070 --> 00:34:58,070
So I was trying to reconcile it with the
idea that I think this is more Western

269
00:34:58,130 --> 00:34:58,963
Christian idea thing.

270
00:34:59,460 --> 00:34:59,850
You know,

271
00:34:59,850 --> 00:35:03,800
people are already human
beings on the face of Christ.

272
00:35:07,490 --> 00:35:09,620
I suppose that they don't,

273
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:12,560
that seems to be a problem.

274
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:15,600
I'm going to tell him that and say

275
00:35:18,990 --> 00:35:19,900
that's the question.

276
00:35:19,901 --> 00:35:20,510
The question.

277
00:35:20,510 --> 00:35:21,110
So here's,

278
00:35:21,110 --> 00:35:22,170
here's the thought of that.

279
00:35:22,190 --> 00:35:23,510
Of course that's true,

280
00:35:23,511 --> 00:35:25,070
but we still have to be the work.

281
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:26,570
Guess what?

282
00:35:26,570 --> 00:35:27,403
That's a very strict,

283
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:29,160
you have to think about the same time.

284
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:30,800
Maybe that's the conjunction.

285
00:35:30,870 --> 00:35:31,703
We determined

286
00:35:34,030 --> 00:35:35,700
that the nation is

287
00:35:38,610 --> 00:35:39,540
my senior counselor,

288
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:40,740
uh,

289
00:35:41,050 --> 00:35:43,140
beginning of the fourth century.

290
00:35:45,740 --> 00:35:46,860
He says things like,

291
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:50,370
God cannot say you without you.

292
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:56,800
Now is that sticking point
of interpretation between
the Eastern and the Western

293
00:35:57,271 --> 00:35:57,960
church?

294
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:59,190
Because it seems to me,

295
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:00,840
I mean it seems paradoxical,

296
00:36:01,250 --> 00:36:03,040
both in Catholicism and the pastor.

297
00:36:04,050 --> 00:36:07,650
Most of the activity seems to be
taking place on the part of God.

298
00:36:07,950 --> 00:36:08,101
Well,

299
00:36:08,101 --> 00:36:12,450
that's because you always want
somebody else to do with him,

300
00:36:13,910 --> 00:36:14,600
right?

301
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:14,881
God,

302
00:36:14,881 --> 00:36:15,560
you'll do.

303
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:15,890
Right.

304
00:36:15,890 --> 00:36:16,690
Okay.

305
00:36:16,690 --> 00:36:20,730
I'll say I pray to be
on the basis of hitches,

306
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:22,410
criticism up the Western church.

307
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:23,393
That's right.

308
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:24,613
There's this,

309
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:25,573
um,

310
00:36:26,850 --> 00:36:27,710
where's my implement,

311
00:36:27,870 --> 00:36:28,410
right?

312
00:36:28,410 --> 00:36:32,400
How can I feel the have
become a human limb?

313
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:35,820
One idea that is d in

314
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:41,280
anthropology is that we have
yet to become human beings.

315
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:42,000
You know,

316
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,020
when policies,

317
00:36:43,430 --> 00:36:47,120
behold a man that he is
the first film for me.

318
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:50,560
Right?

319
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:55,510
Then those kinds of things
around the way to do that.

320
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:56,660
You think that's what you wrote,

321
00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:00,570
that's what you wrote.

322
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:01,613
That

323
00:37:03,220 --> 00:37:04,990
same division tuition.

324
00:37:09,870 --> 00:37:10,703
It's a very strong

325
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,360
synergy

326
00:37:18,190 --> 00:37:20,270
versus a presence of sinners.

327
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:21,173
You

328
00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:24,360
give me an African divine

329
00:37:26,190 --> 00:37:27,940
and the human difference is real.

330
00:37:28,350 --> 00:37:29,220
It's real.

331
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:30,300
It's what's written.

332
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,860
Otherwise it can't make sense of history.

333
00:37:34,910 --> 00:37:35,743
Right?

334
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:37,473
Right.

335
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:40,193
Um,

336
00:37:43,850 --> 00:37:46,120
as we see people suffering,

337
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:50,910
and thank God he sent me a real simple,

338
00:37:51,030 --> 00:37:51,930
I know

339
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,140
chemotherapy and stuff like that.

340
00:37:59,830 --> 00:38:00,663
Um,

341
00:38:02,490 --> 00:38:04,350
that use you on insulin

342
00:38:07,070 --> 00:38:07,903
except

343
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:12,480
you wouldn't think that would be
good site you would get from it.

344
00:38:13,850 --> 00:38:16,870
But I guess the alternative to
that inside this to become biff,

345
00:38:17,890 --> 00:38:21,240
it looks like to me
and that's not helpful.

346
00:38:22,010 --> 00:38:22,843
You have,

347
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:25,230
you have to understand that

348
00:38:26,970 --> 00:38:27,211
you,

349
00:38:27,211 --> 00:38:28,044
I mean

350
00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:32,190
that

351
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:35,603
all

352
00:38:43,250 --> 00:38:44,780
the clothes,

353
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:47,110
there's a big teacher.

354
00:38:47,510 --> 00:38:48,470
How much is ego?

355
00:38:50,250 --> 00:38:51,083
Hello?

356
00:38:54,220 --> 00:38:56,080
That tall.

357
00:38:56,140 --> 00:39:01,140
He's mainly about the attempt of
human beings to self assertive.

358
00:39:02,290 --> 00:39:03,640
That's called crime.

359
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:06,720
You know crime is the,

360
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:10,180
just to assert yourself over.

361
00:39:10,181 --> 00:39:13,120
Other people know this is

362
00:39:16,070 --> 00:39:21,070
sort of non religious people talk
about no self worth self esteem.

363
00:39:24,730 --> 00:39:27,160
That's when I feel great about myself.

364
00:39:27,790 --> 00:39:30,930
But if you throw the way
to say I feel bad about it,

365
00:39:30,931 --> 00:39:34,570
go then say I don't care.

366
00:39:34,930 --> 00:39:37,980
I can do anything right
because it's not me doing it.

367
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:40,480
I don't have to stress out what I do,

368
00:39:40,540 --> 00:39:41,373
what I say,

369
00:39:44,110 --> 00:39:45,310
but he's chosen

370
00:39:47,170 --> 00:39:48,060
Les Pauls.

371
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:50,433
Why?

372
00:39:51,070 --> 00:39:51,940
Because he loves us.

373
00:39:52,950 --> 00:39:54,670
Seems a strange way to get things done.

374
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:07,280
How many people come here?

375
00:40:07,860 --> 00:40:08,693
It varies.

376
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:11,240
They all trouble.

377
00:40:15,390 --> 00:40:16,223
Is

378
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:19,353
the

379
00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:25,860
Anglican Priest told you that the church
being the C O v stands for Christmas at

380
00:40:26,550 --> 00:40:27,383
least.

381
00:40:30,450 --> 00:40:30,790
Well,

382
00:40:30,790 --> 00:40:31,010
right.

383
00:40:31,010 --> 00:40:32,550
They're really sort of did my job.

384
00:40:33,950 --> 00:40:35,430
It's this effect of life.

385
00:40:37,270 --> 00:40:39,940
The church has always been
a semester and that's okay

386
00:40:43,210 --> 00:40:44,080
on a Sunday,

387
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:59,700
which is not very much these figures here

388
00:41:07,150 --> 00:41:08,560
on a visa.

389
00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:11,613
That's the

390
00:41:15,450 --> 00:41:16,750
social voice

391
00:41:22,710 --> 00:41:23,580
is actually taking

392
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:27,880
leaves of assaults.

393
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:36,800
Yeah,

394
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:37,210
they did.

395
00:41:37,210 --> 00:41:38,043
They uh,

396
00:41:38,340 --> 00:41:41,030
what the level of the land

397
00:41:53,750 --> 00:41:55,340
this is the actual

398
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:29,840
human beings don't have to be perfect.

399
00:42:29,950 --> 00:42:30,783
Right.

400
00:42:31,130 --> 00:42:32,630
You can go

401
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:35,473
to fictions.

402
00:42:41,620 --> 00:42:42,453
Lots of papers.

403
00:42:48,890 --> 00:42:50,720
That trajectory was the critical issue.

404
00:42:54,810 --> 00:42:56,940
That's good.

405
00:43:01,050 --> 00:43:04,600
What do you think of the revitalization
of Christianity in Russia?

406
00:43:09,330 --> 00:43:10,163
It

407
00:43:11,050 --> 00:43:11,900
is real.

408
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:17,790
It's going through a process of
system because when the first

409
00:43:20,330 --> 00:43:23,480
four just before the full

410
00:43:27,810 --> 00:43:29,190
became fashionable as well,

411
00:43:30,170 --> 00:43:32,360
because the church was cursing,

412
00:43:35,270 --> 00:43:37,710
people just did it for the wrong reasons.

413
00:43:39,100 --> 00:43:44,100
I appreciate Christianity was a legal
is made into the state religion,

414
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:50,080
the great

415
00:43:52,570 --> 00:43:53,610
general life.

416
00:43:56,310 --> 00:43:58,880
So there's a lot of people

417
00:44:00,470 --> 00:44:01,830
came to church for the wrong reason.

418
00:44:04,370 --> 00:44:08,120
Eventually things change.

419
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:12,770
What do you think about goodness
relationship with the church?

420
00:44:12,771 --> 00:44:14,750
Do you think there's anything
about that that's real?

421
00:44:17,620 --> 00:44:18,490
Well,

422
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:22,250
if one were to be completely and it say,

423
00:44:22,251 --> 00:44:24,860
well he's a really shrewd politician,

424
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:28,730
understands that the churches
are a real source of power.

425
00:44:30,020 --> 00:44:32,130
You've got to be the right side

426
00:44:32,130 --> 00:44:32,963
of the church.

427
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:39,300
Burned them all down.

428
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:41,340
Exactly.

429
00:44:41,340 --> 00:44:42,530
How much did Constantine,

430
00:44:43,710 --> 00:44:48,710
when he decided to kind of
see as well with the church,

431
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:54,810
he didn't make me want to
get baptized until he's dead.

432
00:44:57,340 --> 00:44:58,590
He saw,

433
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:04,753
uh,

434
00:45:26,770 --> 00:45:29,340
so as a matter of fact,

435
00:45:55,890 --> 00:45:56,723
yes

436
00:46:02,310 --> 00:46:03,410
we should talk to them all.

437
00:46:03,420 --> 00:46:03,780
She was,

438
00:46:03,780 --> 00:46:08,780
it was it kind of like a pagan reaction
against Christianity and against the

439
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:11,433
West Deans

440
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:14,513
was

441
00:46:17,700 --> 00:46:18,533
Christianity

442
00:46:23,590 --> 00:46:27,540
and also during the cultural revolution
because then we live just the full

443
00:46:27,560 --> 00:46:28,890
peripheral Gushi again.

444
00:46:29,700 --> 00:46:30,720
But some of

445
00:46:37,390 --> 00:46:42,390
the kids have a fully out of the
mouth go hanging with Khrushchev,

446
00:46:45,120 --> 00:46:50,120
promote giving him the ball and other
stuff in India and also in was helping

447
00:46:50,251 --> 00:46:51,020
India.

448
00:46:51,020 --> 00:46:51,853
India.

449
00:46:53,820 --> 00:46:54,560
Okay.

450
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:56,450
So you ever late fifties.

451
00:46:56,460 --> 00:46:57,230
Those are falling out.

452
00:46:57,230 --> 00:46:59,460
Calling the Chinese.

453
00:47:00,090 --> 00:47:03,610
Didn't most of the sentence just get go?

454
00:47:04,050 --> 00:47:04,900
We'll just

455
00:47:06,930 --> 00:47:07,763
so

456
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:10,920
early sixties.

457
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:12,330
But somebody had done some,

458
00:47:12,370 --> 00:47:13,540
actually saw

459
00:47:15,450 --> 00:47:16,840
terrible things happen.

460
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:18,250
Real,

461
00:47:18,250 --> 00:47:19,083
not

462
00:47:21,510 --> 00:47:23,020
one Chinese priest.

463
00:47:26,060 --> 00:47:27,510
There's a hole in the ground,

464
00:47:27,740 --> 00:47:28,573
uh,

465
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:32,040
compress the swollen that his
head was just ticking up by

466
00:47:33,900 --> 00:47:35,600
a metal backup.

467
00:47:35,770 --> 00:47:36,603
I raise him

468
00:47:39,220 --> 00:47:44,220
until he will just live on
the Z is not a every way

469
00:47:49,030 --> 00:47:49,820
very quickly.

470
00:47:49,820 --> 00:47:50,720
That's great.

471
00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:59,670
Number of different translations,

472
00:48:01,510 --> 00:48:02,230
Katie.

473
00:48:02,230 --> 00:48:03,063
Yes,

474
00:48:04,060 --> 00:48:06,170
for magazine piece together.

475
00:48:06,660 --> 00:48:11,590
Go out on a creed.

476
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:18,880
He invites me and it's not just the

477
00:48:21,900 --> 00:48:22,733
creative.

478
00:48:22,870 --> 00:48:27,040
Now it's exactly what I think happens to
those kids that should have to schools.

479
00:48:30,430 --> 00:48:31,810
That's my

480
00:48:34,170 --> 00:48:34,520
Google.

481
00:48:34,520 --> 00:48:35,353
My cool.

482
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:46,810
Um,

483
00:48:47,290 --> 00:48:48,760
why do I know about cruising and,

484
00:48:49,380 --> 00:48:52,050
but this is taking a little bit farther,

485
00:48:52,570 --> 00:48:55,540
very [inaudible] here for people can,

486
00:48:55,590 --> 00:48:56,790
people can hear.

487
00:48:57,010 --> 00:48:59,570
It's something that people
can turn into creative.

488
00:49:03,620 --> 00:49:08,620
The person who seriously seat's gone

489
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:15,400
through purification and
acceptance of the cross,

490
00:49:15,401 --> 00:49:16,234
which is,

491
00:49:16,310 --> 00:49:16,660
you know,

492
00:49:16,660 --> 00:49:19,890
the medicine that is given to
us for purification as well.

493
00:49:19,891 --> 00:49:24,891
So we put out then go gives his medicine
cause combination of two things.

494
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:28,550
It's a lot of stuff.

495
00:49:30,740 --> 00:49:35,740
But in the process the person begins to
see that nothing human is from to okay.

496
00:49:40,570 --> 00:49:41,403
That,

497
00:49:41,560 --> 00:49:42,660
uh,

498
00:49:44,380 --> 00:49:45,990
posting

499
00:49:50,610 --> 00:49:55,610
this distance between the saints and
sinners is a tiny step along the saints.

500
00:49:57,431 --> 00:49:59,980
Were always aware that

501
00:50:01,550 --> 00:50:02,450
a number of,

502
00:50:02,510 --> 00:50:05,300
of girl holding liquid,

503
00:50:05,320 --> 00:50:10,320
see all of these volcanic
processes themselves,

504
00:50:11,670 --> 00:50:12,503
district,

505
00:50:15,580 --> 00:50:16,490
it's not the best.

506
00:50:17,050 --> 00:50:17,883
Okay?

507
00:50:18,490 --> 00:50:19,850
Everything's beautiful now.

508
00:50:19,880 --> 00:50:20,830
Her modernism

509
00:50:22,890 --> 00:50:25,600
and the soul.

510
00:50:59,390 --> 00:51:00,223
Yes.

511
00:51:38,090 --> 00:51:38,923
When is

512
00:51:40,330 --> 00:51:42,830
he

513
00:51:45,740 --> 00:51:47,720
appreciate someone was just another nurse

514
00:51:49,670 --> 00:51:50,503
because

515
00:51:51,850 --> 00:51:54,320
you see,

516
00:52:02,890 --> 00:52:05,930
to accept the idea of God,

517
00:52:05,931 --> 00:52:06,764
can we communicate?

518
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:10,660
That's what this number is gone.

519
00:52:12,650 --> 00:52:17,650
Whereas Christianity presents
a paradoxical deals as
we can go all this mess.

520
00:52:24,740 --> 00:52:25,573
He's cool.

521
00:52:26,900 --> 00:52:29,510
He doesn't mean to make big noises.

522
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:37,880
There's a beautiful understanding
of that human to WHO's this guy here

523
00:52:44,940 --> 00:52:46,220
when he

524
00:52:52,750 --> 00:52:54,530
Bruce,

525
00:52:58,780 --> 00:53:00,310
if you will,

526
00:53:02,990 --> 00:53:03,823
in the morning,

527
00:53:03,890 --> 00:53:06,500
my name is don't just so she,

528
00:53:09,740 --> 00:53:12,610
because he went overboard
and he personally,

529
00:53:14,500 --> 00:53:15,333
it's all nothing.

530
00:53:18,680 --> 00:53:19,980
So he,

531
00:53:21,340 --> 00:53:22,173
he was,

532
00:53:23,180 --> 00:53:25,160
he ran it as a kid,

533
00:53:26,370 --> 00:53:27,203
uh,

534
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:29,033
uh,

535
00:53:30,630 --> 00:53:32,420
silence there and

536
00:53:34,020 --> 00:53:35,700
he was in deep depression

537
00:53:37,640 --> 00:53:40,270
and to bring him up,

538
00:53:40,910 --> 00:53:41,880
we'll get a

539
00:53:43,470 --> 00:53:44,560
visual.

540
00:53:45,470 --> 00:53:46,380
So things,

541
00:53:48,080 --> 00:53:48,970
how things

542
00:53:58,350 --> 00:53:59,890
ripping the

543
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:02,753
stall.

544
00:54:05,430 --> 00:54:06,263
Then

545
00:54:08,290 --> 00:54:09,123
when just

546
00:54:18,180 --> 00:54:19,770
jumped breach

547
00:54:22,890 --> 00:54:24,790
communication was

548
00:54:27,700 --> 00:54:29,290
those Jesse saying to the,

549
00:54:29,720 --> 00:54:30,560
to the fireman

550
00:54:34,020 --> 00:54:34,853
to

551
00:54:37,140 --> 00:54:37,973
come down

552
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:44,960
because learn from the bride
and meek and humble of hot

553
00:54:47,370 --> 00:54:52,370
because you have to find your medium life
by traveling on the heads of everybody

554
00:54:55,681 --> 00:54:57,280
else to associates.

555
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:01,550
You'll be always somebody who's easy.

556
00:55:04,840 --> 00:55:07,070
Even if you reached a pinnacle

557
00:55:10,870 --> 00:55:11,703
Hitler,

558
00:55:12,410 --> 00:55:16,710
right there is why many intensive.

559
00:55:21,480 --> 00:55:24,220
If you give up the ego,

560
00:55:24,221 --> 00:55:26,870
the pride and said

561
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:33,630
yes,

562
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:40,793
things happen.

563
00:55:41,600 --> 00:55:42,560
The Real,

564
00:55:45,460 --> 00:55:46,293
you know what I mean?

565
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:51,760
But that's difficult for
the full [inaudible],

566
00:55:54,620 --> 00:55:58,480
the Middle East and cycling

567
00:56:02,310 --> 00:56:03,143
one

568
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:05,313
these,

569
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:09,553
Jeez,

570
00:56:15,410 --> 00:56:17,520
it was somebody that looked like

571
00:56:20,320 --> 00:56:21,810
his profits to be,

572
00:56:41,780 --> 00:56:42,613
is there another

573
00:56:45,020 --> 00:56:46,600
Byzantine seems,

574
00:56:51,460 --> 00:56:52,293
I mean

575
00:56:54,780 --> 00:56:55,760
what we did

576
00:57:08,350 --> 00:57:09,183
the

577
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:13,633
recipe

578
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:37,940
because

579
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:45,713
did

580
00:57:49,320 --> 00:57:50,153
vote

581
00:57:53,610 --> 00:57:54,443
rule

582
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:03,800
rule because he was I Christ

583
00:58:09,380 --> 00:58:11,280
his person

584
00:58:13,530 --> 00:58:14,363
or

585
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:18,030
in your

586
00:58:27,810 --> 00:58:32,810
view and kind of a structure which you
have heard about vertical axis you have

587
00:58:35,900 --> 00:58:39,310
to go through,

588
00:58:48,420 --> 00:58:49,690
they had to rule

589
00:58:51,250 --> 00:58:52,310
in the field complex,

590
00:58:52,830 --> 00:58:55,470
but they will be okay.

591
00:58:57,640 --> 00:59:01,100
The fact that he is a

592
00:59:04,540 --> 00:59:08,730
political figure because
he is among the corporate.

593
00:59:10,030 --> 00:59:10,863
Fair enough.

594
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:12,273
Okay.

595
00:59:16,650 --> 00:59:17,590
And also the precursor,

596
00:59:20,930 --> 00:59:22,150
those two girls,

597
00:59:23,060 --> 00:59:23,950
this lady,

598
00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:25,370
this boy,

599
00:59:25,880 --> 00:59:26,713
we're slowly,

600
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:32,850
I think what's the point
of that very political

601
00:59:42,490 --> 00:59:43,323
structure

602
00:59:45,470 --> 00:59:47,330
you see that's very

603
00:59:53,780 --> 00:59:54,613
personal.

604
00:59:55,420 --> 00:59:56,253
The

605
00:59:58,730 --> 01:00:03,730
20th century was super strongly in an
agricultural country because of that.

606
01:00:05,750 --> 01:00:06,860
Most people,

607
01:00:07,020 --> 01:00:08,930
we connect it to the village

608
01:00:27,370 --> 01:00:32,160
Louis Parish

609
01:00:38,510 --> 01:00:39,343
received

610
01:00:45,470 --> 01:00:48,290
in the last couple of years
have been talking about

611
01:00:52,020 --> 01:00:53,470
the episodes

612
01:00:55,170 --> 01:00:56,003
as

613
01:00:57,880 --> 01:00:59,990
malls to do this

614
01:01:02,450 --> 01:01:07,450
think humanism room.

615
01:01:09,110 --> 01:01:10,110
There's no measurable.

616
01:01:15,690 --> 01:01:20,690
So it's important for the revolutionaries
to destroy traditional worldviews.

617
01:01:22,540 --> 01:01:27,540
And he was a key factor in the traditional
perception after that became Verizon

618
01:01:30,950 --> 01:01:31,783
too.

619
01:01:32,750 --> 01:01:34,940
Because see the simple,

620
01:01:35,220 --> 01:01:36,100
uh,

621
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:40,310
dozens of the basic source
of thought to themselves,

622
01:01:40,340 --> 01:01:41,173
okay,

623
01:01:41,210 --> 01:01:42,640
we've got [inaudible],

624
01:01:43,220 --> 01:01:46,280
we've got local people,

625
01:01:46,490 --> 01:01:48,390
some of them who are some not so good,

626
01:01:48,470 --> 01:01:52,020
but ultimately there is truth personally.

627
01:01:54,780 --> 01:01:59,570
So if suddenly he's destroyed

628
01:02:01,160 --> 01:02:01,993
your rights

629
01:02:05,100 --> 01:02:07,340
as a collapse of a whole view.

630
01:02:11,260 --> 01:02:12,093
If people

631
01:02:14,150 --> 01:02:19,150
have the education and experience in with,

632
01:02:19,650 --> 01:02:20,483
uh,

633
01:02:20,550 --> 01:02:21,383
all sorts of

634
01:02:24,390 --> 01:02:25,530
different ideas.

635
01:02:25,531 --> 01:02:26,364
But when you,

636
01:02:26,470 --> 01:02:29,910
you come from a very holistic

637
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:35,730
kind of singular view of the universe,

638
01:02:37,090 --> 01:02:38,880
something very big as,

639
01:02:39,630 --> 01:02:39,920
okay,

640
01:02:39,920 --> 01:02:44,920
well maybe like if he
allowed that sort of stuff.

641
01:03:05,640 --> 01:03:07,510
So how long until the
rest of his painting,

642
01:03:10,490 --> 01:03:12,090
the two,

643
01:03:12,091 --> 01:03:12,924
three years

644
01:04:01,530 --> 01:04:03,570
using two weeks to fly,

645
01:04:03,950 --> 01:04:08,400
do we use to cover their faces?

646
01:04:09,950 --> 01:04:11,640
The Majesty of God

647
01:04:14,860 --> 01:04:15,693
cannot

648
01:04:44,990 --> 01:04:46,510
represents class

649
01:04:54,890 --> 01:04:56,200
for adventures

650
01:04:59,460 --> 01:05:00,660
outside.

651
01:05:05,340 --> 01:05:06,770
You've got the hospital

652
01:05:10,380 --> 01:05:11,550
for different views

653
01:05:14,240 --> 01:05:15,250
there.

654
01:05:34,920 --> 01:05:35,753
Yes.

655
01:05:58,380 --> 01:05:59,520
No,

656
01:05:59,700 --> 01:06:00,550
this is why.

657
01:06:02,770 --> 01:06:03,603
No.

658
01:06:05,320 --> 01:06:06,153
Okay.

659
01:06:07,410 --> 01:06:08,450
Waters,

660
01:06:08,960 --> 01:06:09,793
right.

661
01:06:11,670 --> 01:06:14,050
The flood for capitalism

662
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:18,273
simple.

663
01:06:18,660 --> 01:06:19,493
The

664
01:06:25,750 --> 01:06:26,583
brief,

665
01:06:30,880 --> 01:06:31,713
first of all,

666
01:06:31,750 --> 01:06:32,583
he to do a little bit

667
01:06:41,640 --> 01:06:42,770
more just

668
01:07:05,430 --> 01:07:06,263
because

669
01:07:10,100 --> 01:07:15,100
his death and resurrection of Christ

670
01:07:19,900 --> 01:07:20,733
die

671
01:07:26,910 --> 01:07:27,743
most

672
01:07:29,050 --> 01:07:29,883
sick

673
01:07:31,470 --> 01:07:35,000
and symbol of peace.

674
01:07:37,890 --> 01:07:40,040
It's interesting that it must be so

675
01:07:42,230 --> 01:07:46,470
Asian used use three.

676
01:07:51,030 --> 01:07:51,863
They use

677
01:07:54,950 --> 01:07:59,950
symbols here because this is
the beginning of the pricing.

678
01:08:03,840 --> 01:08:08,330
The peace.

679
01:08:15,920 --> 01:08:17,730
He is piece,

680
01:08:18,200 --> 01:08:19,033
uh,

681
01:08:19,530 --> 01:08:22,420
is Christ the team from an

682
01:08:26,930 --> 01:08:28,390
ancient Christian,

683
01:08:34,320 --> 01:08:38,690
the Holy Spirit.

684
01:09:01,060 --> 01:09:02,420
Why do you think,

685
01:09:02,960 --> 01:09:05,870
how do you explain the fact that some
of the people don't step away from the

686
01:09:05,890 --> 01:09:06,723
church

687
01:09:43,070 --> 01:09:46,260
because the people who were getting all

688
01:09:51,560 --> 01:09:52,520
three,

689
01:09:56,180 --> 01:09:57,013
why?

690
01:09:57,680 --> 01:10:00,570
Why is that

691
01:10:03,780 --> 01:10:04,613
you think?

692
01:10:06,250 --> 01:10:07,190
I mean everything you told me,

693
01:10:10,670 --> 01:10:11,503
he said,

694
01:10:12,280 --> 01:10:13,113
look,

695
01:10:16,700 --> 01:10:17,560
I'll give you

696
01:10:22,910 --> 01:10:23,743
just,

697
01:10:24,130 --> 01:10:26,050
it's sort of

698
01:10:28,540 --> 01:10:32,360
in the first 300 years,

699
01:10:38,010 --> 01:10:38,843
people

700
01:10:45,970 --> 01:10:46,803
love

701
01:10:51,330 --> 01:10:52,430
these people can,

702
01:10:53,200 --> 01:10:54,490
we would pull up

703
01:11:00,980 --> 01:11:02,030
something has to change

704
01:11:07,620 --> 01:11:09,380
to tell you everything.

705
01:11:26,100 --> 01:11:26,933
Unfortunately,

706
01:11:27,290 --> 01:11:28,123
it's

707
01:11:31,770 --> 01:11:36,770
difficult to live the life when
things are okay because that forces,

708
01:11:44,600 --> 01:11:45,830
it forces us down.

709
01:11:47,050 --> 01:11:48,530
When you have really,

710
01:11:49,030 --> 01:11:51,360
really sensitive to mobilize

711
01:11:55,610 --> 01:11:56,490
to fall,

712
01:11:59,760 --> 01:12:00,593
there's a rush.

713
01:12:02,250 --> 01:12:04,750
The transverse like this

714
01:12:06,550 --> 01:12:08,810
collapse the peasant,

715
01:12:12,160 --> 01:12:13,390
we get the juice

716
01:12:15,100 --> 01:12:16,370
that um,

717
01:12:17,070 --> 01:12:22,070
it's difficult circumstances that people
really know where they're in anguish.

718
01:12:26,680 --> 01:12:31,680
The matter of fact today
people come because they

719
01:12:37,550 --> 01:12:41,050
know people can be an English

720
01:12:51,820 --> 01:12:54,590
movies and stuff like that.

721
01:12:55,890 --> 01:12:56,800
Take my attention.

722
01:12:57,140 --> 01:12:58,670
It's like,

723
01:13:05,440 --> 01:13:05,780
well,

724
01:13:05,780 --> 01:13:09,450
one of the things that
struck me because you know,

725
01:13:09,480 --> 01:13:11,630
after people

726
01:13:15,670 --> 01:13:19,570
waste their life worth

727
01:13:31,810 --> 01:13:33,030
something like

728
01:13:36,140 --> 01:13:38,240
this,

729
01:13:41,580 --> 01:13:45,390
most of the spots always,

730
01:13:45,420 --> 01:13:46,480
always the same thing.

731
01:13:46,510 --> 01:13:47,460
We never talked,

732
01:13:48,500 --> 01:13:49,333
especially

733
01:13:50,770 --> 01:13:52,610
something about a seeking sad,

734
01:13:52,920 --> 01:13:53,753
I think it is.

735
01:13:56,450 --> 01:13:59,260
They don't think each

736
01:14:00,950 --> 01:14:01,783
cares,

737
01:14:02,200 --> 01:14:03,033
they have

738
01:14:08,420 --> 01:14:10,640
be infectious.

739
01:14:21,240 --> 01:14:26,240
We need people to communicate
the basics because

740
01:14:28,390 --> 01:14:30,160
you cannot understand
what I'm talking about.

741
01:14:31,400 --> 01:14:32,233
The one on

742
01:14:33,690 --> 01:14:34,730
maybe

743
01:14:45,370 --> 01:14:46,420
because

744
01:14:48,370 --> 01:14:51,940
they got to get back to that babysits

745
01:14:53,500 --> 01:14:54,333
my children.

746
01:14:55,980 --> 01:14:56,813
Okay.

747
01:14:57,530 --> 01:14:58,363
Because

748
01:15:21,840 --> 01:15:26,700
he's a good representative of very smart,

749
01:15:28,220 --> 01:15:30,110
a CP

750
01:15:39,410 --> 01:15:40,490
can play.

751
01:15:41,730 --> 01:15:43,180
We can sit back and see

752
01:16:10,280 --> 01:16:11,113
works

753
01:16:24,520 --> 01:16:25,920
for 64

754
01:16:29,840 --> 01:16:33,560
we were talking about
rural job assistance.

755
01:16:34,390 --> 01:16:35,020
No,

756
01:16:35,020 --> 01:16:35,853
no.

757
01:16:36,410 --> 01:16:38,740
Computational systems
cannot do complex things.

758
01:16:38,741 --> 01:16:41,110
Fire this roof.

759
01:16:41,710 --> 01:16:42,880
It's not possible.

760
01:16:42,910 --> 01:16:43,820
So yay.

761
01:16:43,821 --> 01:16:45,820
I system network systems.

762
01:16:48,540 --> 01:16:49,373
We don't know what

763
01:16:53,800 --> 01:16:55,000
we're talking about.

764
01:16:56,950 --> 01:16:57,460
The funding,

765
01:16:57,460 --> 01:17:01,590
different quality architecture
can be facing store growth,

766
01:17:02,070 --> 01:17:02,903
which is also something

767
01:17:10,100 --> 01:17:10,933
is

768
01:17:12,470 --> 01:17:13,303
specific.

769
01:17:17,410 --> 01:17:18,420
So

770
01:17:21,430 --> 01:17:21,990
what?

771
01:17:21,990 --> 01:17:25,590
Harrison Harrison,

772
01:18:01,780 --> 01:18:02,613
because

773
01:18:10,960 --> 01:18:13,070
African students on Europe,

774
01:18:14,850 --> 01:18:18,160
I said it was forced European migrants.

775
01:18:18,320 --> 01:18:19,260
It's a calming force.

776
01:18:20,240 --> 01:18:24,800
Interpret everything under a particular
rubric and disciplines as a consequence.

777
01:18:28,300 --> 01:18:32,450
Water.
