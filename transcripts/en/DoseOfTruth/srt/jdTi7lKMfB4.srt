1
00:00:07,070 --> 00:00:10,040
But the big three factors
that I think are explaining,

2
00:00:10,041 --> 00:00:12,620
explaining what's happening
on campus are one,

3
00:00:12,621 --> 00:00:16,370
the loss of the unsupervised place
so that the kids have always,

4
00:00:16,371 --> 00:00:17,390
there's always an adult present.

5
00:00:17,391 --> 00:00:20,030
And so they come to college and they
expect there to be an adult or dean,

6
00:00:20,031 --> 00:00:21,290
somebody if there's a conflict.

7
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:22,363
That's one.

8
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:26,330
Two is social media which hit just as ign.

9
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:27,140
So ign,

10
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:27,980
Internet generation.

11
00:00:27,981 --> 00:00:29,180
This is Jeanne Twinkies work.

12
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:29,871
You know,

13
00:00:29,871 --> 00:00:30,320
we used to,

14
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:31,700
we used to think that,

15
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:32,563
um,

16
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:33,290
uh,

17
00:00:33,290 --> 00:00:38,290
we used to think that the
millennial generation ends
in 1998 or 2000 let Jean 20

18
00:00:39,591 --> 00:00:43,100
shows looking at for large
datasets that birth year,

19
00:00:43,101 --> 00:00:47,750
1995 kids born in 1995 and
after are really different.

20
00:00:47,751 --> 00:00:48,890
They're values are different.

21
00:00:49,310 --> 00:00:52,940
They have much higher rates
of anxiety and depression,

22
00:00:52,941 --> 00:00:53,780
especially the girls.

23
00:00:53,781 --> 00:00:54,411
Boys have gone up,

24
00:00:54,411 --> 00:00:54,591
grows,

25
00:00:54,591 --> 00:00:55,550
are going way up.

26
00:00:56,270 --> 00:00:57,103
Um,

27
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:00,590
and the reason it seems to be
that Facebook lowered its age.

28
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:01,453
Um,

29
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,140
so in 2005,

30
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:07,580
you had to be a college
student at a certain number
of colleges to get Facebook.

31
00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:12,850
In 2006 you could be any 11 year old who
lies and says that she's 13 and you've

32
00:01:13,401 --> 00:01:14,270
got a Facebook account.

33
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:15,720
Um,

34
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:16,250
uh,

35
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:18,140
but then you're using on your parent's PC,

36
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:23,050
it's in 2007 the iPhone comes out
and it saturates the market fashion.

37
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:24,650
Any consumer product ever has.

38
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:29,800
So by 2010 or 11 a lot of adolescents
have have Facebook and other social

39
00:01:31,101 --> 00:01:33,800
platforms and this is just devastating,

40
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:36,560
especially to girls
because it's not texting,

41
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:38,100
texting is just me to you.

42
00:01:38,101 --> 00:01:38,510
You know,

43
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:39,141
that's back and forth.

44
00:01:39,141 --> 00:01:40,220
That's fine that you know,

45
00:01:40,221 --> 00:01:40,431
we,

46
00:01:40,431 --> 00:01:40,971
when we were kids,

47
00:01:40,971 --> 00:01:41,960
you called your friends on the phone,

48
00:01:41,961 --> 00:01:42,794
that's fine.

49
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:47,100
The problem seems to be according to 20
it's especially platforms in which he

50
00:01:47,101 --> 00:01:51,530
puts something out and then you wait
and see what everyone says and that

51
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:55,130
especially as damaging to
girls who already are at
risk of eating disorders and

52
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:55,983
image disorders.

53
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:56,710
Okay,

54
00:01:56,710 --> 00:02:00,290
so girls become more susceptible to
negative emotion when they hit puberty?

55
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:00,711
Well there,

56
00:02:00,711 --> 00:02:01,370
there,

57
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:01,790
yes.

58
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:02,001
Yes.

59
00:02:02,001 --> 00:02:02,120
Right.

60
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:02,901
That's always been the case.

61
00:02:02,901 --> 00:02:05,600
Then there's another issue too
with regards to female aggression.

62
00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:06,883
So,

63
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:07,973
you know,

64
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:13,220
it's clearly the case that males are more
likely to be physically damaging slash

65
00:02:13,221 --> 00:02:14,470
aggressive than females are.

66
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:17,710
But what females use his
reputation savaging that's right.

67
00:02:17,711 --> 00:02:18,740
So that's Nikki cricks work.

68
00:02:18,741 --> 00:02:20,900
Nikki Crick passed away
a couple of years ago,

69
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,790
showed that if you add it all up,

70
00:02:22,791 --> 00:02:24,110
boys and girls equally aggressive,

71
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:26,120
but the boys aggression is more physical.

72
00:02:26,121 --> 00:02:26,451
The girls,

73
00:02:26,451 --> 00:02:27,284
the more relational.

74
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,660
So if you imagine a bunch of 13,

75
00:02:29,661 --> 00:02:34,160
14 year olds in their middle schools and
then you parachute in a whole bunch of

76
00:02:34,161 --> 00:02:34,994
iPhones,

77
00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:36,260
everybody's got one of their pots,

78
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:37,940
what are the boys going to do?

79
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:40,100
They're gonna play video games
and that doesn't hurt anybody,

80
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:44,810
but the girls are going to use it
to amplify the social interactions.

81
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,490
So this is 20 twenty's explanation.

82
00:02:46,491 --> 00:02:47,480
I think it makes a lot of sense.

83
00:02:47,481 --> 00:02:47,990
So it's a,

84
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:48,781
it's a catastrophe.

85
00:02:48,781 --> 00:02:50,720
It's a crisis and we're really hurting,

86
00:02:50,721 --> 00:02:51,740
especially the girls.

87
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:52,550
Um,

88
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:54,470
so we've got to change
something about that anyway.

89
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:55,630
But social media is,

90
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:59,180
is possibly the largest single
reason why things are going haywire.

91
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:00,183
Campus.

92
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:01,610
The third big factor,

93
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:04,210
do you think it's primarily
Facebook or can you tell?

94
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:04,421
Well,

95
00:03:04,421 --> 00:03:04,751
it's,

96
00:03:04,751 --> 00:03:05,440
it's uh,

97
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:05,740
uh,

98
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:07,600
the kids use a lot of different platforms,

99
00:03:07,601 --> 00:03:08,920
but from what I hear,

100
00:03:08,921 --> 00:03:09,760
Instagram,

101
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,201
Facebook,

102
00:03:11,201 --> 00:03:12,130
snapchat,

103
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:12,851
it again,

104
00:03:12,851 --> 00:03:14,110
the thing is it's one to many.

105
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:15,130
That's what's bad.

106
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:16,610
It's anything if it,

107
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:17,081
if it's,

108
00:03:17,081 --> 00:03:20,200
if it's you put something out there
and you see how many people like it,

109
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:21,140
that's what's been right.

110
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:23,830
And there's always the threat that
it'll go viral and the terrible way.

111
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:24,561
So that's right.

112
00:03:24,561 --> 00:03:25,030
Hammer.

113
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:25,863
Exactly.

114
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:29,590
There's this sort of damage
that's limited damage.

115
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:31,330
Unlimited downside to saying something.

116
00:03:31,331 --> 00:03:32,130
So what do you do?

117
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:32,860
Careful.

118
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:36,070
So I don't know if I want to
like that post because you know,

119
00:03:36,071 --> 00:03:37,110
I could get in big trouble for it.

120
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:37,480
Right.

121
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:37,631
Well,

122
00:03:37,631 --> 00:03:40,930
the benefit to liking it as minimal
and the potential catastrophe for does

123
00:03:40,931 --> 00:03:42,190
unless you're expected to like it,

124
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:44,710
in which case you better like
it because if you don't like it,

125
00:03:44,711 --> 00:03:45,544
you'll get in trouble.

126
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:48,010
So it's a much more of a mob mentality.

127
00:03:48,011 --> 00:03:48,641
Kids are afraid,

128
00:03:48,641 --> 00:03:48,970
you know,

129
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:49,840
I'm not blaming the kids,

130
00:03:49,841 --> 00:03:50,680
I'm very sympathetic to them.

131
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:51,611
And these are my kids.

132
00:03:51,611 --> 00:03:53,740
Are My kids are 11 and seven,

133
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:54,940
they're going to come up into this.

134
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:55,840
Um,

135
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,430
so the kids have been raised in a,

136
00:03:57,490 --> 00:03:58,440
in a social environment,

137
00:03:58,441 --> 00:03:59,770
it's much more about mob,

138
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:03,940
mob formation and mob attacks and
Bob defend defenses against mobs.

139
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,233
Um,

140
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:05,880
and then,

141
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:09,640
so the third factor then is the political
polarization and that purification or

142
00:04:09,641 --> 00:04:10,474
institutions.

143
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:15,070
So if you imagine coming up in the 90s
when political polarization is going up,

144
00:04:15,071 --> 00:04:17,380
we're beginning to hate each
other more across party lines,

145
00:04:17,381 --> 00:04:18,820
but it's not that hard.

146
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:19,440
Not that,

147
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,273
that nasty,

148
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,310
but it's been getting much,

149
00:04:21,311 --> 00:04:22,210
much more hostile.

150
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:24,010
So that now if someone,

151
00:04:24,011 --> 00:04:25,030
like if someone's is,

152
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:26,470
if someone goes to a campus,

153
00:04:26,471 --> 00:04:27,550
Republicans meeting,

154
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:30,160
if it's a Democrat who goes
to a meeting of the campus,

155
00:04:30,161 --> 00:04:33,100
Republicans has happened at UC
Santa Cruz a couple weeks ago,

156
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,233
um,

157
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:34,750
uh,

158
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:35,710
and someone finds out,

159
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:36,320
you know,

160
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,320
so the,

161
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:37,700
the,

162
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:37,940
the,

163
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:38,741
the hatred,

164
00:04:38,741 --> 00:04:41,890
the Cross party hatred
is so much stronger now.

165
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:45,100
And many of our
institutions are much pure.

166
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,600
So if you went to college in the 90s,

167
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:48,880
there might've been a few
conservative professors around,

168
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,350
but now there aren't.

169
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:50,951
So,

170
00:04:50,951 --> 00:04:51,611
as you said before,

171
00:04:51,611 --> 00:04:52,510
it's like exposure therapy.

172
00:04:52,511 --> 00:04:54,790
If you've never encountered
a conservative idea,

173
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:58,480
and then a conservative like Heather
MacDonald comes to speak on your campus.

174
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:58,751
Well,

175
00:04:58,751 --> 00:05:00,790
this is like a major
immune response problem.

176
00:05:00,791 --> 00:05:03,790
We've got to get the tribe
together and mob her and you know,

177
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:04,713
shut her down.

178
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:05,920
Um,

179
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,210
so those are the,

180
00:05:07,211 --> 00:05:07,361
I mean,

181
00:05:07,361 --> 00:05:08,380
there are many other reasons,

182
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:10,720
but the loss of unsupervised play,

183
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:13,090
social media and rice and polarization,

184
00:05:13,091 --> 00:05:14,080
those are the three big ones.
