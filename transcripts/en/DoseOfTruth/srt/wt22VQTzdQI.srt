1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:01,013
Um,

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:04,140
for those who are very creative
but high in neuroticism,

3
00:00:04,141 --> 00:00:07,920
how should one work to gain emotional
stability in order to go out into chaos to

4
00:00:07,921 --> 00:00:08,760
do more creative things?

5
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:10,290
That's a really good question.

6
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:14,610
You know what I learned about that
by reading Young's works on Alchemy,

7
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:15,421
weirdly enough.

8
00:00:15,421 --> 00:00:19,260
And so back again in graduate school
when I was writing starting to write maps

9
00:00:19,261 --> 00:00:21,960
of meaning and really tearing
myself apart psychologically,

10
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:26,990
I'm trying to understand evil I suppose
the evil of the Cold War and the evil of

11
00:00:27,121 --> 00:00:30,450
the individuals who compose Nazi
Germany and Stelling this Brusha.

12
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:31,953
Um,

13
00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:33,060
uh,

14
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:34,980
I was reading Carl Jung because he,

15
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:35,460
he,

16
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:39,600
he wrote his tracks on alchemy where
a lot about self transformation and he

17
00:00:39,601 --> 00:00:40,434
talked about,

18
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:41,520
uh,

19
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,370
it's hard to explain his works on Alchemy,

20
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:47,400
but suffice it to say that
his advice was something like,

21
00:00:47,401 --> 00:00:50,910
the advice he derived from the alchemist
was that if you are going to make mess

22
00:00:50,911 --> 00:00:54,030
around with very complicated
and dangerous matters,

23
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:55,380
that's a good way of putting it.

24
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:57,810
That you should really
put your life together.

25
00:00:57,811 --> 00:01:01,620
And so I would say the right way to deal
with your neuroticism is to increase

26
00:01:01,621 --> 00:01:02,700
your conscientiousness.

27
00:01:02,701 --> 00:01:05,820
Because we also know that the
higher your conscientiousness,

28
00:01:05,821 --> 00:01:09,360
the lower your neuroticism
conscientiousness does seem
to keep neuroticism and

29
00:01:09,361 --> 00:01:09,721
check.

30
00:01:09,721 --> 00:01:10,590
And so I would say,

31
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:12,300
and have said this to many people,

32
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:13,583
um,

33
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:14,603
clean your room,

34
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,290
organize your life,

35
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:18,720
like get a routine,

36
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:20,190
get up everyday at the same time,

37
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,600
go to bed at the same time.

38
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:23,670
Establish discipline habits.

39
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:25,800
And that will help a lot.

40
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:26,790
Schedule like,

41
00:01:26,791 --> 00:01:28,230
and here's how to use a schedule.

42
00:01:28,231 --> 00:01:28,770
Use it.

43
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:29,400
Use a calendar.
