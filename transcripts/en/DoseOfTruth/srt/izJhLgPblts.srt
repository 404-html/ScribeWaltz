1
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:10,150
So one of the things that's really
interesting about psychoanalysis,

2
00:00:10,151 --> 00:00:14,530
so one of the things I love about it is
that psychoanalyst tell you if someone

3
00:00:14,531 --> 00:00:16,660
says I'm good,

4
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:18,010
okay,

5
00:00:18,010 --> 00:00:19,660
or I stand for a good thing,

6
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:22,480
the first thing you want to look
for is the opposite of that.

7
00:00:22,481 --> 00:00:22,781
It's like,

8
00:00:22,781 --> 00:00:23,051
okay,

9
00:00:23,051 --> 00:00:24,520
that's what you say.

10
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:27,130
What might really be going on?

11
00:00:27,131 --> 00:00:30,760
Or is it actually the case that you're
Jesus Christ and all the saints combined?

12
00:00:30,761 --> 00:00:31,031
You know,

13
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:35,800
you're this perfect person or there are
there dark motives for what you're doing

14
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:38,260
that you claim to be doing for the good.

15
00:00:38,650 --> 00:00:40,480
So guy named George Orwell,

16
00:00:40,481 --> 00:00:43,820
who was one of the world's
most creative essayists in,

17
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:44,290
in,

18
00:00:44,290 --> 00:00:46,150
in this in the 20th century,

19
00:00:46,151 --> 00:00:46,541
he was a,

20
00:00:46,541 --> 00:00:47,560
he was a left winger.

21
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:49,840
He wrote some things
that were very criticism,

22
00:00:49,870 --> 00:00:51,750
critical of socialist
movements and what did,

23
00:00:51,751 --> 00:00:56,751
it was one of the early critics of of
Soviet Russia when it was sort of in vogue

24
00:00:58,451 --> 00:01:00,970
among intellectuals to be
supportive of the Soviets.

25
00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:04,660
One of the things he said about left wing
socialist was that they didn't really

26
00:01:04,661 --> 00:01:05,440
like the poor.

27
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:06,730
He was talking about middle class,

28
00:01:06,731 --> 00:01:07,750
left wing socialist,

29
00:01:07,751 --> 00:01:10,630
not the working class guys who
were in unions and you know,

30
00:01:10,631 --> 00:01:14,980
had some justification for their struggle
against those who are at the top of

31
00:01:14,981 --> 00:01:18,160
the power hierarchy was more looking at
people that were already at the top of

32
00:01:18,161 --> 00:01:19,090
the power hierarchy,

33
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:22,000
who are claiming to be
advocates for the working class.

34
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:22,560
You know,

35
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,930
and his claim fundamentally was that
those people didn't like the poor.

36
00:01:25,931 --> 00:01:27,250
They just hated the rich.

37
00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:27,941
And you know,

38
00:01:27,941 --> 00:01:29,110
that's the,

39
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:33,310
it was difficult for the publisher
who was publishing that book,

40
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:34,360
which was called

41
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:35,653
MMM.

42
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:38,480
Road to Wigan pier,

43
00:01:38,481 --> 00:01:39,590
which is an amazing book.

44
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:41,570
It's a book about coal miners in northern,

45
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:43,220
in northern Britain and it's,

46
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:43,881
it's brutal.

47
00:01:43,881 --> 00:01:45,170
Those people at brutal lives,

48
00:01:45,171 --> 00:01:45,770
man.

49
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:46,603
So,

50
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:47,533
but anyways,

51
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:48,350
uh,

52
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:49,040
you know,

53
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:49,850
the publisher,

54
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:51,050
which was the left book club,

55
00:01:51,051 --> 00:01:52,040
if I remember correctly,

56
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:56,570
was very low to publish the essay that
went along with that book because it was

57
00:01:56,571 --> 00:02:00,650
such a devastating criticism of sort
of middleclass socialism anyways.

58
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:01,310
Anyways,

59
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:03,230
so the psychoanalysts
are always telling you,

60
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:04,131
look,

61
00:02:04,131 --> 00:02:04,700
you know,

62
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:05,570
there you are,

63
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:06,800
there's no monster.

64
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:07,491
It's like,

65
00:02:07,491 --> 00:02:07,761
okay,

66
00:02:07,761 --> 00:02:08,571
where's the monster?

67
00:02:08,571 --> 00:02:09,680
Because it's somewhere,

68
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:12,670
it's somewhere because
there's a monster in everyone.

69
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:15,800
And if you're hiding it or covering
it up or pretending that you know,

70
00:02:15,801 --> 00:02:17,120
you only stand for the good.

71
00:02:17,121 --> 00:02:20,630
It's like all that means is that you're
ignorant and naive about your own

72
00:02:20,631 --> 00:02:21,261
possibility.

73
00:02:21,261 --> 00:02:22,910
There's a monster around there somewhere.

74
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,073
So,

75
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:25,731
yeah.

76
00:02:25,731 --> 00:02:26,600
And that's partly because,

77
00:02:26,601 --> 00:02:26,871
you know,

78
00:02:26,871 --> 00:02:27,740
if you're not a monster,

79
00:02:27,741 --> 00:02:30,500
it's pretty hard to stay
alive because you know,

80
00:02:30,501 --> 00:02:32,390
you have to contend with things like this,

81
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:35,440
sorry,

82
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:40,060
things like this and things like this and
things like this and things like this,

83
00:02:40,061 --> 00:02:40,361
you know,

84
00:02:40,361 --> 00:02:41,194
that's your life.

85
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,300
You contend with that nature is brutal.

86
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:44,500
Culture is brutal,

87
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:46,480
and other people can be brutal too.

88
00:02:46,481 --> 00:02:49,990
And so if you're not prepared for
that and able to withstand it,

89
00:02:49,991 --> 00:02:51,490
then you're just going to get rolled over.

90
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:55,120
So you better get the old inner
monster developed because,

91
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:58,780
and under conscious control because
even though it's a terrible thing,

92
00:02:58,781 --> 00:02:59,380
you need it.
