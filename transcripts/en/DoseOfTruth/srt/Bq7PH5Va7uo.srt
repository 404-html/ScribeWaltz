1
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:08,430
So the hypothalamus is is an entity,

2
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:13,400
it's a group of functionally related
entities that are composed of groups of

3
00:00:13,401 --> 00:00:14,790
functionally related entities,

4
00:00:14,791 --> 00:00:19,050
but you know you can't start at the
highest level of detail and progress

5
00:00:19,051 --> 00:00:19,561
forward.

6
00:00:19,561 --> 00:00:20,790
So we're going to use shortcuts.

7
00:00:20,791 --> 00:00:21,301
So anyways,

8
00:00:21,301 --> 00:00:26,301
the hypothalamus isn't a very big brain
area but it's an important one and it's

9
00:00:26,341 --> 00:00:30,780
sufficiently sophisticated so that if
you take a female cat and that there's an

10
00:00:30,781 --> 00:00:34,740
important reason that it's female and
you take out basically it's whole brain,

11
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:39,510
the limbic system that's responsible
for emotions and the whole cortical cap.

12
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:42,600
So it basically has no brain
except for his final chord.

13
00:00:42,601 --> 00:00:43,291
The hypothalamus.

14
00:00:43,291 --> 00:00:47,190
And if you keep it in a relatively
closed environment you don't like like a

15
00:00:47,191 --> 00:00:48,024
cage,

16
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:50,250
it pretty much acts like a normal cat.

17
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:53,010
It can do all the normal cat things.

18
00:00:53,011 --> 00:00:53,700
It can,

19
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:55,800
it can engage in defensive aggression,

20
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:57,233
it can eat,

21
00:00:57,750 --> 00:00:58,583
it can drink,

22
00:00:58,590 --> 00:00:59,490
it can sleep.

23
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:00,240
It's Co,

24
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:03,750
it's conscious as you know in so far as
you can tell whether or not an animal is

25
00:01:03,751 --> 00:01:04,584
conscious,

26
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,360
it's hyper exploratory,

27
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:11,260
which is extraordinarily peculiar because
last thing you would expect of a cap

28
00:01:11,261 --> 00:01:13,590
with no brain would be
to be hyper exploratory.

29
00:01:13,591 --> 00:01:13,801
Right?

30
00:01:13,801 --> 00:01:18,750
It seems to be insanely curious about
everything and that's what that seems to

31
00:01:18,751 --> 00:01:22,950
indicate is that it's
psychomotor exploratory system,

32
00:01:22,951 --> 00:01:26,010
which is in fact grounded in the
hypothalamus is still active,

33
00:01:26,011 --> 00:01:29,520
but it can't build up the memory
representations that would inhibit the

34
00:01:29,521 --> 00:01:34,521
exploratory activity because basically
what you're doing when you explore is

35
00:01:34,831 --> 00:01:35,910
you're taking something,

36
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:37,980
something complex and then your mapping.

37
00:01:37,981 --> 00:01:42,981
It's responses in relationship to the
transformations of your body and in so far

38
00:01:43,651 --> 00:01:47,790
as the set of transformations of your
body that you're likely to manifest,

39
00:01:47,791 --> 00:01:49,470
say in this place,

40
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:53,190
have zero motivational relevance,

41
00:01:53,191 --> 00:01:55,830
which is really what you're
hoping for most of the time.

42
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:59,250
Then you build up a representation
of the place that's,

43
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:04,140
that's part of that perceptual motor
hierarchy and it shuts off your curiosity

44
00:02:04,141 --> 00:02:07,740
about it and then what you perceive
from then on end really is your

45
00:02:07,741 --> 00:02:09,120
representation of the thing.

46
00:02:09,121 --> 00:02:10,500
Rather than the thing itself.

47
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:14,250
And you're kind of happy about that
because it's easier to see what you've

48
00:02:14,251 --> 00:02:17,370
already learned that it is
to see that thing itself.

49
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:21,260
Now things can get re novelized you know,

50
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:24,470
if someone acts very
peculiarly right beside you,

51
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:28,500
you're like the whole space around you
is going to get re novelized very rapidly

52
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:30,690
and your body would go
on alert because of that.

53
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:31,560
But Mick,

54
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:35,100
basically what you're doing is
learning in order to ignore,

55
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:36,570
right?

56
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:37,270
Because you want,

57
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:39,030
you want to pay attention
to everything all the time.

58
00:02:39,031 --> 00:02:40,080
It's like that's,

59
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:44,490
that's a short path to exhaustion because
if everything's relevant than your

60
00:02:44,491 --> 00:02:47,850
body goes on hyper alert and you
produce cortisol and you know,

61
00:02:47,851 --> 00:02:49,490
you're ready for anything and there's,

62
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:50,820
that's kind of exciting.

63
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:53,220
But as a longterm survival strategy,

64
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:53,671
it's bad.

65
00:02:53,671 --> 00:02:57,240
What you just don't have the energy to
maintain that for any length of time.

66
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:01,540
So part of the reason the cat is hyper
exploratory is because the systems that

67
00:03:01,541 --> 00:03:06,160
mediate exploration are still intact as
long as it has a hypothalamus and some

68
00:03:06,161 --> 00:03:10,180
of the rough underlying circuitry that
associates that with the motor output

69
00:03:10,181 --> 00:03:11,014
system.

70
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:12,190
Um,

71
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:14,140
but I can't remember what it's explored.

72
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:17,110
So just stays hyper exploratory.

73
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:20,080
It's also hyper reactive
safety cues of aggression.

74
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:23,290
I would say like a hypothalamic
cat is a lot like a two year old,

75
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:24,460
you know,

76
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:26,350
and I mean that in the best possible way.

77
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:27,010
Um,

78
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:28,600
two year olds are extremely curious.

79
00:03:28,601 --> 00:03:29,680
They're hyper exploratory.

80
00:03:29,681 --> 00:03:30,191
They're very,

81
00:03:30,191 --> 00:03:32,230
very reactive to stimuli.

82
00:03:32,231 --> 00:03:32,620
You know,

83
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:33,520
they cry easily,

84
00:03:33,521 --> 00:03:34,570
they laugh easily,

85
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:35,740
they run around easily.

86
00:03:35,741 --> 00:03:36,100
They,

87
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:37,840
they get scared easily.

88
00:03:37,841 --> 00:03:38,440
They,

89
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:38,770
you know,

90
00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:40,060
experienced pain easily.

91
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:41,163
So,

92
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:44,790
and it isn't until they build the
higher order structures in the,

93
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:45,633
in the,

94
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:46,270
you know,

95
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:50,500
perceptual motor hierarchy that that
all gets integrated and they're not so

96
00:03:50,501 --> 00:03:53,190
reactive then they're nowhere near
as much fun at that point either,

97
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:53,890
you know,

98
00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:54,723
but uh,

99
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:55,451
you know,

100
00:03:55,451 --> 00:03:57,140
and so the female cat can,

101
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,150
can regulate its,

102
00:03:58,151 --> 00:04:01,540
its water intake and it can
also engage in sexual activity.

103
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:03,880
Now a male cat can't do that.

104
00:04:03,881 --> 00:04:07,540
It needs more brain than
just the hypothalamus because
it's more complicated to

105
00:04:07,541 --> 00:04:09,600
sequence male sexual behavior.

106
00:04:09,601 --> 00:04:14,601
So you can tell the difference
between a male cat with no court tax,

107
00:04:15,371 --> 00:04:15,811
let's say it,

108
00:04:15,811 --> 00:04:17,500
no limbic system and a female cat,

109
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,120
but pretty much only in that,

110
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:20,470
in that particularity.

111
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:21,723
So,

112
00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:22,923
so,

113
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:23,291
you know,

114
00:04:23,291 --> 00:04:23,711
so,

115
00:04:23,711 --> 00:04:25,000
so that's very interesting.

116
00:04:25,001 --> 00:04:25,091
A,

117
00:04:25,091 --> 00:04:25,750
because if you,

118
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:30,750
if you study neuropsychology and you're
taught by clinical neuropsychologist,

119
00:04:31,391 --> 00:04:31,541
say,

120
00:04:31,541 --> 00:04:34,750
or even neuropsychologists that
have a clinical background,

121
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:36,370
they're very cortical centric.

122
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:37,061
You know,

123
00:04:37,061 --> 00:04:37,894
and I think it's,

124
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:39,400
it's part of your hangover.

125
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:39,880
We're,

126
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:40,713
we're,

127
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:41,501
you know,

128
00:04:41,501 --> 00:04:44,710
since we got unseated from our
position at the center of the universe,

129
00:04:44,711 --> 00:04:45,544
we've been,

130
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:45,941
you know,

131
00:04:45,941 --> 00:04:49,180
rat rat radically running around trying
to figure out what it is that makes us

132
00:04:49,181 --> 00:04:51,040
special in relationship to animals.

133
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:53,320
And we kind of cottoned
onto the idea that,

134
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:53,921
you know,

135
00:04:53,921 --> 00:04:57,490
we have this big cortical cap and
especially the prefrontal Cortex,

136
00:04:57,491 --> 00:04:59,740
and it's very large in
relationship to our body,

137
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:00,221
which,

138
00:05:00,221 --> 00:05:01,054
which it is.

139
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:01,541
And that,

140
00:05:01,541 --> 00:05:01,781
you know,

141
00:05:01,781 --> 00:05:04,060
somehow that distinguishes
us from other animals,

142
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:05,290
which it does.

143
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:06,150
But,

144
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:10,810
but that's also led us into thinking that
the most recently evolved parts of the

145
00:05:10,811 --> 00:05:12,670
brain are the most important.

146
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:13,983
It's like,

147
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:14,411
and,

148
00:05:14,411 --> 00:05:16,360
and in some sense the smartest,

149
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:17,141
you know?

150
00:05:17,141 --> 00:05:20,890
But there's a real error of presumption
there because you might also,

151
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:24,820
you might think instead that it's those
parts of the brain that evolution has

152
00:05:24,821 --> 00:05:28,870
had the longest time to work on
that are in fact the smartest,

153
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:29,680
you know?

154
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,750
And they do take care of
all the heavy lifting.

155
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:31,991
You know,

156
00:05:31,991 --> 00:05:32,321
your,

157
00:05:32,321 --> 00:05:32,621
your,

158
00:05:32,621 --> 00:05:33,010
your,

159
00:05:33,010 --> 00:05:36,880
your consciousness isn't entrusted
with any of the heavy lifting.

160
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:38,950
You can fiddle around the edges with it,

161
00:05:38,951 --> 00:05:42,390
but you're not going to be allowed
to do anything that's really PR,

162
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:42,800
you know,

163
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,070
that's really physiologically profound.

164
00:05:45,071 --> 00:05:49,180
And it's a good thing because you just
don't have the intellectual capacity to

165
00:05:49,181 --> 00:05:53,260
manage that kind of ongoing
physiological monitoring.

166
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:53,730
You know?

167
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:56,590
It's like you don't understand
your body if you're lucky,

168
00:05:56,591 --> 00:05:59,080
the thing works and you can
ignore it roughly speaking,

169
00:05:59,081 --> 00:05:59,710
you know?

170
00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:01,150
But if it ever goes wrong,

171
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:03,430
good luck trying to
figure it out consciously.

172
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:03,780
You know?

173
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:04,001
I mean,

174
00:06:04,001 --> 00:06:05,200
we're getting somewhere with that,

175
00:06:05,201 --> 00:06:05,771
but it's very,

176
00:06:05,771 --> 00:06:06,760
very difficult to do.
