1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:04,450
We the product of three and a half
billion years of intimate relationships.

2
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:08,640
So you're not just going
to step outside of that

3
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:11,450
from a different planet,

4
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:12,490
right?

5
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:17,490
Just get down to the fact that that's
part of like fit and you know you want to

6
00:00:17,691 --> 00:00:21,530
have an intimate relationship and I think
one that's longer lasting because you

7
00:00:21,531 --> 00:00:26,531
have your story and it's unfolding in
your partner has her or his story and it's

8
00:00:26,871 --> 00:00:29,660
unfolding and then you weave
those together like a road,

9
00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:30,200
you know,

10
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:31,940
and that makes the story much,

11
00:00:31,941 --> 00:00:32,451
much,

12
00:00:32,451 --> 00:00:36,710
much stronger and it gives
you some continuity but you
like it gives you a past,

13
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:39,830
it's stable and it gives you a presence
that's free on it gives you a future

14
00:00:39,831 --> 00:00:40,510
that's,

15
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:41,210
it's,

16
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:43,340
it's solid and dependable.

17
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:47,690
It's something that you can rely on when
everything around you is moving up and

18
00:00:47,691 --> 00:00:49,040
down far too rapidly.

19
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:50,960
And so you want to solve that problem.

20
00:00:50,961 --> 00:00:53,780
You know what you want to have you and
maybe you want to take one sort of do you

21
00:00:53,781 --> 00:00:55,640
want to have an intimate
relationship with?

22
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:57,530
It's probably not a pushover.

23
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:00,230
You want someone to give you
a good slap when you need one,

24
00:01:00,231 --> 00:01:04,220
which is probably like six or seven
times a day just to ask for one,

25
00:01:04,221 --> 00:01:04,600
right?

26
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:05,660
When you wake up in the morning,

27
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:06,581
that's what you should do.

28
00:01:06,581 --> 00:01:07,670
You should turn to your wife and say,

29
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:11,310
your boss is just sloppy right
now because doesn't deserve it.

30
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:16,110
And so you want someone like that
and then slap him a little better.

31
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:18,930
Then you have some respect
for them too because you,

32
00:01:18,931 --> 00:01:19,181
you know,

33
00:01:19,181 --> 00:01:19,901
you've tried something,

34
00:01:19,901 --> 00:01:21,760
a little trick that you think
I can get away with this.

35
00:01:21,761 --> 00:01:22,360
And it's like,

36
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:22,920
wow,

37
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:24,400
did you I'm there.

38
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:34,160
[inaudible]

39
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:36,181
hey man,

40
00:01:36,181 --> 00:01:36,481
you think,

41
00:01:36,481 --> 00:01:37,314
well,

42
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:38,820
what do you do about temptation?

43
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,320
You know,

44
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:41,490
succumb to it.

45
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,380
That's the wrong answer.

46
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:46,120
What is the reason for that?

47
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:46,610
You know,

48
00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:48,320
cause I can say what you know,

49
00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:50,070
you shouldn't succumb to temptation.

50
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,710
There's sort of a preachy finger waving,

51
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:52,940
thinking that it was all done with that.

52
00:01:52,941 --> 00:01:54,080
But that's not the,

53
00:01:55,130 --> 00:01:58,520
what are the things I've learned about
ethical behavior is the reason you should

54
00:01:58,521 --> 00:02:00,320
act ethically because
there wasn't anything bad,

55
00:02:00,321 --> 00:02:01,990
but you could do like it's,

56
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:06,380
it's bad for you and for the future use
and it's better for your family and it's

57
00:02:06,381 --> 00:02:07,460
better for everyone around you.

58
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:08,780
It's better.

59
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,490
It's not that you shouldn't do it,

60
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:13,220
that's wheat and you
will rebel against that.

61
00:02:13,221 --> 00:02:14,540
Like who says I shouldn't do that?

62
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:15,890
That's not helpful.

63
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:16,281
It's like,

64
00:02:16,281 --> 00:02:16,411
no,

65
00:02:16,411 --> 00:02:16,710
no,

66
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:16,910
you,

67
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:18,890
you want to be sensible about this.

68
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:19,753
You know?

69
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:20,601
Well,

70
00:02:20,601 --> 00:02:22,340
why not take cocaine all the time?

71
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:24,260
Well,

72
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:25,140
I mean it's a real cost.

73
00:02:25,210 --> 00:02:26,500
And the psychologist,

74
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:29,210
how often have this sort of thing
backwards because psychologists,

75
00:02:29,211 --> 00:02:29,411
no,

76
00:02:29,411 --> 00:02:31,570
I trying to tie themselves
up with knots thinking,

77
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:31,661
well,

78
00:02:31,661 --> 00:02:32,840
why are people addicted?

79
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:36,380
So like what sort of
stupid question is that?

80
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:39,890
Tried your substance of choice.

81
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,990
You don't bloody well why
people are addicted to it.

82
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:43,400
It's really fun.

83
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:46,990
Rid of your anxiety.

84
00:02:46,991 --> 00:02:47,680
You don't worry.

85
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:47,891
You know,

86
00:02:47,891 --> 00:02:48,281
it's like,

87
00:02:48,281 --> 00:02:48,770
it's,

88
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:49,140
it's,

89
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:52,080
it's something and you
can get isolated rats.

90
00:02:52,081 --> 00:02:53,050
It didn't fit to Pokemon.

91
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:54,000
You don't time flat.

92
00:02:54,001 --> 00:02:55,590
So there's no mystery about addiction.

93
00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:58,950
The beneficiary is why aren't you
addicted to doing impulsive things all the

94
00:02:58,960 --> 00:02:59,793
time?

95
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:01,510
Some of you probably are,

96
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:02,483
but,

97
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:03,881
but the problem is,

98
00:03:03,881 --> 00:03:05,450
you know what the
consequences of that are.

99
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:09,670
It's a very short trip down hill and
it's because what you're doing is

100
00:03:09,671 --> 00:03:12,490
maximizing pleasure in the moment,

101
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:16,600
but for going stability
and achievement and,

102
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:19,120
and everything's solid really
the medium to long term.

103
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:22,840
And so it's a pleasurable degenerated
came and you had definitely a terrible

104
00:03:22,841 --> 00:03:23,830
place if that happens.

105
00:03:23,831 --> 00:03:28,831
So you have to figure out how to regulate
temptation because it'll offer you and

106
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:30,430
that doesn't work.

107
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:32,020
So you know,

108
00:03:32,021 --> 00:03:34,420
you have to regulate your
alcoholic take if you have to be.

109
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:35,950
Some of the really likes alcohol,

110
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:40,150
if you're into recreational drugs
or casual sex or anything like that,

111
00:03:40,151 --> 00:03:41,050
or pornography,

112
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:45,790
all these places that you could slide
into that maximize immediate reward but

113
00:03:45,791 --> 00:03:46,810
costs you in the long run.

114
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:48,250
You have to have strategy for that.

115
00:03:48,251 --> 00:03:48,820
It's like,

116
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:50,980
why should I drink every night?

117
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:52,570
You need a reason for that.

118
00:03:52,571 --> 00:03:55,630
And the answer is something like
it's gotta be something like,

119
00:03:56,210 --> 00:03:57,490
I got better things to do.

120
00:03:58,090 --> 00:03:58,990
That's the right answer.

121
00:03:58,991 --> 00:04:00,520
I've got better things to do than that.

122
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:01,743
So,

123
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,640
and then what else do you need to know?

124
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:05,970
What are you going to
do with your life folks?

125
00:04:05,971 --> 00:04:08,740
I get work and I don't mean hobby Jesus.

126
00:04:08,741 --> 00:04:09,401
That's bad.

127
00:04:09,401 --> 00:04:10,590
That's a bad way of thinking about it.

128
00:04:10,591 --> 00:04:11,950
Like it's good if you have a hobby,

129
00:04:11,951 --> 00:04:15,340
but that isn't what you think about
doing with your time outside of work.

130
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:17,110
It's like that's your life.

131
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:22,410
It's like what meaningful and productive
engagements are you going to set up for

132
00:04:23,861 --> 00:04:28,861
yourself so that so that you're so
that you can tolerate your existence.

133
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:29,690
You know,

134
00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:33,970
because one of the things the existential
psychologist pointed out the 1950s and

135
00:04:33,971 --> 00:04:35,340
they were sort of suffering from,

136
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:36,671
what would you call it,

137
00:04:36,671 --> 00:04:40,330
cognitive aftermath of World War II and
all the horrors that were revealed the

138
00:04:40,331 --> 00:04:41,660
World War Two is that they're,

139
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:44,680
their realization was that human
beings owned something like a debt to

140
00:04:44,681 --> 00:04:45,760
existence.

141
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:50,940
You know you have to pay the price for
your wretched existence and the pay that

142
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:51,731
price property.

143
00:04:51,731 --> 00:04:54,910
You have to be doing something noble and
worthwhile and some of that's going to

144
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:57,220
be your career and your relationship
with your family and all that,

145
00:04:57,221 --> 00:05:00,310
but you need to have a vision
for what it is that you're up to.

146
00:05:00,311 --> 00:05:02,200
When you're not otherwise engaged,

147
00:05:02,201 --> 00:05:05,080
what is it that you could be doing in
the world that would be worth getting up

148
00:05:05,081 --> 00:05:06,610
for even when you're not well,

149
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:07,660
even when you're suffering,

150
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:09,760
even when someone close to you has died,

151
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:10,420
right?

152
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:12,040
Even in the depths of tragedy,

153
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:14,170
what is it that you are going
to engage yourself with?

154
00:05:14,171 --> 00:05:15,070
It makes you think,

155
00:05:15,071 --> 00:05:15,730
God dammit,

156
00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:16,210
man,

157
00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:17,050
this is a rough day,

158
00:05:17,051 --> 00:05:19,530
but I'm getting the hell out of India.

159
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:21,340
That's not being happy,

160
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:22,001
right?

161
00:05:22,001 --> 00:05:23,710
This way more than being happy.

162
00:05:23,711 --> 00:05:25,690
This is what you do when you're not happy,

163
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:30,040
and that happens to a lot in your life
and you need an answer to that question

164
00:05:30,041 --> 00:05:34,630
for the times when things are really damp
and dread and so you need to know what

165
00:05:34,631 --> 00:05:35,620
you wear.

166
00:05:35,621 --> 00:05:36,040
What are the,

167
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,580
where you're situated yourself.

168
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:40,090
One thing you can think of
is that while you could,

169
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:43,720
you could think about trying to make the
world a slightly less miserable place.

170
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:44,231
You know,

171
00:05:44,231 --> 00:05:46,430
that's not a bad place to start
if you don't know what to do.

172
00:05:46,431 --> 00:05:49,450
And there's lots of things out there
that aren't very good that you could

173
00:05:49,451 --> 00:05:52,360
probably help a little bit
if you got your act together.

174
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:53,710
And so if you don't know what to do,

175
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:54,251
you can take,

176
00:05:54,251 --> 00:05:55,510
well you don't,

177
00:05:55,570 --> 00:05:56,750
there's a problem out there.

178
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,230
The whatever problem comes
to mind for you to take.

179
00:06:00,231 --> 00:06:05,231
Well I can probably dare trying to solve
that at a small level badly so that I

180
00:06:07,071 --> 00:06:07,970
get better at it.

181
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:08,840
And then,

182
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:09,131
you know,

183
00:06:09,131 --> 00:06:09,460
when,

184
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:11,270
when things are falling apart around me,

185
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:12,051
I can hit me say,

186
00:06:12,051 --> 00:06:12,291
look,

187
00:06:12,291 --> 00:06:15,920
I've got this and this is
how I'm contributing and
that's a killer that you can

188
00:06:15,921 --> 00:06:18,260
rest on when things are falling apart.

189
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:19,610
It need that.

190
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:21,053
And so

191
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:25,591
education,

192
00:06:25,591 --> 00:06:25,901
so like,

193
00:06:25,901 --> 00:06:26,171
okay,

194
00:06:26,171 --> 00:06:27,430
well you don't,

195
00:06:27,431 --> 00:06:27,710
you don't,

196
00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:28,600
you don't do enough.

197
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:33,160
Obviously if that's a bad thing because
the world's complicated and the more you

198
00:06:33,161 --> 00:06:33,341
know,

199
00:06:33,341 --> 00:06:36,220
the less it's going to flap you horribly.

200
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:39,070
And so it's good to educate yourself.

201
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:42,070
So you might have a plan for that too so
that you can be a little bit more than

202
00:06:42,071 --> 00:06:44,050
you are everyday.

203
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:46,150
And so I wrote a little about that too,

204
00:06:46,151 --> 00:06:49,240
which was comparing yourself to who
you were yesterday and not to who,

205
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:50,920
who someone else's today,

206
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:56,250
which I wrote that rule very carefully
because you need to have a name and if

207
00:06:56,801 --> 00:06:57,700
you have any infant stuff,

208
00:06:57,701 --> 00:06:59,500
people are going to be
better at that than you.

209
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:01,030
And then you get all emptiness about it.

210
00:07:01,031 --> 00:07:02,040
And not only entities,

211
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:05,020
but pretty hard on yourself because like
you're just not where you should be in

212
00:07:05,021 --> 00:07:06,250
relationship to that aim.

213
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:09,790
And that can make you very
bitter displeased with the world.

214
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:12,310
But it's not a good way of
looking at it that it's,

215
00:07:12,311 --> 00:07:14,770
it's even though you need
that value structure,

216
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:15,870
you needed up,

217
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:17,290
you need people who are above.

218
00:07:17,291 --> 00:07:17,680
You need to,

219
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,720
because at least their
targets for emulation.

220
00:07:19,930 --> 00:07:21,010
But you can always fake.

221
00:07:21,011 --> 00:07:21,370
Well,

222
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:21,641
you know,

223
00:07:21,641 --> 00:07:26,230
here I am now in my wretched
form and without my false,

224
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:26,871
uh,

225
00:07:26,871 --> 00:07:30,220
tomorrow I could be one 10th of 1% better.

226
00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:32,080
That's pretty good thing,

227
00:07:32,081 --> 00:07:32,351
you know,

228
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:34,960
because you've got yourself
as the target and you know,

229
00:07:34,961 --> 00:07:37,060
you can be slightly better than you are.

230
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:38,103
And then as you do that,

231
00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:41,590
and that does make you bitter or resentful
to notice that you could be slightly

232
00:07:41,591 --> 00:07:42,281
better than you are.

233
00:07:42,281 --> 00:07:43,690
It's actually kind of hopeful,

234
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:44,440
you know,

235
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:45,273
because,

236
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:48,700
well that's a pathway to improvement
and so that's a good thing.

237
00:07:49,090 --> 00:07:54,090
And so you just started to do that as a
meaningful way of engaging in the world.

238
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:56,460
Okay.

239
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:58,320
That's a good thing to do
with your time outside of her.

240
00:07:58,321 --> 00:07:58,831
So anyways,

241
00:07:58,831 --> 00:08:02,310
I laid all this out and this writing
program and so then the kids would write

242
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:07,020
their plan and it was really interesting
watching this because this just blew me

243
00:08:07,021 --> 00:08:07,854
away.

244
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:08,933
It was like,

245
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:10,640
okay,

246
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:12,190
I don't know how to describe it either.

247
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:13,700
It's like you don't,

248
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:14,240
you know,

249
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,920
when you look back at the past,

250
00:08:15,921 --> 00:08:18,650
you see the people had huge blind
spots in their culture and you thought,

251
00:08:18,651 --> 00:08:21,650
well how the hell can people not
notice that that was the case,

252
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:22,040
you know,

253
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,510
but here's something we don't do.

254
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:24,920
These students,

255
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:27,350
they have been in school
for like 60 years,

256
00:08:27,351 --> 00:08:27,980
you know,

257
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:30,620
and they were pretty
top of the rug students,

258
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:31,550
smart,

259
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:32,630
hardworking,

260
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:33,613
most of them,

261
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:35,030
the vast majority of it,

262
00:08:35,031 --> 00:08:37,450
cause the u of t is actually a
very conservative institution.

263
00:08:37,670 --> 00:08:40,520
There's a lot of children are
first generation immigrants
there and they're like

264
00:08:40,910 --> 00:08:43,550
pretty desperate about the job market
and they're hitting their books pretty

265
00:08:43,551 --> 00:08:43,851
hard.

266
00:08:43,851 --> 00:08:47,810
So these are kids who have
their eye on the prize mostly.

267
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:53,350
No one had ever sat them down in their
entire life and ask them to spend like an

268
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:58,890
hour writing what sort of and they
want it to be and why you ain't go,

269
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,150
what the hell?

270
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:01,560
What's going on with that?

271
00:09:01,561 --> 00:09:06,090
It's like how could we possibly have
constructed an education system that would

272
00:09:06,091 --> 00:09:11,091
just spent 15 years trying to help
people become educated and never once get

273
00:09:11,971 --> 00:09:16,971
them to think hard about who the hell
they want it to be up to justify that.

274
00:09:18,631 --> 00:09:19,740
And you need to justify it,

275
00:09:19,741 --> 00:09:19,921
right?

276
00:09:19,921 --> 00:09:24,000
Because imagine you lay out a path
and then you get all doubtful about it

277
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:24,811
because you will,

278
00:09:24,811 --> 00:09:27,300
especially if it's a difficult
path and you run into challenges,

279
00:09:27,301 --> 00:09:29,190
know that you're all done.

280
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:31,020
All that potential you have for thought.

281
00:09:31,021 --> 00:09:33,900
He's going to go after your planning
like mad and try to bring you down.

282
00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:34,830
That's your doubts.

283
00:09:34,831 --> 00:09:37,350
It's like you need some
arguments for those doubts.

284
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:40,620
You need like six reasons why
what you're doing is a good idea.

285
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:41,910
So when those doubts come up,

286
00:09:41,911 --> 00:09:42,360
you can say,

287
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:42,770
no,

288
00:09:42,770 --> 00:09:42,931
no,

289
00:09:42,931 --> 00:09:43,320
no,

290
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,153
that's wrong.

291
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:47,380
I'm doing this cause I got these six
reasons that I'm doing this because I

292
00:09:47,381 --> 00:09:49,130
thought it all the way down to the bottom.

293
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,080
And if someone gets in your
way in an inappropriate way,

294
00:09:52,081 --> 00:09:52,980
it's the same thing.

295
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:55,680
And if you have six reasons
for what you're doing,

296
00:09:55,710 --> 00:09:59,280
no one will ever stop you
because they'll Jack Day,

297
00:09:59,340 --> 00:09:59,521
well,

298
00:09:59,521 --> 00:10:00,660
why aren't you doing that?

299
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:01,221
He said,

300
00:10:01,221 --> 00:10:01,351
well,

301
00:10:01,351 --> 00:10:01,861
I don't know.

302
00:10:01,861 --> 00:10:04,830
It's like you lose you've and you say,

303
00:10:04,831 --> 00:10:04,981
well,

304
00:10:04,981 --> 00:10:05,940
here's the reason.

305
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:06,601
And they say,

306
00:10:06,601 --> 00:10:06,751
well,

307
00:10:06,751 --> 00:10:08,340
how do you justify that?

308
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:09,091
And you go,

309
00:10:09,091 --> 00:10:09,420
well,

310
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:10,560
I have this reason.

311
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:11,341
And then they say,

312
00:10:11,341 --> 00:10:12,174
well,

313
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:13,103
you're a pretty smart,

314
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,370
how do you justify that?

315
00:10:14,371 --> 00:10:15,690
And you have two other reasons isn't.

316
00:10:15,810 --> 00:10:17,580
Then they get angry and go away

317
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:22,740
and you went for the [inaudible] gets

318
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:28,121
right.

319
00:10:28,121 --> 00:10:31,060
This as well as part of
this narrative courts.

320
00:10:31,061 --> 00:10:31,900
And so again,

321
00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:32,950
they're writing like math,

322
00:10:32,951 --> 00:10:34,180
like 15,000 words,

323
00:10:34,181 --> 00:10:34,780
you know?

324
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:35,090
And He's,

325
00:10:35,090 --> 00:10:35,690
they tell me,

326
00:10:35,690 --> 00:10:37,570
this is taking way longer than I thought.

327
00:10:37,571 --> 00:10:37,870
It was.

328
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:38,201
Just like,

329
00:10:38,201 --> 00:10:38,471
well,

330
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:38,681
you know,

331
00:10:38,681 --> 00:10:39,370
it's your life.

332
00:10:39,370 --> 00:10:40,203
You don't sweat.

333
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:41,810
Do it as,

334
00:10:41,810 --> 00:10:43,240
do it as thoroughly as you can.

335
00:10:43,241 --> 00:10:44,240
But I used to tell him to do,

336
00:10:44,241 --> 00:10:46,150
and this is a really good
thing to know as well,

337
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:51,040
you can write a really bad plan for your
life and that's way better than no plan

338
00:10:51,041 --> 00:10:51,730
at all.

339
00:10:51,730 --> 00:10:54,760
And so if you're going to figure
out what you're going to do,

340
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:55,870
you're going to be wrong.

341
00:10:55,930 --> 00:10:59,590
And so you don't have to get
all perfectionistic about
it because what the hell

342
00:10:59,591 --> 00:11:00,400
do you know?

343
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:03,730
You're going to chart your course and
then you're going to move forward in the

344
00:11:03,731 --> 00:11:07,780
world and you're going to occur experience
as a consequence of moving forward.

345
00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:10,390
And then that's good if you would like
to do enough so you be able to make a

346
00:11:10,391 --> 00:11:11,224
better plan.

347
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:14,110
So all you have to do is make a plant
that's good enough so that it gets you to

348
00:11:14,111 --> 00:11:15,100
your next plan.

349
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:19,540
And I've also watched people for decades
now they've asked me questions like

350
00:11:19,541 --> 00:11:19,930
that,

351
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:21,640
but what should I do if
I don't know what to do?

352
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,340
And that's where is don't wait around.

353
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:28,780
All you do is getting old and you get
old way faster than you think and you'd

354
00:11:28,781 --> 00:11:31,150
like your 25 one day and
then you're 40 the next.

355
00:11:31,151 --> 00:11:34,870
And if you're still 25 when
you're 40 that's an ugly thing.

356
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:37,780
It's an upbeat and you're not
going to be happy about it.

357
00:11:37,781 --> 00:11:39,670
So make a stupid plan.

358
00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:40,660
And implemented,

359
00:11:40,810 --> 00:11:42,530
get bashed around by the world,

360
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:45,280
it'll tell you what your plan is
wrong and then you can reformulate it.

361
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:46,650
And so had freezy off her bed.

362
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:46,901
It's like,

363
00:11:46,901 --> 00:11:47,650
well,

364
00:11:47,650 --> 00:11:49,540
not that smart and I'm not that wise,

365
00:11:49,541 --> 00:11:53,020
but I can make a tentative
plan as long as I stand back,

366
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:54,640
watch while I'm implementing it,

367
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:57,070
maybe I could learn enough
to get to the next step.

368
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:57,531
And that,

369
00:11:57,531 --> 00:11:58,120
that's fine.

370
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:58,811
That's perfect.

371
00:11:58,811 --> 00:11:58,920
It's,

372
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:00,580
so that's a good thing to know.

373
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:02,170
So the kids really liked that.

374
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:03,213
And so,

375
00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:05,650
so then I got together with
my partners and we thought,

376
00:12:05,651 --> 00:12:05,771
well,

377
00:12:05,771 --> 00:12:07,390
why don't we try this on a larger scale?

378
00:12:07,391 --> 00:12:08,020
We'll just,

379
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:11,260
we'll just build an exercise that
people can do online at guided writing

380
00:12:11,261 --> 00:12:13,080
exercise and uh,

381
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:14,950
let people try it and see what happens.

382
00:12:14,951 --> 00:12:17,590
So we tested it at Mcgill University.

383
00:12:17,591 --> 00:12:18,640
First we did a,

384
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:20,740
we got these 80 kids who,

385
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:23,260
who weren't doing well academically.

386
00:12:23,261 --> 00:12:24,730
So they were on academic probation.

387
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,970
Now these are kids who had done pretty
well in university or high school because

388
00:12:27,971 --> 00:12:29,230
they put the got into McGill otherwise,

389
00:12:29,231 --> 00:12:30,760
so they all had an eastern 80 average.

390
00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:33,340
They didn't have
intellectual shortcomings,

391
00:12:33,341 --> 00:12:36,580
but you know the first year or two at
university can be rough because you're

392
00:12:36,581 --> 00:12:39,280
adapting to the transformation
of your life and all of that.

393
00:12:39,610 --> 00:12:43,990
And so then we put the kids into group
one of two groups randomly at one group

394
00:12:43,991 --> 00:12:48,991
was right about you did a bunch of self
analysis exercises and a bunch of a

395
00:12:50,081 --> 00:12:51,520
bunch of writing about who you were,

396
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,980
but it was all like questionnaire base.

397
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:57,150
And then the other one was this free
writing exercise that was structured but

398
00:12:57,170 --> 00:12:59,950
help you outline what I just
mentioned about your future.

399
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:01,090
So the rest of the future,

400
00:13:01,091 --> 00:13:02,040
all three exercises.

401
00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:02,261
Okay,

402
00:13:02,261 --> 00:13:02,961
so you answer those,

403
00:13:02,961 --> 00:13:03,910
set the questions,

404
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:08,050
then you develop a conceptualization of
what you'd like your life to be at three

405
00:13:08,051 --> 00:13:11,140
to five years and you write about that
for 20 minutes and you don't get too

406
00:13:11,141 --> 00:13:11,910
obsessive about it.

407
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:12,221
Just think,

408
00:13:12,221 --> 00:13:12,461
okay,

409
00:13:12,461 --> 00:13:16,600
if I could have what I needed
to justify my existence,

410
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:18,010
what would it look like?

411
00:13:18,070 --> 00:13:19,180
And then the second half is,

412
00:13:19,181 --> 00:13:19,451
okay,

413
00:13:19,451 --> 00:13:22,120
well now that you've got
your vision in place,

414
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:25,000
how about a strategy plan and strategy?

415
00:13:25,330 --> 00:13:26,800
So that that was the whole exercise.

416
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:28,540
So we had kids in the guilty.

417
00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:29,403
This,

418
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:34,440
it produced a 30% decline in their
probability of dropping the university.

419
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:38,410
So that just blew us away.

420
00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:39,440
What was the question?

421
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,273
Hopefully for right,

422
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:43,030
but at 25% improvement in her.

423
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:45,460
So pool

424
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:47,590
but also kind of sad because you think,

425
00:13:47,591 --> 00:13:49,090
well look,

426
00:13:49,091 --> 00:13:52,750
I mean all of that had to happen was these
kids had to have a plan and then I'll

427
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:56,050
then they weren't like flapping about
uselessly and blowing in the wind.

428
00:13:56,410 --> 00:13:57,100
You think,

429
00:13:57,100 --> 00:14:00,820
would it be good if someone wouldn't be
helping him develop a damn plan for like

430
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:04,840
a third of the time thing where
it's school so they would just home,

431
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:05,380
right?

432
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:07,660
They had a vision of who
they want it to be wide,

433
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:10,510
how would they were going to take their
place in the world and we're encouraged

434
00:14:10,511 --> 00:14:13,360
to think that that is a worthwhile
endeavor and that there were,

435
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:13,840
there were,

436
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:17,920
there were great things to do that they
could be doing even on a local scale,

437
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:20,650
like being a good husband or
a good wife or a good father,

438
00:14:20,651 --> 00:14:21,400
a good mother.

439
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:25,870
These are not trivial things are not
trivial things that people should think

440
00:14:25,871 --> 00:14:28,150
about them seriously and they
should take them seriously.

441
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:29,380
Or to be a good neighbor,

442
00:14:29,381 --> 00:14:30,214
a good friend,

443
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:32,080
or to be successful in your career,

444
00:14:32,081 --> 00:14:32,914
which is what then,

445
00:14:33,070 --> 00:14:33,311
you know,

446
00:14:33,311 --> 00:14:35,860
we really promote in our
culture and fair enough,

447
00:14:35,861 --> 00:14:37,030
but it's not everything.

448
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:41,230
So are things to do in the world that
need to be done and there are problems

449
00:14:41,231 --> 00:14:43,870
that need to be solved and there's
enough prompts for everybody.

450
00:14:43,871 --> 00:14:44,620
So,

451
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:44,861
you know,

452
00:14:44,861 --> 00:14:47,200
it'd be really good if we could
tell our kids to get the hell,

453
00:14:47,201 --> 00:14:49,870
get their act together and get the
hell out there and do something useful.

454
00:14:49,871 --> 00:14:51,560
And it's really good for them to that.

455
00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:52,470
And so,

456
00:14:52,470 --> 00:14:54,110
so then if you get them to do that,

457
00:14:54,111 --> 00:14:54,321
say,

458
00:14:54,321 --> 00:14:54,560
well,

459
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,490
make a plan.

460
00:14:55,990 --> 00:14:56,320
Poof.

461
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,670
There are 30% less likely to
drop out of the university.

462
00:14:58,671 --> 00:15:00,410
So we're pretty happy about this.

463
00:15:00,411 --> 00:15:01,730
But he's a small study,

464
00:15:01,731 --> 00:15:02,120
you know,

465
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:04,760
40 and 40 maybe it only worked at McGill,

466
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:05,540
who knows.

467
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:07,660
So then we went to Holland woman there,

468
00:15:07,690 --> 00:15:09,020
pop the shippers.

469
00:15:09,290 --> 00:15:09,860
She,

470
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:10,191
she,

471
00:15:10,191 --> 00:15:10,550
uh,

472
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:13,790
was a professor at the Rotterdam
School of Management and she,

473
00:15:13,791 --> 00:15:14,624
um,

474
00:15:14,930 --> 00:15:17,780
she decided that she would do this with
all the first year business students.

475
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:19,550
And so there's like a thousand of them.

476
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:23,030
And so they just did it as
part of a course assignment.

477
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:24,380
No instruction.

478
00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:27,050
They just have the program
says write about your future.

479
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,910
And so they aren't worried
about their future.

480
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:33,020
Say thing happened at about
a 30% decline and drop up.

481
00:15:33,170 --> 00:15:36,290
But we did a little bit more
distinct analysis this talk.

482
00:15:36,291 --> 00:15:41,291
So we stratified that the
people into sex and ethnicity,

483
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:42,860
just a rough cut.

484
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:47,510
So we use Ben and women and
we used western Westerners,

485
00:15:47,570 --> 00:15:51,620
the Dutch basically Dutch nationals
and non western ethic wine words.

486
00:15:51,770 --> 00:15:53,210
And so that would be four categories.

487
00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:56,780
And then we looked out there their
previous academic achievement.

488
00:15:56,810 --> 00:16:01,310
And so the people who are doing the best
were the Dutch women and then the ducks

489
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:01,880
ma'am.

490
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:05,080
And then the non Western ethnic minority
women and then the northern ethnic

491
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:09,020
Western minority men and the no on
ethnic western on minority net were

492
00:16:09,021 --> 00:16:11,990
underperforming the
women by about 80% wall.

493
00:16:11,991 --> 00:16:12,980
A big difference.

494
00:16:13,370 --> 00:16:17,870
Now there was hundreds of people and
we tested thousands of people in these

495
00:16:17,871 --> 00:16:18,261
samples.

496
00:16:18,261 --> 00:16:19,040
So the samples,

497
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,210
saplings were very stable.

498
00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:21,890
We did it over a number of years.

499
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,800
And so we fucking two things.

500
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:27,470
The first thing is it had a
bigger effect on men and on women.

501
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:30,980
Now we think that's because the
women are already doing better.

502
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:32,150
And so if you're,

503
00:16:32,330 --> 00:16:35,990
if you're kind of set on something and
you have a plaid that maybe making a plan

504
00:16:35,991 --> 00:16:36,890
doesn't help that much,

505
00:16:36,891 --> 00:16:38,270
but if you don't have a plan,

506
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:39,590
it really helps.

507
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,510
But this was the coolest thing.

508
00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:46,520
Two years after the group
did this study did the,

509
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:48,500
did the exercise,

510
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:51,770
the not western ethnic minority men
were outperforming the Dutch women.

511
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:53,570
So yeah,

512
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:53,930
yeah.

513
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:55,580
There were hundreds of
them in this sample.

514
00:16:55,581 --> 00:16:57,140
So it was a robust result.

515
00:16:57,170 --> 00:17:01,100
And so that just blew us away because
for a bunch of reasons was first of all,

516
00:17:01,101 --> 00:17:03,440
well imagine if you're an
immigrant to a new culture,

517
00:17:03,441 --> 00:17:04,580
you're pretty disoriented,

518
00:17:04,610 --> 00:17:05,000
right?

519
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,070
Obviously cause that's
part of being an immigrant.

520
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:10,970
And so maybe it's even more important
for you to get your bearings and figure

521
00:17:10,971 --> 00:17:12,290
out what you're doing and why.

522
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:13,520
So about,

523
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:14,180
so that was,

524
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:15,260
that's one possible reason.

525
00:17:15,261 --> 00:17:17,420
But the other thing that was
so cool is you always hear,

526
00:17:17,450 --> 00:17:20,360
especially in our culture now with its
idiot political correctness and its

527
00:17:20,361 --> 00:17:21,120
identity,

528
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:22,870
guess that the reason or

529
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,020
corrupt sociologists,

530
00:17:28,021 --> 00:17:28,530
geological

531
00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:30,240
conditions of the society,

532
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:33,810
and obviously there's some truth in that
because every society is ethnocentric

533
00:17:33,811 --> 00:17:37,020
at parochial to some degree
in favor of the majority.

534
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:39,390
It's almost like the
definition of society.

535
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:42,960
But here we get a psychological
intervention and it
completely obliterated the

536
00:17:42,961 --> 00:17:45,240
sociological effects completely.

537
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:46,410
And so that was,

538
00:17:46,410 --> 00:17:47,340
that was just,

539
00:17:47,390 --> 00:17:47,880
well,

540
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:48,151
you know,

541
00:17:48,151 --> 00:17:49,050
you don't as a,

542
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:53,130
you don't feel like doing a
football touchdown dance very often.

543
00:17:53,131 --> 00:17:55,710
You don't see scientists in the
hallway doing that sort of thing,

544
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:56,280
you know?

545
00:17:56,280 --> 00:18:01,020
But that was something that we didn't
expect that was really reliable and it was

546
00:18:01,021 --> 00:18:02,370
an absolutely excellent.

547
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:03,623
And so,

548
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:08,660
and then recently we did the same
thing at Mohawk college in Canada.

549
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:14,140
We had the kids come in and get prepared
for university and their orientation,

550
00:18:14,141 --> 00:18:17,940
and they can either do the future
authoring exercise for only 90 minutes.

551
00:18:17,941 --> 00:18:20,040
They just sit down at the
computer and get it cold.

552
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:22,710
They didn't even know they were going to
be doing it as part of the [inaudible].

553
00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:24,870
Well maybe they have
[inaudible] form only,

554
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:28,200
only minimally or they get some
other exercise for 90 minutes.

555
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:31,470
It dropped the dropout rate
of Ben in the first semester.

556
00:18:31,471 --> 00:18:34,890
50% 50% yeah.

557
00:18:35,170 --> 00:18:36,003
So

558
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:38,640
that part as well.

559
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:42,240
And so if you have done
very well in high school,

560
00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:43,980
it had a walloping effect on you.

561
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:48,390
And if you also were in a program
that didn't have like a professional

562
00:18:49,050 --> 00:18:50,550
designation at the end,

563
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,800
so it was like a general arts program,

564
00:18:52,890 --> 00:18:54,920
then it also really had
a whopping effect on you.

565
00:18:54,930 --> 00:18:59,160
So basically it was a program that was
really good for people who have been

566
00:18:59,161 --> 00:19:02,850
doing very well because they were kind
of lost and still hadn't specified a

567
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:06,150
future 50% decrease in
dropout in the first semester.

568
00:19:06,570 --> 00:19:06,871
So,

569
00:19:06,871 --> 00:19:07,141
okay.

570
00:19:07,141 --> 00:19:09,900
Now the reason I'm telling you
all that for a specific reason,

571
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:15,060
and the reason is associated with this
rule can be precise in your speech.

572
00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:16,720
Um,

573
00:19:17,610 --> 00:19:19,810
you're not going to get what
you want those to specifier.

574
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:21,653
That's the first thing.

575
00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:24,030
And there's a real reason for that,

576
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:25,140
is that like,

577
00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:29,550
you actually create the
world by specifying it in a
much deeper sense than you

578
00:19:29,551 --> 00:19:30,060
think.

579
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:33,600
So I'll tell you the story about how
psychologists discovered that because this

580
00:19:33,601 --> 00:19:36,990
is one of the great scientific discovery
stories that you would say for the last

581
00:19:36,991 --> 00:19:37,800
20 years.

582
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,810
Some of you probably know
about this experiment already,

583
00:19:39,811 --> 00:19:42,840
but I don't think you necessarily
know how revolutionary it was.

584
00:19:43,110 --> 00:19:43,761
Scott named,

585
00:19:43,761 --> 00:19:44,100
uh,

586
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:46,320
Dan Simon did these experiments.

587
00:19:46,321 --> 00:19:48,360
He published a paper
called gorillas in that,

588
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:49,240
in our,

589
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:51,050
it's a study.
