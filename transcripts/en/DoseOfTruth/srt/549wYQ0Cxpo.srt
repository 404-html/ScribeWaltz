1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:04,110
You don't know what's possible and
you're not as much as you could be.

2
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:06,810
And so God only knows what you could,

3
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:11,840
what you could do and have and give
if you sacrificed everything to it.

4
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:17,030
And that's the reason that Abraham
is constantly making sacrifices.

5
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:18,001
It's archaic,

6
00:00:18,001 --> 00:00:18,181
right?

7
00:00:18,181 --> 00:00:20,400
He's burning up like baby lambs,

8
00:00:20,401 --> 00:00:21,234
but like,

9
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:21,781
well,

10
00:00:21,781 --> 00:00:22,470
they're alive.

11
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:22,711
You know,

12
00:00:22,711 --> 00:00:24,660
that's something and they're valuable.

13
00:00:24,661 --> 00:00:25,550
And that's something it's,

14
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:27,090
you have to admit,

15
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:29,130
even if you think about
it as a modern person,

16
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:34,370
that the act of sacrificing something
might have some dramatic compulsion to it.

17
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:34,861
You know,

18
00:00:34,861 --> 00:00:38,550
to go out into a flock and to take
something that's newborn and to cut its

19
00:00:38,551 --> 00:00:40,170
throat into bleed it into burn.

20
00:00:40,171 --> 00:00:44,340
It might be a way of
indicating to yourself that
you're actually serious about

21
00:00:44,341 --> 00:00:45,174
something.

22
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:49,050
And it isn't so obvious that we have
rituals of seriousness like that now.

23
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:52,170
And so it's not so obvious that we're
actually serious about anything.

24
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,150
And so maybe that's not such a good thing.

25
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:57,360
And so maybe we shouldn't be thinking
that these people were so archaic and

26
00:00:57,361 --> 00:00:58,800
primitive and superstitious.

27
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:01,200
It's possible that they knew
something that we don't.

28
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:04,110
And certainly in the Abrahamic stories,

29
00:01:04,111 --> 00:01:08,000
one of the things that maintains
Abraham's covenant with God is continually

30
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:09,450
willingness to sacrifice it.

31
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:14,040
It's so that sacrificial issue is so
important because you are not committed to

32
00:01:14,041 --> 00:01:16,260
something unless you're
willing to sacrifice for it.

33
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:20,540
Commitment and sacrifice are
the same thing and I think it's,

34
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:25,680
it borders on miraculous that
those concepts are embedded
into this narrative at

35
00:01:25,681 --> 00:01:27,300
the level of dramatic action.

36
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:27,511
You know,

37
00:01:27,511 --> 00:01:29,370
instead of abstract explanation,

38
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:31,600
people are acting this out and the,

39
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:34,560
and the fundamental conception is
so profound that it's really quite,

40
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:36,750
it's quite are inspiring.

41
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:38,490
It's breathtaking really.

42
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:42,360
When you understand what message
is trying to be conveyed,

43
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,750
you have to make sacrifices and
what do you have to sacrifice?

44
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:50,990
You have to sacrifice that which is most
valuable to you currently that stopping

45
00:01:51,481 --> 00:01:53,940
you and God only knows what that is.

46
00:01:53,941 --> 00:01:55,800
It's certainly the worst of you.

47
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:59,940
It's certainly that and god only knows
to what degree you're in love with the

48
00:01:59,941 --> 00:02:02,190
worst of you so

49
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:04,351
well,

50
00:02:04,351 --> 00:02:07,510
so you moved from the unbearable
present to the ideal future and,

51
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:09,570
and you can't help that.

52
00:02:09,571 --> 00:02:11,190
You have to live in a structure like that,

53
00:02:11,191 --> 00:02:11,941
that's your house.

54
00:02:11,941 --> 00:02:13,320
That's another way of thinking about it.

55
00:02:13,321 --> 00:02:15,150
And if you want to get
your house in order,

56
00:02:15,151 --> 00:02:18,480
and if you want it to be a place
that you can live properly,

57
00:02:18,481 --> 00:02:22,230
then you have to plan the future.

58
00:02:22,231 --> 00:02:24,570
That is perfect.

59
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:26,281
And then I think,

60
00:02:26,281 --> 00:02:27,114
well,

61
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:28,260
what does that mean?

62
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:30,360
It means it's good for you.

63
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:31,261
Right?

64
00:02:31,261 --> 00:02:32,740
And one of the things that I,

65
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:33,480
I'm,

66
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:37,110
I do all the time with my clinical and
consulting clients is try to figure out

67
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:38,430
what would be good for them.

68
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:40,260
But we do more than that.

69
00:02:40,261 --> 00:02:40,801
We try to think,

70
00:02:40,801 --> 00:02:41,041
okay,

71
00:02:41,041 --> 00:02:41,401
well what,

72
00:02:41,401 --> 00:02:43,800
how can we set this up so
it's really good for you?

73
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:47,700
And that all of the side consequences of
that are things that are good for other

74
00:02:47,701 --> 00:02:48,534
people.

75
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:52,530
And so because people are often also
timid about trying to get something that's

76
00:02:52,531 --> 00:02:55,170
good for themselves because they feel
that it's selfish or that they don't

77
00:02:55,171 --> 00:02:56,004
deserve it.

78
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:57,060
So we set it up so that,

79
00:02:57,061 --> 00:02:57,751
well look,

80
00:02:57,751 --> 00:03:02,560
we're going to set it up so that it's
plainly obvious that this will not harm

81
00:03:02,561 --> 00:03:04,060
the structure of the universe.

82
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:08,380
For you to have what you need and to do
it in a way that's of benefit to other

83
00:03:08,381 --> 00:03:08,710
people.

84
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:11,080
There's no downside to that.

85
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:12,940
And so it's okay.

86
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:14,590
It's okay if you reach out and take that.

87
00:03:14,591 --> 00:03:17,890
And one of the things that's
interesting about the biblical stories,

88
00:03:17,891 --> 00:03:19,120
Abrahamic stories as well,

89
00:03:19,121 --> 00:03:23,290
is that God doesn't really seem to be
opposed to this success of the people that

90
00:03:23,291 --> 00:03:24,190
he's chosen.

91
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:25,001
You know,

92
00:03:25,001 --> 00:03:26,180
what happens to them as,

93
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:28,240
as they progress through their journey,

94
00:03:28,241 --> 00:03:30,610
as they get larger flocks and they,

95
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:32,710
they get more authority and they,

96
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:33,280
they get,

97
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:33,880
they get more,

98
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,530
they get life more abundant.

99
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:36,490
That's what happens.

100
00:03:36,491 --> 00:03:37,360
It's God isn't,

101
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:39,790
doesn't seem to be a miser
in the old testament.

102
00:03:39,791 --> 00:03:42,370
It's like if you put
in the effort and you,

103
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:45,250
and you accept the covenant
and you make the sacrifices,

104
00:03:45,251 --> 00:03:49,660
then you get to be successful and maybe
successful beyond your wildest dreams.

105
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:52,870
And that that's actually
seems to be okay with God.

106
00:03:52,871 --> 00:03:55,240
And that's pretty cool
given that you know,

107
00:03:55,241 --> 00:03:59,740
that that general notion of Old Testament
God is that all he's doing is casting

108
00:03:59,741 --> 00:04:01,360
out curses and death,

109
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:01,631
you know,

110
00:04:01,631 --> 00:04:03,100
wherever he happens to wander.

111
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,440
And I mean there's certainly
no shortage of that,

112
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:06,303
but,

113
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:07,510
but again,

114
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:10,390
it seems to be that that's very good
news and that you also don't have to be

115
00:04:10,391 --> 00:04:12,430
perfect in order for to have that happen.

116
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:14,350
And then the other thing,

117
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:16,690
this is the issue about
going into the unknown.

118
00:04:16,691 --> 00:04:17,524
It's like,

119
00:04:17,650 --> 00:04:17,831
well,

120
00:04:17,831 --> 00:04:22,390
if you leave your country and your kin
and your father's house and you go out

121
00:04:22,391 --> 00:04:25,180
into a land that your
intuition guides you to,

122
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:28,630
you're going to undergo these
radical transformations.

123
00:04:28,631 --> 00:04:30,870
This is a sacrificial
transformation too because you're,

124
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:34,450
you're moving forthrightly
and voluntarily into chaos,

125
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:35,081
right?

126
00:04:35,081 --> 00:04:36,640
And that's the same as the dragon fight.

127
00:04:36,641 --> 00:04:37,780
That's the hero of the story.

128
00:04:37,781 --> 00:04:41,560
And what will happen there is
that you will transform yourself.

129
00:04:41,561 --> 00:04:46,561
And so the call to an ideal is also
the call to a sequence of deaths and

130
00:04:46,961 --> 00:04:49,930
rebirths that move you closer
and closer to the ideal.

131
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:50,973
And that's what,

132
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,920
that's what God is calling Abraham to do.

133
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,270
In the first sentence of this story.
