1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:00,973
Hmm,

2
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:11,550
among the youngest as the approach
maturity go through a hysterical or

3
00:00:11,551 --> 00:00:14,200
history crisis,
but sometimes their vocation manifests

4
00:00:14,201 --> 00:00:17,130
itself at an earlier age.
The boy runs away into the mountains and

5
00:00:17,131 --> 00:00:19,560
remains there for a week or more feeding
on animals,

6
00:00:19,561 --> 00:00:21,330
which he terrorists to pieces with his
teeth.

7
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:25,330
He returns to the village filthy
bloodstained,

8
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:28,590
and it's only after 10 or more days that
have passed that he began to babble

9
00:00:28,591 --> 00:00:32,700
incoherent words.
The strange behavior of future showman's

10
00:00:32,701 --> 00:00:36,690
has not failed to attract the attention
of scholars and from the middle of the

11
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:37,980
past century,
several attempts have been made to

12
00:00:37,981 --> 00:00:40,170
explain the phenomena as a mental
disorder,

13
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,110
but the problem was wrongly put four.
On the one hand,

14
00:00:43,111 --> 00:00:47,430
it is not true that showman's always are
always have to be neuropathic,

15
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:50,910
mentally deranged.
On the other hand,

16
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:53,810
and this is the critical issue,
those among them who had been healed

17
00:00:53,811 --> 00:00:56,940
become shamans precisely because they
had succeeded in becoming cured.

18
00:00:57,540 --> 00:01:02,540
So it was not the descent into this
strange subterranean psychological state

19
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:07,050
that constitutes the transformation that
makes the showman,

20
00:01:07,051 --> 00:01:10,320
but it's the emergence back out of that
and that's a journey to the underworld

21
00:01:10,321 --> 00:01:11,850
and a and a rebirth.
Right?

22
00:01:11,851 --> 00:01:14,070
And so,
and there's this great book,

23
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:17,640
this is a great book by a guy named
Henri Ellenberger Shay,

24
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:21,240
and he was an existential,
a psychoanalyst and philosopher,

25
00:01:21,241 --> 00:01:23,820
and he wrote a book called the discovery
of the unconscious,

26
00:01:23,821 --> 00:01:26,550
which I would highly recommend it.
It's on my list of recommended readings.

27
00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:31,350
It is a great book if you want to know
about the psychoanalytic tradition,

28
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:34,500
uh,
it's the best introduction there is.

29
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:39,360
And he discusses Adler and young and
Freud and does a very credible job of

30
00:01:39,361 --> 00:01:43,740
all three but also takes the history of
psychoanalytic thought back three or 400

31
00:01:43,741 --> 00:01:47,070
years before Freud.
And so it's very engaging,

32
00:01:47,071 --> 00:01:48,510
reading and,
and,

33
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:50,130
and,
and very interesting.

34
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:54,210
And one of the things Ellenberg shape
points out quite clearly is,

35
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:56,400
and,
and he associates this to some degree

36
00:01:56,401 --> 00:01:58,710
with the shamanic tradition that both
Freud and young,

37
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:03,390
young in particular underwent very
intense periods of psychological

38
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:04,920
disturbance.
Let's say,

39
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:09,060
and I would say what was happening is
that because they were questioning their

40
00:02:09,061 --> 00:02:13,620
axioms at the most fundamental level,
they were deranging their cognitive and

41
00:02:13,621 --> 00:02:15,150
perceptual structures,
right,

42
00:02:15,151 --> 00:02:18,450
and young was also experimenting with
imaginative techniques,

43
00:02:18,451 --> 00:02:22,350
with visionary techniques which he,
which he did lot and there was a period

44
00:02:22,351 --> 00:02:25,140
of his life where he was having
constant,

45
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:28,560
a constant stream of visions which you
wrote down in a book called the red

46
00:02:28,561 --> 00:02:31,100
book,
but at the same time he was still

47
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:35,160
functioning as a psychiatrist and
operating normally in the world and so

48
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,880
people have suggested that what he had
was a psychotic break.

49
00:02:38,881 --> 00:02:40,650
But that's ridiculous because you don't
don't.

50
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:42,480
That's not how it works,
man.

51
00:02:42,481 --> 00:02:43,890
If you're having a psychotic break,
you,

52
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:45,990
you're not being an effective
psychiatrist.

53
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:48,930
Those things do not go together,
especially not for a long period of

54
00:02:48,931 --> 00:02:50,430
time.
And so there,

55
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:55,490
there's the possibility of extreme
experience without cyclocross

56
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:57,930
psychopathology.
And so,

57
00:02:58,490 --> 00:02:59,870
um,
and Elena Bursa,

58
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:02,230
he just,
he says much the same thing about Freud

59
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:05,770
and about Charles Darwin as well,
who underwent a terrible period of,

60
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:08,020
of,
of mental

61
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,990
confusion,
I would say,

62
00:03:10,991 --> 00:03:13,900
as a consequence of formulating his
theory of evolution,

63
00:03:13,901 --> 00:03:15,640
which was really hard on him because he
was a,

64
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,060
he was a die hard Christian and he knew
what he knew,

65
00:03:19,061 --> 00:03:21,280
what the implications of his theory
word.

66
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:22,960
He didn't know what to do about that,
you know,

67
00:03:22,961 --> 00:03:24,610
so it was very,
very hard on him.

68
00:03:24,611 --> 00:03:29,560
So it's quite common for people of
genius to go through an intense crisis,

69
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:32,980
psychological crisis,
but then resolve that.

70
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:35,050
And the genius is in the resolution,
right?

71
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:38,890
The precondition for the genius is the
dissolution in some sense because you

72
00:03:38,891 --> 00:03:42,460
have to be obsessed with a problem.
It has to grip you completely before

73
00:03:42,461 --> 00:03:45,340
you're going to concentrate on it.
So obsessively that you might come up

74
00:03:45,341 --> 00:03:47,710
with a solution.
But it's the people who come up with a

75
00:03:47,711 --> 00:03:52,550
solution that are the prophets in the
Sharmane and so forth and so on and,

76
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:54,340
and,
and so that's not.

77
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,180
This isn't something that only
characterizes our cultures.

78
00:03:57,190 --> 00:04:00,640
We just don't recognize it in our own
culture properly and,

79
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:03,130
and that's a problem.
Well,

80
00:04:03,131 --> 00:04:06,070
sometimes we do.
Right?

81
00:04:06,071 --> 00:04:07,090
You remember that in,
in,

82
00:04:07,091 --> 00:04:08,250
in the lion king,
right?

83
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:10,290
That Rafiki shows up.
He's the chairman.

84
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:10,890
He,
he,

85
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:15,460
he brings,
he brings up Simba down that tunnel dark

86
00:04:15,461 --> 00:04:17,170
tunnel.
That's the dark night of the soul.

87
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:19,690
He has them reflect upon himself and a
pool.

88
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:22,570
When he reflects upon himself,
deeply sees the reflection of his

89
00:04:22,571 --> 00:04:25,270
father,
then that becomes a thing of cosmic

90
00:04:25,271 --> 00:04:29,200
significance.
And his father appears in the sky just

91
00:04:29,201 --> 00:04:33,370
like God appears to Jacob and basically
tells them that it's time for him to

92
00:04:33,371 --> 00:04:38,320
grow the hell up and to return to the
devastated kingdom and to set it right.

93
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:41,350
You know,
and so and that's right.

94
00:04:41,351 --> 00:04:42,610
That's exactly right.
I mean,

95
00:04:42,611 --> 00:04:46,330
we live in the devastated kingdom.
That's an eternal truth and it's the

96
00:04:46,331 --> 00:04:51,331
responsibility of the individual to grow
the hell up and to set it right because

97
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:54,280
when it's devastated and when things are
not in place,

98
00:04:54,281 --> 00:04:57,820
then everyone suffers too much and
that's not good.

99
00:04:58,150 --> 00:05:00,670
And there's no excuse for not doing
something about it because you don't

100
00:05:00,671 --> 00:05:05,671
have anything better to do so.
And even like children's movies tell you

101
00:05:07,301 --> 00:05:07,780
this.
