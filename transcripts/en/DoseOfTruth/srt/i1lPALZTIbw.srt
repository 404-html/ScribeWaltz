1
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:07,360
Well,

2
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:08,660
what happens in the stock market?

3
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:09,613
Bubbles.

4
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:11,990
It's too much enthusiasm.

5
00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:14,330
People see an unspecified,

6
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:16,970
a reward of unspecified magnitude.

7
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:19,090
So it's like a magic treasure.

8
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:20,300
That's what happened with the Internet.

9
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:22,040
The Internet is a magic treasure.

10
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:23,203
True,

11
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:24,140
true.

12
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:25,130
Look at Google,

13
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:26,990
they got all the treasure.

14
00:00:27,350 --> 00:00:28,670
Everyone knew it was there,

15
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:30,163
thought they knew.

16
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:31,190
No one knew where it was.

17
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:33,200
So they're chasing it like Matt,

18
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:33,560
right?

19
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:35,400
Even an enthusiastic rash.

20
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:36,770
Was it stupid

21
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:39,260
for lots of people?

22
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:43,490
Wasn't stupid for the people
who happen to be in Google.

23
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:45,410
Okay,

24
00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:47,810
so enthusiasm can easily
get out of control.

25
00:00:47,811 --> 00:00:49,730
That's what happens when the
party gets out of control.

26
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:51,860
That's what happens.

27
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:53,660
Enthusiasm makes people impulsive.

28
00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:56,840
It makes them discount the
future because today is so great.

29
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,690
Enthusiasm turns into mania.

30
00:01:00,830 --> 00:01:01,341
And so you know,

31
00:01:01,341 --> 00:01:01,821
everybody says,

32
00:01:01,821 --> 00:01:01,941
well,

33
00:01:01,941 --> 00:01:02,721
you should be happy.

34
00:01:02,721 --> 00:01:04,700
You should be telling
positive effect all the time.

35
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:07,310
So no wrong pause.

36
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:08,840
Dab aspect is dangerous.

37
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:13,100
You're always telling your
kids to stop being so happy.

38
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:15,140
You don't notice it,

39
00:01:15,141 --> 00:01:16,520
but they're running
around causing trouble.

40
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:17,840
They're having a wild time.

41
00:01:17,841 --> 00:01:20,210
They're throwing their arms in the air
and they're laughing and they're running

42
00:01:20,211 --> 00:01:20,690
around,

43
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:21,710
they're having fun.

44
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:22,221
You say,

45
00:01:22,221 --> 00:01:23,054
Hey,

46
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:23,990
quiet down,

47
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:27,290
and if you count your
disciplinary actions,

48
00:01:27,291 --> 00:01:32,210
you'd be shocked at how often what you're
doing is telling your children to stop

49
00:01:32,211 --> 00:01:33,320
having so much fun.

50
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:34,870
Okay.
