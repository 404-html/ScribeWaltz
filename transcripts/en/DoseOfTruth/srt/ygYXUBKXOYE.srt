1
00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:06,941
Adam and eve,

2
00:00:06,941 --> 00:00:07,121
right?

3
00:00:07,121 --> 00:00:09,040
The mother and father of all humanity.

4
00:00:09,041 --> 00:00:12,850
So you could give them a nephrological
slat and you can say Adam is cultured.

5
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:16,360
Say and Eve is nature because
they're the archetipal parents.

6
00:00:16,361 --> 00:00:18,130
It's a perfectly
reasonable interpretation.

7
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:20,590
They have twin sons,

8
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:21,850
Cain and Abel.

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,480
So let's read first born creatures,

10
00:00:25,481 --> 00:00:29,140
first born human creatures in
the new self conscious world.

11
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:34,150
So what are the first two individuals
in the new self conscious world like?

12
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:35,590
And let's find out.

13
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:36,790
And Adam knew eve,

14
00:00:36,791 --> 00:00:37,624
his wife,

15
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:39,670
and she conceived and Bare Cain and said,

16
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:41,590
I have gotten a man from the Lord.

17
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:42,671
And again,

18
00:00:42,671 --> 00:00:44,110
she bare his brother Abel,

19
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,140
the younger brother and
Abel was a keeper of sheep.

20
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:49,000
But Cain was a tiller of the ground.

21
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:53,110
And in the process of time it came to
pass that Cain brought of the fruit of the

22
00:00:53,111 --> 00:00:53,381
ground,

23
00:00:53,381 --> 00:00:54,760
an offering unto the Lord.

24
00:00:54,970 --> 00:00:55,750
Okay,

25
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:57,760
so we're going to remove this from,

26
00:00:57,761 --> 00:00:58,594
it's

27
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:04,690
his story from its entrapment in a
particular temporal domain within a 10 or

28
00:01:04,691 --> 00:01:06,250
culture when to say something like this.

29
00:01:06,550 --> 00:01:07,210
Well,

30
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:08,230
if you work,

31
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:09,880
you make sacrifices,

32
00:01:09,881 --> 00:01:10,450
right?

33
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:11,530
That's what works all about.

34
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,700
And the reason you make sacrifices is
because you're offering up to the unknown,

35
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:19,750
the fruits of your labor in the hope
that as a consequence of your diligent

36
00:01:19,751 --> 00:01:20,410
effort,

37
00:01:20,410 --> 00:01:21,700
you're going to be favored,

38
00:01:21,701 --> 00:01:21,911
right?

39
00:01:21,911 --> 00:01:22,481
Because otherwise,

40
00:01:22,481 --> 00:01:23,020
why work?

41
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:27,220
The point of working is to transform the
transcendent into something benevolent.

42
00:01:27,370 --> 00:01:29,260
So you work and you work
and you work and you say,

43
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:30,790
is that sufficient?

44
00:01:30,791 --> 00:01:34,240
And the answer you get from
the transcendent is the answer.

45
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:35,291
Now,

46
00:01:35,291 --> 00:01:37,400
it's certainly true that
lots of people work.

47
00:01:37,401 --> 00:01:38,890
It doesn't go all that well,

48
00:01:38,891 --> 00:01:39,191
right?

49
00:01:39,191 --> 00:01:43,870
They make sacrifices and they do what
they think they have to do in their life

50
00:01:43,871 --> 00:01:46,210
is one string of
catastrophes after another,

51
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:46,570
right?

52
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:49,450
So we have this situation
in the process of time,

53
00:01:49,451 --> 00:01:51,940
it came to pass that Cain brought
of the fruit of the ground,

54
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:54,580
an offering unto the Lord and Abel.

55
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:58,690
He also brought of the firstlings
of his flock and of the fat thereof.

56
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:01,810
And the Lord had respect
unto Abel and his offering.

57
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:03,850
So what that means is that Oh,

58
00:02:03,851 --> 00:02:05,200
they able working away,

59
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:05,611
Bam,

60
00:02:05,611 --> 00:02:06,820
things are going great for him,

61
00:02:06,821 --> 00:02:07,091
right?

62
00:02:07,091 --> 00:02:08,290
Fortune smiles on him.

63
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:09,760
He's doing wonderfully.

64
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:12,340
He's got everything he needs.

65
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:12,731
Well,

66
00:02:12,731 --> 00:02:13,301
old cane,

67
00:02:13,301 --> 00:02:16,810
he's scrounging away in the ground and
things aren't going as well for him at

68
00:02:16,811 --> 00:02:17,021
all,

69
00:02:17,021 --> 00:02:17,321
right?

70
00:02:17,321 --> 00:02:18,460
Plagues locusts,

71
00:02:18,461 --> 00:02:19,294
you name it.

72
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:20,890
Farm life isn't going well.

73
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:21,820
So what happens?

74
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:24,611
Oh,

75
00:02:24,611 --> 00:02:29,320
Cain was very wroth and his
countenance fell precisely,

76
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:29,681
right?

77
00:02:29,681 --> 00:02:34,681
Because if you work diligently towards
a certain end and you don't get there,

78
00:02:35,021 --> 00:02:37,060
then you're continents fell.

79
00:02:37,061 --> 00:02:37,511
Falls,

80
00:02:37,511 --> 00:02:37,751
right?

81
00:02:37,751 --> 00:02:38,351
You're angry,

82
00:02:38,351 --> 00:02:38,951
frustrated,

83
00:02:38,951 --> 00:02:39,551
disappointed,

84
00:02:39,551 --> 00:02:39,881
hurt,

85
00:02:39,881 --> 00:02:40,451
anxious,

86
00:02:40,451 --> 00:02:41,050
threatened,

87
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:41,651
ashamed,

88
00:02:41,651 --> 00:02:42,430
guilty.

89
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:44,620
The whole panoply of negative emotions.

90
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:47,590
And that's fair enough
because of course if you fail,

91
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:49,300
that's sweats going to be the consequence.

92
00:02:49,301 --> 00:02:51,100
But then there's this little twist on it,

93
00:02:51,101 --> 00:02:51,311
right?

94
00:02:51,311 --> 00:02:53,450
This specifically human twist it.

95
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:56,140
It's like that kind of
moral of the whole story.

96
00:02:56,141 --> 00:02:59,110
And so you find the Lord saying,

97
00:02:59,140 --> 00:02:59,560
oh well,

98
00:02:59,560 --> 00:02:59,891
you know,

99
00:02:59,891 --> 00:03:00,371
what's,

100
00:03:00,371 --> 00:03:01,450
what's up with you?

101
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:03,250
Why are you so unhappy?

102
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:06,100
If you just got your act together,

103
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:10,300
then you'd be accepted if you
really got your act together,

104
00:03:10,301 --> 00:03:11,440
which is a statement,

105
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:12,520
something like this.

106
00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:17,850
If you keep making sacrifices and the
same terrible thing keeps happening,

107
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:22,810
there's always the possibility that you're
just actually not doing it the right

108
00:03:22,811 --> 00:03:23,500
way.

109
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,570
And if you just get
yourself straightened up,

110
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,500
tap together,

111
00:03:26,501 --> 00:03:26,831
right?

112
00:03:26,831 --> 00:03:31,060
And drop the preconceptions that you
don't really need and adjust your behavior

113
00:03:31,061 --> 00:03:31,601
accordingly.

114
00:03:31,601 --> 00:03:33,610
Then fortune would smile on you.

115
00:03:33,611 --> 00:03:36,100
And that's exactly what
the Lord says to Cain,

116
00:03:36,101 --> 00:03:36,934
right?

117
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:40,300
You don't walk around with such
a crabby look on your face.

118
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:41,171
If you did well,

119
00:03:41,171 --> 00:03:42,070
you'll be accepted.

120
00:03:42,071 --> 00:03:43,390
And if you don't do well,

121
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:45,250
sin lies at the door.

122
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,210
So what does that mean?

123
00:03:46,211 --> 00:03:46,391
Well,

124
00:03:46,391 --> 00:03:50,260
this is a deep motif in
ancient Hebrew thinking.

125
00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:55,450
If the world isn't laying itself out
in a manner that you find acceptable,

126
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,130
you're faced with a tough choice.

127
00:03:57,250 --> 00:04:01,090
Either the world is a terrible
place bent on your destruction,

128
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:06,330
or you're doing something wrong and it
bloody well better be that you're doing

129
00:04:06,341 --> 00:04:07,174
something wrong.

130
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:10,060
Because if the world is a terrible
place bent on your destruction,

131
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:12,520
you've got absolutely no hope.

132
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:17,690
And Kate and talk with Abel,

133
00:04:17,691 --> 00:04:18,470
his brother,

134
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:22,670
and it came to pass when they were in
the field that Cain rose up against Abel,

135
00:04:22,671 --> 00:04:23,450
his brother,

136
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:24,283
and killed him.

137
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,730
So what does that mean?

138
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:26,361
Well,

139
00:04:26,361 --> 00:04:27,194
it's pretty easy.

140
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:28,310
It's simple.

141
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:31,640
It means this will say things
aren't going that well for you.

142
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:36,530
And it's really not because life's unfair
and everything's stacked against you.

143
00:04:36,531 --> 00:04:38,690
It's because you're kind of a arrogant,

144
00:04:38,691 --> 00:04:39,441
stubborn,

145
00:04:39,441 --> 00:04:41,150
because I totalitarian,

146
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:42,830
cowardly idiot.

147
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,900
And as a consequence of that,

148
00:04:44,901 --> 00:04:48,380
the world is turning into something
resembling a wasteland around you and you

149
00:04:48,381 --> 00:04:50,240
have this option change.

150
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:53,050
Okay.

151
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:53,890
Or continue.

152
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:55,600
Or You have another option,

153
00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:56,823
man,

154
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:57,663
look around.

155
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:59,470
There's all those people doing well.

156
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:02,500
The world's a terrible place
bans on my destruction.

157
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:05,170
Wouldn't it be just the
most interesting thing?

158
00:05:05,171 --> 00:05:08,080
If as things are going to hell for me,

159
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,360
I could take along just for the ride.

160
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:15,420
Some of those successful people who
are successful just for unfair reasons

161
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:16,691
anyways,

162
00:05:16,691 --> 00:05:17,140
right?

163
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:21,490
So instead of using all that negative
emotion has a cue that there's something

164
00:05:21,491 --> 00:05:23,590
about me that might
need to be transformed.

165
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:24,341
I can say,

166
00:05:24,341 --> 00:05:25,174
well,

167
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:26,650
okay,

168
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:30,790
why not just eradicate the
target of my resentment,

169
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:31,390
right?

170
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:34,210
Not only because that sort of
removes the problem of comparison,

171
00:05:34,211 --> 00:05:36,040
but more profoundly.

172
00:05:36,041 --> 00:05:37,630
And I think sort of again,

173
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:39,820
eliminate honestly profoundly.

174
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:44,410
Let's say you make the decision that
the world's a terrible place and it's on

175
00:05:44,411 --> 00:05:45,244
your destruction,

176
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:46,061
and then you think,

177
00:05:46,061 --> 00:05:46,211
well,

178
00:05:46,211 --> 00:05:48,040
what's the logical response to that?

179
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:49,840
And then you think something like this.

180
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:57,083
Yeah.

181
00:05:58,760 --> 00:05:59,960
Girtha foes,

182
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:01,760
Mephistopheles Credo.

183
00:06:03,290 --> 00:06:07,790
This spirit I that endlessly
denies and rightly too,

184
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:13,270
for all that comes to birth is fit for
overthrow as nothing worth wherefore the

185
00:06:14,751 --> 00:06:15,380
world,

186
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:17,300
we're better sterilized.

187
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,790
Thus all that's here is evil.

188
00:06:19,791 --> 00:06:23,540
Recognized is gained to me and downfall,

189
00:06:23,541 --> 00:06:24,650
rune and sin,

190
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:26,870
the very element I prosper in

191
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:28,793
and

192
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:31,750
girth draws our attention to this credo.

193
00:06:31,751 --> 00:06:32,261
Not once,

194
00:06:32,261 --> 00:06:34,430
but twice in his writing a file.

195
00:06:34,431 --> 00:06:38,470
Austin has Mephistopheles
say right once again,

196
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,750
go on to share.

197
00:06:40,751 --> 00:06:43,930
Nothing passed with no made one.

198
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:45,041
What matters?

199
00:06:45,041 --> 00:06:45,761
Our creative,

200
00:06:45,761 --> 00:06:46,571
endless toil.

201
00:06:46,571 --> 00:06:47,650
When add a snapchat,

202
00:06:47,651 --> 00:06:48,940
oblivion ends the coil,

203
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:50,590
it is by gone.

204
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:55,150
I'll show this riddle run as good
as if things never had begun yet.

205
00:06:55,151 --> 00:06:57,280
Circle back existence to possess.

206
00:06:57,370 --> 00:06:59,500
I'd rather have eternal emptiness.

207
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:02,350
And so then you think about cane,

208
00:07:02,351 --> 00:07:05,740
like figures like Stella and you think,

209
00:07:05,741 --> 00:07:08,080
well what exactly was he motivated by?

210
00:07:08,081 --> 00:07:09,070
And on the one hand you think,

211
00:07:09,071 --> 00:07:09,460
well,

212
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:11,830
he was trying to extend
his cultural dominion,

213
00:07:11,831 --> 00:07:12,310
right?

214
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:15,100
Played by his own self
conscious neuroticism.

215
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:17,380
He wanted to extend the,

216
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:18,903
the,

217
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:24,540
the borders of his totalitarian certainty
to every corner just to not be plagued

218
00:07:26,231 --> 00:07:27,160
by the unknown.

219
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:27,941
And you think,

220
00:07:27,941 --> 00:07:28,541
fair enough.

221
00:07:28,541 --> 00:07:28,841
You know,

222
00:07:28,841 --> 00:07:31,810
like we're all pretty nervous and
a little stability is a good thing.

223
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:32,913
Why?

224
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:35,470
Because they make a fundamental judgment,

225
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:37,990
which is the judgment of Mephistopheles.

226
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:39,213
Look,

227
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:41,650
life is terrible,

228
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:42,693
terrible,

229
00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:45,370
terrible were self conscious.

230
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:46,570
We get sick,

231
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:47,620
we go insane.

232
00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:48,543
We're going to die.

233
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:49,450
Children,

234
00:07:49,450 --> 00:07:52,270
innocent children suffer everywhere.

235
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:57,540
How in the world is it right
to let such a state continue?

236
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:00,100
Maybe it would be better.

237
00:08:00,101 --> 00:08:04,390
All things considered just to
bring the whole game to an end.

238
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:09,870
And so then you think again with Haley
Adda that the reason that human societies

239
00:08:10,631 --> 00:08:12,130
fall apart is twofold.

240
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:16,270
One is things go from bad to
worse of their own accord,

241
00:08:16,271 --> 00:08:16,601
right?

242
00:08:16,601 --> 00:08:18,250
Thermodynamic reality,

243
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:19,540
pure entropy,

244
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:23,560
structured entities decay.

245
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:25,180
But then there's a twist.

246
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:31,020
Structured entities constructed by humans
are sped in their process of decay by

247
00:08:32,231 --> 00:08:35,470
the participants of the
individuals within that society.

248
00:08:35,770 --> 00:08:40,770
Who have essentially decided that the
game is not worth the price and that under

249
00:08:42,311 --> 00:08:43,480
such conditions,

250
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:47,020
the only reasonable thing
for a self conscious,

251
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:52,140
painfully self conscious individual
to do is to work as hard as he or she

252
00:08:52,301 --> 00:08:57,301
possibly can to take the maximum
amount of revenge on the conditions of

253
00:08:57,431 --> 00:09:01,780
existence and to ensure that
the entire game folds up,

254
00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:03,730
the consciousness disappears,

255
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:05,730
and the being is eradicated.
