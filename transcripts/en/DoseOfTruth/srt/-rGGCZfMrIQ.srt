1
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:09,420
First of all,
one person can wreak an awful lot of

2
00:00:09,421 --> 00:00:11,550
havoc.
There's absolutely no doubt about that.

3
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:13,650
And as we get more technologically
powerful,

4
00:00:13,651 --> 00:00:17,940
that becomes even more relevant and
important and crucial.

5
00:00:17,941 --> 00:00:19,890
You know,
one of the things that you said was that

6
00:00:19,891 --> 00:00:23,970
we had to wake up because we are too
technologically powerful to be as

7
00:00:23,971 --> 00:00:28,410
morally asleep as we are and that seems
to me just to be self evident.

8
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:29,010
That's.
Yeah,

9
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:29,970
for sure.
That's true.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,140
We're,
we're,

11
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:34,920
we're half asleep with nuclear bombs.
It's not a good idea.

12
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:36,570
It's seriously not a good idea.

13
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:38,303
And so.

14
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,420
Well,
and then you might ask yourself too,

15
00:00:43,421 --> 00:00:47,680
you know,
like what is the ultimate potential of a

16
00:00:47,681 --> 00:00:52,681
fully developed human being and well we
certainly know that you have admiration

17
00:00:53,411 --> 00:00:55,470
for people who are more developed rather
than less.

18
00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:58,910
That's,
that just happens automatic or

19
00:00:58,911 --> 00:01:00,680
resentment that.
But that's okay.

20
00:01:00,681 --> 00:01:02,210
It's the same thing.
It doesn't matter,

21
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:06,710
but it's not like you can identify that
you can identify them and they're put

22
00:01:06,711 --> 00:01:08,100
forward to you in,
in,

23
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:10,490
in drama and fiction and all of that
constantly.

24
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:13,100
So that's another form of moral
intuition.

25
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:13,993
You know,
you can read,

26
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,980
you can discern the wheat from the
chaff,

27
00:01:15,981 --> 00:01:17,330
let's say.
And,

28
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:22,370
and so
the other thing that I was thinking

29
00:01:26,591 --> 00:01:29,890
about it's worth consideration too,
is that,

30
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:32,650
you know,
and maybe this is,

31
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:35,290
maybe this is petty,
but I don't think it is.
