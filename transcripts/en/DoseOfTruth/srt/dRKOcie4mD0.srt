1
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:12,373
Yes.

2
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:15,163
Genuine,

3
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:19,810
genuinely giving her
perspective or just arguing?

4
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:23,480
Well,

5
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:24,320
that's a good question.

6
00:00:24,321 --> 00:00:24,921
Let's see if we can,

7
00:00:24,921 --> 00:00:26,360
let's see if we can formulate that.

8
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:27,913
So

9
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:30,440
the first difference might be,

10
00:00:30,441 --> 00:00:30,621
well,

11
00:00:30,621 --> 00:00:30,921
what's,

12
00:00:30,921 --> 00:00:32,510
what's the outcome we're looking for?

13
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:33,360
Like let's,

14
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:34,250
let's think about that.

15
00:00:34,251 --> 00:00:35,910
Let's think about that in the context of,

16
00:00:35,911 --> 00:00:36,410
uh,

17
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:37,610
of an intimate relationship,

18
00:00:37,611 --> 00:00:38,770
a familial relationships.

19
00:00:38,771 --> 00:00:39,680
So you have a wife,

20
00:00:39,681 --> 00:00:40,071
let's say,

21
00:00:40,071 --> 00:00:41,450
and you've got some kids just wonder,

22
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:41,971
what are you up,

23
00:00:41,971 --> 00:00:42,804
dude?

24
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:43,693
What do you want?

25
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:46,753
Hopefully.

26
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:47,971
Okay.

27
00:00:47,971 --> 00:00:48,950
So that's one thing we're,

28
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:52,950
so that we're trying to
establish the domain of the year.

29
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:53,400
We're going to,

30
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:54,720
we're going to try to make things better.

31
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:56,250
What would better look like?

32
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:57,713
You think

33
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:01,820
you could try a little bit my name,

34
00:01:01,821 --> 00:01:03,500
whatever negative emotion I can feel like.

35
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:04,461
Okay,

36
00:01:04,461 --> 00:01:04,721
so,

37
00:01:04,721 --> 00:01:05,720
so there's something,

38
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:06,021
okay.

39
00:01:06,021 --> 00:01:07,660
So that's a rough area of presupposition.

40
00:01:07,730 --> 00:01:10,280
Is that part of what you're doing
when you're making things better is to

41
00:01:10,281 --> 00:01:14,750
decrease the probability that negative
emotion will arise short term or long

42
00:01:14,751 --> 00:01:15,584
term?

43
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:18,401
Short term.

44
00:01:18,401 --> 00:01:19,234
First.

45
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:20,800
That's what bothering me.

46
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:21,620
Ah,

47
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:22,111
okay.

48
00:01:22,111 --> 00:01:26,340
So that's an interesting thing because
what if you have to experience a

49
00:01:26,341 --> 00:01:29,610
tremendous amount of short term pain
in order to make long term progress?

50
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:34,550
If it's different from the pain that
initially got me thinking about it seems

51
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:36,300
like an improvement potentially.

52
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:37,953
Okay.

53
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:39,543
Okay.

54
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:40,360
Okay.

55
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:41,193
Well

56
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:46,070
I'm going to address your question
completely from a ps Yeti and perspective,

57
00:01:46,071 --> 00:01:48,260
but that's okay because it
works for Rogers as well.

58
00:01:48,261 --> 00:01:49,730
It's just easier to explain

59
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,220
freedom from unnecessary suffering

60
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:57,951
in the short,

61
00:01:57,951 --> 00:01:58,341
medium,

62
00:01:58,341 --> 00:02:03,230
and long term across as many
people as you can imagine manage.

63
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:04,880
So we'll say,

64
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,170
let's start with you and your family.

65
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:07,131
Okay,

66
00:02:07,131 --> 00:02:08,240
how are you going to do that?

67
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:09,523
You don't know.

68
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,570
That's what you have to talk about.

69
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:13,823
Okay.

70
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:17,020
But you cannot have that conversation
until you've got that framework.

71
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:17,561
Right.

72
00:02:17,561 --> 00:02:18,940
So it's very,

73
00:02:18,941 --> 00:02:22,240
very tricky because in
the midst of the argument,

74
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:27,900
there's going to be tremendous temptation
to oppress and deceive and humiliate

75
00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:30,010
and,

76
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:34,870
and treat with contempt and hurt and
punish and threatened all of those things.

77
00:02:34,871 --> 00:02:35,440
Right?

78
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:39,940
And that that's partly reactivity
in the short term and then it's not,

79
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:44,950
that's not properly integrated into
the overarching hierarchical structure.

80
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:46,900
So you've got to keep bringing
yourself back to that.

81
00:02:46,901 --> 00:02:47,620
It's like,

82
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:49,690
why should you control your impulses?

83
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:51,003
Well,

84
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:54,040
because their manifestation
in the present,

85
00:02:54,041 --> 00:02:57,040
they're spontaneous and impulsive
manifestation in the present.

86
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:57,941
Well,

87
00:02:57,941 --> 00:02:58,840
although that may be,

88
00:03:02,210 --> 00:03:06,190
it may carry with it a
feeling of freedom and power,

89
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,990
maybe destroying the very structured
that's going to provide you with peace and

90
00:03:10,991 --> 00:03:13,120
stability over the medium and long run.

91
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:14,801
So it's again,

92
00:03:14,801 --> 00:03:16,150
it's the idea of contradiction.

93
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:17,703
Now,

94
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:19,360
if we're having a discussion,

95
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:19,780
okay,

96
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:20,613
so let's say,

97
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:21,340
well,

98
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:24,130
we'll do this in a very local fashion.

99
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:25,053
It's like,

100
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:29,813
okay,

101
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:34,630
well let's say you're having a discussion
about with your partner about who's

102
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:35,740
going to cook dinner.

103
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:37,203
Okay.

104
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:39,820
You think that's a simple discussion.

105
00:03:39,821 --> 00:03:41,450
It's like it's not a simple discussion.

106
00:03:41,451 --> 00:03:42,590
It's a horrible discussion.

107
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:46,880
It's where the war between
the genders manifests itself.

108
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,140
It's one of the places.

109
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:49,370
And to solve it,

110
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:50,840
did he not?

111
00:03:51,050 --> 00:03:53,900
You actually have to solve
the war between the genders.

112
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:54,261
Well,

113
00:03:54,261 --> 00:03:56,720
good luck with doc and there
it is right in your house.

114
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:57,230
Right?

115
00:03:57,230 --> 00:03:58,610
It's like a snake in the garden.

116
00:03:58,910 --> 00:03:59,900
There's no getting rid of it.

117
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:00,441
Okay.

118
00:04:00,441 --> 00:04:01,340
So then you might think,

119
00:04:01,341 --> 00:04:01,551
well,

120
00:04:01,551 --> 00:04:02,750
what's our aim for dinner?

121
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:04,700
Well,

122
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:05,780
do we want to have wretched,

123
00:04:05,781 --> 00:04:06,321
miserable,

124
00:04:06,321 --> 00:04:11,321
rotten foods served by a resentful
person to a bunch of ungrateful rats who

125
00:04:11,601 --> 00:04:13,250
complained and sniffle?

126
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,233
It's like,

127
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:14,990
no,

128
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:16,160
let's assume we don't want,

129
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:17,180
we don't want that.

130
00:04:17,210 --> 00:04:17,511
Okay,

131
00:04:17,511 --> 00:04:17,781
good.

132
00:04:17,781 --> 00:04:18,614
Well we've got,

133
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:20,450
you know what we're not aiming at.

134
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:20,950
So like,

135
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:21,783
all right,

136
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:22,633
um,

137
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:27,350
who should cook dinner and when and what
are the rules by which we decide that?

138
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:29,330
Huh?

139
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:31,790
That's a tough one because
you can return to roles,

140
00:04:31,791 --> 00:04:32,270
right?

141
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:32,780
That's what you,

142
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:34,100
that's why people have roles.

143
00:04:34,101 --> 00:04:36,290
So they don't have to have
stupid conversations like this,

144
00:04:36,291 --> 00:04:37,490
but that time is gone.

145
00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:38,121
Okay.

146
00:04:38,121 --> 00:04:40,460
So what do you do when there's no role?

147
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:41,451
Well,

148
00:04:41,451 --> 00:04:42,770
I could make you do it.

149
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,840
Maybe you know,

150
00:04:44,841 --> 00:04:45,141
by,

151
00:04:45,141 --> 00:04:48,530
I could either do it physically by force
or I could just intimidate you or I

152
00:04:48,531 --> 00:04:50,720
could make life miserable
for you if you don't do it.

153
00:04:50,721 --> 00:04:51,081
Or you know,

154
00:04:51,081 --> 00:04:52,000
there's lots of ways of,

155
00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:52,970
of,

156
00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:54,110
of using power.

157
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,500
Problem with that is you're not worthy.

158
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:58,940
You're not without your own book.

159
00:04:58,970 --> 00:04:59,803
What happens?

160
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:02,930
And for every step I take
towards making you miserable,

161
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,490
you'll get your chance.

162
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:09,320
So probably we don't want to use force
plus that's not so good for the kids.

163
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:09,940
You know,

164
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:12,080
from a role model perspective
and hypothetically,

165
00:05:12,081 --> 00:05:14,060
we want good things to
be happening to them.

166
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:16,640
So tyranny looks like it's out.

167
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:21,830
And I don't want you to subjugate yourself
because maybe like maybe you're very

168
00:05:21,831 --> 00:05:22,371
agreeable,

169
00:05:22,371 --> 00:05:25,820
let's say that because that's often a
problem in communication between men and

170
00:05:25,821 --> 00:05:26,300
women.

171
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:29,390
The guys more disagreeable
then the woman is.

172
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:33,200
And so if he like Jack
Suck the level of conflict,

173
00:05:33,201 --> 00:05:36,500
show back off because she doesn't like
conflict for all sorts of different

174
00:05:36,501 --> 00:05:37,280
reasons.

175
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,680
So that's another way of winning.

176
00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:43,910
Except then the person who loses his
all resentful and you end up with,

177
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:44,391
you know,

178
00:05:44,391 --> 00:05:44,841
horrible,

179
00:05:44,841 --> 00:05:49,841
miserable food fed two warring partners
who are complaining in and struggling.

180
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:52,790
It's not a good solution.

181
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:53,721
Right?

182
00:05:53,721 --> 00:05:55,280
So then what you're left with,

183
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:57,133
well then you've gotten,

184
00:05:58,700 --> 00:05:59,001
okay,

185
00:05:59,001 --> 00:05:59,900
so I might say,

186
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:00,321
well,

187
00:06:00,321 --> 00:06:02,450
do we agree that we need to have dinner?

188
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:03,621
Well,

189
00:06:03,621 --> 00:06:03,831
you know,

190
00:06:03,831 --> 00:06:04,371
when you might think,

191
00:06:04,371 --> 00:06:04,671
okay,

192
00:06:04,671 --> 00:06:05,870
well we could agree on that.

193
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:08,690
How often should we have it at home?

194
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:11,720
Well that's going to require
a fair bit of thought.

195
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:13,880
You want to go out now and then how often,

196
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:15,110
how much is that going to cost?

197
00:06:15,111 --> 00:06:15,901
What are we going to span?

198
00:06:15,901 --> 00:06:16,940
Where are we going to go?

199
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:17,930
Okay,

200
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:18,830
who pays?

201
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:19,791
Okay,

202
00:06:19,791 --> 00:06:21,860
so that's going to be
like a whole conversation.

203
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,300
So let's say we figured that out.

204
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:25,430
It's like five days a week
we're going to stay home.

205
00:06:25,431 --> 00:06:25,641
Okay,

206
00:06:25,641 --> 00:06:26,510
who's going to occur?

207
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:27,770
Well,

208
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:28,760
do you like cooking?

209
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:30,733
Do I like cooking?

210
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:31,820
Not something to sort out.

211
00:06:31,821 --> 00:06:32,654
So that would be,

212
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:34,940
that's like a little

213
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:39,170
discussion with your own
physiology in some sense.

214
00:06:39,171 --> 00:06:39,381
You know,

215
00:06:39,381 --> 00:06:42,260
what's your felt state while
you're preparing the food?

216
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:43,430
And maybe he'll say,

217
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:44,773
well,

218
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:46,670
I like it.

219
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:47,271
I'll cook the,

220
00:06:47,271 --> 00:06:47,540
if,

221
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:48,020
if,

222
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:51,020
if there's someone in the
kitchen with me and uh,

223
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:51,651
you know,

224
00:06:51,651 --> 00:06:53,720
someone else cleans up afterwards.

225
00:06:54,170 --> 00:06:55,003
Um,

226
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:57,710
then it turns out that I
don't mind cooking while,

227
00:06:57,910 --> 00:06:58,551
and then you might say,

228
00:06:58,551 --> 00:06:58,880
well,

229
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,790
is not minding good enough or
do you really want to enjoy it?

230
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:02,421
It's like,

231
00:07:02,421 --> 00:07:03,470
what's the preconditions?

232
00:07:03,471 --> 00:07:06,560
What preconditions would have
to be met for you to enjoy it.

233
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:08,450
While you want to think about that,

234
00:07:08,451 --> 00:07:09,950
because if you can get the person,

235
00:07:09,951 --> 00:07:10,611
either of you,

236
00:07:10,611 --> 00:07:12,860
who the hell cares to enjoy that,

237
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:14,300
then it's sort of self sustaining,

238
00:07:14,301 --> 00:07:14,511
right?

239
00:07:14,511 --> 00:07:18,230
You put that into place and then the
thing runs smoothly across multiple

240
00:07:18,231 --> 00:07:19,100
iterations.

241
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:20,420
And so then you might think,

242
00:07:20,421 --> 00:07:25,370
well what are the preconditions for us
to do that in a way that would be joyful

243
00:07:25,371 --> 00:07:25,880
that say,

244
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:26,270
okay,

245
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:27,051
well that's a high,

246
00:07:27,051 --> 00:07:27,950
that's a high bar.

247
00:07:27,951 --> 00:07:28,490
It's like,

248
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:29,323
well

249
00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:32,570
one or the other,

250
00:07:32,571 --> 00:07:35,360
but should learn to cook because
otherwise we're going to eat and like,

251
00:07:35,570 --> 00:07:35,870
you know,

252
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:40,490
canned spaghetti or some other sort of
horror and that's not very high quality.

253
00:07:40,491 --> 00:07:42,140
So that problem might have to be solved.

254
00:07:42,141 --> 00:07:45,170
And then there's the problem of how
you react to the person when they cook.

255
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:45,770
You know,

256
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:48,950
like do you just assume that that's
their bloody responsibility and if they

257
00:07:48,951 --> 00:07:49,761
don't live up to it,

258
00:07:49,761 --> 00:07:50,720
there's something wrong with them?

259
00:07:50,721 --> 00:07:55,520
Or do you notice what they're doing and
express some appreciation and gratitude

260
00:07:55,521 --> 00:07:59,420
and and in a way that would increase
the probability that would happen again,

261
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:00,590
that'd be a better solution.

262
00:08:00,591 --> 00:08:03,800
So then you have to negotiate
about how you're going to do that.

263
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:04,730
Exactly.

264
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:07,310
Maybe even right down
to the level of words,

265
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:09,480
but what you're sir,

266
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:10,191
see what you're,

267
00:08:10,191 --> 00:08:12,620
you're trying to serve a
higher order by doing that,

268
00:08:12,621 --> 00:08:13,160
right?

269
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,000
You're trying to,

270
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:18,140
you're trying to satisfy
basic organismal needs,

271
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:20,210
the provision of food.

272
00:08:20,211 --> 00:08:20,571
But I mean,

273
00:08:20,571 --> 00:08:22,910
food is complicated for human
beings because we just don't,

274
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:26,300
you just don't put dog food
in the bowl and chow down.

275
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,670
Even dogs won't do that.

276
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,790
Our dog won't eat less.

277
00:08:28,791 --> 00:08:29,624
We're eating,

278
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:30,231
you know,

279
00:08:30,231 --> 00:08:33,590
so human beings are
extremely social leaders,

280
00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:36,620
so you have to get that right and so,

281
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:41,630
but the conversation will only take
place in the proper manner if your

282
00:08:41,631 --> 00:08:44,300
orientation is proper in the,

283
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:45,980
during the conversation.

284
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:47,540
And the orientation needs to be,

285
00:08:48,530 --> 00:08:52,160
how can we make this better for both of
us in the long run and for the people

286
00:08:52,161 --> 00:08:54,920
around us and that you have
to bow down before that.

287
00:08:54,921 --> 00:08:56,940
In some sense as the highest,

288
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:00,090
highest order principle
that you're serving.

289
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:03,000
And then you can stumble
around trying to work that out.

290
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:03,811
And then you might say,

291
00:09:03,811 --> 00:09:08,400
well you cook three times a week and I
cooked twice and I'll take care of it

292
00:09:08,401 --> 00:09:09,234
once.

293
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:13,020
And then of course you have to get the
whole grocery thing settled out and

294
00:09:13,021 --> 00:09:15,570
that's a whole other bloody
complicated conversation,

295
00:09:15,571 --> 00:09:16,800
but it needs to be done.

296
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:18,061
And then you might say,

297
00:09:18,061 --> 00:09:18,181
well,

298
00:09:18,181 --> 00:09:22,320
let's run this for a couple of weeks and
we'll see how it goes and then we can

299
00:09:22,321 --> 00:09:24,720
meet again and we can discuss
what worked and what didn't.

300
00:09:24,721 --> 00:09:27,540
And the goal is to make it better,

301
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:29,520
make it better and make it
better and make it better.

302
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:32,220
And then no one's trying to win.

303
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:33,301
Well,

304
00:09:33,301 --> 00:09:36,180
it depends on what you mean by
when I'm not trying to defeat you,

305
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:38,100
why we'll have to live with you.

306
00:09:38,101 --> 00:09:39,180
That'd be the first reasons.

307
00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:39,391
Like,

308
00:09:39,391 --> 00:09:40,740
what the hell good is it defeating you?

309
00:09:40,741 --> 00:09:42,810
Unless I want someone
100 around like this,

310
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:43,231
you know,

311
00:09:43,231 --> 00:09:44,460
resentful and bitter.

312
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:45,750
Maybe I do want that,

313
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:49,470
but I don't think that's a
very good place to start.

314
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:52,170
So when you have a client
come in to see you,

315
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:53,970
the rule is,

316
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:57,330
I can tell you the rules I
used cause they're Rogerian.

317
00:09:58,110 --> 00:09:58,943
Um,

318
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:01,140
I will tell the person what I think.

319
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:05,610
So I won't tell them that
what I think is right.

320
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,740
But if they're doing something and I,

321
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:12,750
I have a reaction to that of some sort
that'll usually express itself in a

322
00:10:12,751 --> 00:10:13,770
fantasy or a thought.

323
00:10:13,771 --> 00:10:15,360
And I'll just tell them what happened.

324
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:16,471
And you know,

325
00:10:16,471 --> 00:10:21,360
I tried to do it as gently as I possibly
can because you can use the truth as a

326
00:10:21,361 --> 00:10:22,050
club,

327
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:23,490
but then that's not the truth.

328
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:28,380
And then at least they get the honest
response of one person to what they're

329
00:10:28,381 --> 00:10:29,214
like.

330
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:30,180
And I'll tell you,

331
00:10:30,181 --> 00:10:33,810
I've seen lots of people who've never
got the honest response of any one person

332
00:10:33,811 --> 00:10:35,730
ever in their whole
life to what their life.

333
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:39,150
And so they have no idea what they're
like or what's annoying other people or

334
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:41,430
how they should behave
or any of those things.

335
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:42,061
So,

336
00:10:42,061 --> 00:10:43,570
even though I'm not going to be right,

337
00:10:43,571 --> 00:10:44,404
and you know,

338
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:49,760
in that my reactions won't be a precisely
accurate representation of the average

339
00:10:50,401 --> 00:10:51,930
response of other people,

340
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:54,030
which is basically what
you're trying to model.

341
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,580
It's going to be a lot better
than they've had so far.

342
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:00,390
And then now than precondition is
you're going to try really hard to get

343
00:11:00,391 --> 00:11:01,320
yourself together,

344
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:02,250
whatever that means.

345
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:05,490
We're going to talk about whatever that
means and I'm going to support you in

346
00:11:05,491 --> 00:11:06,324
that.

347
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:07,680
And that's our goal.

348
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:12,840
And that that's a variant of Rogerian
unconditional positive regard.

349
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,100
And his,

350
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:16,560
his unconditional positive
regard in some sense was,

351
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:18,840
was the setup for the therapy.

352
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:21,600
So the presupposition is your valuable,

353
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:24,810
although maybe you're a little
on the bent and twisted side,

354
00:11:24,811 --> 00:11:25,540
but you know,

355
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:28,920
maybe you could be straightened up
into something that's like deadly.

356
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:30,090
And uh,

357
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:33,300
we're going to start with
that presupposition and
we're going to learn on the

358
00:11:33,301 --> 00:11:34,020
way.

359
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:34,680
But that's what,

360
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:35,513
that's what we're,

361
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:36,690
that's what we're doing that,

362
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:40,110
so the unconditional positive regard,

363
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:44,610
it's like a human rights thinking because
the basis of the idea of human rights

364
00:11:44,611 --> 00:11:45,810
is that people are valuable.

365
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:47,850
They have some intrinsic value,

366
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:48,901
you know,

367
00:11:48,901 --> 00:11:49,470
and the,

368
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:50,010
the,

369
00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:52,770
I think maybe it's PR,

370
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:56,230
it's reasonable to presuppose that from
the Reef Raj area perspective is that

371
00:11:56,231 --> 00:11:59,290
what's valuable about you
as you're being right?

372
00:11:59,291 --> 00:12:00,190
You're a conscious,

373
00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:02,500
you're a locus of experience.

374
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:03,880
And as such,

375
00:12:03,881 --> 00:12:05,770
here are unique locus of experience.

376
00:12:05,771 --> 00:12:06,431
And as such,

377
00:12:06,431 --> 00:12:06,910
you,

378
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:09,820
you have something to contribute
that no one else can contribute.

379
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:11,620
And that that's valuable.

380
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,360
It's intrinsically valuable.

381
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:16,180
That's the basic presupposition
of the idea of human rights,

382
00:12:16,181 --> 00:12:17,014
by the way.

383
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:20,020
So if that's acted out in
the therapeutic session,

384
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:22,120
but it's acted out in any relationship,

385
00:12:22,121 --> 00:12:22,900
that's therapeutic.
