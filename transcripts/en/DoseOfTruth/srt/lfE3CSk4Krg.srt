1
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:12,751
Okay.

2
00:00:12,751 --> 00:00:13,584
So

3
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:19,760
now we're going to talk about the
phenomenal logical existential slash

4
00:00:19,891 --> 00:00:24,891
phenomenological psych guy trusts
and their theories from the 1950s.

5
00:00:25,471 --> 00:00:26,940
And as I mentioned to you before,

6
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:31,800
a lot of their thinking was motivated
by what had happened in World War II.

7
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:32,421
When I,

8
00:00:32,421 --> 00:00:33,750
when I lecture to you last,

9
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:34,330
I,

10
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:35,163
I pointed out,

11
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:41,070
I described Nietzschean Dostoyevsky's
summation of the world situation and

12
00:00:41,071 --> 00:00:43,950
really the world psychological
situation at the end of the 18 hundreds.

13
00:00:43,951 --> 00:00:44,784
And that was that

14
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:49,800
our new modes of thinking had undermined
our faith and our old modes of

15
00:00:49,801 --> 00:00:50,251
thinking.

16
00:00:50,251 --> 00:00:53,400
And that was a problem because people
need something firm to stand on,

17
00:00:53,401 --> 00:00:55,350
to orient themselves and to move forward.

18
00:00:55,590 --> 00:01:00,120
And so Nietzschean Dostoyevsky basically
both prophesied that the consequence of

19
00:01:00,121 --> 00:01:01,500
that dissolution would be,

20
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:02,580
um,

21
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:06,120
increased probability of nihilism and
everything that went along with that.

22
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:09,810
And Dostoevsky wrote about that actually
quite extensively in a book called

23
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:11,070
notes from underground,

24
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:12,510
which if any of you are interested,

25
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:14,250
especially in clinical psychology,

26
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:17,550
that's a book you should really read
because it's one of the most brilliant

27
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:19,380
psychological studies of,

28
00:01:19,381 --> 00:01:19,640
uh,

29
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:19,831
of,

30
00:01:19,831 --> 00:01:20,190
uh,

31
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:20,401
of,

32
00:01:20,401 --> 00:01:21,030
uh,

33
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:24,600
psychologically disturbed
man that's ever been written.

34
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:25,500
It's very accurate.

35
00:01:25,501 --> 00:01:27,990
And there are sections in crime and
punishment that are like that too.

36
00:01:27,991 --> 00:01:31,410
I think there are unsurpassed
in their representation of,

37
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:32,723
of psych,

38
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:34,360
of psychological phenomena.

39
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:36,413
I don't,

40
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:37,950
I don't know how he managed it.

41
00:01:37,951 --> 00:01:38,221
I mean,

42
00:01:38,221 --> 00:01:40,020
Dostoyevsky was epileptic,

43
00:01:40,021 --> 00:01:41,190
I don't know if you know that,

44
00:01:41,191 --> 00:01:42,210
but he,

45
00:01:42,211 --> 00:01:43,044
um,

46
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:47,550
he was arrested by the czar's men in
the late 18 hundreds for being a student

47
00:01:47,551 --> 00:01:52,551
radical and they throw them
in the main prison in Moscow.

48
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:57,480
And then one day they took them out in
front of a firing squad and shot him at

49
00:01:57,481 --> 00:01:58,314
six in the morning,

50
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,610
but they only use blanks,

51
00:01:59,611 --> 00:02:00,960
which of course he didn't know about.

52
00:02:00,961 --> 00:02:03,270
And that scared him so badly.

53
00:02:03,271 --> 00:02:05,130
He developed epilepsy
and then he had epilepsy.

54
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,270
That can happen by the way.

55
00:02:06,610 --> 00:02:07,443
Um,

56
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,900
if Andy had epilepsy for
the rest of his life,

57
00:02:09,901 --> 00:02:11,550
but he had this strange kind of epilepsy,

58
00:02:11,551 --> 00:02:13,650
which is actually not all that rare.

59
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:14,191
Um,

60
00:02:14,191 --> 00:02:15,780
sometimes when people have epilepsy,

61
00:02:15,781 --> 00:02:17,550
they experienced this phenomena.

62
00:02:17,551 --> 00:02:18,480
They call an aura,

63
00:02:18,481 --> 00:02:21,810
which is an altered state of consciousness
before the epileptic seizure hits.

64
00:02:21,811 --> 00:02:23,330
And they can be very strange these auras.

65
00:02:23,331 --> 00:02:26,010
So I read a case study
once about a guy who,

66
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:27,203
um,

67
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:31,350
his aura was that his hand was
being possessed by devils from hell,

68
00:02:31,351 --> 00:02:35,040
and he could feel the possession move
up his arm and into his shoulder.

69
00:02:35,041 --> 00:02:35,880
And once it hit his head,

70
00:02:35,881 --> 00:02:37,170
he'd have an epileptic seizure.

71
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:39,750
And so then there was another case,

72
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:41,173
um,

73
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:41,970
where,

74
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:42,810
where this man,

75
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:46,380
his aura was that his exact
double had appeared behind him.

76
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:48,031
But if you turn it,

77
00:02:48,031 --> 00:02:48,900
and if you turn to look,

78
00:02:48,901 --> 00:02:50,220
then he'd have an epileptic seizure.

79
00:02:50,221 --> 00:02:52,290
But if he didn't turn to
look that he wouldn't.

80
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:56,850
So these brain disorders are very
strange things because they're,

81
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:57,840
well,

82
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,810
the system that is disordered is alive
and it's capable of any number of

83
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:04,000
extraordinarily peculiar misbehaviors.

84
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:04,421
Anyways,

85
00:03:04,421 --> 00:03:09,150
Dostoyevsky's aura was
a world revealing aura.

86
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:13,330
And so what Dostoyevsky would experience
was that the meaning of things got

87
00:03:13,331 --> 00:03:15,670
deeper and deeper and deeper
and deeper and deeper.

88
00:03:15,671 --> 00:03:19,570
And then just as he was on the verge of
discovering the secret to everything,

89
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:21,100
he'd have an epileptic seizure.

90
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:26,200
But he said that the quality of
experience during the aura was so high,

91
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:30,550
so overpowering and so deep that he
would have traded all of his normal

92
00:03:30,551 --> 00:03:34,030
experience just to have had those
experiences and have them repeatedly.

93
00:03:34,031 --> 00:03:38,620
And I really do believe that
it was this broadening of his,

94
00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:42,580
of his vision and concept by his
epilepsy that transformed them.

95
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:43,540
Among other things.

96
00:03:43,541 --> 00:03:43,781
I mean,

97
00:03:43,781 --> 00:03:47,050
he went through some pretty damn rough
experiences because he was in prison with

98
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:50,170
rapists and murderers for
a long time in Siberia,

99
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:52,580
even though he was kind
of an aristocratic guy.

100
00:03:52,581 --> 00:03:52,781
I mean,

101
00:03:52,781 --> 00:03:53,410
he had a,

102
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:54,760
he had a rough time of it.

103
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:55,431
And I,

104
00:03:55,431 --> 00:04:00,160
I imagine that that also broadened him
tremendously given that it didn't kill

105
00:04:00,161 --> 00:04:00,910
him.

106
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:01,300
But,

107
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:01,750
um,

108
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:05,950
I really do believe that the
epileptic insight was key to his,

109
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:08,230
like his unsurpassed genius.

110
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:09,543
And so,

111
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:14,560
and the his aura and other people do
experience epileptic or a symptoms like

112
00:04:14,561 --> 00:04:14,741
that,

113
00:04:14,741 --> 00:04:15,131
by the way.

114
00:04:15,131 --> 00:04:18,840
And some people are so enamored of the
aura that they won't take their auntie

115
00:04:18,841 --> 00:04:22,450
epilepsy medication because they don't
want to forego the experience that

116
00:04:22,451 --> 00:04:26,650
precedes the aura or the actual
actual epileptic seizure.

117
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:30,130
So Dostoyevsky's experiences,

118
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:30,661
they,

119
00:04:30,661 --> 00:04:35,230
the op element of the aura is also
relevant to what we're going to talk about

120
00:04:35,231 --> 00:04:38,560
today because both been swagger and boss.

121
00:04:38,561 --> 00:04:42,190
We're very interested in how meaning
revealed itself in the world.

122
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:43,150
And they had an,

123
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:45,130
they had opposing explanations.

124
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:48,370
I actually think they're
parallel explanations,

125
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:52,630
but the meaning that
Dostoyevsky experienced is,

126
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:57,130
is an amplification of the normal manner
in which meaning reveals itself in the

127
00:04:57,131 --> 00:04:57,964
world.

128
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,980
So I mean,

129
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:04,390
and people experience that sort of
thing in various altered states of

130
00:05:04,391 --> 00:05:05,080
consciousness.
