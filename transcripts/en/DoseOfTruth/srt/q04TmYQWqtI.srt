1
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:10,800
There's this idea in union psychology
called the circumambulation and you only

2
00:00:10,801 --> 00:00:15,801
had this idea that you had a potential
future self which would be in potential

3
00:00:16,681 --> 00:00:21,600
everything that you could be and that
it manifests itself moment to moment in

4
00:00:21,601 --> 00:00:26,601
your present life by making you interested
in things and the things that you're

5
00:00:26,641 --> 00:00:30,240
interested in are the things that would
guide you along the path that would lead

6
00:00:30,241 --> 00:00:31,590
you to maximal development.

7
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:37,160
Now it sounds like a metaphysical
idea or a or a mystical idea even,

8
00:00:37,741 --> 00:00:38,574
but,

9
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:39,450
but it's not.

10
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:39,731
It's,

11
00:00:39,731 --> 00:00:40,291
it's not.

12
00:00:40,291 --> 00:00:42,450
It's a really profoundly biological idea.

13
00:00:42,451 --> 00:00:43,530
The idea is something like,

14
00:00:43,531 --> 00:00:44,364
well,

15
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:47,890
you're set up so that you're automatically
interested in those things that was

16
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:53,570
fully expand you as a well
adapted creature while like
there's nothing radical

17
00:00:54,001 --> 00:00:54,840
about that idea.

18
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:55,710
How else,

19
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:59,760
what else could possibly be the case
unless there's something fundamentally

20
00:00:59,761 --> 00:01:00,990
flawed about you.

21
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:03,450
That is what the situation would be.

22
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:06,930
It's kind of interesting to think about
how that would be manifest moment to

23
00:01:06,931 --> 00:01:07,441
moment,

24
00:01:07,441 --> 00:01:08,670
but the idea is something like,

25
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:09,430
well,

26
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:13,210
your interest is captured by those
things that lead you down the path of

27
00:01:13,211 --> 00:01:14,044
development.

28
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:15,730
Well that better be the case.

29
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:16,301
Okay.

30
00:01:16,301 --> 00:01:17,134
So that's fine.

31
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:20,920
And so there's some utility in pursuing
those things that you're interested in.

32
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,270
That's the call to adventure,

33
00:01:22,271 --> 00:01:23,104
let's say.

34
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:24,520
So.

35
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:26,650
And the call to adventure
takes you all sorts of places.

36
00:01:26,651 --> 00:01:28,810
Now the problem with the
call to adventure is like,

37
00:01:28,811 --> 00:01:29,860
what the hell do you know?

38
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:33,630
You might be interested in things
that are kind of warped and bent.

39
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:39,500
And often it's the case that when new
parts of people manifest themselves and

40
00:01:39,721 --> 00:01:40,800
gripped their interest,

41
00:01:40,801 --> 00:01:43,500
say they do it very badly in shoddily.

42
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:47,550
And so you stumble around like an
idiot when you try to do something new.

43
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:50,400
That's where the fool is the
precursor to the savior from the,

44
00:01:50,730 --> 00:01:52,590
from the symbolic perspectives.

45
00:01:52,591 --> 00:01:55,050
Cause you have to be a fool
before you can be a master.

46
00:01:55,051 --> 00:01:57,480
And if you're not willing to be
a fool and you can't be a master,

47
00:01:57,481 --> 00:01:58,314
so,

48
00:01:59,230 --> 00:01:59,970
so you're going to,

49
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:00,260
it's,

50
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:01,480
it's an error,

51
00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:03,490
error ridden process.

52
00:02:03,491 --> 00:02:06,430
And that's also laid out in the old
testament stories because the first thing

53
00:02:06,431 --> 00:02:10,510
that happens to all these patriarchal
figures when God kicks them out of their

54
00:02:10,511 --> 00:02:14,080
father's house when they're
like 84 is that they,

55
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:16,150
they run into all sorts of trouble.

56
00:02:16,151 --> 00:02:19,300
And some of it's social and some of it's
natural and some of it's a consequence

57
00:02:19,301 --> 00:02:20,830
of their own moral inadequacy.

58
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:23,040
So they're fools and,

59
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:23,500
but,

60
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:27,310
but the thing that's so interesting is
that despite the fact that they're fools,

61
00:02:27,311 --> 00:02:31,030
they're still supposed to go on the
adventure and that they're capable of

62
00:02:31,031 --> 00:02:35,140
learning enough as a consequence of moving
forward on the adventure so that they

63
00:02:35,141 --> 00:02:36,970
straightened themselves out across time.

64
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,070
And so it's something like this,

65
00:02:39,071 --> 00:02:43,270
and this circumambulation that young
talked about was this continual,

66
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:44,410
we'll return to this,

67
00:02:44,411 --> 00:02:48,220
this continual circling in
some sense of who you could be.

68
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:49,121
You might notice,

69
00:02:49,121 --> 00:02:49,721
for example,

70
00:02:49,721 --> 00:02:51,250
that there are themes in your life.

71
00:02:51,251 --> 00:02:51,461
You know,

72
00:02:51,461 --> 00:02:53,950
when you go back across your experiences,

73
00:02:53,951 --> 00:02:54,221
you see,

74
00:02:54,221 --> 00:02:57,400
you kind of have your typical
experience that sort of repeats itself.

75
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:00,910
And there might be on
it like a musical theme,

76
00:03:00,911 --> 00:03:01,530
but it's,

77
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:02,680
it's like you're,

78
00:03:02,681 --> 00:03:07,120
you're circling yourself and
getting closer to yourself
as you move across time.

79
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:10,510
That's the circumambulation now you
remember that for a second cause we'll go

80
00:03:10,511 --> 00:03:11,344
back to it.

81
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:11,591
Okay.

82
00:03:11,591 --> 00:03:14,230
So imagine that something
glimmers before you,

83
00:03:14,231 --> 00:03:17,410
it's an interest that's
daunting and you decide,

84
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:17,801
well,

85
00:03:17,801 --> 00:03:18,311
first of all,

86
00:03:18,311 --> 00:03:19,091
you're paralyzed.

87
00:03:19,091 --> 00:03:19,421
You think,

88
00:03:19,421 --> 00:03:21,010
well how do I know if
I should pursue that?

89
00:03:21,011 --> 00:03:22,540
It's probably a stupid idea.

90
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:24,820
And the proper response to that is,

91
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:25,421
you're right,

92
00:03:25,421 --> 00:03:27,840
it probably is a stupid
idea because almost all,

93
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:29,440
all ideas are stupid.

94
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:34,510
And so the probability that as you move
forward on your adventure that you're

95
00:03:34,511 --> 00:03:37,210
going to get it right
the first time is zero.

96
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:38,920
It's just not going to happen.

97
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:40,480
And so then you might think,

98
00:03:40,481 --> 00:03:43,870
well maybe I'll just wait around
until I get the right idea.

99
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:45,370
And which people do,

100
00:03:45,371 --> 00:03:45,611
right?

101
00:03:45,611 --> 00:03:47,020
So they're like 40 year old,

102
00:03:47,021 --> 00:03:47,890
13 year olds,

103
00:03:47,891 --> 00:03:49,330
which is not a good idea.

104
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:54,250
So they wait around until it's waiting
for Godot until they finally got it

105
00:03:54,251 --> 00:03:54,551
right.

106
00:03:54,551 --> 00:03:57,190
But the problem is you're too stupid
to know when you've got it right.

107
00:03:57,191 --> 00:04:01,450
So waiting around isn't going to
help because even if it's the perfect

108
00:04:01,451 --> 00:04:05,350
opportunity manifested itself
to you in your incomplete form,

109
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:09,610
the probability that you would recognize
it as the perfect opportunity is zero.

110
00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:13,120
You might even think it's the worst
possible idea that you've ever heard of

111
00:04:13,121 --> 00:04:13,930
anywhere.

112
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:14,920
Highly likely,

113
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:16,060
highly likely.

114
00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:17,170
So,

115
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:19,930
so you ha there's niche
nichier called that.

116
00:04:19,931 --> 00:04:20,080
Uh,

117
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:20,351
we'll,

118
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:21,520
we'll to stupidity,

119
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:22,840
which I really liked.

120
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:25,610
So because he thought of
stupidity as being it,

121
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:26,771
you know,

122
00:04:26,771 --> 00:04:26,980
it's,

123
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:27,730
it's,

124
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:31,210
you have to take it into account
fundamentally and work with it.

125
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:32,223
And so,

126
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:37,470
and so you can take these tentative steps
on your pathway to destiny and you can

127
00:04:38,351 --> 00:04:40,060
assume that you're going to do it badly.

128
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:43,300
And that's really useful because
you don't have to beat yourself up.

129
00:04:43,301 --> 00:04:44,830
It's pretty easy to do it badly.

130
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:46,121
But the thing is,

131
00:04:46,121 --> 00:04:48,730
it's way better to do it badly
than not to do it at all.

132
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:53,790
And that's the continual message that
echoes through these historical stories in

133
00:04:53,951 --> 00:04:54,491
genesis.

134
00:04:54,491 --> 00:04:56,710
It's like these are flawed people.

135
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,860
They should've got the hell out of
their house way before they did.

136
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:00,973
Um,

137
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:06,010
and they go out and they stumble around
in tyranny and famine and self betrayal

138
00:05:06,011 --> 00:05:06,610
and,

139
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:08,710
and violence.

140
00:05:08,711 --> 00:05:09,190
And,

141
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:12,100
but it's a hell of a lot better
than just rotting away at home.
