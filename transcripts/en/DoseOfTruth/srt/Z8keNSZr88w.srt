1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:00,381
Okay.

2
00:00:00,381 --> 00:00:01,131
So that's a good,

3
00:00:01,131 --> 00:00:02,450
that's a good place to go next.

4
00:00:02,451 --> 00:00:06,080
So you laid out a whole slew of reasons,

5
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:10,730
a slew of consequences of fatherlessness
and we'll return back to the causal

6
00:00:10,731 --> 00:00:14,210
relationship between men do
and these beneficial outcomes.

7
00:00:14,211 --> 00:00:19,211
But if you could go on now to tell us
what it is that men are doing at a micro

8
00:00:19,521 --> 00:00:19,821
level,

9
00:00:19,821 --> 00:00:23,420
then we could return to the causal link
between that and the positive outcomes.

10
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:27,380
And you said those also caused
some contention in the household?

11
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:28,501
Yes.

12
00:00:28,501 --> 00:00:28,790
You know,

13
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:29,750
give one example,

14
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:30,593
for example,

15
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:31,513
will it be

16
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:37,200
father is rough housing with the kids
and the moms looking over and saying,

17
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:39,240
looking at scans and thinking,

18
00:00:39,241 --> 00:00:39,571
okay,

19
00:00:39,571 --> 00:00:40,560
when should I interfere?

20
00:00:40,561 --> 00:00:41,490
When should I not interfere?

21
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,200
And the mom saying herself,

22
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:45,683
Jimmy,

23
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:46,550
you know,

24
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:47,340
um,

25
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:49,010
please keep the kids away from the,

26
00:00:49,011 --> 00:00:49,920
the credenza there,

27
00:00:49,921 --> 00:00:50,161
Pete,

28
00:00:50,161 --> 00:00:52,900
that gets away from the couch because
they could hit their head there.

29
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:54,900
Why did she wait?

30
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,350
They to tomorrow when you
can take this outside.

31
00:00:58,351 --> 00:00:59,750
I feel much safer with the kids shit.

32
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:04,650
And then the mother is sort of
hesitating to not be overly controlling.

33
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:07,650
And yet at the same time she's
feeling she has to monitor.

34
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:08,400
Um,

35
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,630
the husband is bell as monitor the
husband with the kids and she's feeling in

36
00:01:12,631 --> 00:01:13,470
the back of your mind,

37
00:01:13,471 --> 00:01:14,650
like I,

38
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:16,390
sooner or later there's
going to be a myth.

39
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:20,190
There's going to be an accident here and
I'm going to be upset with myself for

40
00:01:20,191 --> 00:01:21,330
not being stricter.

41
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:22,620
But on the other hand,

42
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:23,940
the kids seem to be having fun,

43
00:01:23,941 --> 00:01:25,110
so I should let things go.

44
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:25,451
Well,

45
00:01:25,451 --> 00:01:25,721
you know,

46
00:01:25,721 --> 00:01:26,554
there's a,

47
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:30,610
there's a cycle biologist named Jaak
Panksepp who was one of the world's great

48
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:35,700
biological psychologists and he studied
rough and tumble play in animals.

49
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:37,691
So rats,

50
00:01:37,691 --> 00:01:38,560
for example,

51
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:39,810
a huge part of the,

52
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:44,960
the socialization process that's key to
the development of the prefrontal cortex

53
00:01:45,041 --> 00:01:49,660
in juvenile male routes in particular
emerges and matures as a consequence of

54
00:01:49,661 --> 00:01:50,680
rough and tumble play.

55
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:53,740
And one of the amazing things
that Panksepp discovered it,

56
00:01:53,741 --> 00:01:55,390
and this truly is an amazing thing,

57
00:01:55,391 --> 00:01:56,224
is that,

58
00:01:56,530 --> 00:01:57,363
um,

59
00:01:57,370 --> 00:01:58,120
if you,

60
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:03,120
if you pair two rats together and
then let them play repeated bouts,

61
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:08,800
the big route will dominate the little
route to begin with in the first bout.

62
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:13,720
But if the big rat doesn't let the
little rat win about 30% of the time in

63
00:02:13,721 --> 00:02:14,770
repeated play boats,

64
00:02:14,771 --> 00:02:16,510
then the little rap won't play anymore.

65
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:20,120
So you get an emergent
morality in emergent plays,

66
00:02:20,121 --> 00:02:21,160
centered morality,

67
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:24,280
even among rats as a consequence
of rough and tumble play.

68
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:25,720
And that rough and tumble,

69
00:02:25,721 --> 00:02:28,090
I did a fair bit of research
on rough and tumble play about,

70
00:02:28,570 --> 00:02:30,130
oh it's probably 20 years ago now,

71
00:02:30,131 --> 00:02:31,390
15 years ago anyways.

72
00:02:31,391 --> 00:02:35,560
And it's really quite clear that
rough and tumble play helps children

73
00:02:35,561 --> 00:02:39,250
parameterize their bodies so that
they know how they extend and,

74
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:39,790
and,

75
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:42,090
and also what limits the reason,

76
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:44,650
the use of physical interactions
with another person.

77
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:45,790
What's fun,

78
00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:47,020
what's provocative,

79
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:48,700
what's pushing it too far,

80
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:50,620
what's painful.

81
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:53,560
And of course kids love rough
and tumble play as well.

82
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:54,020
They're,

83
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:55,900
they're just absolutely starving for it.

84
00:02:55,901 --> 00:02:58,330
And we've squeezed it
out of the kindergartens,

85
00:02:58,331 --> 00:02:59,164
the nursery,

86
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:00,490
the elementary schools,

87
00:03:00,491 --> 00:03:01,540
the junior high schools,

88
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:03,520
all of that and for and for bid.

89
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:08,560
And what Panksepp also found was
that if you deprived juvenile routes,

90
00:03:08,561 --> 00:03:11,680
have the opportunity to engage
in active rough and tumble play,

91
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:16,330
that they showed symptoms that were
broadly analogous to those of attention

92
00:03:16,331 --> 00:03:21,331
deficit disorder in human boys and that
you could also treat that with Ritalin

93
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:24,130
the same way in routes
as you could with boys.

94
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:26,710
So there's that rough
and tumble play issue.

95
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:27,071
You know,

96
00:03:27,071 --> 00:03:32,071
and you might think to the question is
one question is why might a mother be

97
00:03:33,191 --> 00:03:36,880
distrustful of the rough
and tumble play episode?

98
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,810
And some of that might be sensitivity
re with regards to the kids,

99
00:03:40,811 --> 00:03:45,811
but huge part of that also is trust on
her trust with regards to the father.

100
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:46,841
You know,

101
00:03:46,841 --> 00:03:48,580
cause it's rambunctious and noisy.

102
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:50,110
And if she trusts,

103
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:54,760
let's say that that act of
masculinity that plays rough,

104
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:57,490
then she'll stay away
and let the fund happen.

105
00:03:57,790 --> 00:03:59,860
But if there's distrust
running through the family,

106
00:03:59,861 --> 00:04:04,600
then then she'll stand between the kids
and the father and then he won't get to

107
00:04:04,601 --> 00:04:07,450
involve himself in that way
and then he'll turn off.

108
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:08,950
And I've seen that happen many,

109
00:04:08,951 --> 00:04:09,850
many families.

110
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:10,481
Okay,

111
00:04:10,481 --> 00:04:11,800
so there's rough and tumble play.

112
00:04:11,801 --> 00:04:12,700
That's a big one.

113
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:13,531
What else is,

114
00:04:13,531 --> 00:04:14,410
what else do you see?

115
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:15,521
Let me take the,

116
00:04:15,521 --> 00:04:18,510
the evolution and how rough and
tumble play goes and all the,

117
00:04:18,511 --> 00:04:18,711
the,

118
00:04:18,711 --> 00:04:21,780
the dimensions of where the
slippery slope that it leads to.

119
00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:24,330
So the father,

120
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,040
the what the mom,

121
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:30,910
either the mom or the dad knew is that
this rough and tumble play leads to the

122
00:04:30,911 --> 00:04:32,590
types of things that you just mentioned,

123
00:04:32,591 --> 00:04:33,760
but you're also evident in,

124
00:04:33,761 --> 00:04:34,030
you know,

125
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:35,290
an elephants and so on.

126
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:39,940
But it also leads to the distinction
between a child being able to distinguish

127
00:04:39,941 --> 00:04:41,770
between being assertive versus aggressive.

128
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:42,620
So the,

129
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:43,610
so the kid starts,

130
00:04:43,611 --> 00:04:44,151
for example,

131
00:04:44,151 --> 00:04:44,810
maybe,

132
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:44,960
Oh,

133
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:48,530
kicking the dad and the of the wrong
place or poking the data and the eyes are

134
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:50,300
pulling the dad's hair and the dad says,

135
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:51,260
I'm sweetie,

136
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:52,280
you can fake,

137
00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:53,203
you can fake it.

138
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:57,010
I contacted the left and then move to
the right to win in this wrestling match.

139
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:58,060
Or you can,

140
00:04:58,060 --> 00:04:58,360
um,

141
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:58,530
you know,

142
00:04:58,530 --> 00:04:59,171
you can do this,

143
00:04:59,171 --> 00:05:00,004
this and this,

144
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:01,750
but you can't do these things.

145
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,390
And if you do do these
things that will stop

146
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:05,403
the rough housing.

147
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:05,741
Yeah.

148
00:05:05,741 --> 00:05:06,221
So there,

149
00:05:06,221 --> 00:05:08,050
so there is a really
important issue there.

150
00:05:08,051 --> 00:05:09,130
So two things there.

151
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:10,330
So imagine that,

152
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:14,200
imagine that a rough and
tumble boat is like a dance.

153
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:15,440
Okay.

154
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:19,030
And the point of the dances so that
both people are having a good time while

155
00:05:19,031 --> 00:05:22,000
it's happening because
otherwise it's not play right.

156
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:25,390
And as soon as either party is
no longer having a good time,

157
00:05:25,391 --> 00:05:28,930
you've actually snapped out of the
cycle biological function of the play

158
00:05:28,931 --> 00:05:29,764
circuit.

159
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:34,000
So basically what you're telling the
child by putting those rules on is we can

160
00:05:34,001 --> 00:05:38,530
interact physically within a very
limited set of parameters and you,

161
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:43,300
what you have to learn to do is to be
sophist a sophisticated player within that

162
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:44,134
set of parameters.

163
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:46,270
And you want to learn how
to push the boundaries,

164
00:05:46,271 --> 00:05:46,511
right?

165
00:05:46,511 --> 00:05:47,770
Because the most fun,

166
00:05:47,771 --> 00:05:51,190
rough and tumble play is right on
the edge between assertiveness.

167
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:52,023
And aggression,

168
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:52,550
right?

169
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:52,840
So,

170
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:53,980
and you can see kids,

171
00:05:53,981 --> 00:05:58,981
like I used to work in daycare centers
when I was a kid when I was 1819 and the

172
00:05:59,121 --> 00:06:02,270
kids would line up to rough and tumble
play with me because that was still

173
00:06:02,271 --> 00:06:02,901
allowable then.

174
00:06:02,901 --> 00:06:04,190
And they were so desperate for it.

175
00:06:04,191 --> 00:06:05,330
It was just ridiculous.

176
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:10,100
And I could really tell the difference
between the kids who had engaged in that

177
00:06:10,101 --> 00:06:11,690
sort of play and the ones that hadn't.

178
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:12,980
And the ones that hadn't,

179
00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:17,180
we're painfully awkward and
they would hurt themselves.

180
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:18,021
And you,

181
00:06:18,021 --> 00:06:18,980
when you wrestled with them,

182
00:06:18,981 --> 00:06:20,480
they'd put their thumb in your eye or,

183
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:24,500
and they would cry often too when
they got surprised but not hurt,

184
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:25,311
you know,

185
00:06:25,311 --> 00:06:28,880
because they couldn't tell the difference
between just being startled and being

186
00:06:28,881 --> 00:06:29,450
hurt.

187
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:30,620
And so they were fragile.

188
00:06:30,621 --> 00:06:32,810
And that also made them
not fun to play with.

189
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:37,310
And the thing that's so interesting about
that too is Piaget talked about this

190
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:39,380
when he talked about the
development of children is that,

191
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:40,400
you know,

192
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:45,400
the more sophisticated pretend play and
then sophisticated cognitive player that

193
00:06:46,311 --> 00:06:48,710
emerges say between five and seven.

194
00:06:48,711 --> 00:06:52,310
And then with the cognitive play older
than that is that unless you have that

195
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:56,930
underlying psychomotor
embodied dance down,

196
00:06:57,230 --> 00:07:01,940
you don't get to really
proceed in a sophisticated
way to those higher levels of

197
00:07:01,941 --> 00:07:04,160
play because other people
don't want to play with you.

198
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:07,220
So the rough and tumble play,

199
00:07:07,221 --> 00:07:09,380
the importance of that
can hardly be overstated.

200
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:10,260
So

201
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:10,720
absolutely.

202
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:10,860
And,

203
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:15,860
and the framework here is that when you
set up a system where you said that men

204
00:07:15,961 --> 00:07:17,250
are part of the patriarchy,

205
00:07:17,251 --> 00:07:17,870
their,

206
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:18,120
their,

207
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:18,451
their,

208
00:07:18,451 --> 00:07:21,990
their desire is to dominate women and
make rules to benefit at the expense of

209
00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:25,260
them at the benefit men
at the expense of women.

210
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,610
You have a framework,

211
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:28,440
an emotional setting,

212
00:07:28,890 --> 00:07:29,730
which does not,

213
00:07:29,731 --> 00:07:31,620
is not conducive then saying,

214
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:34,950
here's my value or women saying,

215
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:39,570
let me see what the checks and balances
of parenting is that leads to the best

216
00:07:39,571 --> 00:07:41,610
of you coming out in the
best of me coming out,

217
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:46,940
all of that has said we skipped over and
inherent sense of father knows best to

218
00:07:47,941 --> 00:07:48,990
father knows less.

219
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:49,730
Um,

220
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:50,130
and,

221
00:07:50,130 --> 00:07:50,730
and,

222
00:07:50,730 --> 00:07:51,210
and we've,

223
00:07:51,210 --> 00:07:51,820
uh,

224
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:53,230
and so the,

225
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:53,830
the,

226
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:54,130
the,

227
00:07:54,130 --> 00:07:58,720
the process that I'll be sharing in a
moment of what rough housing leads to and

228
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,140
the slippery slope that
happens when it doesn't happen,

229
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:01,800
um,

230
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:02,250
is,

231
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:07,250
is what is not even been nurtured as a
possibility to be articulated in this

232
00:08:07,501 --> 00:08:08,210
culture.

233
00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:09,200
I also think too,

234
00:08:09,201 --> 00:08:09,501
you know,

235
00:08:09,501 --> 00:08:10,570
that if you have a,

236
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,150
a partner who hasn't been played with,

237
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:20,170
then that partner can't
tell the difference between
Boisterous rambunctiousness

238
00:08:20,181 --> 00:08:21,020
and aggression.

239
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:26,360
And if there's a hypothesis about
domination and the patriarchy running its

240
00:08:26,361 --> 00:08:27,560
course underneath that,

241
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:31,490
then there's going to be conceptual
confusion about the physical interactions

242
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:35,540
that have the appearance of submission
and dominance because that's part of the

243
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:37,610
rough housing play routine.

244
00:08:37,790 --> 00:08:41,480
It's going to that that is going to
be viewed through a lens of tyrannical

245
00:08:41,481 --> 00:08:44,240
interaction rather than just good fun.

246
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:48,380
And I mean you can tell the difference
because if the kids are rough and tumble

247
00:08:48,381 --> 00:08:49,010
playing,

248
00:08:49,010 --> 00:08:53,960
they're unbelievably enthusiastic about
it and engaged and laughing and giggling

249
00:08:53,961 --> 00:08:57,390
and like they'll play to the point
of exhaustion because they need it.

250
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:58,620
They need it so much.

251
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:02,670
But that's a hard thing to observe from
the outside if you're not accustomed to

252
00:09:02,671 --> 00:09:03,504
that.

253
00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:05,270
And if you don't have that framework of,

254
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:06,133
of um,

255
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,460
of men having,

256
00:09:07,461 --> 00:09:09,230
and dad's having a value to begin with,

257
00:09:09,231 --> 00:09:10,064
absolutely not.

258
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:10,851
So here's,

259
00:09:10,851 --> 00:09:15,851
here's maybe what might be helpful for
a mom to understand at the rough and

260
00:09:16,501 --> 00:09:16,801
tumble,

261
00:09:16,801 --> 00:09:17,200
pray,

262
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:17,940
play,

263
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:18,630
play.

264
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:19,710
We now know,

265
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:22,620
helps children distinguish between
being assertive and aggressive.

266
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,310
But a number of other things off
also happened during that play,

267
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:30,750
which is that is a bond that is created
between the father and the child.

268
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:35,790
And in almost every and doing expert
witness work to help children have both

269
00:09:35,791 --> 00:09:36,121
parents.

270
00:09:36,121 --> 00:09:36,954
You have to divorce.

271
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:39,030
I've observed more than 50 families and,

272
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:44,150
and usually the father interacting with
the children and in almost every case,

273
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:45,050
every case action.

274
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:47,660
Actually I believe that
I have seen there's this,

275
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:50,910
this bond is used by the
father to say things like,

276
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:51,750
okay,

277
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:52,350
um,

278
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:53,131
no more rough housing.

279
00:09:53,131 --> 00:09:54,150
Now tell you what,

280
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:55,830
you get your homework done,

281
00:09:55,831 --> 00:09:57,180
you get your chores done,

282
00:09:57,181 --> 00:09:58,350
you get all ready for bed,

283
00:09:58,351 --> 00:09:58,930
brush your teeth,

284
00:09:58,930 --> 00:09:59,191
teeth,

285
00:09:59,191 --> 00:09:59,401
brush,

286
00:09:59,401 --> 00:10:00,090
whale.

287
00:10:00,090 --> 00:10:00,840
And um,

288
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,130
the bedtime is nine o'clock.

289
00:10:02,131 --> 00:10:03,630
Whenever you get all that done,

290
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:07,860
we'll have between the time you get it
done and the time of nine o'clock in

291
00:10:07,861 --> 00:10:11,220
order for you to have some more fun
either with rough housing or reading my

292
00:10:11,221 --> 00:10:11,830
favorites,

293
00:10:11,830 --> 00:10:13,320
favorite story or whatever,

294
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:14,190
whatever you prefer.

295
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,180
It's your choice.

296
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:15,291
Well,

297
00:10:15,291 --> 00:10:17,270
you know with with Panksepp's work too,

298
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:19,130
he found that the little routes,

299
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:23,540
the routes will work to
enter a play arena because,

300
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,440
because play,

301
00:10:24,530 --> 00:10:27,830
you think play is a so
Panksepp established very,

302
00:10:27,831 --> 00:10:31,580
very clearly that there is a
primary play circuit in mammals.

303
00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:33,680
It's a separate psychobiological circuit.

304
00:10:33,681 --> 00:10:34,880
It's not exploration,

305
00:10:34,881 --> 00:10:36,740
it's a whole different motivational drive,

306
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:41,480
but that the APP but activity in that
circuit is intrinsically pleasurable.

307
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:46,720
And part of that appears to be because
it's so key to proper socialization that

308
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:47,511
it,

309
00:10:47,511 --> 00:10:47,810
it,

310
00:10:47,810 --> 00:10:49,310
it's regarded by,

311
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:52,790
by children and by social mammals
as intrinsically valuable.

312
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:56,450
And so it makes perfect sense that
that can be used as a source of primary

313
00:10:56,451 --> 00:10:56,931
reward.

314
00:10:56,931 --> 00:11:01,931
And I think your comments about the
the man and the kids binding themselves

315
00:11:02,931 --> 00:11:05,840
together through play is also really
important because one of the things that I

316
00:11:05,841 --> 00:11:07,370
do with young men who,

317
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:07,851
you know,

318
00:11:07,851 --> 00:11:12,260
I think young men tend to be somewhat
alienated from infants who are under about

319
00:11:12,261 --> 00:11:16,610
nine months old because they're not really
equipped to know what the hell to do

320
00:11:16,611 --> 00:11:16,910
with them.

321
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:18,740
I mean they can learn and
they can be good at it,

322
00:11:18,741 --> 00:11:22,580
but it's not their domain
of natural expertise.

323
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:26,900
But once a kid hits about nine months
and starts to be able to imitate and to

324
00:11:26,901 --> 00:11:28,010
pound and to,

325
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:31,010
and to play and to
respond to gentle teasing,

326
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:34,010
like that's a perfect time
for the father to swoop in.

327
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:35,810
It's very helpful for a mother by the way,

328
00:11:35,811 --> 00:11:40,280
who wants to have another child and to
start really cementing a relationship

329
00:11:40,281 --> 00:11:43,520
that's based on that
interest in combination of,

330
00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:48,850
of High Energy Fun plus the disciplined
interactions that are necessary as a

331
00:11:50,601 --> 00:11:51,530
precursor to that.

332
00:11:51,531 --> 00:11:52,730
And if you interfere with that,

333
00:11:52,731 --> 00:11:57,050
then you stopped the farther from being
able to form that pro from liking his

334
00:11:57,051 --> 00:11:57,441
kids.

335
00:11:57,441 --> 00:11:58,274
Really.

336
00:11:58,340 --> 00:11:58,521
You know,

337
00:11:58,521 --> 00:12:00,550
because that's how the
liking comes about is,

338
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:01,580
is through play.

339
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:02,721
And so it's,

340
00:12:02,721 --> 00:12:03,560
it's crucial.

341
00:12:03,561 --> 00:12:05,090
It's crucial significance.
