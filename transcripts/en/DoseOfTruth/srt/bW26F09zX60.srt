1
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:07,433
All right.

2
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:13,020
I'm,

3
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:18,020
I'm really kind of hoping that at least
30% of you will be severely unhappy with

4
00:00:19,091 --> 00:00:19,924
this lecture.

5
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:21,460
So,

6
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:21,880
because,

7
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:22,810
and maybe that's wrong,

8
00:00:22,811 --> 00:00:24,100
I'll find out afterwards.

9
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:25,780
This is a very,

10
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:28,330
this dimension of personality.

11
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:34,200
Agreeableness is one of the dimensions
that most particularly differentiate men

12
00:00:35,621 --> 00:00:40,621
and women and obviously the differences
or similarities between men and women is

13
00:00:46,091 --> 00:00:49,780
a matter of hot debate in our society.

14
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:51,753
Um,

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:52,833
and,

16
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:58,210
and I want it run through the
science that's associated with that.

17
00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:00,303
And then,

18
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:04,161
well,

19
00:01:04,161 --> 00:01:05,240
I guess then we'll see what,

20
00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:06,200
what we conclude.

21
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:07,273
No,

22
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:13,720
you remember that the big five were
derived from a statistical analysis of the

23
00:01:13,721 --> 00:01:14,890
content of language.

24
00:01:14,891 --> 00:01:15,724
Hey,

25
00:01:15,790 --> 00:01:20,790
that's kind of interesting because it
means that in so far as any psychological

26
00:01:21,731 --> 00:01:26,731
theory in the history of psychology has
been a theoretical with the possible

27
00:01:27,401 --> 00:01:29,170
exception of intelligence,

28
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:29,980
um,

29
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:30,730
research,

30
00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:34,180
which was also the Iq is
also derived statistically,

31
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:35,703
um,

32
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:41,320
it was derived by golden or
it was initially theorized
by golden in some sense

33
00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:42,970
back in the late 18 hundreds.

34
00:01:42,971 --> 00:01:47,971
But what Golden Thought of as Eminence
bears very little relationship to what

35
00:01:49,001 --> 00:01:49,990
the psychometric,

36
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:53,890
what the psychometricians
measure as intelligence.

37
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:58,950
So intelligence is a statistical construct
or Iq is a statistical construct and

38
00:01:59,381 --> 00:02:02,140
the big five traits are
statistical constructs.

39
00:02:02,141 --> 00:02:04,120
And what that means is that

40
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:09,310
there are theoretical presumptions
that went into their derivation,

41
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:13,600
but it's very difficult to think of
them as political because the first

42
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:16,300
hypothesis was only that

43
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:24,190
the fundamental dimensions of personality
would be reflected in the language

44
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:26,721
English to begin with.

45
00:02:26,721 --> 00:02:30,290
But then other languages as the
research progressed around the world,

46
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,590
it's very difficult for me to
understand that as a political theory.

47
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:34,341
You know?

48
00:02:34,341 --> 00:02:38,300
Cause if scientific findings
have political implications,

49
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:43,600
then you have to wonder if the biases
of the researchers put the political

50
00:02:43,851 --> 00:02:47,270
implications into the data
before revealing them is data.

51
00:02:47,271 --> 00:02:48,680
But it's very difficult to argue that.

52
00:02:48,681 --> 00:02:50,780
I think with regards to trait theories,

53
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:56,090
the other thing that happened with
trait theories is that the statistical

54
00:02:56,091 --> 00:02:59,000
analysis suggested their existence.

55
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:03,410
It wasn't until after the traits
were reasonably well identified.

56
00:03:03,411 --> 00:03:08,411
And this really started to kick in in the
90s that we started to under stand the

57
00:03:09,671 --> 00:03:11,440
potential biological basis.

58
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:11,551
And,

59
00:03:11,551 --> 00:03:12,790
and even the nature,

60
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:17,800
the descriptive nature of the traits
at the aspect level now where you

61
00:03:17,921 --> 00:03:19,870
differentiate the big five into 10,

62
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:23,530
there's still aspects that
we don't know much about.

63
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:24,030
We don't know,

64
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:27,370
like we don't really understand the
difference between politeness and

65
00:03:27,371 --> 00:03:28,204
compassion.

66
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:31,360
We know that liberals are
more compassionate than,

67
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:32,680
than conservatives.

68
00:03:32,681 --> 00:03:35,110
And conservatives are
more polite than liberals.

69
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:39,040
And we think that politeness is
somehow associated with the tendency of

70
00:03:39,041 --> 00:03:41,650
conservatives to follow social rules.

71
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,690
But that's about,

72
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,690
I would say that's about all we know now.

73
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:50,320
We don't even know how much difference
there will turn out to be between polite

74
00:03:50,321 --> 00:03:51,640
politeness and compassion.

75
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:57,360
But were there are ongoing studies
trying to understand the covariates and

76
00:03:59,471 --> 00:04:01,900
correlates of the aspects.

77
00:04:01,901 --> 00:04:03,580
And the same is true of the traits.

78
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:06,003
Um,

79
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:11,380
there was a lot of argument about
openness when it first was discovered

80
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:12,280
statistically.

81
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:17,410
Some people like Hans Isaac who formulated
some of the early three dimensional

82
00:04:17,411 --> 00:04:19,570
models of personality and
that was extroversion,

83
00:04:19,571 --> 00:04:21,910
neuroticism and psychotic racism,

84
00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:25,690
which he thought would
predict the proclivity towards
schizophrenia but actually

85
00:04:25,691 --> 00:04:30,250
turned out to be composed of low
agreeableness and low conscientiousness.

86
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:33,340
Isaac didn't even think that
openness was a reasonable trait.

87
00:04:33,341 --> 00:04:35,770
He thought it was mostly captured by Iq.

88
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:40,090
And actually that seems to be the case
to some degree because if you divide

89
00:04:40,091 --> 00:04:43,210
openness into intellect and
into openness to experience,

90
00:04:43,211 --> 00:04:48,211
it looks like Iq loads on intellect or
at least the nonverbal part of Iq loads

91
00:04:48,821 --> 00:04:53,410
on intellect where the verbal part of
Iq tends to load more on openness and

92
00:04:53,411 --> 00:04:54,100
sodas,

93
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:56,110
openness to experience
and so does creativity.

94
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:58,630
But this is all discovered after the fact.

95
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:04,530
So now one of the things that's
happened as a consequence of parsing out

96
00:05:05,861 --> 00:05:10,861
personality into the big five traits and
also using other traits schemas is that

97
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:16,450
it's quite clear that there
are differences between
the sexes or if you like

98
00:05:16,451 --> 00:05:18,100
differences between the genders.

99
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:23,970
Now this is a thorny problem and
it's thorny for a number of reasons.

100
00:05:24,191 --> 00:05:29,191
One reason is that it's a dogmatic
assumption proposition of social

101
00:05:31,151 --> 00:05:36,151
constructionists that gender
differences are socially constructed.

102
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:38,231
First of all,

103
00:05:38,231 --> 00:05:40,090
they separate out the idea of sex,

104
00:05:40,091 --> 00:05:43,600
which you could think of as bio biological
sex you could think of is chromosomal

105
00:05:43,601 --> 00:05:43,961
sex.

106
00:05:43,961 --> 00:05:46,810
I presume that's one thing,

107
00:05:46,811 --> 00:05:47,710
but gender,

108
00:05:47,711 --> 00:05:51,340
that's a whole different thing and gender
is the manner in which men and women

109
00:05:51,341 --> 00:05:55,090
present themselves to the world
in terms of differences in,

110
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:56,021
well,

111
00:05:56,021 --> 00:06:00,500
anything that you can measure that's
above the fundamentally biological level.

112
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:03,830
Maybe you could say anything
above the chromosomal difference.

113
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:04,120
Okay.

114
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:07,730
I don't exactly know where the
distinction is supposed to be made between

115
00:06:07,731 --> 00:06:09,710
biological sex and gender.

116
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:11,840
It's not a simple thing to understand,

117
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:17,410
but the proposition still obtains that
if there are differences between men and

118
00:06:17,751 --> 00:06:22,550
women at the level of
phenotypic manifestation,

119
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:24,380
then they're socially constructed.

120
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:30,040
The problem with that is that it seems
to be wrong and not just a little bit

121
00:06:30,111 --> 00:06:30,441
wrong,

122
00:06:30,441 --> 00:06:30,951
but wrong,

123
00:06:30,951 --> 00:06:32,030
right to the core.

124
00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:37,570
And one of the things that I would like
to propose to you is that the social

125
00:06:38,421 --> 00:06:41,720
constructionists only
have theory on their side.

126
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:45,830
I don't believe they have any data
to support their claims whatsoever.

127
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:46,461
Now,

128
00:06:46,461 --> 00:06:49,520
I also think that they wouldn't accept
the sorts of things that I'm going to

129
00:06:49,521 --> 00:06:51,140
talk to you about as data,

130
00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:54,290
but that's a whole different argument.

131
00:06:55,090 --> 00:06:55,923
MMM.

132
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:00,970
I don't really understand how
it's possible for people in an,

133
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:06,360
in the modern world to reject scientific
claims given that almost everything

134
00:07:06,401 --> 00:07:10,030
they do in their day to day life that
has anything to do with technology

135
00:07:10,031 --> 00:07:10,900
whatsoever,

136
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:14,770
depends for its function on the
validity of the scientific theories that

137
00:07:14,771 --> 00:07:16,120
underpin the technology.

138
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:21,810
So what that means is that people who
treat scientific data as if it's just

139
00:07:23,081 --> 00:07:24,700
another form of information,

140
00:07:24,701 --> 00:07:28,800
socially constructed information certainly
don't behave like that if you follow

141
00:07:28,801 --> 00:07:30,400
them around in the actual world.

142
00:07:32,850 --> 00:07:35,940
Now here is the proposition
about agreeable.

143
00:07:35,941 --> 00:07:36,181
That's,

144
00:07:36,181 --> 00:07:38,700
I don't know if this is
the case because as I said,

145
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:41,730
there's lots of things we don't
understand about the big five dimensions,

146
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:46,050
but this is how I've worked it out
for my own understanding and it's in

147
00:07:46,051 --> 00:07:48,940
accordance with the data in so
far as I can determine that.

148
00:07:48,941 --> 00:07:49,774
Right.

149
00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:55,420
Agreeableness seems to
be the dimension between,

150
00:07:55,450 --> 00:07:58,840
we certainly know agreeable people were
empathic and compassionate and polite.

151
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:02,020
We know less about disagreeable people,

152
00:08:02,021 --> 00:08:04,060
although we know that they're
more likely to be male.

153
00:08:04,570 --> 00:08:09,100
Now you could associate being disagreeable
with being more callous and more

154
00:08:09,101 --> 00:08:14,101
harsh and more selfish in that if you
had to bargain with someone who's low in

155
00:08:14,291 --> 00:08:15,124
agreeableness,

156
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:19,000
they would fight harder for their side
of the equation than someone high in

157
00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:20,800
agreeableness would fight for.

158
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:22,900
There's now,

159
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:28,510
there's a couple of things about human
beings that that aren't considered

160
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:30,190
sufficiently.

161
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:36,140
I believe in so far as we conceptualize
human personality and one is that humans

162
00:08:37,361 --> 00:08:39,490
are unbelievably maternal,

163
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,170
both genders.

164
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:46,980
They have to be because our babies
are born for a mammal of our size.

165
00:08:47,261 --> 00:08:49,240
That gestation period should be two years,

166
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:51,040
not nine months,

167
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:53,620
and so what that means is that babies,

168
00:08:53,621 --> 00:08:58,410
human babies are already born and you
can tell that because you know like

169
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:01,350
ungulates deer,

170
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:02,330
think gears an ungulate,

171
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:03,253
it doesn't matter.

172
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:05,250
Pretty much as soon as they're born,

173
00:09:05,251 --> 00:09:08,150
they can stagger up on their
legs and start to run around.

174
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:13,460
Whereas a human baby isn't doing that
till 15 months or 13 months or 17 months

175
00:09:13,531 --> 00:09:14,640
or depending on the baby,

176
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:15,391
you know?

177
00:09:15,391 --> 00:09:16,050
So,

178
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:19,860
and babies are pretty much completely
helpless at birth and so they need a

179
00:09:19,861 --> 00:09:21,090
tremendous amount of care.

180
00:09:21,091 --> 00:09:25,710
And then because we have such a large
cortex and because we're so behaviorally

181
00:09:25,711 --> 00:09:26,544
plastic,

182
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:29,610
we have an extraordinarily long
dependence and development period.

183
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:30,750
You know,

184
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:31,650
it's a minimum,

185
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:32,640
it depends on the culture,

186
00:09:32,641 --> 00:09:36,840
but it's a minimum of 13 years and it
can certainly extend far beyond that and

187
00:09:36,841 --> 00:09:41,220
does in cultures where there's a
tremendous amount of inculcation of

188
00:09:41,221 --> 00:09:42,054
information.

189
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:48,080
So we also know that maternal
behavior is very common among mammals.

190
00:09:49,810 --> 00:09:53,400
I mean the very definition of mammal
in some sense has to do with maternal

191
00:09:53,401 --> 00:09:54,900
behavior because mammals,

192
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:58,320
well they bear live young and they
produce milk with their warm blooded.

193
00:09:58,590 --> 00:10:00,570
There's some other characteristics.

194
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:01,763
So,

195
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:07,600
so the ability to care for helpless

196
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:12,840
frequently upset,

197
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,180
dependent

198
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:21,540
creatures for a very long period of time
is part of our behavioral repertoire.

199
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:22,950
Now then you might wonder,

200
00:10:22,951 --> 00:10:26,190
are there individual differences in the
degree to which people are maternal?

201
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:28,080
And I think that's captured,

202
00:10:28,081 --> 00:10:29,730
at least in part with agreeableness,

203
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:33,720
it makes sense because on the
positive pole of agreeableness,

204
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:38,430
that's where you get warmth and compassion
and empathy and a desire to care for

205
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:40,860
others and and self sacrifice.

206
00:10:40,861 --> 00:10:44,300
I would say one of the things will
will show later is the agreeable.

207
00:10:44,301 --> 00:10:46,410
This is negatively correlated with income,

208
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:51,360
which is exactly what you'd expect if
you were negotiating with someone who was

209
00:10:51,361 --> 00:10:54,990
self sacrificing because they're not
going to put forward their side of the

210
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:58,680
power equation as forcefully
as someone who is disagreeable.

211
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:00,031
So,

212
00:11:00,031 --> 00:11:00,541
but you know,

213
00:11:00,541 --> 00:11:04,020
in order to raise a baby you
have to be self sacrificing.

214
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:05,760
There is no two ways about it.

215
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:09,450
You might find that
rewarding and worthwhile,

216
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:14,750
but I don't believe there is a parent
who actually becomes a good parent who

217
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:19,170
doesn't put their child's welfare first.

218
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:22,440
And I think that's
particularly true of mothers,

219
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,260
particularly in the
first year after birth.

220
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:28,080
It's probably true right
up to the age of three,

221
00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:32,490
but I think it's virtually
undeniably true for the first year.

222
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:34,570
Okay.

223
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:35,261
The question is,

224
00:11:35,261 --> 00:11:36,094
is that

225
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:40,690
reflected in personality traits?

226
00:11:40,691 --> 00:11:41,230
Now,

227
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:44,750
the other thing about people that
it's worthwhile recognizing is that

228
00:11:47,890 --> 00:11:48,723
we're hunters.

229
00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:50,260
All right.

230
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:54,820
People aren't coniferous are pretty
good at bringing down big game.

231
00:11:56,770 --> 00:12:00,280
It's reasonable to suppose that the
reason that there aren't as many large

232
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:05,340
animals in North America as there are
in Africa is because when human beings

233
00:12:06,581 --> 00:12:07,600
came into North Africa,

234
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:08,411
North America,

235
00:12:08,411 --> 00:12:09,670
15,000 years ago,

236
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:10,660
they killed all of them.

237
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:12,910
They killed all the mammoths,

238
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:14,680
they killed all the giant bears,

239
00:12:14,681 --> 00:12:15,940
they killed all the cats,

240
00:12:15,941 --> 00:12:16,780
they killed all the,

241
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:18,490
I think there were camels,

242
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:21,130
maybe can't remember precisely.

243
00:12:21,131 --> 00:12:21,551
Anyways,

244
00:12:21,551 --> 00:12:26,551
there was a very large array of very large
mammals and they started to disappear

245
00:12:26,771 --> 00:12:31,771
pretty damn quickly after the period of
time where people migrated into North

246
00:12:32,411 --> 00:12:32,800
America.

247
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:32,921
Now,

248
00:12:32,921 --> 00:12:36,010
one of the theories is that in Africa,

249
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:41,130
the animals and the people co evolved
so that the animals and the people had

250
00:12:41,771 --> 00:12:44,170
fallen into some sort of mutual

251
00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:46,683
stability.

252
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:47,980
But in North America,

253
00:12:47,981 --> 00:12:49,360
that wasn't the case at all.

254
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:50,531
They don't,

255
00:12:50,531 --> 00:12:53,080
I don't think it was that easy to
bring down a mammoth with a sphere.

256
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:58,420
So it was very destructive of
people to do what they did.

257
00:12:58,421 --> 00:13:03,280
But it also says volumes about
what human beings are like.

258
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:08,540
And it's certainly the case
that a nontrivial proportion
of the human population

259
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:10,600
still hunts.

260
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,310
And they'll do that for leisure,

261
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:15,160
which is something that's very difficult
for people who aren't countries to

262
00:13:15,161 --> 00:13:15,994
understand.

263
00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:17,560
And they're almost all men,

264
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:20,350
which I don't think will
come as a surprise to anyone.

265
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:26,760
So I think that predatory aggression
is on the other side of agreeableness,

266
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:33,790
and we also know that the best predictor
of whether or not you're going to be in

267
00:13:33,791 --> 00:13:36,520
prison is low agreeableness.

268
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:37,181
Now,

269
00:13:37,181 --> 00:13:39,130
low conscientiousness also helps,

270
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:43,240
but the fundamental marker of antisocial
behavior in so far as it's captured by

271
00:13:43,241 --> 00:13:46,450
the big five personality markers
seems to be low agreeableness.

272
00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:48,010
And that you might also say,

273
00:13:48,011 --> 00:13:50,170
given that men are less
agreeable than women,

274
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:53,170
that that's part of the reason why

275
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:57,100
men are much more likely
to be in prison than women.

276
00:13:57,130 --> 00:13:59,040
I think it's between,

277
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:01,570
okay,

278
00:14:01,570 --> 00:14:05,920
I think it's 91% of
incarcerated criminals are male,

279
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:10,150
but I'm certain that it's
above 80% I believe it's 91%.
