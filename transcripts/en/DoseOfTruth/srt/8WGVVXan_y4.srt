1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:00,973
Hmm.

2
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:10,890
What is the experience of believing in
God and how is that qualitatively,

3
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:15,020
qualitatively different from a person
who says that he doesn't?

4
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:18,150
I see what you mean by that is that is
part of the question.

5
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:21,090
The question is here while the.
When someone says,

6
00:00:21,091 --> 00:00:23,340
do you believe in God?
No,

7
00:00:23,341 --> 00:00:28,341
there's three parts to that question.
The first question is who is the you to

8
00:00:28,551 --> 00:00:31,820
which they are referring?
Let turns out to not be it.

9
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:35,610
A simple question.
I mean Neesha did a very good job of

10
00:00:35,611 --> 00:00:38,190
taking apart the idea of the eye,
you know,

11
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:41,100
because he was,
he was critiquing descartes' I think

12
00:00:41,101 --> 00:00:43,050
therefore I am.
And,

13
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:45,300
and so the idea,
the first question is,

14
00:00:45,301 --> 00:00:46,950
well,
who is the you to which you are

15
00:00:46,951 --> 00:00:48,990
referring.
The second is what do you mean by

16
00:00:48,991 --> 00:00:51,330
belief?
The third is what do you mean by God?

17
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:56,360
It's like you can't just leap to the
assumption that the person asking the

18
00:00:56,371 --> 00:01:00,660
question and the person answering the
question have the same views on those

19
00:01:00,661 --> 00:01:04,240
and I think that that's,
that's part of the reason why I don't

20
00:01:04,241 --> 00:01:05,080
like the question.

21
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:05,950
You know,
like I said,

22
00:01:05,951 --> 00:01:10,870
well I act as if I believe in God,
and so I would say that's the more,

23
00:01:11,050 --> 00:01:14,020
that's the most fundamental
manifestation of faith,

24
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:18,700
but I could also say I believe and don't
believe in God and saying,

25
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:19,663
well,
you can't.

26
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:23,030
You can't think both of those things at
the same time.

27
00:01:23,031 --> 00:01:23,711
It's like,
well,

28
00:01:23,711 --> 00:01:26,210
hell yeah,
that's what you think.

29
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:27,443
It's,
it's,

30
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:29,700
it's in,
in.

31
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:32,000
When you were asking something that
complicated,

32
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:37,610
then there's absolutely no reason to
assume that you can't have paradoxical

33
00:01:37,611 --> 00:01:40,380
responses to it.
So you could.

34
00:01:40,410 --> 00:01:43,530
You could even say maybe that the
injunction in the old testament is

35
00:01:43,531 --> 00:01:45,630
something like,
you should believe that not believe in

36
00:01:45,631 --> 00:01:48,430
God [inaudible].
It's very complicated.

37
00:01:48,431 --> 00:01:51,610
It's not.
It's not by any means.

38
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:53,400
A simple question.

39
00:01:55,130 --> 00:01:59,560
I don't remember his name though,
but I think perhaps it was a burger or

40
00:01:59,561 --> 00:02:04,170
something like that.
He said that myth is about reconciling

41
00:02:04,171 --> 00:02:06,440
contradictions within the human.

42
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:08,760
Exactly.
That's exactly.

43
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:11,100
Well,
that's what a successful myth does and

44
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:16,370
part of the reason that these ideologies
that we've been discussing feminism

45
00:02:17,451 --> 00:02:21,790
power so much power is because they
actually draw their motive force from an

46
00:02:21,791 --> 00:02:25,250
underlying religious substrate,
but they only tell half the story and

47
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,820
that's what ended theology is.
So when the feminists say,

48
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,900
culture is that tyrannical patriarch,
it's like,

49
00:02:30,901 --> 00:02:31,740
yeah,
that's true,

50
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:37,050
but it's also the benevolent wise king.
So like,

51
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,190
well then they say,
well,

52
00:02:39,191 --> 00:02:41,350
I can't be one and the other at the same
time,

53
00:02:41,351 --> 00:02:42,190
and the answer is,
well,

54
00:02:42,191 --> 00:02:46,390
it's a multidimensional phenomena that
you're encapsulating within a single

55
00:02:46,391 --> 00:02:49,060
category.
It can contain contradictions.

56
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:54,340
In fact it does because society
obviously constraints and and kills you

57
00:02:56,231 --> 00:03:00,050
even like you dye into your neural
configuration because when you were

58
00:03:00,051 --> 00:03:03,320
first born,
you have more neural connections than

59
00:03:03,321 --> 00:03:06,840
you will ever in your life and most of
them die.

60
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:12,460
And so so you dye into your four year
old self and then between the ages of 16

61
00:03:13,611 --> 00:03:15,830
and 20,
you dye into your adult self.

62
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:20,710
And so the idea that the society that
you're in is a terrible tyrant.

63
00:03:20,711 --> 00:03:23,980
That shapes you by death is exactly
true,

64
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:27,610
but by the same token,
it's also almost everything that

65
00:03:27,611 --> 00:03:30,340
ennobles you and enables you to function
in the world.

66
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:34,930
And so the critic,
critics of the Patriarchy say tyranny,

67
00:03:34,931 --> 00:03:35,870
tyranny,
tyranny.

68
00:03:35,871 --> 00:03:36,491
And it's like,
yeah,

69
00:03:36,491 --> 00:03:37,330
yeah,
tyranny,

70
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:42,350
but not only tyranny.
And they say evil man,

71
00:03:42,351 --> 00:03:43,340
evil man.
It's like,

72
00:03:43,341 --> 00:03:44,330
yeah,
obviously,

73
00:03:44,331 --> 00:03:47,600
but not only evil man.
Not only that,

74
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:53,190
and that's why a genuine mythologies,
and I would put Freudian Psycho analysis

75
00:03:53,631 --> 00:03:58,020
in that category because Freud had a
very balanced view of the nature of

76
00:03:58,021 --> 00:04:02,790
being
talks about both parts of the paradox at

77
00:04:02,791 --> 00:04:04,290
the same time,
you know,

78
00:04:04,291 --> 00:04:08,730
it's the dragon and the gold.
It's the terrible devouring mother and

79
00:04:08,731 --> 00:04:10,230
the,
and the Virgin Mary.

80
00:04:10,231 --> 00:04:13,850
It's the tyrant and the wise king.
It's Christ and sait.

81
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:18,370
It's all of those paradoxes stacked on
top of one another.

82
00:04:18,610 --> 00:04:21,300
And then the story about how you go
about dealing with them.

83
00:04:21,550 --> 00:04:23,170
That's a true religious myth.

84
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:25,170
Yeah.

85
00:04:25,170 --> 00:04:27,510
And,
and the dog just takes a part of that

86
00:04:27,511 --> 00:04:28,920
and says,
this is the whole.

87
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:34,810
In early Christianity,
there was a large battle between many

88
00:04:34,811 --> 00:04:36,080
keiths and,
uh,

89
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:41,400
the.
And what would turn out to be the

90
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:45,340
Catholic Church and the mainstream
church and,

91
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:50,610
and they said that the evil evil was the
world we live in is created by this

92
00:04:50,711 --> 00:04:55,260
other force,
the demiurge so that the,

93
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:59,940
they had a very split vision of good and
evil.

94
00:04:59,941 --> 00:05:04,550
But what you're saying and what you were
saying about these ideologies is that

95
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:09,620
basically it's perhaps it's a new formal
theological battle between glowsticks

96
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:14,750
and the people that say that this is,
we have both sides,

97
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:17,570
both sides.
That's a perfectly reasonable way of

98
00:05:17,571 --> 00:05:18,470
looking at it,
you know,

99
00:05:18,471 --> 00:05:22,610
and like young tended towards Manichaean
as to some degree because he was so

100
00:05:22,611 --> 00:05:25,690
struck by say the evils of,
of have nazi-ism.

101
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:28,600
And he,
he had a hard time with the idea that

102
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:32,270
evil was only the absence of good.
But,

103
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:35,740
and I thought about that a lot because
I'm a great admirer of Yoga and you

104
00:05:35,741 --> 00:05:38,200
criticize anything he said at your
peril,

105
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:40,030
you know,
because he was a great genius.

106
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:43,840
But I think that,
I think the Manichaean view is wrong.

107
00:05:43,841 --> 00:05:47,050
I think that what evil is,
is the absence of good.

108
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:50,300
And then it takes on its own life.
I think it's,

109
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:53,230
I mean,
I've written about this in my new book

110
00:05:53,231 --> 00:05:56,860
quite extensively because I have a book
coming out in January called 12 rules

111
00:05:56,861 --> 00:06:00,110
for life,
an antidote to chaos and I'd be trying

112
00:06:00,111 --> 00:06:02,900
to take those ideas apart and to grapple
with,

113
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:05,990
well,
with the fact that human beings hate

114
00:06:05,991 --> 00:06:08,390
themselves because they're vulnerable
and malevolent,

115
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:10,370
which,
which is original sin,

116
00:06:10,371 --> 00:06:12,740
you know,
which is something I'm a great believer

117
00:06:12,741 --> 00:06:13,490
in.

118
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:17,480
Um,
I think it's an unbelievably

119
00:06:17,481 --> 00:06:19,220
sophisticated way of looking at the
world.

120
00:06:19,221 --> 00:06:20,240
You know,
that there's something

121
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:23,540
that,
there was something damaged in the

122
00:06:23,541 --> 00:06:25,240
fabric of being itself.
I,

123
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:28,400
I believe that to be the case.
I think we experienced that as human

124
00:06:28,401 --> 00:06:33,401
beings and that our ethical obligation
is to rectify that and to determine how

125
00:06:35,571 --> 00:06:38,750
to rectify that,
to overcome the vulnerability and

126
00:06:38,751 --> 00:06:42,290
malevolence that like the terror of
vulnerability and the subjection to

127
00:06:42,291 --> 00:06:45,050
malevolence that characterizes our day
to day existence.

128
00:06:45,051 --> 00:06:49,160
That's our,
that's our primary mode of proper being

129
00:06:49,161 --> 00:06:51,680
in the world.
That seems to me to be correct.

130
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:53,600
So,
and again,

131
00:06:53,601 --> 00:06:55,700
that's the sort of thing that I've been
trying to tell.

132
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:58,430
Well those who will listen,
let's say,

133
00:06:58,431 --> 00:07:01,820
but it's so far,
it's mostly been young men who are dying

134
00:07:01,821 --> 00:07:04,280
for this message.
Like they're dying for it,

135
00:07:04,281 --> 00:07:07,100
you know,
it's really Connie's,

136
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:09,230
I go to these talks now,
you know,

137
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:14,560
public talks and where I speak about
responsibility and truth and like after

138
00:07:15,231 --> 00:07:16,160
the talks,
there are

139
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:22,700
crowds of mostly young men who line up
and say,

140
00:07:22,701 --> 00:07:24,110
you know,
I was nihilistic,

141
00:07:24,111 --> 00:07:26,000
I was desperate,
I was suicidal,

142
00:07:26,001 --> 00:07:30,710
I was malevolent and resentful and like
going bad places.

143
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:34,850
And I've started listening to what
you've been saying about myth and it's

144
00:07:34,851 --> 00:07:38,150
like brought me out of that horrible
hole.

145
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:41,540
And it's just one person after another
says the same thing.

146
00:07:41,541 --> 00:07:42,920
You know,
it's so,

147
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:47,780
and I've had thousands of letters like
that and maybe tens of thousands now I

148
00:07:47,781 --> 00:07:52,550
can't even begin to keep up with them.
And well,

149
00:07:52,551 --> 00:07:53,800
thank God for that.
You know.
